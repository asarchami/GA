2,"   By Ayesha Rascoe | WASHINGTON, March 31  WASHINGTON, March 31 The U.S. environmental regulator has raised concerns that a federal review of Sempra Energy's proposed liquefied natural gas export project did not include an assessment of the potential effects of more natural gas drilling.The Environmental Protection Agency issued its finding earlier this month. It urged the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to weigh indirect greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental effects that would flow from the increase in gas drilling needed to support exports from the Cameron plant in Louisiana.The Department of Energy approved exports from the project in February, but the plant must still get clearances from FERC.The EPA's assessment is a fresh angle in the long running debate of how much LNG the U.S. should export. FERC should ""consider the extent to which implementation of the proposed project could increase the demand for domestic natural gas extraction, as well as potential environmental impacts associated with the potential increased production of natural gas,"" the EPA said in response to the commission's draft review of the project.The finding, dated March 3, was released by FERC late on Friday.FERC has long resisted calls from environmental groups such as the Sierra Club to consider the effects of shale gas production in its review of the safety and environmental impacts of LNG export facilities. A spokeswoman said FERC would take the EPA's comments and other public input into consideration as it crafts its final environmental review, currently set for release by April 30.Energy analysts said FERC will probably decide there is no need for an extensive analysis of the indirect greenhouse gas emissions that would be caused by one LNG export project. A federal appeals court ruled in FERC's favor in 2012 in a similar case regarding Crestwood Midstream Partner's  Marc 1 natural gas pipeline. In that case, environmental groups argued that the commission should have done a more expansive review of the impact of natural gas production.""I don't think FERC will defer to Sierra Club's or EPA's issues on the upstream unless or until regulations change,"" said Christi Tezak, energy analyst for ClearView Energy Partners.The shale gas boom, spurred by advances in drilling techniques such as hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, has led to record U.S. natural gas production and paved the way for the United States to become a major gas exporter.Fracking involves injecting water, sand and chemicals underground at high pressure to extract fuel. Critics have blamed the practice for water contamination and say that increased drilling is polluting the air.

3,"  WASHINGTON, April 2 Federal regulators should approve construction of Sempra Energy's liquefied natural gas export project by mid-June, the chair of the U.S. Senate Energy Committee said on Wednesday, arguing that the government needs to move swiftly to keep U.S. gas exports competitive.Louisiana's Mary Landrieu urged the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to release its final environmental review of the project by April 30, as planned, and then to move forward to issue a license.The project, at Sempra's Cameron LNG terminal in Hackberry, Louisiana, won conditional approval from the U.S. Department of Energy to export LNG earlier this year, but it needs permission from FERC before construction can begin. ""We must make certain that the regulatory process for approval of LNG facilities such as (Sempra's) Cameron LNG does not disadvantage American exporters in the battle for the huge international LNG market,"" Landrieu said in a letter to FERC. Landrieu is a major advocate for her home-state project and has taken a more aggressive approach in support of gas exports than did her predecessor, Oregon's Ron Wyden, who raised concerns about unlimited gas exports and their potential to raise domestic prices, hurting the manufacturing sector. Landrieu said her office found that no significant new issues were raised in response to FERC's draft review of Cameron project, which concluded that the plant would not cause major environmental damage.Last month, the Environmental Protection Agency issued a finding that said FERC's draft report was insufficient. The EPA urged the commission to assess the impact of the increased natural gas drilling that would be needed to support gas exports before releasing its final review.

4,"  (Adds details, context)April 30 Sempra Energy moved a step closer to building its proposed Cameron liquefied natural gas plant in Louisiana, after U.S. energy regulators completed a required environmental report for the project, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said on Wednesday.In the environmental impact statement, FERC said its staff concluded the adverse environmental impacts of the project ""would be reduced to less-than-significant levels with the implementation of proposed minimization and mitigation measures and the additional measures recommended by the FERC staff.""The project, at Sempra's Cameron LNG terminal in Hackberry, Louisiana, won conditional approval earlier this year from the U.S. Department of Energy to export LNG, but it needs permission from FERC before construction can begin. Final approval from FERC is expected this summer and building is expected to begin later this year, Sempra said in a statement.  The push toward LNG has been bolstered by a surge in U.S. shale gas production expected to allow the country to become a net exporter of gas in 2018.The proposed facility will have the capacity to export about 12 million tons of LNG per year, or about 1.7 billion cubic feet per day. In addition to the liquefaction plant, the project will also include storage facilities, 21 miles of 42-inch-diameter pipeline and a compressor station.Cameron is one of several LNG export facilities under development in the United States. San Diego-based Sempra has said it expects the facility to enter service in 2019.

6,"  (Adds Sempra statement paragraph 5 and details from order)By Ayesha RascoeWASHINGTON, June 19 U.S. regulators on Thursday approved Sempra Energy's  bid to build a liquefied natural gas export terminal in Louisiana, opening the door to a significant expansion of the American role in global gas trade.Sempra's Cameron LNG facility was the second gas export project to get the green light to begin construction from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the first since 2012, when FERC permitted Cheniere's Sabine Pass project.With the FERC approval in hand, Cameron will likely soon receive its final permit from the Energy Department allowing the facility to export gas to all countries, which would make it the only project outside of Sabine Pass fully licensed at the federal level.The Energy Department issued a conditional export permit for Cameron in February, contingent upon the project receiving a construction license from FERC. ""Today's approval is another important step in delivering natural gas to America's trading partners abroad,"" Debra Reed, chief executive of Sempra Energy, said in a statement.Cameron, Sabine Pass and more than two dozen other projects are in a race to sell relatively cheap, abundant U.S. shale gas to foreign countries where it can fetch higher prices. A vocal coalition of heavy industrial companies, led by Dow Chemical, has argued that this push for gas exports could raise domestic energy prices and hurt the economy if left unchecked.But many Republicans and some Democrats from gas-producing states have pressed for federal regulators to move quickly to issue decisions on applications, warning that the United States could lose out to other countries such as Qatar and Australia seeking to export natural gas.Companies must receive approval from FERC regarding the safety and environmental impact of their projects before they can begin construction. The commission's order required Sempra to comply with more than 75 conditions to mitigate the project's effects on the surrounding area.The Energy Department determines whether requests to export LNG to countries without free trade agreements with the United States are in the national interest.Sempra shares, which posted record highs on Wednesday and early Thursday in anticipation of FERC approval, were near steady at $104.10 in midday U.S. trading.Approval of the Cameron project comes as FERC's review process faces greater public scrutiny. An Energy Department proposal made in May, currently out for public comment, would require companies to have a construction license from FERC before DOE will act on their export applications.

8,"  (Adds background, comment from Senator Hoeven)By Ayesha RascoeWASHINGTON, Sept 10 The U.S. Energy Department on Wednesday approved liquefied natural gas exports from two projects, as lawmakers pressed the administration to move quickly to clear a backlog of applications to ship gas abroad.Sempra Energy's Cameron LNG facility in Louisiana and Carib Energy's small-scale export project in Florida are the first projects to receive final permits from the department to export gas to non-free-trade-agreement countries since Cheniere's Sabine Pass project was approved in 2012.Until now Sabine Pass was the only project fully permitted at the federal level.The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission granted the $10 billion Cameron project a construction license in June after it was issued a conditional export permit by the Energy Department earlier in the year. With the final permit from the Energy Department, the Cameron facility will be able to export up to 1.7 billion cubic feet of natural gas a day for up to 20 years.Cameron, Sabine Pass and more than two dozen other projects have lined up to sell gas overseas. Companies and some lawmakers have complained the department's process has moved too slowly, with the agency pausing application reviews for nearly two years to examine the economic implications of the LNG exports.A vocal coalition of heavy industrial companies, led by Dow Chemical, has argued that the push for gas exports could raise domestic energy prices and hurt the economy if left unchecked. Lawmakers from oil- and gas-producing states welcomed the latest approvals. Senator John Hoeven, of North Dakota, said the orders issued today were a step in the right direction but more must be done.""You need a dependable, rational and certain process for approval,"" Hoeven told Reuters. Hoeven, who has introduced legislation setting a deadline for the department to act on applications, said there is broad support in Congress to address the issue. He said he expects Congress will pass a bill next year expediting the LNG export review process.Facing pressure from Congress, the Energy Department revamped its review process last month, doing away with conditional approvals.The Carib project was approved under this new process, which allows the department to issue decisions on applications only after federal environmental reviews are completed.An environmental review was waived for Carib LNG, a subsidiary of Crowley Maritime Corp, because the exports would be coming from a natural gas liquefaction facility that's already undergone the necessary assessments.Carib's small operation would move up to 0.04 billion cubic feet a day of gas in LNG shipping containers to countries in the Caribbean and Central and South America.

It did not say how much Pavilion would pay for the LNG.Pavilion has also purchased 0.4 million tpy of LNG from Sempra Energy's Cameron LNG project in Louisiana, which will be delivered to Asia according to its production schedule, a company spokeswoman said in an email. The U.S. Energy Department on Sept. 10 gave Sempra the green light to export LNG from the project.Singapore aims to position itself as an LNG trading hub for Asia, with links to producers such as Indonesia, Malaysia and Australia and countries with growing demand such as China, India and Thailand.Temasek Holdings, Singapore's sovereign wealth fund, created Pavilion last year, providing it with a $6.9 billion war chest. Pavilion has already used the funds to buy a stake in a gas field in Tanzania and start an LNG shipping joint venture.A month ago, Pavilion signed a 10-year deal with France's Total to buy 0.7 million tpy of LNG from 2018. BP will supply the LNG from its global portfolio of equity and merchant sources, Paul Reed, chief executive of BP Integrated Supply and Trading, said in the statement issued by Pavilion.""This includes the Freeport LNG Project in the U.S., where BP holds tolling rights and which is expected to reach a final investment decision before the end of 2014,"" Reed said.Pavilion Energy said the time was ripe for an Asian LNG hub as import-export terminals and storage facilities are in place and the region is gradually shifting from long-term contracts to a spot market. The company is also working with the Singapore Stock Exchange, IE Singapore, regional governments and commodity exchanges to develop a Singapore LNG price marker, Seah Moon Ming, chief executive of Pavilion Energy and Pavilion Gas, said at an industry conference.The price gauge will be independent of the oil market and better reflect regional demand-supply balances, Seah said.LNG sold to Asia is mostly pegged to the Japan Crude Cocktail (JCC) price, which is often higher than gas price benchmarks in Europe and the United States.Asian buyers currently pay a premium for LNG, which amounted  to almost $130 billion in 2012, according to Pavilion Energy.While the recent downturn in spot prices ""posed a pricing challenge for gas producers, it was a wonderful opportunity for traders who were able to buy and store spot for seasonal trade"", Seah said.Pavilion Energy has stored an LNG cargo at the Singapore LNG terminal for trading purposes, he said.

15,"  (Repeating for additional clients without changes to text)By Nichola GroomLOS ANGELES, July 2 Fifteen years ago, California led the way to cleaner transit buses with strict tailpipe emissions standards that effectively ushered out diesel as the primary fuel for buses in the state and replaced it with natural gas.Now, California is poised once again to take the lead, this time by mandating a switch to so-called ""zero-emission"" buses by 2040.The new push by California's powerful Air Resources Board (CARB) has the potential to marginalize natural gas as a bus fuel in the same way its adoption once marginalized diesel.In response, the California Natural Gas Vehicle Coalition has proposed expanding the definition of ""zero-emission vehicles"" to include not just electric buses, but also those powered by so-called ""renewable natural gas,"" which is produced from cow manure or decomposing organic matter in landfills.Whereas regular natural gas offers a reduction in greenhouse gases of about 15 to 20 percent over diesel, renewable natural gas offers a reduction of about 90 percent over diesel, according to the coalition .""That's going to be a tremendous step forward over where we are today,"" said Tim Carmichael, president of the coalition, which includes T. Boone Pickens-backed fuel provider Clean Energy Fuels Corp, utility Sempra Energy and engine maker Westport Innovations Inc, among others.The stakes are high. About 60 percent of California buses now run on compressed natural gas, or CNG, compared with 17 percent nationwide. And with roughly one seventh of the nation's 67,000 transit buses operating on California's roads, the state is a crucial market for both bus manufacturers and fuel suppliers.TRADE-OFFS  California's 12-member Air Resources Board will decide the issue next year after a review of available bus technologies.

By contrast, buses powered by diesel or natural gas can travel about 300 miles before refueling.Another potential issue is that power delivery systems at transit agencies would likely need to be upgraded to accommodate electric buses. ""If you have a yard with 200 buses, is there enough power in the neighborhood to run that at this point?"" asked Steve Miller, chair of the California Transit Association's zero emissions bus task force. ""We'd like to see that vetted out prior to a regulation going on the books.""Fuel cell buses have a much longer range than those powered by battery, but they also lack fueling infrastructure.MATTERS OF COST Critics of the proposed regulation have also cited expense as a factor. Battery electric buses typically cost about $800,000, compared with $525,000 for a natural gas bus and less than $500,000 for a diesel bus. Fuel cell buses currently cost about $1.3 million.But electric bus advocates counter by citing the higher cost of natural gas. Fueling a natural gas bus costs about $27,000 annually, compared with $10,500 in electricity cost for an electric bus, according to CARB. Electric buses, advocates note, also have lower maintenance expenses, which means the cost of maintaining an electric bus is roughly equivalent to that of one powered by natural gas when figured over the 12-year average lifespan of a bus.CARB has pledged to spend up to $70 million to support purchases of electric buses this year.The state is also supporting electric bus production. Proterra, a startup electric bus manufacturer, will open a new factory in California later this year with help from a $3 million state grant, and China's BYD was given state tax breaks to make its buses in the state.But even with financial support, transit agencies worry that their systems would have to undergo massive logistical changes to accommodate large numbers of battery electric buses.Steve Schupak, who is running the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority's test of five BYD electric buses, said switching even 15 percent of the agency's fleet over to electric buses ""would drastically change the way we operate.""With renewable natural gas, the industry argues, buses can achieve ""near zero"" emissions without the higher cost of vehicles that are still unproven on the road in large numbers.Moreover, the natural gas players say, even electric buses aren't true zero-emission vehicles. They are pressing CARB to also consider the greenhouse gases emitted by power plants in generating electricity for buses.""Will you just be using natural gas generation to charge the buses?"" said Rodger Schwecke, vice president of customer solutions for the Southern California Gas Company.For the present, at least, demand for renewable natural gas is on the rise, as transit agencies seek short-term ways to reduce their climate emissions. Los Angeles County's transit agency, the nation's second-largest, says it plans to switch all of its buses to run on RNG, a move that will reduce its carbon emissions by more than 78 percent without investing in additional infrastructure, according to spokesman Paul Gonzales.Clean Energy Fuels, the nation's largest provider of natural gas fuel for transportation, said it is on track to sell 40 million gallons of RNG this year, double what it sold last year.

16,"   By Nichola Groom | LOS ANGELES, July 2  LOS ANGELES, July 2 Fifteen years ago, California led the way to cleaner transit buses with strict tailpipe emissions standards that effectively ushered out diesel as the primary fuel for buses in the state and replaced it with natural gas.Now, California is poised once again to take the lead, this time by mandating a switch to so-called ""zero-emission"" buses by 2040.The new push by California's powerful Air Resources Board (CARB) has the potential to marginalize natural gas as a bus fuel in the same way its adoption once marginalized diesel.In response, the California Natural Gas Vehicle Coalition has proposed expanding the definition of ""zero-emission vehicles"" to include not just electric buses, but also those powered by so-called ""renewable natural gas,"" which is produced from cow manure or decomposing organic matter in landfills.Whereas regular natural gas offers a reduction in greenhouse gases of about 15 to 20 percent over diesel, renewable natural gas offers a reduction of about 90 percent over diesel, according to the coalition .""That's going to be a tremendous step forward over where we are today,"" said Tim Carmichael, president of the coalition, which includes T. Boone Pickens-backed fuel provider Clean Energy Fuels Corp, utility Sempra Energy and engine maker Westport Innovations Inc, among others.The stakes are high. About 60 percent of California buses now run on compressed natural gas, or CNG, compared with 17 percent nationwide. And with roughly one seventh of the nation's 67,000 transit buses operating on California's roads, the state is a crucial market for both bus manufacturers and fuel suppliers.TRADE-OFFS California's 12-member Air Resources Board will decide the issue next year after a review of available bus technologies.     But so far, it has said it is disinclined to allow anything but true zero-emission transit vehicles, citing a state goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050.

19,"  Southern California Gas Co is to be arraigned on criminal charges on Wednesday over a huge methane leak near Los Angeles that forced thousands of residents from their homes, officials said.SoCalGas, a division of San Diego-based Sempra Energy, faces four misdemeanor charges for failing to report the release of hazardous materials from Oct. 23 to Oct. 26, and discharging air contaminants beginning on Oct. 23.Attorneys for SoCalGas will attend Wednesday's arraignment in Los Angeles County Superior Court in Santa Clarita, company spokesman Javier Mendoza said. Mendoza said the company operated the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, and did not believe a criminal prosecution was warranted.If convicted, the company could be fined up to $25,000 a day for each day that it failed to report the gas leak to the California Office of Emergency Services, said county District Attorney's Office spokeswoman Jane Robison. The company also could be fined up to $1,000 per day for air pollution violations, she said. The leak stems from an underground pipeline rupture at the company's 3,600-acre (1,457-hectare) Aliso Canyon natural gas storage field. The largest such leak ever in California, at its height it accounted for a fourth of all methane emissions statewide.Methane fumes sickened scores of people and prompted the relocation of more than 6,600 households from the Porter Ranch community at the edge of the field.Southern California Gas Co said last week that it had temporarily controlled the flow of natural gas spewing from a pipeline, but more work needed to be done before the leak would be permanently sealed. ""We provided a prompt notice of the leak to multiple agencies,"" Mendoza said. He declined to provide a list of those agencies or say whether the California Office of Emergency Services was among them.When asked how the company would plead to the charges, Mendoza said: ""We do not believe that a criminal prosecution is warranted and we look forward to presenting evidence ... through the legal process."" Robison said the company may not enter a plea on Wednesday. Los Angeles County prosecutor Jackie Lacey filed the charges on Feb. 2, the same day California Attorney General Kamala Harris also sued the company. SoCalGas also faces a slew of private lawsuits filed on behalf of area residents. (Reporting by Eric M.

20,"  WASHINGTON A new U.S. government task force will look into the country's biggest ever accidental release of methane, which occurred over several months in Los Angeles, California, hoping to prevent future leaks of the potent greenhouse gas from storage wells, the Obama administration said on Friday.The Interagency Task Force on Natural Gas Storage Safety to look at the leak at the Aliso Canyon leak will be chaired by officials from the Department of Energy and the Department of Transportation's pipeline safety office. A months-long leak at the Aliso Canyon storage field made scores of people ill and forced more the temporary relocation of more than 6,600 households from the northern Los Angeles community of Porter Ranch.Scientists said the global warming potential of the release, which began last October and was not plugged until February, was equal to the annual carbon emissions of nearly 600,000 cars.  ""The fact that this leak happened in the first place, the length of time that it took to fix, and the disruption that it caused for so many people are very concerning,"" Lynn Orr, a Department of Energy undersecretary, and Marie Therese Dominguez, the administrator of the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, said in a release.     Aliso Canyon, owned by Southern California Gas Co a division of Sempra Energy, is the country's fourth largest gas storage field of its kind. The utility has minimized the extent of the greenhouse gas impact of the leak, citing early California state data, saying the release represented less than 1 percent of the state's entire annual greenhouse gas emissions.The Energy Department will hold workshops with industry, state and local leaders to develop practices for operation of storage facilities and ensure well integrity and response plans. Findings of the task force will be made public later this year.

TransCanada said on Monday the Sur de Texas-Tuxpan pipeline project would be built through a joint venture with a unit of Sempra Energy and be backed by a 25-year transportation service contract with Mexico's state-owned power company.TransCanada, which will own a 60 percent stake in the 800 kilometer (497 mile) pipeline and be its operator, will invest $1.3 billion in the project. Sempra's unit IEnova will hold the remaining stake.Spectra Energy Corp said on Monday its unit won a contract to build and operate a $1.5 billion natural gas pipeline in Texas, which would connect to the Sur de Texas-Tuxpan pipeline in Mexico. The unit, Valley Crossing Pipeline LLC, will build and operate the 1 billion cubic feet per day pipeline originating at Nueces County, Texas and extending to Brownsville, Texas.The Sur de Texas-Tuxpan pipeline, which is expected to be in service in late 2018, is the largest of three new Mexican projects recently announced by TransCanada.

30,"  U.S. natural gas utility Southern California Gas (SoCalGas) kept fuel supplies flowing as temperatures rose this week, passing its first test of the summer since the closure of its Aliso Canyon storage facility.SoCalGas, a unit of California energy company Sempra Energy, shut Aliso Canyon after detecting a massive leak in October. The company plugged the leak in February.As residents in the Los Angeles area cranked up their air conditioners, SoCalGas said it delivered about 3.3 billion cubic feet of gas and received 3.2 bcf from pipelines, using 0.1 bcf from storage other than Aliso Canyon.With cooler weather on Tuesday, however, deliveries fell to an estimated 2.9 bcf, while pipeline receipts were expected to reach 3.1 bcf, allowing some injections back into storage.In the summer, SoCalGas strives to completely fill the 86.2-bcf Aliso Canyon to prepare for the upcoming winter heating season when gas demand peaks. In January, state regulators ordered SoCalGas to reduce the amount of gas in Aliso Canyon to just 15 bcf because of the leak. That 15 bcf is being held to reduce the risk of gas curtailments and power interruptions this summer. Aliso Canyon, located in Los Angeles' San Fernando Valley, is the biggest of SoCalGas' four storage fields. It provides service to the region's 17 gas-fired power plants, refineries and other key parts of California's economy.SoCalGas forecast demand this summer would peak around 3.2 bcf, with power generators using over 1.9 bcf, noncore large industrial customers like refineries using 0.6 bcf and core mostly residential customers using 0.6 bcf. While the SoCalGas system can accept up to 3.875 bcf of pipeline supplies, it usually only moves about 3 bcf and has not received more than 3.4 bcf per day at any time in the last five years, leaving storage to make up the difference.SoCalGas' three remaining storage facilities have a combined withdrawal capacity of 1.7 bcfd, but cannot make up for all of Aliso Canyon's capability to support demand in the Los Angeles Basin because they are smaller or located too far away. SoCalGas has said it hopes to return the facility to partial service by the end of the summer, but cannot inject gas into the field until it inspects all 114 wells.As of June 17, SoCalGas said it completed integrity tests on 23 wells, nine of which have already been approved by state regulators.

That means there's more work to be done before DOGGR can call for a public hearing for comment on the results. Only after that comment period can DOGGR decide whether the utility has met its obligations. In addition to DOGGR, the state Public Utilities Commission also must approve before the company can inject gas into Aliso Canyon.SoCalGas spokesman Chris Gilbride said on Monday that 23 wells have since passed all tests, 20 of which have already received DOGGR approval.

It supplies natural gas to homes and businesses in Southern California, including power plants and refineries.According to its latest report on Sept. 16, SoCalGas said 23 wells passed all safety tests, 15 awaited test results and 76 were temporarily out of operation. All wells must either pass all tests or be taken out of service before DOGGR can call a public meeting. Since DOGGR must give the public 15 days notice before a meeting, SoCalGas could not start injecting gas into Aliso Canyon until some time in October at the earliest.SoCalGas spokesman Chris Gilbride could not speculate on when the company may complete tests and return the storage facility to service.He said the company has completed all tests on 25 wells and 23 have received final DOGGR approval. In addition to DOGGR, the California Public Utilities Commission must also determine the field is safe to operate.The PUC has directed SoCalGas to maintain a minimum withdrawal capacity at Aliso Canyon to minimize the risk of gas shortages that could result in electricity outages. Once enough wells have passed all tests and received DOGGR approval to meet the PUC's withdrawal requirements, Gilbride said SoCalGas will temporarily plug the remaining wells and take them out of service.Once those wells have been plugged and isolated from the reservoir, SoCalGas can request authority to resume injections, he said.At that point, DOGGR and the PUC would be able to undertake their review and certification process, which will include a public hearing, as provided by Senate Bill 380, prior to SoCalGas resuming injections, he said.

Financing for the pipeline's construction hinges on Odebrecht's full departure from the project as a group of banks have made that a condition to disbursing a $4.1 billion loan.The government of President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, eager to push out stalled infrastructure projects to boost slumping domestic demand, has said it could hold a new auction for the project next year if Odebrecht does not sell its stake soon.Grana, which bought its 20 percent stake in the pipeline project for $215 million in 2015, said it was working on ""alternatives"" to keep the project alive together with Enagas and Italian Techint Group. Enagas controls a 25 percent stake in the pipeline project and Techint wants to buy a 5 percent stake from Odebrecht. ""For Techint nothing has changed,"" the company said in an email.If the government rescinded the contract, Grana would recover its investment thanks to a termination payment clause, it said. The company's shares on the Lima bourse have dropped about 20 percent this week.

Financing for the pipeline's construction hinges on Odebrecht's full departure from the project as a group of banks have made that a condition to disbursing a $4.1 billion loan.The government of President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, eager to push out stalled infrastructure projects to boost slumping domestic demand, has said it could hold a new auction for the project next year if Odebrecht does not sell its stake soon.Grana, which bought its 20 percent stake in the pipeline project for $215 million in 2015, said it was working on ""alternatives"" to keep the project alive together with Enagas and Italian Techint Group. Enagas controls a 25 percent stake in the pipeline project and Techint wants to buy a 5 percent stake from Odebrecht. ""For Techint nothing has changed,"" the company said in an email.If the government rescinded the contract, Grana would recover its investment thanks to a termination payment clause, it said. The company's shares on the Lima bourse have dropped about 20 percent this week. The government said it would probably modify the contract so it is not financed through consumer electricity bills.Odebrecht won the rights to build and operate the pipeline in 2014 after its sole competitor - a Sempra-led group - was disqualified the day of the auction for making last-minute changes to the stake each company held in the consortium.
