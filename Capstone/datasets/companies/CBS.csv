1,"   By Ronald Grover | LOS ANGELES  LOS ANGELES Fox, CBS and ESPN have submitted bids for the rights to broadcast as many as eight Thursday night National Football League games, three people familiar with the bidding process told Reuters, as bidders began assembling for what is expected to be a highly contested auction.NBC, which already broadcasts NFL games on Sunday nights, is expected to join the bidding by Friday night, when bids are due, according to one of the people.Fox, owned by 21st Century Fox Inc, CBS, Comcast's NBC and Disney's ESPN sports channel were among TV networks that the NFL has invited to join the bidding process.Based on the reported $950 million that NBC pays for its package of 19 NFL Sunday night games, an eight-game lineup could be worth $400 million or more. The bids may come in lower because the league wants Thursday night games simultaneously televised on its own NFL Network cable channel along with the winning bidder's network, according to two of the people.Representatives for Fox, CBS and NBC did not return requests for comment. An ESPN spokesman declined comment. The NFL also would not comment. The NFL is seeking bids for a single season, starting this September, people familiar with the matter have said, with the likelihood of extending the contract after its first year. The league will determine how many Thursday night games it will offer based on the specific proposals it receives.The football league is seeking bids for as many as eight of the games now exclusively telecast on the NFL Network on Thursday evenings, in an effort to get higher ratings and boost the match-ups' prominence. The league wants to boost ratings for the Thursday night games to give them the same profile the NFL enjoys for its Sunday and Monday match-ups, according to a person with knowledge of the NFL's thinking.NFL Network's Thursday night games were viewed by an average of 8 million viewers for a 13-game schedule in 2013, a 10 percent boost from 2012 but well below NBC's average 21.5 million viewers for its Sunday night contests.(Writing by Edwin Chan; Editing by Leslie Adler)",2014-01-17,CBS,"Fri Jan 17, 2014 | 5:43pm EST","Exclusive: Fox, CBS, ESPN bid for Thursday night NFL games - sources",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-nfl-bidding-idUSBREA0G1GB20140117?type=companyNews

4,"  * Aims to settle most of its main legal headaches in 2014* Cut pay in CBS unit by 14.4 pct to 5.3 bln euros in 2013* Jain defends his ability to oversee cultural change* Intends to lead regional consolidation after 2015By Thomas  Atkins and Arno SchuetzeFRANKFURT, Jan 29 The reputational risks surrounding Deutsche Bank have grown and it still has some way to go to win back public trust and prove it can overhaul its corporate culture, the bank's two chief executives said on Wednesday.Germany's largest lender is facing an array of investigations into the conduct of its employees and a jump in litigation costs was partly responsible for a surprise 1 billion euro ($1.37 billion) fourth-quarter loss that has heaped more pressure on Anshu Jain and Juergen Fitschen.""We know that here we have something to prove to you,"" Fitschen told reporters at the bank's annual news conference in Frankfurt. ""We have realised that the reputational risk has become more and more significant.""Deutsche Bank paid about 2.1 billion euros in fines in December, but fresh investigations - including one into possible manipulation of the $5.3 trillion-a-day foreign exchange market - have led analysts and investors to forecast an additional 1.4 billion to 2 billion euros in settlement costs for 2014 and 2015.The bank has moved to shake up corporate practices, particularly at its investment banking operations in London and New York, turning down deals viewed as too risky, deferring bonuses for dealers and giving them less leeway on trades. Deutsche Bank cut pay in its corporate banking and securities division to 5.3 billion euros last year, down 14.4 pct from 2012.The number of front office staff in corporate banking and securities fell 2 percent during the year to 8,435, although the compensation figure for that division also includes pay for some other staff, the bank said.Compensation and benefits across the entire bank was 12.3 billion euros last year, down 8.7 pct from 2012.Jain admitted that the more cautious attitude had lost Deutsche business but said he was happy to pay that price and was confident that most of the litigation problems would be sorted out this year.""We are hopeful that towards the end of 2014 we will have the bulk behind us,"" he said. The ability of the duo to oversee the cultural overhaul has met with scepticism in some quarters, given that Indian-born Jain once headed the investment bank at the centre of many of the current tribulations and German-born Fitschen has become embroiled in an investigation into tax evasion.ACCOUNTABLE Jain said he was accountable for the mistakes that were made in the investment bank, particularly during the ""very troublesome period"" preceding the financial crisis, but insisted that Deutsche needs his experience.German financial regulator Bafin questioned the rigour and independence of the bank's internal investigation into alleged rigging of Libor, the London inter-bank offered rate, according to documents leaked to German media. Fitschen, however, dismissed talk of a breakdown in Deutsche's relationship with Bafin.""Don't be led by the tone of voice of one letter,"" he said. ""There are intensive exchanges on every subject, and these exchanges can be described by both sides as open and constructive.""For all its woes, Deutsche has stuck to ambitious earnings goals for 2015. These include return on equity of 12 percent, six times higher than last year, despite a tough trading environment in its core debt markets.The bank is aiming to boost returns by shrinking its balance sheet and is about a third of the way through a crash-diet plan launched in June to cut 250 billion euros ($338.61 billion) from its books.The faster the bank trims, the easier it will be to meet regulators' capital demands.Deutsche said on Wednesday that it expects the reduction of non-core assets to slow this year and that its 2013 dividend will be kept at the same level as the 2012 payout.Jain and Fitschen also said they were well-positioned to lead consolidation in Europe after 2015, though they did not specify when or where deals would happen.Bankers in Davos last week said they expect a European Central Bank (ECB) health check of the euro zone's largest banks this year to reignite domestic and cross-border merger activity by rebuilding confidence among lenders.Jain and Fitschen declined to comment on the apparent suicide of William Broeksmit, a former senior manager at Deutsche Bank. Broeksmit, who retired from the bank last year, was found dead at his home in London on Sunday.",2014-01-29,CBS,"Wed Jan 29, 2014 | 6:25pm EST",UPDATE 3-Deutsche Bank faces up to long battle to restore reputation,http://www.reuters.com//article/deutschebank-idUSL5N0L318520140129?type=companyNews
5,"  By Jennifer Saba and Sruthi Ramakrishnan     Jan 30 Viacom Inc said on Thursday it expects advertising revenue from its cable networks like MTV, Comedy Central and Nickelodeon to improve this quarter, sending shares up 2.4 percent.     The media company, which also owns movie studio Paramount Pictures, said higher ratings for its television shows are also helping coax money from advertisers.     Viacom is the first of the big media conglomerates to shed light on the U.S. advertising environment this year.     ""It is positive news and that is why the stock is up,"" said Evercore analyst Alan Gould about the advertising forecast.     Earlier Thursday, Viacom reported domestic advertising revenue rose only 3 percent for the quarter ending December 31. While pullback was expected, investors were encouraged that demand for commercials is returning.     Viacom Chief Executive Philippe Dauman blamed the November budget crisis in Washington that spooked advertisers.     ""That created a lot of uncertainty in the business community,"" Dauman said on an analyst call. ""That dissipated once the deal occurred.""     Advertiser demand is ""back to normal"" he added and Viacom expects domestic ad revenue to improve this quarter.     The company reported a 4 percent drop in total revenue for the quarter ending December to $3.2 billion, roughly in line with analysts estimates of $3.30 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.     The drop off resulted from fewer movie releases from its studio Paramount Pictures, which reported a 30 percent decline in filmed entertainment revenue to $681 million.       Net income from continuing operations rose to $547 million, or $1.20 per share, from $473 million, or 93 cents per share, a year earlier.      Excluding items, the company earned $1.20 per share from continuing operations, above analysts' estimate of $1.16, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

23,"   By Nate Raymond | NEW YORK, March 19  NEW YORK, March 19 The former chief executive of bankrupt online music storage firm MP3tunes was found liable Wednesday for infringing copyrights for sound recordings, compositions and cover art owned by record companies and music publishers once part of EMI Group Ltd.A federal jury in Manhattan found Michael Robertson, the former MP3tunes chief executive, and the defunct San Diego-based company liable on various claims that they infringed on copyrights associated with artists including The Beatles, Coldplay and David Bowie.The jurors also found MP3tunes was willfully blind to copyright infringement on its website, in what a lawyer for the recording companies suggested before the verdict would be the first ruling by a jury of its kind.The verdict marked a victory for the music industry in its long-running legal battle against online content providers, which it accuses of illegally selling its works without permission, costing revenue and profit.Jurors will now decide how much in damages should be awarded after the verdict and an earlier ruling by the judge finding them liable on certain copyright claims. The damages phase is expected to run two to three days.Both Ira Sacks, a lawyer for Robertson, and Andrew Bart, a lawyer for the EMI recording labels, declined to comment. Frank Scibilia, a lawyer for the EMI publishing companies, did not respond to a request for comment. Founded in 2005 and once known as a website selling independent musicians' songs, MP3tunes came to be known for its so-called cloud music service that allowed users to store music in online lockers.EMI, however, contended in its 2007 lawsuit that the San Diego-based company's website and a related one called Sideload.com enabled the infringement of copyrights in sound recordings, musical compositions and cover art.More than 2,100 copyrights were at issue in the liability phase of the trial, Sacks said before the verdict. At trial, Sacks argued Robertson should not be held liable, and argued that the record companies themselves made free promotional copies of their music available online. The few times users abused the locker system, MP3tunes found out and shut them down, Sacks told jurors at the trial, which was before U.S. District Judge William Pauley.While the jury largely sided with the EMI recording and publishing companies, it found for Robertson on some claims, including by deciding not to hold him liable for MP3tunes' failure to remove files from users' online ""lockers"" the website provided users to store music.When initially launched, the lawsuit was closely watched as a barometer for how courts might view cloud-based music storage services that came to be offered by companies including Amazon.com Inc, Apple Inc and Google Inc . Much has changed with the companies since the lawsuit was filed. EMI has been split up, its recording music business acquired by Vivendi SA's Universal Music Group and a consortium led by Sony Corp acquiring its publishing arm in 2012.MP3tunes meanwhile filed for bankruptcy in May 2012. The MP3tunes litigation moved forward as EMI looked to build on  recording industry court victories in cases involving file-sharing services Napster, Grokster, and LimeWire.Robertson had in 1997 founded another website, MP3.com, that let users play music that the company had copied from thousands of CDs it purchased, so long as users could demonstrate they already owned the music.That service also prompted litigation, and a federal judge's ruling against MP3.com in 2000 led to a shutdown of the service and more than $160 million in estimated payouts by the company to the five major record labels and music publishers.MP3.com was a year later sold to Vivendi Universal for about $372 million. The website is today owned by CBS Corp.The case is Capital Records Inc et al v. MP3tunes LLC et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 07-09931.

25,"  CBS Outdoor Americas Inc's CBSO.N said it priced its initial public offering at $28 per share, valuing the outdoor advertising company at about $3.36 billion.CBS Outdoor, part of media conglomerate CBS Corp (CBS.N), will raise about $560 million from the offering of 20 million shares at that price, which is at the high-end of its planned $26 and $28 range.The company's shares will start trading on Friday on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ""CBSO.""CBS, which will reduce its stake to 83 percent after the offering, plans to convert CBS Outdoor into a real estate investment trust (REIT).As a REIT, it can avoid paying corporate-level income taxes if it distributes at least 90 percent of its taxable income to shareholders in the form of dividends. CBS Outdoor had about 330,000 displays in the United States and about 26,200 displays across Canada and Latin America as of December 31. The company has displays in some of the most heavily trafficked locations such as the Bay Bridge in San Francisco, Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles and Grand Central Station and Times Square in New York City.The New York-based company counts Apple Inc (AAPL.O), McDonald's Corp (MCD.N), Sony Corp (6758.T) and Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) among its major customers. Outdoor advertising companies have been converting their traditional billboards to digital billboards as it allows them to run multiple ads on each display. As of December 31, 2013, CBS Outdoor had 373 digital billboard displays in the United States.CBS has moved to diversify its revenue away from advertising, in part by selling shows to subscription video on-demand services such as Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) and Hulu Plus.

The IPO raised about $560 million. CBS Outdoor's shares were up 6.25 percent at $29.75 in early afternoon trading, while those of CBS Corp, which has a market value of about $36.5 billion, were up 1.6 percent at $62.46.CBS Outdoors Chief Executive Jeremy Male said he aimed to convince big advertisers to move more of their spending to his company's billboards and other displays.U.S. outdoor media represents less than 5 percent of advertising spending, compared with 8 percent in the rest of the world, Male said in an interview.""The top 50 advertisers only spend 2 percent of revenue on outdoor,"" said Male, who joined the company in September after serving as a top executive at JCDecaux SA, the world's largest outdoor company.

31,"   By Ronald Grover and Steve Gorman | LOS ANGELES  LOS ANGELES Comedian David Letterman, who brought a sardonic, offbeat wit to late-night television, along with bits such as ""Stupid Pet Tricks"" and his ""Top Ten"" list, will retire as host of ""The Late Show"" on CBS in 2015, he said during the taping of his show in New York.Letterman, 66, whose contract expires next year, began hosting the CBS show in August 1993, after leaving the rival NBC network, where he originated his late-night TV persona and much of his program on the ""Late Night with David Letterman"" show for many years.There was no immediate word on who might succeed Letterman in the key 11:30 p.m. slot on CBS, opposite NBC's top-rated ""The Tonight Show.""The Emmy-winning host said he had spoken in the past with CBS Corp President and Chief Executive Officer Leslie Moonves, ""and we agreed that we would work together on this circumstance and the timing of this circumstance.""And I phoned him just before the program, and I said, 'Leslie, it's been great, you've been great, and the network has been great, but I'm retiring,'"" Letterman told his studio audience, according to a CBS transcript.""We don't have the timetable for this precisely down - I think it will be at least a year or so, but sometime in the not-too-distant future, 2015 for the love of God,"" he added.CBS said Letterman's announcement elicited a standing ovation from the audience in the Ed Sullivan Theater.Letterman's impending departure from CBS marks the latest in a recent rearrangement of the late-night deck chairs at the major networks. News of Letterman's plans to retire came nearly two months after Jay Leno bid farewell as host of NBC's ""The Tonight Show,"" a job Leno assumed in 1992 in a bitter and highly publicized succession of Johnny Carson that led to Letterman's defection from NBC.Leno was replaced by Jimmy Fallon, who had hosted the show that airs after ""The Tonight Show,"" and Fallon in turn was succeeded by comedian Seth Meyers, who like Fallon is an alumnus of ""Saturday Night Live.""Letterman, a late-night fixture for three decades, had jumped ahead of ""The Tonight Show"" in the ratings as recently as 2010, when ""Tonight"" was briefly hosted by Conan O'Brien.RIVALRY AND INNOVATION  Fallon's show averaged 5.1 million viewers a week, compared with 2.9 million for Letterman, according to Nielsen.Although ""Late Show"" trailed ""Tonight"" in the ratings war, Letterman long reigned as the critics' favorite, known for an edgier, irreverent brand of humor and signature bits like ""Stupid Pet Tricks"" and the nightly Top-10 list poking fun at current events and pop culture.He also was a practitioner of such innovations as the ""Monkey Cam,"" in which a TV camera was strapped to a monkey turned loose in the studio; a bit where he dropped objects such as melons and television sets off a high platform and played the results back in slow motion; and stunts such as throwing himself onto a Velcro-covered wall or dunking himself in a pool dressed in a suit covered in Alka-Seltzer tablets.But his show had its more sober moments as well. Veteran CBS newsman Dan Rather famously showed the strain of reporting on the suicide hijacking attacks that destroyed the World Trade Center when he choked back tears during a guest appearance for Letterman's first broadcast after the September 11, 2001 disaster.

The three shows together generated more than $400 million in advertising sales in 2012, according to the latest numbers available from ad tracking firm Kantar Media.And the three shows all remain large, though shrinking, profit centers because the networks cram in more commercials per hour late at night than they do in prime time, said Brad Adgate, research director at media and advertising firm Horizon Media. Production costs are held down, with guests being paid at union scale rates, he said.CBS has not said who might succeed Letterman, but the network needs to find someone who can siphon away some of Fallon's younger viewers, media executives said. Fallon has also developed a huge social network following, an increasingly important marketing avenue for networks to promote their shows.YouTube registered more than 4 million views of Fallon's parody of Bruce Springsteen's hit song ""Born to Run,"" in which he and Springsteen lampooned New Jersey Governor Chris Christie's bridge-closing scandal.Craig Ferguson, star of CBS's ""The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson"" at 12:35 a.m., was reportedly promised Letterman's slot in 2012 when CBS renewed the contracts for the two men.

40,"   By Eric Kelsey | LOS ANGELES  LOS ANGELES A new kind of Stephen Colbert will be coming to late-night network television as he succeeds CBS's ""Late Show"" host David Letterman next year, capping the generational shift in late-night TV's landscape across U.S. networks eager to attract younger viewers and online followings.Colbert, 49, who made his mark satirizing political conservatives on his Comedy Central weeknight cable show ""The Colbert Report,"" said on Thursday he would drop his known persona of a dim-witted, big-egoed conservative pundit.""I won't be doing the new show in character, so we'll all get to find out how much of him was me. I'm looking forward to it,"" Colbert said in a statement.There is a measure of risk in abandoning a groundbreaking formula for the comedian whose Emmy-winning show has attracted a strong audience among young viewers, a coveted group that CBS is surely eyeing with its choice of Colbert.""A lot of his audience has never seen him as himself,"" said TV analyst David Bianculli. ""He'll bring a lot of that sensibility to it, but it will be a different tone.""But for the comedian who plays the court jester to U.S. politics and is known for inventing zeitgeist catch phrases like ""truthiness,"" he has a chance to distinguish himself against rivals as an expert interviewer as he has often done on ""The Colbert Report"" and first as a member of the cast of ""The Daily Show with Jon Stewart.""""I think it's smarter than turning it over to someone who has never done the job of interviewing, which he does really well,"" said Bianculli.'WE JUMPED AT IT' Jimmy Fallon, 39, who took over NBC's ""The Tonight Show"" from Jay Leno in February, and Seth Meyers, Fallon's 40-year-old replacement on the network's ""Late Night"" program, each developed their comic touch as performers on sketch comedy program ""Saturday Night Live."" ""Colbert's talent at playfully bantering with guests ... also reflects a contrast with Jimmy Fallon, who despite his knack for musical parodies and viral videos can at times be cloying or empty in the interview format,"" wrote Brian Lowry, the TV columnist for trade publication Variety.Details of how the format of ""Late Show"" will change under Colbert's stewardship, or whether it will remain based in New York City, have yet to be determined.CBS Entertainment Chairman Nina Tassler said Colbert's representative approached the network about Letterman's spot.""When his name was brought to our attention, we jumped at it. He stood out above the rest,"" she said, noting that Letterman gave his blessing. What is sure is that CBS will be making a play to expand on Colbert's Comedy Central audience and capitalizing on his Twitter following of 6.2 million, which dwarfs the 286,000 at the ""Late Show.""Colbert's half-hour show attracts an average of 1.1 million viewers to the Viacom Inc-owned network, according to Nielsen, less than half as many as those who tune into the ""Late Show."" That number is miniscule in relation to his cultural impact.Colbert's audience has a median age of 42 years, 16 years younger than Letterman's. Ad sales for ""The Colbert Report"" rose slightly last year while advertising for ""Late Show"" declined in 2013, according to ad tracking firm Kantar Media.Fallon, who has been able to create a strong following on YouTube and has 12.3 million Twitter followers, has lifted the ""Tonight"" audience by bringing in younger viewers, and attracts twice as many viewers under the age of 50 as Letterman.The late-night hosts compete for viewers with cable offerings such as the comedy programming on Time Warner Inc's Adult Swim, which draws nearly 1.2 million 18-to 49-year olds on average during the same time slot, according to Nielsen. That's more than either Kimmel or Letterman in the age group most desired by advertisers. FROM CABLE TO BROADCAST Unlike his late-night rivals, Colbert has burnished his image by tackling political issues with the biting satire of his self-described ""fool"" persona.Although early reaction has been positive to Colbert's hiring, some have wondered if the South Carolina native's backhanded skewering of conservatives - with lines like ""reality has a well-known liberal bias"" that have made him a favorite on the left - could stand in his way of establishing wide appeal outside of his niche cable personality.""He's (a) smart and genial fellow who's a good enough actor and improviser to pull off breathtaking satire, but has never spent any appreciable time on camera,"" wrote Wired's Peter Rubin, adding that audiences may find Colbert's fictional persona preferable to him unfiltered.But in a signal of how he can connect out of character, Colbert touched viewers last year when he dropped his bloviating persona in a moving tribute to his late mother.CBS believes he will have enough versatility to work on a broadcast network show.""He is so nimble, and so smart and quick-witted,"" Tassler said.

45,"  LOS ANGELES, April 23 The annual MTV Video Music Awards, one of the music industry's top televised showcases, will return to Los Angeles this summer from New York City, the U.S. cable channel said on Wednesday.The show, popular among MTV's young viewers prized by advertisers, will take place on Aug. 24, the day before TV's Emmy Awards, at the Forum in Inglewood, California, about eight miles southwest of downtown Los Angeles.The Video Music Awards, which hand out ""Moonman"" statuettes of an astronaut planting an MTV flag, can be crucial exposure for singers and bands and is best known for its unscripted and often provocative moments. At last year's show in Brooklyn, singer Miley Cyrus' sexually explicit ""twerk"" dance overshadowed the awards ceremony and dominated news headlines the following week. And just as last year's show helped unveil the new Barclays Center in Brooklyn, this year's show will also help relaunch Madison Square Garden Co's recently renovated Forum, an arena which had been bypassed by major events since the Staples Center opened in downtown Los Angeles in 1998. The Video Music Awards began in 1984 and helped propel the young cable channel, now owned by Viacom Inc, as a player in the entertainment industry.A host for this year's show has not yet been announced, and MTV may go without one, similar to last year.

52,"  British media baron Richard Desmond will announce that he is selling free-to-air TV broadcaster Channel 5 to U.S.-based Viacom Inc for up to 450 million pounds ($760 million), The Guardian reported On Wednesday, without citing sources.Viacom, which owns cable networks such as MTV, Nickelodeon and Comedy Central, is also expected to announce the deal on Thursday when it reports its financial results, the paper said on its website. (link.reuters.com/fac98v)Channel 5, which broadcasts ""Big Brother,"" was bought by Desmond's Northern & Shell media group in 2010 for 103.5 million pounds.

55,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, May 01 (Fitch) In Fitch Ratings' view, Viacom Inc.'s (Viacom) 'BBB+'  Issuer Default Rating (IDR) is not affected by the company's announcement to  acquire Channel 5 Broadcasting Limited (Channel 5). A full list of Fitch's  ratings on Viacom follows at the end of this release. Viacom announced the acquisition of Channel 5 for BP450 million (approximately  $757 million) and the purchase price will be funded with existing cash held  outside the U.S. Viacom's consolidated cash balance totaled approximately $1.97  billion (pro forma for April's redemption of the $600 million 4.375% notes due  2014).  The Channel 5 acquisition expands Viacom's international footprint in Britain  providing a platform to leverage Viacom's popular content in the fast growing  international marketplace (currently 25% of sales). Further in line with  Viacom's strategy to increase investment in original programming, Fitch expects  Viacom to increase its programming and production investment in Channel 5 and  leverage this programming across Europe.  Channel 5's business consists of  broadcast channels including its public sector broadcasting channel.  Fitch  believes the company generated approximately $600 million of largely  advertising-based revenue during 2013. Operating margins generated by Channel 5  are expected to be consistent with Viacom's international business margins which  range in the low- to mid-teens.   The acquisition is not expected to affect the pace of anticipated share  repurchases.  Shareholder returns exceeding free cash flow (FCF) generation are  incorporated into current ratings to the extent that leverage remains at or  below Fitch's 3x total leverage threshold.  Viacom repurchased 10 million shares  of its common stock during the quarter ended March 31, 2014 for approximately  $850 million.   Share repurchases are expected to exceed $3.25 billion for the  fiscal year ending September 2014.  Fitch expects that Viacom will manage its  share repurchase program within the context of its 2.75x to 3x leverage target.  Fitch believes that Viacom will place a priority on managing its balance sheet  to its leverage target and curtail the level of share repurchases in the event  the macro-economic environment weakens or the company's operating profile begins  to deteriorate.  As of March 31, 2014, Viacom had approximately $8 billion of  capacity under its share repurchase program. Fitch calculates leverage at approximately 2.9x pro forma for April's  redemption. Fitch expects Viacom to manage its leverage within its stated  targets of 2.75x to 3x range. Total face value of debt outstanding after the  April redemption was approximately $13.2 billion.  In Fitch's view, Viacom's liquidity is strong and supported by expected FCF  generation.  Additional financial flexibility is provided by the company's $2.5  billion revolving credit facility (fully available as of March 31, 2014) and  $1.97 billion of cash on hand.  Commitments under Viacom's revolver expire on  Nov. 9, 2017.  Upcoming maturities, pro forma for the redemption discussed  above, include $850 million due in 2015, approximately $1.3 billion due in 2016  and $1 billion due in 2017.  The maturities are well-laddered and manageable  considering expected FCF generation, reliable market access and back-up  liquidity.  Overall, Fitch's ratings incorporate Viacom's strong and consistent FCF, high  level of financial flexibility, solid credit protection metrics, sound  liquidity, and leading market positions within its core businesses in numerous  attractive demographics.  A level of ratings volatility at any given network is  also factored into the ratings. Fitch anticipates the company's operating  profile will strengthen in fiscal 2014 largely based on stable macro-economic  and advertising markets, improving ratings within key networks, and double-digit  affiliate revenue growth. Rating concerns center on the company's ability to adapt to changing media  consumption patterns and technology platforms as well as its capacity to deliver  programming to its cable networks that drives incremental share of an  increasingly fragmented viewing audience.  Additional ratings considerations  include Viacom's exposure to cyclical advertising revenues (moderate relative to  peer group) and the inherent volatility of the company's Filmed Entertainment  business segment. Fitch's ratings for Viacom are as follows:  --Long-term IDR 'BBB+'; --Senior unsecured notes and debentures 'BBB+'; --Senior unsecured bank facility due 2017 'BBB+'; --Short-term IDR 'F2'; --Commercial paper 'F2'.

Shares of Bristol-Myers Squibb Co shot up 3 percent to $49.73. The rally came a day after the drugmaker said a late-stage trial testing its immunotherapy nivolumab in advanced melanoma patients was halted early after it was determined that the drug was likely to prolong survival.Pfizer gained 1.7 percent to $29.80, Merck & Co.  rose 1.6 percent to $58.86, and the S&P healthcare index  ended 1.1 percent higher, giving the S&P 500 its biggest boost.Shares of CBS jumped 6.2 percent to $62.48 after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that online TV startup Aereo Inc violates copyright law by using tiny antennas to provide subscribers with broadcast network content via the Internet.  Comcast Corp shares rose 1.1 percent to $53.21. Shares of the Walt Disney Co, which owns ABC News, advanced 1.5 percent to $83.90 and helped bolster the Dow. The S&P 500's gains followed two days of losses, putting the index on track for a decline of 0.2 percent for the week.""You do hear people talking about us being in some kind of a bubble, but I do not see that at all,"" said Bryant Evans, investment advisor and portfolio manager at Cozad Asset Management, in Champaign, Illinois. ""The stock prices are reflecting reasonable valuations."" The Dow Jones industrial average rose 49.38 points or 0.29 percent, to 16,867.51. The S&P 500 gained 9.55 points or 0.49 percent, to 1,959.53. The Nasdaq Composite  added 29.40 points or 0.68 percent, to 4,379.76.Monsanto Co also boosted the S&P 500. The stock climbed 5.1 percent to $126.73 after the world's largest seed company raised the low end of its full-year outlook. Monsanto also said it plans to offer debt to help it finance a $10 billion stock buyback.The healthcare sector also benefited from more merger news. Medical Action Industries surged 93.5 percent to $13.68 on its heaviest one-day volume ever after Owens & Minor Inc  agreed to buy the company for about $208 million. Owens rose 1.5 percent to $35.38.On the downside, shares of refiners declined after U.S. officials allowed energy companies to export light crude oil, or condensate, after it has been minimally processed. Valero Energy , down 8.3 percent at $51.35, was the S&P 500's biggest percentage decliner, followed by Marathon Petroleum, down 6.3 percent at $80.97.The major indexes slipped at the open after the economic data, but investors quickly moved on. The U.S. economy contracted in the first quarter at an annual rate of 2.9 percent, the sharpest drop in five years, though activity was affected by a harsh winter, and there are indications that growth has since rebounded. In another negative data point, U.S. orders for durable goods unexpectedly fell 1 percent in May.

77,"  (Adds details on Diller and impact, CBS chief executive Moonves comment)By Lawrence Hurley and Jonathan StempelWASHINGTON, June 25 Broadcast and cable TV are not dead yet.In a decision that could crimp consumers' hopes to cut the cord from their cable operators, the U.S Supreme Court said Aereo Inc, a video streaming service backed by media mogul Barry Diller, violated copyright law by using tiny antennas to broadcast TV content online to paying subscribers.Wednesday's 6-3 decision, written by Justice Stephen Breyer, is a victory for traditional broadcasters such as CBS Corp , Comcast Corp's NBC, Walt Disney Co's  ABC, and Twenty-First Century Fox Inc's Fox.It may also make it harder for Internet rivals to provide alternative, a la carte programming at cut-rate prices, and casts Aereo's own future into doubt.""As convenient and as fun as it is for the consumer, an adverse decision would have completely changed the business model of Hollywood and of movies and TV,"" said Roger Entner, a telecommunications analyst at Recon Analytics LLC in Boston.The decision may also raise concern for other technologies, such as cloud computing, that innovation would be stifled by making it too easy to deem use of certain content as theft. The Supreme Court majority played down that issue, saying it would wait for a case that specifically addressed such technologies. AS SEEN WITH CABLE TV Started in 2012 and backed by Diller's IAC/InterActiveCorp , Aereo typically costs about $8 to $12 a month, and lets users stream live broadcasts on mobile devices. Aereo does not pay the broadcasters. The service has operated in 11 U.S. cities, and does not provide subscriber data.Writing for the majority, Breyer said Aereo is ""not simply an equipment provider,"" but rather bears an ""overwhelming likeness"" to cable TV companies whose ability to retransmit broadcasts was limited under a 1976 copyright law.Any differences, he said, ""concern not the nature of the service that Aereo provides so much as the technological manner in which it provides the service,"" which he said constituted a public performance of copyrighted content.Breyer agreed with the federal government that it was premature to suggest the decision could doom cloud-based services where TV shows, music and other content are stored on the Internet via servers from Google Inc, Microsoft Corp, DropBox Inc and Box Inc, among others.Joining the majority were Chief Justice John Roberts, and Justices Anthony Kennedy, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan. Justice Antonin Scalia, joined by fellow conservative Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, dissented, likening Aereo to a ""copy shop that provides its patrons with a library card"" and lets them decide what to view.Scalia said he shared the majority's ""evident feeling"" that Aereo's activities ""ought not to be allowed.""But he said the majority distorted copyright law, and should have let Congress fashion a solution better than ""the crude 'looks-like-cable-TV' solution the Court invents.""For the networks, the victory protects the estimated $3 billion in so-called retransmission fees that broadcasters get from cable and satellite TV systems. Some broadcasters had threatened to cut off their free signals or create their own low-cost Internet feeds had Aereo won.The decision also helps professional sports leagues such as Major League Baseball and the National Football League, which have lucrative licensing contracts with broadcasters and said an Aereo victory could force them to move all games to cable TV. AEREO LAMENTS ""MASSIVE SETBACK"" Chet Kanojia, Aereo's chief executive, called the decision ""a massive setback"" for American consumers, but stopped short of saying it means the end of the service.""Free-to-air broadcast television should not be available only to those who can afford to pay for the cable or satellite bundle,"" he said in a statement. ""We are disappointed in the outcome, but our work is not done.""Diller, 72, is known for pushing the boundaries of traditional media. He helped start the Fox network in 1986, defying naysayers who saw no room for a fourth U.S. broadcast network. Fox proved to have staying power, and became known for embracing programming risks such as scheduling ""The Simpsons"" cartoon to run against the NBC powerhouse ""The Cosby Show.""IAC, which he now chairs, holds assets such as the comedy site CollegeHumor and the video sharing site Vimeo.In an emailed statement, Diller said about the Aereo decision: ""It's not a big (financial) loss for us, but I do believe blocking this technology is a big loss for consumers."" Diller is worth about $2.5 billion, Forbes magazine said.Broadcasters' share prices rose after the decision was announced, and CBS shares closed 6.2 percent higher.""This is a terrific victory for anybody who's involved in the content business,"" and encourages the production of more programming, CBS Chief Executive Leslie Moonves said on CNBC. ""This is a very pro-consumer thing, and frankly for Aereo to say that it isn't, you know, is a little bit of sour grapes.""The decision overturned an April 2013 ruling by the federal appeals court in New York, which had denied the broadcasters' request to shut down Aereo while litigation moves forward.The case is American Broadcasting Cos et al, v Aereo Inc, U.S. Supreme Court, No. 13-461.

78,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) LONDON, June 30 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Coventry Building Society's  (CBS, A/Stable/F1) GBP3.2bn mortgages covered bonds at 'AAA' with a Stable  Outlook. KEY RATING DRIVERS The covered bond rating is based on CBS's Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR)  of 'A', an IDR uplift of 0, an unchanged Discontinuity Cap (D-Cap) of 4  (moderate risk) and the 78.4% asset percentage (AP) that Fitch takes into  account in its analysis. The Stable Outlook reflects that on CBS's IDR. The 'AAA' breakeven AP improved to 87% from 85.8%. It is largely driven by  refinancing and reinvestment costs and, to a lesser extent, expected credit  loss. The unstressed weighted average life (WAL) of the assets was 10.7 years,  far longer than the WAL of 2.2 years of the covered bonds outstanding. The 'AAA'  breakeven AP is less conservative than the 85.8% calculated in 2013 due to the  use of lower refinancing spread. The 'AAA' credit loss was largely similar to  2013's due to a fairly stable pool composition. The unchanged D-Cap of 4 is driven by liquidity gap & systemic risk and systemic  alternative management, which Fitch assesses as moderate. The programme has a  reserve fund, which covers a three-month interest and senior fees, and the five  outstanding covered bonds all have a 12-month extendable maturity. Fitch takes into account the contractual AP used in the asset coverage test at  78.4%, which supports a 'AA+' rating on the covered bonds on a probability of  default basis. The contractual AP is sufficient to achieve recoveries in excess  of 91% should the covered bonds default, which support the covered bonds' rating  at 'AAA'.   RATING SENSITIVITIES The 'AAA' rating would be vulnerable to downgrade if any of the following  occurs: (i) the IDR of CBS is downgraded by two or more notches to 'BBB+' or  below; or (ii) the number of notches represented by the IDR uplift and the D-Cap  is reduced to 2 or lower; or (iii) the AP that Fitch considers in its analysis  increases above Fitch's 'AAA' breakeven level of 87%.  The Fitch breakeven AP for the covered bond rating will be affected, amongst  others, by the profile of the cover assets relative to outstanding covered  bonds, which can change over time, even in the absence of new issuance.  Therefore the breakeven AP to maintain the covered bond rating cannot be assumed  to remain stable over time.  More details on the portfolio and Fitch's analysis will be available in a full  rating report, which will shortly be available at www.fitchratings.com.

82,"  (Repeat for additional subscribers)July 11 (The following statement was released by the rating agency)Fitch Ratings, London, 11 July 2014: Fitch Ratings has affirmed Coventry Building Society's  (CBS, A/Stable/F1) GBP3.2bn mortgages covered bonds at 'AAA' with a Stable Outlook and increased the Issuer Default Rating (IDR) uplift for the programme to 1 from zero.KEY RATING DRIVERS The covered bond rating is based on CBS's Long-term IDR of 'A', an IDR uplift of  1, an unchanged Discontinuity Cap (D-Cap) of 4 (moderate risk) and the 87% asset  percentage (AP) that Fitch takes into account in its analysis, which is  equivalent to the 'AAA' breakeven AP at 87%. The Stable Outlook reflects that on  CBS's IDR. The IDR uplift of 1 reflects an increase in CBS's senior unsecured debt to total  adjusted assets to over 5%, which is the threshold defined under Fitch's  criteria. This provides a buffer for covered bondholders should equity and  junior instruments prove insufficient to absorb losses. Fitch views that the  senior unsecured debt-to-total adjusted assets ratio will remain at over 5% in  the medium term given CBS's accessibility to wholesale funding and CBS's  recognition of the diversification benefit of wholesale funding. However, Fitch  is also of the view that it may be easier to liquidate CBS over resolution by  other methods due to its small size and that the UK is not deemed by Fitch as a  covered bond-intensive jurisdiction. Therefore the IDR uplift is limited to only  one notch.The 'AAA' breakeven AP is largely driven by refinancing and reinvestment costs  as a result of a material mismatch of the weighted average life between the  cover pool and covered bonds, and by, to a lesser extent, 'AAA' expected credit  loss. The unchanged D-Cap of 4 is driven by liquidity gap & systemic risk and systemic  alternative management, which Fitch assesses as moderate. The programme has a  reserve fund, which covers up to three months of interest and senior fees, and  all the five outstanding covered bonds have a 12-month extendable maturity. Fitch takes into account the contractual AP in the asset coverage test which  supports a 'AA' rating on the covered bonds on a probability of default basis.The contractual AP is also sufficient to achieve recoveries in excess of 91%  should the covered bonds default, supporting a two-notch uplift to 'AAA'. RATING SENSITIVITIES The 'AAA' rating would be vulnerable to downgrade if any of the following  occurs: (i) the IDR of CBS is downgraded by three or more notches to 'BBB' or  below; or (ii) the combined notches represented by the IDR uplift and the D-Cap  is reduced to three or less; or (iii) the AP that Fitch considers in its  analysis increases above Fitch's 'AAA' breakeven level of 87%.The Fitch breakeven AP for the covered bond rating will be affected, among  others, by the profile of the cover assets relative to outstanding covered  bonds, which can change over time, even in the absence of new issuance.  Therefore the breakeven AP to maintain the covered bond rating cannot be assumed  to remain stable over time.More details on the portfolio and Fitch's analysis will be available in a full  rating report, which will shortly be available at www.fitchratings.com.",2014-07-11,CBS,"Fri Jul 11, 2014 | 7:26am EDT",RPT-Fitch Affirms Coventry Building Society's Mortgage CVBs at 'AAA'; Increases IDR Uplift to 1,http://www.reuters.com//article/fitch-affirms-coventry-building-societys-idUSFit70865220140711?type=companyNews

86,"  (Adds quotes from Oyster exec, background)By Deepa SeetharamanNEW YORK, July 18 Amazon.com Inc  launched a $9.99-per-month subscription service on Friday that lets customers read as much as they choose from its library of more than 600,000 digital books.Subscribers to the Kindle Unlimited service can read e-books, including ""The Hunger Games"" and ""Life of Pi,"" on Amazon's Kindle e-reader or any device with a Kindle app. Subscribers also have access to thousands of audio books.The launch of Kindle Unlimited comes as Amazon remains mired in a months-long contract dispute with the No. 4 U.S. publisher Hachette Book Group, owned by France's Lagardere, over how to price e-books. Amazon is also in talks about digital book pricing with Simon & Schuster, owned by CBS Corp. Amazon's move to offer the Kindle Unlimited service reflects consumers' growing preference toward subscription-based models for consuming digital media, such as Netflix Inc for movies and television shows and Spotify for music.The new Amazon service will compete with others in the market, including Oyster, which charges $9.95 per month for unlimited access to more than 500,000 titles.In an interview, Oyster's co-founder Eric Stromberg said he was not surprised by Amazon's move but that his company's partnership with major publishers gave Oyster a higher-quality catalog. ""They've tried to pivot from transaction to subscription-based in other forms of media - music, movies, kids' books - and had limited success,"" Stromberg said of Amazon.""Through our partnerships with Harper Collins and Simon & Schuster, two of the largest publishers in the world, we're able to deliver to our audience a vast and deep catalog of the best books in the world,"" he said. Amazon, which drove the growth of e-books after launching the Kindle in 2007, has branched out into other forms of digital content in recent years. It offers streaming video and music for members of its Prime program and is developing original content.Unlike its other streaming services, Amazon does not require Kindle Unlimited users to be Prime members, who pay $99 a year for free two-day shipping in addition to content.The combative negotiations between Amazon and Hachette have set the publishing world on edge. Earlier this year, Amazon delayed delivery of some Hachette titles, including sought-after print versions and, at one point, it removed a pre-order option for ""The Silkworm,"" by Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling writing as Robert Galbraith.Hachette authors James Patterson, Malcolm Gladwell and Stephen Colbert have openly criticized Amazon for its tactics. Amazon responded by saying its goal was to maintain low prices and a high level of service for its customers.

About 1.5 percent of CBS' billboard are digital, about the same percentage as Van Wagner's, and make up about 10 percent of CBS' billboard revenue. Reuters reported exclusively last week that Van Wagner was exploring a sale that could fetch more than $600 million, and that CBS Outdoor was one of the companies interested in buying the assets. The deal is subject to regulatory review and expected to close early next year. It will be immediately add to adjusted funds from operations per share in the mid-single-digit range in percentage terms, Male added.

92,"  (For more Reuters DEALTALKS, double click on )By Liana B. Baker, Jennifer Saba and Soyoung KimNEW YORK, July 25 If Twenty-First Century Fox  succeeds in buying Time Warner Inc, it's likely to sell CNN and pay billions of dollars in taxes rather than go through the headaches of spinning the cable news channel off to shareholders of the merged company, according to people familiar with the matter.Fox plans to get rid of CNN because it already operates its own namesake news network and would likely face opposition from regulators even if it wanted to keep it. Potential buyers include CBS and Walt Disney's ABC - two broadcast news juggernauts in search of a cable news outlet.A sale would mean a tax hit of about 40 percent of the proceeds, which could range between $6 billion and $10 billion, according to tax experts and industry analysts. The entire sale price would be taxable because CNN is carried on Time Warner's books at near-zero, people familiar with the company said.""That's an additional cost to the deal and that tax liability is going to reduce the amount they are able to pay to Time Warner shareholders,"" said corporate tax and accounting analyst Robert Willens, referring to Fox. The 40 percent figure comes from a combination of federal, state and local taxes, Willens said.Fox isn't considering spinning off CNN, a structure that's popular with media companies when there is a dearth of buyers, according to people familiar with the matter. Time Warner recently cleaved off its magazine division Time Inc as a standalone public company after a possible merger with Meredith Corp fell through. Tribune Co also plans to spin off its newspaper assets from its faster-growing broadcast division next month.Fox would likely face tax consequences in a spin-off as well, a person familiar with the situation said.CNN would have difficulties as a standalone company because, unwound from a cable bundle, it would likely see its subscriber fees plummet, according to people familiar with the matter. CNN makes money from advertising sales and by charging cable companies to carry the channel.It's currently packaged with other Turner channels such as TBS and TNT. The average price cable operators pay CNN has been steadily climbing from 50 cents per subscriber per month in 2009 to 63 cents in 2014, according to estimates from SNL Kagan. Fox itself estimates that CNN would fetch about $6 billion to $7 billion in a sale, according to a person familiar with the matter. That would represent a low double-digit multiple of CNN's estimated annual earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of roughly $500 million, the person added.At those prices, Rupert Murdoch's media colossus would still reap about $3.5 billion to $5 billion after paying the tax bill.Many media assets have a low tax basis, and in CNN's case, its value has increased dramatically from when it was first acquired. In these cases, the seller is taxed on the proceeds of the gains in value.Time Warner got CNN as part of its $7.5 billion acquisition of Turner Broadcasting in 1996, a deal that included the Cartoon Network, the Atlanta Braves baseball team and other properties. Founded in 1980 by media mogul Ted Turner, CNN was the first cable news network in the United States and now has more than 40 news bureaus across the globe, with distribution in more than 200 countries.Representatives from Time Warner and Fox declined to comment.DISCIPLINE The idea to divest CNN was part of Fox's offer that Time Warner rebuffed worth $85 per share in a mix of cash and stock, which both companies disclosed on July 16. Sources told Reuters last week that Time Warner's board was concerned about the structure of the deal because the stock that Fox had on the table was only common shares, not the special class of voting stock that gives Murdoch control.To make a deal more appealing to Time Warner's board, Fox will have to come up with a significantly higher amount of cash, people familiar with Time Warner have suggested.While it remains to be seen how much more Murdoch is willing to put on the table eventually, one person said Fox currently is not considering a bid above the $90 to $95 per share range.The relatively high tax hit on CNN may play into that calculus, because it would force Murdoch to look elsewhere for additional funds for any premium.On Friday, Fox announced a deal to sell its European pay-TV assets in Germany and Italy to BSkyB in a deal worth $9 billion. Fox holds a 39 percent stake in British pay-TV channel BSkyB in a deal that will net Fox after-tax proceeds of around $7.2 billion.Some of the cash proceeds could be used to support a potential higher bid for Time Warner, but Fox plans to be prudent in its pursuit and will likely use part of the money toward buying back shares, people familiar with the matter said.Moody's analyst Neil Begley said he sees Fox as having enough financial flexibility to pay down debt over time, which could help it pursue a higher bid without sacrificing the company's investment grade credit rating.""Mr. Murdoch is a smart guy. I'd be very surprised if he's suddenly willing to bet the farm here,"" Begley said.        (Reporting by Liana B. Baker, Soyoung Kim and Jennifer Saba in New York.

When co-host Gayle King started her section of the interview by saying ""So, you were born a boy..."", Cox quickly corrected her by saying that she was ""assigned"" a gender at birth, but she always felt like she was a girl. It seemed that King and her co-anchors, Norah O'Donnell and Charlie Rose, were a bit stuck on Cox being transgender, asking her questions about when she knew she was a girl and many standard queries that any other transgender person has been asked a million times.Cox also spoke about her twin brother, singer M. Lamar, who played the pre-trans version of Cox's ""OITNB"" character, Sophia, in Season 1 flashbacks. ""My brother's the first person to say that 'you're a brilliant actor and you should be acting,'"" she said. And how did M.

94,"   By Jennifer Saba and Soham Chatterjee  Viacom Inc, the owner of cable networks MTV and Comedy Central and movie studio Paramount Pictures, on Wednesday posted lower-than-expected second-quarter revenue as it released fewer movies.The release in late June of the latest ""Transformers"" movie, which has since reached blockbuster status, came too late in the quarter to save Viacom's filmed entertainment unit from a decline in revenue; the unit's revenue fell 26 percent.The 7 percent fall in quarterly total revenue, to $3.4 billion, also reflected continuing weakness in domestic advertising revenue at Viacom's cable networks.Philippe Dauman, chief executive of Viacom, said on a call with analysts that certain automotive and consumer good makers pulled back on their ad spend during the upfronts - the annual spring event hosted by media companies to court Madison Avenue to make advance commitments for most of their television ad budgets.Domestic advertising revenue at Viacom's cable networks rose 1 percent, below many analysts' forecasts.""We do believe that some of the dollars that were withheld in the general upfront market will be coming back,"" Dauman said. On Wednesday, Time Warner said that advertising revenue at Turner, its cable network division, was up 1 percent. The lackluster ad results at both media conglomerates could point to a broader downward trend as consumers shift the way they watch TV and advertisers put more dollars toward digital buys.Shares of Viacom were down 1 percent at $80.90 in afternoon trade on Wednesday. Filmed entertainment revenue was hurt by a 43 percent fall in theatrical revenue due to the number and timing of movie releases, Viacom said.This week, ""Transformers: Age of Extinction"" became the first movie released this year to earn more than $1 billion in global box office returns, according to Paramount Pictures.Viacom said operating profit at its cable networks business fell 3 percent as it earned less from certain distribution deals and spent more on programming.

95,"  (Adds executive comment, bylines)By Jennifer Saba and Soham ChatterjeeAug 6 Viacom Inc, the owner of cable networks MTV and Comedy Central and movie studio Paramount Pictures, on Wednesday posted lower-than-expected second-quarter revenue as it released fewer movies.The release in late June of the latest ""Transformers"" movie, which has since reached blockbuster status, came too late in the quarter to save Viacom's filmed entertainment unit from a decline in revenue; the unit's revenue fell 26 percent.The 7 percent fall in quarterly total revenue, to $3.4 billion, also reflected continuing weakness in domestic advertising revenue at Viacom's cable networks.Philippe Dauman, chief executive of Viacom, said on a call with analysts that certain automotive and consumer good makers pulled back on their ad spend during the upfronts - the annual spring event hosted by media companies to court Madison Avenue to make advance commitments for most of their television ad budgets.Domestic advertising revenue at Viacom's cable networks rose 1 percent, below many analysts' forecasts. ""We do believe that some of the dollars that were withheld in the general upfront market will be coming back,"" Dauman said.On Wednesday, Time Warner said that advertising revenue at Turner, its cable network division, was up 1 percent.The lackluster ad results at both media conglomerates could point to a broader downward trend as consumers shift the way they watch TV and advertisers put more dollars toward digital buys. Shares of Viacom were down 1 percent at $80.90 in afternoon trade on Wednesday.Filmed entertainment revenue was hurt by a 43 percent fall in theatrical revenue due to the number and timing of movie releases, Viacom said.This week, ""Transformers: Age of Extinction"" became the first movie released this year to earn more than $1 billion in global box office returns, according to Paramount Pictures. Viacom said operating profit at its cable networks business fell 3 percent as it earned less from certain distribution deals and spent more on programming.Net income from continuing operations attributable to Viacom fell to $611 million, or $1.40 per share, from $647 million, or $1.32 per share, a year earlier.Excluding items, the company earned $1.42 per share.Analysts on average expected an adjusted profit of $1.43 per share on revenue of $3.66 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.(Reporting by Soham Chatterjee in Bangalore; Editing by Simon Jennings and Leslie Adler)",2014-08-06,CBS,"Wed Aug 6, 2014 | 2:52pm EDT",UPDATE 2-Viacom revenue misses estimates on fewer movie releases,http://www.reuters.com//article/viacom-results-idUSL4N0QC42C20140806?type=companyNews

The company, which released the latest installment of its hit ""Transformers"" series late in the quarter, said theatrical revenue fell 43 percent due to the number and timing of movie releases. Net income from continuing operations attributable to Viacom fell to $611 million, or $1.40 per share, from $647 million, or $1.32 per share, a year earlier.

97,"  Media company CBS Corp (CBS.N), owner of the most-watched U.S. television network, reported a quarterly profit that beat Wall Street forecasts on Thursday, though weaker advertising and a decline in television licensing dragged on revenue.CBS posted adjusted earnings-per-share of 78 cents for the second quarter, beating the average forecast of 71 cents by analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net earnings from continuing operations fell to $418 million from $435 million a year earlier. The company, which operates the CBS broadcast network and premium cable channel Showtime, also raised its share repurchase program to $6 billion from $3 billion and increased its quarterly dividend to 15 cents per share from 12 cents.In its earnings report, CBS said this year's absence of the NCAA men's college basketball semifinals and ""softness"" in the second quarter ad market contributed to lower revenue. Total revenue fell 5.3 percent to $3.19 billion, falling short of the average analyst estimate of $3.24 billion.CBS, which airs hit shows such as ""The Big Bang Theory"" and ""NCIS,"" said advertising revenue dropped 7 percent from a year earlier. Revenue from content licensing and distribution declined 9.4 percent, partly due to the timing of international sales, the company said. CBS Chief Executive Leslie Moonves said the pace of ad sales was improving ""significantly"" in the third quarter and he expected the fourth quarter to be even stronger. CBS will benefit, he said, from demand for advertising during its new broadcasts of Thursday night National Football League games this fall and political advertising ahead of the November mid-term elections. Moonves, speaking to analysts on a conference call, also said more advertisers had agreed to pay for ads viewed within seven days after an episode airs on television, a measurement known as C7, rather than three days. He predicted that more than 75 percent of deals by next year's ""upfront"" selling season in the spring - when advertising spending is committed in advance of the new television season - would be based on the C7 measurement. CBS considered the idea of making a bid for the CNN cable news network if it had been sold as part of a Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA.O) purchase of Time Warner Inc (TWX.N), Moonves said. The idea is ""irrelevant"" now that Fox has walked away from its pursuit of Time Warner, he said.""We are pretty happy with our assets right now, and I doubt we would look to do anything with something like that,"" Moonves said. Chief Operating Officer Joseph Ianniello said CBS ""will continue to be very disciplined in our approach to M&A.""CBS shares were little changed in extended trading. Before the earnings release, CBS shares closed down 1.3 percent at $56.90 on the New York Stock Exchange.

100,"  Oscar-winning actor and comedian Robin Williams was found dead on Monday from an apparent suicide at his home in Northern California, Marin County Sheriff's Office said. He was 63.The sheriff's coroner's division said it suspects the death was a suicide due to asphyxia, but the cause of death is still under investigation.""This morning, I lost my husband and my best friend, while the world lost one of its most beloved artists and beautiful human beings. I am utterly heartbroken,"" Williams's wife Susan Schneider said in a statement.Williams, who won an Academy Award for his role as a fatherly therapist in 1997's ""Good Will Hunting,"" had been suffering from severe depression recently, his publicist Mara Buxbaum said. Williams, who introduced his frenetic style on late 1970s TV series ""Mork & Mindy"" and had struggled with addiction in the past, had entered a Minnesota rehabilitation center last month to help him maintain sobriety.His representatives at the time said Williams was not using drugs or alcohol but had gone to the center to ""fine-tune and focus"" his sobriety after working a longer-than-usual schedule. The Marin County Sheriff's office said it received an emergency call about noon local time on Monday, saying that Williams was unconscious and not breathing at his home near Tiburon, north of San Francisco. Fellow comedic actor Steve Martin said in a tweet: ""I could not be more stunned by the loss of Robin Williams, mensch, great talent, acting partner, genuine soul.""

101,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, August 11 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'BBB' rating to CBS  Corporation's (CBS) proposed issuance of benchmark-sized senior unsecured notes.  The proceeds from the offering are expected to fund the company's offer to  purchase four tranches of senior notes with approximately $2.1 billion of  aggregate principal outstanding pursuant to the all-cash tender offer launched  today and general corporate purpose including the repayment of commercial paper  (CP) or other indebtedness.   Fitch currently has a 'BBB' Issuer Default Rating (IDR) for CBS. The Rating  Outlook for the IDR, as well as all of CBS' ratings is Stable.  A full list of  ratings follows at the end of this release. CBS had approximately $6.2 billion  of debt outstanding (including $381 million of CP) as of June 30, 2014.  The notes will rank pari passu with all other unsecured and unsubordinated  indebtedness of CBS and will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed by CBS  Operations Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of CBS that directly or indirectly  owns Showtime Networks, Simon & Schuster, CBS Television Studios, 10 of the  company's 29 full-power broadcast television stations, and the partnership  interest in The CW Network.  CBS will issue the senior notes under the amended  and restated indenture dated as of Nov. 3, 2008 and first supplemental indenture  dated as of April 5, 2010.  Terms as proposed are similar to those of previously issued notes, including i)  a limitation on liens of up to 15% of total consolidated assets (excluding  standard carve-outs); ii) the ability to sell or convey assets that generate  less than 80% of total consolidated revenues; and iii) an obligation of CBS to  make an offer to repurchase the notes at 101% upon change of control (as defined  in the indenture) and non-investment-grade ratings, as defined. Similar to  existing bonds, there are no financial covenants. There is no coupon step-up  provision in this issuance. KEY RATING DRIVERS --CBS' 2.5x leverage target provides the company sufficient flexibility relative  to Fitch's 2.75x gross leverage target for the current ratings;  --Fitch anticipates that CBS will maintain a rational approach to managing its  balance sheet and gradually increase leverage to its target while preserving the  historically conservative financial policy of its capital structure in the  context of capital allocation strategy and participating in merger and  acquisition activity; --The business risks inherent in CBS' operating profile along with Fitch's  expectation that the company will maintain a conservative financial policy  strongly position its credit profile within the current rating category; --CBS' capital allocation strategy which continues to favor shareholder returns  is incorporated into the ratings; --Shareholder returns that exceed free cash flow (FCF) generation are  incorporated into the current ratings to the extent that leverage remains below  Fitch's 2.75x total leverage threshold; --Growing content licensing and distribution, affiliate and subscription  revenues are improving CBS' revenue mix and are in line with the company's  long-term objective to increase non-advertising revenue sources to 50% of total  revenues. CBS' credit profile is strongly positioned within its ratings category providing  the company with a material level of financial flexibility to accommodate the  modest increase in leverage resulting from the split-off of CBS Outdoor  Americas, Inc. Fitch expects the issuance taken together with the all-cash  tender offer will be executed in a leverage-neutral manner and will contribute  to stronger interest coverage.  Fitch estimates consolidated leverage, pro forma  for the split-off of CBS Outdoor Americas (completed on July 16, 2014) was 1.9x  as of the LTM period ended June 30, 2014, which was in line with the company's  pro forma leverage as of year-end 2013.  Share repurchases continue to be the centerpiece of CBS' capital allocation  strategy and the primary tool the company will utilize to achieve its leverage  target. Shareholder returns that exceed FCF generation are incorporated into the  current ratings to the extent that leverage remains below Fitch's 2.75x total  leverage threshold. With annual FCF (defined as cash flow from operations less  capital expenditures and dividends) expected to range between $1.3 billion and  $1.4 billion, the company has material flexibility within the current ratings to  accommodate its capital allocation policy.  CBS is on track to return approximately $6 billion of capital to its  shareholders during 2014. This includes $1.5 billion from the company's  accelerated share repurchase program completed during the first quarter of 2014,  $1.2 billion of anticipated regular share repurchases, common dividends and the  exchange of CBS' stake in CBS Outdoor Americas that will be included in the  shareholder-return calculation for 2014 (valued at $2.7 billion based on the CBS  stock price on the expiration date of the exchange).  CBS expects its retransmission consent/reverse compensation revenue will grow to  $1 billion by 2017 and to $2 billion by 2020 as these revenue streams are among  CBS' fastest growing revenue segments. Fitch believes that the combination of  escalators built into existing agreements and anticipated rate increases in new  deals that will be executed firmly place CBS on a path to achieve its revenue  goals. Growing retransmission and reverse compensation revenues is in line with  CBS' operating strategy as these revenues provide the company with a stable and  recurring element of its revenue base which mitigates some of the volatility  associated with advertising revenues. Obtaining its revenue objectives largely  depends on CBS' ability to maintain strong network ratings and retain its  valuable sports programming rights portfolio including its rights to the NFL.  CBS' ratings reflect the strong competitive position of the CBS television  network and studio as well as largely stable demand for CBS' various advertising  platforms. The broadcast network, owing to its ratings strength, is  well-positioned to capture large viewing audiences amid an increasingly  fractured media landscape. Fitch believes that demand for the television  studio's content remains strong across all major end markets.  In Fitch's view, split-off of CBS Outdoor Americas is in line with CBS' overall  strategy to become a content-centric business, grow non-advertising revenues,  and create a revenue base that is more stable and recurring. The transaction  will reduces CBS' exposure to cyclical advertising revenues as well. Fitch's ratings for CBS continue to be supported by a strong television and  radio station presence in the top 25 U.S. markets, leading positions in  first-run syndication, a robust library and pipeline of off-network syndicated  programming, and an increasing portion of carriage and re-transmission revenues.  Re-transmission fees, and increasingly, reverse network compensation, remain a  small portion of overall revenues but will make an increasingly meaningful  contribution to operating profits, as they are stable, recurring and have high  incremental margins. Rating concerns include an above-average exposure to cyclical advertising  revenue and the company's capacity to adapt to ever-changing media consumption  patterns and technology platforms. Additional concerns center on the company's  ability to balance escalating programming expense and production costs with the  requirement to consistently deliver programs that drive incremental share of an  increasingly fragmented viewing audience while maintaining or expanding  operating margins.  CBS' liquidity position is strong and supported by $261 million of cash on hand  as of June 30, 2014, $2 billion in available credit facilities (nearly all of  which was available as of March 31, 2014), and expected FCF generation. CBS'  revolver commitment expires on March 15, 2018. Scheduled maturities are  well-laddered and manageable considering expected FCF generation, reliable  market access and backup liquidity. Approximately 31% of the company's debt  outstanding as of June 30, 2014 is scheduled to mature over the next five years,  including $381 million of CP outstanding as of June 30, 2014, $200 million  during 2016 and $400 million in 2017. RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive rating action would likely coincide with CBS adopting a more  conservative financial policy highlighted by a gross leverage target of 2.25x or  lower. Moreover, Fitch needs to observe meaningful progress in CBS' efforts to  transform its revenue mix and reduce its reliance on cyclical advertising  revenues. Meanwhile CBS will need to demonstrate that its operating profile can  sustain itself amid ongoing competitive pressures, changing media consumption  patterns and evolving technology platforms.  Negative rating actions are more likely to coincide with discretional actions of  CBS management including, but not limited to, adopting a more aggressive  financial strategy or event-driven merger and acquisition activity that drive  leverage beyond 3.5x in the absence of a credible de-leveraging plan.  Additionally, negative rating actions could result should Fitch begin to observe  a negative impact from alternative content distribution platforms and other  forms of entertainment that is significantly larger than Fitch's expectations,  or a weakening of the company's television studio's ability to produce desired  television content, or secure programming on its television networks that  consistently delivers the viewing audience and related advertising revenues. Fitch currently rates CBS as follows: CBS Corporation (CBS) --Long-term IDR 'BBB'; --Senior unsecured 'BBB'; --Short-term IDR 'F2';  --CP 'F2'.

He was suspended from a belt wedged between a closet door and a door frame, in a seated position just off the ground, Marin County's assistant chief deputy coroner, Keith Boyd, told a news conference.""Mr. Williams' personal assistant became concerned at approximately 11:45 a.m. when he failed to respond to knocks on his bedroom door,"" said Boyd.   ""His right shoulder area was touching the door with his body perpendicular to the door and slightly suspended.

It was not yet known if it was his blood.Williams had been open about his struggles with alcohol and cocaine and in the past months had entered a rehabilitation center to help him maintain sobriety. But many questions remained over what could have led him to take his own life. Williams' publicist, Mara Buxbaum, said on Monday that he had been suffering from severe depression, and Boyd acknowledged that he had been seeking treatment without giving more details.His tragic end stood in stark contrast to the many on-screen characters he portrayed who encouraged those around them to tap into their own inner vitality, a wellspring of creativity to which he himself gave full vent in films such as ""Good Morning, Vietnam"" and ""Dead Poets Society.""

104,"  (Corrects spelling of ""censor"" from ""sensor"" in paragraph 11)By Piya Sinha-RoyLOS ANGELES Aug 21 When ABC's ""Modern Family"" vies for its fifth consecutive best comedy Emmy award on Monday, not only will it battle the beloved geeks of CBS' ""The Big Bang Theory"" but also a bunch of irreverent, foul-mouthed characters from cable and Netflix.For the first time in Emmy history, networks are outnumbered by cable and online streaming outlets in the coveted best comedy series category, a sign of a growing appetite for comedy free from the confines of network TV.""Modern Family"" made waves when its contemporary family dynamic and gay couple appeared on Walt Disney Co's ABC in 2010. But today, along with CBS Corp's ""The Big Bang Theory,"" it would be considered a safe choice for Emmy voters.The network stalwarts are joined by two previous cable nominees: the dark and sometimes melancholy comedy ""Louie"" on Twenty-First Century Fox's basic cable FX, and HBO's ""Veep,"" a political satire rich with curse words from U.S. Vice President Selina Meyer.And then there are the newcomers, like HBO's technology satire, ""Silicon Valley,"" where startup culture gets a dose of gross-out humor. ""In order to get people to love a show, you need to alienate some people, whereas network shows in general have a business model where they have to go for the middle,"" said Alec Berg, executive producer and writer for ""Silicon Valley,"" nominated in its first season.""They need to get the most people, but unfortunately that costs you the people who are super passionate.""The other new kid in the comedy race is ""Orange Is the New Black,"" the darling of Netflix's original summer programming. The series is based on a real-life story about a women's prison, with situations that often stray far from laughs.To date, HBO's sexually explicit female-driven ""Sex and the City,"" which won the best comedy Emmy in 2002, is the only cable show to do so. A FRESH 'ORANGE' Much of the difference between a broadcast network comedy and a cable show comes down to advertiser interests, which networks must cater to, but premium cable channels such as HBO and ad-free streaming platform Netflix can avoid. This leads to content that pushes the boundaries, said Berg. ""People are getting more used to watching things in places where there are no FCC (Federal Communications Commission) guidelines, there are no censors and there are no standards and practices people sitting around,"" Berg said. ""Those (guidelines) are starting to feel very antiquated.""For Netflix, which entered the Emmy race just last year and has a total of 31 nominations this year, ""Orange"" may just be its ""Sex and the City,"" after scooping up 12 nods.""'Orange' has the dramatic element, it has the feel of its time and it has a strong ensemble of women,"" said Glenn Whipp, awards columnist for the Los Angeles Times. ""It feels fresh.""""Orange"" may also have benefited from the buzz surrounding its second season release in June, which coincided with the Emmy voting period.But ""Modern Family"" still holds its place as a frontrunner for many awards predictors, who believe the ABC show will win its fifth best comedy Emmy on Monday as it continues to reflect contemporary family dynamics and featured a gay wedding in its latest season. Whipp said traditionally, Emmy voters tend to select more conservative choices within the comedy field.""The show is just going to be hugely appealing to voters because it makes a social statement, but it is done in an audience-friendly way,"" said Whipp. ""It is both a critical and a commercial, popular success.""

105,"  SAN RAFAEL Calif. Comedian Robin Williams' ashes have been scattered in the San Francisco Bay following his apparent suicide, according to a death certificate released by Marin County on Thursday.Williams, 63, was found hanged in his Tiburon, California, home last week. The ""Mrs. Doubtfire"" star had been suffering from severe depression, anxiety and early Parkinson's disease before his death.Williams' cremated remains were released on Aug. 12, the day after his death, according to the document.Williams' death stunned his former Hollywood colleagues, who remembered him for his generosity and humble nature. The actor's madcap comic style launched him to prominence as a friendly alien in the late 1970s TV series ""Mork & Mindy,"" and his dramatic versatility also earned him an Oscar for his role as a fatherly therapist in 1997's ""Good Will Hunting.""Williams' family has not announced plans for a memorial. Fellow comedian Billy Crystal will give a tribute to Williams at the annual television Emmy Awards on Aug. 25.

106,"  (Adds details of show, reviews)By Piya Sinha-RoyLOS ANGELES Aug 26 After moving up a month and switching to a weekday evening, Monday's Primetime Emmy awards drew 15.6 million viewers, a drop from last year's Sunday night show despite a new host, a passionate kiss and a touching tribute.This year's Emmy awards, which saw AMC's drug drama ""Breaking Bad"" and ABC's hit ""Modern Family"" take home the top awards in drama and comedy, drew the second-highest viewership in the past eight years, NBC said on Tuesday, citing Nielsen ratings figures.The show, which was also moved a month earlier to August, drew 5.3 million viewers in the 18-to-49 demographic coveted by advertisers. On social media, Emmys were a top trending topic on Twitter throughout the telecast, while 6.2 million people discussed the show on Facebook.Key moments from the night included ""Veep"" winner Julia Louis-Dreyfus locking lips with Bryan Cranston for a passionate kiss as a throwback to their ""Seinfeld"" days as she went up to collect her best comedy actress award, and an audience question-and-answer session with Melissa McCarthy asking whether her illegally parked car would get towed.The show also featured Billy Crystal's touching and funny tribute to the late Robin Williams. Comcast Corp's NBC said the Emmys telecast beat rival broadcast networks in the 8 p.m.-to-11 p.m. time period, with CBS Corp's CBS, Twenty-First Century Fox Inc's  FOX and Walt Disney Co's ABC drawing a combined total of 13.8 million viewers on Monday.Last year's show, which took place on a Sunday in September and was hosted by Neil Patrick Harris on CBS, drew 17.6 million viewers. Critics this year picked on the complicated awards show categories, which saw some confusing entries such as HBO's ""True Detective"" in best drama rather than miniseries, and Netflix's ""Orange Is the New Black"" drama about a women's prison submitted in the best comedy category.The controversy served first-time Emmy host Seth Meyers well in his opening monologue as he joked about trying to submitting his ""Late Night"" show as a miniseries, but critics were left torn by the night's events.Alessandra Stanley at the New York Times said Meyers ""was charming, but he didn't take many risks, and overall, the ceremony was a brisk, rather tame event.""Tim Goodman at the Hollywood Reporter said the ""head-scratching awards show"" delivered winners ""all over the map,"" but praised Meyers for being ""affable and steady and kept the banter light and upbeat.""

108,"  * Japan CB issuance through August nearly double year-ago period* Most CBs issued with 20-40 pct premium to current stock price* Companies include conditions to offset dilution risksBy Lisa TwaroniteTOKYO, Aug 29 Convertible bond issuance by Japanese companies in 2014 nearly doubled from the previous period, and is on track for a banner year as firms tap a cheap source of funding and a pause in Japan's recent stock market rally reduces conversion risks.Japanese firms issued about $5.0 billion worth of convertible bonds in the year through August, compared with $2.6 billion issued in the same period a year ago, according to Thomson Reuters data which showed issuance hit an eight-year peak in the first half of 2014.A convertible bond has an embedded option to convert to a company's shares at a fixed conversion price. The hybrid fixed-income/equity instrument allows companies to raise funds without some of the disadvantages of either a straight bond or a standard share offering. A zero-coupon CB will not increase a company's debt burden, and high conversion premiums reduce the chances that a company's shares will take a hit.Most CBs are issued at a 20 to 40 percent premium to the level where the stock price is currently trading, according to Tokyo bankers.In 2013, the Nikkei stock average surged more than 56 percent, riding hopes for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's ambitious programme to beat deflation and spark sustainable growth. But so far, the Nikkei has given back about 5 percent this year, after an April hike in the national sales tax dragged down consumption. Japanese CBs carry a zero coupon, meaning a company faces no debt servicing costs as it would if it issued a straight bond. CBs also allow issuers to sidestep the immediate share dilution of a straight stock offering.""Practically, you're issuing at a premium from the current market price. If you do a public offering, it's diluted right away, but with a CB, investors don't convert into shares right away, so the impact to the stock price is light compared to POs,"" said Shaw Kitahara, director at Daiwa Securities in Tokyo.""Of course, no matter how high the conversion premium is, there is no guarantee that the CB will not be converted. There's always a chance,"" Kitahara added. Therefore, some Japanese companies include clauses in their CBs spelling out further conditions to blunt any potential impact on their stock price.Some CBs, including those issued in May by Toray Industries  and Yamada Denki, contain net-share settlement clauses. If the company's stock price at the bond's maturity is above the conversion price, it can repay the principal amount in cash instead of shares, and only give investors shares for the value above the conversion price.Such issues usually have an upside ""contingent convertible"" or ""coco"" clause, making conversion ""contingent"" on set conditions, such as the share price exceeding a fixed level for a specified time.Moreover, some companies, including Toray and Yamada Denki, which each issued 100 billion yen worth of CBs, used some of the funds they raised to buy back their own shares, which supported their share price in the near term. ""The idea of dilution down the road - who cares? If the stock price goes up by that much, then the company's doing something well,"" said Chris McGuire, chief executive and chief investment officer of Chicago-based Phalanx Capital Management, a fund primarily focused on Japanese convertible bond arbitrage and holds about $1 billion of the instruments.""If the shares don't go up, the company just pays back the money, after not paying any interest on it. They've just received a free loan,"" he said.McGuire estimates there are about $40 or 50 billion of Japanese convertibles outstanding, roughly 10 percent of the global supply of the instruments.He typically sells away the fixed-income portion of the convertible through an asset swap, and keeps the equity option.""Even though it's zero-coupon, based on the credit worthiness of the company, we can sell away the fixed income to a counterparty, who then will sell us back an option,"" said McGuire. ""A Japanese pension fund, or trust fund, or regional bank that wants yield is happy to buy it.""(1 US dollar = 103.7800 Japanese yen)   (Reporting by Lisa Twaronite; Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore)",2014-08-29,CBS,"Fri Aug 29, 2014 | 1:16am EDT",Japanese companies turn to convertible bonds for funding,http://www.reuters.com//article/japan-markets-convertibles-idUSL4N0QS27I20140829?type=companyNews

121,"   By Lehar Maan  If you can't fight 'em, join 'em.CBS Corp launched digital video-on-demand and live-streaming services on Thursday, aiming to win back viewers who are increasingly turning to the Internet for entertainment.The launch follows an announcement from Time Warner Inc a day earlier that HBO will be available as a standalone, online streaming service next year. The moves by CBS and HBO put more pressure on online video pioneer Netflix Inc, which said on Wednesday it had signed up fewer video-streaming subscribers than forecast in the third quarter. ""It's an interesting way to tap into some data that probably sits there being unused, not generating any revenues,"" Benchmark Co LLC analyst Edward Atorino said of CBS's plans.""It's no cost, they got the stuff there, they send it down the line. If somebody tunes in, great. If not, the costs are minimal,"" Atorino said, adding that CBS has ""a little more credibility"" than Netflix when it comes to content.""Netflix has either got to buy it or try to produce it. CBS has got a library sitting there 24 hours a day,"" he said. CBS Chief Executive Leslie Moonves said the new service is aimed at ""superfans,"" who want to watch entire series as well as people who prefer watching video on mobile devices.""You go to a college campus, there are no TVs,"" Moonves said in an interview. ""This gives them an opportunity to get access to a lot of our programming in addition to a live linear stream."" The moves by HBO and CBS to go ""over-the-top"" - media jargon meaning people can watch programs with only a broadband connection - could spur more consumers to dump cable television subscriptions.CBS All Access is available for $5.99 per month and can be downloaded on iOS and Android devices.Apart from episodes of 15 primetime shows a day after they air on TV, CBS All Access will offer past seasons of eight current series, including ""The Good Wife,"" ""Blue Blood,"" and ""Survivor,"" as well as such classics as ""Star Trek,"" and ""CSI: Miami."" Live streaming will be available in 14 markets, including New York, Los Angeles and Chicago.Consumers may also be able to get CBS All Access through cable or satellite providers. Moonves said CBS is offering pay TV operators the chance to add the service to the packages they sell to customers. Time Warner and CBS signaled last month that they were open to making HBO and Showtime available directly to consumers over the Internet without a cable subscription. Showtime and HBO both currently offer programs online, but customers have to subscribe to a cable package and pay extra fees for the premium channels.CBS shares rose 0.85 percent to close at $51.18 on the New York Stock Exchange.

122,"   By Lisa Richwine | LOS ANGELES  LOS ANGELES CBS Corp is offering pay television providers the option to add the new CBS All Access streaming service to the packages they sell to consumers, Chief Executive Leslie Moonves said in an interview on Thursday.Earlier on Thursday, CBS launched the digital video-on-demand and live-streaming services in an effort to win viewers who are increasingly turning to the Internet for entertainment. Cable and satellite TV providers can gain access to the service for ""considerably less"" per subscriber than the $5.99 that consumers will pay to sign up for the product directly, Moonves said.""If (pay TV providers) are interested in having the access to all these episodes of all these shows, plus the live linear feed for mobile devices ... they can get it,"" Moonves said. ""We would be very happy to work with them on this and we assume we will,"" he added. The exact price has not been determined, he said. CBS and other media companies are trying to reach consumers on the Internet while maintaining their relationships with traditional pay TV providers, also known as multichannel video programming distributors or MVPDs, that pay lucrative fees for their content. ""Our goal is not to hurt the MVPDs,"" Moonves said. ""We think that business model works very well. We want it to continue to work. We hope they join in on this idea."" CBS All Access will offer episodes of 15 of the network's prime-time shows a day after they air on TV, plus past seasons of eight current series, including ""The Good Wife,"" ""Blue Blood"" and ""Survivor,"" and classics such as ""Star Trek"" and ""CSI: Miami.""

123,"  NEW YORK Oct 19 Shares of CBS Corp  could gain 25 percent in part given their cheap price and the promise of the company's premium cable TV channel Showtime, Barron's financial newspaper said in its latest edition.CBS Shares have fallen about 18 percent this year. The media company reported a second-quarter profit that beat Wall Street forecasts in August, though weaker advertising and a decline in television licensing dragged on revenue. Investor pessimism toward the company's shares is unwarranted and they could easily regain their losses in the coming year, Barron's said in its Oct. 20 issue. CBS is becoming less dependent on ads, and advertising will likely comprise just half of the company's total revenue by next year, it added. (on.barrons.com/1vSrt8A) CBS shares trade at 14 times earnings projections for the next 12 months, below peers such as Walt Disney Co and Twenty-First Century Fox Inc, and would be worth $66 at a multiple similar to them, Barron's said. That marks upside of more than 25 percent from the stock's closing price on Friday of $52.35. Barron's said a direct-to-consumer version of Showtime would be nearly identical to Netflix while offering ""arguably better programming"" and suggested that Showtime could be worth $12 billion. ""(CBS chief executive Les Moonves) says CBS has no interest in a Showtime spinoff, but there's still value to be unlocked. Investors don't even have to go searching for a new station,"" Barron's said.

126,"  (Adds revised revenue forecast from Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S in paragraph 2, updates share price)By Jennifer SabaNEW YORK Oct 23 Comcast Corp reported higher quarterly revenue and income on Thursday as more people signed up for its high-speed Internet service and fewer customers dropped their cable subscriptions.Total revenue at the largest U.S. cable operator, which owns NBC Universal, rose to $16.79 billion in the third quarter, up 4 percent from the year-ago period. Analysts had been expecting $16.83 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Comcast said it added 315,000 net high-speed Internet subscribers, a 5.8 percent uptick over the year-ago period.About 81,000 customers canceled video subscriptions, far fewer than the net loss of 127,000 in the 2013 third quarter. Analysts had forecast a net loss of 93,000 subscribers, according to StreetAccount.Comcast said the number of customers who dropped cable subscriptions was the smallest of any third quarter in seven years. It has a total of 26.8 million customers. Comcast shares were up 3.4 percent at $53.25 in early afternoon trading.The decrease in cable subscriptions is a closely watched figure that has taken on greater import given two major announcements from Time Warner Inc's HBO and CBS Corp  last week.Both the pay TV network and broadcaster are launching services that allow people to watch programs with only a broadband connection. Cable and satellite distributors are seeking ways to stop consumers, especially younger ones, from dumping their cable subscriptions, or ""cutting the cord."" NBC Universal Chief Executive Steve Burke told analysts on Thursday he was surprised by the HBO and CBS news and that both media companies face challenges.He noted the standalone products represent a big strategic  change for Time Warner and CBS. Time Warner has long pushed the notion of ""TV Everywhere"" which allows cable and satellite customers to access content on any device. CBS has touted its ability to receive retransmission fees - money paid by distributors to CBS to carry the network.""The existing customers that are sold through cable and satellite are extremely high-margin,"" Burke said. ""When they go directly to consumers via the Internet, they have got to be very careful with cannibalization."" NBC has a stake in video streaming service Hulu, along with Twenty-First Century Fox and Walt Disney Co.On the media side, Comcast reported that revenue at NBC Universal division inched up 1.2 percent to $5.92 billion on the strength of advertising revenue at broadcast network NBC and its theme parks.Third-quarter net income increased almost 50 percent to $2.59 billion, or 99 cents per share.Adjusted for a one-time tax settlement, earnings per share rose to 73 cents from 65 cents in the year-ago period.Comcast is in the process of acquiring Time Warner Cable , which it had agreed to buy for $45.3 billion earlier this year. Comcast expects the deal to close in early 2015.(Editing by Richard Chang and Matthew Lewis)",2014-10-23,CBS,"Thu Oct 23, 2014 | 1:18pm EDT",UPDATE 2-Fewer customers drop Comcast cable subscriptions,http://www.reuters.com//article/comcast-results-idUSL2N0SI0W320141023?type=companyNews
127,"  Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd is looking to expand its entertainment content offering on its Internet television set-top boxes through deals with studios in the United States, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter. Alibaba Group executives are meeting with content providers, such as Walt Disney Co, Viacom Inc's Paramount Pictures, Time Warner Inc's Warner Bros, Sony Corp and Comcast Corp's Universal. The company is seeking deals that will provide it with the rights to distribute U.S. movies and TV shows in China, or invest in a stake, the report said. (bloom.bg/ZHq6LF)Alibaba executives declined to comment.Alibaba's chairman, billionaire Jack Ma, will be in Los Angeles next week for the WSJDLive technology conference and will be meeting with several media companies in the city, people familiar with the matter told Reuters. Hangzhou-based Alibaba, whose September initial public offering ranked as the world's biggest at $25 billion, is looking to move beyond traditional e-commerce, offering more digital products like films, games and television.Since the beginning of the year, Alibaba has aggressively pushed to sell entertainment content to Chinese consumers through its set-top boxes, which also allow consumers to shop from Alibaba's website.  In July, Alibaba signed a deal with Lions Gate Entertainment Corp, the studio behind the ""Hunger Games"" films, to launch a subscription streaming service in China. (reut.rs/1tdd06f)In March, Alibaba bought a controlling stake in ChinaVision Media Group, a film and television content producer, for $804 million. And in April it bought an 18.5 percent stake in Chinese online video streaming site Youku Tudou Inc in partnership with affiliated private equity company Yunfeng Capital. Alibaba's Ma is among Yunfeng Capital's founders . Alibaba has invested more than $3 billion since March in the entertainment industry.

Hangzhou-based Alibaba, whose September initial public offering ranked as the world's biggest at $25 billion, is looking to move beyond traditional e-commerce, offering more digital products like films, games and television. Since the beginning of the year, Alibaba has aggressively pushed to sell entertainment content to Chinese consumers through its set-top boxes, which also allow consumers to shop from Alibaba's website.In July, Alibaba signed a deal with Lions Gate Entertainment Corp, the studio behind the ""Hunger Games"" films, to launch a subscription streaming service in China. (reut.rs/1tdd06f) In March, Alibaba bought a controlling stake in ChinaVision Media Group, a film and television content producer, for $804 million. And in April it bought an 18.5 percent stake in Chinese online video streaming site Youku Tudou Inc in partnership with affiliated private equity company Yunfeng Capital. Alibaba's Ma is among Yunfeng Capital's founders .Alibaba has invested more than $3 billion since March in the entertainment industry.

129,"  LOS ANGELES With the Emmys and Tonys under his belt and his first Oscars hosting gig lined up, actor Neil Patrick Harris is turning his talents to anchor a new NBC variety show, the Comcast Corp-owned broadcast network said on Monday.Harris, 41, best known as the womanizing Barney Stinson on long-running CBS sitcom ""How I Met Your Mother,"" will host the new primetime series, which will feature live comedy skits, musical numbers, game shows and hidden camera pranks on celebrities, NBC said in a statement.The format of the yet-to-be-titled series is based on the popular British ITV show ""Ant and Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway,"" which has already been adapted in numerous European markets including German and Italian versions. NBC has ordered 10 episodes of the U.S. series from ITV Studios America, which will be filmed in front of a live audience. No air date has been scheduled yet.   The show is the latest on Harris's portfolio after it was announced earlier this month that he would be the host of the 2015 Oscars.The actor recently won a best musical actor Tony award for his Broadway stint in ""Hedwig and the Angry Inch,"" and co-starred in David Fincher's hit thriller film ""Gone Girl."" The new variety series follows NBC's push towards televised event spectaculars, trying to draw people to watch live rather than delayed or on-demand programs.  After the success of its live ""Sound of Music"" event with country singer Carrie Underwood last year, NBC is hoping to draw viewers to this year's ""Peter Pan Live!,"" with actress Allison Williams in the title role.

130,"  (Repeats story issued on Nov 2 for wider distribution, no changes to text)By Ronald Grover  and Jennifer SabaLOS ANGELES/NEW YORK, Nov 2, CBS Corp  and Dish Network Corp are far apart on talks for a new distribution deal, according to a person with knowledge of the negotiations, setting up the possibility that the satellite provider's subscribers could lose access to the most-watched U.S. TV network next month.The current agreement, signed on January 5, 2012, is set to expire in late November, according to the person. The two sides continue to talk.CBS and Dish are at odds over the monthly price per subscriber the satellite operator, which has 14 million subscribers, would pay to carry CBS. According to media consultant SNL Kagan, CBS's TV stations were averaging 54 cents per subscriber from TV distributors when the Dish deal was signed in 2012. CBS currently averages 89 cents but recent deals have been richer, according to SNL senior research analyst Justin Nielson.The standoff comes as cable, satellite and telecom video distributors increasingly are playing hard ball with program providers, resisting demands for steep price increases at a time when viewers are being drawn to Netflix and other forms of entertainment.Last year, CBS notched a high-profile victory in a fight with another distributor when Time Warner Cable was forced to back down and mostly give in to CBS's demands after a month-long programming blackout that incensed the cable company's subscribers. In that instance, CBS was asking for an agreement in which its fee would escalate to more than $2 per subscriber when the contract ended, according to reports at the time.CBS has argued in contract talks that the price it is seeking is justified by its status as the most watched TV network in the United States, with highly rated shows like ""NCIS"" and ""The Big Bang Theory"" and sports programming that includes NFL football. CBS spokeswoman Shannon Jacobs and Dish spokesman Bob Toevs had no comment.Dish is already locked in a contract standoff with Time Warner Inc's Turner Broadcasting and has removed several of its channels including CNN and the Cartoon Network. The two sides continue to talk, according to a person with knowledge with the Dish-Turner talks.The person said both Dish and Turner were making progress on price and hashing out details over Dish's streaming video service before the blackout on Oct. 21. The sticking point involved Turner's other two networks, TNT and TBS, which are under separate contracts, the person said.Negotiations about TNT and TBS are expected to start in a couple of weeks.

Thomson One users can register at RT/DAY/US. All times in ET/GMT) ADP is expected to report that U.S. private sector payroll growth accelerated slightly in October, with 220,000 new positions being added (0815/1315). Financial data firm Markit releases its final services PMI data for October (0945/1445) and the Institute of Supply Management releases services sector data for October (1000/1500).   Time Warner Inc is expected to report third-quarter results slightly below analysts' estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Time Warner said in October that it was launching HBO through Internet-connected devices that can bypass cable and satellite distributors. As there were scant details about the HBO standalone product, analysts will look for any progress on that front, including the price and partnerships.  CBS Corp's third-quarter earnings are likely to come below the average analyst estimate, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Weak advertising and a decline in television licensing revenue has been a drag on CBS, which airs hit shows such as ""The Big Bang Theory"" and ""NCIS"". The broadcaster, which owns the most-watched U.S. television network, had earlier said that it expected the second half of the year to be stronger, driven by heavy spending on political advertising due to mid-term elections scheduled in Florida and Michigan, markets with CBS-owned stations. CBS also launched a digital video-on-demand and live-streaming service in October to win back viewers who are increasingly turning to the Internet for entertainment.  Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis President Narayana Kocherlakota speaks on ""Clarifying the Objectives of Monetary Policy"" before the Laurentian Chamber of Commerce in Virginia (0915/1415). Separately, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond President Jeffrey Lacker speaks on ""Committing to Financial Stability"" before the ""Financial Stability after Dodd Frank: Have We Ended Too Big to Fail?"" conference sponsored by the George Washington University Center for Law, Economics and Finance (C-LEAF), Stanford Graduate School of Business and the Max Planck Institute for Research on Public Goods and Better Markets, in Washington. (0930/1430)  Tesla Motors Inc will report its third-quarter results. The focus will be on the progress towards the launch of the Model X SUV and the construction of its battery gigafactory. Analysts have speculated the Model X launch could be delayed, but the company has not said that. Tesla is on track to build the lithium-ion battery factory in the United States and investors will be looking for more details on that schedule.  Qualcomm Inc's fourth-quarter results may take a backseat to persistent concerns about its prospects in China, where it faces a murky government antitrust probe. For now, however, the largest maker of microchips for mobile devices continues to benefit from rapid, if slowing, global growth in smartphones and tablets.   Chesapeake Energy Corp is due to report third-quarter earnings and provide an update on its goals to cut costs and debt. Its earnings are likely to have been hit by weak prices for natural gas and natural gas liquids, especially in the Marcellus Shale, where a lack of infrastructure has hurt the market.  Duke Energy Corp is expected to report a higher profit for the second straight quarter, helped by cost cuts and increasing power demand in North Carolina, South Carolina and Florida. The company, which gets nearly 87 percent of its revenue from electric utilities, has benefited from higher power prices set by regulators. Duke Energy, which has been trying to exit the volatile wholesale power markets, sold some Midwest power assets in August. When the company reports third-quarter results, investors will want to know about the future of its utilities holdings and demand.  Continental Resources Inc, the largest oil producer in North Dakota's Bakken oil formation, is expected to post a jump in third-quarter profit. The results will be the first after an expected ruling in CEO Harold Hamm's divorce ruling, which could split the company in half.  Refiner HollyFrontier Inc is expected to report a higher third-quarter profit, helped by healthy gross margins for auxiliary products such as coke and asphalt. However, the focus this quarter will be on how the refiner is being affected by a steep drop in global oil prices.   Offshore oil and gas drilling services provider Rowan Co is expected to report a higher third-quarter profit due to higher rates for its drilling services. Investors will be looking at the company's ability to renew contracts for its offshore rigs in an oversupplied market.     Pipeline company Enbridge Inc is scheduled to report third-quarter results. The company reported a stronger-than-expected profit in the second quarter, driven mainly by higher shipment volumes on the Mainline and on its regional oil sands systems.   Kinross Gold Corp is expected to report a drop in third-quarter net income and revenue, reflecting declines in the price of bullion. The Toronto-based miner, which has operations in North and South America, Africa and Russia, will be watched for news on expansion plans for its Tasiast mine in Mauritania - notably any budget changes for the $1.6 billion project and financing plans. Investors will also watch for any comments on the resumption of dividend payments or developments at its La Coipa mine in Chile. Kinross said in July it had decided to start work on a pre-feasibility study for La Coipa, after suspending operations in late 2013.  Cash-strapped miner Molycorp Inc is expected to report a third-quarter loss and revenue nearly unchanged from the year-earlier period, as it sold more rare earth but at lower prices. Investors will look for comments on the company securing additional funds to ramp up operations at its flagship Mountain Pass facility in California, for which it secured a loan of $400 million from Oaktree Capital Management in August.  Fertilizer producer CF Industries Holdings Inc reports third-quarter results after markets close. The nitrogen producer, which recently broke off merger talks with industry leader Yara, is expected to earn less profit with weak crop prices and a late harvest dampening farmers' fertilizer buying.  Investors worried about decelerating same-store sales at Whole Foods Market Inc are bracing for the natural and organic food seller's forecasts for fiscal 2015 when it reports fourth-quarter results. Whole Foods is losing its grip on the niche it pioneered amid competition from rivals ranging from specialty grocers like Sprouts and Fresh Market to mainstream food sellers Wal-Mart and Kroger.  IT services provider Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp is likely to report third-quarter revenue below estimates as it expects delays in booking revenue from large deals, which the company's CEO attributed to leadership changes at some North American and UK clients.  Second-largest U.S. life insurer Prudential Financial Inc's third-quarter revenue and profit are expected to come below analysts' estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. The Japanese yen, which fell about 8.2 percent against the U.S. dollar in the third quarter, is likely to hurt the company as it earns more than half of its revenue from international operations, mainly Japan.   Canada's No.3 life insurer Sun Life Financial Inc reports third-quarter results. The company is expected to report earnings per share of 74 Canadian cents, helped by double digit revenue gains from a year earlier.   Symantec Corp, which makes Norton antivirus software, is expected to post a second-quarter profit below the average analyst estimate, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Its antivirus business has been hurt by slowing computer sales and sluggish demand for its storage and data management software continues to hurt its other business.  3D printer maker Stratasys Ltd is likely to report a third-quarter profit above analysts' estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. The company, which holds 55 percent of the market for printers priced at over $10,000, had raised its full-year forecast in August due to strong demand for its 3D printers. The company is also expected to face higher competition as other traditional printer makers such as HP have announced plans to enter the 3D printing market with faster and cheaper technology. Analysts and investors are looking for guidance in the context of competition from HP.  With newspapers struggling, News Corp has been spending its money in interesting places including real estate listing site Move Inc - its biggest acquisition to date. News Corp reports first-quarter results and investors will watch for whether the acquisitions have paid off.  WellCare Health Plans Inc's third-quarter revenue and profit are expected to come below estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data, owing to delays in reimbursements of an annual tax paid by health insurers to the U.S. federal government. At the same time, Medicaid plan managers like WellCare and peers Centene and Molina have seen an increase in patient volumes due to the expansion of the Medicaid program under Obamacare. Investors will focus on the increase in patient numbers and total medical costs of the company, which halved its full-year adjusted profit forecast in the second quarter.  October consumer confidence data for Mexico is scheduled for release. The index hit a three-month high in September as shoppers became more optimistic about the outlook for the country's economy (0900/1400).

136,"  (Adds estimates, details, share move)Nov 5 CBS Corp, owner of the most-watched U.S. television network, reported a marginally better-than-expected quarterly profit and revenue, driven by higher distribution revenue from licensing its television shows.The company's shares rose 3 percent after markets closed.CBS, the home of shows such as ""Madam Secretary"", ""Scorpion"", and ""NCIS: New Orleans"", said advertising revenue grew nearly 2 percent to $1.55 billion in the third quarter ended Sept. 30.This was driven by Thursday Night NFL games broadcast and political advertisements associated with midterm elections. Revenue from content licensing and distribution increased about 4 percent to $1.14 billion.Total revenue rose to $3.37 billion from $3.30 billion a year earlier. The company's cost rose as it spent more on television programming, including NFL games.Revenue at the entertainment segment - the company's biggest - grew 1.4 percent to $1.91 billion. However, higher costs, associated mainly with NFL broadcasts, ate into operating income from the segment. Net income from continuing operations slid to $72 million, or 13 cents per share, from $431 million, or 70 cents per share.On an adjusted basis, the company earned 74 cents per share from continuing operations.Analysts on average had expected a profit of 73 cents per share on revenue of $3.32 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

140,"   By Dave Sherwood | LEWISTON Maine  LEWISTON Maine Maine Republican Governor Paul LePage was re-elected in a tight race over Democratic challenger Mike Michaud on Tuesday, promising supporters he would improve Maine’s business climate and fight harder against welfare fraud.LePage, 66, is an outspoken Tea Party-backed conservative who was considered one of the most vulnerable governors in the country when the campaign began. He took 47.5 percent of the vote with 56 percent of precincts reporting by early Wednesday morning, while Michaud had 44.1 percent and center-left independent Eliott Cutler had 8.4 percent.""Thank you for trusting in our mission,"" LePage told a cheering crowd of supporters in a midnight victory speech at the Franco-American Center in his hometown of Lewiston. ""I have the American dream."" He did not mention Michaud in the speech, which began before Michaud could finish his concession.LePage, the product of a broken home and the eldest of 18 siblings, has been heralded by supporters as a self-made businessman who would help attract jobs and repair Maine’s ailing economy. He was first elected governor in 2010 on a wave of support from the Tea Party. He quickly gained national notoriety when he told state leaders of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People to ""kiss my butt,"" called climate change ""a scam,"" and made a crude sexual remark about an opposition leader’s use of Vaseline.LePage’s comments on climate change raised the ire of billionaire environmentalist and Democrat Tom Steyer, who spent nearly $2.3 million since August to attack LePage and push voters to Michaud, who campaigned on green energy reforms, tighter environmental regulations and a focus on climate change.In a concession speech in the Democratic bastion of Portland, Maine’s largest city, Michaud, a former millworker and six-term U.S. Representative, told supporters that he was disappointed but accepted the result. ""I want to congratulate Governor LePage on his re-election and I want to wish him the very best as he leads our state over the next four years,"" said Michaud, who would have become the first openly gay man to be elected governor of a U.S. state.Polls had showed LePage and Michaud in a statistical dead heat to the end, with Cutler, a businessman and Washington, D.C. lawyer, trailing far behind. LePage said he had ""gained a tremendous amount of respect"" for Cutler during the campaign. ""I told him tonight, you should be the attorney general of the state of Maine,"" he said.   Despite an early autumn snowstorm Sunday that led to widespread power outages and forced some polling centers to relocate, Maine voters swarmed polls in what officials predicted could be a record turnout.David Trubee, a retired, 71-year old veteran from Bowdoinham, Maine, said he voted for LePage.""He’s rough cut but very bright. What we need is a businessman to take charge and improve the business climate here. He’s done that,"" said Trubee.

172,"  Top-ranked Kentucky hasn’t met traditional West Coast power UCLA in eight years, but the Wildcats and Bruins start a three-year series on Saturday when they meet in the CBS Sports Classic on a neutral court in Chicago. The schools will play a home-and-home to complete the series and Kentucky coach John Calipari brings a talented force into the first one as the Wildcats have won their first 11 games by an average of 28.2 points. “We don’t have to play perfect,” UCLA forward Kevon Looney told reporters. “We can’t get behind teams that are this talented.”The Bruins lost to Gonzaga in their last contest to halt a four-game winning streak. Kentucky hears the chatter about the possibility of going unbeaten, but forward Trey Lyles says it doesn’t resonate. “I think all of us let it go in one ear and out the other, because it really doesn’t matter if we don’t go out there and perform,” Lyles told reporters. “So we need to go out there and play to the best of our abilities and play as a team and continue to win.”TV: 3:30 p.m. ET, CBS ABOUT UCLA (8-3): Guard Bryce Alford is developing as a go-to player with team-best averages of 18 points and 6.7 assists while guard Norman Powell averages 17.4 points. Looney has been fabulous as a freshman by averaging 13.9 points and 10.9 rebounds while guard Isaac Hamilton (11.6) and forward Tony Parker (10.8 points, 8.2 rebounds) also score in double digits. The only reserve averaging more than two points is center Thomas Welsh (4.7) so the lack of depth could be an issue against a Kentucky squad loaded with quality reserves.ABOUT KENTUCKY (11-0): Center Willie Cauley-Stein has picked up his production and that’s a good thing with forward Alex Poythress (knee) done for the season. Cauley-Stein scored 15 points in an 84-70 victory over North Carolina to record his fifth consecutive double-digit outing and raise his scoring average to a team-best 10.7, just ahead of guard Aaron Harrison (10.2). “I feel like I haven’t even begun to peak,” Cauley-Stein told reporters. “I’m just climbing. Like, if I want to, I could do something that’s really never been done in history, and that’s the way I look at it.” TIP-INS 1. A UCLA win would be the 500th of Alford’s coaching career. He’s 499-247. 2. Five Kentucky players have blocked 10 or more shots, led by F Karl-Anthony Towns with 29.3.

173,"   By Jennifer Saba and Lisa Richwine  NEW YORK/LAS VEGAS Jan 8 Media companies that are starting to allow their programs onto Internet-delivered TV and mobile devices are putting limits on digital rights as a safety hatch if problems arise with the new distribution systems, executives say.The debate over digital rights that determine how and when content is consumed is adding a new layer of complexity to negotiations between media companies and distributors, leading to drawn-out wrangling and programming blackouts in some cases.Such disputes are not new, but the need to hammer out a variety of digital rights is making talks more complicated.Media companies are considering joining streaming-only services, or launching their own like HBO and CBS, to attract young people who do not subscribe to traditional pay TV packages. But programmers also fear the packages could become so popular that they undercut current, more profitable deals with cable companies.The unveiling of Dish Network Corp's video streaming service, Sling TV, at the Consumer Electronics Show this week marks a turning point as Walt Disney Co  offered its sports juggernaut ESPN in a package that does not require a traditional TV subscription.One catch is that ESPN has a clause that lets it get out of Sling TV if the service signs up a certain number of subscribers, technology news website Re/code reported, citing anonymous sources. ESPN declined to comment on the specifics of the agreement.Some content providers that are considering joining video streaming services are mulling caps that would trigger new negotiations if viewership reaches certain levels, said two media executives who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue. Executives at various media companies said they have a new check list of questions for digital rights to Web-only television, mobile apps or on-demand programming. Distributors want more rights to air shows over a variety of services but there is also more pressure to monetize programming.Now programmers are asking: Is the content viewed in the home or outside the home? Is there video on demand? Do payment terms change if the number of subscribers skyrocket?CBS Corp, which was involved in a contract dispute with Dish late last year, granted Dish Showtime video-on-demand content but only within the home.Satellite and cable providers say they want to satisfy consumers' demands. ""We want our customers to have the ability to watch content on the screen of their choice and the location of their choice,"" said Cox Communications CEO Patrick Esser. ""All of that is a negotiation."" Dish CEO Joe Clayton said his company had no choice but to embrace new technology.""When the economy changes, consumers taste changes, technology changes, the competition changes, guess what? You better change,"" said Clayton. ""A lot of media companies don't want to change their business model.""For Sling TV, Clayton said ""we don't have a cap on what we are going to sell,"" but he declined to offer specific details on agreements with programmers.Dish has been involved in numerous contract disputes in recent months with media companies ranging from CBS to Time Warner Inc's Turner Broadcasting, to Twenty-First Century Fox, whose news and business cable networks have been blacked out to Dish's 14 million customers since late December. Clayton said his company's role as ""disruptors and pioneers, especially in technology"" has led to disputes with programmers.The digital rights battle comes as profit margins are thinning for many cable and satellite companies, which are trying to keep subscribers as programming costs rise. Rights for sporting events, in particular, have soared.The average cost for a cable company to carry a network has risen from 25 cents a month per subscriber in 2010 to 30 cents  in 2014, SNL Kagan estimated.""When programmers and broadcasters ask for 200 or 300 percent increases, somebody's got to say 'whoa,'"" said Clayton.At the same time, the growth in pay TV subscriptions - once tied to a robust housing market - is at a near standstill. MoffettNathanson Research estimates quarterly subscriber losses of about 0.1 percent over the past two years.""People love television. They want it all and it's getting expensive,"" Charter Communications CEO Tom Rutledge said.""Operators ... are trying to control costs and programmers are not growing, so they are trying to make up for that.""

176,"  (Adds details on agreement paragraphs 6, 8)By Lisa RichwineLOS ANGELES Jan 15 The Fox News and Fox Business channels returned on Thursday to satellite TV provider Dish Network Corp's lineup after both sides agreed to a multiyear deal.The channels owned by Rupert Murdoch's Twenty-First Century Fox Inc had been blacked out for Dish's 14 million customers since Dec. 21 when the companies failed to agree on a new contract.Pay TV providers and programmers have sparred in recent months over the fees paid to carry networks. Digital rights to provide shows online and on mobile devices also have complicated the negotiations. In a video also posted online on Thursday, Dish Chairman Charlie Ergen thanked customers who were ""supportive of our stance for fair rates and terms.""""I know this has been a frustrating several weeks for some of our customers,"" Ergen said. A source close to the negotiations said Dish agreed to pay an average monthly fee of $1.50 per subscriber for Fox News, the most-watched cable news network. The fee is ""significantly higher"" than what Dish paid previously, the source said.""We thank the viewers of Fox News and Fox Business and Dish customers for their patience throughout this process,"" Tim Carry, executive vice president of distribution for Fox News and Fox Business, and Warren Schlichting, Dish senior vice president of programming, said in a joint statement. The deal does not include rights for Dish to put the Fox channels on its new Sling TV online service, the source said. Sling TV is a slimmed down $20-a-month package that the company will launch later this month to reach customers who do not want to pay for the more expensive traditional TV service.Dish has battled recently with other content providers, including CBS Corp and Time Warner Inc's Turner Broadcasting. Dish customers faced a 12-hour blackout of CBS and went for a month without Turner networks including CNN and Cartoon Network before deals were reached to restore them.(Reporting by Lisa Richwine; Editing by James Dalgleish and Lisa Shumaker)",2015-01-16,CBS,"Thu Jan 15, 2015 | 8:20pm EST","UPDATE 2-Dish reaches deal that brings back Fox news, business channels",http://www.reuters.com//article/dish-fox-idUSL1N0UU31L20150116?type=companyNews

Brian Buroker of Gibson Dunn, who argued for the New York Times, said that he was disappointed in the decision and that they were considering an appeal.Buroker also said that they had asked the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to re-examine portions of six of the seven patents in the litigation.

""I will miss him every day of my life.""Tarkanian, known as ""Tark the Shark"" and for his penchant to gnaw on white towels during games, had been hospitalized in Las Vegas after suffering breathing difficulties and an infection on Monday.""He made Runnin’ Rebel basketball a brand name during his 19 years on campus, inspiring our community and creating a legacy that endures to this day,"" UNLV President Len Jessup said in a statement.""He will be deeply missed, though fondly remembered as a college basketball icon and as one of the greats in our university’s history."" Tarkanian, who was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2013, often looked anguished on the sidelines and regularly chewed on a towel at courtside. A statue of him with a towel in his mouth was installed outside the UNLV arena.Amid his success, Tarkanian had many well-publicized battles with the National Collegiate Athletic Association over everything from recruiting violations to what he claimed was personal harassment.Tarkanian's teams were known for a fast-paced style that often led to blowouts, like when UNLV's Runnin' Rebels defeated Duke, 103-73, in the 1990 NCAA title game. He had a 509-105 record at UNLV and was 784-202 overall at Division 1 schools. ""No one in Nevada history has been able to entertain crowds like Jerry Tarkanian and his legendary Runnin' Rebels; this includes renowned Vegas entertainers like Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Cher and Celine Dion,"" said U.S. Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid of Nevada.Tarkanian coached UNLV from 1973-92, resigning when the program ran into trouble with the NCAA after a local newspaper published a picture showing three of his players in a hot tub with a well-known gambler who had been convicted of sports bribery.Among his biggest spats with the NCAA was Tarkanian's belief that the large schools received favorable treatment when it came to following the rules. ""The NCAA is so upset at UCLA they’ll put Northridge on two years' probation,"" he once said.Tarkanian coached the NBA's San Antonio Spurs for the first 20 games of the 1992 season before being fired. He finished his career coaching the Fresno State University from 1995 to 2002.Tarkanian began his coaching career in southern California, working at community colleges in the 1960s before becoming the coach at Long Beach state in 1968.

The company offered free independent home air-quality testing and said it would consider more advanced testing if results were above accepted levels. It said it would consider reinstalling flooring for customers not satisfied with results.Its shares rose as much as 15.4 percent in heavy trading on Thursday.Lumber Liquidators came under fire after CBS's ""60 Minutes"" show alleged that laminates sourced by the company from China had higher-than-permitted levels of formaldehyde, a carcinogen. The company gets about 52 percent of its laminates from China. Several U.S. government agencies are discussing the allegations. To Wednesday's close, the company's stock had halved in value since Feb. 25, when the company said the CBS show would portray it in an ""unfavorable light.""In a detailed defense, Chief Executive Rob Lynch said on a conference call that fewer than 1,000 customers who purchased laminates sourced from China had requested the testing kit. The company has about 600,000 customers.

206,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, July 07 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'BBB' rating to CBS  Corporation's (CBS) proposed issuance of benchmark-sized senior unsecured notes  maturing in 2025. The proceeds from the offering are expected to be used for  general corporate purpose including the repayment of short-term debt and share  repurchases. Fitch currently has a 'BBB' Issuer Default Rating (IDR) for CBS. The Rating  Outlook for the IDR, as well as all of CBS' ratings is Stable. A full list of  ratings follows at the end of this release. CBS had approximately $7.7 billion  of debt outstanding as of March 31, 2015.  The notes will rank pari passu with all other unsecured and unsubordinated  indebtedness of CBS and will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed by CBS  Operations Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of CBS that directly or indirectly  owns Showtime Networks, Simon & Schuster, CBS Television Studios, 10 of the  company's 29 full-power broadcast television stations, and the partnership  interest in The CW Network. CBS will issue the senior notes under the amended  and restated indenture dated as of Nov. 3, 2008 and first supplemental indenture  dated as of April 5, 2010.  Terms as proposed are similar to those of previously issued notes, including i)  a limitation on liens of up to 15% of total consolidated assets (excluding  standard carve-outs); ii) the ability to sell or convey assets that generate  less than 80% of total consolidated revenues; and iii) an obligation of CBS to  make an offer to repurchase the notes at 101% upon change of control (as defined  in the indenture) and non-investment-grade ratings, as defined. Similar to  existing bonds, there are no financial covenants. There is no coupon step-up  provision in this issuance. The issuance is in line with Fitch's expectations that CBS will gradually  increase its debt and increase leverage to its target ranging between 2.5x and  2.75x, which is in line with Fitch's 2.75x gross leverage target for the current  ratings. CBS' content centric business strategy, which focuses on more stable  and recurring revenue streams and positions the company to reduce its exposure  to more volatile advertising revenues can, in Fitch's opinion support the  company's leverage target.  KEY RATING DRIVERS --Share repurchases continue to be the centerpiece of CBS' capital allocation  strategy. Shareholder returns that exceed free cash flow (FCF) generation are  incorporated into the current ratings to the extent that leverage remains below  Fitch's 2.75x total leverage threshold. --Fitch anticipates that CBS will maintain a rational approach to managing its  balance sheet while increasing leverage to its target. Capital allocation will  continue to prioritize investment in content creation and programming while  preserving the historically conservative financial policy of its capital  structure in the context of its leverage target and participating in merger and  acquisition activity. --Growing content licensing and distribution, affiliate and subscription  revenues are improving CBS' revenue mix and are in line with the company's  long-term objective to increase non-advertising revenue sources. However, CBS'  exposure to advertising revenues at 50% is relatively high compared to other  diversified media companies. --CBS expects that its retransmission consent/reverse compensation revenue will  grow to $1 billion by 2017 and to $2 billion by 2020. This revenue stream  provides a stable and recurring element to CBS' revenue base, which mitigates  some of the volatility associated with advertising revenues. Additionally, the  high margin characteristic of these revenues strengthens the company's operating  profile. CBS' ratings reflect the strong competitive position of the CBS television  network and studio as well as largely stable demand for its various advertising  platforms. The broadcast network, owing to its ratings strength, is  well-positioned to capture large viewing audiences amid an increasingly  fractured media landscape. Fitch believes that demand for the television  studio's content remains strong across all major end markets. Rating concerns include an above-average exposure to cyclical advertising  revenue and the company's capacity to adapt to ever-changing media consumption  patterns, emerging distribution platforms, and technology evolution all of which  will drive audience fragmentation and disrupt traditional media models.  Additional concerns center on the company's ability to balance escalating  programming expense and production costs with the requirement to consistently  deliver programs that drive incremental share of an increasingly fragmented  viewing audience while maintaining or expanding operating margins. Leverage and Financial Policy CBS' capital structure and credit protection metrics remain stable and within  Fitch's expectations for the current rating. However, CBS' leverage target  diminishes the capacity and financial flexibility the company has at the current  rating level from Fitch's perspective. However, Fitch expects that CBS will  continue investing in its core businesses and growth initiatives and support  shareholder returns within the context of managing to its leverage target.  Consolidated leverage was 2.3x as of the latest 12 months (LTM) period ended  March 31, 2015.  CBS' ongoing investment in content and programming holds the highest priority in  terms of capital allocation. Share repurchases continue to be the centerpiece of  CBS' capital allocation strategy and the primary tool the company will utilize  to achieve its leverage target. Shareholder returns that exceed FCF generation  are incorporated into the current ratings to the extent that leverage remains  below Fitch's 2.75x total leverage threshold.  Shareholder Returns Shareholder returns (dividends and share repurchases) totaled approximately $3.9  billion during the year ended Dec. 31, 2014 (before consideration of CBS Outdoor  Americas) representing 364% of FCF before dividends. CBS repurchased  approximately $1 billion of its common stock during the first quarter of 2015;  leaving approximately $3.8 billion of capacity remaining on its share repurchase  authorization as of March 31, 2015. Fitch expects CBS will utilize the remaining  share repurchase authorization by year-end 2016. FCF and Liquidity  The operating leverage inherent in CBS' business along with modest capital  intensity enables the company to generate meaningful levels of free cash flow  and provides the company with substantial financial flexibility. CBS generated  approximately $587 million of FCF from continuing operations (defined as cash  flow from operations less capital expenditures and dividends), during the LTM  period ended March 31, 2015, which follows $712 million of FCF generation during  the year ended Dec. 31, 2014. Fitch notes that 2014 FCF generation was impacted  by a $360 million payment related to the early termination of debt during 2014  and higher programming costs. Going forward, Fitch anticipates that the company  will consistently generate consolidated free cash flow in excess of $1.2 billion  providing CBS with adequate flexibility with in the current ratings to  accommodate its capital allocation policy. CBS' liquidity position is strong and supported by $331 million of cash on hand  as of March 31, 2015, $2.5 billion in available credit facilities (all of which  was available as of March 31, 2015, and expected FCF generation. CBS' revolver  commitment expires on Dec. 15, 2019. Scheduled maturities are well-laddered and  manageable considering expected FCF generation, reliable market access and  backup liquidity. Approximately 20% of the company's debt outstanding as of Dec.  31, 2014 (pro forma for the January 2015 debt issuance) is scheduled to mature  over the next five years, including $200 million during 2016, $400 million in  2017, $300 million in 2018 and $600 million in 2018. KEY ASSUMPTIONS  Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case include: --Low to mid-single digit revenue growth is assumed within CBS' Entertainment  segment. Revenue growth benefits from the broadcast of the Superbowl in 2016 and  strong political ad spending.  --The base case further assumes a stable economic and advertising environment.  --Syndication revenues will continue to be variable and dependent on content  availability. CBS is positioned to capitalize on its strong position in first  run syndication (15 of the top 20 syndication shows), a solid pipeline of  content coming to off-network syndication and incremental demand for content  from OTT and SVOD providers.  --Cable Network segment revenue growth reflects the stability of the business  and modest affiliation fee increases. The company's investment in original  programming supports affiliation fee growth. Fitch anticipates mid-single digit  revenue growth.  --Publishing revenues decline modestly in the base case reflecting the ongoing  impact of digital migration. --Local Broadcasting segment again incorporates a stable economic and  advertising environment as well as the typical political advertising cycle.  Additionally the segment will benefit from growing retransmission consent  revenues. These considerations are offset somewhat by continued weak CBS Radio  revenue growth. Revenue growth ranges between 4% and -1% in the base case.  --From a margin perspective, the base case assumes modest margin expansion  within the Entertainment segment reflecting growth in higher margin syndication  and OTT and SVOD revenues. This is offset by higher content and programming  costs.  --Cable Network margins are pressured due to increasing programming costs due to  higher investment in original programming. Offset by benefits from new  distribution windows. --Publishing margins increases modestly to reflect changing revenue mix to  higher margin digital sales.  --Local Broadcast margins move in tandem with the political cycle.  --All debt is refinanced at maturity. Incremental debt issuance to support share  buybacks and lever the balance sheet to the new target over the ratings horizon.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive rating action would likely coincide with CBS adopting a more  conservative financial policy highlighted by a gross leverage target of 2.25x or  lower. Moreover, Fitch needs to observe meaningful progress in CBS' efforts to  transform its revenue mix and reduce its reliance on cyclical advertising  revenues. Meanwhile, CBS will need to demonstrate that its operating profile can  sustain itself amid ongoing competitive pressures, changing media consumption  patterns and evolving technology platforms.  Negative rating actions are more likely to coincide with discretionary actions  of CBS management including, but not limited to, the company adopting a more  aggressive financial strategy which increases leverage beyond 3x or event-driven  merger and acquisition activity that drive leverage beyond 3.5x in the absence  of a creditable deleveraging plan.  Additionally, negative rating actions could result should Fitch begin to observe  a negative impact from alternative content distribution platforms and other  forms of entertainment that is significantly larger than Fitch's expectations.  Other negative triggers include a weakening of the company's television studio's  ability to produce desired television content, or secure programming on its  television networks that consistently delivers viewing audience and related  advertising revenues. Total debt at March 31, 2015 was $7.7 billion, which consisted primarily of: --Approximately $7.6 billion senior unsecured notes and debentures maturing  2016-2045; --$46 million senior unsecured notes issued at CBS' wholly owned subsidiary CBS  Broadcasting, Inc., which are not guaranteed by CBS Corp; --$95 million of capital leases and other obligations; --CBS did not have any outstanding commercial paper as of March 31, 2015.

215,"   By Jessica Toonkel and Lehar Maan  CBS Corp (CBS.N), owner of the most-watched U.S. TV network, beat Wall Street's earnings expectations, but reported quarterly revenue slightly below analysts' estimates due to lower advertising sales and content licensing fees.The company, which owns cable channel Showtime and CBS Sports Networks, radio stations and the Simon & Schuster publishing house, said it expects advertising spending for the Super Bowl and political campaigns will bolster revenue for 2016.Advertising revenue, which accounted for about 45 percent of its total revenue in the latest quarter, fell 4.3 percent.The company is trying to rely less on advertising revenue, which can be volatile due to its dependence on popular sporting or political events, and is focusing more on its online subscription streaming services such as CBS All Access.

223,"   By Ross Kerber and Jessica Toonkel | BOSTON/NEW YORK  BOSTON/NEW YORK An official for the second-largest U.S. public pension system on Thursday urged Viacom Inc to do away with its dual-class share structure, the latest call from an investor for change at the media empire controlled by the aging mogul Sumner Redstone as doubts grow over his ability to lead.Redstone, 92 years old, controls about 80 percent of the voting rights at Viacom, and the company has a second class of shares with no voting rights. The California State Teachers' Retirement System has 1.1 million non-voting shares. ""Ideally we think there should be a one-share, one-vote capital structure,"" said Aeisha Mastagni, an investment officer for the $184 billion system known as CalSTRS, in an interview on Thursday. While not a top-20 investor in Viacom, CalSTRS is an influential activist shareholder and has supported calls for the end of dual-class structures at other companies. It has not previously focused on Viacom.Mike McCauley, senior officer at the Florida State Board of Administration, which has $144 billion in pension assets and is another high profile voice on governance with a mid-sized stake in Viacom, said on Thursday that he also supports the idea that Viacom should move to a one-share, one-vote capital structure.Viacom has denied any issues with Redstone's mental capability. Asked about its share structure, Viacom spokesman Jeremy Zweig said via email that ""we believe that it has contributed, and continues to contribute, to our stability and long-term stockholder returns."" He added that it ""allows investors an opportunity to participate financially in companies in which the existing owners may not wish to part with voting control.”Other media companies use dual-share class structures as well, making similar arguments that they can help stave off attacks by activist investors. Questions about Redstone's health have been growing for months, raising concerns about management's ability to focus on recovering from a drop in TV ratings. Investors are becoming more vocal in their requests for information and control as Redstone's own influence wanes.Mastagni's remarks come after Manuela Herzer, a former girlfriend of Redstone, said in a lawsuit he was no longer mentally competent, leading two major investors in Viacom on Wednesday to question whether Redstone should step down as executive chairman.Mastagni said she would have the concerns about the share structure whatever Redstone's health might be, though she did say the situation is ""like a soap opera.""The lack of voting rights for many investors means Viacom's board is insulated from investor pressure, she said. The company has faced criticism from corporate governance advisers over its high pay for executives, but Mastagni said there is little investors can do.""This is an example, putting Mr. Redstone aside, where the minority shareholders have no way to hold the board accountable,"" she said. ""Our view is that if you’re tapping into the public markets, you should have a one-share, one-vote capital structure."" Investors have raised other governance concerns at Viacom. One issue is that Viacom CEO Philippe Dauman is also executor of Redstone’s will and has power of attorney over his health care, a potential conflict, according to one top-10 Viacom investor, who wished to remain anonymous.Viacom declined to comment on the concerns about Philippe's roles. Such an arrangement would not stand in a public company with a single share class, where investors would have more ability to push for changes, said James Post, a professor in the business school of Boston University.""This is clearly not something you would see in most public companies,"" Post said. ""It’s really residue of the transition from a family-owned business to a publicly traded one.""As a large investor CalSTRS has come to play an influential role on U.S. corporate governance matters. In addition to its stake in Viacom, it owns 1.9 million non-voting shares of CBS Corp, the other big media company controlled by Redstone.The Florida board holds 763,303 non-voting shares in Viacom and 763,458 non-voting shares in CBS.Calls to expand voting rights or to eliminate dual-share class structures have been a common theme for pension funds in recent years, especially as technology firms have embraced multiple share classes. While Viacom has not faced a shareholder proposal on its structure in recent years, according to FactSet data, Mastagni said CalSTRS supported proposals to eliminate dual-share classes at social media company Facebook Inc and at cable television firm Comcast Corp. Both proposals failed to get a majority of votes.

The cable network has been under pressure due to weak ratings and concerns about the mental condition of 92-year-old Redstone, whose holding company, National Amusements, has about 80 percent of the voting stock at Viacom and CBS (CBS.N). A November lawsuit by an ex-girlfriend of Redstone has  raised questions about his ability lead the company as well. Viacom has maintained Redstone is in full mental control. It said the most recent lawsuit was without merit and it would contest it vigorously. It also responded to the activist report, saying it was focused on long-term value for shareholders. ""We are encouraged by the growth in our strong international business, the ratings upswings at most of our networks, Paramount’s strong start in 2016, our leadership position in advertising technology and other positive recent developments,” Viacom said in a statement.CBS, also named in the lawsuit, declined to comment. The shareholder lawsuit, filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery against the boards of Viacom and CBS, alleges the companies improperly paid millions for Redstone's services as executive chairman ""while he was physically and mentally incapacitated.""  Payments to Redstone ""for services not rendered"" amounted to bad faith by the two boards, the lawsuit said. It also said the Viacom board misrepresented Redstone's deteriorated physical and mental condition in a January 2015 proxy statement. Such derivative lawsuits, in which a shareholder sues on behalf of the company against a third party such as the board, are difficult to pursue but provide a new public forum for outsiders to question Redstone's abilities. ""It's a pretty tough uphill battle to pursue a derivative suit,"" said Lawrence Hamermesh, professor of corporate and business law at Widener University School of Law. ""The key is whether there is enough here to call into question the independence of the members of the compensation committee.""The lawsuit said that board members were personally loyal to Redstone and their actions proved their lack of independence.  Separately, in a paper published on Tuesday, activist investor Eric Jackson, managing director at SpringOwl Asset Management, called for changes to Viacom's board and management and suggested it should consider merging with AMC Entertainment Holdings (AMC.N). Jackson declined to comment on how many shares his firm owns. His paper came as investors are being asked to consider whether Viacom should allow all shareholders to vote. Redstone will oppose the measure, assuring its failure, but investors welcomed Jackson's move.Viacom's shares, which nearly halved in value in 2015, rose 7.5 percent to $42.86 in morning trading on Tuesday. ""Viacom management has underperformed for years with no accountability,"" Jackson said, calling the company's board one of the biggest and highest paid in the media industry. Questions about whether Redstone is capable of continuing as executive chairman of Viacom and CBS were heightened in November after former girlfriend Manuela Herzer filed a lawsuit that raised doubts about the billionaire' s competence. In that suit, Herzer is seeking to have Redstone examined to see if he was mentally able to make decisions for himself. The Redstone controversy began last fall when Herzer was thrown off his advance healthcare directive and escorted out of his sprawling hilltop estate. She sued, contending the mogul was in no position to make such decisions.Redstone named Viacom Chief Executive Philippe Dauman as his new health care agent. Dauman filed a motion on Friday in a New York court seeking to stop his deposition in connection with Herzer's case.  The New York Times first reported on Jackson's presentation earlier on Tuesday.

237,"  * Activist calls for Redstone's resignation* Lawsuit alleges Viacom, CBS misrepresented Redstone's health   (Adds information about shareholder lawsuit, comments from Jackson and Viacom)By Dan Levine and Jessica ToonkelJan 19 Investors targeted Viacom Inc on two fronts on Tuesday, in a lawsuit alleging Executive Chairman Sumner Redstone is incapacitated and should not have been paid millions in compensation, and in an activist investor presentation calling for changes to the board and management.The separate moves were the latest challenges to New York-based Viacom, whose networks include Nickelodeon, MTV and Comedy Central. The cable network has been under pressure due to weak ratings and concerns about the mental condition of 92-year-old Redstone, whose holding company, National Amusements, has about 80 percent of the voting stock at Viacom and CBS.A November lawsuit by an ex-girlfriend of Redstone has  raised questions about his ability lead the company as well.Viacom has maintained Redstone is in full mental control. It said the most recent lawsuit was without merit and it would contest it vigorously. It also responded to the activist report, saying it was focused on long-term value for shareholders.""We are encouraged by the growth in our strong international business, the ratings upswings at most of our networks, Paramount's strong start in 2016, our leadership position in advertising technology and other positive recent developments,"" Viacom said in a statement. CBS, also named in the lawsuit, declined to comment.The shareholder lawsuit, filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery against the boards of Viacom and CBS, alleges the companies improperly paid millions for Redstone's services as executive chairman ""while he was physically and mentally incapacitated.""Payments to Redstone ""for services not rendered"" amounted to bad faith by the two boards, the lawsuit said. It also said the Viacom board misrepresented Redstone's deteriorated physical and mental condition in a January 2015 proxy statement.Such derivative lawsuits, in which a shareholder sues on behalf of the company against a third party such as the board, are difficult to pursue but provide a new public forum for outsiders to question Redstone's abilities. ""It's a pretty tough uphill battle to pursue a derivative suit,"" said Lawrence Hamermesh, professor of corporate and business law at Widener University School of Law.

The judge said in his ruling called Gold's deposition testimony ""equivocal"" and ""inconsistent"" with his declaration.

Redstone's annual salary rose to $2 million in fiscal 2015 from $1,935,577 the prior year. Viacom said in the filing that for fiscal 2015 the total pay of Chief Operating Officer Thomas Dooley fell to $29.4 million from $35 million in the prior year. Dooley's employment agreement is due  to expire at the end of this year, which has raised questions about whether he will stay with the company.CEO Dauman's pay last year included a stock award worth $17 million tied to the renewal of his contract. Dauman's bonus was $14 million, down from $20 million the prior year, while Dooley's bonus was $11.2 million, down from $16 million in the prior year. Viacom said both executives had requested that their bonus payments be reduced so money could be shifted to increase incentive payments at the company's operating units.

250,"   By Ross Kerber | BOSTON  BOSTON Viacom Inc said on Friday it cut the total pay of its 92-year-old Executive Chairman Sumner Redstone by 85 percent to $2 million last year in light of his ""reduced responsibilities"" and that it had raised the pay of Viacom Chief Executive Philippe Dauman.In a securities filing, the media company said the total compensation of Dauman rose to $54.2 million for the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, 2015, up from $44.3 million in the previous period, driven by a contract renewal award. The company's shares fell 44 percent during the period.Viacom, whose networks include Comedy Central, MTV and Nickelodeon, has faced ratings challenges, cord-cutting by cable TV consumers, and growing concerns about the health of Redstone, its founder, and his fitness to oversee the company.Even as the company was issuing its annual proxy filing, a California judge ruled on Friday that Redstone could be examined by a doctor hired by his ex-girlfriend in a dispute over his mental competency. Also, a recent lawsuit claims that Viacom and CBS Corp,  where Redstone is also executive chairman, improperly paid millions for Redstone's services even though he was ""incapacitated"". Viacom's filing did not describe how Redstone's responsibilities had been reduced, and a company spokesman said on Friday that he did not have more details.Viacom had outlined some of the pay changes on Jan. 20, but it had not said that Redstone's duties had been decreased or that Dauman would get a pay increase overall. Redstone's new role meant he was no longer eligible to receive a bonus, which was $10 million in the previous fiscal year, Viacom said. Redstone's annual salary rose to $2 million in fiscal 2015 from $1,935,577 the prior year. Viacom said in the filing that for fiscal 2015 the total pay of Chief Operating Officer Thomas Dooley fell to $29.4 million from $35 million in the prior year. Dooley's employment agreement is due  to expire at the end of this year, which has raised questions about whether he will stay with the company.CEO Dauman's pay last year included a stock award worth $17 million tied to the renewal of his contract. Dauman's bonus was $14 million, down from $20 million the prior year, while Dooley's bonus was $11.2 million, down from $16 million in the prior year. Viacom said both executives had requested that their bonus payments be reduced so money could be shifted to increase incentive payments at the company's operating units.

264,"   By Jessica Toonkel | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Viacom Inc's board of directors named Chief Executive Officer Philippe Dauman as executive chairman, replacing majority owner Sumner Redstone, overriding calls for an independent board chief from Redstone's daughter, who voted against Dauman. Viacom (VIAB.O) announced on Thursday that the ailing 92-year-old Redstone was becoming chairman emeritus, a day after CBS Corp (CBS.N) said Redstone, also the CBS majority owner, was stepping down as executive chairman and being replaced by CEO Leslie Moonves.The boards of CBS and Viacom have been discussing Redstone stepping down for several weeks, according to two sources familiar with the situation. Thursday's decision puts Viacom firmly in the hands of Dauman, a longtime associate of Sumner Redstone. His daughter, Shari, said in a statement she wanted someone who was not a member of her father's trust to run Viacom, which would have excluded Dauman.Dauman and Moonves are natural rivals as leaders of the two halves of the empire that Redstone separated 10 years ago. After Redstone's eventual death, analysts expect several scenarios, such as selling the companies in pieces, leaving them as they are, or reuniting them, which could pit the executives against one another. Sumner Redstone and the rest of Viacom's board voted in favor of Dauman, and only Shari Redstone voted against him, according to a source close to the company. Viacom said Shari Redstone turned down the non-executive chairman role. Shari Redstone will ""continue to advocate for what she believes to be in the best interests of Viacom shareholders,” she said in a statement. Viacom shares initially rose sharply, but later pared gains, closing up 1.5 percent at $45.34 on Nasdaq.Investor reaction was mixed. SpringOwl Asset Management, a Viacom shareholder that has agitated for change, was disappointed by the move. ""It raises questions about the board, corporate governance and fiduciary duties,"" the firm said in a statement. ""The market agrees ... that someone other than Philippe Dauman should be the Chairman."" Michael Cuggino, president and portfolio manager at San Francisco-based Permanent Portfolio of Family Of Funds, which is the fifth largest voting shareholder in Viacom and CBS,  applauded Dauman's appointment, and was willing to give him time to improve the company’s performance. “Viacom’s issues have not gone away and they still need to be tackled, but all the noise surrounding Sumner’s situation has been taken out of the equation,” Cuggino said. “The answer to whether Philippe is the right guy to do this will come later.""Sal Muoio, whose investment firm also is a top owner of voting Viacom shares, said he is also willing to give Dauman time: “This at least is a step toward clarity. I think we need to wait and see how these operational things unfold.” Mario Gabelli, the largest Viacom shareholder outside the Redstone family, said on financial news channel CNBC that Dauman has six to nine months to prove himself. ""Philippe has to deliver,"" Gabelli told Reuters in an interview. ""How does he jump-start the process? It's going to be tough to get into the digital world and over-the-top (Internet), given his perception of what his core competences are. It's going to be a challenge."" Gabelli dismissed the idea that Moonves could take over both companies: “He can’t do both, I don’t think.” Redstone hived off Viacom from CBS, expecting faster growth from the owner of MTV and Paramount than the storied television network, but in recent years CBS has outperformed Viacom. CBS shares are up more than 135 percent in the last five years, while Viacom has eked out a 3 percent gain.Viacom in recent years has suffered from falling ratings at its cable networks as its audience of younger viewers migrate to online and mobile video. In April 2015, the company announced a restructuring to save $350 million annually. Dauman has taken steps to woo advertisers by using data to better target their commercials. The elder Redstone has faced questions about his health and leadership abilities for some time. He underwent a mental examination last Friday by a psychiatrist hired by his former girlfriend, Manuela Herzer, who has challenged Redstone's mental competency in a lawsuit.The results of the examination have not been made public. Neither CBS nor Viacom explained why Redstone stepped aside. After Herzer's lawsuit, investor Gabelli called for the media company to disclose the state of Redstone's mental competence.Shari Redstone, 60, has said both companies needed an ""independent voice"" as chair who was not involved in the family's personal matters. She supported Moonves as CBS chief.Dauman serves as a Sumner Redstone trustee in the event of his death as well as his health care proxy. Shari Redstone believes Herzer's lawsuit is weighing on her father's mind. ""Ms. Herzer's lawsuit, and the fact she is actually trying to once again insert herself into my father's life, is causing my father tremendous stress and agitation,"" she said in a declaration to a California court filed this week. Redstone controls about 80 percent of the voting shares in Viacom and CBS Corp through a holding company.In January, Viacom said it cut the compensation of its top two executives, Redstone and Dauman, as the company faced business pressures and a sharp drop in its share price.

265,"  (Repeats to additional subscribers)By Jessica ToonkelFeb 8 CBS Corp CEO Leslie Moonves, who was given the additional title of executive chairman last week, is planning more original content and looking at taking some of his network's shows off the air and putting them exclusively on its subscription-based CBS All Access service, to compete with the growing popularity of Netflix Inc and Hulu.It is a bold but not sudden move for the traditional television executive running a network known for its older viewers, who approached the digital TV revolution gingerly but is now pushing his company to its forefront.The network's push to ramp up its online All Access service - which offers its shows on PCs, tablets and smartphones for $5.99 a month - comes as media companies are rethinking their business models and their relationships with streaming video providers, treating them more like competitors than allies.Advertising is still important for CBS - home of the Super Bowl this year - but the focus is shifting to new revenue streams.""When I started this job 20 years ago, advertising was everything to this company,"" Moonves told Reuters in an interview in his Los Angeles office last Monday, as he prepared to travel to the San Francisco Bay Area for the big game. ""Advertising will still remain important, but it's not nearly as important as some of these new ways of getting revenue, such as interactive.""Moonves is also considering putting shows on All Access from the CW Network, its joint venture with Time Warner Inc's  Warner Bros, which produced the offbeat hits ""Crazy Ex-Girlfriend"" and ""Jane the Virgin."" Ultimately, Moonves said he wants the service to include content from its Showtime subsidiary, best known for ""Homeland"" and ""Dexter,"" and possibly shows from other partners.He would not say which CBS shows - which include hits such as ""The Big Bang Theory"" and ""The Good Wife"" - would be candidates for exclusive distribution on the All Access service, but suggested it would be original content and shows that have an avid fan base but not necessarily high ratings.CBS already said last year that its new ""Star Trek"" series, scheduled for 2017, would premiere on the network then switch exclusively to All Access. Moonves said CBS could have sold ""Star Trek"" to Netflix, Amazon.com Inc or Hulu for ""a pretty nice profit,"" but instead is betting that it will attract more mobile-savvy viewers willing to pay for subscriptions, which he hopes will be more valuable in the long term.""Star Trek"" is for All Access what ""House of Cards"" was to Netflix, he said.Moonves now has complete control at CBS to push his digital agenda. Two days after Moonves spoke to Reuters, longtime CBS chairman and majority owner Sumner Redstone stepped aside and Moonves was handed the chairman role, with the blessing of Redstone's daughter Shari.The day after that Redstone also stepped aside at his other majority-owned media company Viacom, and his role went to CEO Philippe Dauman, over the objections of Shari. OLD-SCHOOL Moonves, who splits his time between Beverly Hills and New York and describes himself as an ""old school media guy,"" has spent most of his career in television, developing hits such as ""Friends"" and ""Everybody loves Raymond.""When Redstone split CBS from Viacom 10 years ago, investors saw the mainstream broadcaster as the slow-moving company catering to an older audience, compared to the young, scrappy Viacom, whose networks include Nickelodeon and MTV. But CBS shares have easily outperformed those of Viacom over the last five years.Mario Gabelli, the second-largest shareholder of Viacom and CBS, wants to see Viacom take a page out of Moonves' digital strategy playbook. ""It's going to be tough to get into the digital world and over-the-top,"" he told Reuters.Digital success has helped Moonves gain favor with Shari Redstone, who is vice-chair of the boards of CBS and Viacom, and nominated Moonves for the CBS executive chairman role. ""Les and I get together frequently and he is always asking me what companies I am investing in and what I am seeing,"" said Shari Redstone, whose firm, Advancit Capital, invests in early-stage companies in technology and media. ""He is fascinated with everything.""The 66-year-old Moonves may not be a millennial but he is more familiar than most of his generation with the latest technology. Delivery service Postmates and route-finder Waze are  two of his favorite apps. Every few months he visits Silicon Valley to see what is new, and said he would be open to a seat on the board of a media technology company one day.It is unclear how exactly the CBS All Access service, which launched 18 months ago, is doing. The network will not disclose how many subscribers the service has, but Jefferies analyst John Janedis estimates it is around 500,000. That is a fraction of Netflix's tens of millions of viewers.Moonves believes his relative success in the digital realm may be down to the skepticism he brings from a pre-smartphone era, and not just saying yes to new ideas.""I am the old-fashioned guy,"" he said. ""My job at the company is to be Dr. No.""Looking back, he is glad CBS said no to buying a stake in online streaming service Hulu, saying his team convinced him it did not make sense and that CBS would be better off controlling its own content.""It was bold in the sense that they were not afraid of being perceived as a Luddite of a company,"" said Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser. ""It was the right decision because it did not limit their strategic choices in what could be a fast-changing business.""Moonves admits he was worried about losing ratings, upsetting the network's affiliates and cannibalizing its business with the launch of All Access, but is now fully behind it.""We are investing in the future of All Access, which we think is an important part of our future,"" he said.

266,"   By Jessica Toonkel and Anya George Tharakan  Viacom Inc (VIAB.O) CEO Philippe Dauman railed at critics of his leadership after a fifth straight quarter missing Wall Street's sales estimates on Tuesday, unnerving investors and sending the media company's shares down more than 21 percent to a five-year low. They were Dauman's first public remarks since replacing the ailing 92-year-old Sumner Redstone as executive chairman last week, an appointment that was opposed by Redstone's daughter and greeted by skepticism by some investors.""Our outlook and the facts have been distorted and obscured by the naysayers, self-interested critics and publicity seekers,"" Dauman said on a call with analysts following the results as he was questioned over his strategy. Viacom and to a lesser extent CBS, both majority-owned by Redstone, have come under scrutiny in light of Redstone's declining health, which is the subject of a lawsuit brought by one of his ex-girlfriends.Investors are increasingly concerned over Viacom's handling of its relationships with the cable and telecom companies such as Dish Network Corp (DISH.O), Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) and AT&T Inc (T.N) that pay to distribute its shows. Viacom cut its fiscal 2016 growth outlook for the fees it gets from affiliates to “low to mid single digits” from high single digits, citing numerous issues. Viacom's shares closed down 21.5 percent at $32.86 on Nasdaq, their lowest mark in almost five and a half years, shedding $3 billion in market value. They are now down more than 50 percent over the past 12 months.On the conference call on Tuesday, Dauman said Redstone and he were ""in harmony"" about the company's strategy. Redstone, who is now chairman emeritus, was on the call, according to Viacom, but did not speak.  The lack of confidence in Dauman and the range of issues he faces unsettled some.“The majority of investors think that the business or management or both are impaired,"" said Brian Wieser, a Pivotal Research analyst. “It’s almost like a big bath of concerns.""Some investors are skeptical that Dauman can turn Viacom's fortunes around. His next big test will be wrapping up talks with Dish over whether the cable operator will continue to carry Viacom's networks and at what price. Dauman said negotiations have been extended and he expects the two to reach an agreement.  Investors are also waiting for the outcome of a hearing scheduled for Feb. 25 in a New York court determining whether Dauman can be deposed as a witness in the legal dispute over Redstone's mental competence. Dauman talked about “noise,” as a factor that had been obstructing the company’s performance, an apparent reference to the legal battle over Redstone's health.  “I think his statement illustrates the level of denial that is concerning investors,” Rich Greenfield, an analyst with BTIG Research, told Reuters after the call. Dauman hinted that Viacom may take action against cable provider Comcast, which moved Spike, CMT, Pop and some other CBS networks to a higher-priced package.“They have violated our agreements and we are not going to sit back,” Dauman said, when asked if Viacom might sue. “We will preserve our rights as we go forward.”  In an emailed statement, a Comcast spokesman said the company is moving some networks to higher pay packages in response to higher programming costs.For the first quarter of its fiscal 2016, the owner of MTV, Comedy Central, Nickelodeon and movie studio Paramount reported a steeper-than-expected drop in quarterly revenue, hurt by lower advertising sales in the United States. It said domestic advertising revenue fell 4 percent, as price increases were more than offset by a decline in traditional ratings at some of Viacom's networks.  That was slightly better than the consensus among analysts, who expected a 5 percent decline. The drop was an improvement from the September quarter's 7-percent fall.    Total revenue declined 5.7 percent to $3.15 billion, below the $3.26 billion Wall Street had expected, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.     Excluding some items, Viacom earned $1.18 per share, meeting analysts' average estimate.Prior to releasing earnings, Viacom announced a deal with video messaging app provider Snapchat on Tuesday that gives Viacom exclusive rights to sell advertising around Snapchat's content.    Analysts and investors said it remains to be seen what the partnership means for Viacom, but agreed that it is a step in the right direction.“I think the stock drop is a bit of an overreaction,” said Salvatore Muoio, whose firm is one of the top holders of voting shares of Viacom. “Everything had a lot of minus signs in front of it... but I am buying today.” (Reporting by Anya George Tharakan in Bengaluru and Jessica Toonkel in New York; Additional reporting by Malathi Nayak in New York; Editing by Ted Kerr, Tiffany Wu and Bill Rigby)",2016-02-09,CBS,"Tue Feb 9, 2016 | 6:00pm EST","Viacom CEO rails against 'naysayers' as sales miss estimates, shares tumble",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-viacom-results-idUSKCN0VI122?type=companyNews

He has his work cut out for him. Shares of Viacom are down 64 percent from their peak in July 2014, a period when it was heavily repurchasing its shares.Companies frequently tout buybacks as a way of delivering value to shareholders when other investment opportunities are scarce. But Viacom spent nearly $10 billion on buybacks at a time when the company's stock was on the rise and at levels much higher than it is now. Buybacks have been criticized as a poor use of funds, particularly as many companies tend to increase their purchases as their stock price is rising, as Viacom did in this case. The company's free cash flow, a measure of financial health, has declined in the last couple of years. A recent Reuters analysis showed that many companies are spending on share repurchases at a far faster pace than they are investing in long-term growth through capital spending. At the same time, they are reducing their cash levels, only to find their financial flexibility limited in the future.Others, however, argue that with weak economic growth and lackluster demand, companies are better served by repurchasing their shares and sending cash back to shareholders rather than investments that later turn out to be unproductive. Between October 2012 and March 2015, Viacom spent about $9.7 billion on buybacks, at an average cost of $73.58 per share, based on company filings - or about 55 percent more than the current stock price now.Viacom's busiest quarter of share repurchases was in the quarter ending September 30, 2013, when it bought back about $2.7 billion in stock at an average price of about $80 a share. Viacom suspended its share repurchase program in the quarter ending June 30, 2015.

285,"   By Jessica Toonkel and Sai Sachin R  Viacom Inc (VIAB.O) is considering selling a ""significant"" minority stake in its Paramount Pictures movie studio, Chief Executive Philippe Dauman said on TuesdayIn the face of weak advertising sales and poor ratings at its cable networks, investors have been urging Viacom to sell all or part of the movie studio, saying possible buyers include Chinese firms and tech companies looking to develop original content.The entire studio, which Viacom says is in a rebuilding process after some high-profile failures, is worth $4 billion, Sanford Bernstein analyst Todd Juenger estimated this week. Viacom declined to say what percentage it might sell.Dauman, who took on the role of executive chairman from 92-year-old majority owner Sumner Redstone earlier this month, is under pressure to revive Viacom's fortunes after the company missed Wall Street earnings estimates for the fifth straight quarter, sending its stock down more than 21 percent to a five-year low.Mario Gabelli, the second-largest owner of Viacom voting shares, has suggested Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N) as a partner. Activist investor Eric Jackson, whose firm SpringOwl Asset Management has a small Viacom stake, has called for a sale of a Paramount stake to Alibaba or to Amazon, one of many tech companies expanding into developing original movies and shows.Alibaba declined to comment.A Chinese firm would be a likely buyer, analysts and investors said. Hollywood studios are also eager to work with Chinese companies to help get their films distributed in China, which limits the number of foreign films allowed into the country each year. China is the world's second-largest film market.Chinese property and investment firm Dalian Wanda Group agreed in January to acquire a majority stake in U.S. movie studio Legendary Entertainment.  Hunan TV & Broadcast Intermediary Co (000917.SZ) has provided financing to Lions Gate Entertainment Corp (LGF.N), and Huayi Brothers Media Corp (300027.SZ) produces films with STX Entertainment. Alibaba Pictures was an investor in Paramount's 2015 release ""Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation.""With the importance of China's film market growing, Hollywood studios have tailored content to increase the chances of getting movies into the country and to build their appeal to Chinese audiences.      For the fourth ""Transformers"" movie in 2014, Paramount filmed scenes in Hong Kong and mainland China and added Chinese actress Li Bingbing to the cast.Sony Corp (6758.T) changed 2015 film ""Pixels"" for global audiences, removing an attack on the Great Wall of China and other politically sensitive plot points, internal emails showed.  PARAMOUNT EXPANDING OUTPUT  Paramount, whose films this year include sequels to its ""Star Trek"" and ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" franchises, is increasing its movie output after reducing its slate in recent years and expanding into TV production. It ranked sixth among major Hollywood studios in 2015 U.S. box office receipts.Paramount reported an operating loss of $146 million for the quarter ended in December, more than double the amount a year earlier. ""Terminator: Genisys"" was among its recent box office disappointments. Viacom has been approached by several strategic investors and has retained PJT Partners as its financial adviser, Dauman said at a media conference.Given how undervalued Paramount is, it makes sense to sell a minority stake rather than the whole company, analysts noted.""If they can monetize some minority interest in this, it could be a relatively big number which would go a long way toward helping the stock price recover,"" said Salvatore Muoio, whose firm, S Muoio & Co LLC, is Viacom's 10th biggest voting shareholder.Viacom shares rose as much as 7.0 percent on Dauman's statement on Tuesday, before paring gains to close up 0.4 percent at $37.01. The stock has tumbled 47 percent in the past 12 months and 10.5 percent this year through Monday.

287,"   By Jessica Toonkel and Karen Freifeld  Viacom Inc (VIAB.O) Chief Executive Philippe Dauman's lawyers failed to persuade a New York judge to quash his deposition in a high-profile lawsuit over media mogul Sumner Redstone’s mental competency. In a hearing Thursday afternoon, New York state Supreme Court Justice Kathryn Freed ruled that a deposition of Dauman could be conducted.The ruling was the latest in a lawsuit filed in November in Los Angeles by Redstone's ex-girlfriend Manuela Herzer, who has sued over her removal as the 92-year-old Redstone's healthcare agent in favor of Dauman. She claims Redstone was not mentally competent to make that decision in October 2015.""Mr. Dauman is prepared to cooperate fully with the court and provide any relevant information in the California action,"" Dauman's attorney Leslie Fagen, of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, told reporters after the hearing. Viacom and to a lesser extent CBS Corp (CBS.N), both majority-owned by Redstone, have come under scrutiny in light of Redstone's declining health, which was highlighted by Herzer's lawsuit.As part of that lawsuit, Herzer claimed that a declaration by Dauman about discussions with Redstone was ""riddled with falsehoods"" because Redstone could not speak. Herzer also alleged that Redstone's signature had been forged on a document filed with the court. Dauman asked the state supreme court in New York, where he is based, to shield him from being forced to give the deposition, leading to the Thursday hearing.Herzer's victory on Thursday is a blow to Viacom and Redstone's case. Dauman, who took on the role of executive chairman from Redstone earlier this month, is under pressure to revive Viacom's fortunes. The company missed Wall Street earnings estimates for the fifth straight quarter this month, sending its stock down more than 21 percent to a five-year low.  The deposition will relate to conversations Dauman had with Redstone on Oct. 8 and Nov. 3. Herzer was forced out of Redstone's home on Oct. 12 and Redstone replaced Herzer with Dauman on his healthcare directive on Oct. 16. The judge asked for attorneys to try to conduct the deposition within the next 30 days. She said she did not expect it to take more than a day.Dauman's attorneys objected to any questions related to Viacom's finances. The judge agreed to restrict the questions for the deposition to what Dauman and Redstone talked about without getting into specifics about Viacom finances.  ""I don't want him to give away corporate secrets or corporate finances,"" she said. The judge said she understood there was a ""fine line"" about what questions pertaining to Viacom's finances could be asked, and said she would be available for the attorneys to contact during the deposition.

288,"  (Adds Dauman attorney statement, background, updates shares)By Jessica Toonkel and Karen FreifeldFeb 25 Viacom Inc Chief Executive Philippe Dauman's lawyers failed to persuade a New York judge to quash his deposition in a high-profile lawsuit over media mogul Sumner Redstone's mental competency.In a hearing Thursday afternoon, New York state Supreme Court Justice Kathryn Freed ruled that a deposition of Dauman could be conducted.The ruling was the latest in a lawsuit filed in November in Los Angeles by Redstone's ex-girlfriend Manuela Herzer, who has sued over her removal as the 92-year-old Redstone's healthcare agent in favor of Dauman. She claims Redstone was not mentally competent to make that decision in October 2015.""Mr. Dauman is prepared to cooperate fully with the court and provide any relevant information in the California action,"" Dauman's attorney Leslie Fagen, of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, told reporters after the hearing. Viacom and to a lesser extent CBS Corp, both majority-owned by Redstone, have come under scrutiny in light of Redstone's declining health, which was highlighted by Herzer's lawsuit.As part of that lawsuit, Herzer claimed that a declaration by Dauman about discussions with Redstone was ""riddled with falsehoods"" because Redstone could not speak. Herzer also alleged that Redstone's signature had been forged on a document filed with the court. Dauman asked the state supreme court in New York, where he is based, to shield him from being forced to give the deposition, leading to the Thursday hearing. Herzer's victory on Thursday is a blow to Viacom and Redstone's case. Dauman, who took on the role of executive chairman from Redstone earlier this month, is under pressure to revive Viacom's fortunes. The company missed Wall Street earnings estimates for the fifth straight quarter this month, sending its stock down more than 21 percent to a five-year low.The deposition will relate to conversations Dauman had with Redstone on Oct. 8 and Nov. 3. Herzer was forced out of Redstone's home on Oct. 12 and Redstone replaced Herzer with Dauman on his healthcare directive on Oct. 16.

The lawsuit has raised questions about Redstone's role in decision-making at Viacom and CBS Corp, media companies in which he controls about 80 percent of voting stock.

293,"   By Dan Levine and Lisa Richwine | LOS ANGELES  LOS ANGELES Media mogul Sumner Redstone's lawyers suffered a defeat in court on Monday as a California judge tentatively ruled that a lawsuit challenging his mental competency could proceed to trial.    The decision, by Los Angeles Superior Court Judge David Cowan, dashes an attempt by Redstone's lawyers to put a quick end to the case, which has raised questions about the 92-year-old's role in decision-making at Viacom Inc and CBS Corp. Redstone controls about 80 percent of the voting stock, though he stepped down as executive chairman at both companies earlier this month.       Redstone's former girlfriend, Manuela Herzer, claims the multibillionaire was mentally incompetent when he removed her as his designated healthcare agent in October.    Redstone suffers from a speech impairment but was fully aware of his actions when he replaced Herzer with Viacom Chief Executive Philippe Dauman as the person designated to make decisions about his medical care if he is unable, his lawyers argue.   However, the judge questioned the arrangements under which Dauman directs Redstone's care, and his ruling clears the way for an extensive exchange of documents and interviews by both sides in the runup to trial, scheduled to begin May 6. Herzer's attorneys are planning to interview Dauman under oath, as well as Shari Redstone, Sumner's daughter, who opposed Dauman replacing her father as Viacom executive chairman earlier this month.  While the judge said he could not make conclusions about Redstone's mental capacity short of trial, he did express concern at the state of Redstone's health, according to a tentative ruling distributed before a hearing on Monday in Los Angeles.California judges often issue tentative rulings, which are then finalized after a hearing with few major changes.  ""The court finds it perplexing that Redstone still puts Philippe Dauman and for that matter Thomas Dooley, the COO of Viacom, ahead of his own daughter as his agent in case of his incapacity,"" the judge wrote in the ruling. ""It has to be an unusual situation where a parent still at this late date puts his East Coast business colleagues ahead of an adult child, or for that matter adult grandchildren, in terms of his care.""     The judge questioned how a CEO in New York, such as Dauman, had the ""time or ability"" to look after Redstone in California, even with the best intentions. DOCTORS' VIEWS DIFFER Redstone's lawyers argue that Herzer is merely seeking financial gain after Redstone's move in October to revoke a part of his estate plan that would have given Herzer a $70 million inheritance.   After the hearing, Redstone's attorneys said in a statement they are ""confident"" the court will ultimately determine he had the capacity to decide that Herzer ""should have no role in his life whatsoever.""   The judge noted an opinion provided by Stephen Read, a psychiatrist hired by Herzer, who has examined Redstone. He did not discuss details of Read's report, but said: ""Suffice it to say, though not conclusive as to capacity, but those details are difficult to read in describing how this man is hanging on to life.""  Read has stated in court filings that he believes Redstone lacked the mental capacity to change his healthcare directive.  Redstone's personal physician, Richard Gold, and psychiatrist James Spar have told the court they believe the mogul was competent to make that decision.   The judge on Monday also highlighted evidence suggesting ""an ongoing feud"" between Redstone's nurses. One nurse accused another of telling Redstone that Herzer ""had lied to and stolen"" from him, the judge wrote. That may have led to Herzer's forced ejection from Redstone's house, according to evidence presented by Herzer, cited by the judge.However, the judge said it is unclear whether the nurse's accusation is merely the creation of a disgruntled employee who is jealous of the lucrative hours worked by his colleague. Gabrielle Vidal, a lawyer for Redstone, said at Monday's hearing that Redstone's privacy is being ""eviscerated"" by the legal proceedings, and that Redstone just wanted to live in peace, without litigation.The judge said it was difficult to understand what Redstone wanted. ""Unfortunately I have no declaration from him, I have no evidence from him,"" the judge said in the hearing. After the hearing, Herzer attorney Pierce O'Donnell said Redstone was being ""preyed upon"" by those around him.""The evidence is clear, and we will prove at trial (that) Sumner Redstone is marooned and a prisoner of his home,"" O'Donnell said.Shari Redstone, in a statement, said Herzer had reached a ""new low"" with an ""unfounded"" claim that ""Shari's devotion to her father is motivated by money or power, not love.""The family has no financial interest in the case, the statement said. Redstone redirected Herzer's inheritance to charity, his lawyers have said in court documents.Viacom shares rose 1.7 percent to close at $36.85 on the Nasdaq on Monday.

Dauman replied that he did not seek to be put in charge of Redstone's health care and said Redstone ""is getting the absolute best in medical care and enjoying life.""As for the company, Dauman said it was investing in a number of initiatives including programming, data analytics and its international business as it seeks to turn around its performance.""This is an exciting time for Viacom and we are confident in our strategy,"" he said. ""Many of our initiatives we have discussed will take time to bear fruit... but others already are.""Last month, Dauman replaced Redstone as executive chairman of Viacom. Redstone is now chairman emeritus.Days after Redstone stepped down, Institutional Shareholder Service, which advises big institutional investors on how to vote their shares in corporate elections, recommended that Viacom shareholders withhold support for six of the media company's directors.Sal Muoio, whose investment firm also is a top owner of voting Viacom shares, declined to comment on how he voted, but he questioned the value of a dual-class structure at Viacom.""If the company were open to selling... having a single-class structure does help them negotiate for the highest price,"" Muoio said.

304,"   By Jessica Toonkel  Viacom Inc is looking to name a lead independent director, most likely one of its existing board members, and could make an announcement within the next few days, two sources familiar with the situation told Reuters, as the media company faces investor questions about its corporate governance.The move comes a little over a month after Viacom's board voted to make CEO Philippe Dauman executive chair, replacing 92-year-old media mogul Sumner Redstone, over the dissent of Redstone's daughter, who said the chair needed to be an ""independent voice.""It has become standard corporate governance practice for companies that have combined the CEO and chair position to have a lead independent director, according to Kevin McManus, vice president at independent proxy adviser Egan Jones.A Viacom spokesman declined to comment. The company has not previously designated a lead independent director on its 11-member board.The lead independent director would likely be an existing independent board member, according to the sources, who asked not to be named because they are not permitted to speak to the media. It was not clear who the director would be. There are currently seven directors classified as independent on Viacom's board, including Frederic Salerno, formerly vice chairman and chief financial officer at Verizon Communications Inc and chair of the board's compensation committee, and Charles Phillips, chief executive of New York-based software company Infor, who is also a member of the board's compensation committee.In the role of lead independent director, the person would  help the board handle sensitive issues over which Dauman might be conflicted, such as discussing his performance and compensation, said McManus. Viacom has been criticized for Dauman's high compensation package, paying him $54.2 million for the fiscal year ended Sept 30, 2015, up from $44.3 million in the previous year. During the most recent fiscal year the company's shares fell 44 percent.The New York-based company has faced questions from investors about its corporate governance.Proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services recommended that Viacom investors withhold support earlier this week for six of the company's directors at its annual shareholder meeting, citing several concerns including their oversight of executive compensation.On Monday, shareholders voted to re-elect all of Viacom's directors despite the recommendation.",2016-03-16,CBS,"Wed Mar 16, 2016 | 12:45pm EDT",Viacom looks to name lead independent director to board,http://www.reuters.com//article/viacom-independentdirector-idUSL2N16O1EG?type=companyNews
305,"   By Jessica Toonkel  Viacom Inc (VIAB.O) has extended the employment agreement of Chief Operating Officer Thomas Dooley through 2018, settling uncertainty over whether the executive would stay with the multi-billion dollar media company 10 months before his current contract was set to expire.Under the new agreement, announced on Thursday, Dooley will see no change in his compensation, according to a filing with securities regulators. In fiscal 2015, his pay fell to $29.4 million from $35 million the previous year. Dooley's contract is now in line with those of Viacom Chief Executive and Chair Philippe Dauman and Chief Financial Officer Wade Davis, whose contracts also run to the end of 2018. Details of the employment agreement will be disclosed after Viacom releases second-quarter earnings in April, said the New York-based media company, which owns MTV, Nickelodeon and Paramount.The existing agreement with Dooley, who was named COO in 2010, was set to expire on Dec. 31 this year, causing some uncertainty over his future. Dooley and Dauman have worked closely for over 30 years. They left Viacom together in 2000, when Viacom merged with CBS, to run a private equity firm. Six years later, when Viacom spun off CBS, Dauman and Dooley returned to Viacom with Dauman as CEO and Dooley as chief administrative officer. He was promoted to CFO in 2007 and to COO in 2010. Viacom's inner workings have come under increasing scrutiny over the past two years in light of the declining health of 92-year-old majority owner Sumner Redstone. The media mogul's mental competence is the subject of a lawsuit brought by one of his former girlfriends. Last month, Dauman replaced Redstone as Viacom's executive chair.

He replaced Sumner Redstone despite calls by the 92-year-old media mogul's daughter for an ""independent voice"" in that position.Roughly a quarter of the independent shares voted was in opposition to Salerno's reelection to the board on Monday, the lowest level of support among board members. But overall, investors cheered the move on Wednesday, and Viacom's stock rose 3.7 percent.Salerno told Reuters he wanted to ensure Viacom's independent directors had a good handle on every aspect of Viacom's business, including mergers and acquisition activity. Last month, Dauman said the company was looking to sell a ""significant stake"" in Paramount.""The priorities are that we clearly understand the strategic plan that exists and to make sure it's holistic enough for each and everyone of the directors to not only understand it but to be able to input their views as to the doability [and] the appropriateness,"" he said in an interview on Wednesday after the announcement.""We will make sure that we represent all shareholders, which is important in a controlled company,"" he added. Proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services recommended that Viacom investors withhold support for six of the company's directors, including Salerno, who chairs the compensation committee, citing concerns about executive pay. Viacom awarded Dauman a $54.2 million pay package for the last fiscal year, when the company's shares fell 44 percent.Salerno noted that much of the compensation was in equity tied to business performance, not cash. He disputed the perception that the board was in some way beholden to Dauman.""It is a high number in comparison to the industry. No one denies that, but it's a number that is not high in comparison to the peer group,"" he said. About 80 percent of Viacom's Class A voting shares are owned by Redstone's family, a level of control that Paul Hodgson, a partner at PHJ Partners, a Portland, Maine-based corporate governance consultancy, said undermined Salerno's independence.""His actual level of independence is probably questionable,"" Hodgson said.Salerno drew 96 percent support from all shares voted at the annual meeting this week, in line with typical levels for uncontested directors at S&P 500 companies, according to several analyses.But his support among outside investors was roughly 76 percent of shares voted, a level corporate governance consultant Francis Byrd said should be taken as a sign of discontent among the independent shareholders. “There’s a significant minority of shareholders who do not feel that Salerno adequately represents them,” Byrd said.Salerno, who noted that a majority of independent shareholders supported him, said he saw his new role as ""a matter of refinement"" rather than ""revolutionizing"" the board. The appointment of an independent lead director could help quell investor concern surrounding Viacom after Redstone's ex-girlfriend Manuela Herzer filed a lawsuit questioning his mental competence when he removed her last year as his health care agent in favor of Dauman.

The companies have been in talks for several months over whether Dish would continue to carry Viacom's networks, and at what price. The lack of a new contract could lead to a blackout of Viacom programming on Dish's network of about 14 million subscribers.Viacom has been struggling to turn around sagging ratings and many investors and analysts see the Dish contract as a major indicator of the company's progress. If Dish walks away from Viacom for good, other distributors may follow suit, analysts said.Wall Street has been viewing the talks with Dish as the first test for Viacom Chief Executive Philippe Dauman, an attorney known for his negotiating prowess, since he replaced Sumner Redstone as executive chair in February.Dauman has said the negotiations had been extended and that he expected an agreement with Dish next quarter.A blackout with Dish could result in a 15 percent hit to the media company's affiliate revenue, analyst Brian Wieser of Pivotal Research Group estimated. Similarly, ad revenue for Viacom's networks could shrink by 15 percent if Dish walks away from Viacom altogether, he said. Viacom went public with the potential blackout at midday Tuesday, stating it was ""extremely disappointed that Dish has not engaged in a serious way to reach an agreement."" The New York-based media company started running a crawl across the screen on all of its networks alerting Dish customers of the potential blackout.Dish, whose shares rose 1.9 percent, fired back at Viacom.""We regret that Viacom has chosen to involve customers in a business negotiation when time remains to reach an agreement,"" Dish said in a statement. ""Viacom unilaterally elected to terminate an indefinite contract extension tomorrow night despite meaningful progress on a new agreement that confronts a rapidly evolving pay-TV environment.""If Dish walks away from Viacom, it would join smaller cable operators Suddenlink Communications [CQUELS.UL] and Cable One Inc (CABO.N), which dropped Viacom last year.Dish CEO Charlie Ergen, a former professional poker player, has locked horns with big networks such as CBS Corp (CBS.N) and Time Warner Inc's (TWX.N) Turner Broadcasting on distribution deals, even as his satellite-TV company tackles subscriber losses. Ergen, in recent earnings calls, has pointed out Viacom's waning viewership and said viewers could find alternatives to the network's kids content on YouTube and Netflix (NFLX.O). Analysts said they believed a deal would ultimately get done. Often carriage agreements are signed at the last minute.""I think Viacom can't really afford not to do the deal with Dish and Dish knows this and is negotiating aggressively,"" said Doug Creutz, an analyst with Cowen and Co. ""But at the end of the day I am not sure Dish can afford to be without Viacom either because while their ratings are down, they are still a very watched group of networks.""Seventy-six percent of U.S. viewers watched at least one Viacom network in February, Wieser of Pivotal Research said.Dish is scheduled to report quarterly earnings on Wednesday.

If Dish walks away from Viacom for good, other distributors may follow suit, analysts said.Wall Street has been viewing the talks with Dish as the first test for Viacom Chief Executive Philippe Dauman, an attorney known for his negotiating prowess, since he replaced Sumner Redstone as executive chair in February.Dauman has said the negotiations had been extended and that he expected an agreement with Dish next quarter.A blackout with Dish could result in a 15 percent hit to the media company's affiliate revenue, analyst Brian Wieser of Pivotal Research Group estimated. Similarly, ad revenue for Viacom's networks could shrink by 15 percent if Dish walks away from Viacom altogether, he said. Viacom went public with the potential blackout at midday Tuesday, stating it was ""extremely disappointed that Dish has not engaged in a serious way to reach an agreement."" The New York-based media company started running a crawl across the screen on all of its networks alerting Dish customers of the potential blackout.Dish, whose shares rose 1.9 percent, fired back at Viacom.""We regret that Viacom has chosen to involve customers in a business negotiation when time remains to reach an agreement,"" Dish said in a statement. ""Viacom unilaterally elected to terminate an indefinite contract extension tomorrow night despite meaningful progress on a new agreement that confronts a rapidly evolving pay-TV environment.""If Dish walks away from Viacom, it would join smaller cable operators Suddenlink Communications [CQUELS.UL] and Cable One Inc (CABO.N), which dropped Viacom last year.Dish CEO Charlie Ergen, a former professional poker player, has locked horns with big networks such as CBS Corp (CBS.N) and Time Warner Inc's (TWX.N) Turner Broadcasting on distribution deals, even as his satellite-TV company tackles subscriber losses. Ergen, in recent earnings calls, has pointed out Viacom's waning viewership and said viewers could find alternatives to the network's kids content on YouTube and Netflix (NFLX.O). Analysts said they believed a deal would ultimately get done. Often carriage agreements are signed at the last minute.""I think Viacom can't really afford not to do the deal with Dish and Dish knows this and is negotiating aggressively,"" said Doug Creutz, an analyst with Cowen and Co. ""But at the end of the day I am not sure Dish can afford to be without Viacom either because while their ratings are down, they are still a very watched group of networks.""Seventy-six percent of U.S. viewers watched at least one Viacom network in February, Wieser of Pivotal Research said.Dish is scheduled to report quarterly earnings on Wednesday.

317,"   By Jessica Toonkel and Malathi Nayak  Dish Network Corp Chief Executive Charlie Ergen said on Wednesday that talks to renew the satellite TV provider's contract to carry Viacom Inc programs have turned positive, though a deal remains uncertain ahead of a midnight deadline.""As a long-standing partner, we are hopeful that we can work together to reach a deal,"" Viacom responded in an emailed statement.Viacom shares rose 1.5 percent on the comments, after falling more than 1 percent earlier on Wednesday. Dish shares were barely changed.The companies have been in talks for several months over whether Dish would continue to carry Viacom's 18 channels and at what price. A blackout would block Dish's 14 million subscribers' access to Viacom shows such as ""Broad City"" on Comedy Central and ""SpongeBob SquarePants"" on Nickelodeon.""Over the past 24 hours, hundreds of thousands of concerned subscribers have reached out to implore DISH to negotiate reasonable terms with Viacom for continued carriage of our networks,"" Viacom said.""Based on year-to-date Nielsen data, our networks represent nearly one fifth of cable viewership on Dish, which gives Dish enormous incentive to renew our agreement."" Billionaire investor Mario Gabelli, who has the largest voting share in Viacom behind former Executive Chairman Sumner Redstone's family, told Reuters earlier on Wednesday that he expected a 10-day blackout after the current contract expires at midnight.Dish had in recent months offered Viacom a rolling short-term extension and was ""prepared to move on"" without Viacom programming if no agreement is reached, Ergen told investors on a conference call after reporting quarterly earnings.The talks have turned more productive since the weekend, he said.  The negotiations are being held as Dish tackles subscriber losses and Viacom tries to turn around sagging viewership ratings, as online video services such as Netflix Inc and Hulu have become more popular.In an e-mail to Reuters, Gabelli said he hoped that once the contract is renewed, Viacom's management would turn its attention to selling a minority stake in its Paramount movie studio.Dish, whose last distribution deal with Viacom was in 2009, declined to comment on Gabelli's comments. Viacom on Tuesday warned Dish subscribers that they might soon lose access to its channels, including MTV, if no agreement is reached by the deadline.Ergen, known to be a tough negotiator, has locked horns with big networks such as CBS Corp and Time Warner Inc's Turner Broadcasting on distribution deals.Seventy-five percent of Dish's negotiations with content providers have led to temporary blackouts, according to a J.P. Morgan report published Tuesday.

""If Dish had cut Viacom and only saw modest subscriber losses it would have emboldened other distributors with other networks,"" he said. ""No one is paying attention to Cable One or SuddenLink Communications [CQUELS.UL], but they do pay attention to Charlie Ergen.""Cable One and Sudden Link, which are smaller cable operators, dropped Viacom programming last year.In the past year Viacom had penned distribution agreements with AT&T, Charter Communications and other cable companies, whose subscribers total more than 44 million, Viacom said.""In 2017 and beyond, these deals will drive Viacom's annual affiliate fee growth with our traditional distribution partners at solid mid-single-digit rates,"" the company wrote in an e-mailed statement.

324,"   By Jessica Toonkel and Liana B. Baker | NEW YORK  NEW YORK CBS Corp's executives are talking to investment bankers about how their CEO and executive chairman, Les Moonves, can gain more control over the broadcaster after Sumner Redstone dies, or if he is declared mentally incompetent, said two sources familiar with the situation.The New York-based company met with investment banks in recent months to discuss how it could buy CBS's voting shares from Redstone's National Amusements Inc, and collapse CBS's dual-class share structure, the sources told Reuters.CBS and Viacom Inc both have dual-class share structures with 80 percent of their voting shares owned by National Amusements, a privately-held movie theater company controlled by the 92-year-old Redstone.A seven-person trust, which includes Redstone's daughter Shari Redstone and Viacom CEO Philippe Dauman, will take over the voting shares owned by National Amusements when the ailing billionaire dies.The trust may also take control if Redstone is declared mentally incompetent as a result of a lawsuit brought by his former girlfriend in California.CBS, home to such shows as ""The Big Bang Theory"" and ""The Good Wife"" and premium TV channel Showtime, wants to review all of its options before the trust takes over, the sources said. The discussions, which have not previously been reported, are preliminary and ongoing, said the two sources, who did not want to be identified because they are not permitted to speak to the media. Another person familiar with the situation said CBS has not formally hired an investment bank to review its options.CBS declined to comment. A spokeswoman for Shari Redstone, who sits on the boards of CBS and National Amusements, also declined comment.Uncertainty about Redstone's health has weighed on the shares of both CBS and Viacom. Redstone, who turns 93 next month, has not participated in a quarterly earnings call since 2014.While Viacom's future and the drama surrounding the lawsuit have garnered more attention on Wall Street, CBS has been exploring its options for some time, the sources said. CBS has had more serious conversations with bankers in recent months as concerns about Redstone's health have increased, they added.Moonves became executive chairman of CBS in February, with the blessing of Shari Redstone.A single-class share structure is believed to better reflect CBS's value, analysts and investors have said. But any offer CBS might make for the voting shares would have to be rich enough for National Amusements and other voting shareholders to accept. ""It would eliminate some of the uncertainty around the ownership and it gives Moonves greater control over his destiny,"" said one owner of voting shares of CBS, who asked to remain anonymous because he is not permitted to speak to the media. ""I think it would trade better if it were one shareholder, one vote.""In September, Reuters Breakingviews estimated that ending the dual class structure at CBS  could lift the U.S. broadcaster's value by a fifthWhether voting shareholders of CBS would accept a deal to exchange their shares would depend on the terms, said Michael Cuggino, president and portfolio manager at San Francisco-based Permanent Portfolio of Family of Funds, which owns voting shares of CBS.""I am open,"" Cuggino said. ""I would be interested in seeing what the offer is.""The lawsuit by Redstone's former girlfriend, Manuela Herzer, questions his mental competence and claims Redstone is a ""living ghost.""

331,"   By Jessica Toonkel and Liana B. Baker | NEW YORK  NEW YORK CBS Corp's executives are talking to investment bankers about how their CEO and executive chairman, Les Moonves, can gain more control over the broadcaster after Sumner Redstone dies, or if he is declared mentally incompetent, said two sources familiar with the situation.The New York-based company met with investment banks in recent months to discuss how it could buy CBS's voting shares from Redstone's National Amusements Inc, and collapse CBS's dual-class share structure, the sources told Reuters.CBS and Viacom Inc both have dual-class share structures with 80 percent of their voting shares owned by National Amusements, a privately-held movie theater company controlled by the 92-year-old Redstone.A seven-person trust, which includes Redstone's daughter Shari Redstone and Viacom CEO Philippe Dauman, will take over the voting shares owned by National Amusements when the ailing billionaire dies.The trust may also take control if Redstone is declared mentally incompetent as a result of a lawsuit brought by his former girlfriend in California.CBS, home to such shows as ""The Big Bang Theory"" and ""The Good Wife"" and premium TV channel Showtime, wants to review all of its options before the trust takes over, the sources said. The discussions, which have not previously been reported, are preliminary and ongoing, said the two sources, who did not want to be identified because they are not permitted to speak to the media. Another person familiar with the situation said CBS has not formally hired an investment bank to review its options. CBS declined to comment. A spokeswoman for Shari Redstone, who sits on the boards of CBS and National Amusements, also declined comment.Uncertainty about Redstone's health has weighed on the shares of both CBS and Viacom. Redstone, who turns 93 next month, has not participated in a quarterly earnings call since 2014.While Viacom's future and the drama surrounding the lawsuit have garnered more attention on Wall Street, CBS has been exploring its options for some time, the sources said. CBS has had more serious conversations with bankers in recent months as concerns about Redstone's health have increased, they added.  Moonves became executive chairman of CBS in February, with the blessing of Shari Redstone.  A single-class share structure is believed to better reflect CBS's value, analysts and investors have said. But any offer CBS might make for the voting shares would have to be rich enough for National Amusements and other voting shareholders to accept. ""It would eliminate some of the uncertainty around the ownership and it gives Moonves greater control over his destiny,"" said one owner of voting shares of CBS, who asked to remain anonymous because he is not permitted to speak to the media. ""I think it would trade better if it were one shareholder, one vote.""  In September, Reuters Breakingviews estimated that ending the dual class structure at CBS  could lift the U.S. broadcaster's value by a fifthWhether voting shareholders of CBS would accept a deal to exchange their shares would depend on the terms, said Michael Cuggino, president and portfolio manager at San Francisco-based Permanent Portfolio of Family of Funds, which owns voting shares of CBS.""I am open,"" Cuggino said. ""I would be interested in seeing what the offer is.""The lawsuit by Redstone's former girlfriend, Manuela Herzer, questions his mental competence and claims Redstone is a ""living ghost."" It is set for trial on May 6. Redstone's attorneys deny Herzer's claims and say she is seeking financial gain after Redstone revoked a part of his estate plan that would have given her a $70 million inheritance.

336,"   By Lisa Richwine | LOS ANGELES  LOS ANGELES Even as a Los Angeles judge dismissed one case brought by a former girlfriend of media mogul Sumner Redstone, she filed a new lawsuit that threatens to keep salacious allegations about the 92-year-old's lifestyle alive.The new complaint, filed by Manuela Herzer, 52, in Los Angeles Superior Court on Monday, alleges that Redstone's daughter Shari interfered with the inheritance Herzer was due to receive in his will and invaded her privacy.A spokeswoman for Shari Redstone called Herzer's new allegations a ""baseless attack.""""It is total fiction and continues to speak volumes about Herzer's motivation and character,"" she said.The lawsuit asserts that Shari Redstone, during a period when she was estranged from her father, assembled a network of ""nurse-informers"" within his Beverly Hills mansion to report on his activities and turn the elder Redstone against Herzer. Shari Redstone paid one of the nurses $10,000 for sending her information, the lawsuit said, adding that the same nurse was fired by Sumner Redstone for unrelated reasons.""Shari organized and implemented what would eventually become a successful campaign to turn Sumner against Herzer and strip Herzer not only of her role as his health care agent, but also of her inheritance,"" the lawsuit said.Herzer, 52, filed the new legal action shortly after a California judge tossed her case seeking to be reinstated as the person designated to make his medical decisions if he was incapacitated. She had argued that Redstone was not mentally competent and had been the victim of ""undue influence"" by people around him. A representative for Sumner Redstone, controlling shareholder of Viacom Inc and CBS Corp, had no comment on Herzer's latest legal move.Herzer's lawsuit, which seeks at least $70 million in damages, argues that the nurses violated medical privacy laws as part of a conspiracy that started in September 2014. It also says that one of the nurses, Jeremy Jagiello, controlled Sumner Redstone's access ""to his favorite paid 'escort.'""The woman received at least $7 million from Sumner Redstone, the lawsuit said, including an upfront payment, a house and $4,500 a month in cash that was left for her at the guard gate to his mansion.Jagiello arranged the woman's visits ""and even stayed in the room with Sumner during his intimate encounters"" with her, the lawsuit said.

In response, Shari Redstone said in a statement on Saturday: ""I fully support my father's decisions and respect his authority to make them.""Reuters reported on Tuesday that Redstone, who turns 93 next week, had the power to remove certain members of his trust, including Dauman. Sumner Redstone removed Dauman and Abrams as trustees and directors of his privately held movie theater company National Amusements Inc after he expressed concerns about Viacom's performance to them and received no response, according to a statement from Michael C.

349,"   By Jessica Toonkel  The legal battle over control of Sumner Redstone's $40 billion media empire has investors hopeful that change will come to underperforming Viacom Inc (VIAB.O).On Friday, Sumner Redstone removed both Viacom CEO Philippe Dauman and Viacom board member George Abrams from the trust that will determine the future of CBS and Viacom after controlling shareholder Redstone dies or is declared mentally incapacitated.Dauman fired back on Monday saying the moves to replace him and Abrams from both the trust and National Amusements board would amount to an ""unlawful corporate takeover"" by Sumner's daughter, Shari Redstone. Sumner Redstone's privately-held movie theater chain National Amusements holds 80 percent of the voting stock in both Viacom and CBS.Separately, Sumner Redstone on Monday asked a Los Angeles Court for an order validating his removal of Dauman and Abrams from his trust and from the board of National Amusements Inc.The outcome of the court cases, and who ends up with control over the trust, and over the National Amusements board, will have wide-ranging implications for Viacom and CBS shareholders and could result in changes at the top of both companies, possibly through mergers and acquisitions.  Some investors are hopeful that change is imminent. Viacom shares rose 2.5 percent to $40.02 on Monday. “This whole company should be a case study of how to destroy shareholder value,” said Salvatore Muoio, principal with New York-based S. Muoio & Co, a major owner of Viacom voting shares. “They should sell this business to the highest bidder and get it over with.”Michael Cuggino, president and portfolio manager at San Francisco-based Permanent Portfolio Family of Funds, which owns voting shares of CBS and Viacom, said he would also welcome some change at Viacom, including a sale, but had concerns about what kind of premium Viacom could get from a potential buyer right now. Cuggino said he would welcome the idea of Viacom becoming part of CBS again, but would need to make sure it made sense for CBS. Viacom spun off CBS in 2006.""There are certainly a lot of good synergies there,"" he said.Others investors are showing more patience. Mario Gabelli, the second-largest owner of Viacom voting shares, told CNBC on Monday that Dauman has six months to turn the company around.Representatives for CBS and Viacom declined to comment.Viacom, like other media companies, has suffered from falling ratings at its cable networks such as Nickelodeon and MTV as younger viewers migrate online and to mobile video.  Over the past 12 months, Viacom is down 40 percent, lagging the Standard & Poor's 500 Media Index .SPLRCME, which is off only 4.7 percent. CBS shares edged down 0.5 percent to $52.49.BATTLE FOR CONTROL  Redstone, who turns 93 on Friday, suffers from diminished mental capacity and is dependent on his daughter, Shari Redstone, the lawsuit said. ""Shari Redstone is attempting to illegally hijack her father's well-established estate plan,"" Dauman said in a statement. The complaint named Shari Redstone, her son Tyler Korff, as defendants and trust members David Andelman, Norman Jacobs and Leonard Lewin as nominal defendants.     A statement sent on behalf of Shari Redstone said, “It is absurd for anyone to accuse Shari of manipulating her father ... Sumner makes his own decisions regarding whom he wants to see both in his home and elsewhere."" Redstone's attorneys have said he made the changes to the trust and board after trying to reach out to Viacom's board to discuss the future strategy of the company.The California and Massachusetts courts will need to sort out which of them has jurisdiction, and that may not be easy, said Keith Davidson, a probate lawyer in California.“Massachusetts will likely have a strong preference to let California take jurisdiction, especially since a part of the case has already been litigated here. But you never know,” Davidson wrote in an email.The standards for determining that someone is not mentally competent differ. California requires evidence of a mental defect that correlates to the specifics of the situation, such as a will or contract; Massachusetts does not have that requirement but does look to expert opinion and would evaluate a person’s ability to manage affairs effectively, lawyers said. Viacom said in a statement its board has tried to meet with Sumner Redstone many times, adding that he was silent during a recent call about the company's strategy.Sumner Redstone has not participated in an earnings conference call or an annual investor meeting since 2014. Sumner Redstone plans to name National Amusements general counsel Tad Jankowski and family friend Jill Krutick to the trust, sources told Reuters on Sunday.     Besides Shari, trust members include her son, lawyer Tyler Korff; David Andelman, another lawyer who is on the CBS board; Norman Jacobs, Sumner Redstone's divorce lawyer; and Leonard Lewin, who represented Redstone's first wife, Phyllis, in her divorce from Redstone.'LIVING GHOST'    Sumner Redstone and Dauman have worked together for more than 30 years, and Redstone has called Dauman ""a great friend.""In February, Shari Redstone was the only one to vote against Dauman's elevation to executive chairman of Viacom to replace her father.This month, a judge dismissed a lawsuit by a former girlfriend who had argued Redstone was not mentally competent to remove her from his advance healthcare directive.The case, which claimed that Redstone was “a living ghost,” shined a spotlight on Redstone's health.The mogul struggled to speak when questioned by attorneys. But he was clear about wanting ex-girlfriend Manuela Herzer out of his life, and putting his daughter in charge of healthcare decisions if he could no longer make them. In that trial, Dauman submitted statements in November that Redstone was “engaged and attentive” in recent conversations. However, the complaint filed Monday claims that Redstone suffers from dementia, impaired cognition, a slowness of mental processing, a loss of memory, apathy and depression.

He also named Krutick and his oldest granddaughter Kimberlee Ostheimer to the board of National Amusements.Reuters reported on Sunday that Redstone, who will turn 93 on Friday, would add Jankowski and Krutick to his trust, citing sources familiar with the situation.“This is my trust and my decision. I have picked those who are loyal to me and removed those who are not,” Redstone said in his statement. The move comes after media mogul Redstone announced last week the removal of Viacom CEO Philippe Dauman and Viacom board member George Abrams from the seven-person trust and as directors of National Amusements. Dauman sued on Monday to stop Redstone, who ran Viacom for decades, from removing him and longtime director Abrams.With the addition of Krutick and Jankowski, who has worked with Redstone's National Amusements since 1982, the trust appears to give Redstone's daughter, Shari Redstone, control to determine the fate of her father's $40 billion media empire.

In the email, Salerno outlined a four-point agenda for meeting, which included ""greetings and pleasantries about our shared experiences over decades together as colleagues,"" as well as a question and answer session to get Redstone's thoughts a  the board strategy meeting held last week. That meeting included discussion about the possible sale of a stake in movie studio Paramount Pictures.Michael Tu, Redstone's attorney, said Redstone was considering the meeting request.Salerno could not be reached for comment. Viacom CEO Dauman is looking to sell a minority stake in Paramount, and has said he expects to announce a deal in June, while Sumner Redstone has voiced concern about a sale, according to sources.Redstone has a speech impairment that hinders his ability to communicate. He struggled to speak when questioned by attorneys in the California lawsuit that was dismissed earlier this month, according to a transcript of his testimony.Separately, Sumner Redstone asked a Los Angeles Court on Monday for an order validating his removal of Dauman and Abrams from his trust and from the board of National Amusements Inc. Viacom shares ended up 1.3 percent, or 54 cents, at $42.53 on the New York Stock Exchange.

359,"  (Adds more quotes from Salerno's letter, background)By Jessica Toonkel and Chuck MikolajczakNEW YORK May 30 Viacom Inc's six independent directors vowed on Monday to fight any attempt to oust them from the board, saying they found ""inexplicable"" the assertion that controlling shareholder Sumner Redstone was mentally competent and acted of his own free will.In a letter to shareholders, Lead Independent Director Fred Salerno said the directors would legally contest any bid to remove them, the latest salvo in an increasingly public and bitter battle for control of Viacom at a time when the U.S. media company needs to focus on turning its business around.The letter came three days after a statement from Redstone, issued by his spokesman, that said the 93-year-old media mogul was considering ousting Viacom Chief Executive Philippe Dauman and the board of directors.Salerno made no mention of Dauman in his letter, but said the independent directors have tried to meet face-to-face with Redstone for several weeks and have been turned away.Writing on behalf of six of Viacom's 11 board members, Salerno said, ""we feel the responsibility to challenge in court what we honestly believe would be legally flawed removals.""""That is especially so because the flaw we see would be the inexplicable assertion that Sumner was acting of his own free will and with the mental competency to do so,"" he wrote. A spokesman for Redstone declined to comment.Redstone holds 80 percent of the voting shares in Viacom and CBS Corp. Earlier this month, he removed Dauman and Viacom board member George Abrams from the seven-person trust that will control the shares after Redstone exits.Dauman, 62, has filed a legal challenge to that move, arguing that Redstone was being manipulated by his daughter, Shari. She has called that allegation ""absurd"" and said her father made his own decisions.Solerno's letter called a replacement of the independent directors ""completely inconsistent with Sumner's lifetime commitment to an independent Board"" and ""equally inconsistent with his stated judgment for many years that his daughter, Shari, should not control Viacom or his other companies."" A spokeswoman for Shari Redstone declined to comment.UNHAPPY PERFORMANCE  Shares of Viacom have fallen more than 50 percent in the past two years as its cable networks, including MTV and Nickelodeon, suffered from falling ratings because younger viewers were migrating online and to mobile video. Viacom's U.S. advertising revenue has declined for seven straight quarters .Salerno said the directors were not happy with Viacom's current performance, and they were ""very focused"" on improving it and on ""the need for management to drive it.""He added that they intend to continue with plans to ""explore strategic options that might include a minority investment in Paramount,"" Viacom's movie studio.Questions about Redstone's health have swirled since one of his former girlfriends, Manuela Herzer, filed a lawsuit last year arguing that he was not mentally competent to remove her from his advance healthcare directive.The case, which claimed that Redstone was ""a living ghost,"" was dismissed earlier this month. The mogul had struggled to speak when questioned by attorneys, but he was clear about wanting Herzer out of his life and putting his daughter in charge of healthcare decisions if he could no longer make them.Since Redstone removed Dauman from the trust on May 20, Viacom shares have risen more than 13 percent, a move that some investors saw as the first step in a change in management that could eventually lead to a sale of the media company.A hearing on whether Dauman's case should be expedited is scheduled in Massachusetts on June 7, after he filed a petition to have the trial date moved up.

NAI holds 80 percent of the voting shares in Viacom and CBS Corp (CBS.N). The ousted directors could petition a Delaware judge to issue a ""status quo"" order that keeps them on the board while the case is being litigated. Such orders are somewhat easier to obtain than a formal injunction in other kinds of civil cases, Hamermesh said.However, status quo orders are meant to last only a few weeks. A Delaware judge would likely be reluctant to delve into questions about Redstone's mental competency when that issue is already being litigated in other courts, said Minor Myers, a corporate law professor at Brooklyn Law School.""It appears to be an uphill battle,"" Myers said.

She had sought to be reinstated as his designated healthcare agent, but a Los Angeles judge dismissed that case in May.On Wednesday, O'Donnell said in a statement that he might ask for a new trial. He said a lawsuit filed by Viacom Chief Executive Philippe Dauman included ""material new evidence"" that was unavailable at the time of the trial.Dauman's lawsuit challenges his removal from the seven-person trust that would control Sumner Redstone's controlling stake in Viacom and CBS Corp when Redstone dies or is found incompetent.Keryn Redstone, who supported Herzer's lawsuit, said in her statement that she affectionately called her grandfather ""Grumpy."" She said the last time she saw him was for 15 minutes on Valentine's Day, and described how she ""quietly sobbed"" as she held his ""cold hand."" ""As he sat there lifeless and flanked by his nurses and caretakers, he seemed unaware of his surroundings,"" Keryn Redstone said.She added, ""I cry myself to sleep every night knowing that I might never see him again.""She said she was prevented from seeing him again by her aunt, Shari Redstone, who is vice chair of Viacom's board.A spokeswoman for Shari Redstone had no comment. She had previously denied allegations that she was manipulating her father. ""Shari has made it abundantly clear that she has no desire to manage Viacom nor chair its board,"" she said in a statement on Tuesday. Sumner Redstone, in a statement issued last week by his spokesman, said he was considering replacing Viacom's CEO and its board of directors.Legal experts said Dauman and the directors would face a tough legal battle to prevent their ouster because Redstone's National Amusements Inc (NAI) had the ability to immediately remove Viacom's board at any time under Delaware law.NAI controls 80 percent of the voting shares in Viacom and CBS Corp.  Shares of Viacom have lost about half their value in the past two years as its cable networks, including MTV and Nickelodeon, suffered from falling ratings because younger viewers were migrating online and to mobile video.The shares have risen about 14 percent since Redstone removed Dauman from the trust on May 20, a move that some investors saw as the first step in a change in management that could eventually lead to a sale of the media company.Dauman, in the legal challenge to his removal from the trust, argues that Redstone was being manipulated by his daughter.

383,"  NEW YORK Viacom's Chief Executive Philippe Dauman, who is suing over his removal from Sumner Redstone's trust, on Monday said in a court filing that a judge should expedite the matter because the 93-year-old media mogul is in ill health and may soon not be able to provide needed evidence.Saying ""time is of the essence,"" the filing in Massachusetts state court describes Redstone as unable to ""speak, stand, walk, eat, write or read.""A spokesman for Redstone did not have an immediate comment.Last month, Redstone removed Dauman and Viacom board member George Abrams from the trust that would determine the future of CBS Corp (CBS.N) and Viacom after controlling shareholder Redstone, 93, dies or is declared mentally incapacitated.The pair were also removed from the board of Redstone's National Amusements Inc, a private movie theater company that holds 80 percent of Viacom's and CBS's voting stock.   The outcome of the Massachusetts case and a similar one in California, and who ends up controlling the trust and the National Amusements board, will have wide-ranging implications for Viacom and CBS and could result in changes at the top of both companies, possibly through mergers and acquisitions. A judge is expected to hear arguments on Dauman's request to expedite discovery and a trial on Tuesday.

Redstone has ousted Dauman and George Abrams from the board of National Amusements and from the trust that will control Redstone's voting shares after he dies or is declared mentally incompetent.Dauman and Abrams have filed a lawsuit in Massachusetts, arguing that their removal from the trust amounted to an ""unlawful corporate takeover"" engineered by Redstone's daughter, Shari. That same lawsuit challenges Redstone's competency. In Friday's filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Viacom argues that if the removal of Dauman and Abrams are found to be ""the product of Mr. Redstone's incapacity and/or undue influence,"" then the bylaw change may be void.A Massachusetts judge is currently considering Dauman's motion to speed up discovery and expedite the trial related to his lawsuit. Lawyers for Shari Redstone oppose that motion, arguing in court filings that Dauman and Abrams were motivated by self interest. They said they plan to file a motion to dismiss the case on June 16.Shares of Viacom fell nearly 2.6 percent, or $1.17 to $43.24, in mid-day trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

396,"  NEW YORK Viacom Inc (VIAB.O) is still looking to sell a minority stake in its Paramount film unit, but objections from controlling shareholder Sumner Redstone have impeded the deal, CEO Philippe Dauman told investors on Thursday.Redstone's National Amusements Inc, which holds 80 percent of Viacom voting shares, recently amended the bylaws of Viacom to require unanimous approval from Viacom's board for any deal related to Paramount Pictures.Viacom has narrowed down the bidders for the 49-percent stake of Paramount to a small group of ""global strategic partners,"" and had hoped to announce a deal by the end of June, but ""recent events have slowed the process,"" Dauman told Gabelli & Company’s 8th Annual Movie & Entertainment Conference.National Amusements said in a statement on Monday that it ""is not opposed to a transaction that would unlock value at Paramount,"" but added that any proposed deal ""should be thoroughly vetted and approved by Viacom's full board.""Viacom said at the time that the bylaw change was ""completely at odds with good corporate governance."" While in the past Dauman had said that proceeds from a sale of the Paramount stake would be used to pay off debt, on Thursday he emphasized that it would also be used for strategic development, particularly internationally.""We will unlock value of $10 or more per Viacom share if we can bring this transaction that we are working on to a successful conclusion,"" Dauman said, adding that the $10 would be after taxes. ""I think, I expect and I hope that we would be able to move forward with it,"" he said.Dauman is suing over his removal last month from the Sumner Redstone trust that will eventually control Viacom and CBS Corp (CBS.N) as well as the National Amusements board. In his presentation, Dauman also said Viacom was seeing  high single digit price increases in ads, and mid- to high single digit increases in the volume of ad sales in this year's television upfronts. Shares of Viacom fell 16 cents, or 0.36 percent, to close at $44.41.

""In reality, putting up a wall around you ensures more litigation - and that is not what we want.""A representative for Redstone declined to comment.Last month Redstone ejected Viacom Chief Executive Philippe Dauman and another director from the board of National Amusements Inc, which controls 80 percent of the voting shares of Viacom.

""I don't think it's appropriate to use shareholder money toward his compensation given the company's performance.""Viacom, which owns Comedy Central, Nickelodeon, MTV and Paramount, has been struggling to turn around its ratings. Reflecting some of that weakness, the company's stock is down nearly 50 percent over the past two years.On Friday, Viacom said its third-quarter profit would fall well short of Wall Street expectations, citing a disappointing domestic box office haul from its latest Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie and disruption stemming from all the controversy.Viacom's stock has risen about 15 percent since May 20, when Redstone removed Dauman and board member George Abrams from the seven-person trust that will ultimately control Redstone's media empire.

407,"   By Jessica Toonkel and Dan Levine  Viacom Inc controlling stockholder Sumner Redstone called it ""offensive and untrue"" to suggest that he was unduly influenced by his daughter to remove Viacom Chief Executive Officer Philippe Dauman from a trust overseeing his shares, according to a court filing.Redstone submitted to a Massachusetts court an affidavit made under oath on Monday in an effort to move litigation over his decisions to a California court from Massachusetts.The 93-year-old media mogul, who has trouble speaking and needs around-the-clock care, last month removed Dauman and board member George Abrams from the seven-person trust that will control Redstone's majority ownership of media companies Viacom and CBS Corp  when he dies or is deemed incapacitated. Dauman and Abrams shot back with their own Massachusetts lawsuit contesting their removal from the trust and from the board of National Amusements Inc, Redstone's privately held movie theater company through which he owns 80 percent of the voting shares of CBS and Viacom. In their suit, they claimed that Redstone is not mentally competent and has been manipulated by his daughter.""I understand that Philippe Dauman and George Abrams contend that I was unduly influenced by my daughter to remove them as trustees and directors. That is offensive and untrue. I want that dispute, and any challenge to my competency, to be decided in Los Angeles California,"" Redstone said in his affidavit. In a statement, Dauman said the court filing from Redstone's attorneys ""represent continued efforts to avoid a fair inquiry into Sumner's well-being.""

Redstone and National Amusements sought the approval of the Court of Chancery in Delaware - the state where Viacom is incorporated - to kick off the board members.

420,"   By Jonathan Stempel  Google and Viacom on Monday defeated an appeal in a nationwide class action lawsuit by parents who claimed the companies illegally tracked the online activity of children under the age of 13 who watched videos and played video games on Nickelodeon's website.By a 3-0 vote, the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia said Google, a unit of Alphabet Inc, and Viacom Inc were not liable under several federal and state laws for planting ""cookies"" on boys' and girls' computers, to gather data that advertisers could use to send targeted ads.The court also revived one state law privacy claim against Viacom, claiming that it promised on the Nick.com website not to collect children's personal information, but did so anyway.Monday's decision largely upheld a January 2015 ruling by U.S. District Judge Stanley Chesler in Newark, New Jersey. It returned the surviving claim to him.Jay Barnes, a lawyer for the parents, declined to comment. Viacom spokesman Jeremy Zweig said the company is pleased with the dismissals and confident it will prevail on the remaining claim. ""Nickelodeon is proud of its record on children's privacy issues and strongly committed to the best practices in the industry,"" he added.Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Monday's decision is a fresh setback for computer users, after the same appeals court last November 10 said Google was not liable under federal privacy laws for bypassing cookie blockers on Apple Inc's Safari browser and Microsoft Corp's Internet Explorer browser. Circuit Judge Julio Fuentes, who wrote both decisions, said that ruling doomed many of the parents' claims against Mountain View, California-based Google and New York-based Viacom.He also rejected the parents' claims under the Video Privacy Protection Act, a 1988 law adopted a year after a newspaper wrote about movies rented by failed Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork, based on a list provided by a video store.Fuentes said the law was meant to thwart the collection of data to help monitor people's video-watching behavior. He said Congress, despite amending the law in 2013, never updated it to cover the collection of data such as users' IP addresses, browser settings and operating settings, and reflect a ""contemporary understanding"" of Internet privacy.""Some disclosures predicated on new technology, such as the dissemination of precise GPS coordinates or customer ID numbers, may suffice,"" Fuentes wrote. ""But others--including the kinds of disclosures described by the plaintiffs here--are simply too far afield from the circumstances that motivated the act's passage to trigger liability.""The revived privacy claim accused Viacom of reneging on a promise on Nick.com that said: ""HEY GROWN-UPS: We don't collect ANY personal information about your kids.

It returned the surviving claim to him.Jay Barnes, a lawyer for the parents, declined to comment.Viacom spokesman Jeremy Zweig said the company is pleased with the dismissals and confident it will prevail on the remaining claim. ""Nickelodeon is proud of its record on children's privacy issues and strongly committed to the best practices in the industry,"" he added. Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Monday's decision is a fresh setback for computer users, after the same appeals court last November 10 said Google was not liable under federal privacy laws for bypassing cookie blockers on Apple Inc's Safari browser and Microsoft Corp's Internet Explorer browser.Circuit Judge Julio Fuentes, who wrote both decisions, said that ruling doomed many of the parents' claims against Mountain View, California-based Google and New York-based Viacom. He also rejected the parents' claims under the Video Privacy Protection Act, a 1988 law adopted a year after a newspaper wrote about movies rented by failed Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork, based on a list provided by a video store.Fuentes said the law was meant to thwart the collection of data to help monitor people's video-watching behavior.He said Congress, despite amending the law in 2013, never updated it to cover the collection of data such as users' IP addresses, browser settings and operating settings, and reflect a ""contemporary understanding"" of Internet privacy. ""Some disclosures predicated on new technology, such as the dissemination of precise GPS coordinates or customer ID numbers, may suffice,"" Fuentes wrote. ""But others--including the kinds of disclosures described by the plaintiffs here--are simply too far afield from the circumstances that motivated the act's passage to trigger liability.""The revived privacy claim accused Viacom of reneging on a promise on Nick.com that said: ""HEY GROWN-UPS: We don't collect ANY personal information about your kids. Which means we couldn't share it even if we wanted to!""Fuentes said a reasonable jury might find Viacom liable for ""intrusion upon seclusion"" if it found its alleged privacy intrusion ""highly offensive to the ordinary reasonable man.""The case is In re: Nickelodeon Consumer Privacy Litigation, 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 15-1441.

423,"   By Jessica Toonkel | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Investor groups are using the high-profile battle for control of Viacom Inc (VIAB.O) to rally support for their campaigns against dual-class share structures which give founders and insiders outsized voting rights.Mercy Investment Services is partnering with Missionary Oblates, a Roman Catholic congregation in Washington, to submit a proposal in September to collapse the dual class shares at Viacom. The socially responsible investor is going to start reaching out to shareholders next month in hopes that the public feuding at the company will help win support for the proposal, said Donna Meyer, director of shareholder advocacy at Mercy. Mercy presented a similar proposal by Missionary Oblates last February but it was rejected.""This is really big news, so no one should say to me 'I don't know Viacom,'"" Meyer said.Similarly, the Council for Institutional Investors, an influential group of top U.S. pension plans, is using Viacom as a ""top talking point,"" to urge members to take a stronger stance against companies adopting the dual class structure, said Ken Bertsch, executive director of the trade association.    Investor concern about dual class companies, in which only one class of investors has voting rights, has been increasing as a growing number of companies are adopting this structure when they go public, Bertsch said. In March, the Council for Institutional Investors adopted a policy that all investors in IPOs should have equal voting rights.There have been eight proposals to collapse the dual share class at S&P 500 companies so far this year, up from zero in 2012, according to proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services.    Ending the special voting rights is usually impossible without support from the insiders who benefit from the dual class structures. Defenders of the structure argue that it allows management, often founders, to focus on long-term performance. The Viacom situation, where the company's Chief Executive Philippe Dauman is questioning the mental competence of 93-year-old Sumner Redstone, shows the need for a sunset provision on this kind of structure, said Jon Lukomnik, executive director of New York-based Investor Responsibility Research Center Institute.""Even if you were to accept the rationale that you have a visionary leader, there is a point at which that changes,"" said Lukomnik.

426,"   By Jessica Toonkel  Mario Gabelli, Viacom Inc's (VIAB.O) second-largest holder of voting shares behind majority owner Sumner Redstone, believes that Chief Executive Philippe Dauman can do nothing to save his job because he cannot win his battle with the Redstone family over control of the media company.His comments come as the legal battle over the 93-year-old Redstone's $40 billion media empire heats up. Some investors unhappy with the pace of improvement at Viacom hope that change at the top is imminent.Gabelli had shown more patience, saying as recently as May that Dauman had six months to turn the company around. But the billionaire investor's latest comments, to Reuters on Wednesday,  mark the first time he has said the CEO is out of options. ""He has to leave,"" Gabelli said of Dauman in an interview. ""It's a matter of when, not if.""Since the Redstones own 80 percent of the voting shares of Viacom and CBS through their privately owned National Amusements Inc, Gabelli said, Dauman is fighting a battle he is unlikely to win.Dauman contends in a Massachusetts lawsuit that Redstone is being manipulated by his daughter, Shari Redstone, and through a Viacom spokesman said: ""The truth about Mr. Redstone’s wishes remain very much in dispute.”In the litigation, Dauman is contesting the removal of him and Viacom director George Abrams from the Sumner M Redstone National Amusements Inc Trust, which eventually will control the fate of Viacom and CBS Corp (CBS.N). The lawsuit says Redstone is incompetent and being manipulated by Shari Redstone. A spokesman for Redstone declined to comment. Viacom, which owns television networks Nickelodeon and  Comedy Central - as well as film studio Paramount Pictures - has been struggling to improve its ratings as younger viewers watch more content online.A spokesman for National Amusements said in a statement Thursday that with a more independent board and a new CEO, it believes Viacom would become ""an entertainment powerhouse."" ""Viacom owns some of the best assets in the entertainment industry,"" the spokesman said. Viacom's shares ended regular trading on Thursday up 4 percent. The stock is up 10 percent since Redstone removed Dauman from the trust in late May.The judge in the Massachusetts case is expected to rule in the next few days on whether he will allow that case to proceed in his court or in California.Redstone has also moved to oust Dauman and four other directors from the Viacom board. Viacom's lead independent director, Fred Salerno, has filed a lawsuit contesting that move in a Delaware court. Oral arguments on that case are scheduled to begin July 29. Gabelli said he did not understand why the board and CEO would fight what he sees as their inevitable departures.""Let's say I don't understand the dynamics that are occurring,"" he said. ""She (Shari Redstone) has 80 percent of the vote and we have 10 percent."" He declined to comment on what he would like to see happen to Viacom.Even if Paramount's ""Star Trek,"" movie does well in theaters when it comes out later this month, it will not matter for Dauman, Gabelli said.""It's irrelevant,"" Gabelli said. ""Either way he leaves.""

429,"  (Adds attorney comment on appeal, Viacom share price)By Lisa RichwineLOS ANGELES, July 11 An ex-girlfriend of media mogul Sumner Redstone will not be granted a new trial over her lawsuit that challenged the 93-year-old's mental competence, a California judge said in a tentative ruling on Monday.Former companion Manuela Herzer argued that recent developments surrounding Viacom Inc, one of the media companies that Redstone controls, provided new evidence to support her claim that the billionaire mogul was being manipulated.""There are no grounds for a new trial under the facts presented,"" Judge David Cowan wrote in a tentative ruling.California judges often issue tentative rulings, which are then finalized after a hearing with few major changes. Viacom shares dropped 1.8 percent in afternoon trading to $44.37 on Nasdaq.In a lawsuit filed last year, Herzer had challenged her removal as Redstone's designated healthcare agent in October 2015. In May, Cowan dismissed Herzer's case after one day of testimony. Less than two weeks later, Redstone removed Viacom Chief Executive Philippe Dauman and another board member from the trust that will control Viacom and CBS Corp after Redstone dies or is declared incapacitated, according to Redstone's spokesman.Judge Cowan noted that Redstone, in a videotaped deposition presented at Herzer's original trial in May, ""has vehemently indicated he does not want her in his life.""""The proceeding is not reasonably necessary to protect Redstone's interests as a patient,"" Cowan wrote. Herzer's attorneys will appeal the dismissal of her lawsuit, lawyer Pierce O'Donnell told reporters on Monday. O'Donnell said he would file the appeal within a day or two and ask to have it expedited.Herzer and Dauman have argued in court documents that Redstone suffers from diminished mental competency and is a victim of undue influence exerted by his daughter, Shari. She denies that allegation, saying her father makes his own decisions. Redstone's attorneys also say the mogul is fully aware of his actions.Dauman is challenging his removal from the trust in separate litigation in Delaware. Fred Salerno, Viacom's lead independent director, also has filed suit in Delaware to challenge the removal of Viacom board members in June.(Reporting by Lisa Richwine in Los Angeles; Editing by Bernadette Baum and Nick Zieminski)",2016-07-11,CBS,"Mon Jul 11, 2016 | 1:29pm EDT",UPDATE 2-Judge rejects new trial for Sumner Redstone's ex-girlfriend,http://www.reuters.com//article/viacom-redstone-herzer-idUSL1N19X0V2?type=companyNews
430,"   By Liana B. Baker and Jessica Toonkel  Chinese real estate and entertainment conglomerate Dalian Wanda Group has held talks with Viacom Inc about acquiring a minority stake in its Paramount Pictures unit, according to two people familiar with the situation.Wanda's interest adds new urgency to deliberations over  Paramount's future, which has become the flashpoint of a bitter row between Viacom Chief Executive Philippe Dauman and the company's controlling shareholder Sumner Redstone. Wanda, which bought production company Legendary Entertainment in January, has been trying to expand its U.S. movie business. Redstone has so far opposed the sale, which is not possible without his consent. Other parties besides Wanda have also expressed an interest in Paramount, and there is no certainty any deal will be reached, the people said this week. The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is not public. Viacom declined to comment, while Wanda did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Earlier this year, Wanda invested in Paramount's ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" sequel.    If the two parties did agree to a deal, it would likely become the next flashpoint in the long-running battle for control of Sumner Redstone's $40 billion media empire.    The Paramount deal has been championed by Viacom Chief Executive Philippe Dauman, who is seeking to sell a 49 percent stake in the movie studio but opposed by 93-year-old Redstone, who owns 80 percent of Viacom and CBS Corp.    It is not clear that Redstone and his daughter Shari Redstone would agree to a deal if one was struck.     Shari Redstone spokeswoman Nancy Sterling and Sumner Redstone spokesman Mike Lawrence declined to comment.     Redstone, supported by his daughter, is waging a two-pronged legal battle with Dauman and other Viacom directors, which originated with a disagreement over the proposed sale of a stake in Paramount.    In May, Redstone removed Dauman and another Viacom board member, George Abrams, from the seven-person Sumner M Redstone National Amusements Inc Trust, which will determine the fate of Redstone's holdings, and hence the future of Viacom and CBS, after Redstone dies or is incapacitated.Paramount has special resonance for Redstone, who fought long and hard to acquire the movie studio from Barry Diller in 1994.     Redstone's move to throw Dauman and Abrams off his trust is the subject of a court case in Massachusetts. In June, Redstone moved to take Dauman and four other directors off the board of Viacom, through his privately held movie theater company National Amusements Inc, which holds 80 percent of voting shares of Viacom as well as CBS.   A court in Delaware is considering whether that move was legal.    Dauman is contesting both actions, arguing that Redstone is not mentally competent to make decisions.     Throughout the legal face-off, Dauman has said Viacom has been working on the Paramount stake sale, even after National Amusements changed its bylaws to require unanimous approval from Viacom's board for any deal related to Paramount. At the time, National Amusements said it was ""not opposed to a transaction that would unlock value at Paramount.""     Dauman has said the divestiture would unlock value of $10 or more per Viacom share and that he would use the proceeds from a sale to pay off debt and for strategic development, particularly overseas.

435,"   By Jessica Toonkel  Viacom Inc Chief Executive Philippe Dauman and Chief Operating Officer Thomas Dooley have reserved their legal right to resign ""with good reason"" in a move to protect tens of millions of dollars in potential severance pay.The move is the latest in the battle for control of Viacom, part of Sumner Redstone's $40 billion media empire, which has caused a rift between Redstone, backed by his daughter, and his long-time lieutenant Dauman.According to regulatory filings made public on Monday, Dauman and Dooley sent letters reserving the right to resign if a judge issues a final order approving Redstone's action last month to remove Dauman and four other directors from Viacom's board. Monday's move is important as executives are generally entitled to receive severance pay if they resign with good reason, but not if they are removed. Dauman and Dooley's employment agreements state they can resign with good reason if there are changes to Viacom's board.Dooley and Dauman were required by the terms of their employment agreements to file their letters within 30 days of a ""good reason event"" to be eligible for their severance packages, in this case Redstone's June 16 actions to remove and replace board directors. Under their employment agreements, Dooley could receive more than $30 million in severance compensation and Dauman could receive more than $90 million, according to the company's most recent proxy filing.Viacom and National Amusements declined comment. Last month, 93-year-old Redstone moved to oust five directors from the Viacom board, including Dauman, even though he remains CEO.Redstone made the move through his privately held movie theater company National Amusements Inc, which holds 80 percent of Viacom's voting shares. National Amusements gave no reason for the removals, but it was seen as a big step toward a management shake-up at the media company, which has been struggling with sagging ratings.

436,"  Viacom Inc (VIAB.O) Chief Executive Philippe Dauman and Chief Operating Officer Thomas Dooley have reserved their legal right to resign ""with good reason"" in a move to protect tens of millions of dollars in potential severance pay. The move is the latest in the battle for control of Viacom, part of Sumner Redstone's $40 billion media empire, which has caused a rift between Redstone, backed by his daughter, and his long-time lieutenant Dauman.According to regulatory filings made public on Monday, Dauman and Dooley sent letters reserving the right to resign if a judge issues a final order approving Redstone's action last month to remove Dauman and four other directors from Viacom's board.Monday's move is important as executives are generally entitled to receive severance pay if they resign with good reason, but not if they are removed. Dauman and Dooley's employment agreements state they can resign with good reason if there are changes to Viacom's board.Dooley and Dauman were required by the terms of their employment agreements to file their letters within 30 days of a ""good reason event"" to be eligible for their severance packages, in this case Redstone's June 16 actions to remove and replace board directors. Under their employment agreements, Dooley could receive more than $30 million in severance compensation and Dauman could receive more than $90 million, according to the company's most recent proxy filing.Viacom and National Amusements declined comment.  Last month, 93-year-old Redstone moved to oust five directors from the Viacom board, including Dauman, even though he remains CEO. Redstone made the move through his privately held movie theater company National Amusements Inc, which holds 80 percent of Viacom's voting shares. National Amusements gave no reason for the removals, but it was seen as a big step toward a management shake-up at the media company, which has been struggling with sagging ratings.

449,"   By Sai Sachin Ravikumar  Viacom Inc (VIAB.O) Chief Executive Philippe Dauman said on Thursday his victories in a legal battle with Sumner Redstone for control of the media company would help him push through a plan to sell a minority stake in Paramount Pictures.Ninety-three-year-old Redstone, supported by daughter Shari, opposes Dauman's plan to sell a 49 percent stake in Paramount, while Dauman sees it as a way to unlock value for shareholders, who have seen their shares plummet in value in recent years.Analysts have valued the stake at about $4 billion.Sumner Redstone is Viacom's biggest shareholder. However, his decision to oust Dauman from both Viacom's board and a trust that will control Redstone's shareholding after he dies or becomes incapacitated is being challenged in the courts on the grounds that he is not of sound mind to make such decisions.Redstone controls 80 percent of the voting shares in Viacom.""The (Paramount stake sale) process has slowed down in recent weeks but we have reason to believe the favorable court developments last week will create a better environment that will allow us to progress with several parties toward a highly beneficial transaction,"" Dauman said on a call with analysts to discuss Viacom's quarterly earnings.Dauman has scored two important legal wins in the past week.A Delaware judge ruled that Redstone's lawyers must defend in a trial his move to oust five Viacom directors including Dauman, and a Massachusetts judge rejected Redstone's bid to dismiss a lawsuit by the Viacom CEO.The lawsuit in Massachusetts, filed by Dauman and Viacom board member George Abrams, contested their removal in May from the seven-person trust that will control Redstone's majority ownership of Viacom and CBS Corp (CBS.N). DOMESTIC AD REVENUE SINKS National Amusements Inc, through which Redstone controls Viacom and CBS Corp (CBS.N), said Viacom's quarterly results underscored the need for new leadership at the media company.""It is time for Viacom’s current directors to stop supporting failed management and start representing shareholders, by allowing the new board to take the reins, and return the company to its position as an industry leader,” National Amusements said in a statement.Viacom shot back with its own response, saying the company was focused on executing a strategic plan supported by a majority of its independent board. Viacom reported a surprise rise in quarterly revenue, following six straight quarters of decline, as the owner of MTV, Comedy Central and Nickelodeon benefited from higher license fees and theatrical revenue at its movie unit.But domestic advertising revenue continued to sink, falling for the eighth consecutive quarter.The 4 percent slide in domestic ad revenue was steeper than the 3.8 percent drop expected by analysts on average, according to research firm FactSet StreetAccount.The company also said that domestic ad revenue in the current quarter would be slightly weaker than in the quarter ended June 30. Viacom issued a quarterly profit forecast in June that was well short of Wall Street expectations. The company cited disruptions stemming from the dispute roiling its board and management, as well as disappointing box-office performance of its latest ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" movie.Despite the film's weak performance, revenue in New York-based Viacom's movie business jumped 30 percent to $621 million in the three months ended June 30.Up to Wednesday's close, Viacom's shares had lost about 47 percent of their value in the past two years, partly reflecting the company's struggle to turn around ratings, especially as younger viewers - a key demographic for networks like MTV - turn away from traditional television to view content online.The stock, which closed at $43.99 on Wednesday, was up marginally in morning trade on Thursday.The net profit attributable to Viacom fell to $432 million, or $1.09 per share, from $591 million, or $1.47 per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, Viacom earned $1.05 per share, beating the average analyst estimate of $1.01, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Total revenue rose 1.6 percent to $3.11 billion. Analysts on average had expected $3.01 billion.

DOMESTIC AD REVENUE SINKS National Amusements Inc, through which Redstone controls Viacom and CBS Corp (CBS.N), said Viacom's quarterly results underscored the need for new leadership at the media company.""It is time for Viacom’s current directors to stop supporting failed management and start representing shareholders, by allowing the new board to take the reins, and return the company to its position as an industry leader,” National Amusements said in a statement.Viacom shot back with its own response, saying the company was focused on executing a strategic plan supported by a majority of its independent board. Viacom reported a surprise rise in quarterly revenue, following six straight quarters of decline, as the owner of MTV, Comedy Central and Nickelodeon benefited from higher license fees and theatrical revenue at its movie unit.But domestic advertising revenue continued to sink, falling for the eighth consecutive quarter.The 4 percent slide in domestic ad revenue was steeper than the 3.8 percent drop expected by analysts on average, according to research firm FactSet StreetAccount.The company also said that domestic ad revenue in the current quarter would be slightly weaker than in the quarter ended June 30. Viacom issued a quarterly profit forecast in June that was well short of Wall Street expectations. The company cited disruptions stemming from the dispute roiling its board and management, as well as disappointing box-office performance of its latest ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" movie.Despite the film's weak performance, revenue in New York-based Viacom's movie business jumped 30 percent to $621 million in the three months ended June 30.Up to Wednesday's close, Viacom's shares had lost about 47 percent of their value in the past two years, partly reflecting the company's struggle to turn around ratings, especially as younger viewers - a key demographic for networks like MTV - turn away from traditional television to view content online.The stock, which closed at $43.99 on Wednesday, was up marginally in morning trade on Thursday.The net profit attributable to Viacom fell to $432 million, or $1.09 per share, from $591 million, or $1.47 per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, Viacom earned $1.05 per share, beating the average analyst estimate of $1.01, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Total revenue rose 1.6 percent to $3.11 billion. Analysts on average had expected $3.01 billion.

454,"   By Ross Kerber | CANTON, Mass.  CANTON, Mass. An attorney for Sumner Redstone said the media mogul would be willing to be interviewed briefly under oath in a lawsuit over his mental competency that could influence the future of his majority ownership of Viacom and CBS.The issue arose as part of a lawsuit that is questioning whether the 93-year-old Redstone knew what he was doing when he removed Viacom Inc (VIAB.O) Chief Executive Officer Philippe Dauman and fellow Viacom board member George Abrams in May from a seven-person trust.The trust will control Redstone's majority ownership of Viacom and CBS Corp (CBS.N) when he dies or is incapacitated.At a hearing on Friday in Norfolk County Probate and Family Court in Canton, Massachusetts, Judge George Phelan set a Sept. 19 trial date. Redstone attorney Robert Klieger said his client would agree to a ""brief"" deposition in the run up to trial, though attorneys for Dauman are also seeking a medical exam of Redstone. ""We don't believe a further medical exam is necessary,"" Klieger said. Phelan set a hearing for Aug. 26 to discuss both the deposition and the medical exam.Dauman and Abrams filed a lawsuit in Massachusetts, where the trust was established, contesting their removal from the trust and the board of National Amusements Inc, Redstone's privately held movie theater company. Through National Amusements, Redstone owns 80 percent of the voting shares of CBS and Viacom. The outcome of the case, and who ends up with control over the trust, will have wide-ranging implications for Viacom and CBS shareholders and could result in changes at the top of both companies, possibly through mergers and acquisitions.Abrams and Dauman claim Redstone suffers from dementia, impaired cognition, a slowness of mental processing, a loss of memory, apathy, depression, and has been manipulated by his daughter, Shari Redstone. In a June court filing, Sumner Redstone called it ""offensive and untrue"" to suggest that he was being unduly influenced.Redstone and National Amusements also moved to oust five  Viacom directors in June, including Dauman and lead independent director Frederic Salerno, asking a court in Delaware to rule that the changes were valid. Salerno fired back with his own lawsuit challenging the removal. Viacom is incorporated in Delaware.

The Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the situation, reported that one sticking point was when directors would leave Viacom's board.

In June, Redstone took steps to remove Dauman, Frederic Salerno and three other directors from Viacom's board.

Muoio & Co has owned voting shares of Viacom for six years. ""I can't remember the last time they had an analyst day."" In fact, the last analyst day was in 2006.Dooley is hardly guaranteed to get the top job, making his outreach campaign important for himself as well as for the company. Some investors believe it would be better for the role to go to an outsider with a more creative background who could attract new talent and improve programming across Viacom, which has been struggling with lagging ratings. Others want Viacom to merge with CBS, also controlled by the Redstone family.Dooley and Dauman have worked together for more than 30 years. They have been at Viacom twice, most recently returning in 2006 after Viacom was spun off from CBS when Dauman became CEO and Dooley was chief administrative officer, eventually being promoted to chief operating officer. ""I would prefer somebody with a fresh perspective who has a stronger background in entertainment and media,"" said Ben Strubel, a principal with Lancaster, Pennsylvania-based wealth manager Strubel Investment Management, which owns non-voting shares of Viacom.Viacom has taken steps to improve its programming and Dooley hopes to better convey those steps as well as what the company is doing to provide advertisers with better data on its viewers, the sources said. Dooley, who was an architect of Viacom's strategy around data, plans to work with the company's board to assess Viacom's turnaround strategy, one of the sources said.Viacom has been struggling to turn around its declining ratings as more of its viewers cancel cable to get content online. Domestic ad revenue sank 4 percent in the third quarter and Viacom's stock is down 50 percent over the past two years.For investor Mario Gabelli, whose firm is the second-largest owner of voting shares after Redstone, the real question is whether Viacom will be put back together with CBS and run by CBS CEO Leslie Moonves.""I believe that Les can run this,"" he said.

461,"   By Jessica Toonkel | NEW YORK  NEW YORK - Viacom Inc (VIAB.O) and controlling shareholder Sumner Redstone have come to an agreement on terms of a settlement that would result in the departure of Chief Executive Philippe Dauman, two sources familiar with the situation told Reuters on Thursday.An announcement is expected to come Thursday night, sources said.The settlement would end the battle for control over Redstone's $40 billion empire that includes Viacom and CBS, and which has been a source of shareholder angst and months of uncertainty.It would also conclude the legal battle between Dauman and Redstone in Massachusetts over the CEO's removal from National Amusements Inc, the privately held company that holds Redstone's Viacom and CBS Corp (CBS.N) voting shares, as well as the trust that will determine the fate of both media companies when the 93-year-old dies or is deemed mentally incapacitated.Under terms of the settlement, if finalized, Dauman, 62, will be replaced by Viacom Chief Operating Officer and his longtime right-hand man, Thomas Dooley, who will be interim CEO until Sept. 30, and then may stay on longer, according to the sources, who wished to remain anonymous because the discussions are confidential. As part of the agreement, Dauman will stay on as executive chairman until Sept. 13 and be allowed to present his plan to sell a minority stake in Paramount Pictures to the Viacom board, the sources said. Dauman will receive about $72 million under the agreement, they said.Spokesmen for Viacom and National Amusements declined to comment.     Sumner Redstone in May removed Dauman and Viacom board member George Abrams from the Sumner M. Redstone National Amusements Inc Trust. A spokesman for Redstone said the media mogul had been unhappy with the company's performance and about Dauman's plans to sell a stake in Paramount Pictures.Dauman and Abrams shot back with their own lawsuit to prevent their removal from the trust, arguing that Redstone was being manipulated by his daughter, Shari. Shari Redstone called the allegation ""absurd"" and said her father made his own decisions.Redstone also moved to kick Dauman and four other directors off the board in June, sparking litigation in Delaware to block the attempt.Under the settlement, the board would add the five directors that National Amusements put forward in June. It is unclear when the directors that National Amusements moved to replace will leave the board. Sumner Redstone's granddaughter, Keryn Redstone, has filed a cross-complaint in connection to that lawsuit, and is planning to proceed with her lawsuit even if there is a settlement, according to a source familiar with the situation. However, that suit is unlikely to affect the removal of Dauman from Viacom and Redstone's trust.Since he became CEO in 2006, Dauman has received over $409 million in reported compensation, according to Equilar.Dauman, who has worked with Sumner Redstone for more than 30 years, gained the title of executive chairman in February, when the media mogul relinquished that role. Shari Redstone had opposed Dauman's elevation to executive chairman. Shares of Viacom have fallen around 50 percent in the past two years as its cable networks, including MTV and Nickelodeon, suffered from falling ratings because younger viewers were migrating online and to mobile video. Viacom's U.S. advertising revenue has declined for eight straight quarters.Dauman has tried to turn Viacom around by wooing advertisers with data to better target commercials. Under his leadership, Viacom renewed a multi-year distribution contract with satellite TV provider Dish Network Corp (DISH.O).But it was Dauman's plans to sell Viacom's stake in Paramount Pictures, which investors cheered, that caused him troubles.

468,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, August 22 (Fitch) According to Fitch Ratings, Viacom, Inc.'s (Viacom)  announced leadership transition, creation of an expanded board of directors and  the settlement of the litigation related to corporate governance issues is a  credit positive but will not have an impact on Viacom's 'BBB' Issuer Default  Rating.  The Rating Outlook remains Negative.   Viacom's approximately $12.8 billion of debt (face value - including commercial  paper) outstanding as of June 30, 2016 is affected by Fitch's action. A full  list of ratings follows at the end of this release. Resolution of the litigation involving Viacom's controlling shareholder,  National Amusements, Inc. and NAI Entertainment Holdings LLC (together, NAI) and  Viacom's board of directors and senior executives, resulting in an orderly  transition of Viacom's leadership and board, is a positive development for  Viacom's credit profile.  The agreement eliminates the overhang created by the  ongoing discord among the parties and positions and allows the company to put in  place strategic and operating plans to address the persistent weakening of  Viacom's operating profile.   Fitch cautions, however, that the leadership changeover is a two-step process.   Viacom's new board, working with the company's interim president and CEO, Thomas  Dooley, will finalize the succession plan for Viacom's president and CEO.  Fitch  recognizes that Viacom's financial and strategic plans will remain in flux until  the board agrees on a new president and CEO and final plans are in place. We  expect a permanent president and CEO will be in place by Sept. 30, 2016.   The Negative Outlook incorporates the uncertainty related to Viacom's ability to  stabilize and strengthen its operating profile amid the persistent secular  challenges to its business model.  Viacom's new board of directors and  management will face the challenge of strengthening the company's operating  profile and competitive position. The strategies currently in place have  struggled to produce tangible evidence that they are regaining positive  operating momentum and reducing volatility in the company's key cable network  businesses. The expected rebound of Viacom's operating profile has taken longer  than Fitch previously anticipated.  Fitch believes reversing these negative operating trends will be difficult in  the current operating environment. Competition for viewing audience within  Viacom's targeted demographic will remain fierce, as this younger demographic is  migrating away from traditional linear video programming. Moreover, given  Viacom's reliance on the kids and teen demographic segments, the company depends  more on advertising categories which target kids and teens, relative to its peer  group. To combat these issues, Viacom has increased its investment in  programming, focusing on producing more original programming across its cable  network portfolio, adding more scripted shows and event programming, and  becoming more selective in acquiring programming. In addition to the programming  investment, Viacom has created products to improve the monetization of both  linear and non-linear viewership and improve the yield on its advertising  inventory, including its Viacom Vantage, Velocity and Echo offerings.  The growth rates of Viacom's affiliate fee revenues also lag behind its peer  group of large diversified media companies and present a new challenge to the  company's operating model.  Growth has slowed due to recent subscriber rate  adjustments and the re-tiering of certain networks.  Affiliate fee revenue  growth will be further hampered during the remainder of fiscal 2016 and possibly  into fiscal 2017 due to the difficulty in signing previously expected SVOD  agreements, attributable to the ongoing corporate governance issues. Fitch's  base case assumes that domestic affiliate fee revenues will decline at a  mid-single-digit rate during fiscal 2016 before rebounding to a low-single-digit  growth rate during fiscal 2017. Viacom's historically aggressive capital allocation posture, which has long  favored share repurchases in excess of free cash flow (FCF) generation, along  with the weak operating results have combined to reduce Viacom's financial  flexibility and weaken its credit profile. Viacom's leverage increased to 3.6x  during the latest 12 month (LTM) period ended June 30, 2016, which is outside  the company's 2.75x to 3.0x leverage target. Fitch anticipates that leverage  will improve during fiscal 2017 but will remain above 3x through Viacom's fiscal  2017 year-end before trending below 3x during fiscal 2018. Importantly, Fitch  does not anticipate any meaningful debt reduction during the remainder of  calendar 2016 and expects scheduled maturities during 2017 to be refinanced.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: Upward ratings momentum is unlikely during the current ratings  horizon. Stabilization of the Outlook at the current rating is predicated on the  company successfully executing on its strategies to address persistent secular  threats to its business, and recapturing positive operating momentum, as  evidenced by sustainable positive domestic advertising and affiliate fee revenue  growth and expanding operating margins. In addition, Fitch needs to observe  clear articulation of a strategy to strengthen Viacom's operating profile.  Negative: Negative rating actions are more likely to coincide with the company's  inability to strengthen its operating profile and reduce leverage below 3.5x.  Resumption of share repurchase activity or other aggressive financial policy  decisions that delay the anticipated improvement of Viacom's credit profile  would also result in negative rating action.    FULL LIST OF RATINGS  Fitch currently rates Viacom as follows:  --Long-term Issuer Default Rating 'BBB'; --Senior unsecured notes and debentures 'BBB'; --Senior unsecured bank facility due 2019 'BBB'; --Short-term IDR 'F2'; --Commercial paper 'F2'.

470,"   By Jessica Toonkel  Viacom Inc affirmed its support for Brad Grey as head of its Paramount Pictures movie studio in a statement Friday.The company said that its vice chair, Shari Redstone, the Viacom board and its new interim CEO Thomas Dooley believe the studio's leadership ""can return Paramount to success.""The statement comes amid speculation within the industry that Viacom may replace Grey on the heels of a shakeup at the media company, which owns Paramount, Nickelodeon and Comedy Central. On Saturday, Viacom announced a settlement with controlling shareholder Sumner Redstone, by which its Viacom CEO Philippe Dauman had been replaced by his longtime right-hand man, Chief Operating Officer Thomas Dooley. Dooley will be interim CEO until Sept. 30, the end of Viacom’s fiscal year.Under the settlement, Dauman will stay on as non-executive chairman through Sept. 13 and be allowed to present to the Viacom board his plan to sell a 49-percent stake in Paramount Pictures.  As Reuters first reported in July, Chinese real estate and entertainment conglomerate Dalian Wanda Group has held talks with Viacom about acquiring the Paramount stake.Since the settlement was announced, industry insiders have been speculating that Viacom may decide to replace Grey as head of Paramount.

471,"   By Ross Kerber and Jessica Toonkel | CANTON, Mass.  CANTON, Mass. The granddaughter of Viacom Inc's controlling shareholder Sumner Redstone has agreed to let a Massachusetts court dismiss claims brought by former company leaders, a step that will help end a battle over the fate of the media empire.Lawyers for Keryn Redstone said at a Massachusetts court hearing on Friday they have also agreed to mediate remaining parts of her family dispute and that she will have an in-person meeting with her 93-year-old grandfather.""There will be peace in the Redstone valley"" said Keryn Redstone's attorney Pierce O'Donnell, speaking to reporters after the hearing at Norfolk County Probate and Family Court in Canton, Massachusetts. Keryn Redstone's interest in a family trust is worth $1 billion, he said.While some terms must still be hammered out, Friday's agreements will help end an ongoing legal saga over whether Redstone was mentally competent when he removed former Viacom CEO Philippe Dauman and board member George Abrams from a trust that will determine the fate of his media empire. On Saturday, Viacom announced that it had come to an agreement with Redstone, and his privately-held National Amusements Inc, which owns 80 percent of the voting shares of Viacom and CBS Corp [nL1N1B10MX}. Dauman has stepped down as CEO and will receive as much as $90 million in cash and stock-based compensation, according to the agreement.  But Keryn Redstone, who is Shari Redstone's niece and was replaced as a trustee in 2012, had challenged the validity of the settlement agreement because she believes her grandfather is being manipulated by his daughter Shari. Under the settlement, the board of Viacom added the five directors that National Amusements put forward in June, bringing the board to 15 directors after Dauman departs. Three of those directors are expected to step down after Viacom's annual meeting next year, a source familiar with the situation told Reuters last week.Despite that settlement, Keryn Redstone filed a cross-complaint in connection to Dauman's lawsuit. In a filing on Thursday she also questioned if Dauman's side did enough to assure themselves that Redstone had the mental capacity to understand the terms.Friday's court hearing drew about two dozen lawyers representing the various Redstone family members plus Dauman, Abrams and others. A morning session included heated moments as it became clear that most of the family was looking to end the litigation, while O'Donnell sought to raise questions about Redstone's mental capacity. Sumner Redstone has not spoken on an investor call since 2014 and has not spoken directly about the settlement since it was announced this month.Attorney Robert Klieger portrayed Sumner Redstone's health as stable, saying the aging media mogul has had ""no recent hospitalizations.""  There is, Klieger said, ""No reason to believe that Mr. Redstone will not still be here with us for the duration of this case on any reasonable schedule.""

489,"  Sept 25 Shares of CBS Corp could jump 30 percent in the next year, double in the next three or do even better if the network successfully attempts to buy Viacom Inc  at an attractive price, a report in Barron's said.Viacom, which last week said it its interim Chief Executive Tom Dooley will depart in mid-November and that the company will keep movie studio Paramount Pictures, appears to be tidying itself up for a sale and the most natural buyer would be CBS, Barron's said in its report. Should CBS Chief Executive Leslie Moonves make a run at Viacom, he would have considerable leverage over the terms of a deal because CBS' growth prospects are as bright as Viacom's are dreary, Barron's said.  But because of CBS' longtime ratings lead and preference for owing its own shows, the network can thrive as a stand-alone company, according to Barron's.

490,"   By Jessica Toonkel and Greg Roumeliotis  Sumner Redstone's National Amusements Inc is preparing to call on CBS Corp (CBS.N) and Viacom Inc (VIAB.O) to explore a merger, two people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.National Amusements is the controlling shareholder of both media companies, which separated from each other 10 years ago.A merger would give Viacom, whose networks include Comedy Central, Nickelodeon and MTV, a seasoned media executive at the helm in CBS CEO Leslie Moonves at a time when its TV ratings and ad revenue are in decline, many investors believe.The possible benefits for CBS are less clear, beyond the company gaining scale, which could help with negotiations with cable and satellite distributors. CBS's ratings and ad revenue have been strong over the past few years and Moonves has resisted the idea of a recombination, other people familiar with the situation have said.Investors tentatively welcomed the prospect of a deal, if only to end the uncertainty that has hovered over the companies for the past two years as the ailing 93-year-old Redstone has become less involved in their operations. “We would like to see CBS continue on its path of success and bring Viacom along with the ride,” said Michael Cuggino,  president at San Francisco-based Permanent Portfolio Family of Funds, which owns voting shares of CBS and Viacom. He said his enthusiasm for a deal would depend on the details.A merger could save $400 million in costs between the two companies and give them greater clout in the consolidating world of television, according to Michael Nathanson, senior analyst at MoffettNathanson Research.Viacom shares jumped as much as 7 percent after Reuters exclusively reported National Amusement's plans, and ended trading up 3 percent at $36.56, giving the company a market value of $14.7 billion. CBS shares closed up 4 percent at $54.15, indicating a market value of just over $24 billion.SPECIAL COMMITTEES  A combination of CBS and Viacom would be the latest example of a deal between two companies with high-profile owners in common. Elon Musk is the largest shareholder in both Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA.O) and SolarCity Corp SCTY.O, which announced a deal in August. A month earlier, Larry Ellison's Oracle Corp (ORCL.N) said it would buy NetSuite Inc N.N, 40 percent of whose shares are controlled by Ellison.In both those cases the companies formed special board committees to explore all transactions available to them before agreeing to a deal. National Amusements may contact CBS and Viacom as early as this week to ask them to form such independent board committees, one of the sources said.The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Representatives for National Amusements, Viacom and CBS declined to comment. National Amusements, the privately held movie theater company owned by Redstone and his daughter Shari Redstone, own 80 percent of the voting shares of Viacom and CBS.Viacom was spun off from CBS in 2006, but Shari Redstone has been in favor of recombining the two under the leadership of Moonves, sources have previously told Reuters.Industry speculation that the two might tie up has increased over the past few weeks, after the Redstones prevailed over a power struggle that resulted in the departure of Viacom Chief Executive Officer Philippe Dauman.CBS DOUBTS, VIACOM STRUGGLES   However, Moonves has previously indicated he is not warm to the idea. ""We are never going to do something that is bad for CBS shareholders,"" he told investors at a Bank of America Merrill Lynch investor conference earlier this month, adding that the two companies were not ""in active discussions.""Last week, Viacom, which has more than $12 billion in debt, slashed its dividend by half to 20 cents per share and said it expects a fourth-quarter adjusted profit of 65 to 70 cents per share. Analysts on average were expecting 89 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Viacom, which also owns Paramount Pictures, announced last week that its interim CEO, longtime Viacom executive Tom Dooley, would be leaving in November, opening a gap at the top of the company as its board navigates the way forward.Merging Viacom back into CBS is the most logical solution, particularly for Sumner Redstone, who is known to be very attached to pieces of Viacom, particularly its Paramount studios, according to Mario Gabelli, whose firm is the second-largest owner of voting shares of both Viacom and CBS after Redstone.Gabelli would not say whether he favors a deal. ""It's always a question for my clients as to 'What do I get?,"" he said. Despite Viacom's recent issues, there is still a lot of value in the company, he said.""It's a fixer-upper,"" said Gabelli. ""It's like prime real estate on a beach overlooking a bluff in East Hampton, but the house sucks."" (Reporting by Jessica Toonkel and Greg Roumeliotis in New York, Additional reporting by Liana B.

494,"   By Lisa Richwine and Jessica Toonkel | LOS ANGELES/NEW YORK  LOS ANGELES/NEW YORK Eleven years ago, media mogul Sumner Redstone declared ""the age of the conglomerate is over"" as he prepared to split old-school broadcaster CBS from the fast-growing Viacom Inc (VIAB.O) cable networks and the Paramount film studio. Now, the Redstone family's National Amusements, the controlling shareholder of Viacom and CBS Corp (CBS.N), wants the companies to consider stitching the pieces back together. News of a possible reunion, first reported by Reuters, sent shares of both companies higher on Wednesday.In the intervening decade, options available to viewers have exploded. Digital streaming expanded video beyond the living room, making it possible to watch TV shows and movies virtually anywhere on phones and tablets. Customers started ditching cable packages with hundreds of channels. And YouTube hooked younger viewers with short videos by self-made stars.Those drastic shifts now make a better case for reuniting the companies, an argument that National Amusements pitched to the boards of both companies in a letter on Thursday.A merger ""would allow the combined company to respond even more aggressively and effectively to the challenges of the changing entertainment and media landscape,"" the letter read, without going into further detail. Spokespeople for CBS and Viacom had no comment on the matter on Thursday beyond earlier statements acknowledging receipt of the letter. Conventional wisdom has held a re-merger would be more beneficial for struggling Viacom. But the combination could help both companies better compete with a massive increase in online programming that has shaken traditional business models, and to secure better terms from bigger-than-ever pay TV operators that remain the dominant distributors of programming, Wall Street investors and analysts said.""Content companies are getting squeezed from both sides,"" said Salvatore Muoio, whose investment firm is a top owner of voting shares of both Viacom and CBS. ""There have been big mergers on the distribution side, so they are dealing with behemoths in negotiations, while at the same time viewers are cutting the cord because they don't want to pay for cable anymore.""The distributor tie-ups - such as Charter Communications Inc's (CHTR.O) purchase of Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks, and AT&T Inc's acquisition of DIRECTV - provide those companies with a stronger hand when hammering out deals to pay for programming from producers like CBS and Viacom.  PROS AND CONS  A CBS-Viacom merger would have to be cheap enough for CBS shareholders but not at too much of a discount for Viacom investors, Muoio said.Analysts also said there are valid arguments that a combination may not be a good option. One major question is whether CBS Chief Executive Leslie Moonves wants to plunge into pulling Viacom's channels out of a ratings slump.""It is unclear if Mr. Moonves would undertake such a turnaround project and spread his time across a bigger portfolio of assets when he is in a relatively strong position competitively with one major asset,"" Barclays analyst Kannan Venkateshwar said in a research note.When Redstone separated his media empire, many investors viewed CBS as a slow mover catering to an older audience, compared to the young, scrappy Viacom with hot networks including Nickelodeon and MTV. Viacom appealed to growth investors and CBS to value investors. But it was CBS that turned out to be the Redstone company that thrived. Its shares have handily outperformed Viacom's over the past five years, more than doubling in value while Viacom shares are trading slightly lower.Moonves, regarded as one of the best programmers in Hollywood, could help revitalize Viacom's networks, Wedbush Securities analyst James Dix said.For CBS, joining with Viacom could provide it with new content for the CBS All Access streaming service, the company's play for younger, cord-cutting consumers, said Edward Jones analyst Robin Diedrich. CBS could tap Paramount's film library, which includes the ""Mission: Impossible"" franchise, as well as kids' shows such as ""SpongeBob SquarePants"" from Nickelodeon. CONGLOMERATES REBORN  When the companies split, it was a time of dismantling among media giants built over several decades that had become unwieldy. That was the background for Redstone's declaration that conglomerates were dead at the 2005 Allen & Co media conference in Sun Valley, Idaho.Now that distributors like Charter and AT&T have gone through their wave of consolidation, reuniting Viacom with CBS, which also owns Showtime and the CBS Sports Network, could give the combined company more leverage when it negotiates the monthly fees they earn from those and other pay TV operators, analysts said.The two companies' channels deliver 23 percent of total viewers but are paid only 14 percent of affiliate fees, according to MoffettNathanson analyst Michael Nathanson. ""CBS and Viacom together should get closer to their fair share,"" he said in a research note. There is no guarantee the companies' boards will support a combination. Moonves, speaking earlier this month at a Bank of America Merrill Lynch investor conference, indicated he is not warm to the idea. ""We are never going to do something that is bad for CBS shareholders,"" he said when asked about a potential tie-up.

506,"   By Jessica Toonkel and Greg Roumeliotis  CBS Corp (CBS.N) Chief Executive Leslie Moonves is planning to seek autonomy from the Redstone family, the broadcaster's controlling shareholder, in leading the company if it merges with Viacom Inc (VIAB.O), two people familiar with the matter said.While there is no certainty that CBS and Viacom will agree to a merger, Moonves is seeking to capitalize on his 10-year track record at the helm of CBS to gain as much influence as possible over the combined company, the people said on Monday.The 67-year-old media executive is deliberating his options with advice from famed Wall Street lawyer Martin Lipton, the people said. Lipton's law firm, Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, has been a long-time advisor of CBS. Negotiations between Moonves and National Amusements Inc (NAI), through which the Redstones own an 80 percent stake of CBS and Viacom, have not started in earnest, and the exact terms that he will be asking for are not clear, the people said.The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is not public. A CBS spokesman declined to comment. National Amusements and Lipton did not return calls for comment. Moonves would not be the first CEO of a media company controlled by the Redstones to seek such assurances for autonomy. Viacom's former CEO Philippe Dauman was on the board of National Amusements as well as a member of the seven-person trust that takes over Sumner Redstone's stake in National Amusements after he dies or is declared incapacitated.

523,"   By Malathi Nayak | NEW YORK  NEW YORK AT&T Inc's upcoming DirecTV Now online video service will cost $35 per month, including mobile streaming costs, and target viewers who shun pay-television subscriptions, Chief Executive Randall Stephenson said on Tuesday.The wireless company's streaming video service, which launches late next month, will have more than 100 channels, Stephenson said at the WSJ.D Live conference in California. AT&T said on Saturday that it would buy Time Warner Inc for $85.4 billion, as it looks to diversify its business into the media and entertainment market.The Time Warner deal gives AT&T control of cable TV channels HBO and CNN, film studio Warner Bros and other coveted media assets. Time Warner content will be incorporated into the upcoming video service, Stephenson said. ""Thirty-five dollars, you don't find that for a hundred channels in the marketplace, with wireless streaming,"" Stephenson said. AT&T is betting big on mobile video to tap new revenue as the U.S. wireless market stagnates. AT&T acquired DirecTV for $48.5 billion in 2015, making it the largest U.S. pay-TV operator with 25.3 million video subscribers. AT&T is entering a crowded market that services viewers who increasingly consume video online rather than through cable and satellite television services. Dish Network Corp's Sling TV offers about two dozen channels for $20 a month, while Sony Corp's PlayStation Vue has packages as big as 100-plus channels for $55 a month.Online video service Hulu will roll out a new live TV bundle of broadcast and cable network channels early next year.

The lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, says Redstone cashed in stock options and restricted shares of Viacom and CBS in order to give $45 million each to Manuela Herzer and Sydney Holland. That triggered additional tax liabilities of over $90 million, the lawsuit said, forcing Redstone to borrow from National Amusements.

525,"   By Dan Levine  Media mogul Sumner Redstone on Tuesday sued two ex-girlfriends for civil claims including elder abuse, alleging he was forced to borrow $100 million from the private company that holds his voting shares of CBS Corp and Viacom Inc to cover tax obligations on gifts he gave to the women.The lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, seeks about $150 million that Redstone's lawyers say he gave to Manuela Herzer and Sydney Holland. Redstone's lawsuit is the newest front in a nearly year-long litigation war between the 93-year-old billionaire former Viacom chairman and Herzer.  Ronald Richards, an attorney for Herzer, said the lawsuit has no merit. ""All of the gifts Mr. Redstone made to my client and to Sydney Holland were made with his full knowledge and blessing,"" he said. Holland, in a statement, called the lawsuit ""fictional revisionist history."" Redstone’s attorneys and doctors ""vetted and approved all payments"" she received, the statement said.   Herzer had challenged her removal as Redstone's designated healthcare agent last year, saying Redstone was not competent to make the decision. A Los Angeles judge dismissed Herzer's case in May, saying Redstone made it clear in a videotaped deposition that he did not want Herzer making decisions about his care. Herzer has appealed that ruling.In the lawsuit filed on Tuesday, Redstone says Herzer and Holland engaged in a years-long scheme to drain his wealth by running up credit card bills, selling stock and changing his estate plan.National Amusements owns 80 percent of the voting shares of  CBS and Viacom, but the media mogul controls stock options and other shares of the companies, the lawsuit said. Herzer and Holland persuaded Redstone to sell those assets, which generated about $100 million in after-tax income, the lawsuit said. Redstone then gave $45 million each to Herzer and Holland.However, this triggered matching tax obligations of more than $90 million, the lawsuit said. Redstone then had to borrow $100 million from National Amusements to cover it, the lawsuit said, ""because Holland and Herzer had cleaned out Redstone's bank accounts."" The lawsuit also cites several emails from a Redstone nurse saying that Herzer and Holland continually berated him and falsely said his family did not want to visit. Herzer's attorney, Richards, said Redstone is now being manipulated by his family, and Herzer hopes his true mental state will emerge during the course of the lawsuit.
