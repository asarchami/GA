0,"  By Ross KerberBOSTON Jan 13 A rash of data breaches at big U.S. retailers may accelerate spending on high-tech payment cards, a MasterCard Inc executive and other industry specialists said on Monday, as companies look to keep the faith of their customers.Retailers and their banks face a deadline set by payment networks Visa Inc and MasterCard of October 2015 to accept new payment cards that store information on computer chips rather than on traditional magnetic stripes. The multibillion-dollar safety upgrade has many companies dragging their feet, and analysts estimated only 60 percent of U.S. sales terminals would meet the schedule.Now the loss of customer data reported at Target Corp, Neiman Marcus and other stores since December could move companies to the new standard more quickly, said Carolyn Balfany, head of U.S. product delivery for MasterCard in a telephone interview on Monday.The risks created by the breaches will clarify to companies the benefit of moving quickly to the new standard, she said. ""That's the clarity,"" she said.Among companies that could profit from a faster switch to chip-based cards are those that make equipment used to swipe them, such as the United States' VeriFone Systems Inc  and France's Ingenico.MasterCard, of Purchase, N.Y., is the second-largest payment network operator behind Visa of Foster City, California. Visa has not made executives available to be interviewed since Target first reported its breach on Dec. 19.A response gaining attention among security specialists has been the conversion of U.S. sales terminals to a card standard widely used in Europe and Asia, sometimes known as ""EMV"" after the initials of its creator companies Europay, MasterCard and Visa. Cards meeting the standard carry chips to make them harder to counterfeit, and to protect sensitive data with encryption. They can also require users to enter a personal identification number, or PIN, to make purchases, an extra layer of security compared to the signatures used by traditional credit cards.Although the new technology may not have prevented the data thefts from Target and elsewhere, it would make any stolen data harder to re-use and has cut fraud where it has been adopted.BANKS AND RETAILERS AT ODDS  In an interview with CNBC on Monday, Target Chief Executive Gregg Steinhafel said the company wanted to lead the retail industry's move to adopt the new cards. His remarks echoed those made by the general counsel of the National Retail Federation on Sunday. [ ID: nL2N0KN110 ]To date U.S. banks and retailers have been at odds over who should bear the costs of the upgrades, which could approach $10 billion in all. Retailers have made headway with a federal lawsuit that could help them reduce the fees that banks can charge to process transactions - fees the banks had counted on to pay for new technology. [ ID:nL2N0K004A ]The new enthusiasm from retailers like Target and the trade group after the breaches could mean they will install the equipment more quickly, said Roel Schouwenberg, a senior cyber security researcher for Kaspersky Lab.

2,"  * Challenge to EU ban on transaction fees dealt blow* Adviser to top court says firm's appeal should be dismissed* Move may bolster EU regulatory clampdown* MasterCard says interference will push up consumer costsBy Foo Yun CheeLUXEMBOURG, Jan 30 MasterCard's five-year battle to keep multi-billion-euro cross-border card fees was dealt a blow on Thursday when an adviser to Europe's top court backed efforts to reduce such charges.The legal opinion follows a European Commission ruling that said MasterCard's cross-border ""interchange"" fees - levied on retailers' credit and debit card transactions - broke antitrust rules and had to be changed.Mastercard challenged this but the court adviser's recommendation now means it is likely to fail.The EU antitrust regulator says such fees cost businesses across Europe 10 billion euros ($13.64 billion) a year.Many consumer rights campaigners argue these hidden costs, charged when banks process payments by, for example, a German visiting London, are passed on to the consumer. ""I propose that the court should dismiss the main appeal (by MasterCard) and the cross-appeals,"" Advocate General Paolo Mengozzi at the EU Court of Justice said in his opinion.The court, which will issue its judgement in the coming months, follows such advice in the majority of cases.The opinion represents a setback to the world's second-largest credit and debit-card company after Visa. Mastercard says such interference would actually lead to higher costs for consumers and encourage the black economy.The advice may also bolster support for proposed European Union rules to cap charges on card payments that have yet to be approved by EU countries and the bloc's parliament.That crackdown is part of the Commission's push to boost e-commerce in the 28-country bloc and reduce costs for business. Interchange fees are collected and kept by banks processing payments using cards. While MasterCard does not benefit directly from the charge, it fears a crackdown will discourage lenders from issuing its cards.COMPETITION MasterCard, which faces increasing competition from rival payment schemes such as eBay's PayPal, was critical of the decision. ""Practical experience in countries such as Spain, Australia and the United States shows that capping interchange shifts the costs for transactions from retailers on to consumers,"" MasterCard President Javier Perez said in a statement.""A one-size-fits all approach to interchange across Europe will drive the cost of cards up for consumers ... and ignores the very different market realities across European countries,"" he said.EU retail lobby EuroCommerce, whose 1997 complaint triggered the first regulatory investigation into MasterCard, welcomed the recommendation.""This should be another reason for the European Parliament to go forward with regulation on interchange fees,"" said Ruth Milligan of EuroCommerce.MasterCard has said the value of cross-border card transactions is less than 5 percent of all purchases made by cardholders. A lower court threw out its challenge in 2012.In the long-running dispute with the European Commission about such charges, MasterCard has made some concessions.It agreed to reduce its debit card charges to 0.20 percent of a transaction and 0.30 percent for credit cards, pending this court ruling.Rival Visa Europe, Europe's largest card network and the European licensee of Visa, has offered similar concessions.",2014-01-30,MA,"Thu Jan 30, 2014 | 9:03am EST",UPDATE 2-MasterCard suffers setback in fight to keep fees,http://www.reuters.com//article/court-mastercard-idUSL5N0L41DX20140130?type=companyNews

""We remain insistent that U.S. retailers' customers be given the same protections as consumers in more than 80 countries who have both a chip and a PIN securing their credit and debit cards,"" Duncan said in a statement.Visa and MasterCard declined to provide details on specific proposals for the technology to be used in the cards or the make-up of the cross-industry group.The American Bankers Association did not respond to requests for comment but Patrick Keefe, a spokesman for the Credit Union National Association, confirmed that the trade association was part of the industry group.""The recent high-profile breaches have served as a catalyst for much needed collaboration between the retail and financial services industry on the issue of payment security,"" Visa President Ryan McInerney said in the statement.

Robertson said the formation of the group would help push small and mid-size retailers to adopt the new technology. Banks and retailers have been dragging their feet over the upgrade, at odds over how the costs would be split.The NRF has said it could cost the U.S. retail industry about $30 billion to upgrade to chip-based cards, including equipment, training and software.""Banks and retailers want to make sure that if they invest in new infrastructure, they'll get the return in reduced fraud,"" Wedbush Securities analyst Gil Luria told Reuters.MasterCard and Visa said the group would also address security issues with mobile and online transactions. One proposed solution is for traditional account numbers to be replaced by a unique digital payment code.Target said last month it was accelerating a $100 million program to implement the use of chip-enabled smart cards to protect against cyber threats, with a goal to have the technology in place by early 2015.""In the aftermath of the Target breach, security is on the minds of executives in the way it hasn't been in a very long time,"" Robertson said.

One proposed solution is for traditional account numbers to be replaced by a unique digital payment code.Target said last month it was accelerating a $100 million program to implement the use of chip-enabled smart cards to protect against cyber threats, with a goal to have the technology in place by early 2015.""In the aftermath of the Target breach, security is on the minds of executives in the way it hasn't been in a very long time,"" Robertson said.

15,"  SHANGHAI, March 12 In UnionPay's curved glass headquarters in Shanghai's financial hub of Pudong, a plaque commemorates a visit by former Chinese President Hu Jintao in 2010. Emblazoned on it is a quote from Hu urging the company to ""step up the effort to internationalize and strive to build UnionPay into a major global brand for bankcards"".China's renminbi currency is not yet an international currency - it is not freely convertible. Yet China's official bank card has achieved Hu's dream of global dominance.China UnionPay has become the world's largest card brand with 3.53 billion cards in circulation, just over a decade after it was founded in 2002. Its $2.5 trillion in transactions in the first half of last year was second to Visa Inc's $4.6 trillion, says industry newsletter the Nilson Report.UnionPay has achieved this kind of dominance by having a virtual monopoly on bank card transactions in China, and according to its rivals, offering low fees to retail merchants at home and abroad.In China, foreign rivals such as American Express, MasterCard Inc and Visa must use UnionPay's yuan settlement network.Credit and debit card settlement is a big, profitable and growing business in China. Interbank card transactions jumped 37 percent from 2011 to 21.8 trillion yuan ($3.58 trillion) in 2012. Central bank regulations also give UnionPay the rights to settlements for all online transactions in China. UnionPay transactions overseas show equally impressive growth, rising 30 percent year-on-year in 2012, according to the official Xinhua news agency. Overseas revenue now accounts for around 5 percent of UnionPay's total, according to a Hong Kong fund manager briefed by UnionPay executives.UnionPay, which is not a public company, does not disclose financial results or details.The United States, home to UnionPay's biggest rivals, has complained long and often about its privileged status in China. In 2012, following complaints by Washington, the World Trade Organization ordered China to stop discriminating against foreign bank card rivals such as Visa and Mastercard, but did not make any specific recommendations.""A more efficient payment card system in China would be more beneficial for both merchants and consumers,"" U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk said at the time.China has yet to open the bank card market. UnionPay regularly waives fees that its rivals charge and is known for having the lowest fees in the market overseas, said the head of bank card operations at a Hong Kong-based bank who deals regularly with UnionPay.""It seems they're at an expansion phase, so anything goes,"" said the executive. ""They don't mind losing money to gain market share. Visa and Mastercard don't offer anything like that.""""When we asked (UnionPay), 'Are your international operations making a loss?' We were told: We don't look at those numbers,"" he added.UnionPay said in a written response to questions about this assertion that its overseas operations were profitable. ""UnionPay's international business growth momentum remains good, and at the moment, it remains in a profitable state,"" the company said.Third-party installers such as EasyLink have helped  UnionPay's expansion by installing its terminals in overseas retail stores.

The company produces and sells local beers in both Ukraine and Russia.""Until now it has been business as usual. We produce, sell and distribute our products to the market without problems,"" said CEO Jorgen Buhl Rasmussen. ""Our focus is on our employees and our breweries.""Lemken, a German manufacturer of ploughs and other farm machinery, has seen a big drop-off in orders from Russia, its second-biggest export market after France, in recent weeks as a sliding rouble raises their sale price.With Moscow vowing to retaliate against the West's sanctions, Anthony van der Ley, managing director of the family-run business, is taking no chances. He is sending machinery to Russia now in case the border closes or import charges are hiked.Profine, a plastic windowframe manufacturer with annual revenues of 700 million euros ($965 million), has so far managed to compensate for the rouble slide by increasing sales but won't be able to do that forever.""If there are further sanctions, that would be poison for the economic development of our partners,"" said Peter Mrosik, the German firm's managing partner. In Canada, Bombardier Inc said the airplane maker's planned joint-venture with Rostec, the Russian state-owned industrial and defense conglomerate, was likely to be delayed because of sanctions being considered by Canada and other Western countries. A related deal for Bombardier to sell 100 short-haul Q400 NextGen aircraft was also likely to be held up.Obama unveiled sanctions against members of Putin's inner circle on Thursday as well as against Bank Rossiya, partly owned by a Putin ally.In response, Visa and MasterCard, both based in the United States, stopped providing services for clients at Rossiya and another bank SMP, whose co-owners, two brothers, are also on Obama's list.Western Union Co, the world's largest money transfer company, said it had suspended services through Bank Rossiya branches but was continuing services at more than 20,000 locations and self-service terminals in Russia.SMP described the move by Visa and MasterCard as unlawful.  However, financial services firms are wary of doing business with any person or group that can be linked back to the targets. Banks have paid dearly in the past for violating U.S. sanctions on countries such as Iran.COSMETIC SO FAR What bankers and business people fear is an escalation of measures that would choke off international payments and trade, halt investments and stymie deals. Germany's main trade body warned on Friday that full-blown economic sanctions would be a ""real catastrophe"". In a worst-case scenario, Washington would stop banks doing business with Russian counterparts and corporates, similar to the sort of sanctions that were imposed on Iran.Germany's ""wise men"" council of economic advisers said this week that the Ukraine crisis was the biggest threat to growth globally, and especially in Germany, because of Russia's importance as an energy exporter.""What has been announced so far is really nothing. It's purely cosmetic,"" said a French banker based in Moscow.""The biggest risk is tougher sanctions and really the potential impossibility of transfers in U.S. dollars,"" said the banker, who declined to be named because of official sensitivity around the restrictions.******************************************************** Bank exposure to Russia link.reuters.com/xej67v Russia's main trade partners link.reuters.com/jup77vRussia's EU trade ties link.reuters.com/rup77v******************************************************** State-owned Russian banks and companies are expected to repatriate funds from overseas after Putin told them this week to bring their assets home. But foreign bankers in Russia said things would have to deteriorate further before they would reconsider their investments there.""It would have to be a lot worse than this. We are waiting for the response from the Russian side,"" said a Western banker in Moscow. ""I haven't heard of any Western companies pulling out of Russia,"" the banker added.WAIT AND SEE Even before the Crimean crisis blew up last month, international banks such as HSBC, Credit Suisse  and Barclays had pulled out of dozens of markets because the risk of falling foul of financial crime rules and sanctions outweighed the returns.The cost to banks of cleaning up an array of misdeeds that have come to light since the global financial crisis, including sanctions busting, has soared to over $100 billion.Since the U.S. and European sanctions so far focused on wealthy individuals close to Putin, private banks which cater to powerful Russians are under the spotlight.Switzerland, the global hub for private banking and a bolt-hole for wealthy Russians, has yet to impose any restrictions but its banks, such as UBS and Credit Suisse, still have to be aware of sanctions when they deal with clients.Vasili Brokvo, the head of communications for Russia's state defence conglomerate Rostec, made the corporate case for peace.""We hope and our international partners also hope that political differences over certain issues won't annul or destroy everything we've built and all previous agreements with foreign partners will be successfully implemented,"" he said on a business trip to Chile this week.

17,"  (Adds Rice comment, Canada sanctions, Moscow excludes OSCE from Crimea)* Kremlin to respond to U.S. sanctions in kind* Russian stocks plunge as investors fear wider sanctions* Visa, MasterCard stop processing payments for Russian bank* Europe looks to diversify from Russian gas, oil* EU signs deal with Ukraine, pledges financial helpBy Steve Gutterman and Adrian CroftMOSCOW/BRUSSELS, March 21 President Vladimir Putin signed laws completing Russia's annexation of Crimea on Friday as investors took fright at a U.S. decision to slap sanctions on his inner circle of money men and security officials.Putin promised to protect a bank partly owned by an old ally, which Washington has blacklisted, and his spokesman said  Russia would respond in kind to the latest financial and visa curbs after producing one blacklist of its own.His allies laughed off the U.S. sanctions, but shares on the Moscow stock exchange - which have lost $70 billion of their value this month - fell sharply after President Barack Obama also threatened to target major sectors of the economy if Russia moved on areas of Ukraine beyond the Black Sea peninsula.Obama's national security adviser said the world was reassessing its relationship with Russia and Washington was sceptical of Russian assurances that troop movements on the Ukraine border were no more than military exercises.The financial noose began tightening with Visa and MasterCard stopping processing payments for a Russian bank owned by two brothers on the U.S. blacklist. Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said Russia might cancel its foreign borrowing for 2014 and raise less domestically if the cost of issuing debt rose.European Union leaders - who like Obama insist Crimea is still part of Ukraine - imposed their own sanctions on 12 people, including Russian deputy prime minister Dmitry Rogozin and two aides to Putin. Canada sanctioned 14 people.Shaken by the worst East-West crisis since the Cold War, the EU also pledged to cut its reliance on Russian energy and signed a political deal with the pro-Western Ukrainians who took power after Moscow-backed President Viktor Yanukovich's overthrow last month.In a Kremlin ceremony shown live on state television, Putin signed a law on ratification of a treaty making Crimea part of Russia and another creating two new Russian administrative districts: Crimea and the port city of Sevastopol, where Moscow keeps part of its Black Sea fleet.Thousands of Russians marked the annexation with fireworks and celebrations in Simferopol, capital of Crimea where the  population is around 58 percent ethnic Russian.""Many people wanted this, to go back, not to the USSR, but to that big country of ours,"" said Anna Zevetseva, 32. ""We are waiting for things to improve and for investment from Russia."" Ukrainian and Tatar residents stayed behind closed doors. Sergey, a 64-year-old Ukrainian businessman who did not want to give his surname, saw no reason to celebrate. ""An occupying force is in my country and we have been annexed,"" he said.INNER CIRCLE A referendum last Sunday after Russian troops seized control of Crimea overwhelmingly backed union with Russia but was denounced by Washington and the European Union as a sham. It opened the way for annexation within a week.The OSCE European rights and security body finally agreed to send monitors to Ukraine after a delay Western members blamed on Russia, but Moscow said it would have no mandate in Crimea.Obama's decision to target people who accompanied Putin's rise from the mayor's office in St Petersburg in the 1990s to the Russian presidency deepened the diplomatic confrontation.Putin said Bank Rossiya, singled out by Washington as the personal bank for senior Russian officials, had nothing to do with events in Crimea.The St Petersburg-based bank - which is chaired and partly owned by Yuri Kovalchuk, an old associate of Putin's - mainly serves clients in Russia's energy sector including businesses owned by state-run gas producer Gazprom.Putin, who says Crimea has exercised its right to self-determination, promised to transfer his wages to Bank Rossiya. ""I personally don't have an account there, but I certainly will open one on Monday,"" he told Russia's Security Council. Others on the U.S. blacklist include oil and commodities trader Gennady Timchenko and the brothers Arkady and Boris Rotenberg, who are linked to big contracts on gas pipelines and the Sochi Olympics, as well as Putin's chief of staff and his deputy, the head of military intelligence and a railways chief.ENERGY UNION European leaders also agreed to accelerate their quest for more secure energy supplies at talks on Friday.The EU has made progress in diversifying since crises in 2006 and 2009, when rows over unpaid bills between Kiev and Moscow led to the disruption of gas exports to western Europe.  But Russia still provides around a third of the EU's oil and gas and 40 percent of the gas goes through Ukraine.European Council President Herman Van Rompuy said member states would help one another to maintain supplies if Moscow cut them. ""We are serious about reducing our energy dependency,"" he told a news conference at the end of a summit in Brussels.EU countries, which buy Russian gas individually, will also look to negotiate supply deals jointly with Moscow to increase their bargaining power. ""It is clear we need to be moving towards an energy union,"" said Van Rompuy.German Chancellor Angela Merkel raised the possibility that U.S. shale gas could eventually be an option for European countries seeking to diversify. Obama is expected to address the issue at a summit with EU leaders next Wednesday. Foreign banks and companies now fear the secondary ripple effects of the sanctions. In a worst-case scenario for them, Washington would stop banks doing business with Russian clients, similar to the sanctions that were imposed on Iran.""What has been announced so far is really nothing. It's purely cosmetic,"" said a French banker based in Moscow, adding that the biggest risk was to transfers in U.S. dollars, crucial for the energy export-dependent Russian economy.Obama said on Thursday that Washington was also considering sanctions against economic sectors including financial services, oil and gas, metals and mining and the defence industry, if Russia made military moves into eastern and southern Ukraine.In Crimea itself, Ukrainian troops who have been surrounded by Russian forces continued to leave their bases, powerless to halt Moscow's takeover of the peninsula.""The situation in Ukraine remains unstable and menacing,"" said German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier, urging the OSCE observers to take up their work as quickly as possible.EU SUPPORT FOR KIEV European governments also took individual action against Russia. Germany suspended approval of all defence-related exports to Russia, ordering contractor Rheinmetall to halt delivery of combat simulation gear, while France called off military cooperation with Moscow.In Brussels, the 28 EU leaders underlined their support for Ukraine's new leadership, signing a political agreement with interim Prime Minister Arseniy Yatseniuk.They also promised financial aid for the government - rejected as illegitimate by Moscow - as soon as Kiev reaches a deal with the International Monetary Fund.The IMF is to report next Tuesday on advanced talks with Ukraine on a loan programme that would be linked to far-reaching reforms of the shattered economy.Three months of protests were set off by Yanukovich's refusal to sign an association agreement with the EU, the political part of which was signed on Friday.Russia's MICEX stock index fell about 3 percent when trade opened, although it recovered some of the losses later. Promsvyazbank analyst Oleg Shagov said Obama had ""opened a Pandora's box full of sanctions"", with future sanctions to be ""directed against whole sectors of the Russian economy"".Negative market sentiment was reinforced by warnings from credit ratings agencies Fitch and S&P that they were changing their outlooks on Russia to negative from stable because of the possible impact of sanctions on Russia's economy and business climate. Both agencies presently rate Russia BBB.Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev made clear that Russia would step up financial pressure on Ukraine. He said the former Soviet republic should repay Moscow $11 billion under a gas supply contract that should be scrapped because it no longer applied.(Additional reporting by Alexandar Vasovic in Simferopol, Luke Baker, Justyna Pawlak, Jan Strupczewski, Barbara Lewis, Robin Emmott and Martin Santa in Brussels, Oksana Kobzeva, Lidia Kelly, Elizabeth Piper, Jason Bush, Megan Davies and Alexei Anishchuk in Moscow; Lionel Laurent in Paris; Writing by David Stamp; Editing by Will Waterman, Paul Taylor and Philippa Fletcher)",2014-03-21,MA,"Fri Mar 21, 2014 | 5:22pm EDT","WRAPUP 6-Putin completes Crimea's annexation, Russia investors take fright",http://www.reuters.com//article/ukraine-crisis-idUSL6N0MI1V020140321?type=companyNews
18,"   By Emily Stephenson | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON A U.S. appeals court upheld the Federal Reserve's controversial rules for debit card ""swipe fees"" on Friday, disappointing merchants who had argued the charges were too high.Businesses pay the fees to banks when customers use debit cards to purchase goods or services. The fees reimburse banks for costs involved in offering debit cards.At the instruction of Congress, the Fed in 2011 limited the fees to 21 cents per transaction. A U.S. district court in July 2013 agreed with a group of retailers that lawmakers intended the cap to be lower and overturned the Fed's rule.The three-member panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit sided with the Fed on Friday, saying the law's ""ambiguity"" gave regulators leeway to set a higher fee cap.""Because neither agencies nor courts have authority to disregard the demands of even poorly drafted legislation, we must do our best to discern Congress's intent,"" the panel wrote in its opinion.It said the rules ""generally rest on reasonable constructions of the statute.""The appeals panel did direct the Fed to better explain the way it treated costs to banks of monitoring transactions for potential fraud.A Fed spokesperson said the agency was pleased with the outcome.The National Retail Federation, whose members include Wal-Mart and JCPenney, and the National Restaurant Association, and other groups sued the Fed in 2011 over the fee cap. Representatives of the groups said they were disappointed with the ruling and were considering appealing the decision. ""To have fees that continue to be so unreasonable in the debit card space is detrimental to the folks that we represent as well as ultimately their customers,"" said Liz Garner, director of commerce and entrepreneurship at the restaurant group.""We are absolutely considering an appeal. Our lawyers are still kind of digging through the opinion that came out today and seeing what our options are,"" she said.The groups could appeal to the full appellate court or directly to the U.S. Supreme Court.FEE CAP  Swipe fees, also known as interchange fees, are set by Visa, MasterCard and other card networks. Before Congress intervened, the fees paid by retailers were about 44 cents per transaction.Hoping that lower fees would result in lower prices for consumers, lawmakers called for a cap in the 2010 Dodd-Frank law.They directed the Fed to set a limit that would cover the costs to banks to provide the cards, ignoring any expenses that were not tied to specific debit transactions.The Fed decided network processing fees, costs to monitor transactions for fraud and other expenses were relevant, even though they were not specifically mentioned in the law, and it incorporated them into the 21-cent cap.Merchants argued those costs went beyond what was allowed under the law. The appeals panel said Dodd-Frank's language was ""confusing and its structure convoluted"", but determined that it did leave room for the Fed to consider additional costs.Banks, which opposed capping fees and supported the Fed's defense of its higher limits, applauded the appeals court's decision.""Reasonable minds have prevailed in vacating the district court's ruling to affirm the existing rule,"" Richard Hunt, chief executive of the Consumer Bankers Association, a lobby group for banks, said in a statement.""This drawn-out fight should put on notice those members of Congress who insist upon interfering with the free market.""The panel also sided with the Fed on a rule related to networks that process debit transactions. Retailers argued the Fed did not do enough to promote competition among those networks, as Dodd-Frank required.Visa's shares were up 1.9 percent after the release, while those of MasterCard were down 2.3 percent.The case is NACS v. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, 13-5270.(Reporting by Emily Stephenson; Editing by Tom Brown)",2014-03-21,MA,"Fri Mar 21, 2014 | 2:24pm EDT",Appeals court upholds Fed's debit card 'swipe fee' limits,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-financial-regulations-fees-idUSBREA2K1CA20140321?type=companyNews
19,"   By Chris Taylor | NEW YORK  NEW YORK If you think picking stocks in a single country is tricky, imagine if your job is to find winners and avoid losers around the world.You'd have a big menu to select from, but that could also be a major drawback. Chaos in the Ukraine? Riots in Thailand? You need to be on top of how it will affect portfolios.Greg Dunn faces such challenges every day as co-manager of the $1 billion Thornburg International Growth fund, which won a 2014 U.S. Lipper Fund award for its 3- and 5-year performance in the International Multi-Cap Growth category this year from Lipper, a Thomson Reuters company. The fund racked up 23.5 percent 1-year gains through mid-March, clobbering its MSCI EAFE benchmark that lagged with 13.69 percent returns.""We are bottom-up oriented stockpickers. By focusing on finding good businesses, you don't have to pay a ton of attention to what's going on in the macro sense,"" says Dunn, who first managed domestic portfolios before taking on international markets at Thornburg.In recent years, the fund, managed by Dunn and Tim Cunningham out of Santa Fe, New Mexico, has found those values in the United Kingdom (24 percent of the fund's portfolio, as of the end of January) and Canada (9.7 percent). The managers are also not afraid of dipping into emerging markets, with 5.5 percent of the fund in Brazilian stocks and 4.2 percent in China.Top holdings include Mastercard Inc and Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. Another favorite pick: PriceSmart Inc, the largest operator of membership warehouse clubs in Central America and the Caribbean, which is up almost 40 percent over the past year.WHOLE CATEGORY GROWING Despite the wildfires seemingly lighting all over the globe these days, the international equity category's robust returns have definitely attracted investors' attention - in large part due to an extended era of fragile domestic growth.By the end of 2013, total assets in the category had leapt to $1.4 trillion, according to Lipper. That included inflows of $105 billion in 2013, the category's best year ever for attracting new cash, and a figure that crushed every other equity category. So far this year inflows have continued apace - despite a significant emerging-markets swoon in which Vanguard's Emerging Markets Stock Index ETF fell by 10 percent over the last year - with another $18 billion being added to the coffers.""With more stability in the euro zone, as well as economic recovery in places like Japan, there has been a nice bounceback for international funds in both 2012 and 2013,"" says Todd Rosenbluth, director of mutual fund research for S&P Capital IQ.One potential worry: Since international equities have notched some very impressive years, attractive values could get harder to find.But fund managers say that despite the run-up, they are still managing to locate promising companies at the right price. ""Earnings growth has gone up a lot too, so price multiples have not actually changed very much,"" says Mark Yockey, one of the portfolio managers for $12.2 billion Artisan International Fund, another of this year's 2014 U.S. Lipper Fund Award winners.Some of the top names in Yockey's portfolio: Chinese search engine Baidu Inc and German pharmaceutical giant Bayer AG. The geographic split breaks down to 18 percent of holdings in German companies, 21 percent in the UK, 10 percent in Switzerland and 12 percent in Japan.The result is 1-year returns of 18.27 percent, and eye-popping 5-year returns of 22.58 percent.How has the fund managed such consistency, in foreign markets that can sometimes be wildly volatile? Yockey singles out the taste for long-term, secular investment trends which will not be altered by the headlines of the day.""That could mean anything from the growth of the emerging-markets consumer, to environmental issues in Asia like cleaning up Chinese pollution, to expanded broadband around the world,"" he says. COMPARING NOTES The Thornburg and Artisan international funds offer an intriguing contrast in their approach to international investing, notes S&P Capital IQ's Rosenbluth.Thornburg International Growth tends to include more small- and mid-cap names, and concentrates on fewer sectors, while Artisan International sticks more to megacaps and spreads its bets between more industry sectors.But even for bottom-up stockpickers who are focused on balance-sheet fundamentals, it is a troubling world out there that remains impossible to predict. In that way, the task of an international fund manager can be likened to walking through a minefield.""There are problems in Egypt, problems in Turkey, and almost everyone seems to have problems with their currencies,"" admits Thornburg's Dunn. ""So there are definitely pressures out there. All you can do is own the highest-quality companies you can find.""(The writer is a Reuters contributor.

20,"   By Lionel Laurent and Megan Davies | PARIS/MOSCOW, March 21  PARIS/MOSCOW, March 21 U.S. and European sanctions against Russia are already having a ripple effect beyond their immediate targets, with Visa and MasterCard  halting payment transaction services for clients of a bank not even on the blacklist.SMP bank's co-owners are two of the 20 Russians targeted by U.S. President Barack Obama as he tries to punish Russian President Vladimir Putin for annexing Crimea.The lender described the move by Visa and MasterCard as unlawful. However, financial services firms are wary of doing business with any person or group that can be linked back to Obama's blacklist.Banks have paid dearly in the past for violating U.S. sanctions on countries such as Iran, and the threat of broader measures against the Russian economy should Putin threaten southern and eastern Ukraine reinforces their caution.The U.S. sanctions forced Russian billionaire Gennady Timchenko to sell his nearly 50 percent stake in Gunvor, the world's fourth-largest oil trader, this week but their direct effect has generally been relatively minor so far.What bankers and business people fear is an escalation of measures that would choke off international payments and trade, halt investments and stymie deals.

That will hit trade finance, which depends on correspondent accounts in dollars,"" said the banker, who declined to be named because of official sensitivity around the restrictions.

If a company is substantially invested here it will be difficult for them to consider getting out.""WAIT AND SEE  Even before the Crimean crisis blew up last month, international banks such as HSBC, Credit Suisse  and Barclays had pulled out of dozens of markets because the risk of falling foul of financial crime rules and sanctions outweighed the returns.The cost to banks of cleaning up an array of misdeeds that have come to light since the global financial crisis, including sanctions busting, has soared to over $100 billion.With that figure expected to climb, Western banks have so far steered clear of attempts by Iran to get them involved in financing humanitarian transactions, despite a diplomatic thaw.With the U.S. and European sanctions so far focused on wealthy individuals close to Putin, private banks which cater to powerful Russians are under the spotlight.Switzerland, the centre of international private banking and a bolt-hole for wealthy Russians, has yet to impose any sanctions but its banks, such as UBS and Credit Suisse, still have to be aware of sanctions when they deal with clients.Beyond banking, big companies such as AstraZeneca  have said they are monitoring the situation in Russia, while doubts are growing over whether smaller firms with less financial flexibility should push ahead with investments in Russia such as building factories.""They are in a wait-and-see mode.

""It's possible that they are preparing to move in,"" he told CNN.A meeting of the G7 group of industrialised nations has been hastily convened for Monday in the Netherlands to allow leaders to discuss a response to Russia's actions. Obama will also meet Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov for bilateral talks.Russia said it was complying with international agreements and had no plans to invade. It has called the soldiers who took over Ukrainian bases in Crimea ""self defence forces"". The United States and the European Union have targeted some of Putin's closest political and business allies with personal sanctions and have threatened broader economic sanctions if Putin's forces encroach on other eastern or southern parts of Ukraine with big Russian-speaking populations.Germany, which has close trade ties with Russia, said the European Union was united in its readiness to impose sanctions on Russia if necessary, and that Moscow had the most to lose.""None of us wants to escalate, but if Russia changes things unilaterally, then it must know that we won't accept it and that relations will be bad,"" Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble told German television.""VERY WORRISOME"" Ukrainian marine standards were still flying on Sunday alongside the Russian flag at the Crimean base of Ukraine's top military unit in Feodosia, but the Ukrainian troops were getting ready to leave after the Russian military takeover.""Our only issue is that we want to leave this place with honour, weapons and vehicles,"" one Ukrainian soldier said. Blinken said Washington was considering all requests for military assistance from the government in Kiev, but that it would be unlikely to prevent an invasion of Ukraine, which is not part of NATO. Breedlove said the military alliance needed to think about its eastern members, particularly the former Soviet Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia.""We need to think about our allies, the positioning of our forces in the alliance and the readiness of those forces ... such that we can be there to defend against it if required, especially in the Baltics and other places,"" Breedlove said.Breedlove said NATO was very concerned about the threat to Transdniestria, which declared independence from Moldova in 1990 but has not been recognised by any United Nations member state. About 30 percent of its half million population is ethnic Russian and more than half of the total speak Russian as a mother tongue.Russia has 440 peacekeepers in Transdniestria plus other soldiers guarding Soviet-era arms stocks. It launched a new military exercise, involving 8,500 artillery men, near Ukraine's eastern border 10 days ago.""There is absolutely sufficient (Russian) force postured on the eastern border of Ukraine to run to Transdniestria if the decision was made to do that, and that is very worrisome,"" Breedlove said.The speaker of Transdniestria's parliament has urged Russia to incorporate the region, which lies to the west of Ukraine. The new leaders in Kiev have said Moscow could seek to link up pro-Russian regions in Moldova, and Georgia to Ukraine's east, in a destabilising southern corridor with Crimea in the middle.Russia's Deputy Defence Minister Anatoly Antonov was quoted by the state's Itar-Tass news agency as saying Russia was complying with international agreements limiting the number of troops near its border with Ukraine. Moscow's ambassador to the European Union, Vladimir Chizhov,  said Russia did not have ""expansionist views"". Asked to give a commitment that Russian troops would not move into Ukrainian territory outside Crimea, he told Britain's BBC. ""There is no intention of the Russian Federation to do anything like that.""U.S. Senator John McCain, a Republican foreign policy specialist, told the same BBC show that Putin's actions in Ukraine were akin to those of Adolf Hitler in 1930s Germany.""I think he (Putin) is calculating how much he can get away with, just as Adolf Hitler calculated how much he could get away with in the 1930s,"" McCain said.""PANDORA'S BOX"" Germany's Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier underscored the huge potential repercussions of Russia's bid to redraw national borders in Europe.""I'm very worried the unlawful attempt to alter recognised borders in our European neighbourhood, 25 years after the end of the Cold War, will open Pandora's Box,"" he said.Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko, a close ally of Russia, accepted on Sunday that Crimea was now ""de facto"" a part of Russia, but said the annexation set a ""bad precedent"".Western sanctions lost some of their sting on Sunday when Russia's SMP bank, whose main shareholders were targeted by U.S. sanctions, said Visa Inc and MasterCard Inc had resumed payment services for its clients.The bank said it was glad the two biggest international payments systems had listened to its arguments to reverse Friday's suspension of services as it was wrong to target the bank, which was not itself subject to any sanctions.Putin and Russian media had mocked the sanctions, which did not stop the Russian military completing its takeover of Ukraine's military bases in Crimea. Russia's defence ministry said on Sunday that its flag was now flying over 189 Ukrainian military installations on the peninsula.The EU emphasised its support for the new pro-Western government in Kiev, signing a political agreement with interim Prime Minister Arseniy Yatseniuk last week.It also promised financial aid for the government - which Moscow says came to power by a coup to overthrow Yanukovich after he rejected an EU trade deal in favour of closer ties with Russia - as soon as Kiev reaches a deal with the International Monetary Fund. The IMF will report on Tuesday.

29,"  MOSCOW, March 26 Russia has revived plans to develop its own card payment system to cut its dependence on Visa and Mastercard after U.S. sanctions led to disruptions in their services, its finance minister said on Wednesday.Visa and MasterCard last week stopped providing services for payment transactions for clients at Bank Rossiya, which was hit by U.S. sanctions over Moscow's involvement in a crisis in Ukraine and annexation of Crimea.The two payment systems also suspended services for clients at several other banks whose shareholders, but not the banks, are on the U.S. list.They resumed services after the U.S. government said these banks did not meet criteria for sanctions. ""The payments restriction by Visa and Mastercard at one bank made us start thinking very seriously how we can secure ourselves against this kind of cases,"" Anton Siluanov said in an interview on the Rossiya 24 channel. The ""backup"" national payment system would operate only on Russian territory, he said.Siluanov said the ministry and Russian banks were preparing proposals and these would be implemented in the near future. ""Nevertheless, we believe that there is no serious reason to say that we should abandon the existing systems, especially Visa and Mastercard, but in parallel we will begin to focus more on developing our own settlement system,"" he said.St Petersburg-based Bank Rossiya faces sanctions after being described by the United States as ""the personal bank for senior officials"" of Russia.

34,"  (Repeats story published on Sunday, with no changes)* Mobile payments market seen growing threefold by 2017* Retailers spend $150 bln a year on card-based payments* Opportunity to monetise data on consumer behaviour* Mobile payments can cut retailers' costs, boost service-study* Starbucks payment/reward app already has 10 million usersBy Emma ThomassonBERLIN, April 6 Big retailers are muscling in on the likes of Visa, MasterCard and Google  in a fiercely competitive and growing mobile payment market that promises to cut transaction costs and increase customer loyalty.Stores such as British supermarket Tesco and France's Auchan hope their ""digital wallets"" - apps which allow users to pay with their smartphones rather than cash or cards - will also give them more comprehensive data about customers' shopping habits than ever before so they can target advertising.They are joining a crowded market - banks, card companies and tech firms like Google and Apple are all entering the mobile payment business, each hoping their app will become the industry standard. eBay's PayPal, well established in e-commerce, is also experimenting with the technology.Retailers hope to attract customers to their own services by giving discounts and rewards to those using them, while also linking payments automatically to loyalty schemes and offering features like saved shopping lists.The global market for mobile payments is forecast to grow about threefold by 2017 to some $721 billion worth of transactions, with more than 450 million users, according to research firm Gartner.The growth could benefit retailers as the competition from a host of payment providers should help drive down the fees stores pay to have transactions processed - a service currently dominated by banks and card firms Visa and MasterCard.""We view merchants as overall beneficiaries of the trend toward mobile payments,"" said Morgan Stanley, which estimated retailers in developed countries spent up to $150 billion in 2012 to accept card payments.""Expected returns should justify any incremental investments required in enabling mobile payments technology,"" it said in a report in January. However, it is still unclear how the retail mobile payment market will develop, with card companies and banks seen retaining a leading role in processing payments even if physical cards become obsolete.Retailers' apps might struggle to take off as customers are unlikely to be willing to use a variety of services for different stores, but the success of Starbucks Corp in combining mobile payments with promotions shows big players can succeed.U.S. RETAILERS Starbucks, the world's biggest coffee chain, launched its mobile payment and rewards app in 2011. It already has 10 million users and the firm said this month it is looking for ways to expand the programme beyond its own network.""The mobile payments platform has given us a higher degree of frequency and higher degree of loyalty and the question is how can we leverage that beyond our stores,"" Starbucks Chairman and Chief Executive Howard Schultz told CNBC television.An alternative path is also being explored in the United States, where dozens of top retailers including Wal-Mart , Target and Best Buy have announced plans to set up a joint digital wallet service - the Merchant Customer Exchange, or MCX - though no launch date has been set. Meanwhile, an attempt to create a mobile payment app universally accepted by retailers has recently launched in Germany. Yapital, owned by e-commerce firm Otto, has gone live in thousands of stores and also allows users to pay online and make peer-to-peer transfers.Yapital Chairman Nils Winkler expects just a few players to survive of the 200 initiatives now clamouring for attention in Europe, with apps tied to retailers more likely to win out than those being developed by telecom and card firms.""The biggest success in this field will be retail-based. PayPal is a good example that has grown tremendously based on the retail success of eBay,"" he said.""CLEAR BUSINESS CASE"" Tesco, the world's third-largest retailer which pioneered the tracking of customer behaviour with its Clubcard loyalty card two decades ago, will launch its digital wallet this year, as it also starts offering current accounts.That is part of the British supermarket chain's eventual plan to use smartphones - and its own-brand Hudl tablet computers - to allow customers to navigate stores with their devices and scan products to buy them as they shop. Sophie Albizua, co-founder of UK-based retail consultancy eNova Partnership, said her clients were ready to invest in overhauling outdated till systems to enable mobile payments.

Now they have time to focus on something else.""French supermarket group Auchan, Europe's fifth-biggest retailer, launched its ""Flash and Pay"" electronic wallet about a year ago.

47,"   By Tanya Agrawal  MasterCard Inc, the world's second-largest debit and credit card company, said it was extending its zero-liability policy for cardholders in the United States to include all PIN-based and ATM transactions.The move follows several data breaches at U.S. companies including one at Target Corp late last year involving the theft of about 40 million credit and debit card records.""The move by MasterCard just enhances the sense of security for people at a time when it has been shaken up significantly in recent times"", said Gil Luria, an analyst with Wedbush Securities Inc.Zero-liability protection currently covers card transactions that require a customer's signature but does not apply if an account holder's personal identification number (PIN) was used for unauthorized transactions. The new policy will take effect in October.Zero-liability protection means the account holder will not be held responsible for unauthorized transactions.

We want to give cardholders peace of mind,"" says MasterCard spokeswoman Beth Kitchener. The breach at Target last year, which affected more than 40 million customers, is still a top concern for many. For consumers who have MasterCard-branded debit cards, the extension of zero liability means some things will change, while others won't. Here is what you need to know about the new policy, which takes effect on Oct. 1.Q: Does this mean that using a debit card is just as safe for transactions as using a credit card?A: Not exactly. While those who have MasterCard-branded debit cards will benefit from the policy change, the inherent issues with debit cards remain. The main difference between debit card and credit card transactions is debit cards are tied to users' bank accounts.""With credit cards, it's not a big deal. It's their money not yours,"" says Gerri Detweiler, director of consumer education for Credit.com. ""With a debit card it is a big deal. Consumers still need to be very careful when a debit card is tied to their main financial account.""Q: How much money could I be on the hook for right now if  someone steals using my debit card?A: Federal laws extend protection to consumers using both credit and debit cards, but losses for victims of fraudulent credit card transactions are capped at $50. Most credit card issuers, however, set the cap at zero. Responsibility for fraud on a debit card is tied to when it is discovered and reported.If you report the loss within two days, federal law caps consumer responsibility at $50. If you report it within 60 days of receiving a statement that shows the fraudulent transactions, liability is capped at $500. If you don't report it within 60 days, that liability is unlimited. Q: Why isn't a PIN enough to protect me?A: Theoretically, using a PIN protects the cardholder because it's a secure password. However, card skimmers can steal numbers, and some people use PINs that are easy to figure out.Javelin Research & Strategy, which analyzes banking and fraud, found that about 10 percent of identity fraud victims had their debit card PIN taken. That works out to more than 1.2 million cards.Q. How do I get money restored to my account if it is stolen? A: You should contact your bank as soon as you learn your account has been compromised, says MasterCard's Kitchener. Call the phone number on the back of your card or the financial institution that issued the card. How quickly the money is restored varies from bank to bank.Q. What's the biggest issue for consumers when someone commits fraud with their debit card?A: Getting back the money in a timely fashion. Only about a quarter of the leading financial institutions offer to make money lost to fraud available in bank accounts the day after it is reported, according to Javelin. However, that one quarter includes some of the largest banks in the country: JP Morgan Chase and Bank of America. Q. What are the exceptions to the zero liability rule?A: There is one exclusion for exercising ""reasonable care in safeguarding your card."" Consumer experts complain that this is not very specific. ""Reasonable can have variable definitions depending on who you ask,""  says John Ulzheimer, credit expert for CreditSesame.com.Kitchener says it's up to individual financial institutions to determine what would be considered a violation of the ""reasonable care"" rule. An example, says Detweiler, would be giving your card and password to someone to buy a gallon of milk and ended up spending $200. Or writing your PIN on the card.Q. Is this policy change a good thing for consumers?A: Credit experts say that it is. ""Certainly the notion that certain transactions weren’t covered by zero liability was confusing to the consumer,"" Detweiler says. ""It's great that they're simplifying that for their customers and covering all transactions.""Given that so many consumers use debit cards as a way to control spending - using their own cash rather than borrowing on a credit card - Ulzheimer says any effort to protect users is beneficial.""By and large this is a good thing for consumers who choose debit over credit,"" he says.

52,"   By Emma Thomasson | BERLIN  BERLIN MasterCard Inc, the world's second-largest debit and credit card company, sees business booming from selling data to retailers, banks and governments on spending patterns found in the payments it processes, a top executive told Reuters.MasterCard, which handles payments for 2 billion cardholders and tens of millions of merchants, uses that information to generate real-time data on consumer trends, available more quickly that regular government statistics.""It is an incredibly fast growing area for us,"" Ann Cairns, who heads MasterCard's business outside North America, said in an interview, stressing that the company respects cardholder privacy, using anonymous data rather than personal information.MasterCard does not give figures for its information services products but ""other revenues"", which include the sale of data, grew 22 percent in the first quarter of 2014 to $341 million, outpacing the growth of total revenue dominated by payments processing, which rose 14 percent to $2.177 billion. Cairns said clients for the data include retailers, banks and governments, with MasterCard tailoring it to their needs.""Retailers are fantastic at using the data they have available about how people shop in their store, how their inventory turns over, but what they don't know is what happens outside their store,"" she said. ""The data we've got is ubiquitous across the whole market. We can help retailers see what they need to do to capture more sales.""Cairns, 57, a statistician by training who joined MasterCard in 2011 after helping manage the disposal of Lehman Brothers assets in Europe, revels in the insights real-time card data can provide, such as London's popularity as the world's top travel destination and a rise in spending on experiences such as eating out or going on holiday rather than shopping in stores. MasterCard has recorded a spike in spending in Brazil on groceries and a drop in spending on luxury goods as the price of food has risen ahead of the World Cup, she said, the kind of insight valued by companies such as Nike and Adidas that are hoping to sell $300 soccer boots during the competition.GROWTH IN E-COMMERCE, EMERGING MARKETS  While MasterCard expands in ""big data"", Cairns sees no slowdown in its traditional business of processing payments, with plenty of potential for growth as 85 percent of consumer transactions are still made by cash or cheque.""Moving money and doing it safely and securely is so deeply cared about by so many people around the world that it will be a business that has fantastic value now and for years to come,"" said Cairns, who previously worked at Citigroup and ABN Amro.London-based Cairns, whose division accounts for 60 percent of MasterCard's business, said the expansion of e-commerce and emerging markets is driving growth, noting that 2.5 billion people are still without access to financial services.She predicted that shoppers in many developing economies will leapfrog plastic cards and go direct to payment via smartphone - adding MasterCard is providing ""digital wallet"" technology to retailers and banks and does not see their own moves into the payments field as a competitive threat. She also played down the challenge from other new rivals such as Kenya's money transfer service M-Pesa, owned by Safaricom, and eBay's online payments unit PayPal, which is trying to move into physical transactions.""We run at such a sub-infrastructure level around the world. It is very difficult to replicate our network,"" she said, adding that M-Pesa had built a branch network to receive and make payments in Kenya, but that would not work in countries where there is more established financial infrastructure.""Most counties in the world have ATM networks and point of sale networks. Because they are so ubiquitous, that model won't fly,"" she said.Meanwhile, MasterCard is entrenching its technology in other emerging markets, for example developing a biometrics-based card used for benefits payments in South Africa and working with the Nigeria government on a pilot to overlay payment technology on a new national identity card.

53,"  * Local partner could help MasterCard bypass new rules* Visa says Russia's planned security deposit won't work* Rule changes part of plan for national payment system* Russia a small mkt for MasterCard, Visa but offers growthBy Alexander Winning and Oksana KobzevaMOSCOW, June 17 MasterCard Inc said on Tuesday it was seeking a Russian partner to process payments made within the country, a move that could help it bypass new rules imposed on foreign card companies in the wake of Western sanctions over the Ukraine crisis.Its main competitor, Visa Inc, meanwhile, reiterated its position that the obligation to pay a hefty security deposit to the central bank - the most onerous of the new requirements - was ""unworkable.""Both companies considered quitting Russia after President Vladimir Putin signed the rules into law in early May but said they would stay after officials showed a willingness to relax the requirements. The Russian finance ministry, the central bank and local bankers have criticised the law, which was passed after Visa and MasterCard stopped serving several Russian banks targeted by recent Western sanctions and forms part of a plan to develop a national payment system to reduce Russia's reliance on the West.Mastercard said on Tuesday it had launched a tender to find a partner to perform clearing, authorisation and settlement services for its Russian operations and that the partner should have a processing centre within Russia - another of the new requirements.""We share the goal of the Russian government to decrease the volume of cash turnover in favour of electronic transactions,"" Ilya Ryaby, director of MasterCard in Russia, said in a statement.Visa welcomed a move to delay until October the obligation to pay quarterly security deposits of 25 percent of a card company's average daily turnover in Russia to the central bank but said the requirement was still ""unworkable and goes beyond what we are willing to do."" Morgan Stanley analysts estimated in a report in May that Visa and Mastercard would be required to post around $1.9 billion and $1 billion in collateral, respectively, once the rules take effect.They said the overall earnings impact would be limited if they were to leave Russia, given that the country accounts for less than 4 percent of both companies' revenues globally. AWAITING AMENDMENTS Amendments to the deposit rules are due to be discussed in Russia's lower house of parliament later this week, and analysts expect a compromise solution to be reached.Between them, Visa and MasterCard account for over 90 percent of the credit and debit cards issued in Russia, meaning that their exit would seriously complicate the lives of many ordinary Russians.Although in terms of revenues Russia remains a minor market for both companies, the country's credit card system is developing fast and its 140 million population could offer greater growth potential than developed countries.Deputy Finance Minister Alexei Moiseev told Reuters the law would likely be amended so the government would be able to waive the requirement to demand security deposits from international card companies if certain conditions were met.""The work of international (payment) systems through a Russian services provider provides the notion of uninterrupted services and could fall under a rule to cancel the security deposit,"" Moiseev said.A spokesman for Visa declined comment on whether the company also planned to find a Russian partner to comply with the new rules.

58,"   By Andrew Longstreth  NEW YORK, July 18 - A federal judge declined on Friday to dismiss antitrust lawsuits filed against Visa Inc and MasterCard Inc by retailers who opted out of an estimated $5.7 billion class action settlement in 2012 over transaction fees.Retailers such as Target Corp and Amazon.com Inc  have accused Visa and MasterCard of fixing the fees charged to merchants each time their customers used credit or debit cards. They also alleged the two companies prevented merchants from steering customers to cheaper forms of payment.U.S. District Judge John Gleeson of Brooklyn said on Friday the lawsuits could proceed, according to Jeffrey Shinder, an attorney for some of the retailers.Shinder declined further comment. In December, Gleeson approved an estimated $5.7 billion settlement between the two credit card companies and a nationwide class of merchants over similar allegations.But thousands of retailers, including some of the biggest in the United States such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc, opted out of the settlement, complaining it was not adequate. Those companies argued the settlement offered meaningless reforms that would not help them control the costs of accepting credit cards. Many of those retailers who objected to the settlement filed their own lawsuits.A spokesman for MasterCard said in a statement that Gleeson's ruling on Friday was at earliest stage of the case. ""We look forward to putting this matter behind us and continuing to work productively with the merchant community,"" he said.A Visa spokesman had no immediate comment.The case is Payment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant Discount Antitrust Litigation - Opt Out Cases, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of New York, No. 14-01720.

63,"   By Anthony Esposito | SANTIAGO Chile  SANTIAGO Chile MasterCard Inc, the world's second-largest debit and credit card company, expects net revenue to double in Latin America over the next four to five years on strong consumer spending and a shift to electronic payment from cash, a leading executive told Reuters.In recent years, a growing middle class has driven a boom in consumer spending in Latin America and helped sustain economic growth.    ""There's much more growth here in Latin America in terms of percentage growth year over year than you have in places like the U.S. or Europe,"" Ann Cairns, the president of MasterCard's business outside North America, said in an interview on Tuesday.""The reason is you're having a combination of consumer spending (growth) and also you have a secular shift of cash to electronic payment,"" Cairns said after wrapping up a tour in the region.A lack of access to financial services throughout Latin America also presents an opportunity for MasterCard. Only around 39 percent of the population in Latin America has access to financial services, compared with almost 90 percent in high-income countries, according to World Bank data.""You have a big cross section of the population who are just pure cash-based economy. So if you can get a good secular shift to occur in places like that, then you're going to have a big change,"" said Cairns, whose international division accounts for 60 percent of MasterCard's business. MasterCard, which handles payments for 2 billion cardholders and tens of millions of merchants, should see revenue in its international division outpace growth in North America. It will grow to represent 70 percent of total business ""over the next few years"" as the company looks to incorporate another half a billion people as clients, Cairns said.The company reports only net revenue figures for its overall operations so it could not give details of how much Latin America represents. MasterCard's net income rose to $931 million in the second quarter ended June 30, from $848 million a year earlier.'STAYING IN RUSSIA'  Russia is another market with huge revenue possibilities for MasterCard and its competitors.MasterCard and its larger rival Visa Inc had considered quitting the Russian market after President Vladimir Putin signed a law that would have forced the two companies to deposit $2.9 billion in collateral to keep operating in the country. But Russian officials have shown willingness to relax the requirements. They have said that if the two companies can find local processing partners by the end of October, they may be able to avoid paying the collateral.""Russia is a great economy ... It's a very highly cash-based economy, probably over 90 percent cash, and if you look at the size of the population and the wealth, it's got great growth potential for the future as well. So, we're definitely staying in Russia,"" Cairns said.In June, MasterCard said it was seeking a Russian partner to process payments made within the country, a move to help it bypass the new rules imposed on foreign card companies in the wake of Western sanctions over the Ukraine crisis.""What we're doing is assessing the future in terms of how we want the shape of the processing to look, in terms of the domestic partnerships, and we've actually worked with different banks in the market to assess capabilities and how we would partner up.""

65,"   By Foo Yun Chee | BRUSSELS  BRUSSELS Europe's top court will rule on Thursday whether MasterCard's (MA.N) cross-border card fees, a lucrative revenue source for the financial industry and the subject of a decade-long battle with EU regulators, are anti-competitive.Regulators on both sides of the Atlantic have cracked down on so-called payment card interchange fees, saying they are too high and cost consumers and retailers billions of euros a year.While Thursday's ruling applies only to MasterCard and its cross-border fees within the European Economic Area, it could set the tone for attempts to cap similar charges for card payments across the board within Europe.MasterCard's regulatory troubles started in 2003 when the European Commission said its cross-border fees within Europe hampered competition. Four years, later the commission ordered MasterCard to withdraw them.The fees are set by payment card companies and collected by banks. When a Spanish credit card is used in a French store, for example, the bank used by the French shop owner has to pay the bank in Spain a percentage of the transaction.The Commission ruled that such fees inflated prices merchants charged customers to accept payment cards, and this restriction on price competition harmed companies and consumers. MasterCard temporarily withdrew the fees in 2008 but came to an agreement in 2009 to charge them again, but with caps of 0.2 percent for debit cards and 0.3 percent for credit cards.The company's bigger rival Visa Europe agreed to similar limits on cross-border card transactions within Europe earlier this year to settle an EU investigation. Thursday's ruling is the end of long legal road. MasterCard challenged the initial European Commission 2007 ruling in a lower court, and lost in 2012. It then went to the Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ).  In January, an ECJ adviser backed the Commission's push to cut such charges. While the opinion is non-binding, judges follow such recommendations in most cases. While MasterCard's capped fees for cross-border transactions should not be affected if it loses the case, such a ruling could encourage regulators pushing for similar caps across the board in Europe, in a bid to boost e-commerce and cut business costs.In July 2013, European financial regulators proposed 0.2/0.3 percent caps for all cross-border card transactions, as well as for payments in the same country a card was issued. The proposals have yet to be approved by the European Parliament and the 28 EU countries and could still be modified due to heavy lobbying from banks and other parties.Britain's Competition and Markets Authority is also investigating fees charged by MasterCard and Visa for domestic card payments. It has put its inquiry on hold, pending the outcome of Thursday's MasterCard ruling.MasterCard handles payments for 2 billion cardholders and tens of millions of merchants.

Most were debit cards.RuPay's share of daily card transactions, however, remains small compared with the global firms, which are more established, offer both debit and credit cards and are accepted by more retailers. RuPay currently offers only debit cards.RuPay users account for just 1.5 percent of daily card transactions of almost one million at retailers, said A.P. Hota, chief executive of the National Payments Corp of India (NPCI), which runs RuPay.Hota told Reuters the payments network was set to grow rapidly from the government's so-called financial inclusion scheme, which aims to ensure the majority of households has a bank account within months. Under the scheme launched late in August, Indians who open a bank account for the first time automatically get a RuPay card.Hota said the number of RuPay users has now almost doubled from 23 million at the end of July.By March next year, he expects that number to rise to 160 million, with more than 60 percent of the increase coming from the government scheme. ""Jan Dhan itself would provide a big opportunity for the domestic card brand to be a formidable force,"" said Hota, referring to the financial inclusion scheme, Jan Dhan Yojana, which means People's Wealth Scheme.""(RuPay Card transactions are) just a drop in the ocean at the moment. But drop by drop we are increasing our size.""NPCI is also trying to lure more customers by charging banks lower fees than Visa and MasterCard, Hota added.Visa, the world's largest credit and debit card company, declined to give its India market share, but said the country was amongst the world's fastest-growing payments markets. ""We believe Visa is well-positioned competitively,"" Uttam Nayak, group country manager of India and South Asia, at Visa, said in emailed comments, adding his company welcomed competition.MasterCard did not reply to Reuters' requests seeking comment.NPCI's shareholders include India's biggest bank, the State Bank of India, and foreign lenders Citibank and HSBC.

76,"  (Adds details, shares)Oct 15 American Express Co, the world's largest credit card issuer, reported an 8.1 percent rise in quarterly profit due to higher spending by U.S. customers using its credit cards and a rise in its net interest income.Spending by U.S. holders of AmEx cards rose 9 percent in the third quarter, boosting profit in the business by 14 percent.The business accounted for nearly three-quarters of the company's profit.U.S. consumer spending rose 0.5 percent in August after being unchanged in July, the Commerce Department said last month. AmEx, which issues its own cards unlike Visa Inc and Mastercard Inc that work through banks, benefits from its largely affluent customer base and low rates of default.However, single-digit growth in spending by its card users for about two years has pushed the company to launch products such as a fee-free card that targets a wider range of customers. The company's net income rose to $1.48 billion, or $1.40 per share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30 from $1.37 billion, or $1.25 per share, a year earlier.Net interest income rose 8.7 percent to $1.4 billion. However, total revenue, net of interest expense, remained nearly unchanged at $8.33 billion.Chief Executive Kenneth Chenault said AmEx's revenue was growing at a pace below the company's long-term target. ""While the economy is stronger, it is not growing as fast or as steadily as most people would like,"" he said in a statement.Analysts on average had expected a profit of $1.36 per share and revenue of $8.35 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.AmEx's shares closed at $80.93 on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday.

77,"   By Francisco Alvarado | FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.  FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. Oct 23 A key witness in the federal tax evasion trial of a top Swiss bank executive took the stand on Thursday to testify against his former boss, Raoul Weil, who is accused of conspiring to conceal up to $20 billion in U.S. taxpayers' assets in secret offshore accounts.The former head of the wealth management division for the Americas at UBS , Martin Liechti, began testifying on Wednesday against Weil, 54, the highest-ranking foreign banker to be charged in the U.S. government's legal campaign to stamp out offshore tax evasion.Several of Weil's former colleagues have already revealed the lengths to which UBS bankers went to avoid being caught, including using a computerized card game to mask secret, hidden laptop hard drives or handing over to a client thousands of dollar bills in interest, wrapped in a newspaper.The trial of Weil, a Swiss citizen, is closely watched because it comes as UBS and other Swiss banks struggle to put behind them their pasts as willing accomplices to tax evasion and outright tax fraud. Though UBS cleared up its problems with U.S. government authorities in 2009, it faces pressure in Europe, a far larger private banking market for Swiss banks.Over two hours on Wednesday, Liechti described how he and Weil rose up the ranks of the Zurich-based banking giant to hold lofty executive positions at UBS. He also recounted how he, Weil, and other high-ranking UBS executives first learned more than a decade ago about the criminal liability they faced if the U.S. government found out they were helping American clients cheat on their taxes. After UBS acquired U.S. brokerage firm Paine Webber to increase its presence in America, Liechti said he feared an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission would expose the bank's clients who did not disclose their Swiss accounts to the IRS. ""It made the situation problematic and it was known to everybody,"" Liechti said under questioning by prosecutor Mark Daly.Liechti ended his first day of testimony by telling the jury about the 2002 closings of client booking centers in the Cayman Islands and the Bahamas because both had signed U.S. agreements to exchange bank client information. He also said the IRS had begun cracking down on credit card companies Visa Inc and MasterCard Inc to reveal the identities of card holders with offshore accounts. ""It made the business unsustainable,"" Liechti said. ""A customer who has not disclosed income could be revealed.""Liechti said Weil, who oversaw the Caribbean operations, was aware of the problem and signed off on his plan to move client assets out of the islands to Switzerland.""Everyone realized the threat was real and something had to be done,"" he said.

78,"   By Deepa Seetharaman | LAGUNA BEACH, Calif.  LAGUNA BEACH, Calif. Oct 27 Apple Inc  CEO Tim Cook fired back at CVS and Rite Aid on Monday after the drugstore chains blocked the iPhone maker's mobile payments service, saying there were plenty of other retailers around the world to sign up.Apple Pay launched about a week ago and saw more than a million credit cards registered over the first 72 hours. It already totes up more transactions than all other ""contactless"" payment methods combined, Cook said, citing Visa and Mastercard data.Such services, through which a user pays by holding a smartphone close to a specially designed terminal, have failed to catch on in the United States despite the backing of Google Inc and other influential players.News emerged over the weekend that the two retailers had opted out of Apple Pay in favor of a rival system that roughly 50 chains, including Wal-Mart and Best Buy, are developing for in-house use. ""We've got a lot more merchants to sign up, we've got a lot of banks to sign up and we've got the rest of the world,"" Cook told the Wall Street Journal Digital Live conference, in the company's most extensive comments on the blockade so far.In launching Apple Pay, the iPhone maker hopes to lock in more customers for its mobile devices by enhancing their overall utility. Industry experts say it stands a chance of becoming the first widely used payments feature on smartphones.CVS and Rite Aid have not explained their surprise move.     But the driving force behind developing a retailer-owned mobile payment solution is to avoid paying credit card transaction fees to card companies like Visa and Mastercard, analysts said. Fees range between 2 percent and 3 percent of costs per transaction. Rite Aid stopped accepting Apple Pay last week at its 4,572 stores. Spokeswoman Ashley Flower said the company was evaluating various forms of mobile payment technologies.CVS did not respond to queries seeking comment but a visit to two of its stores showed that the NFC (Near Field Communications) reader on which Apple Pay was used had been deactivated. It remains to be seen, despite early signs of success, whether mobile payments will become widely adopted.Cook argued on Monday that Apple Pay offered better security and privacy than competing services, and that retailers risked alienating customers by limiting choices at checkout.""It's a skirmish,"" Cook said in response to a question about the retailers' moves.""Merchants have different objectives sometimes. But in the long arc of time, you only are relevant as a retailer or merchant if your customers love you.""

Foreign firms that meet its criteria could set up their own clearing companies, it added, but gave no further details. It was not immediately clear if the move would allow foreign firms to process credit and debit card payments made in yuan in China.Visa, the world's largest credit and debit card company, welcomed the move.""We look forward to seeing the specific details and working with people within China to figure out what we need to do to participate in that marketplace, where we believe we can add a lot of value,"" Chief Executive Charlie Scharf said on a conference call, following the release of its fourth-quarter earnings. In July 2012, the world trade body held that China had discriminated against U.S. bank card suppliers in its electronic payments market by favouring state behemoth China UnionPay, following a complaint to the WTO by the United States.The trade watchdog found that UnionPay had an illegal monopoly on yuan payment cards issued and used in China, but rejected the U.S. claim that UnionPay was an ""across-the-board monopoly supplier"" of all yuan transactions.As the world's largest card brand with 3.53 billion cards in circulation since its founding in 2002, UnionPay's rise came at a time of explosive growth in China's interbank card market. Total bank card transactions leapt 37 percent to 21.8 trillion yuan ($3.6 trillion) in China in 2012, from 2011.China requires all foreign card companies to piggyback on UnionPay's network when accepting yuan payments.This means firms such as Visa and Mastercard must give a cut of every credit or debit card transaction to UnionPay and the card issuing bank. In most other countries, the foreign card issuers pay only the bank because they use their own network.Wednesday's promise to free a business sector is the latest step taken by China this year to free up the world's second-largest economy, albeit in vague terms.The Chinese cabinet last month also said it was freeing up the domestic courier market, potentially opening the way to competition by firms such as FedEx Corp and United Parcel Services.But that announcement, like Wednesday's, also gave no details, and it was unclear which curbs would be eased.

MasterCard's shares were up 7 percent at $81.25 in midday trading. Visa was up 8.7 percent, the biggest gainer on the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Thursday.MasterCard has a bigger exposure to global markets than Visa, deriving nearly 60 percent of its revenue from its international business.Wedbush Securities analyst Gil Luria said if the two companies were to grow at their current rate, they would need big new opportunities and China was one of them. MasterCard's worldwide purchase volume, excluding the United States, grew 12.8 percent to $554 billion on local currency basis in the third quarter.The company's cross-border volume fees rose 14 percent to $835 million.The two companies also benefited from a rise in global consumer confidence.

90,"  BEIJING Visa Inc (V.N) and Mastercard Inc (MA.N) welcome China's plans to open up its market for clearing domestic bank card transactions, as they stand to gain access to a growing market worth more than $1 trillion a year.  While China lags behind countries such as the United States in spending on credit, habits are changing fast and the Chinese are increasingly swiping plastic to satisfy their growing appetite for consumer goods.The State Council, China's cabinet, said on Wednesday after a weekly meeting that foreign firms that meet its criteria could set up their own clearing companies. It did not provide details.Visa, the world's largest credit and debit card company, welcomed the move.""We look forward to seeing the specific details and working with people within China to figure out what we need to do to participate in that marketplace, where we believe we can add a lot of value,"" Chief Executive Officer Charlie Scharf said on a conference call, following the release of its fourth-quarter earnings.Household debt in China amounted to just 37 percent of GDP at the end of July, compared with 81 percent in the United States. But the Chinese, renowned for being thrifty, are changing fast. China's total outstanding credit card balances, while less than 10 percent of household debt, were a third higher at the end of June than a year ago, according to the People's Bank of China. The amount outstanding per card has increased by more than two-thirds in two years.Mastercard, the second-largest payments company globally, also welcomes the opportunity to expand in the world's second-largest economy.""We will continue to monitor closely and look forward to the day when we can compete for domestic business in China,"" MasterCard said in a statement emailed to Reuters on Thursday. The explosion in online retailers, fueled by increasingly well-heeled youth, is adding to the allure of plastic. Access for foreign firms to China's fast-growing electronic payments market is a controversial issue. China promised to reform and free its electronic payments market after the World Trade Organization (WTO) said in 2012 that its behavior discriminated against U.S. firms.It was not immediately clear if the move would allow foreign firms to process credit and debit card payments made in yuan in China.  In July 2012, the world trade body held that China had discriminated against U.S. bank card suppliers in its electronic payments market by favoring state behemoth China UnionPay, following a complaint to the WTO by the United States.The trade watchdog found that UnionPay had an illegal monopoly on yuan payment cards issued and used in China, but rejected the U.S. claim that UnionPay was an ""across-the-board monopoly supplier.    ""As a market-orientated business, China UnionPay will operate under the same regulations as other banks, to ensure equal market competition in a way that complies with the law,"" said UnionPay in a statement emailed to Reuters on Thursday.    As the world's largest card brand with 3.53 billion cards in circulation since its founding in 2002, UnionPay's rise came at a time of explosive growth in China's interbank card market. Total bank card transactions leapt 37 percent to 21.8 trillion yuan ($3.6 trillion) in China in 2012, from 2011. China requires all foreign card companies to piggyback on UnionPay's network when accepting yuan payments. This means firms such as Visa and Mastercard must give a cut of every credit or debit card transaction to UnionPay and the card issuing bank. In most other countries, the foreign card issuers pay only the bank because they use their own network.Wednesday's promise to free a business sector is the latest step taken by China this year to open up its financial markets. The Chinese cabinet last month also said it was freeing up the domestic courier market, potentially opening the way to competition by firms such as FedEx Corp (FDX.N) and United Parcel Services (UPS.N). But that announcement, like Wednesday's, also gave no details, and it was unclear which curbs would be eased.($1=6.1107 Chinese yuan) (Reporting by Koh Gui Qing; Additional reporting by Tanya Agrawal in Bangalore and Engen Tham in Shanghai; Editing by Jacqueline Wong)",2014-10-30,MA,"Wed Oct 29, 2014 | 11:23pm EDT","Visa, Mastercard welcome Beijing's plans to free bank cards market",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-china-banks-clearing-idUSKBN0II0X920141030?type=companyNews

94,"  (Adds opposition politician, analyst comment)TORONTO Nov 4 Visa Inc and MasterCard Inc  voluntarily agreed to cut the fees they charge to Canadian retailers for credit transactions, the government said on Tuesday, adding it now sees no need to regulate fees set by credit card networks.The Canadian government said the agreement, which industry sources last week confirmed was in the works, should result in lower prices for consumers.Canadian retailers have long bemoaned the high interchange fees they pay credit card companies and banks for transactions.Unlike American Express, which typically negotiates a flat fee with every merchant, Visa and MasterCard have variable fees based on the status of their different cards. Small retailers say this hurts them as they are never sure on whether they are going to be billed 1 or 3 percent on any given transaction.Canada's Conservative government pledged earlier this year to promote lower credit card acceptance costs for merchants. And Finance Minister Joe Oliver said in September the government wanted credit card companies and banks to voluntarily agree to a deal. On Tuesday Oliver said he welcomed the decision, which will trim fees to an average effective rate of 1.5 percent for the next five years, reducing overall fees by about 10 percent.""As a result of the voluntary proposals, there is no need for the government to regulate the interchange rates,"" the government said, adding that Visa and MasterCard have agreed to start implementing the reductions no later than April.The deal was panned by Canada's main opposition party, who said the move let down consumers or small businesses and noted that Canada's Competition Tribunal had specifically called on the government to regulate the fees. ""We can't allow companies to set their own disciplinary measures,"" New Democrat parliamentarian Annick Papillon said in a statement, dubbing the government's decision a ""shameful climb-down.""BANKS MOSTLY UNSCATHED  Although the long anticipated fee reduction is likely to eat slightly into the bottom line of the Canadian banks, analysts expect a limited impact.""We believe potential changes to interchange fees represent a modest but transitory headwind to the group, with a greater impact to TD and CIBC, and the least impact to Scotia and Royal (Bank),"" Barclays analyst John Aiken wrote in a note to clients.Aiken noted there are several ways the banks can mitigate the impact of the reduction, including by increasing annual fees on cards and reducing the benefits of loyalty programs.A spokesman for Royal Bank of Canada said the bank was still assessing the impact of the changes, but was well positioned to make any adjustments required.Shares in Aimia, operator of the Aeroplan loyalty program, had been weighed down by the prospect of a lower fee structure. But the stock rose 4.6 percent on Tuesday, suggesting investors do not see the changes crimping the popular reward program offered by certain banks on some credit cards.

96,"   By Engen Tham | SHANGHAI  SHANGHAI Chinese bank card operator UnionPay, which may soon have to defend its near monopoly against Visa and MasterCard, faces a much bigger threat from online payment providers such as Alipay, and is upgrading its systems to meet the danger.Shored up by a raft of protectionist measures, the state-backed company has grown in just over a decade from an unknown name to a true heavyweight, commanding 50.6 percent of all the global cards in circulation in 2013, according to the Nilson Report statistics newsletter.China said last month it would open its credit card market to foreign players following a World Trade Organization ruling in 2012 that it discriminated against U.S. card firms.The prize for the foreign companies would be access to what is projected to become the biggest card market in the world by 2020. Transactions were already around 32 trillion yuan ($5.22 trillion) in China in 2013, according to data from the People's Bank of China.But analysts say the obstacles to a successful foreign invasion of UnionPay's dominant card position are considerable, as UnionPay charges merchants much lower rates than the Western card companies - as low as 0.04 percent, compared with MasterCard's 0.60-1.85 percent in Britain for certain cards.""The low rates in China will make entry by foreign players extremely difficult as business cases will not stack up, based on the lower rates,"" said James McKeogh, a partner in consulting at KPMG China.    A more immediate and perilous threat comes from online payment firms like Alipay, a unit of giant e-commerce company Alibaba, which already dominates a parallel and growing payment universe that rivals the traditional card set-up. ALIPAY CHALLENGE In less than three years, Alipay has grown to control nearly half of China’s online third-party payment market, tapping the hundreds of millions of Chinese still without a credit card. That market commanded gross merchandise volume of 17.2 trillion yuan ($2.8 trillion) in 2013, according to estimates from iResearch.UnionPay, on the other hand, commands a mere 11.9 percent of that market and faces competition from over 250 new online providers that have been awarded licenses from Beijing as it aims to stimulate consumer demand.Alibaba told Bloomberg on Wednesday it was open to working with eBay Inc's PayPal to expand its payment options, a plan that could magnify Alipay's reach and put further pressure on UnionPay.  With the opening of the market, Li Ye, an analyst at Analysys International, believes that with government support, Alipay could even challenge UnionPay's offline payment dominance.""Alipay is well placed to become the next UnionPay,"" said Li.UnionPay is nevertheless putting up a fight.

98,"  (Adds presidential spokesman comments, paragraph 7; updates prisoner totals, paragraph 2)* Bus, train suspension creates Crimea transport blockade* Prisoner swap follows talks on Wednesday* Visa, Mastercard stop supporting bank cards in CrimeaBy Pavel Polityuk and Alessandra  PrenticeKIEV, Dec 26 Ukraine's government and pro-Russian separatists on Friday exchanged hundreds of prisoners of war while Kiev said it would suspend all train and bus service to Crimea, effectively creating a transportation blockade to and from the region.The agreement to swap 150 Ukrainian servicemen for 222 rebels followed peace talks between envoys of Ukraine, Russia, the separatists and European security watchdog Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) on Wednesday.Ukrainian transportation chiefs said the reason for suspending train and bus service was the need to protect passengers due to a ""deteriorating"" security situation on the Black Sea peninsula, annexed by Russia in March. Crimea is controlled by Russia, but its only land link is with Ukraine and it has remained dependent on the Ukrainian mainland for most of its supplies, including much of its electricity and water. Ukraine already has banned sea and air traffic with Crimea, which is still serviced by Russian airlines.Other road transportation including passenger cars and trucks will still be allowed to travel into and out of Crimea.State rail company Ukrzaliznytsia said cargo trains would be suspended beginning on Friday, while passenger routes would gradually cease running over the weekend and on Monday. PRISONER EXCHANGE ""The head of the SBU (security service) reported the release of 146 Ukrainians to the President. The SBU expects another four prisoners to be released tomorrow. They will all be able to celebrate New Year ... with their families,"" Svyatoslav Tsegolko, a spokesman for President Petro Poroshenko, said in a Facebook post.Earlier, an SBU aide had said they would hand over 225 rebels for the Ukrainian servicemen.It is not known exactly how many prisoners are held by the two sides, but Ukraine's military said this month about 600 Ukrainians were in rebel hands. In addition, Visa Inc and MasterCard Inc, the world's two largest credit and debit card companies, said they could no longer support bank cards being used in Crimea  following U.S. sanctions imposed earlier this month.The United States last Friday prohibited U.S.-registered companies from investing in Crimea or providing services to companies operating there, among measures imposed over Russia's annexation of the peninsula from Ukraine.Russia's takeover of Crimea, an annexation Kiev does not recognise, pushed relations between Moscow and the West to their lowest point since the Cold War.Russian President Vladimir Putin has signed a new military doctrine, naming NATO expansion among key external risks, the Kremlin said on Friday, days after Ukraine made fresh steps to join the Atlantic military alliance.The uprising by separatists began a month after Russia annexed the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea from Ukraine in March, following the popular overthrow of Ukraine's Moscow-backed president. The conflict has killed more than 4,700 people.Kiev's pro-Western government has said Russia orchestrated the rebellion in Ukraine's east, a charge denied by Moscow.Violence arising from Kiev's conflict with pro-Russian separatists has been confined almost exclusively to eastern regions of Ukraine and has not affected Crimea. But the Ukrainian government has repeatedly warned of a build-up of Russian forces on the peninsula.

118,"   By Oksana Kobzeva | MOSCOW, March 27  MOSCOW, March 27 Visa still needs one or two months to transfer processing of transactions made on its credit cards in Russia to a local payment system, but Mastercard will make an obligatory April 1 deadline, the head of the payment system said.Russian authorities ordered foreign card companies to move processing of their transactions in Russia to a newly created local payment system by April 1 or put down a hefty security deposit.The new rules were introduced after Visa and Mastercard stopped providing services for some Russian banks that were sanctioned over Moscow's role in the Ukraine crisis.""With Mastercard the project is completed, all the banks are signed up. With Visa there is a fully fledged project, which has been agreed. Signing up and certifying the banks is under way,""Vladimir Komlev told journalists in comments agreed for publication on Friday.""There is an understanding of the time frame (for Visa) to complete the project, around one to two months."" Foreign card companies whose local transactions aren't processed in Russia must from April 1 deposit collateral related to the average daily turnover on their cards with the central bank to ensure Russian customers don't suffer if they halt services in the country.Komlev declined to comment on whether Visa would have to pay the security deposit, and Visa refused comment on the issue.On Friday, Visa said its cards would continue to function normally until it completely moved processing of transactions made on its cards in Russia to the local system. Russia's top lender Sberbank said transactions made on Mastercard cards it had issued would from Monday be processed by Russia's National Payment Card System, which is owned by the central bank.Rostislav Yanykin, head of Sberbank's bank cards department, said he did not know of any banks that had managed to transfer processing of Visa cards to the local payment system.""Visa is slightly more tricky than Mastercard,"" he said. ""They have an exchange protocol for cash machine operations that is much more difficult."" Komlev, the head of Russia's payment system, also said he thought the system he heads would help residents of Crimea. Visa and Mastercard late last year stopped supporting bank cards used on the peninsula Russia annexed from Ukraine.""We see a real solution to the problem of Crimea and Sevastopol in giving the Crimean people access to the National Payment Card System,"" he said.Russia's payment system plans to start issuing its own cards towards the end of 2015.

137,"   By Nadia Saleem | DUBAI, April 22  DUBAI, April 22 Somalia's Premier Bank has struck a deal with Mastercard and will issue debit cards and install ATM machines in the capital of the war-ravaged country, the Islamic lender's top executive said on Wednesday.The east African nation has struggled for more than two decades with civil war and containing an insurrection by Islamist militants which has meant even basic infrastructure has been beyond most of the country's 10 million people.Yet with al Shabaab militants driven out of the capital Mogadishu and other major strongholds, business and consumer demand has grown for services which would be taken for granted in many other parts of the world, including banking.""Somalia is a very under-penetrated market with less than 3 percent of its population banked,"" Mahat Mohamed Ahmed, managing director of Premier Bank, which received a licence from the central bank last year, told Reuters in Dubai.Carrying local currency in Somalia, a de facto dollarized economy, is cumbersome as $1 is worth 21,000 Somali shillings, and the only note in circulation is 1,000 shillings. For wealthier Somalis and visiting foreigners, carrying cash can be a dangerous task in cities rife with crime and awash with guns.Ahmed said in an interview that the Islamic lender, one of a handful of banks in Somalia, will soon start distributing Mastercard-administered debit and prepaid cards to customers. It plans to have 15,000 cards issued by the end of 2015 and says its ATM machines will also accept cards issued abroad. MasterCard's spokeswoman for Africa said it had licensed Premier Bank to go live with their cards and machines.MOBILE MONEY  However, Somali banks may struggle to convince the local population to sign up to debit cards, which might charge for withdrawals, as most Somalis use ubiquitous cheap, or free, mobile money technology to pay for goods and services.Premier has bought five ATM machines and will install them in various locations with high security in Mogadishu, Ahmed said. With a withdrawal limit of $1,000 a day, the cards can be used online and abroad.Salaam Somali Bank installed the sole ATM in Somalia in an upmarket hotel in Mogadishu last year. However, central bank sources and hotel visitors say it does not work. Salaam did not respond to requests for comment.Creating a banking system from scratch is proving problematic for Somalia. The U.S. terms al Qaeda-aligned al Shabaab a ""terrorist organisation"" and this has raised concerns in international  banking about the risk of fines if money channelled through them ends up in the hands of the militants.Premier has one of Somalia's four registered SWIFT codes but Somali lenders are struggling to build networks of correspondent banks for cross-border transactions due to fears about money-laundering and terrorist financing.""Anti-money laundering is a huge issue for dealing with international banks. They don't want to deal with Somali banks,"" Ahmed said.Somalis have traditionally dealt with informal and unregulated money transfer firms. But these money transfer firms that send much of diaspora remittances to Somalia are also struggling as correspondent banks shut their accounts, driven by the same worries about funding militant groups.Yet despite all the challenges, Ahmed believes the security improvements in Somalia have heralded huge business opportunities: ""(It) has encouraged Somalis overseas to come back and invest in the country.""

139,"   By Avik Das | April 28  April 28 MasterCard Inc's strong association with Chinese bank card behemoth UnionPay is expected to help it reap more benefits than larger rival Visa Inc  as the country opens up its $7 trillion bank card payments market to foreign players.The world's largest debit and credit card issuers have so far been barred from operating independently in the China bank card market - projected to become the world's biggest by 2020.But that is set to change.China's State Council said last week foreign firms would be allowed to apply to the central bank for licenses for bank card clearing businesses from June 1.The measure is set to end a near-monopoly held by UnionPay.It will take at least a year for foreign card issuers to start operations in China, but investor expectations are high. Shares of MasterCard and Visa rose 4 percent in the three days following the announcement.""It's pretty close ... but MasterCard has a little more leeway than Visa because of its existing relationship with China UnionPay,"" Wedbush Securities analyst Gil Luria told Reuters.The U.S. companies currently use UnionPay's network when accepting yuan payments and have to pay network access fees. MasterCard and UnionPay signed an agreement in 2010 to issue co-branded cards that Chinese people could use when traveling overseas.The agreement gives MasterCard a strong headstart, as the company has cornered a large chunk of the co-branded cards market in the past few years. (reut.rs/1HzMxVQ)Chief Executive Ajay Banga said last year that more than 90 percent of new co-branded card deals issued in China went to MasterCard. Barclays analyst Darrin Peller estimated that a 1 percent shift in purchase volume from UnionPay would boost MasterCard's earnings per share by 3-6 cents, compared with 2-4 cents for Visa.""Given that MasterCard is starting off at a smaller base, incremental growth in China may be more impactful to MasterCard's economics than Visa's over the next few years,"" Peller said.The opportunities for both MasterCard and Visa are immense.UnionPay's transaction volumes rose the most last year, according to the Nilson Report, an industry publication. Of every $100 worth of transactions swiped, UnionPay's cards accounted for $38, ahead of Visa's $37 and MasterCard's $18.Both Visa and MasterCard said they were awaiting details on how the regulations would be implemented.

The reading was the weakest in a year and lower than the 1.0 percent rate forecast by economists polled by Reuters.Investors will closely examine the Fed's statement for clues on when rates are likely to be increased, as a batch of soft data could push back the timing of a hike until the end of the year. The statement is expected at 1400 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT).""I think the GDP data has to be taken with a grain of salt,"" said Chris Bertelsen, chief investment officer at Global Financial Private Capital in Sarasota, Florida, which oversees $4.5 billion in funds.""We saw this movie last year where the first quarter was weak but followed up with a stronger second and third quarters and you're going to see the same pattern this year too."" In contrast to the weak GDP numbers, other data showed that contracts to buy previously owned U.S. homes rose in March to their highest level since 2013.At 11:39 a.m. EDT (1539 GMT) the Dow Jones industrial average was down 76.64 points, or 0.42 percent, at 18,033.5, the S&P 500 was down 9.49 points, or 0.45 percent, at 2,105.27 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 27.47 points, or 0.54 percent, at 5,027.95.Earnings released on Wednesday painted a mixed picture. ""Corporate America is very, very busy trying to create earnings that justify the current pricing of the market,"" said Dave Heidel, regional investment manager at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis, which oversees $128 billion.Heidel said the consequence of companies cutting costs to boost earnings reflects in the poor GDP numbers, which were partly due to low corporate spending.Twitter dived 5.5 percent to $39.90, a day after the company cut its full-year forecast due to weak demand for its new direct response advertising.MasterCard rose 2.6 percent to $92.63 after reporting a better-than-expected profit. The results also pushed up Visa  1.7 percent to $67.95, making it the biggest gainer among stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.Lumber Liquidators slumped as much as 21 percent to a three-year low of $26.54 after the hardwood flooring retailer said the Department of Justice is seeking criminal charges related to its imports from China.Starwood Hotels rose 8.7 percent to touch a record high of $87.80 after it said it was exploring strategic and financial alternatives.Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 1,993 to 937, for a 2.13-to-1 ratio on the downside; on the Nasdaq, 1,617 issues fell and 963 advanced for a 1.68-to-1 ratio favoring decliners.

150,"   By Joseph Ax  A proposed $19 million settlement between MasterCard Inc and Target Corp over the retailer's 2013 data breach fell through after not enough banks accepted the deal, the credit card company said on Thursday.The agreement, announced in April, would have provided up to $19 million to banks and credit unions that sued Target in federal court in Minnesota over the breach.The lead lawyers for the banks had argued that the settlement with MasterCard, which was not a party to the lawsuit, was an attempt to undercut their claims for damages.But a federal judge earlier this month rejected the banks' attempt to block the deal, though he expressed concerns about its fairness. The settlement was contingent on banks that issued at least 90 percent of the MasterCard accounts signing on to the agreement by May 20. Any bank that accepted the settlement was required to drop further claims against Target.In an email on Friday, a MasterCard spokesman said the threshold had not been met.

154,"   By Jonathan Stempel | NEW YORK, June 16  NEW YORK, June 16 A federal appeals court on Tuesday rejected American Express Co's emergency request to halt an injunction that requires the company to let merchants steer customers toward lower-cost cards offered by competitors.The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York nonetheless said it will hear American Express' appeal in the underlying antitrust case on an expedited basis.American Express is appealing a Feb. 19 decision by U.S. District Judge Nicholas Garaufis in Brooklyn, New York that its rules preventing merchants who accept its cards from recommending that customers pay with other cards, such as MasterCard and Visa, violate antitrust laws.The judge's April 30 injunction against enforcing these rules also lets merchants offer discounts, rebates and other incentives to customers for using other cards with lower fees. Garaufis has said American Express' practices wrongfully exploited the New York-based company's 26.4 percent share of purchase volume in the U.S. credit and charge card market.""We are disappointed the request for a stay was denied,"" American Express said in a statement on Tuesday. ""We will move forward to modify the non-discrimination provisions in our merchant contracts, per the trial court's remedy."" American Express has argued that enforcing the injunction would ""weaken competition and harm consumers"" in the $2.4 trillion U.S. credit card industry, and cause irreparable harm by costing it revenue and market share.It has said the February decision, if upheld, would help entrench Visa Inc and MasterCard Inc, which together have more than 1.1 billion cards in the United States versus American Express' roughly 55 million. American Express said its card holders spend three to four times more, on average. Garaufis ruled in a lawsuit filed in 2010 by the U.S. government and 17 states.Visa and MasterCard were also sued by various governments over their anti-steering rules for merchants but settled in 2011 by agreeing to make changes.Card companies charge merchants more than $50 billion a year to process consumer transactions, the U.S. government has said.The case is U.S. et al v.

165,"   By Sudarshan Varadhan and Neha Dimri  Credit and debit card issuer Visa Inc said it was in talks to reunite with former subsidiary Visa Europe Ltd in a deal that would give the global company more scale to compete with arch-rival MasterCard Inc.Shares of Visa, which also reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit as its U.S. customers spent more, rose as much as 7.5 percent to $77.11 in extended trading.Bloomberg reported in May that Visa was in talks to buy Visa Europe for up to $20 billion.Visa Inc and Visa Europe, a cooperative of European banks with over 500 million cards, were part of a global bank-owned network until 2007. Most of the units merged to form Visa Inc, which went public in 2008, leaving Visa Europe as a separate entity.Visa Europe had a 52.2 percent share of the Europe market in 2013 in terms of value of payments, according to its website. (bit.ly/1HVUjqe) A deal would give Visa access to a market with lots of growth potential, KBW analyst Sanjay Sakhrani said. ""There are many markets within Europe that are emerging markets, like Eastern Europe.""The Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa region accounts for nearly 4.8 percent of Visa's payment volumes. For MasterCard, Europe made up for about 26 percent of total purchase volume in the first quarter.Visa has call options to buy Visa Europe shares, while the European company's members have put options to sell their shares to Visa.

Visa Inc and Visa Europe, a cooperative of European banks with over 500 million cards, were part of a global bank-owned network until 2007. Most of the units merged to form Visa Inc, which went public in 2008, leaving Visa Europe as a separate entity.Visa Europe had a 52.2 percent share of the Europe market in 2013 in terms of value of payments, according to its website.

This helped AmEx report earnings of $1.42 per share instead of $1.32 per share as analysts had estimated, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.AmEx's net income attributable to common shareholders fell 5 percent to $1.44 billion as a stronger dollar cut into revenue from markets outside the United States. These markets account for about a sixth of the company's revenue.The dollar has gained about 21 percent against a basket of major currencies in the past 12 months.Shares of AmEx were down 2 percent at $77.40 in after-market trading. ""(AmEx did) better than our expectations on earnings, but people might focus on revenue being slightly weaker, though a lot of that is driven by FX,"" FBR & Co analyst Sanjay Sakhrani said.Total revenue, net of interest expense, fell 4 percent to $8.28 billion, dragged by a 9.6 percent decline in revenue from card services from markets outside the United States.Revenue from the U.S. Card Services business rose 6 percent to $4.7 billion, net of interest expense. Costs at this business rose 4 percent to $3 billion, partly driven by expenses from previously renewed co-brand partnerships, AmEx said.There is stiff competition in the industry to bag prominent ""co-brand"" deals, in which card issuers team up with prominent corporate partners - often supermarkets or airlines - to sell cards.AmEx, whose image relies on catering mainly to wealthy corporate clients, lost a couple of lucrative co-brand contracts this year because it charges higher prices than rivals.The company's exclusive tie-up with Costco in the United States will be given over to Citigroup and Visa Inc  in March. The deal accounted for 8 percent of spending on AmEx cards in 2014.AmEx said in February that the loss of the U.S. Costco contract would hurt earnings for the next two years.The company also ended a deal with JetBlue Airways.

175,"   By David Ingram | NEW YORK  NEW YORK A U.S. judge on Tuesday rejected a proposed class action settlement between American Express Co (AXP.N) and merchants who sued the company over swipe fees, ruling that a lawyer for the merchants compromised the fairness of the agreement.U.S. District Judge Nicholas Garaufis in Brooklyn, New York, ruled that lawyer Gary Friedman acted improperly by talking about the case and sharing confidential information with a friend who represented MasterCard Inc (MA.N) in a parallel class action against MasterCard and Visa Inc (V.N).Garaufis wrote that Friedman repeatedly violated court rules meant to protect confidential information and created a conflict of interest. The violations were so blatant that in at least two emails, Friedman wrote to his friend, ""burn after reading."" Garaufis ordered Friedman removed as co-lead counsel for the merchants and ordered a new round of written briefs to be filed in the case by Sept. 8.Two lawyers who represent Friedman could not immediately be reached for comment. The proposed antitrust settlement would have allowed merchants to impose a surcharge on American Express users, potentially treating those cardholders differently from other customers. Such settlements generally require court approval.Merchants were not due to receive any money from the agreement, although Friedman and two other law firms that served as co-lead counsel were due to receive $75 million in fees. American Express said in a statement it was disappointed in the ruling because it considered the settlement agreement fair. It added: ""We believe we have strong defenses against the merchants’ claims, and will continue to fight our case in court."" The case is In Re: American Express Anti-Steering Rules Antitrust Litigation, U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, No. 1:11-md-2221.

176,"  (The opinions expressed here are those of Alison Frankel, a columnist for Reuters.)Gary Friedman of the Friedman Law Group can now put a price tag on the cost of his horribly misguided decision to share privileged and confidential documents from his antitrust class action against American Express with his old friend Keila Ravelo, a lawyer for MasterCard in a parallel case: $75 million.After a ruling Tuesday by U.S. District Judge Nicholas Garaufis of Brooklyn, Friedman and his co-counsel in the Amex case are no longer in line for that $75 million.They were slated to receive the money for a settlement that permits merchants to impose a surcharge on customers who use Amex credit cards, as long as those retailers impose the same surcharge when consumers use other credit cards.The judge denied final approval of the settlement, finding that Friedman didn't provide class members with adequate representation.DEVASTATING DETAILS Garaufis' ruling adds devastating details to previously bare-bones allegations about the documents Friedman gave Ravelo.The misconduct first surfaced after federal prosecutors charged Ravelo with setting up a fake legal services company that she and her husband allegedly used to defraud MasterCard and two law firms where she had been a partner, Willkie Farr & Gallagher and Hunton & Williams.Willkie's internal investigation of Ravelo turned up evidence that Friedman had been sending documents from the Amex case to her, even as she defended MasterCard in a separate class action raising similar swipe-fee antitrust allegations against Visa and MasterCard.Merchants that didn't like the terms of the Amex settlement or the $5.7 billion settlement in the MasterCard case have argued that Friedman's disclosures tainted both deals, even though MasterCard was not a defendant in the Amex case Friedman led and Friedman wasn't lead counsel for the class suing Visa and MasterCard.Their briefs have been heavily redacted. Judge Garaufis' opinion is not. His decision shows that Friedman gave Ravelo pretty much his entire case file: confidential Amex documents (at least 33), confidential documents from members of the class he was representing (22 of those), even his own work product, including strategy memos and emails amongst his co-counsel.Friedman's lawyers, New York University law professor Samuel Issacharoff and Theresa Trzaskoma of Brune & Richard, have said he used Ravelo as an informal sounding board, to the benefit of the class. Judge Garaufis said instead that his disclosures to a lawyer for MasterCard called his loyalty to his clients into question.""Whether Friedman exchanged confidential and/or privileged materials with Ravelo and consulted with her regarding these actions for financial reasons, out of personal loyalty, due to a misplaced sense that her advice would in fact benefit the merchant class and was not improper, and/or for some other reason(s), is something this court cannot currently, and need not, determine,"" he wrote. ""Whatever his reason for doing so, Friedman's bringing MasterCard's counsel into the negotiating process created a conflict between class members and class counsel, and specifically a risk that Friedman, with Ravelo in his ear, negotiated settlement terms that are worse for class members than the terms he might have negotiated absent that conflict.""The judge said Friedman's co-counsel, Reinhardt Wendorf & Blanchfield and Read McCaffrey, showed their own questionable judgment by sticking with Friedman in a brief attempting to rescue the settlement, rather than acknowledging his wrongdoing.""This gives the appearance that Friedman's co-counsel may be more interested in protecting Friedman, their settlement, and their attorneys' fees application, than they are in protecting the merchant class that they purport to represent,"" the judge said. He removed Friedman as class counsel and ordered the other lead lawyers to submit briefs on why he shouldn't bounce them as well.""BURN AFTER READING"" Garaufis' opinion is full of surprising revelations, like Friedman and Ravelo's plan to jointly represent merchants in arbitrations against American Express or to buy a Gulfstream jet and start an air charter business. Friedman, according to the judge, knew full well that it was wrong of him to share documents from the Amex case with Ravelo. He sent some sensitive messages to Ravelo's personal email account, rather than her work addresses, ""suggesting an intention to keep the communications from being discovered,"" Judge Garaufis wrote. And in at least two emails to Ravelo, the judge said, Friedman wrote, ""Burn after reading.""Breaching attorney client privilege might have been enough of an offense to justify a finding that Friedman did not adequately represent the merchants in the class, the judge said, ""but this is not where the misconduct ends, and it does not constitute the complete story of the inadequacy of representation in this case.""""FANTASY RESOLUTION"" That is where Judge Garaufis' opinion gets really interesting. He discusses the intersection of the now-rejected Amex settlement with merchants' $5.7 billion settlement with MasterCard and Visa, suggesting a motive for Friedman to push for a certain provision in the MasterCard deal. Retailers with objections to the MasterCard settlement have struggled to convince the magistrate judge in their case that Friedman's improper disclosures should upend the final judgment entered against MasterCard and Visa.Garaufis' opinion should help them hone their theory. According to the judge, the two settlements were inextricably connected, and Friedman - who assisted class counsel in the MasterCard case in negotiations on injunctive relief - had an incentive to argue for a provision in that settlement that would help him reach a deal with Amex.The judge quoted an email from November 2011 in which Friedman told Ravelo that Amex's ""fantasy resolution"" of the swipe fee litigation was surcharge parity, in which merchants can tack on fees for Amex users as long as they charge the same fees when customers use Visa and MasterCard credit cards. The way to obtain that ""fantasy,"" Friedman said, was to include a provision in the merchants' settlement with Visa and MasterCard to require a ""level playing field"" for such surcharges.INTERDEPENDENCE Friedman was in constant touch with Ravelo during MasterCard's settlement negotiations, according to Garaufis, providing her with the plaintiffs' strategy memos and even volunteering to draft a paragraph on the level playing field provision for Ravelo to present to MasterCard.At the same time, the judge said, he passed to her information about Amex's negotiating position and the class posture in that case.""This interaction between the (MasterCard) settlement and the (Amex) settlement agreement illustrates why Friedman's apparent collaboration with Ravelo is so troubling,"" Judge Garaufis said.""Friedman's ability to be a zealous advocate for the class was compromised by his collaboration with counsel for MasterCard, an entity with interests divergent to those of the class; there is reason to be concerned that he was not acting solely in the class's interests when he, teamed with Ravelo, engaged in settlement negotiations and decision-making.""The judge effectively outlines the interdependence of the two settlements. But the challenge for objectors in the MasterCard case will be to show Friedman or Ravelo had decision-making authority over that settlement. That won't be easy.The class was represented by lead counsel from Robins Kaplan; Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd; and Berger & Montague, with Friedman just in a supporting role. MasterCard's lead counsel was Ken Gallo of Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton & Garrison, not Keila Ravelo.And as settlement proponents in the MasterCard case have said repeatedly, their deal - including the level playing field provision - was proposed by an independent mediator in December 2011. Much of the correspondence between Friedman and Ravelo that Judge Garaufis cites came after the mediator had already suggested the provision.Overturning the MasterCard settlement is still a very long shot, but Judge Garaufis' Amex ruling may improve the odds for settlement detractors. Objectors have submitted briefs calling for judgment in the case to be vacated to Visa, MasterCard and class counsel. Settlement proponents have until Aug. 18 to respond.(Reporting by Alison Frankel)",2015-08-05,MA,"Wed Aug 5, 2015 | 7:32pm EDT",COLUMN-Judge finds lawyer 'fatally tainted' Amex deal: Frankel,http://www.reuters.com//article/otc-amex-idUSL1N10G3YZ20150805?type=companyNews

Cards issued by Visa Inc and MasterCard Inc  will also be subject to the annual cash withdrawal limit, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) said in a statement on its website.The current rule only sets a daily withdrawal limit of 10,000 yuan per card.For the last three months of this year, the maximum amount of cash that can be withdrawn overseas using a single card will be 50,000 yuan, SAFE said. The step was aimed at curbing ""money laundering risks"" after it found some unusual activities among card holders, it said.""Recent monitoring found that some UnionPay card holders have made frequent, large cash withdrawals overseas, foreign financial regulators have also alerted on this,"" the SAFE said. The announcement by SAFE confirmed an earlier Reuters report.Chinese law prohibits individuals from transferring more than $50,000 out of the country per year, but overseas cash withdrawals via bank cards provided a regulatory loophole.The move coincided with recent steps by China to stem capital outflows. Banks have been told to bolster checks on foreign exchange transactions and identify ""abnormal"" cross-border fund transfers.Worries over China's economic slowdown and possible interest rate rises by the U.S. Federal Reserve have led to a wave of capital outflows that intensified after China's surprise yuan devaluation in August.

189,"  * Foreign firms may have to partner with local cos - sources* China Unionpay currently has monopoly on payment card market* Forcing foreign cos into partnerships may breach 2012 WTO ruling* China tipped to be world's biggest payment card market by 2020By Matthew Miller and Michael MartinaBEIJING, Oct 27 China is considering imposing tough new conditions on overseas bank card providers such as Visa Inc and MasterCard Inc, in a potential setback to their plans to enter the country's $7 trillion card payments market, according to people familiar with discussions.Industry sources, lawyers and U.S. business lobbies are worried that Chinese regulators will push foreign card firms to operate through a domestic consortium and may try to force them to partner with local companies and governments, reducing the amount of control they would have over their businesses and limiting their returns.Such measures, if implemented, would be a blow to global card payment firms, which have been lobbying for more than a decade to access the world's fastest-growing cards market, projected to become the biggest by 2020.It may also defy a 2012 World Trade Organization (WTO) ruling that found China was discriminating against U.S. credit card firms by allowing China UnionPay, a state-controlled consortium, a monopoly on all yuan payment cards issued and used in the country.The State Council, the government's cabinet, announced in April that China would open the card market to all properly-licensed domestic and foreign businesses, a move precipitated by the 2012 WTO ruling.But possible new conditions have been raised in discussions between card companies and domestic enterprises and municipal governments in the months since the People's Bank of China (PBOC) issued its draft implementation regulations, sources told Reuters on condition of anonymity.Jeremie Waterman, Greater China executive director at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, told the U.S. Trade Representative this month in testimony that any foreign card provider may be required to join a domestic consortium to get a licence, limiting their operational control. ""We hope the State Council's April decision ... will allow qualified foreign electronic payments firms to set up bank clearing operations in the near future - even as we are receiving reports that Chinese regulators may award new licences only to those foreign companies that partner with domestic companies,"" Waterman said.There have also been discussions about whether to limit the number of licences granted to the foreign card companies, with the possibility that just one or two might be issued, sources said on condition of anonymity.""The concern on the number of licences that will be issued to foreign companies is still there,"" one lawyer familiar with the issue told Reuters.Industry watchers expect the PBOC's implementation regulations to be out imminently.The PBOC declined to comment on the issue and China's Ministry of Commerce did not respond to a request for comment. UNWRITTEN RULES The initial qualifications that were publicly outlined by the State Council earlier this year were already seen as onerous by some legal professionals, including requirements that applicants hold 1 billion yuan ($157 million) in registered capital in a local company, and store data and infrastructure inside mainland China.Even if the new conditions are not included in the text of the forthcoming PBOC regulations, there are concerns they could be imposed as unwritten rules.""If you look at other sectors, they are making those kinds of demands in high-tech, automobiles, and commercial airliners. So, that general pressure for foreign companies to partner with state-owned companies is growing,"" said Scott Kennedy, Director of the Project on Chinese Business and Political Economy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.Kennedy said that while lawyers would debate whether such requirements comply with China's WTO mandate, they would be inconsistent with the spirit of the 2012 ruling and Beijing's original commitment to open access to financial markets. ""I think people would read it for what it is - wanting to make sure that whatever access is given to foreign companies, the benefits still accrue to domestic companies,"" Kennedy said.A spokeswoman for Visa declined to comment.MasterCard told Reuters it ""has established strong industry partnerships"" in China and that open payment systems would promote growth and reduce systemic risk.""We will continue to monitor closely and look forward to the day when we can compete for domestic business in China,"" the company said in a statement.MasterCard and UnionPay signed an agreement in 2010 to issue co-branded cards that Chinese people could use when travelling overseas.Critics have argued China's limitations on foreign card players sought to protect the country's then nascent domestic industry from competition, allowing UnionPay unfettered access at a time of explosive growth in the interbank card market.Currently, China requires all foreign card companies to use UnionPay's network when accepting yuan payments, effectively giving it a cut of every credit or debit card transaction.Foreign card issuers in most other countries pay only the bank involved in the transaction because they can use their own networks.At the same time, UnionPay has been expanding rapidly outside China as it battles MasterCard and Visa for global market share.UnionPay is now the world's largest card brand with more than 5 billion cards issued internationally since its founding in 2002.

In volume terms, April sales dropped 7.6 percent, government data showed on Tuesday. ""Many types of retail outlet still recorded notable falls in sales, reflecting the continued drag from the slowdown in inbound tourism as well as the more cautious local consumer sentiment amid subpar economic conditions,"" the government said in a statement.Hong Kong is struggling with mounting economic challenges from the prospect of rising U.S. interest rates, which has stepped up capital outflows, and from China's economic slowdown.Mainland tourists are avoiding the city amid political tensions with China and growing calls from radical activists for greater autonomy from Beijing. ""The near-term outlook for retail sales will continue to depend on the performance of inbound tourism,"" the government added.Hong Kong tourist arrivals in April fell 2.1 percent from a year earlier to 4.69 million, after sliding 4.3 percent in March. Mainland visitors, which accounted for 73.8 percent of the total, fell 4 percent to 3.46 million in April. (bit.ly/1WupAMF)April sales of jewellery, watches, clocks and valuable gifts fell 16.6 percent in value terms, a 20th consecutive month of decline. Department store sales slid 6.8 percent on year, while wearing apparel fell 5.9 percent. MasterCard's MasterCard Advisors said its retail sales in Hong Kong in April contracted 5.7 percent from a year earlier amid declining Chinese tourism and subdued local spending.A string of retailers from jewellery firms to cosmetics retailers have warned of weaker sales amid a decline in mainland tourists and weak consumer sentiment.Chow Tai Fook Jewellery and cosmetic chain Sa Sa International had warned that their annual profit for the year ended in March could be half what it reported last year.General merchandise stores operator AEON Stores  said they would swing into the red for the six months ending in June, while apparel chain Bauhaus expected its net profit for the year ended in March to fall 70 percent.($1 = 7.7674 Hong Kong dollars)   (Reporting by Donny Kwok; Editing by Jacqueline Wong)",2016-05-31,MA,"Tue May 31, 2016 | 6:06am EDT",UPDATE 1-Hong Kong April retail sales fall for 14th straight month,http://www.reuters.com//article/hongkong-economy-retail-idUSL4N18R2Z9?type=companyNews

223,"  (The opinions expressed here are those of Alison Frankel, a columnist for Reuters.)By Alison FrankelNEW YORK June 30 The biggest money-damages antitrust settlement in U.S. history died Thursday at the 2nd U.S. Court of Appeals.Not because of last year's scandal surrounding leaks to a onetime MasterCard lawyer since charged with fraud, but because the agreement between credit card giants MasterCard, Visa and the merchants suing them for inflating certain fees was fundamentally unfair to some of the retailers.A three-judge appellate panel at the New York-based federal appeals court reversed U.S. District Judge John Gleeson's 2012 approval of the $7.25 billion settlement, holding that the agreement failed to resolve basic conflicts between merchants entitled to money damages and a separate class forced to release future claims in exchange for revisions to some of the rules governing credit card fees.Lawyers representing the class were awarded $544.8 million based on the money damages they obtained, not based on the rule changes the credit card companies agree to.That dynamic, according to the 2nd Circuit, ""sapped class counsel of the incentive to zealously represent"" merchants in the injunction-only class, who could not opt out of the settlement. Named plaintiffs and class counsel, the appellate court said, could not adequately represent the interests of the two different groups of merchants.""Class representatives had interests antagonistic to those of some of the class members they were representing,"" wrote Judge Dennis Jacobs for a panel that also included Judges Pierre Leval and Ralph Winter.""The fault lines were glaring as to matters of fundamental importance. Such conflicts and absence of incentive required a sufficient 'structural assurance of fair and adequate representation,' but none was provided,"" the opinion said, quoting from the U.S. Supreme Court's landmark 1997 class action opinion, Amchem v. Windsor.I should point out that the appellate court specifically said it did not intend to ""impugn the motives or acts of class counsel,"" including lawyers from Robins Kaplan, Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd and Berger & Montague. ""Nonetheless, class counsel was charged with an inequitable task,"" Judge Jacobs wrote. The 2nd Circuit said the Supreme Court's rulings in Amchem and its 1999 successor, Ortiz v. Fibreboard, compel appellate courts to look skeptically at class action settlements that release defendants from claims by absent plaintiffs. In this case, the court said, the terms of the injunction proved that merchants -- including those that haven't even yet set up shop -- were not adequately represented.The rule changes MasterCard and Visa agreed to make would offer no relief at all to large swaths of the class, such as merchants that also accept American Express and those in states that do not allow fee surcharges.Yet the settlement precluded all merchants that accept MasterCard and Visa from ever suing the companies over rules not specifically addressed in the deal.""EXCEPTIONALLY BROAD""  The appellate opinion called the release ""exceptionally broad."" In a concurring opinion, Judge Leval added, ""This is not a settlement; it is a confiscation.""He continued: ""No merchants operating from November 28, 2012, until the end of time will ever be allowed to sue the defendants, either for damages or for an injunction, complaining of any conduct (other than that enjoined) that could have been alleged in the present suit,"" he wrote.""One class of plaintiffs receives money as compensation for the defendants' arguable past violations, and in return gives up the future rights of others. The Supreme Court has addressed such circumstances and ruled that an adjudication coming to this result is impermissible.""Precedent in the 2nd Circuit, according to the opinion, discourages approval of class action settlements in which a single set of lawyers attempts to represent two different classes with conflicting interests.Judge Jacobs peppered the decision with references to the 2nd Circuit's 2011 decision in In re Literary Works, which involved a class action copyright dispute between authors and online publishers. In that case, as in the Visa/MasterCard ruling, the appeals court said the deal did not adequately represent the interests of all class members. (Thursday's opinion distinguished the facts in those two cases from those in 2013's Charron v. Wiener, in which the 2nd Circuit upheld approval of multiclass settlement negotiated by a single set of lawyers - but only after the two classes were separately certified.)Interestingly, the 2nd Circuit emphasized that trial judges cannot paper over basic conflicts among class members by involving themselves or court-appointed mediators in the negotiating process. Judge Gleeson, who has since left the bench in Brooklyn federal court, helped shape the Visa/MasterCard settlement, as did U.S. Magistrate Judge James Orenstein and other mediators.The 2nd Circuit said their involvement didn't solve the fundamental problem: ""One aspect of the settlement agreement that emphatically cannot remedy the inadequate representation is the assistance of judges and mediators in the bargaining process.""COMPETING INTERESTS My colleague Jon Stempel has reactions from several of the interested parties in his Reuters piece about the 2nd Circuit's rejection of the settlement, although Paul Clement of Bancroft -- who argued at the 2nd Circuit for class counsel -- didn't get back to him. (Thomas Goldstein of Goldstein & Russell argued for the merchants who objected to the settlement.)For lawyers, the important message from the ruling is that no matter how hard you work -- and no one doubts the incredible effort of the lawyers and judges who slogged through a decade on this litigation, including years of settlement negotiation -- the 2nd Circuit is not going to look favorably at class action settlements in which one set of lawyers represents class members with competing interests.Adding more lawyers (and class representatives) complicates settlement talks, especially in an already vast case like this one. But you have to be able to show the 2nd Circuit that everyone's interests were protected.It's a lot easier to take care of that before you reach a settlement than to return to negotiations after your proposed deal is struck down.

224,"   By Jonathan Stempel | NEW YORK  NEW YORK A federal appeals court on Thursday threw out a $7.25 billion antitrust settlement reached by Visa Inc (V.N) and MasterCard Inc (MA.N) with millions of retailers that accused the card networks of improperly fixing credit and debit card fees.The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York said the accord was unfair to retailers that stood to receive no payments and, in the court's view, little or no benefit at all. It also decertified the case as a class action.""This is not a settlement; it is a confiscation,"" wrote Circuit Judge Pierre Leval, a member of the three-judge panel that unanimously struck down the settlement.The deal had been the largest all-cash U.S. antitrust settlement, though its value shrank to about $5.7 billion after roughly 8,000 retailers ""opted out.""Thursday's decision is a blow to the credit card industry, which hoped the settlement would end a decade of litigation brought on behalf of about 12 million retailers against Visa, MasterCard and banks that issue their cards.It was intended to resolve claims that merchants were overcharged on interchange fees, or swipe fees, when shoppers used credit or debit cards, and were barred from directing customers toward cheaper means of payment.The settlement may now need to be renegotiated, or the case could go to trial.""Swipe fees are an improper and unnecessary hidden tax on consumers,"" said Jeffrey Shinder, a Constantine Cannon partner representing Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O), Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) and other opponents of the accord. ""The structure of swipe fees is back on the table.""Visa spokeswoman Connie Kim said the Foster City, California-based company is reviewing the decision.MasterCard spokesman Seth Eisen said the company, based in Purchase, New York, is disappointed in the decision and will review its next steps. Visa shares closed down $2.57, or 3.3 percent, at $74.17. MasterCard fell $4.07, or 4.4 percent, to $88.06. The S&P 500 Information Technology Index .SPLRCT, which includes both, rose 1.1 percent.RETHINKING BEHAVIOR U.S. District Judge John Gleeson in Brooklyn had approved the settlement in December 2013, saying it offered ""significant"" damages and meaningful protections against future harm.Many retailers and trade groups nevertheless objected. Some said the payout should have been higher. Others said the accord would have made it too hard to sue Visa and MasterCard. Wal-Mart, in a statement, said the settlement would also have ""stifled innovation around new payments technologies and left consumers facing continually increasing hidden swipe fees.""Card issuers American Express Co (AXP.N) and Discover Financial Services (DFS.N) also objected to the settlement.The National Retail Federation said retailers pay roughly $60 billion annually in swipe fees, which typically average around 2 percent.Mallory Duncan, the group's general counsel, told Reuters in an interview that the settlement would have ""forever"" shielded card networks from a variety of litigation, while giving retailers ""at best"" three cents on the dollar in damages.Thursday's decision ""will give real incentives to the card networks to rethink their anti-competitive behavior,"" he said. Paul Clement, who led the appeal for retailers supporting the accord, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Card-issuing banks would have funded much of the settlement. JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) and Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) had estimated they were responsible for roughly one-fifth and one-tenth, respectively, of a payout. Both declined to comment.The settlement had called for retailers that accepted Visa or MasterCard from January 2004 to November 2012 to share in as much as $7.25 billion, with the ability to opt out.Retailers that accepted the cards from then on, meanwhile, were to get injunctive relief in the form of rule changes, expiring in July 2021, and could not opt out.Writing for the appeals court, Circuit Judge Dennis Jacobs said these groups' divergent interests meant they should not have been represented by the same law firms, which were awarded $544.8 million of fees.While making clear he did not question the firms' motives, Jacobs said the conflict ""sapped"" their incentive to zealously represent the retailers obtaining injunctive relief, and led to terms that benefited other retailers at their expense.The case will return to the Brooklyn federal court, where it will be overseen by U.S. District Judge Margo Brodie.The case is In Re: Payment Card Interchange Fee and MerchantDiscount Antitrust Litigation, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 12-4671.

237,"   By Matthew Miller | BEIJING  BEIJING MasterCard Inc (MA.N) hopes to apply this year to become a payment service provider in China after the government opened the market, but the company is still weighing whether to do so alone or with a partner, senior executives said on Friday.The world's most populous country is ""pretty crucial"" to its future, but MasterCard is still studying rules in China that would affect its business and is hammering out a business plan, Ann Cairns, president of international markets, told Reuters in an interview.China in June allowed foreign payment card companies to operate in the country under new rules, potentially giving companies like MasterCard and Visa Inc (V.N) access to its 55 trillion yuan ($8.25 trillion) card payment market. Under the rules, China's national security and cyber security standards must be met. Applicants must also hold 1 billion yuan in registered capital in a local company.""We're trying to understand the rules,"" Cairns said, adding that MasterCard would like to enter China as soon as possible. ""Certain things inside the rules – such as the new cyber rules, which need more development and understanding about how they’re going to work."" Visa and MasterCard, the world's two largest credit and debit card companies, have been lobbying for more than a decade for direct access to China's cards market, projected to become the world's biggest by 2020.Asked if it was possible that MasterCard submits a license application this calendar year, Ling Hai, co-president for Asia-Pacific, said that was the hope but there were no guarantees.""There is so much uncertainty and variability in the process. Something that should take one year can take two years,"" he said. Bank card consumer transactions reached 55 trillion yuan in 2015, accounting for 48 percent of total social consumption, according to the People's Bank of China. The market is dominated by state-run China UnionPay Co.Asked what was holding MasterCard back from jumping in, Cairns said it hinged on the business model and which local partners it decides to go with. Cairns said capital requirements, security standards and for MasterCard to be locally based did not represent obstacles to the company.MasterCard has never said it was under pressure to partner in China, according to Cairns.

""Mastercard has behaved disgracefully in this. They have not had the reasonableness to accept that what this was doing was damaging UK consumers.""  Mastercard said in a statement it denied any wrongdoing.""We continue to firmly disagree with the basis of this claim and we intend to oppose it vigorously,"" the world's second-largest payments network said. The lawsuit comes after the European Union's antitrust regulator found in 2014 Mastercard's fees to store owners to process international payments within the EU were excessive.Law firm Quinn Emanuel said the lawsuit was the largest damages claim in British history and would be brought under a law meaning consumers would automatically be claimants unless they opt out. Any person living in Britain who used a credit card, cash or checks and was over 16 years old in the period covered by the lawsuit will automatically be part of the claim.If the 14 billion pound claim was shared equally between the number of eligible claimants, each person could receive more than 300 pounds each, according to a Reuters' calculation.A lawyer working on the case said Mastercard charged shops fees in excess of 1 percent for card use on international transactions between 1992 and 2008.Although the EU's anti-trust regulator only ruled Mastercard's international fees were illegal, this impacted British consumers as it was the default fee used in Britain. Two years ago, the European Union capped the fees retailers pay at 0.2 percent for debit cards and 0.3 percent for credit cards.     Merricks in a statement said the case is a watershed moment for consumer compensation in Britain.Merricks was head of Britain's financial services ombudsmen for ten years until 2009, helping to settle disputes between consumers and financial services companies.  Britain's banks have been caught in a range of mis-selling cases in the last five years. They have paid 24 billion pounds in compensation for mis-selling loan payment insurance, making it Britain's costliest scandal in financial services.Consumers no longer living in Britain, but who lived in the country between 1992 and 2008, can opt in to the collective claim against Mastercard.Any hearing on the case is not expected until early 2018, unless MasterCard settle it out of court.

Any person living in Britain who used a credit card, cash or checks and was over 16 years old in the period covered by the lawsuit will automatically be part of the claim.If the 14 billion pound claim was shared equally between the number of eligible claimants, each person could receive more than 300 pounds each, according to a Reuters' calculation.A lawyer working on the case said Mastercard charged shops fees in excess of 1 percent for card use on international transactions between 1992 and 2008.Although the EU's anti-trust regulator only ruled Mastercard's international fees were illegal, this impacted British consumers as it was the default fee used in Britain. Two years ago, the European Union capped the fees retailers pay at 0.2 percent for debit cards and 0.3 percent for credit cards.     Merricks in a statement said the case is a watershed moment for consumer compensation in Britain.Merricks was head of Britain's financial services ombudsmen for ten years until 2009, helping to settle disputes between consumers and financial services companies.  Britain's banks have been caught in a range of mis-selling cases in the last five years. They have paid 24 billion pounds in compensation for mis-selling loan payment insurance, making it Britain's costliest scandal in financial services.Consumers no longer living in Britain, but who lived in the country between 1992 and 2008, can opt in to the collective claim against Mastercard.Any hearing on the case is not expected until early 2018, unless MasterCard settle it out of court.

263,"   By Devidutta Tripathy and Sankalp Phartiyal | MUMBAI  MUMBAI India's abolition of 500- and 1,000-rupee notes with virtually no warning caused confusion and concern among ordinary people and in sectors of the economy where cash is king, but banks and electronic payment services are among those licking their lips.Among the biggest losers from the shock move, aimed at flushing out money hidden from the tax man in India's huge shadow economy, is expected to be property, and the sharp drop in the sector's stocks on India's two main exchanges on Wednesday reflected that.It was better news for financial services companies involved in moving money around the formal economy, however, and among them was PayTM, India's top mobile payment wallet services provider.It said it saw a 200 percent jump in app downloads and a 1,000 percent increase in the amount of money added to its wallets since Prime Minister Narendra Modi's announcement of the curbs late on Tuesday.MobiKwik, which also offers mobile wallet services, said it saw a more than 40 percent increase in app downloads.""We'll be a country with a lot more digital transactions and payments now,"" said Vijay Shekhar Sharma, chief executive of PayTM, whose biggest shareholder is Alibaba Group (BABA.N).India's shadow, or ""black"", economy is estimated to be the size of about a fifth of its gross domestic product, with millions still having no access to formal financial services.Most financial transactions still happen in cash, although alternative payments and the use of cards have risen fast in recent years.Kotak Securities said it expected a large part of the shadow economy to become part of the formal economy, including the banking system, over time.Banks will benefit from higher savings deposits, while more financial savings also bodes well for insurance, mutual funds and wealth management companies, analysts said. Shares in top lender State Bank of India (SBI.NS) rose 2.9 percent on Wednesday on a Mumbai market .NSEI that closed 1.3 percent lower. The banking sector index  edged up 0.1 percent.Global card network providers Visa and MasterCard welcomed the Indian decision, saying it would help cashless transactions. PayPal Holdings Inc called it a ""master stroke"" to make India a less cash-reliant economy.PAIN FOR PROPERTY, GOLD, FOOD The crackdown on unaccounted wealth will put further pressure on the real estate sector, considered a safe haven for ""black"" money and already battling slower home sales. The impact will likely be felt by smaller developers and in the secondary sales market, making the real estate sector more illiquid for some time, said Anshul Jain, managing director for India at consultant Cushman & Wakefield. ""Working capital needs for small and medium developers and other businesses will be a lot higher,"" said Jain, adding that prices will correct in markets where substantial speculative investments have been made using unregistered cash.DLF Ltd (DLF.NS), India's biggest listed property developer, slumped more than 17 percent in Mumbai trading on Wednesday, while the sector index .NIFTYREAL fell 11.6 percent.A DLF spokesman, however, said the bank note move would not make ""any big difference"" for larger real estate companies who carried out transactions through banking channels. ""It is only a popular perception that real estate spawns black money, which is actually not true."" The crackdown is also seen as negative for jewelers, as it could lower the demand for gold despite a short-term rush for the precious metal late on Tuesday, analysts said.""Significant amounts of demand for gold used to get generated (by) unaccounted wealth,"" said Surendra Mehta, Secretary at India Bullion and Jewelers Association.""Since such unaccounted money is set to lose value after the scrapping of 500 rupee and 1,000 rupee notes, demand for gold will also drop.""Mehta estimated India's gold demand would fall by 100-150 tonnes next year from an annual average of about 800 tonnes.The central bank will launch a new series of 500 and 2,000 rupee notes later this week.Other sectors that could be impacted in the short term due to shifts in demand include consumer goods and automobiles, Edelweiss Securities said.Cement makers such as ACC (ACC.NS) and UltraTech (ULTC.NS) will be hit, as 70 percent of demand comes from housing, HDFC Securities analysts said, adding that they expected cement companies to cut production.Food chain operators such as those run by Jubilant FoodWorks (JUBI.NS), which operates the Domino's Pizza and Dunkin' Donuts chains in India, will also be temporarily affected as students mostly buy in cash, the brokerage added.

267,"   By Alison Frankel  I doubt that when history books survey the shocking events of November 2016, they will spare many words for the U.S. Supreme Court’s announcement late Thursday that it had dismissed a pair of cases involving credit card networks and ATM fees ranks. But for lawyers in the elite ranks of the Supreme Court bar, the justices’ order – which said that Visa, MasterCard and bank members of credit card networks had changed their argument after persuading the court to take their case -- created a considerable stir in the elite appellate bar, not least because counsel of record for Visa and the other petitioners is Neal Katyal of Hogan Lovells, a former acting U.S. solicitor general and extremely accomplished Supreme Court litigator.So what happened?I should say right here that I don’t know for sure. Katyal didn’t respond to my email requesting comment and the lawyers I spoke with didn’t want to go on the record, for the most part. But those conversations and filings in the Supreme Court cases – there were two parallel proceedings with different respondents – suggest that the credit card companies briefed their petitions for Supreme Court review on quite narrow grounds that, even if they prevailed, wouldn’t be especially useful to them in the future. Once they reached the Supreme Court, though, they asserted a bolder argument that, had they won it, would have given their industry broad antitrust protection.Strategically, in other words, the credit card companies may have been willing to risk the rare indignity of having their cases tossed for the chance of winning a decision worth potentially billions of dollars. The justices don’t seem to have appreciated that gamesmanship.The underlying litigation alleged that Visa and MasterCard - which at the time operated as associations of member banks - and their member banks violated the Sherman Act by jacking up the fees for independent ATMs to access their networks. A trial judge in Washington, D.C., dismissed the cases, finding, among other things, that the plaintiffs hadn’t shown restraint of trade. The District of Columbia U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals revived the suits in 2015. An array of distinguished firms represented Visa, MasterCard and the banks in their petition for certiorari: Arnold & Porter; Skadden Arps Slate Meagher & Flom, Morrison & Foerster, Patterson Belknap Webb & Tyler and Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton & Garrison. Their argument was that the D.C. Circuit split with the 9th Circuit in a nearly identical case (and more broadly with other federal circuits) when it held that mere membership in and adherence to the rules of the Visa and MasterCard networks was sufficient to allege members engaged in an antitrust conspiracy. The cert petitions defined the question presented as: “Whether allegations that members of a business association agreed to adhere to the association's rules and possess governance rights in the association, without more, are sufficient to plead the element of conspiracy in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act.”Despite opposition from the consumers and from the independent ATM operators that had brought the underlying suits – which argued that the D.C. Circuit didn’t look only at membership in the Visa and MasterCard associations but at additional evidence of collusion as well – the justices agreed to take the cases to hear the question the credit card companies presented. Between the cert grant on June 28 and the opening merits brief, Visa, MasterCard and the banks changed their counsel of record, bringing in Katyal of Hogan Lovells. The credit card companies and banks also changed their argument, though they didn’t say so. Instead of asserting that membership in a business association is not sufficient evidence of members participating in antitrust conspiracy, Katyal made the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2010 decision in American Needle v. National Football League the centerpiece of his merits brief. American Needle, you’ll recall, involved an antitrust challenge to NFL teams for granting apparel licenses as a group.Though the NFL lost, the credit card companies’ merits brief asserted that the Supreme Court considered the teams a single entity – a sort of joint marketing venture. Each credit card company and its network of banks, the merits brief said, should be viewed not as horizontal competitors engaged in a conspiracy to fix ATM access fees but as a single network. “The D.C. Circuit thought respondents' circumstantial allegations regarding the banks' role in each network's governance were enough” to let the case proceed, the brief said, citing American Needle. “But every joint venture involves cooperation between legally distinct entities, often with respect to how the venture will be run. And nothing in the complaints suggests the rules were the product of each network's member banks' ‘act[ing] on interests separate from those of' their network.”Now it’s important to remember that Visa and MasterCard are no longer membership associations – the subject of the question presented in the cert petition. But both still operate in networks with the banks that offer their cards. And both face big-dollar claims that they and their bank members collude on fees. If the Supreme Court were to agree with the Visa and MasterCard reframing of their networks’ activities in the ATM fee case, wrote Thomas Goldstein of Goldstein & Russell in a response brief for the independent ATM operators, “it is hard to see how competitors could ever be subject to suit under Section 1 for the activities of a joint venture.” Goldstein’s brief pointed out that Visa and the other petitioners had not even mentioned American Needle or joint ventures when they asked the Supreme Court for review. Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, which represents the consumer respondents, said the same it its brief. So did the Justice Department in its filing in support of the respondents. All of the briefs urged the justices not to allow Visa and MasterCard to game the Supreme Court.“Departing from this court's settled practice of deciding only the Question Presented would be particularly improvident in this case,” Goldstein wrote. “The issue petitioners belatedly raise is central to an array of Section 1 claims against petitioners in other suits that have not yet been decided in the lower courts. Those cases involve a wide variety of restraints that have not even been described to this court, much less briefed in a manner that could permit a reasoned decision on such important matters. … Indeed, petitioners' goal in pivoting their argument in this court so radically is almost certainly to secure such sweeping antitrust immunity, short-circuiting the other suits they now face.”The justices gave Visa, MasterCard and their counsel a chance to respond, but in briefs filed earlier this week, Katyal mostly reargued the credit card companies’ position on antitrust and joint ventures, though he did point out that the consumer opposition to certiorari raised American Needle. The credit card companies’ joint venture assertions, the response brief said, fall squarely within the question that was presented in the cert petition.Obviously, the justices disagreed, since they dismissed the cases the day after the response briefs were filed. The Supreme Court apparently had an open mind about whether to allow the credit card companies to expand their argument as recently as Nov. 14, when it granted the solicitor general’s office permission to participate in the scheduled Dec. 7 oral argument. It seems that the response briefs must have resolved any doubts, to the detriment of the credit card companies.",2016-11-19,MA,"Fri Nov 18, 2016 | 8:34pm EST","SCOTUS dismissal of ATM fees case: Visa, MasterCard swung for a home run, called out on strikes",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-otc-visa-idUSKBN13E03X?type=companyNews
268,"   By Jemima Kelly | CANNES, France  CANNES, France British shoppers will soon be able to decide to spread the cost of a purchase over a series of monthly installments at the point of making a payment with their credit card, in a new partnership between Mastercard Inc card machine maker Verifone Systems Inc.The ""Mastercard Instalments"" app - the first of its kind in Britain - will launch on Verifone payment terminals at some UK retailers in January, and will then be rolled out to other shops across the country. Customers who have been deemed eligible by their banks will be given the option of paying for their purchases in fixed installments at the point that they insert their card into a payment terminal. They will also be advised of the interest rate they will be charged, in line with the terms of the loan.""For the merchant it's an interesting value proposition because we're saying: we're going to give your customers a new way of financing their purchase that's private - they don't need to talk to anybody or do any credit checks,"" Verifone commerce enablement and innovation vice president Nathan Gill told Reuters at the sidelines of the Trustech conference in Cannes.  ""It’s very simple: they put in their Mastercard, they’re given an offer in real-time, and they can decide whether to accept it or not,"" he added, saying he expected the app would lead to more purchases being made, of a higher value. The app will be launched on what Verifone calls its ""Commerce Platform"", which sits inside its payment terminals and allows fintech firms such as China's Alipay and other developers to build payment apps.     ""Just like in the mobile space, when applications started helping you with every element of your life, when it comes to payments, you’re now going to have apps that assist you with those,"" said Gill. ""The functionality that you'll now have on payment terminals is now going to increase exponentially.""Mastercard Instalments has already launched in Romania in a partnership between Mastercard and Romanian bank BRD–Groupe Société Générale. But this is the first time Verifone has offered a financing service. ""Verifone’s payment devices are used all over the country, so this is a big step forward,"" said Mastercard UK & Ireland President Mark Barnett.
