0,"  (deletes paragraph 10, which said SHPS was acquired by ADP. ADP acquired a portion of SHPS.)By Sharon BegleyNEW YORK Jan 6 A long-running and well-respected workplace wellness program at PepsiCo  that encourages employees to adopt healthier habits has not reduced healthcare costs, according to the most comprehensive evaluation of a such a program ever published.Released on Monday in the journal Health Affairs and based on data for thousands of PepsiCo employees over seven years, the findings ""cast doubt on the widely held belief"" that workplace wellness programs save employers significantly more than they cost, conclude Soeren Mattke of the RAND Corporation and his co-authors. ""Blanket claims of 'wellness saves money' are not warranted.""Workplace wellness programs, a $6 billion-a-year industry, are a favorite of the business community because they promise to improve productivity, cut absenteeism and reduce medical costs by averting expensive illnesses. They aim, for instance, to help employees quit smoking, maintain a healthy weight and have regular screenings for elevated cholesterol, high blood pressure, cancer and other conditions, all of which are supposed to reduce healthcare spending.Half of U.S. employers with at least 50 workers offered a wellness program in 2012, as did more than 90 percent of those with 50,000-plus workers, according to a 2013 RAND report. PepsiCo's was introduced in 2003.The programs are also a pillar of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), President Barack Obama's healthcare reform law. The ACA allows employers to reward workers who participate in wellness programs, and penalize those who refuse, with discounts or increases of as much as 30 percent of their insurance costs. That can be thousands of dollars per year.Some workers have objected to the programs because of the penalties. Others say workplace wellness efforts invade their privacy and promote poor medicine.Last year, for instance, faculty members at Pennsylvania State University rebelled against a workplace wellness program whose ""health risk assessment"" asked, among other questions, whether male employees examined their testicles every month and whether women employees intended to become pregnant. They also protested its requirement that even healthy young adults receive frequent cholesterol and other screenings, which physicians recommend against, and the steep penalties for opting out: $1,200 a year. ""You're making employees do something that invades their privacy and that goes against medical advice, and now we're seeing (in the PepsiCo study) that it doesn't even save the employer money,"" said Al Lewis, founder and president of the Disease Management Purchasing Consortium International, which helps self-insured employers and state programs reduce healthcare costs.Megan Broderick, senior manager of the company's health and welfare benefits and a co-author of the Health Affairs paper, said she could not speak to a reporter without permission.Maria Ghazal, a vice president of the Business Roundtable, an association of chief executives of large U.S. corporations, said its members are ""as enthusiastic as they have ever been about these (workplace wellness) programs,"" adopting them not only to control healthcare costs but also to boost employee morale and improve recruitment.""Wellness is an area where you can distinguish yourself,"" she said. ""Employers feel they help attract and retain"" valued workers. 'HEALTHY LIVING' For their study, RAND's Mattke and his colleagues - including two PepsiCo executives - examined PepsiCo's ""Healthy Living"" program, which has two components.One, called disease management, helps people with any of 10 chronic illnesses, among them asthma, diabetes and hypertension. They receive regular phone conversations with a nurse about managing the condition. Disease management produced healthcare savings of $136 per member per month, largely because of a 29 percent reduction in hospital admissions, the researchers found. When hypertension is well controlled, for instance, people are less likely to land in the hospital with a stroke. When asthmatics take their medication, they don't wind up in the ER unable to breathe.PepsiCo's disease management program ""provides a substantial return for the investment made,"" Mattke said.The ""lifestyle management component"" is what most people think of as a workplace wellness program. It includes a health risk assessment in which workers answer questions about such behavior as eating and exercise habits; smoking cessation programs; and educational materials and telephone sessions with a ""wellness coach"" to help them lose weight, eat healthy, get fit, manage stress or stop smoking.PepsiCo employees who participated in these lifestyle programs reported a small reduction in absenteeism, but there was no significant effect on healthcare costs. (The study uses costs as a proxy for health, assuming that if people get sick they seek care. But it did not explicitly assess the programs' effect on participants' health.)""Participation in lifestyle management interventions,"" conclude the PepsiCo researchers, ""... has no statistically significant effect on healthcare costs,"" and employers considering adopting such a program ""should proceed with caution.""The PepsiCo study is not the first to find that workplace wellness programs fall short of their promise. Last year, Mattke was the lead author of a RAND report that found that healthcare costs of workers who participated in such a program averaged $2.38 less per month than non-participants in the first year of the program and $3.46 less in the fifth year. Neither difference was statistically significant.Researchers who are skeptical of wellness programs' benefits are concerned that the ACA - ""Obamacare"" - allows employers to offer substantial financial rewards and penalties tied to something ineffective.""The ACA took a bad idea, workplace wellness programs, and turbocharged it by allowing employers to penalize workers,"" said Lewis, co-author of a new e-book titled ""Surviving Workplace Wellness.""

1,"  * Dollar index rises to highest in seven weeks after upbeat ADP data* Fed minutes cautious on QE3 taper, but yields rise anyway* Euro under pressure ahead of ECB policy meeting* China inflation data eyed in AsiaBy Ian ChuaSYDNEY, Jan 9 The dollar hovered at seven-week highs against a basket of major currencies early on Thursday, having risen for a second session after an upbeat private-sector jobs report drove U.S. short-term yields and market rates higher.The dollar index rose as far as 81.166, a high not seen since late November, after a report showed private employers added a bigger-than-expected 238,000 jobs in December, the strongest increase in 13 months. The data lifted hopes that non-farm payrolls on Friday will surprise on the upside and pushed 2-year Treasury yields to a four-month high of 43 basis points.Fed fund futures sold off with big losses seen in the late-2015 through to 2018 contracts, such that a first hike in rates is now fully priced for July 2015. Just last month it was not priced in until early 2016.Yet, minutes from the Federal Reserve's Dec. 17-18 meeting showed the central bank wanted to err on the side of caution even as it began to scale back its massive bond-buying stimulus. Traders said recent data suggested the world's biggest economy is well on a recovery path that should allow the Fed to continue to withdraw extraordinary support over 2014, a view that seems to be gaining traction in markets.""Our economist thinks the FOMC is on track to continue tapering in measured steps, on course for ending asset purchases by the end of this year. Against this backdrop, we remain constructive on the U.S. dollar,"" analysts at BNP Paribas wrote in a note to clients.The dollar rose to a one-week high of 105.135 yen  before steadying at 104.82, while the euro slid to a one-month low of $1.3554. The common currency is likely to stay under pressure in the lead up to the European Central Bank policy meeting on Thursday and could fall further if the ECB highlighted the risk of disinflation, traders said.The euro fell to a one-year low on sterling, reaching 82.38 pence, and also retreated against the yen to 142.42  from Wednesday's high of 143.19.The Australian dollar lost ground against the broadly firmer greenback, dipping back below 89 U.S. cents as it continued to relinquish last week's gains.The Aussie's fortunes will depend on local and Chinese data due later in the day. Any upside surprises in domestic retail sales should provide some support.As for China's inflation data, the market expects consumer inflation to have eased to a four-month low of 2.7 percent in December.Such an outcome should be welcomed by markets as it will provide Beijing with room to keep macro policies stable in order to push on with structural reforms.",2014-01-08,ADP,"Wed Jan 8, 2014 | 6:42pm EST",FOREX-Dollar hits seven-week highs; ECB and China data eyed,http://www.reuters.com//article/markets-forex-idUSL3N0KI4NO20140108?type=companyNews
2,"  * Strong ADP report raises hopes for payrolls* Minutes show Fed wanted cautious tapering approach* Micron Tech helps lift Nasdaq after earnings* Dow off 0.4 pct, S&P off 0.02 pct, Nasdaq up 0.3 pctBy Chuck MikolajczakNEW YORK, Jan 8 The S&P 500 finished nearly flat on Wednesday as equity indexes had a muted reaction to the minutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve's most recent meeting, while Micron's strong results helped buoy the Nasdaq.Minutes of the Fed's Dec. 17-18 meeting, after which the U.S. central bank announced its decision to begin trimming its monthly bond purchases, showed Fed officials were careful to tread lightly as they embarked on the tapering process.The Fed's accommodative policies were the main driver of the S&P 500's rally of nearly 30 percent in 2013. The program is expected to keep a floor under stock prices for as long as it continues. ""The financial markets really didn't move at all, but typically history would suggest they need a little bit of time to just digest these things,"" said Darrell Cronk, regional chief investment officer of Wells Fargo Private Bank in New York.""What we need to recognize is since December 18, we've seen a significant improvement in the economic data. If we get a 200,000 or north jobs report on Friday, it increases the likelihood, along with that improving data, the Fed continues its tapering process at the January meeting.""Earlier in the session, a report by ADP, a payrolls processor, showed U.S. private-sector employers added 238,000 jobs in December, more than expected and the best read since November 2012, while November 2013 numbers were revised higher.The Dow Jones industrial average fell 68.20 points or 0.41 percent, to end at 16,462.74. The S&P 500 dipped just 0.39 of a point, or 0.02 percent, to finish at 1,837.49. The Nasdaq Composite rose 12.43 points or 0.30 percent, to close at 4,165.611. The S&P 500 has fallen 0.6 percent over the first five sessions of the year. According to the January effect watched by some market participants, the first month dictates the stock market's fortunes for the year - and the first five trading days are important in determining the outcome.However, Credit Suisse data shows that any month, except October, could be used to determine the market's momentum 11 months ahead more than 50 percent of the time.Micron Technology shares soared 9.9 percent to close at $23.87 and helped bolster the Nasdaq a day after the chipmaker reported higher-than-expected quarterly profits.Microsoft shares slid 1.8 percent to $35.76, pressuring the Dow. Microsoft is closer to naming a new chief executive officer, according to a source familiar with the board's thinking, but it lost a front-runner candidate on Tuesday when Ford's CEO Alan Mulally said he would not be going to the software giant. Ford's stock rose 1 percent to end at $15.54.Shares of JC Penney Co Inc plunged 10 percent to close at $7.37 after the department store chain said on Wednesday that it was ""pleased"" with its holiday season sales without giving specific results. That prompted many on Wall Street to say the retailer's sales may have declined last month.Apollo Education Group Inc shares jumped 14.2 percent to $30.76 after the owner of the University of Phoenix reported a quarterly profit well ahead of Wall Street expectations.The pharmaceutical sector remained a hotbed for mergers and acquisitions. Forest Laboratories agreed to buy privately held specialty pharmaceutical company Aptalis Holdings Inc for about $2.9 billion. Forest Labs' stock surged 17.9 percent to $69.30 and ranked as the S&P 500's biggest gainer.NuPathe Inc leaped 35.6 percent to $4.38 after the company said it received a buyout offer from Israel's Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd  for $114 million plus milestone payments related to NuPathe's migraine treatment. Teva's U.S.-listed shares shed 0.4 percent to $41.05.Volume was modest, with about 6.05 billion shares traded on U.S. exchanges, slightly below the 6.19 billion average so far this month, according to data from BATS Global Markets.Declining stocks outnumbered advancing ones on the New York Stock Exchange by a ratio of 17 to 13, while on the Nasdaq, 13 stocks fell for every 12 that rose.",2014-01-08,ADP,"Wed Jan 8, 2014 | 4:54pm EST",US STOCKS-S&P 500 ends flat in wake of Fed minutes,http://www.reuters.com//article/markets-usa-stocks-idUSL2N0KI29Q20140108?type=companyNews
3,"  * MSCI world equity index pares earlier gains to trade flat* Strong ADP report before Fed minutes lifts stocks, dollar* Market focus now on Friday's December nonfarm payrolls reportBy Herbert LashNEW YORK, Jan 8 The dollar gained while a gauge of global equity markets was little changed on Wednesday after the release of minutes of the Federal Reserve's meeting in December, when policymakers decided to trim the U.S. central bank's asset purchases.Equity markets' early gains were subdued as investors awaited the minutes of the Fed's meeting, when Chairman Ben Bernanke said it would begin trimming its stimulative bond purchases to $75 billion a month from $85 billion a month.The yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury note fell just below 3 percent before the minutes were released, and remained there afterward.""The dollar reaction has been fairly muted to this, and I think that's because for the most part, the information that we've received is not significantly different from what (Bernanke) has been saying over the past few weeks,"" said Brian Dangerfield, currency strategist at RBS Securities in Stamford, Connecticut.The dollar and U.S. stocks mostly rose after payrolls processor ADP said U.S. private employers added a higher-than-expected 238,000 jobs in December, the strongest increase in 13 months.ADP's National Employment Report also revised November's job gains higher, just two days before the government's closely watched monthly nonfarm payrolls report. That data is more comprehensive as it includes both public and private sector employment.Investors are looking to Friday's payrolls report to assess whether the pace and size of the Fed's scaling back of its bond buying either quickens or increases at a meeting later this month. Economists polled by Reuters have forecast 196,000 nonfarm jobs were added to the U.S. economy in December.""If we get a 200,000 or north jobs report on Friday, it increases the likelihood, along with that improving data, the Fed continues its tapering process at the January meeting,"" said Darrell Cronk, regional chief investment officer of Wells Fargo Private Bank in New York.MSCI's world equity index, which tracks shares in 45 countries, pared its early gains to trade flat, just below a six-year high. Overnight in Tokyo, the Nikkei  jumped 1.9 percent to approach its own six-year peak.On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average  ended down 68.2 points, or 0.41 percent, at 16,462.74. The S&P 500 lost 0.39 point, or 0.02 percent, to 1,837.49 and the Nasdaq Composite added 12.43 points, or 0.3 percent, to 4,165.611. European stocks seesawed around 5-1/2-year highs as equity markets in the euro zone periphery extended a rally on rising confidence their economies are starting to recover from the region's debt crisis.German exports rose for the fourth consecutive month in November and industrial orders surged more than expected - mostly based on overseas demand - a sign that Europe's largest economy is benefiting from a nascent global upturn.Spanish bond yields hit fresh four-year lows as markets took an increase in Madrid's planned 2014 debt issuance in stride, confident that rising growth would ensure sales go smoothly.The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading regional shares closed up 0.11 percent at 1,321.19. The blue-chip Euro STOXX 50 index closed flat, losing 0.01 percent.The U.S. dollar gained broadly against the yen, the euro and a basket of currencies. The dollar rose 0.17 percent to 104.78 yen and firmed against the euro, with the single currency last trading 0.26 percent lower at $1.3579.Against a basket of six major currencies, the dollar index  reached a six-week high of 81.048 and was last up 0.24 percent on the day at 81.029.Crude oil prices fell. Brent crude for delivery in February  slipped 20 cents to settle at $107.15 a barrel.U.S. crude fell $1.34 to $92.33 a barrel.U.S. Treasury debt prices fell on the ADP report. The 10-year Treasury note slid 15/32 in price to yield 2.9931 percent, just over a week after hitting a near 2-1/2-year high yield of 3.041 percent, according to Reuters data.Signs of a U.S. recovery have reassured some investors that the world's largest economy can withstand the Fed's decision to scale down its bond-buying program. The program drove many investors into equities by curtailing returns on cash and bonds, helping to fuel much of last year's stock market rally.Markets are hoping the Fed minutes show a clear commitment to keeping rates low for a long time.""What investors were expecting is a confirmation from the Fed in line with the announcement made late last year,"" said Putri Pascualy, credit strategist at fund of funds Pacific Alternative Asset Management Co. in Irvine, California.""It seems that the Fed's intent is no surprises. They have stuck to their goal of telegraphing their intent before the minutes came out and the minutes confirmed a lot of the decisions that were made,"" Pascualy said.The European Central Bank meets on Thursday and analysts doubt it will do more than flag its readiness to act when needed, despite another surprising fall in euro zone inflation.",2014-01-08,ADP,"Wed Jan 8, 2014 | 4:22pm EST","GLOBAL MARKETS-Dollar retains gains, stocks flat after Fed minutes",http://www.reuters.com//article/markets-global-idUSL2N0KI23320140108?type=companyNews

Minutes of the Fed's Dec. 17-18 policy meeting, released on Wednesday, showed many members of the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee wanted to proceed with caution in trimming the asset purchases, and most wanted to stress that further reductions were not on a preset course.      The U.S. central bank's plans to trim its massive bond-buying program by $10 billion to $75 billion per month and an improving U.S. economic outlook will continue to pressure the metal, traders said.      ""Unless there is a significant reduction in jobs, the expectation that the Fed will continue to repeal its bond-buying program remains the main focal point of the market, and that's why gold is under pressure,"" said David Meger, director of metals trading at Chicago futures brokerage Vision Financial Markets.     Spot gold was down 0.4 percent at $1,226.76 an ounce by 3:12 p.m. EST (2012 GMT).     U.S. Comex gold futures for February delivery settled down $4.10 an ounce at $1,225.50, with trading volume about 5 percent below the 250-day average, preliminary Reuters data showed.     Bullion fell after the ADP National Employment Report showed U.S. private employers added a bigger-than-expected 238,000 jobs in December, the strongest increase in 13 months.       ""The trend for much of the rest of the year is likely to be negative for gold as the positive trend of global economic growth reduces investor fears and eases overall demand relative to cyclical investments,"" said Robert Haworth, senior investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management's Private Client Reserve.         Gold was still up almost 2 percent in 2014 on equities losses and fund buying related to index rebalancing after it lost 28 percent last year for its biggest annual loss in 32 years.          INDEX REBALANCING     The yellow metal will see more than $1 billion in fresh buying from the annual rebalancing of the world's two largest commodity indexes beginning Wednesday, a spokesperson for the Standard & Poors Goldman Sachs Commodity Index and the Dow Jones-UBS Commodity Index.      Traders will now focus on U.S. non-farm payrolls and trade numbers on Friday. Non-farm payrolls are seen as a crucial indicator of the U.S. monetary policy outlook, given the Fed has explicitly said it will await an improvement in the jobs market before it accelerates stimulus tapering.     Among other precious metals, silver underperformed, falling 1.5 percent to $19.57 an ounce.

7,"  * MSCI world equity index edges higher* Strong U.S. trade data boosts dollar* U.S. government debt hurt by ADP jobs reportBy Herbert LashNEW YORK, Jan 8 Global equity markets and the dollar edged higher on Wednesday as a pick-up in private sector jobs in the United States and solid German economic data provided further evidence of an increase in worldwide growth.U.S. private employers added a bigger-than-expected 238,000 jobs in December, the strongest increase in 13 months, a report by payrolls processor ADP showed.In Germany, exports rose for the fourth consecutive month in November and industrial orders surged more than expected - mostly based on overseas demand - in a sign that Europe's largest economy is benefiting from a nascent global upturn.An MSCI world equity index that tracks shares in 45 countries rose 0.16 percent to a five-and-a-half year high before backing off that peak. Overnight in Japan, the Nikkei jumped 1.9 percent to approach a six-year peak. ADP's National Employment Report also revised November's job gains higher, coming two days before the government's nonfarm payroll report. That report is more comprehensive as it includes both public and private sector employment.""ADP's number is consistent with other labor numbers we have gotten,"" said Guy Berger, U.S. economist at RBS Securities in Stamford, Connecticut.""It is conceivable that by the end of year, we could see the unemployment rate fall below 6.5 percent,"" he said. ""That would be consistent with the (Federal Reserve's) projected pace of tapering this year.""The Dow Jones industrial average fell 85.77 points, or 0.52 percent, at 16,445.17. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  was down 1.71 points, or 0.09 percent, at 1,836.17. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 10.17 points, or 0.24 percent, at 4,163.35.

8,"   By Ryan Vlastelica | NEW YORK  NEW YORK U.S. private employers hired staff at the fastest pace in 13 months in December, data from a payrolls processor showed Wednesday, burnishing expectations that similar figures due later in the week from the government will confirm the U.S. economy was gathering steam at the end of last year.Companies added 238,000 jobs last month after an upwardly revised 229,000 in November, the ADP National Employment Report showed, topping expectations in a Reuters poll for a gain of 200,000. It was the largest monthly gain since November 2012 and brought a three-month average of corporate hiring to nearly 225,000 a month, the fastest such pace in 21 months.""We're now going to start to see an economic recovery more typical of the economic recoveries we've seen historically,"" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, which jointly develops the report with payrolls processor ADP. ""It feels like the jobs market has kicked into a higher gear.""The data was also likely a welcome affirmation of positive economic momentum for policy makers at the U.S. Federal Reserve, who last month were confident enough in the recent improvement in activity to set plans to scale back their massive stimulus program.U.S. stocks were modestly lower following the report, while the euro fell to a one-month low against the dollar. The dollar .DXY also extended its gains against the yen. U.S. Treasury bond prices extended their decline, with the benchmark 10-year Treasury notes last trading 12/32 lower in price with a yield of 2.982 percent, up 4.5 basis points from late on Monday.The ADP report comes two days ahead of the government's nonfarm payrolls report, a measure of the labor market that is more comprehensive and includes both public and private sector employment. Analysts are looking for 196,000 jobs to have been added in December, and a rise in private payrolls of 195,000. Both numbers would represent slight declines from November.Moody's Zandi said that based on the ADP report, he estimated that payrolls would show 230,000 jobs created in December. In the ADP report, November's job growth figure was revised up to 229,000 from the initially reported 215,000.Separately, applications for U.S. home mortgages rose 2.6 percent in the latest week, rebounding from a 13-year low set at the end of last year, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. Recent data has pointed to an acceleration in economic conditions. On Tuesday, the Commerce Department said the November U.S. trade deficit was the smallest in four years as exports hit a record high and weak oil prices restrained import growth.Also on Wednesday, retail industry tracker ShopperTrak said that sales rose 2.7 percent in the November-December holiday shopping season, boosted by promotions and discounts. J.C. Penney Co Inc (JCP.N), which has struggled to grow its sales after massive declines, described its holiday performance as pleasing, and affirmed its fourth-quarter outlook.Investors have been especially sensitive to signs of economic improvement ever since the U.S. Federal Reserve in December announced that it would begin to slow its massive stimulus program, which was a major contributor to the S&P 500's .SPX rally of nearly 30 percent in 2013.Since the Fed said it would begin to slow the program when certain economic indicators met its targets, some traders had previously taken strong data as a negative because it suggested a faster end to the program.(Additional reporting by Samuel Forgione; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)",2014-01-08,ADP,"Wed Jan 8, 2014 | 11:05am EST",Private sector adds more jobs than expected in December,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-usa-economy-employment-adp-idUSBREA070PD20140108?type=companyNews

11,"  * Dollar index rises to highest in seven weeks after upbeat ADP data* Fed minutes cautious on QE3 taper, but U.S. yields rise* Euro under pressure ahead of ECB policy meeting later Thurs* China inflation shows sharper-than-expected slowingBy Lisa Twaronite and Ian ChuaTokyo/SYDNEY, Jan 9 The dollar hovered close to seven-week highs against a basket of major currencies in Asia on Thursday, after an upbeat U.S. private-sector jobs report drove U.S. short-term yields and market rates higher and raised expectations for key payrolls data later this week.The dollar index was slightly higher on the day at 81.037. It rose as far as 81.166 on Wednesday, a high not seen since late November, after the weekly ADP report showed private employers added a bigger-than-expected 238,000 jobs in December, the strongest increase in 13 months.The ADP data lifted hopes that non-farm payrolls on Friday will surprise on the upside and pushed 2-year Treasury yields to a four-month high of 43 basis points.""The ADP numbers were quite strong, and if the payrolls report surprises on the upside, too, that would help push up the dollar,"" said Ayako Sera, senior market economist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank. Minutes from the Federal Reserve's Dec. 17-18 meeting showed the central bank wanted to err on the side of caution even as it began to scale back its massive bond-buying stimulus.But market participants have already begun to price in tighter policy sooner rather than later, when the tapering is finished. Many expect the central bank to make its final asset purchases at the end of this year, Sera said.Fed fund futures sold off with big losses seen in the late-2015 through to 2018 contracts, such that a first hike in rates is now fully priced for July 2015. Just last month it was not priced in until early 2016.""Our economist thinks the FOMC is on track to continue tapering in measured steps, on course for ending asset purchases by the end of this year. Against this backdrop, we remain constructive on the U.S. dollar,"" analysts at BNP Paribas wrote in a note to clients. The dollar rose to a one-week high of 105.135 yen on Wednesday and was last steady on the day at 104.87 yen. It hit a five-year high of 105.45 yen earlier last week.The dollar is likely to gain against its Japanese counterpart this year on widening yield differentials between the two countries as the Fed tapers and the Bank of Japan, by contrast, keeps its ultra-easy policy stance aimed at stoking inflation.BOJ board member Sayuri Shirai said it might even be desirable to take more than two years to achieve the central bank's inflation target if the burden on households and the corporate sector proves to be excessive, according to the text of a speech released on Thursday.Shirai also said there is a lot of uncertainty about the time frame for the BOJ's 2 percent inflation target and that the central bank has yet to anchor inflation expectations around 2 percent, according to the text of the speech. The euro edged up slightly to $1.3588 after sliding to a one-month low of $1.3552 on Wednesday.The common currency is likely to stay under pressure in the lead up to the European Central Bank policy meeting later on Thursday and could fall further if the ECB highlighted the risk of disinflation, traders said.The euro also edged up against the yen to 142.50  but remained well below last week's five-year high of 105.45 yen.The Australian dollar lost ground against the broadly firmer greenback, dipping back below 89 U.S. cents as it continued to relinquish last week's gains despite data showing the country's retail sales and house building surpassed expectations in November.It was last down 0.3 percent at $0.8878 after earlier brushing a one-week low of $0.8863.But the Aussie was underpinned by Chinese inflation data, which suggested less chance for tighter monetary policy in its biggest trading partner.China's annual consumer inflation slowed more sharply than expected to a seven-month low of 2.5 percent in December.

U.S. private employers added 175,000 jobs in January, the ADP National Employment Report showed on Wednesday, close to analysts expectations. That raised some hopes that Friday's jobs gains will also show solid growth. Economists surveyed by Reuters expect that Friday's jobs data will show that employers added 185,000 jobs in January.      Friday's report is under close attention after weakness in some recent data raised fears over the strength of the U.S. recovery. At the same time, investors have poured out of emerging market assets and stocks, pushing Treasuries yields to three-month lows.     ""There is a bit of pent-up selling pressure. There has been nothing but rallies over the last few weeks and I think this is the result of people looking forward to non-farm payrolls,"" said Aaron Kohli, an interest rate strategist at BNP Paribas in New York. He added that ""rates have baked in a lot of negativity.""     Benchmark 10-year Treasuries yields were last 2.67 percent, after falling from more than 3 percent at the beginning of the year.     The yields fell as low as 2.57 percent on Monday, the lowest since November 1.     The yield decline ""is a huge move in that short a time, since the underlying economic fundamentals haven't deteriorated that much. The buying definitely got a bit overheated,"" said Guy LeBas, chief fixed income strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia.      The 10-year notes have struggled to stay below 2.60 percent as investors who expect yields could increase if Friday's employment data is strong are reticent to buy at the lower yields.     ""I think that most participants are looking for a stronger number, mainly so they can buy at higher yields,"" said Thomas di Galoma, co-head of fixed-income rates at ED&F Man Capital in New York.     Treasuries extended losses on Wednesday after the Institute for Supply Management said its services index rose to 54 last month from 53 in December, and firms added workers at the fastest clip in more than three years.      Some weakening economic data has increased speculation that the Federal Reserve may slow or cease reductions in its bond purchase program if the economy worsens, though many see data as needing to weaken considerably from current levels to alter the Fed's plans.     The Fed last week cut its monthly bond purchases by $10 billion, to $65 billion.     Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart said on Wednesday the U.S. central bank will probably keep steadily dialing back asset purchases and wind them down completely by late 2014. Hawkish Charles Plosser, of the Philadelphia Fed, went a step further and said the Fed should wind down purchases faster and end them before mid-year.      The Fed bought $0.97 billion in Treasuries Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) due from 2040 to 2043 and $2.58 billion in Treasury notes due 2019 to 2021 on Wednesday.      It will buy between $1.00 billion and $1.25 billion in bonds due 2036 to 2043 on Thursday as part of its ongoing purchases.     Treasuries bill yields, meanwhile, continued to rise on Wednesday as investors were wary of buying debt that is exposed to default as the U.S. bumps up again against its debt ceiling.     Washington is due to reinstate a limit on its borrowing at the end of this week and Treasury Secretary Jack Lew has said the administration could use accounting measures to stay under the new cap until the end of February.     Yields on the on-the-run one-month Treasuries bills that come due on March 6 rose to 12 basis points on Tuesday, the highest since October, when the debt ceiling was last an issue.     The U.S. Treasury also said on Wednesday it will sell $70 billion in new coupon-bearing debt next week, but that it may cut auction sizes at its next quarterly refunding because of a faster-than-expected narrowing of the nation's budget deficit.       Next week's sales will include $30 billion in three-year notes, $24 billion in 10-year notes and $16 billion in 30-year bonds. The Treasury added that reopening sized for future auctions of the government's new two-year floating rate notes are likely to be between $12 billion and $15 billion.

15,"  * U.S. service sector activity rebounds* Service sector hiring strongest in three years* Weather pinches hiring, ADP weakest since AugustBy David GaffenFeb 5 Growth picked up in the U.S. service sector in January, with steady strength in private-sector hiring, suggesting the winter weather that socked the country over the last several weeks had a limited effect on the economy.The data assuaged some concerns that arose from a recent run of weaker-than-expected reports on sales of durable goods, manufacturing activity and January car sales, which were affected in part by the heavy snow and ice that has hit large swaths of the country.U.S. private employers added 175,000 jobs in January, the smallest gain since August, according to payrolls processor ADP, in part due to the weather. December's increase in jobs was revised down to 227,000 from the initially reported 238,000. The report is jointly developed with Moody's Analytics.The overall pace of job growth wasn't far off ADP's recent trend, and hiring indexes in both the Institute for Supply Management survey and a separate service-sector survey from Markit kept investors optimistic the U.S. Labor Department's nonfarm payrolls report on Friday will show January hiring rebounded after a weak December, which saw a payroll gain of just 74,000.""ADP offset some of the concern from the weak December payrolls report and showed that the labor market is pretty much where it was most of last year,"" said Omair Sharif, senior U.S. economist at RBS Americas in Stamford, Connecticut. After two months of slower growth, the Institute for Supply Management said on Wednesday its services index rose to 54 last month from 53 in December, and firms added workers at the fastest clip in more than three years. The 50 level separates expansion from contraction.The data comes after a period of weak economic reports, lackluster holiday sales from large retailers, and as the U.S. Federal Reserve continues its wind-down of monthly bond buying that had supported financial asset prices and helped keep borrowing costs low.The Fed last week reduced its monthly buying by $10 billion to $65 billion, and is on track to end its purchases by the end of 2014. Some have expressed concern about the reduction in support just as currency crises have erupted in various emerging markets, in part because of the decline in liquidity.The U.S. equity market ended 2013 with gains of 30 percent, but it has since lost ground in part due to weak data. In Wednesday trading, stocks trimmed earlier losses and were little changed, but investors found few reasons to buy. Bond yields were marginally higher after a rally that took benchmark yields to levels not seen since November. ""Economic data is not bad, but not compelling - markets prefer easy policy over good data,"" said Michael O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading.That said, at this time the Fed does not appear inclined to sway from its course. Dennis Lockhart, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, said that unless the economic outlook worsens, ""I think it is reasonable to expect a progression of similar moves, with the asset purchase program completely wound down by the fourth quarter of the year.""Charles Plosser, president of the Philadelphia Fed and one of the more hawkish members of the board, said on Wednesday he worries the U.S. central bank's accommodative policies will lead it to have to ""chase"" the market when in the future it attempts to tighten policy.The ADP report is often looked at as a precursor to the government's payrolls data. A Reuters survey on the payrolls report showed economists estimate that 185,000 jobs were created last month, all of them in the private sector. January marked the 49th straight month the ISM index was above 50, though the pace of growth has slowed from a more than seven-year high.Sub-indexes on business activity and new orders also showed improved growth, alleviating some concern caused by ISM's manufacturing report earlier this week that showed the new orders index suffered its biggest drop in 33 years in January. Employment rose to 56.4, the highest level since November of 2010.Sharif cautioned, however, that the ISM report showed the number of people saying orders are lower remained elevated, with two straight months where more people said orders were lower than higher.""That's not a great sign and needs to be monitored carefully going forward,"" he said.Markit's report on service-sector activity showed growth there quickened to a four-month high in January and hiring remained robust. Financial data firm Markit said its services sector purchasing managers index rose to 56.7 from 55.7 in December.Economic activity has been affected by severe weather in many parts of the country, with sub-freezing temperatures hitting wide swathes of the Northeast, West and Midwest states in recent weeks. Another storm hit overnight, causing almost 900,000 homes and businesses to lose power, according to local power companies.",2014-02-05,ADP,"Wed Feb 5, 2014 | 2:51pm EST","WRAPUP 3-U.S. service sector growth, hiring improves in January",http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-economy-idUSL2N0LA0UJ20140205?type=companyNews

U.S. data is being closely watched after a weak reading in the factory sector on Monday sent Wall Street into a tailspin and triggered a global equity selloff. Wednesday's data left investors with little clarity about the economic impact from the harsh weather this winter.Growth picked up in the dominant U.S. services sector in January, with steady strength in private-sector hiring. The data suggested that the U.S. economy was digging through the winter weather that socked the country over the last several weeks.""Clearly, we are getting that support off that 1,740 area, which has held so far this week, at least,"" said Ryan Detrick, senior technical strategist at Schaeffer's Investment Research in Cincinnati. ""Today's (data) almost just added to the confusion, or added to the indecision, as to what exactly should we believe - is it weather-related or is it not - and that is the big question that isn't answered yet and won't be answered for a little bit of time.""The Dow Jones industrial average rose 13.52 points or 0.09 percent, to 15,458.76.

U.S. private employers added 175,000 jobs in January, the ADP National Employment Report showed on Wednesday.       Economists surveyed by Reuters expect that Friday's jobs data will show that employers added 185,000 jobs in January.     ""There is a bit of pent up selling pressure, there has been nothing but rallies over the last few weeks and I think this is the result of people looking forward to non-farm payrolls,"" said Aaron Kohli, an interest rate strategist at BNP Paribas in New York, adding that ""rates have baked in a lot of negativity.""     Benchmark 10-year Treasuries yields were last 2.65 percent, after falling from more than 3 percent at the beginning of the year as investors flee emerging market assets and stocks tumble, increasing the safe-haven demand for U.S. government debt.     The 10-year notes have struggled to stay below yields of 2.60 percent, however, as investors that expect yields could rise on stronger economic momentum are reticent to buy at the lower yields.     ""I think that most participants are looking for a stronger number, mainly so they can buy at higher yields,"" said Thomas di Galoma, co-head of fixed-income rates at ED&F Man Capital in New York.     Weakening economic data has increased speculation that the Federal Reserve may slow or cease reductions in its bond purchase program if the economy worsens, though many see data as needing to weaken considerably from current levels to alter the Fed's plans.     The Fed last week cut its monthly bond purchases by $10 billion, to $65 billion. It bought $0.97 billion in Treasuries Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) due from 2040 to 2043 on Wednesday as part of its ongoing purchase program and will buy between $2.50 billion and $3.0 billion in Treasury notes due 2019 to 2021 later on Wednesday in a separate operation.      Treasuries bill yields, meanwhile, continued to rise on Wednesday as investors were wary of buying debt that is exposed to default as the U.S. bumps up again against its debt ceiling.     Washington is due to reinstate a limit on its borrowing at the end of this week and Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said the administration could use accounting measures to stay under the new cap until the end of February.

25,"  * Yen extends broad slide, focus shifts to data     * Euro lower against the dollar ahead of ECB meeting     * ADP report shows U.S. jobs gain of 139,000     * U.S. services sector at 4-year low      By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss     NEW YORK, March 5 The dollar edged higher against the euro and yen on Wednesday, shrugging off softer-than-expected U.S. private-sector payrolls and services sector reports affected by severe winter conditions.     Recent weakness in U.S. economic data is not expected to deter the Federal Reserve from gradually reducing its asset purchase, a scenario that is positive for the dollar.     U.S. private employers added 139,000 jobs in February, lower than market expectations, while services sector growth hit a four-year low of 51.6.        And there is a growing view that given the weaker-than forecast ADP National Employment report, Friday's U.S. non-farm payrolls number could likewise disappoint. Economists polled by Reuters expect U.S. job gains of 150,000 last month.     Still many expect the dollar to hold up well.     ""The winter weather is going to strike again and provide  another disappointing payrolls number but we still think the dollar could strengthen,"" said Andrew Dilz, currency trader at Tempus Consulting in Washington.     ""If non-farm payrolls come out weaker as we expect, I don't think it's going to have a huge effect on the Federal Reserve, as nothing seems to be putting them off track in terms of tapering.""     Investors were also focused on the European Central Bank's monetary policy meeting on Thursday, which analysts expect will result in some form of policy easing to ward off deflationary risks in the euro zone. That expectation has led to weakness in the euro against the dollar.     The dollar's gains were also helped by losses in the yen, which fell for a second straight day as concerns over a Russia-Ukraine standoff eased.      Markets, however, are keeping an eye on the region after Russia test-fired an intercontinental ballistic missile from a base not far from eastern Ukraine to a range in Kazakhstan.        In late trading, the euro was down 0.1 percent versus the dollar at $1.3728, pulling back from Friday's two-month high of $1.3824.     Despite better-than-expected retail sales data for January and a survey that showed euro zone private-sector business growing at its fastest pace in more than 2-1/2 months in February, investors sold the euro on the risk that the ECB could loosen policy on Thursday.     Inflation is running well below the ECB's target of just under 2 percent, and the central bank is under pressure to pull it out of a ""danger zone"" that threatens to stall the region's fragile recovery.      Indeed, overnight euro/dollar implied volatility, a gauge of how sharp currency swings will be, jumped to 11.50 percent from around 5 percent at the start of the week.     The euro was flat against the yen at 140.42 yen  after gaining 0.8 percent on Tuesday, while the dollar rose 0.1 percent at 102.29 yen after posting its biggest one-day gain since mid-January a day earlier.      The greenback was also slightly up against the Swiss franc  at 0.8870 franc.     Demand for safety faded on Tuesday after Russian President Vladimir Putin played down the prospect of a war in Ukraine, but market players remained on watch as Russian stock markets   fell more than 1 percent on Wednesday.

Employers added 191,000 workers last month, while gains for February were revised upward, according to the report.March U.S. nonfarm payrolls are scheduled for release by the federal government on Friday. Some currency traders say a strong showing will fuel a rally in the greenback.""Everyone's still waiting for the actual jobs numbers on Friday, and that's limiting the movement of the dollar,"" said Nick Bennenbrock, currency strategist at Wells Fargo Securities in New York. ""It's muted."" Major currency pairs have all been stuck in tight ranges since mid-February, with bets for a run higher by the dollar having been thwarted by a combination of nerves over economic slowdown in China and some worse than expected U.S. data.That has begun to turn around in the past couple of weeks and dealers are beginning to speculate the nonfarm payrolls numbers on Friday may have the potential to turn the dollar sharply higher. The heart of that argument is the assumption that, should the numbers begin to look more robust, U.S. interest rates will be raised early next year, while those in Europe and Japan will stay flat or be suppressed further.""When we had that signal from (U.S. Federal Reserve Chair) Janet Yellen that rates could rise early next year, the line for many was that they wanted more confirmation before really betting on it,"" said a dealer at one large U.S. bank in London.The euro was off 0.11 percent against the dollar at $1.3777 but is looking more robust than it did a week ago, when it was struck by hints that the Bundesbank's resistance to outright money-printing by the European Central Bank may be fading.Several ECB officials have since emphasised the temporary nature of current low inflation - 0.5 percent in March - and that has supported expectations the bank will do nothing when it ends its monthly policy meeting on Thursday.

50,"  (Corrects ninth paragraph to show ADP report was for April)* First-quarter growth slows sharply to 0.1 percent rate* Exports, inventories take a bite out of GDP growth* Consumer spending up solidly, healthcare a boostBy Lucia MutikaniWASHINGTON, April 30 The U.S. economy barely grew in the first quarter as the severe winter hampered exports and led businesses to curtail investment spending, but activity already appears to be bouncing back.Gross domestic product expanded at a 0.1 percent annual rate, the slowest since the fourth quarter of 2012, the Commerce Department said on Wednesday.""This quarter was impacted heavily by the weather. Growth is down, but not out, not by a long shot, and we look for it to quicken later on in the spring,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ in New York.The slowdown, which also reflected the slowest inventory accumulation in nearly a year, was much sharper than Wall Street had braced for. Economists expected a 1.2 percent gain.It suggested the economy could struggle to achieve the 3 percent break-out growth that had been widely anticipated this year, but did little to alter forecasts for coming quarters.U.S. stocks were little changed after opening lower on the report. Prices for U.S. government debt were up, while the dollar fell against a basket of currencies. The government's first snapshot of first-quarter growth was released just hours before the Federal Reserve wraps up a two-day policy meeting.With growth pinned down by temporary factors, Fed officials are likely to brush aside the slowdown and focus on other data that has suggested strength at the tail end of the quarter.Separate reports on Wednesday showed private employers added 220,000 workers to their payrolls in April, while business activity in the Midwest hit a six-month high, with new orders surging and employment rising.Still, the magnitude of the slowdown could complicate the U.S. central bank's message as it sets to announce a further reduction in the amount of money it is pumping into the economy through monthly bond purchases. NO FUNDAMENTAL WEAKNESS ""Our bet is that the weakness we saw in the first quarter  is more transitory than fundamental, with a heavy dose of weather distortions,"" said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial in Chicago.Economists estimate severe weather could have chopped off as much as 1.4 percentage points from GDP growth. The government, however, gave no details on the impact of the weather.Businesses restocked inventories to the tune of $111.7 billion in the final three months of last year, but added only $87.4 billion more to stocks in the first quarter, the smallest amount since the second quarter of 2013.The slowdown in restocking subtracted 0.57 percentage point from GDP growth in the first quarter, but inventories should be a boost to second-quarter growth. ""It looks like most of the inventory correction will be contained in the first quarter,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan in New York.Trade lopped off 0.83 percentage point from growth, partly because of the weather, which left goods piling up at ports. Exports fell at a 7.6 percent rate, the largest quarterly decline in five years, after growing at a 9.5 percent pace in the final three months of 2013.A measure of domestic demand that strips out exports and inventories expanded at a 1.5 percent rate and there were virtually little signs of inflation pressures.Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, increased at a 3.0 percent rate, reflecting a spurt in spending on services linked to demand for heating and the Affordable Healthcare Act, which expanded healthcare coverage to many Americans.Spending on services grew at its quickest pace since the second quarter of 2000, with  healthcare contributing a solid 1.10 percentage points to GDP growth.Spending on goods, however, slowed sharply, indicating that the frigid temperatures had reduced foot traffic to shopping malls. Consumer spending had increased at a brisk 3.3 percent pace in the fourth-quarter.Harsh weather also undercut business spending on equipment, which fell at its fastest pace in nearly five years. While investment in nonresidential structures, such as gas drilling, rebounded, the increase was minor.Investment in home building contracted for a second straight quarter, another sign of the hit from the weather, although a rise in mortgage rates over the past year has also hurt.A second quarter of contraction in spending on home building suggests a housing recession. A bounce back, however, is expected in the April-June period.""The technical recession in housing is a major yellow flag in terms of the strength of the domestic economy. It will be while before the Fed starts raising interest rates,"" said Brian Bethune, chief economist at Alpha Economic Foresights in Boston.

Many market participants, however, are becoming concerned about the sector, with the index is up for the 10th straight session and up 14 percent for the year so far.Key semiconductor markets like industrials and autos are likely to face slow demand in the second half of the year, according to a Goldman Sachs research note. The note also pointed out that inventories are building and the sector's valuation is no longer attractive.The CBOE Volatility Index jumped 0.9 percent, its third straight daily advance. The VIX, known as the ""fear index,"" remained just below 12 and well below the historical average of 20 - a trend that some interpret as a sign that investors have become complacent. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 9.25 points or 0.06 percent, to 16,731.59. The S&P 500 gained 3.21 points or 0.17 percent, to 1,927.45. The Nasdaq Composite  added 18.24 points or 0.43 percent, to 4,252.32.If the S&P 500 closes higher on Wednesday, that will mark its eighth advance out of the past nine sessions - a run in which the broad index has set multiple record highs.In macroeconomic news, the Institute for Supply Management's non-manufacturing index showed that growth in the U.S. services sector accelerated more than expected in May and rose at the fastest pace in nine months. The ADP National Employment Report showed that fewer private-sector jobs were added in May than had been anticipated. ""With some data strong and other data weak, we don't have a clear picture of the market or the economy right now,"" said Adam Sarhan, chief executive officer of Sarhan Capital in New York.""We don't seem to be strong enough to grow without help from the Federal Reserve, but we do seem to be trending in the right direction.""While economic reports have largely been positive lately, investors are concerned about any data that could indicate weakness in Friday's May jobs report.In company news, Protective Life surged 18.1 percent to $69.33 in heavy trading after Japan's Dai-ichi Life Insurance Co agreed to buy the company for $5.7 billion.The stock of Tibco Software Inc was one of the Nasdaq's most active, slumping 6.7 percent to $19.40 a day after the company gave a second-quarter outlook sharply below expectations.NQ Mobile Inc soared 37.1 percent to $10.46, its biggest one-day advance ever, rising on heavy volume after the Chinese mobile security software maker said a special committee had found no evidence of fraud, following an accusation made by short-seller Muddy Waters Research Group.

57,"  * Dollar index pulls further away from eight-month trough* Solid U.S. private-sector hiring lifts hope for nonfarm payrolls* Aussie dollar eyes RBA speech, retail sales dataBy Ian ChuaSYDNEY, July 3 The U.S. dollar clung onto modest gains early on Thursday, having risen broadly on the back of a report that showed solid hiring in the U.S. private sector.The figures from payrolls processor ADP added to a string of bullish U.S. data ranging from manufacturing to auto sales, supporting the view that the U.S. economy has bounced back smartly after a first-quarter slump.Benchmark U.S. Treasury yields rose to the highest in over a week at 2.63 percent in reaction to the data, which in turned helped lift the dollar against a basket of major currencies.The dollar index was last at 79.956, off an eight-week trough of 79.740 plumbed on Tuesday. Against the yen, the greenback rose to 101.78, having only recently hit a six-week low of 101.23. The euro dipped to $1.3657, from Tuesday's six-week high of $1.3724.ADP said private employers added 281,000 workers to payrolls last month, the largest since November 2012, offering hopes for a healthy rise in nonfarm payrolls when the data is released later on Thursday.""Our economists agree with market consensus looking for non-farm payrolls to rise by more than 200,000 for a fifth consecutive month,"" analysts at BNP Paribas wrote in a note to clients. ""If the forecast turns out to be correct, this will mark the first five-month run of above 200,000 prints since January 2000.""But anyone expecting a more hawkish tone from the Federal Reserve were left sorely disappointed after Fed Chair Janet Yellen stuck to her dovish script.Speaking at an International Monetary Fund event on Wednesday, Yellen reiterated her view that regulation - not rate policy - needs to play the lead role in combating excessive financial risk-taking.Analysts said Yellen was pushing back against some Fed officials who believe financial stability should be given a more prominent place in formulating monetary policy.

58,"  * Investors take cue from dovish stand of U.S. Fed     * U.S. yields moved lower after jobs data in past 3 months     * Robust ADP data boosts chances of upside June payrolls surprise      By Richard Leong     NEW YORK, July 2 Don't look for U.S. bond yields to stray far from current levels even if the government on Thursday says the economy produced more than 200,000 jobs for a fifth straight month in June.     That's because bond traders and investors are taking Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen at her word when she says recent robust U.S. employment data is out of step with other factors, like substandard wage growth, that are keeping the economy in low gear.     So far this year, bond yields have shown little impetus to lift off despite an average of 231,000 new jobs created monthly from February through May, the most-robust pace in more than two years. In fact, the benchmark 10-year yield is still about 0.40 percentage point below where it began this year.     Ahead of the June jobs data, due Thursday morning, the market's behavior is tracking a recent pattern. In the days before three of the past four nonfarm payrolls reports, yields have risen, only to fall after the Labor Department data hits.     Many economists and bond investors remain unconvinced that the chunky headline figure in recent nonfarm payrolls reports is evidence of a self-sustaining recovery in U.S. economic activity and employment.      They point to 2.1 million Americans who have stopped looking for work.      Moreover, those with jobs have seen meager wage growth of about 2 percent a year since the recession, a factor that increasingly has come into focus since Yellen took over as Fed chair in February. She has argued that the weak pay is restraining consumer spending and holding inflation below the Fed's target of 2 percent.      In fact, in Yellen's first meeting as head of the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's policy-making arm scrapped its reference to a 6.5 percent unemployment rate as a potential milestone for a turn toward tighter policy. The unemployment rate was 6.3 percent in May and is estimated to have remained at that level in June.      ""The Fed has shifted a lot of the attention to GDP and inflation from jobs as the sole indicator for rates. The bond market has responded as such to it,"" said Gennadiy Goldberg, interest rate strategist at TD Securities in New York.     Figuring into this economic backdrop are billions of dollars from yield-hungry investors abroad and concerns over violence in the Middle East and Ukraine. The intense demand for stable income and low-risk assets like U.S. bonds will likely keep benchmark yields near historical lows.     Still, the bond sell-off in the first two days of the second half of 2014 suggested some jitters about a strong June payroll reading, especially in the aftermath of Wednesday's blowout reading of private employment from payroll processor ADP. It showed 281,000 private sector jobs were created last month, the most since November 2012.       Economists are looking for 212,000 jobs from the government report on Thursday morning at 08:30 EDT (12:30 GMT). Even if it has lost some of its clout recently, it is still the most anticipated U.S. datapoint each month.     ""It's not more important or less important. It's just as important,"" said Michael Cuggino, president at Permanent Portfolio Funds in San Francisco.

Trade was quiet, with volume low and the S&P's intra-day range a mere 0.2 percent, the narrowest since 1993, according to research firm MKM Partners. Nonetheless, the miniscule gains on the Dow and S&P 500 allowed the indexes to end at record highs.The Dow ended 0.2 percent below 17,000, moving within 15 points of that milestone at its session high, while the S&P 500 was less than 1.5 percent under its own landmark of 2,000. Both levels could serve as psychological barriers as the market trades at record highs.U.S. private employers hired 281,000 workers in June, far exceeding expectations for 200,000, data from payrolls processor ADP showed. The number bodes well for the government payroll data due before the market opens on Thursday. A gain of about 212,000 jobs is expected in that report, down from May's 217,000. ""The odds are pretty good that we'll break through 17,000 soon, but people are hesitant to put on big bets ahead of the payroll report, especially with market liquidity so thin,"" said Jim McDonald, who oversees $915 billion as chief investment strategist at Chicago-based Northern Trust Global Investments. ""It makes sense to see a little consolidation after yesterday's gains.""The Dow Jones industrial average rose 20.17 points or 0.12 percent, to 16,976.24, the S&P 500 gained 1.3 points or 0.07 percent, to 1,974.62 and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 0.92 points or 0.02 percent, to 4,457.73.

60,"  (Adds prices, comment, ECB outlook)* ADP payrolls show strong gains* Investors wary of verbal intervention from ECB's Draghi* Sterling at six-year highs on upbeat dataBy Gertrude Chavez-DreyfussNEW YORK, July 2 The dollar rose broadly on Wednesday after a report showed the economy created the most U.S. private sector jobs in 1-1/2 years last month.The report boded well for Thursday's U.S. nonfarm payrolls report, and provided a boost to the dollar, which has struggled this year despite the Federal Reserve reducing its monthly asset purchases. Private U.S. employers added 281,000 workers to payrolls in June, up from 179,000 in May, payrolls processor ADP said on Wednesday. June's gains, which topped economists' expectations for an increase of only 200,000, were the largest since November 2012.""While the ADP report may not be a 'game-changer', it will leave recently established short-dollar positions somewhat exposed and we would expect it to provide the currency with some degree of support heading into Thursday's full employment report,"" said Bob Lynch, head of currency strategy at HSBC in New York.A Reuters poll showed a U.S. non-farm payrolls forecast of 212,000 jobs. ""Any figure above 200,000 would likely be encouraging for the growth of the U.S. economy, but it also means the Federal Reserve would likely continue moving closer to, and perhaps even accelerate, the end of quantitative easing and an eventual interest rate hike,"" said Neal Gilbert, senior market analyst at FOREX.com in Grand Rapids, Michigan.In late New York trading, the dollar index rose 0.2 percent to 79.956. Against the yen, the dollar was up 0.3 percent as well at 101.79 yen.The euro, meanwhile, fell 0.2 percent to $1.3656. Europe's common currency also lost steam on concern policy makers will intervene verbally to keep the currency from strengthening. It fell to a 1 1/2-year low against the British pound, which was again lifted by better-than-expected data.The European Central Bank is scheduled to meet on Thursday to discuss interest rate policy. But after last month's barrage of policy changes, the ECB is unlikely to do much, analysts said.Investors are still waiting for details of the new long-term lending program and ECB President Mario Draghi is bound to be asked at his news conference about whether he is ready to start quantitative easing.Sterling earlier hit a six-year high against the dollar after forecast-busting UK construction data and more evidence of an upswing in the housing market. Both heightened expectations that the Bank of England will tighten policy before the year's end.But the pound was last flat at $1.7153, weighed down by a strong U.S. private sector jobs report.

U.S. companies hired 281,000 workers in June, marking the biggest monthly increase since November 2012, the ADP National Employment Report showed. That was well above economists' expectations for 200,000 jobs, according to a Reuters poll.       ""It was an unassailably good number - you couldn't fault it,"" said David Keeble, global head of interest rates strategy at Credit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank in New York. He said his firm had raised its expectations for nonfarm payrolls to 250,000 from 220,000 after the ADP report.     Economists expect U.S. employers to have added 212,000 jobs in June, down slightly from 217,000 jobs in May, according to a Reuters poll.     Safe-haven Treasuries prices stayed lower despite data showing a drop in new orders for U.S. factory goods in May. The Commerce Department said on Wednesday new orders for manufactured goods decreased 0.5 percent. That was steeper than the 0.3 percent decline forecast by analysts.      An acceleration in private jobs growth was ""a much more important piece of information than the minor difference in factory orders,"" said Robert Tipp, chief investment strategist at Prudential Fixed Income in Newark, New Jersey.     Analysts said remarks by U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen had no discernible effect on Treasuries prices. Yellen, who spoke at an event hosted by International Monetary Fund Director Christine Lagarde, said monetary policy faces ""significant limitations"" as a tool to counter financial stability risks.      ""Most of what (Yellen) said was fairly accepted in academic circles - it wasn't really breaking fresh ground,"" said Credit Agricole's Keeble.     Benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury notes were last down 16/32 in price to yield 2.62 percent, up from a yield of 2.57 percent late Tuesday.

65,"  NEW YORK U.S. private payrolls recorded their largest gain in 1-1/2 years in June as businesses stepped up hiring, reinforcing views the economy has rebounded from its first-quarter slump.Private employers added 281,000 workers to payrolls, up from  179,000 in May, payrolls processor ADP said on Wednesday. June's gains, which topped economists' expectations for an increase of only 200,000 jobs, was the largest since November 2012.Coming a day before the release of the government's comprehensive employment report for June, the ADP report increased the likelihood of another month of strong nonfarm payrolls growth, economists said.""It signals continued strengthening in job creation and increases our confidence that payrolls for June may have posted their fifth consecutive 200,000-plus monthly gain,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.Nonfarm payrolls probably increased by 212,000 in June after rising 217,000 the prior month, according to a Reuters poll of economists. The ADP report, which is jointly developed with Moody's Analytics, was the latest indication the decline in economic growth in the first three months of the year was temporary. Gross domestic product contracted at a 2.9 percent annual pace in the first quarter. Automobile sales surged in June and factories continue to expand at a steady clip. Housing, which has struggled following a run-up in mortgage rates last year, is also showing signs of life. Prices for U.S. Treasury debt fell on the ADP data, while the dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. stocks were poised to open slightly higher.Last month, job gains in the private sector were broad-based. Construction payrolls increased 36,000, the biggest gain since February 2006.  Manufacturing added 12,000 jobs. Professional business services employers hired 77,000 workers last month, the most since November 2012.""Judging from the job market, the economic recovery remains fully intact and is gaining momentum,"" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.

June's gains, which topped economists' expectations for an increase of only 200,000, were the largest since November 2012. ""While the ADP report may not be a 'game-changer', it will leave recently established short-dollar positions somewhat exposed and we would expect it to provide the currency with some degree of support heading into Thursday's full employment report,"" said Bob Lynch, head of currency strategy at HSBC in New York.In mid-morning New York trading, the dollar index rose 0.2 percent to 79.961. Against the yen, the dollar was up 0.2 percent as well at 101.70 yen. The euro, meanwhile, fell 0.2 percent to $1.3650.Europe's common currency also lost steam on concern policy makers will intervene verbally to keep the currency from strengthening. It fell to a 1 1/2-year low against the British pound, which was again lifted by better-than-expected data.Sterling earlier hit a six-year high against the dollar after forecast-busting UK construction data and more evidence of an upswing in the housing market. Both heightened expectations that the Bank of England will tighten policy before the year's end.But the pound was last flat at $1.7152, weighed down by a strong U.S. private sector jobs report.

67,"  * US nonfarm payrolls rise 288,000 in June     * Unemployment rate falls to 6.1 pct     * Palladium hits fresh 13-year high   (Adds analyst comment, double byline, updates market activity)     By Frank Tang and Clara Denina      NEW YORK/LONDON, July 3 Gold slipped on Thursday after U.S. nonfarm payrolls rose more than expected in June, fueling expectations U.S. interest rates could rise earlier than expected.      U.S. employment growth jumped in June and the jobless rate closed in on a six-year low, compelling evidence the economy was growing briskly heading into the second half of the year.     Nonfarm payrolls increased by 288,000 jobs and the unemployment rate declined to 6.1 percent, the Labor Department said on Thursday.      ""It is interesting that we are well into the territory now that one would expect a normalization of monetary policy,"" said Mitsubishi Corp analyst Jonathan Butler. ""There is still downside risk there on gold,"" he added.     Fed policymakers have in the past promised to keep rates near zero until U.S. unemployment falls below 5.5 percent, as long as inflation and financial stability risks are contained.      Spot gold was down 0.6 percent to $1,319.15 an ounce by 2:04 PM EDT (1404 GMT), having earlier dropped as much as 1.3 percent to a one-week low of $1,309.64.     U.S. COMEX gold futures for August delivery settled  down $10.30 at $1,320.60 an ounce, with trading volume about 30 percent above its 30-day average, preliminary Reuters data showed.     Some analysts argue that gold can rise in tandem with higher interest rates.     ""If interest rates start rising, it's because the Fed is worried about inflation, and that inflation factor can drive gold prices up even as interest rates rise,"" said Jeffrey Christian, managing director at CPM Group.     A low interest-rate environment has been key to higher gold prices since the 2008 credit crisis, however, as investors were more willing to put their money in noninterest-bearing assets.     Traders said gold could also receive a boost in the longer run after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said a raft of policy measures introduced last month will help lift inflation and support bank lending.      Among other metals, palladium was up 0.4 percent at $855.60 an ounce.     Palladium, mostly employed in gasoline autocatalysts, predominantly used in the United States and China, rose to its highest level since February 2001 at $864.45 an ounce, as good U.S. data lifted prospects for stronger auto demand.     Platinum was down 0.5 percent at $1,494.25 an ounce, hovering near a 10-month high of $1,517.50 reached on Wednesday, while silver ended unchanged at $21.09 an ounce.       2:04 PM EDT     LAST/    NET   PCT      LOW    HIGH  CURRENT                 SETTLE   CHNG  CHNG                       VOL  US Gold AUG   1320.60 -10.30  -0.8  1309.40 1329.00  139,120  US Silver SEP  21.137 -0.165  -0.8   20.820  21.230   38,995  US Plat OCT   1507.70  -3.80  -0.3  1494.50 1511.30   10,448  US Pall SEP    861.90   4.50   0.5   849.10  867.45    5,540                                                                 Gold          1319.15  -7.99  -0.6  1309.64 1327.39           Silver         21.090  0.000   0.0   20.850  21.160  Platinum      1494.25  -7.25  -0.5  1492.90 1506.25  Palladium      855.60   3.40   0.4   849.50  864.45                                                                 TOTAL MARKET              VOLUME          30-D ATM VOLATILITY                 CURRENT   30D AVG  250D AVG   CURRENT     CHG  US Gold        155,048   120,472   164,401     13.08   -0.77  US Silver       40,949    70,978    54,619     19.41   -0.57  US Platinum     10,630    17,767    12,178     17.04    0.51  US Palladium     6,210     5,083     5,833      19.3   -0.80                                                                   (Additional reporting by A.

Not only did you have a gangbusters headline and private read but you had a diffusion index that was 64.8, which shows significantly healthy breadth,"" said Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz SE. ""It's a report that really checks off all the positive boxes, I don't think you could have asked for a stronger read.""The prospect of a relatively near-term rise in U.S. rates that would finally end the era of near-zero borrowing costs saw U.S. stock futures pare gains ahead of the start of U.S. trading and trigger a small dip in MSCI's record-high All World index .The dollar also rose in the currency market, hitting a session high against the yen and the euro as markets also tuned in for the monthly European Central Bank news conference as it fleshed out last month's easing measures. ECB President Mario Draghi said the risks facing the euro zone economy meant interest rates will stay low for an extended period and detailed plans for a new, conditional tranche of ultra-cheap loans to banks that it hopes will lift the economy.U.S. government bond yields - which move inversely to prices - also rose, climbing to 2.68 percent for the first time in two weeks as the prospect of rising U.S. interest rates dampened their appeal.The contrast with the dovish ECB took the premium of 10-year treasuries over their German equivalent, the Bund, to its highest since 1999.

Stocks edged higher along with Spanish and Italian bonds while the euro barely budged against a slightly stronger dollar.The ECB is expected to detail last month's aggressive easing plans, and forecasts are for non-farm payrolls to rise by more than 200,000 for a fifth straight month, bolstering the view the world's largest economy is back on track after a difficult winter.""The main thing today will be the non-farm payrolls,"" said Valentijn van Nieuwenhuijzen, the head of multi-asset funds at ING investment management.""""(President Mario) Draghi will be doing his best to make the ECB meeting a non-event, but after all the strong U.S. data this week, the ADP, ISM, the car sales data, (payrolls) could be the thing that finally convinces markets that they can't ignore it any more."" European stocks climbed 0.4 percent, heading for their third consecutive day of gains and keeping MSCI's All World index, which covers 45 countries, flush with Wednesday's latest record high.The dollar was also up, copper on the London Metal Exchange  hit its highest level since late February, and safe-haven gold was down amid a lull in tensions in Iraq and Ukraine.DOLLAR, TREASURIES NUDGE HIGHER The euro was hovering just below a six-week high at $1.3648 as German Bund yields nosed higher.

That helped drive benchmark U.S. Treasury yields  to their highest in over a week at 2.63 percent on Wednesday, which in turned supported the dollar against a basket of major currencies.Yields could rise further if Thursday's jobs data beats expectations. The dollar was up 0.1 percent against the yen at 101.90 yen and firmer against the Swiss franc.The euro barely reacted to the ECB decision, trading slightly lower at $1.3650, with investors cautious before Draghi's post-meeting news conference. It is due to start just as the U.S. jobs numbers are released at 1230 GMT.After cutting interest rates to record lows and revealing a 400 billion-euro loan programme last month, the ECB is not expected to take fresh policy action this time. ""Yet with inflation so low at 0.5 percent, year-on-year, we find it unlikely President Draghi will be happy to say nothing and allow euro/dollar to stage another assault on $1.40 again,"" said Chris Turner, head of currency strategy at ING.""Short-term rate spreads suggest euro/dollar should be trading closer to $1.34 than $1.37.""SWEDISH CROWN, AUSSIE STUNG  The Riksbank surprised a market that was expecting only a 25 basis point cut in the repo rate, and the Swedish crown fell to its lowest since November 2010 against the euro.The euro rose to 9.39 crowns, from around 9.1950 crowns before the rate decision. It was last trading at 9.3274 crowns, up 1.8 percent on the day.The Swedish crown's drop led to a sell-off in the Norwegian crown too. It sank to a 2014 low against the euro with the single currency hitting a peak of 8.53 crowns, its highest since December 2013. Both currencies saw a surge in trading volumes on the Reuters Dealing platforms.""Nordic central banks will now strive to keep their currencies weak and support inflation expectations so there is not much value in looking at longs,"" said Geoff Yu, currency strategist at UBS.

Economists expect U.S. employers to have added 212,000 jobs in June, down slightly from 217,000 in May, according to a Reuters poll. The data will be released on Thursday at 1230 GMT because Friday is a holiday in the United States.      Some market participants were betting on a higher figure after Wednesday's ADP National Employment Report showed companies hired 281,000 workers in June, well above the 200,000 forecast.      German 10-year yields, the benchmark for the euro zone, rose 1.5 basis points to 1.30 percent, extending Wednesday's rebound from near historic lows. Other euro zone bond yields were 1-3 bps higher, though traders said activity was tempered by caution ahead of the European Central Bank's monetary policy decision later in the day.      ""Clearly after yesterday's ADP report the market sold off and yields pushed higher and this persists this morning and the market is gradually expecting a stronger NFP,"" said Patrick Jacq, a bond strategist at BNP Paribas in Paris.     ""We have the ECB press conference at the same time ... so there could be more volatility in the market than a clear bias.""     The U.S. data will be released just as ECB President Mario Draghi starts his post-meeting press conference.          READING DRAGHI     The ECB is expected to hold off on further monetary stimulus measures after cutting interest rates to record lows last month and announcing 400 billion euros of new loans for banks.      Markets will be looking for details of the four-year loan scheme, which will be contingent on banks lending to companies and households rather than buying government bonds as they mostly did with similar crisis loans offered in 2011-2012.     Investors will also parse Draghi's comments to see how far back policymakers have pushed the possibility of asset purchases to support the euro zone's anaemic economic recovery.     ""If his words are interpreted by the market as suggesting that QE is further away than the market is expecting, it could have some impact,"" said Elwin de Groot, senior market economist at Rabobank.     Among peripheral euro zone bonds, Spanish yields were a touch higher as investors absorbed up to 4.5 billion euros of bonds, including new five-year paper.     While demand for the Spanish bonds was less stellar than at auctions so far this year, analysts said this signalled no weakening in investor demand for peripheral bonds which have driven their borrowing costs to record lows.     ""Certainly, the backdrop of key data, event risk in the form of U.S. labour data and the ECB policy announcement is less than conducive for a strong uptake this morning,"" Rabobank strategists said in a note.      ""As indicated by yesterday's strongly oversubscribed 10-year dollar syndication out of Portugal, though, we would not take this as any indication peripheral debt markets are beginning to lose their lustre.""      Portugal raised $4.5 billion on Wednesday in its first dollar bond sale since March 2010 as it sought to build up cash buffers to fund near-term debt repayments ahead of schedule.

73,"  * Spreadbetters see mixed open for Europe* Asia in wait-and-see mood before 1230 GMT U.S. jobs data* Strong ADP report fuels hopes for upbeat nonfarm payrolls* Focus also on ECB meeting, possible euro commentsBy Shinichi SaoshiroTOKYO, July 3 Asian stocks lingered near three-year highs on Thursday as investors waited for the U.S. nonfarm payrolls report to see if the economy is gaining momentum.Spreadbetters saw a mixed open for Europe, forecasting Britain's FTSE to open up as much as 0.1 percent higher, Germany's DAX 0.1 percent lower and France's CAX  effectively flat.Expectations rose on Wednesday after payrolls processor ADP said U.S. private-sector hiring hit a 1-1/2-year high in June.The upbeat ADP report heightened expectations that June U.S. nonfarm payrolls due at 1230 GMT would show the American economy was picking up speed after a dismal start to the year, helping boost demand for metals such as zinc and copper. Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange rose to as high as $7,145 a tonne, its highest level since late February.""People were saying, 'What is cheap in the world?' They figured out the metals were cheap and if things accelerated a little bit, why not take a position?"" said analyst Dominic Schnider of UBS Wealth Management in Singapore.Asian equity markets were little changed, with MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan  steady after inching up to briefly touch a new three-year peak.Tokyo's Nikkei flitted in and out of negative territory, although analysts expected a positive U.S. jobs data reading to make up for any modest losses. ""If the data shows that the U.S. economy is in good health, Japanese shares in the auto and technology sector will likely be bought,"" said Hikaru Sato, a senior technical analyst at Daiwa Securities in Tokyo.A Reuters poll forecast non-farm payroll gains of 212,000.     The data will be released on Thursday because U.S. markets are closed for Independence Day on Friday, the day the report is usually released.Investors are also keeping an eye on a European Central Bank meeting later on Thursday, although market participants do not expect the ECB to do much after it eased policy last month.The focus was on whether the ECB mentions quantitative easing or verbally warns against the strength of the euro, which has crawled higher against the dollar despite last month's easing. The dollar inched up 0.1 percent to 101.87 yen, helped after the benchmark U.S. Treasury yield rose to a 1-1/2 week high on the strong ADP report.The euro stood little-changed at $1.3648 after shedding 0.15 percent overnight.The Australian dollar fell 0.7 percent to $0.9382, after the central bank warned that investors were underestimating the risk of a sharp fall in the currency. It was knocked down from an eight-month peak the previous day on disappointing trade data.In commodities, crude oil extended losses after falling the previous day on encouraging signs of supply from Libya and Iraq.U.S. light crude fell 0.4 percent to $104.07 per barrel.Gold also slipped amid the possibility of bullish U.S. jobs data denting the appeal of the safe-haven metal.Spot gold fell 0.3 percent to $1,323.55 an ounce, pulling back from a 3-month high of $1,332.10 hit earlier this week as tensions in Iraq and Ukraine stoked safe-haven demand.

Expectations are for payroll growth of 225,000 in August, according to a Reuters poll.The wait for jobs data ""might have dried up the markets a bit and made it a light day,"" said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh.

87,"  WASHINGTON U.S. services industry activity slowed for a second straight month in October, the latest indication the economy has lost some momentum.Still, the economy remains on solid footing as other data on Wednesday showed a pick-up in private sector hiring last month.The Institute for Supply Management said its services index fell to 57.1 last month from a reading of 58.6 in September, drifting further from August's post-recession high of 59.6. Nevertheless, the survey showed the key services sector, which accounts for roughly two-thirds of the economy, remained solidly in growth mode. A reading above 50 indicates expansion.Another survey conducted by information services company Markit also showed services sector growth slowed last month, but stayed in expansion territory. ""The recent moderation in the surveys is broadly consistent with our view that growth cooled off between the third and fourth quarters,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan in New York.  Separately, the ADP National Employment Report showed private payrolls increased by 230,000 in October, for a record seven straight months of job gains exceeding 200,000. Private hiring had risen 225,000 in September.Job gains last month were broad-based, with mid-sized businesses adding the most workers in more than seven years. LABOR MARKET TIGHTENING ""The labor market is tightening at a rapid pace, and it looks like we will get confirmation of that on Friday,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania.The employment data helped to lift stocks. Investors were also cheered by midterm elections that put the Republican Party, considered more business friendly, in control of both houses of Congress for the first time since 2006.  The dollar was trading higher against a basket of currencies, while prices for U.S. government debt fell.The ADP figures come ahead of the Labor Department's more comprehensive nonfarm payrolls report on Friday, which includes both public and private sector employment. Payrolls are expected to have increased 231,000 last month after rising 248,000 in September, according to a Reuters survey of economists. The unemployment rate is forecast steady at a six-year low of 5.9 percent.A strengthening labor market is seen tempering some of the slowdown in growth, which is driven in part by weakening global demand, especially in China and the euro zone. Data ranging from consumer spending to trade and business spending suggest the economy exited the third quarter with less steam, setting it up for a further moderation in the final three months of the year. Construction spending has also been weak.   Third-quarter gross domestic product was initially estimated to have expanded at a 3.5 percent annual pace, but the weak trade and construction data implied growth would be lowered to around a 3 percent rate.Growth estimates for the fourth-quarter range between a 2.2 percent and 3.0 percent pace.Services sector activity last month was restrained by a sharp slowing in export orders. Measures of supplier deliveries, new orders and order backlogs also fell. A gauge of services industry employment, however, hit its highest level since August 2005.

Private employers have now added jobs for 56 straight months at an average rate of more than 186,000 per month. The report is jointly developed with Moody's Analytics.Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics, said: ""The job market is steadily picking up pace. Job growth is strong and broad-based across industries and company sizes. At this pace of job growth unemployment and underemployment is quickly declining. The job market will soon be tight enough to support a meaningful acceleration in wage growth.""The ADP figures come ahead of the U.S. Labor Department's more comprehensive nonfarm payrolls report on Friday, which includes both public and private sector employment.

Still, the Dow hit an intraday record and the S&P neared its own record, set last week. The S&P 500 energy sector rose 0.7 percent, outperforming both the broader market and crude oil, which continued to struggle. Cimarex Energy was one of the S&P 500's top gainers, up 4.3 percent at $107.32. Diamond Offshore  rose 3.1 percent to $31.29.While the sector is on track for its third consecutive daily advance - and is up 2.8 percent over that period - it remains the only industry group to be negative for 2014.""Energy is the undervalued sector of the market, but trying to call the bottom of oil prices is like trying to catch a falling knife.

A gauge of growth in the U.S. services sector rose more than expected in November even as its employment component dipped, according to ISM, while Markit's reading of the sector showed growth, though as a slower clip.Markets reacted mutedly to data showing the U.S. private sector created 208,000 jobs last month, fewer than expected. The numbers, however, suggested a slowing global economy was having a limited impact on domestic activity.Momentum is building for the ECB to launch a program of sovereign-bond buying to boost the bloc's struggling economy, with most signs pointing to March for a decision. The ECB meets on Thursday. ""We're looking for any stimulus, and are vulnerable to no additional actions being taken,"" said Quinlan, who helps oversee $330 billion in assets. ""We'll feel more confident about global prospects if we have a more proactive ECB.""The U.S. Federal Reserve's Beige Book report of anecdotal information on business activity said U.S. economic activity continued to expand in October and November, with lower gasoline prices boosting consumer spending.At 2:00 p.m. (1900 GMT), the Dow Jones industrial average  rose 16.51 points, or 0.09 percent, to 17,896.06, the S&P 500 gained 4.97 points, or 0.24 percent, to 2,071.52 and the Nasdaq Composite added 14.98 points, or 0.31 percent, to 4,770.79.Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by 2,011 to 1,009, for a 1.99-to-1 ratio; on the Nasdaq, 1,634 issues rose and 1,028 fell for a 1.59-to-1 ratio favoring advancers.The S&P 500 was posting 99 new 52-week highs and 2 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite was recording 115 new highs and 58 new lows.

Market moves were slight, with many traders looking ahead to a key meeting of the European Central Bank. Still, the Dow hit an intraday record and the S&P was within four points of its record set last week.The S&P 500 energy sector rose 1.3 percent as the top-performing sector on the day, up alongside a 0.6 percent increase in the price of crude oil. Cimarex Energy  was the S&P 500's top percentage gainer, up 5.9 percent at $108.98. Diamond Offshore rose 3.7 percent to $31.46.While the sector is on track for its third consecutive daily advance - and is up 3.3 percent over that period - the group remains the year's biggest underperformer. It is the only industry group to be negative on the year, pressured as crude has lost more than 30 percent from a recent high. ""Energy is the undervalued sector of the market, but trying to call the bottom of oil prices is like trying to catch a falling knife. There's value to be had, but also might be some more pain along the way,"" said Joseph Quinlan, chief market strategist at U.S. Trust, Bank of America Private Wealth Management in New York.A gauge of growth in the U.S. services sector rose more than expected in November even as its employment component dipped, according to ISM, while Markit's reading of the sector showed growth, though as a slower clip.Markets reacted mutedly to data showing the U.S. private sector created 208,000 jobs last month, fewer than expected. The numbers, however, suggested a slowing global economy was having a limited impact on domestic activity. Momentum is building for the ECB to launch a program of sovereign-bond buying to boost the bloc's struggling economy, with most signs pointing to March for a decision. The ECB meets on Thursday.""We're looking for any stimulus, and are vulnerable to no additional actions being taken,"" said Quinlan, who helps oversee $330 billion in assets. ""We'll feel more confident about global prospects if we have a more proactive ECB.""At 12:05 p.m. (1705 GMT) the Dow Jones industrial average  rose 8.54 points, or 0.05 percent, to 17,888.09, the S&P 500 gained 3.81 points, or 0.18 percent, to 2,070.36 and the Nasdaq Composite added 11.55 points, or 0.24 percent, to 4,767.36.Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by 2,079 to 873, for a 2.38-to-1 ratio; on the Nasdaq, 1,772 issues rose and 823 fell for a 2.15-to-1 ratio.The S&P 500 was posting 92 new 52-week highs and 2 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite was recording 103 new highs and 48 new lows.

The unemployment rate is seen holding steady at 5.8 percent, its lowest since July 2008.

Medium firms, with between 50 and 499 workers, expanded their payrolls by 65,000, down from 122,000 the previous month, which had seen the briskest hiring by that sector since February 2007.The strong pace of small-business hiring, in particular, is ""another sign of an economy that is returning to health,"" Yildirmaz said.

""The U.S. continues to be the strongest region in the globe right now, and I think markets are comforted that rates aren't going to be going up anytime soon,"" said Bob Landry, portfolio manager at USAA Investment Management Co in San Antonio, Texas.Stocks began the day in positive territory after data showed U.S. private employers added more jobs last month than expected.

Exxon Mobil Corp shares rose 1 percent to $90.72.

J.C. Penney shares surged 20.3 percent to $7.89, a day after the department store operator said same-store sales rose 3.7 percent in November and December. December same-store sales figures are due this week from more than 60 companies. The S&P retail index gained 2.1 percent. Shares of Dick's Sporting Goods Inc jumped 11.7 percent to $55.01. People familiar with the matter said the company is holding early-stage conversations with a handful of buyout firms about going private.    Housing shares were also among the day's biggest gainers, up 2.3 percent. Bloomberg reported U.S. President Barack Obama was set to announce a reduction of Federal Housing Administration mortgage insurance premiums. D.R. Horton shares rose 5.1 percent to $25.35. Biotech shares also bounced back, with the Nasdaq Biotech Index jumping 3.6 percent after falling 1.7 percent in the previous session.

104,"  * Battered euro hits fresh 9-year low* Headline inflation falls to -0.2 percent in euro zone* Core inflation data provides some respite* Fed meeting minutes, ADP numbers in focusBy Jemima KellyLONDON, Jan 7 The euro fell to a new nine-year low against the dollar on Wednesday after data showed the euro zone prices falling for the first time since 2009, piling pressure on the European Central Bank to take bold policy action. Eurozone consumer prices fell by a worse-than-expected 0.2 percent annually in December because of much cheaper energy.One measure of core inflation that ECB members have favoured in the past and excludes volatile energy and unprocessed food prices held steady at 0.7 percent in December, while another measure, which also excludes alcohol and tobacco, actually edged up to 0.8 percent. That initially provided the euro with some relief and the single currency pared losses, but it then fell again, hitting a low of $1.1823 - its weakest since January 2006 - as the dollar rallied across the board.Adam Cole, global head of FX strategy at RBC Capital Markets in London, said the euro's fall to new lows was more a result of the dollar's strength, because markets had already priced in a programme of sovereign quantitative easing in the euro zone.Cole added that investors had been prepared for the soft euro zone numbers after data on Monday had shown headline inflation in Germany - Europe's biggest economy - slowing to its lowest level in over five years in December. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar powered to a nine-year high at 92.027 ahead of minutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve's December policy meeting, due later in the day. The minutes will be scoured for any clues as to when interest rates might begin to rise.Investors will also look at ADP jobs numbers due at 1315, which are seen as a precursor to U.S. payrolls data on Friday.""Now (the euro zone data) is out the way maybe the attention shifts to more U.S. factors as opposed to the euro zone focus that's been in place over the past few days,"" said Ian Gunner, portfolio manager at the Altana Hard Currency Fund in London.After Brent crude oil fell below $50 a barrel for the first time since May 2009, oil-rich Canada's dollar hit a 5-1/2 year low at C$1.1870 against its U.S. counterpart . Oil-rich Norway's crown also skidded towards a 12-1/2-year low against the dollar.

Oil futures rallied as U.S. crude output fell for the first time in two months and the government said stockpiles grew less than some had feared. Also, Iran nuclear talks dragged on, making traders less nervous about a possible supply boost.      The ADP National Employment Report showed that U.S. private employers added 189,000 jobs last month, well below economists' expectations for 225,000 jobs.

Some had feared a bigger rise after the American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, suggested an increase of as much as 5.2 million barrels on Tuesday.      Crude prices were also supported after Iran nuclear talks missed a Tuesday deadline, relieving fears about an imminent addition of supply to the market.

139,"   By Lucia Mutikani | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON U.S. private employers hired the most workers in six months in June and factory activity picked up, providing fresh evidence the economy was gathering solid momentum after contracting at the start of the year.The brightening growth outlook was also bolstered by other data on Wednesday showing auto sales remained strong in June and construction spending rose in May to its highest level in just over 6-1/2 years. The recent raft of upbeat data supports views of a September interest rate hike from the Federal Reserve, although market-based forecasting tools suggest lift-off may not occur until late in the year or even in 2016.""The economy has shifted back into solid growth mode. A strong June jobs number would make it clear the economy can absorb a rate hike and the Fed can move at any time it wants,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania.The ADP National Employment Report showed 237,000 private-sector jobs were created in June, beating the median expectation among economists surveyed by Reuters for a gain of 218,000 jobs. Private payrolls increased 203,000 in May.June's gain marked the third straight month of improvement since the pace of hiring had slumped to a 14-month low back in March. Job increases last month were led by small businesses and the services sector. Employment in the construction industry increased 19,000 jobs, though down from the 28,000 jobs added in May. Manufacturing payrolls rose 7,000, more than recouping the 2,000 jobs lost in May.U.S. stocks ended higher on the economic data, but gains were curbed as Greece's debt crisis showed no clear sign of resolution. The dollar firmed against a basket of currencies, while prices for U.S. Treasury debt fell.The ADP report, which is jointly developed with Moody's Analytics, came ahead of the government's more comprehensive employment report on Thursday. According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased 230,000 in June after a robust 280,000 gain in May. The jobless rate was forecast dipping one-tenth of a percentage point back to a seven-year low of 5.4 percent. FACTORIES HUMMING ""The U.S. job machine remains in high gear. The current robust pace of job growth is double that needed to absorb the growth in the working-age population,"" said Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.In a separate report, the Institute for Supply Management said its national factory activity index rose to 53.5 in June, a five-month high, from a reading of 52.8 in May. It was the second straight month of gains in the index.A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the manufacturing sector. A gauge of new orders received by factories increased for a third straight month.  Eleven out of 18 industries, including furniture, fabricated metal products, computer and electronic products, and electrical equipment, appliances and components reported growth in June. Four industries, including petroleum and coal products, and primary metals, reported activity contracted.Last month's pickup in factory activity is a welcome development for the sector, which is struggling with the lingering effects of dollar strength and lower energy prices.Factory activity could get a boost from robust automobile sales. Data on Wednesday showed strong demand for sport utility vehicles and trucks in June helped General Motors Co (GM.N) and Ford Motor Co (F.N) offset slowing demand for sedans by allowing them to raise prices on their trucks. Overall auto sales slowed to a still-hefty seasonally adjusted annual rate of 17.16 million units in June from May's best-in-a-decade pace of 17.80 million units, according to Autodata Corp. June sales marked the third month in the last four to run above the 17 million units mark.     Economic reports, including employment, consumer spending,  confidence and housing, have assumed a strong note in recent months, suggesting growth was gaining steam after gross domestic product fell at a 0.2 percent annual rate at the start of 2015. The economy was hit by bad weather, port disruptions, a strong dollar and spending cuts in the energy sector in the first quarter.In a third report, the Commerce Department said construction spending increased 0.8 percent to an annual rate of $1.04 trillion in May, the highest level since October 2008.Gains were broad-based, but more pronounced in the private nonresidential segment. Economists said that should offset the drag on second-quarter growth from weak oil and gas drilling.""Construction spending looks set to add significantly to second-quarter GDP growth,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.

A poor five-year German Bobl note auction stoked selling in core European fixed-income, which spilled into the U.S. bond market, analysts said.      Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has told international lenders his government could accept their bailout offer if some terms were changed, but Germany said it could not negotiate while Greece was headed for a referendum on the aid-for-reforms deal on Sunday.      These developments soothed some jitters that Greece would leave the euro zone, which traders fear would stress worldwide financial markets.     ""Until over the weekend with the Greek referendum, the market is refocused on the economy and the Bobl auction,"" said Jonathan Rick, interest rate derivatives strategist at Credit Agricole in New York.      In early U.S. trading, benchmark 10-year Treasuries notes  were down 25/32 in price to yield 2.424 percent, up 9.1 basis points from Tuesday's close.     The 30-year bond fell 1-26/32 in price, yielding 3.200 percent up 9.5 basis points from Tuesday.

Traders will receive later Wednesday on May construction spending; June vehicle sales from car makers and June manufacturing activity from the Institute for Supply Management.       Evidence the U.S. economy is rebounding from its first-quarter slowdown will likely reinforce the view the U.S. central bank may end its near zero interest rate policy as early as September, analysts said.

The data reduced expectations for a strong jobs reading in the government's payrolls report due on Friday, and likewise reduced some expectations that the Fed would be able to raise rates as early as September.""The ADP data weighed on expectations for a Fed rate hike in September,"" said Stan Shipley, bond strategist at Evercore ISI in New York.In addition, Fed Governor Jerome Powell told CNBC that Fed policymakers had not yet decided whether to raise interest rates next month, which appeared to contradict more hawkish comments the previous day by a fellow Fed official.

In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Lockhart expressed support for the end of the Fed's near zero rate policy next month. Lockhart is a voter on the U.S. central bank's policy-setting committee this year. His reputed centrist view is seen in line with Fed Chair Janet Yellen's.""The direction of the ISM number is very encouraging for the dollar, although the number might be exaggerating the underlying strength of the U.S. economy,"" said Richard Franulovich, senior currency strategist at Westpac Banking Corp. in New York.The dollar index climbed to a 3-1/2 month peak of 98.128 in overseas trading in the wake of the Lockhart interview. It was last up 0.15 percent at 98.083. The greenback dialled back from its initial gains after Fed Governor Jerome Powell told CNBC television he has not decided on a rate 'lift-off' in September.With further jobs gains seen critical for the U.S. central bank's decision to end its near zero interest rate policy, July private hiring figures from payrolls processor ADP briefly raised doubts about the strength of the government's jobs readings due Friday, analysts said.ADP said U.S. companies hired 185,000 workers, the fewest since April. The dollar's pullback was shortlived after the Institute for Supply Management said its services sector index rose to 60.3, its highest reading since August 2005.One of the brightest aspects of the ISM report was the employment index which jumped to 59.6 last month, the highest since August 2005.The dollar hit a two-month peak against the yen at 125.015 yen on the EBS trading system before retreating to 124.925 yen, up 0.4 percent from Tuesday.The euro fell 0.2 percent at $1.08640 and touched a two-week low of $1.0847. It rose 0.3 percent to 135.680 yen .The dollar also touched a 3-1/2 month high against the Swiss franc at 0.98215 francs on the ISM services data. It added to earlier gains after Switzerland slipped deeper into deflation, raising pressure on the Swiss National Bank to act next month.

151,"   By Richard Leong | NEW YORK  NEW YORK U.S. companies hired workers at a solid clip in September, but data showed factory activity in the U.S. Midwest contracted, muddying the economic picture for the Federal Reserve on whether to raise interest rates later this year.U.S. private employers added 200,000 jobs in September, payrolls processor ADP said on Wednesday, the strongest reading since June. It beat a forecast 194,000 increase among economists polled by Reuters.Private payroll gains in August were revised down to 186,000from an originally reported 190,000 increase.The U.S. central bank's policy-setting group, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), decided against ending its near zero interest rate policy in September, citing concerns about global risks and market turbulence stemming from China.In recent days, several top Fed policy-makers including Chair Janet Yellen have said the Fed could raise rates later this year if the economy shows further improvement.""As for the FOMC reacting to this report, the market can continue to view them as the suitor wondering why it should matter when he gives the engagement ring as long as she knows they are eventually going to be married,"" Steve Blitz, chief economist at ITG in New York.Interest rates futures implied traders see a 11 percent chance the Fed would raise rates in October and a 39 percent chance it would do so in December, according to CME Group's FedWatch program. The latest ADP data supported expectations for private and government jobs gains to be reported by the U.S. Labor Department at 8:30 a.m. (1230 GMT) on Friday. Economists polled by Reuters expect Friday's report to show U.S. employers hired 203,000 workers in September, improving from August's 173,000 increase which was the smallest in five months. The unemployment rate was forecast to hold at 5.1 percent, a near 7-1/2 year low. ""If we are able to hold on this type of jobs growth, the odds are pretty good we'd be back to full employment in the summer of 2016,"" Moody's Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi told reporters on a conference call.Moody's Analytics jointly developed the private jobs report with ADP. U.S. stocks rose partly on the better-than-expected ADP data, while Treasuries prices stayed in negative territory and the dollar tacked on earlier gains. U.S. MIDWEST FACTORY SLUMP As the labor market seemed to hum along, manufacturing activity in the U.S. Midwest took an unexpected downturn as a strong dollar and weak overseas demand have hurt U.S. exports.  The Chicago Purchasing Management Index fell in September to 48.7, its weakest since May, from August's 54.4. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a reading of 53.0.A reading below 50 suggests the Chicago-area factory sector is contracting despite strong vehicle demand.A manufacturing gauge on the upper Midwest region fell to its lowest level since 2009.Marquette University and the Institute for Supply Management-Milwaukee said its regional business barometer fell to 39.44 in September from 47.67 in August.""In aggregate, growth still looks strong to keep the unemployment rate trending down,"" said Jim O'Sullivan, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, New York.

German 10-year Bund yields - the benchmark in Europe - were up 1 basis point at about 0.58 percent. The move in Portuguese yields followed news late on Tuesday that the opposition Socialists and two other left-wing parties were running out of time in talks to reach an agreement for a majority-backed coalition.Parliament will debate the new centre-right government's policy programme next Monday before a vote on Tuesday or Wednesday, which could bring down the new government if it is rejected. But the Socialist have said they would not vote it down without a viable left-wing alternative in place.Analysts say the latest political signals suggested that the political uncertainty in Portugal may soon ease a month after an inconclusive election. Investors are concerned that Lisbon's unstable political scene would block or delay vital structural reforms aimed at boosting the nascent recovery from a debt crisis.Both the centre-right and the Socialists say they plan to work under strict European Union budget rules, but the two smaller leftist parties, the Left Bloc and the Communists, have anti-austerity ideals.""Portugal is the outperformer today and press reports from there suggest the political situation is not as terrible as anticipated a few weeks ago,"" said Martin van Vliet, a senior rates strategist at ING. Nomura's euro zone economist Lefteris Farmakis said ""the most rational expectation"" was a left-wing coalition government or a minority Socialist government supported by the two small parties on the left.""I don't think yields will blow out to systemic levels if such a government comes into power,"" Farmakis said.""It will be an unstable government but there will be some sort of fiscal control as Portugal is still under enhanced surveillance by the European Commission and the Socialist party says they want to respect Portugal's international commitments.""Euro zone yields opened the day broadly lower after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi reiterated late on Tuesday that the central bank would assess the degree of monetary policy accommodation next month and remains ready and willing to act.But yields edged back up after the U.S. ADP National Employment Report showed private employers added 182,000 jobs in October, a touch above economists' expectations.

154,"  * Euro below $1.06, investors wary before ECB meets* Strong ADP data supports expectations for Dec. Fed rate hike* Dollar hits nearly two-week high against yenBy Sam ForgioneNEW YORK, Dec 2 The U.S. dollar hovered near its highest against the euro in seven and a half months on Wednesday and hit a nearly two-week high against the yen on expectations of greater monetary policy divergence between the United States and Europe.U.S. private employers added 217,000 jobs in November, above expectations and the most since June, reinforcing expectations that the Federal Reserve would hike interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade after the U.S. central bank's policy meeting on Dec. 15 and 16. The data came after a soft inflation reading from the euro zone bolstered bets that the European Central Bank would cut rates deeper into negative territory when it meets on Thursday, weighing on sentiment on the euro.Anticipated Fed rate hikes are expected to boost the dollar by driving investment flows into the United States. The divergence in monetary policy between the ECB and the Fed boosted the dollar and hurt the euro, said Boris Schlossberg, managing director at BK Asset Management in New York. ""The ADP data confirm that the labor market data in the U.S. is healthy and robust,"" Schlossberg said. ""That puts a December rate hike on track,"" he said. He also said there would be ""massive pressure"" on the ECB to expand its stimulus program.Schlossberg also said an uptick in U.S. Treasury yields  after the ADP data helped the dollar gain against the yen.The euro was last down 0.56 percent against the greenback at $1.05735, near a 7-1/2-month low of $1.05575 hit Monday. The dollar hit 123.555 yen, its highest level against the Japanese currency since Nov. 19. ""Going into the (ECB) meeting, investors are confident that the ECB will not disappoint,"" said Alvin Tan, currency strategist at Societe Generale.Investors awaited comments from Fed Chair Janet Yellen for clues on the timing of an interest rate increase. Yellen will speak before the Economic Club of Washington at 12:25 p.m. ET (1725 GMT). She also testifies on the economic outlook before a joint committee of Congress on Thursday.""Investors will also keep an eye on what Yellen has to say,"" Tan said.The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, was last up 0.55 percent at 100.340.

155,"  NEW YORK U.S. private employers added 217,000 jobs in November, above expectations and the most since June, signaling job growth is likely strong enough to support the first Federal Reserve interest rate hike in nearly a decade when policymakers meet later this month, a report by a payrolls processor showed on Wednesday.Economists surveyed by Reuters had forecast the ADP National Employment Report would show a gain of 190,000 jobs.Private payroll gains in October were revised up to 196,000from an originally reported 182,000 increase.The report is jointly developed with Moody's Analytics.   The ADP figures come ahead of the U.S. Labor Department's more comprehensive non-farm payrolls report on Friday, which includes both public and private-sector employment. Economists polled by Reuters are projecting the Labor Department's report to show U.S. employers hired 200,000 workers in November. The unemployment rate is forecast to hold at 5.0 percent. ECONUS ""The current pace of job creation is twice that needed to absorb growth in the working age population,"" Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, said in a statement. ""The economy is fast approaching full employment and will be there no later than next summer.""Employment gains were relatively healthy also across businesses when measured by size, with small employers adding 81,000 jobs, medium-sized companies adding 62,000 and large businesses adding 74,000 workers. Within the large business segment, companies with between 500 and 999 workers hired a record 57,000 people in November, according to the report. The services sector added 204,000 jobs, while goods-producing companies hired 13,000 new workers.The strength of the report contributed to a push higher in bond yields as traders positioned for an ever-more-likely rate hike by the Fed on Dec. 16. The 2-year U.S. Treasury note yield US2YT=RR, the most sensitive to Fed policy expectations, rose to a session high above 0.94 percent.

Economists surveyed by Reuters had forecast the report would show a gain of 192,000 jobs, with estimates ranging from 150,000 to 230,000.Private payroll gains in the month earlier were revised down to 211,000 from an originally reported 217,000 increase.The report is jointly developed with Moody's Analytics.""Strong job growth shows no signs of abating,"" Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody’s Analytics, said in a statement.

Goods-producing companies added 23,000 workers after shedding 2,000 jobs in the previous month.Small and large businesses showed strong gains. Employers with fewer than 50 workers hired 95,000 new people in December, while firms with 500 or more on their payrolls added 97,000.

157,"  * Vietnam operator seeking strategic partner* Singapore firm bid fails at first stage* ACV saw high demand from foreigners in IPO   (Adds comment from ADP)By Mai NguyenHANOI, Jan 20 France's Aeroports de Paris SA  has emerged as the front-runner to buy a 20 percent stake in Airports Corp of Vietnam (ACV), after an official confirmed Changi Airport International had failed at the application stage.ACV, valued at $1.2 billion, is one of Vietnam's largest state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and operates most of the country's major airports. It is offering a one-fifth stake to potential strategic partners as part of the government's partial privatisation programme.""ADP at the moment is the only eligible investor,"" Tran Thi Minh Nguyet, a senior official at ACV, told Reuters.""ACV needs approval from the Ministry of Transport to go ahead with the talks,"" Nguyet said, adding the firm had submitted a report on ADP's interest to the ministry. Paris airports operator Aeroports de Paris (ADP) said it had expressed interest in the 20 percent stake in ACV but had not yet made a firm offer.""Given that the financial, industrial and governance conditions of the sale of the 20 percent stake in ACV's capital have not been defined, this is in no way a firm offer on the part of ADP,"" an ADP spokesman said on Wednesday.ACV raised $51.6 million by selling a 3.47 percent stake at its initial public offering in December where foreigners snapped up 82 percent of the stake offer. It will lead construction of a $16 billion airport project near the southern economic hub of Ho Chi Minh City, due to start in 2018.Among the interested investors was Changi Airports International, but its application did not meet legal requirements, Nguyet said, without elaborating.Changi did not immediately comment when contacted by Reuters.Should ADP be successfully chosen this year, it would be the second foreign strategic investor in Vietnam's major SOEs after last week's sale of an 8.8 percent stake in flag carrier Vietnam Airlines to Japan's ANA Holdings valued at $108 million.The sale would be a boon to a vaunted but so far sluggish privatisation programme of hundreds of Vietnam's SOEs that has repeatedly fallen short of sales and IPO targets.

Analysts said extended declines in oil prices stoked concerns over the U.S. economy and boosted the safe-haven yen.""We know that the oil price weakness has been associated with concerns on banks, concerns on growth,"" said Steven Englander, global head of G10 foreign exchange strategy at CitiFX in New York. ""This nudges the concerns back a bit more into the picture."" The euro fell to $1.0830, its lowest level against the greenback since Feb. 1, after the ADP National Employment Report showed U.S. private employers added 214,000 jobs in February. That was above economists' expectations for a gain of 190,000, according to a Reuters poll.Analysts said the private payrolls number extended recent strength in U.S. economic data, including higher-than-expected construction spending and manufacturing data released on Tuesday. It also revived expectations of at least one U.S. Federal Reserve rate hike this year after market turmoil at the start of 2016 caused them to subside.Such expectations stand in contrast with prospects of looser policies at central banks such as the European Central Bank and Bank of Japan, a trend which is supportive of a stronger dollar. ""You've had this divergence trade reasserting itself,"" Englander said.Expectations that the ECB will announce an even more stimulative monetary policy at its March 10 meeting contributed to the euro's weakness, although the possibility that this might not happen limited the decline.""The ECB is widely expected to weaken the euro with stronger stimulus,"" said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at Western Union Business Solutions in Washington.

Economists polled by Reuters are looking for U.S. private payroll employment to have grown by 185,000 jobs in February, up from 158,000 the month before. Total non-farm employment is expected to be 190,000.The unemployment rate is forecast to stay steady at 4.9 percent, unchanged from a month earlier. While overall job conditions in the private sector showed strength last month, there were a few worrying signs, according to ADP. Manufacturers shed 9,000 jobs, which was the second biggest decline in five years, while the financial sector added 8,000 workers which were the fewest hires since August 2015.

This view of slow rate increases spurred a wave of curve steepening trades in which investors deem longer-dated Treasuries less profitable due to risk of higher inflation down the road.     Longer-dated bonds lagged shorter maturities with 30-year Treasuries, falling by more than 1 point during the session. The yield premium on 30-year bonds over five-year notes grew to 1.39 percent, the highest in a month.     ""The steepening in the curve is largely a result of the fact that Yellen sounded so immensely dovish,"" said Aaron Kohli, interest rates strategist at BMO Capital Markets in New York. ""She talked about oil, she talked about China, she kind of (downplayed) inflation a little bit even though it looks like it's heating up.""      In a speech at the Economic Club of New York on Tuesday, Yellen highlighted risks to the global economy and said the Fed should proceed ""cautiously"" as it looks to raise rates.     Yields for both two- and three-year bonds ended near one-month lows after a solid $28 billion seven-year note auction.      While shorter-dated Treasury yields posted their steepest two-day drop since September, longer-dated yields rose from their multi-week lows set on Tuesday.     Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes last traded down 3/32 in price, paring losses following the seven-year auction. The 10-year yield was last 1.825 percent, up 1 basis point on the day.     Long-end bond prices were also undercut by a report from payroll processor ADP that showed U.S. companies added a stronger-than-forecast 200,000 workers in March. The ADP report supported expectations of solid figures in the government's payrolls report due at 8:30 a.m. (1230 GMT) on Friday, fund managers said.     ""That's the next big thing on the market's radar will be the payroll number on Friday. Clearly that's been one of the strongest sectors of the economy,"" said Don Ellenberger, head of multi-sector strategies at Federated Investors in Pittsburgh.     Economists polled by Reuters projected U.S. employers likely filled 205,000 positions in March, fewer than the 242,000 in February. The jobs growth would leave the unemployment rate at an eight-year low of 4.9 percent.

Yellen's stance contrasts with recent comments from other policymakers who have voiced support for more than one increase this year.Markets around the world cheered Yellen's remarks, which suggested that a rate hike was not immediately on the horizon. The dollar fell more than a percent, while bond prices rallied.Crude oil rose more than 3 percent as reports showed less-than-expected builds in U.S. crude stockpiles last week.The rally was driven by Yellen's comments but corporate results would be the real test for stocks, said Ernie Cecilia, chief investment officer of Bryn Mawr Trust in Devon, Pennsylvania. ""In order to sustain the strength in the equity market, you're going to have to see some decent earnings growth at some point,"" he said.Declining earnings growth has been a major factor for stocks as a sputtering global economy weighs on balance sheets.Data by payrolls processor ADP on Wednesday showed the U.S. private sector added more jobs than expected in March, suggestive of a continued improvement in the U.S. labor market. The report is a precursor to the more comprehensive non-farm payrolls data on Friday.At 10:42 a.m. ET (1442 GMT), the Dow Jones industrial average was up 143.99 points, or 0.82 percent, at 17,777.1, the S&P 500 was up 16.22 points, or 0.79 percent, at 2,071.23 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 46.48 points, or 0.96 percent, at 4,893.11.Eight of the 10 major S&P sectors were higher, led by a 1.17 percent rise in the technology sector.Apple was up 2.1 percent at $109.96 after Cowen raised its rating on the stock to ""outperform"".Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 2,170 to 711.

Despite the recent string of encouraging payrolls reports, Fed Chair Yellen said on Tuesday there is still slack in the jobs market, which would allow the Fed to raise rates at a gradual pace. She also expressed concerns about global risks to U.S. expansion and the tame pace of inflation.         ""Given the risks to the outlook, I consider it appropriate for the Committee to proceed cautiously in adjusting policy,"" Yellen said.     The bond market had rallied on perceived dovish comments from Yellen, sending yields to multi-week lows on Tuesday.     In early Wednesday trading, benchmark 10-year Treasury notes  were down 10/32 in price for a yield of 1.847 percent, up 3.5 basis points from late on Tuesday. The 10-year yield hit a four-week low of 1.800 percent on Tuesday.     On Wall Street, the Standard & Poor's 500 index was up 0.7 percent.      The drop in Treasury prices should bolster demand for the latest seven-year note supply at 1 p.m. (1700 GMT). The two-year and five-year Treasury auctions held earlier this week fetched mediocre demand.     In ""when-issued"" activity, traders expected the latest seven-year issue to sell at a yield of 1.6280 percent , compared with the 1.568 percent at the prior auction in February.

172,"   By Richard Leong | NEW YORK  NEW YORK The dollar rose on Wednesday, rebounding from recent lows against the yen and euro as data on U.S. trade and factory orders eased some worries about the sub-1 percent growth path the world's biggest economy was stuck on in the first quarter.But a surprisingly weak report on private U.S. jobs growth in April and bets the Bank of Japan might not intervene soon to stem the yen's rise could help rekindle further losses on the greenback, analysts said.The greenback sagged to a near 19-month low of 105.52 yen overnight JPY= and touched its weakest against the euro since last August at $1.1614 EUR= on Tuesday.""We will see more momentum on the dollar downtrend unless there's a major upward surprise on Friday,"" said Ray Uy, head of macro research at Invesco in Atlanta, referring to the government's April payrolls report due later this week.For now, the dollar has stabilized from its recent decline after the U.S. trade gap shrank to its smallest in 13 months in March and factory orders grew 1.1 percent, more than analyst forecasts. Moreover, the Institute for Supply Management's gauge on the  U.S. services industry rose to its highest since December.Those figures overshadowed news from payroll processor ADP that companies added 156,000 workers in April, the smallest  monthly gain in three years.The dollar index .DXY which measures the greenback's value against the euro, yen and four other currencies, was up 0.3 percent at 93.205, rebounding from its lowest in more than 15 months on Tuesday.

Position squaring ahead of U.S. jobs data due at 8:30 a.m. EDT (1230 GMT) on Friday likely supported the dollar against the yen for now, but it will not be enough to reverse the trend, analysts said.""There's no incentive to long dollar/yen,"" said Jeremy Cook, head of currency strategy at World First in London.In the futures market, speculators held $7.5 billion in bets on the dollar falling versus the yen, the second most net dollar/yen shorts going back to August 2012, according to Reuters calculations and data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission released last Friday.

Despite the marked slowdown in April hiring, Zandi said on a conference call following the report that he does not believe underlying U.S. job growth is materially different from its recent trend. Other labor market indicators, such as the weekly report on initial claims for unemployment benefits, are not consistent with a slowdown in job creation, he said.Small businesses showed the largest gains on the month, with employers with fewer than 50 employees adding 93,000 workers. Meanwhile, medium-sized businesses with between 50 and 499 workers expanded their payrolls by 39,000 and large companies adding just 24,000.

On Tuesday, the index hit a six-week low but was flat so far this week. Data on Wednesday from payrolls processor ADP showing the U.S. private sector added 179,000 jobs in July suggested that the labor market continues to improve. But the data did not significantly alter expectations that the Fed will hold off raising interest rates until next year. Friday's release of the government's July jobs report will provide a broader picture of the labor market.Fed funds futures late Wednesday saw an 18 percent chance the Fed will increase rates when it meets next month, up from 12 percent Tuesday, according to the CME's FedWatch. For the December meeting, the probability of a Fed hike rose to 42.7 percent from 38 percent on Tuesday.  Analysts have said the Fed has not raised rates unless market participants have priced in at least a 60 percent chance in the month before it is expected to do so.Christopher Vecchio, currency analyst at DailyFX, said the recent U.S. employment numbers have been consistent with expectations that the Fed will raise rates.  ""But with only two non-farm payrolls reports before the Fed meets in September, the (numbers) will have to be extraordinarily strong for the Fed to even consider raising rates,"" he added.Market participants are also looking ahead to Thursday's  Bank of England monetary policy decision, more than a month after Britain voted to leave the European Union.

The dollar is down about 0.7 percent for the week against the yen, which prompted a verbal warning from Japan's top currency diplomat on Wednesday.""Current levels of the yen are very concerning, given the lack of action from the BOJ last week.

Yields on benchmark notes, which move inversely to prices, have risen nearly 11 basis points in August, the biggest increase since June 2015.     On two-year Treasury notes, yields saw their biggest monthly gain since December as the data and comments from a chorus of Federal Reserve officials that rate hikes look appropriate before year-end have increased expectations for higher short-term interest rates.     Two-year yields have risen nearly 13 basis points this month.     On Wednesday, analysts said traders were holding firm with their eyes toward Friday's U.S. non-farm payrolls report, which could indicate what action the Fed is likely to take at its upcoming meeting on Sept. 20-21.      ADP's national employment report showed the U.S. added 177,000 private sector jobs in August, slightly more than the 175,000 economists surveyed by Reuters had expected.       Yields slipped slightly, in a move analysts said was likely due to buying from overseas investors.     Central bank easing, combined with increased global demand for U.S. government debt, which continues to offer higher yield than most developed market competitors, have offset selling pressures from increased inflation expectations to keep Treasury market moves muted ahead of Friday's data, said Ira Jersey, senior client portfolio manager at OppenheimerFunds.      The Bank of England recently announced it was increasing bond buying in its quantitative easing program and both the Bank of Japan and European Central Bank are in the midst of QE programs of their own.     Jersey also highlighted sharp drops in Treasury yields in June, when yields fell 34 basis points, as being partially responsible for the August increase in yields.     On Wednesday, benchmark 10-year Treasury notes  rose 3/32 in price from their Tuesday close to yield 1.56 percent. Two year prices rose 1/32, yielding 0.79 percent.     ""The irony is, even at 1.5 percent, this unprecedentedly low yield is still high vis-à-vis other developed markets,"" Jersey said. ""So there's still demand for Treasuries from overseas.""

188,"   By Karen Brettell | NEW YORK  NEW YORK The U.S. dollar fell from three-week highs against a basket of currencies on Wednesday after weak manufacturing data dented some optimism about U.S. economic growth ahead of a highly anticipated jobs report on Friday.Hawkish comments by Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen and Vice Chair Stanley Fischer last week increased expectations the U.S. central bank is moving closer to an interest rate hike.Fischer has said that jobs data for August due on Friday will be a consideration for when the Fed raises rates. Employers are expected to have added 180,000 jobs in August, according to the median estimate of 89 economists polled by Reuters. [ECONUS]The greenback rose to session highs after the ADP National Employment Report on Wednesday showed U.S. private employers adding 177,000 jobs in August, slightly above the 175,000 forecast by a Reuters survey of economists.Private payroll gains in July were revised up to 194,000 from 179,000. “The upward revision was encouraging, for ... August it was pretty close to expectations,” said Richard Franulovich, a senior currency strategist at Westpac Banking Corporation in New York.The dollar fell from the day's highs, however, after the Institute for Supply Management-Chicago said its business barometer fell 4.3 points to 51.5 in August, below expectations.The manufacturing sector is lagging gains in the economy as factories continue to process the lingering effects of the dollar's past rally and oil price collapse. An update on Chinese factory activity will also be in focus later on Wednesday.The dollar index, which measures the currency against a basket of six majors, rose as high as to 96.255 .DXY, its highest since Aug. 9, before falling back to 96.005, marginally down on the day.The greenback gained against the yen to 103.39 yen JPY=, after hitting 103.53, its highest since July 29. The dollar also hit three-week highs against the euro after data on Wednesday showed euro zone inflation was stable in August, contrary to expectations of a slight rise and piling more pressure on the European Central Bank to act.The euro EUR= weakened to $1.1121, the lowest since Aug. 10, before recovering to $1.1152.Most investors do not expect further policy measures when the ECB’s rate-setting Governing Council meets next week, though Westpac’s Franulovich noted that the recent string of weak data has increased speculation that further easing could be possible.

A payrolls processor showed U.S. private employers added 177,000 jobs in August, above economists' forecasts and supporting expectations for Friday's closely watched U.S. payrolls report to be strong.      An upbeat payrolls report would support the view that further U.S. rate hikes may be on the cards, after Fed officials sounded a hawkish note at a meeting last weekend.      Spot gold fell to $1,304.91 an ounce, its lowest since June 24, the day after Britain voted to leave the European Union. It was down 0.2 percent at $1,308.01 an ounce by 2:47 p.m. EDT (1847 GMT) after the dollar turned slightly lower.     The metal is heading for a 3.2 percent drop in August. U.S. gold futures settled down 0.4 percent at $1,311.40.     ""If you looked at the last three or four days, you're pricing in higher odds of a Fed rate increase. Odds are for December and it seems like the market is getting behind that,"" said Rob Haworth, senior investment strategist for U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Seattle.     Gold is highly sensitive to rising U.S. interest rates, which increase the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion.      Fed Chair Janet Yellen said on Friday the case for higher rates was strengthening, while Vice Chair Stanley Fischer later suggested an increase could come as soon as September.        On Wednesday, Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren said the Fed should consider that quicker interest rate rises over time could stave off risks to the economy, while Chicago Fed President Charles Evans said he is increasingly convinced that U.S. economic growth has slowed permanently.        Technical selling, earlier strength in the U.S. dollar and rate hike speculation have been behind gold's weakness, Commerzbank analyst Carsten Fritsch said, adding that it was nearing the psychologically key $1,300 level.     ""Nerves have become a bit fraught ahead of the September FOMC meeting, given the latest comments from Janet Yellen,"" Saxo Bank's head of commodities research Ole Hansen said. ""The rising dollar and U.S. real rates have also been creating headwinds.     Silver was up 0.4 percent at $18.65 an ounce.

190,"  * Yields little moved on Wednesday after in-line ADP report     * Yields on 10-year on pace for most monthly gain since June 2015     * Two-year notes on pace for biggest gain since November     * Solid U.S. data, rate hike expectations hurt Treasury prices      By Dion Rabouin     NEW YORK, Aug 31 Yields on benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury notes were little moved on Wednesday but on track for their largest monthly gain in more than a year as strong U.S. data has limited volatility and investors have taken profits from after declining yields in June and July.     Yields on benchmark notes, which move inversely to prices, have risen 10 basis points in August, the biggest increase since June 2015.      On two-year Treasury notes, yields were headed toward their biggest monthly gain since November as the data and comments from a chorus of Federal Reserve officials that rate hikes look appropriate before year-end has increased expectations for short-term interest rates to rise.     Two-year yields have risen nearly 12 basis points this month.     On Wednesday, analysts said traders were holding firm with their eyes toward Friday's U.S. non-farm payrolls report, which could indicate what action the Fed is likely to take at its upcoming meeting on Sept. 20-21.     ADP's national employment report showed the U.S. added 177,000 private sector jobs in August, slightly more than the 175,000 economists surveyed by Reuters had expected.       Yields slipped slightly, in a move analysts said was likely due to buying from overseas buyers.     Central bank easing, combined with increased global demand for U.S. government debt, which continues to offer higher yield than most developed market competitors, have offset selling pressures from increased inflation expectations to keep Treasury market moves muted ahead of Friday's data, said Ira Jersey, senior client portfolio manager at OppenheimerFunds.      The Bank of England recently announced it was increasing bond buying in its quantitative easing program and both the Bank of Japan and European Central Bank are in the midst of QE programs of their own.     Jersey also highlighted comments from BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda who said over the weekend that the central bank had ""ample space"" for more monetary policy easing.     Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes rose 2/32 in price from their Tuesday close to yield 1.56 percent. Two year  prices rose 1/32, yielding 0.77 percent.     ""The irony is, even at 1.5 percent, this unprecedentedly low yield is still high vis-à-vis other developed markets,"" Jersey said. ""So there's still demand for Treasuries from overseas.""     Japanese 10-year government bonds yield -0.068 percent, German 10-year Bunds offer -0.086 percent yield and British government debt currently yields 0.614 percent.

191,"  (Adds dropped word ""high"" in headline)* ADP jobs data in line with expectations* Chicago PMI falls, misses expectations* Weak euro zone inflation adds pressure for more ECB actionBy Karen BrettellNEW YORK, Aug 31 The U.S. dollar rose to three-week highs against a basket of currencies on Wednesday after data showed that jobs gains in August were roughly in line with expectations, before paring gains on weak manufacturing data.Hawkish comments by Fed Chair Janet Yellen and Vice Chair Stanley Fischer last week increased expectations the U.S. central bank is moving closer to an interest rate hike. Fischer has said that jobs data for August due on Friday will be a consideration on when the Fed raises rates. Employers are expected to have added 180,000 jobs in August, according to the median estimate of 89 economists polled by Reuters.The greenback rose to session highs after the ADP National Employment Report on Wednesday showed U.S. private employers adding 177,000 jobs in August, slightly above the 175,000 forecast by a Reuters survey of economists.Private payroll gains in July were revised up to 194,000 from 179,000. ""The upward revision was encouraging, for the actual month of August it was pretty close to expectations,"" said Richard Franulovich, a senior currency strategist at Westpac Banking Corporation in New York.""For the time being the narrative is pretty dollar bullish,"" Franulovich said.The dollar pared gains, however, after the Chicago PMI index fell in August, and missed economists expectations. The dollar index, which measures the currency against a basket of six majors, rose as high as to 96.255, its highest level since Aug. 9, before falling back to 96.066.The greenback gained against the yen to 103.31, after earlier hitting 103.53, the highest level since July 29.The dollar also hit three-week highs against the euro, after data on Wednesday showed that euro zone inflation was stable in August, against expectations of a slight rise, piling more pressure on the European Central Bank to act.The euro weakened to $1.1121, the lowest since Aug. 10, before recovering back to $1.1143.The ECB has been buying 80 billion euros ($89.2 billion) worth of assets a month to pump money into the economy. Interest rates have been cut below zero and free loans offered to banks.Most investors do not expect further policy measures when the ECB's rate-setting Governing Council meets next week, though Westpac's Franulovich noted that the recent string of weak data has increased speculation that a further easing could be possible.

Investors are awaiting U.S. non-farm payroll data this week for further clues on the timing of a U.S. rate hike after Fed officials sounded a hawkish note at a meeting last weekend.      Spot gold was $1,314.16 an ounce at 0932 GMT, up 0.3 percent, having slipped 1 percent in the previous session to touch a two-month low of $1,308.65. The metal is heading for a 2.8 percent drop in August.     U.S. gold futures were up $1 at $1,317.50.     Fed Chair Janet Yellen said on Friday the case for higher rates was strengthening, while Vice Chair Stanley Fischer later suggested a hike could come as soon as September. Fischer added in an interview on Tuesday that the U.S. job market is nearly at full strength.       ""Nerves have become a bit fraught ahead of the September FOMC meeting given the latest comments from Janet Yellen,"" Saxo Bank's head of commodities research Ole Hansen said. ""The rising dollar and U.S. real rates have also been creating headwinds.""     ""But it all seems to be going in slow motion. We have seen no panic from either exchange-traded product investors, where holdings are up on the month, while hedge funds have only reduced net longs by 8 percent from the July peak.""     Holdings of the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, New York-listed SPDR Gold Shares, are down 2.7 tonnes in August, compared with an inflow of 8 tonnes in July.       Gold is highly sensitive to rising U.S. interest rates, which increase the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion, while boosting the dollar, in which it is priced.      The pace of rate hikes is heavily dependent on U.S. economic data. Friday's non-farm report for August, a closely watched barometer of the jobs market, could reinforce hawkish messages from Fed officials.     Ahead of that, ADP employment data, which tracks private payrolls, and the Chicago purchasing managers' index (PMI) are due later on Wednesday.     ""Private payroll data out of the U.S. will help to give the market some direction,"" MKS said in a note. ""However, it's unlikely we will see gold move outside of $1,300.""     The dollar index eased 0.1 percent on Wednesday.      Silver was up 1 percent at $18.75 an ounce.      Platinum was up 0.7 percent at $1,059.60, having touched an eight-week low of $1,048 on Tuesday.

The Institute of Supply Management (ISM) said on Wednesday that U.S. services sector activity rebounded to an 11-month high in September, while its employment index was also the highest since October 2015.      It came after the ADP National Employment Report data missed economists' expectations, showing that U.S. private employers added 154,000 jobs in September.      ""ISM spurred more thoughts about the possibility of non-farm payrolls being much better than ADP,"" said Jim Vogel, an interest rate strategist at FTN Financial in Memphis, Tennessee.     Friday's employment report is expected to show 175,000 jobs were added in the month, according to the median estimate of 100 economists polled by Reuters.     Investors will also focus on whether August's weaker-than-expected gain of 151,000 jobs will be revised upward.     Benchmark 10-year notes fell 11/32 in price to yield 1.72 percent, up from 1.68 percent late on Tuesday. The yields have climbed from a low of 1.53 percent on Friday.     Demand for safe haven bonds has fallen since Friday, when concerns about the stability of Deutsche Bank eased.     ""Sentiment has been bad since it became clear that there wasn't going to be any immediate further concerns about Deutsche,"" Vogel said. ""There was pent-up selling that wasn't executed when we were watching that situation that got unleashed on Friday afternoon.""     Investors are also focused on an Oct. 14 speech by Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen at a Boston Fed economics conference for any new signals of when the U.S. central bank is likely to next raise interest rates.     It may be Yellen's last chance to indicate whether a rate hike is likely at the Fed's policy meeting in early November.     Traders are pricing in a 17 percent chance that the Fed will raise rates in November and a 64 percent chance of an increase in December, according to CME Group's FedWatch program.

196,"   By Lindsay Dunsmuir | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON U.S. services sector activity rebounded to an 11-month high in September, an encouraging sign for economic growth that may increase the prospect of a Federal Reserve interest rate hike this year.The Institute of Supply Management (ISM) said on Wednesday its non-manufacturing activity index surged to a reading of 57.1, the highest level since October 2015. Last month's reading followed a disappointing drop in August.Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index rising to 53.0. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity.""These data help the case for the Fed tightening again before too long,"" said Jim O'Sullivan, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, New York.Improvement in the index was broad-based with business activity and the employment sub-indices reaching 11-month highs. It followed similarly upbeat news on Monday when ISM reported U.S. factory activity shrugged off weakness in August..The dollar strengthened against a basket of currencies following the data on Wednesday. U.S. stocks were trading higher, while prices of U.S. Treasuries were largely weaker. In a separate report, the U.S. Commerce Department said new orders for manufactured goods rose 0.2 percent in August, a second straight monthly increase following two months of weakness.Economists had expected factory orders to rise 0.1 percent.Core capital goods, seen as a measure of business confidence and spending plans, increased 0.9 percent.  The Atlanta Fed left its forecast for third-quarter GDP growth unchanged at a 2.2 percent annual rate after the data. The U.S. central bank has indicated its baseline case is for a rate increase at the December policy meeting as long as the economy continues to strengthen. It grew a lackluster 1.0 percent during the first half of the year.The Fed raised rates in December 2015, the first such move in nearly a decade, but has held them steady so far this year. EYES ON PAYROLLS Another report on Wednesday by a leading payrolls processor showed U.S. private employers added 154,000 jobs in September, slightly below economists' expectations. The more closely-watched monthly U.S. jobs report is scheduled for release on Friday.The Commerce Department also reported earlier on Wednesday that the U.S. trade deficit rose more than expected in August as a jump in imports offset higher exports. The trade gap widened 3 percent to $40.73 billion.Imports hit their highest level since September 2015 while exports were the highest since July of last year.However, economists said the large gain in imports was partly due to a rise in intellectual property payments tied to  broadcasting rights for the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.
