0,"  Feb 12 (The following statement was released by the rating agency)Fitch Ratings has affirmed the ratings of Cardinal  Health, Inc. (Cardinal), including the long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR), at  'BBB+'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.The ratings apply to approximately $3.9 billion of debt at Dec. 31, 2013. A full  list of rating actions follows at the end of this release.KEY RATING DRIVERS -- The oligopolistic nature of the U.S. drug distribution industry and steady  pharmaceutical demand contribute to exceptionally stable operating profiles for  Cardinal and its peers, excluding recent contract switches. Drug distribution,  though low margin, is relatively insulated from pricing and regulatory pressures  faced by other areas of healthcare in the U.S.-- Margins and cash flows continue to benefit from the mostly durable effects of  the generic wave, which is set to ramp up again in calendar 2014-2015.  Cardinal's joint venture (JV) with CVS Caremark Corp. (CVS) and the anticipated  introduction of biosimilar drugs to the U.S. drug channel should further support  margins beginning in 2015-2016.-- Overall industry trends, including brand-to-generic conversions, favorable  drug pricing, and base business growth, are offsetting the Fitch-estimated $230  million of lost EBITDA from expired contracts with Express Scripts, Inc. (ESRX)  and Walgreen Co. (Walgreens). Fitch projects modestly higher EBITDA in fiscal  2014 and 2015 compared to 2013, despite the loss of about $30 billion in annual  sales.-- Cardinal's material underrepresentation in the specialty drug distribution  space relative to its peers could hinder intermediate-term growth and  profitability. The acquisition of AssuraMed and Cardinal's plans for growing its  Medical business present compelling growth opportunities and could offset this  concern somewhat, but could also introduce new forms of operating risk (e.g.  product liability) depending on the strategies pursued.-- Fitch expects Cardinal to generate cash sufficient to fund operations,  shareholder payouts, targeted M&A, and debt service. Solid liquidity is  supported by relatively large available cash balances, and only $500 million of  debt is due before October 2016.RATING SENSITIVITIES Maintenance of a 'BBB+' IDR will require debt leverage generally maintained  below 1.7x, accompanied by continued robust cash flows and stable or growing  margins over the ratings horizon (excluding the impact of the lost Walgreens  contract). Liquidity should be adequate to fund targeted M&A that bolsters the  firm's intermediate-term growth outlook; but there is currently limited room for  additional long-term debt at the 'BBB+' ratings.An upgrade to 'A-' is not anticipated in the intermediate term. Upward ratings  migration could result from a demonstration of and commitment to operating with  debt leverage below 1.2x-1.3x, combined with responsible M&A activity that  contributes to an overall improved intermediate-term growth outlook. A sustained  commitment to Cardinal's core distribution business will also be necessary to  support the consideration of an upgrade.A downgrade to 'BBB' could result from a leveraging transaction that causes debt  leverage to increase to above 1.7x for materially more than 12-18 months.  Debt-funded shareholder-friendly activities could also precipitate a negative  rating action. The development of a material competitive gap between Cardinal  and its peers, possibly arising from the firm's lagging position in specialty  distribution, could also pressure ratings. MODESTLY GROWING EBITDA DESPITE SIGNIFICANT CONTRACT LOSSES The Fitch-estimated $200 million-$250 million in EBITDA associated with the lost  Walgreen Co. (Walgreens) and Express Scripts, Inc. (ESRX) contracts is being  offset by the effects of generic conversions, favorable drug pricing, and the  addition of AssuraMed. Another wave of generic conversions is now accelerating  and will support margins over the next couple years. Fitch forecasts modestly  growing EBITDA and relatively steady credit metrics for Cardinal in fiscal  2014-2015 compared to 2013. Notably, Cardinal's peers are experiencing similar  margin support from industry trends without significant volume declines.Despite the very low-margin nature of the aforementioned contracts and the now  decreased customer concentration, the removal of such a large amount of drug  volumes is a moderate credit negative. Cardinal will no longer benefit from the  operating stability and superior growth prospects generally associated with  these drug channel participants. Furthermore, the removal of such a large amount  of volumes will lessen Cardinal's ability to leverage the largely fixed cost  structure inherent in drug distribution.Fitch believes Cardinal has adjusted appropriately thus far and will continue to  review and optimize its cost structure as it annualizes the Walgreens contract  expiration so as to limit the credit impact of these developments.INTERMEDIATE-TERM GROWTH CONCERNS; OFFSET SOMEWHAT BY MEDICAL STRATEGY Fitch remains concerned about Cardinal's intermediate-term growth profile,  primarily due to the company's significant under-representation in specialty  drug distribution. Cardinal's lagging position in this important growth market  could become more glaring after the bulk of the generic wave has washed through  the channel and biosimilars begin to gain market acceptance in 2016 and beyond.  Fitch is not convinced that Cardinal's current strategy will take a significant  share of the specialty distribution market over the ratings horizon. Fitch estimates AmerisourceBergen Corp. (ABC), McKesson Corp. (McKesson), and Cardinal control approximately 55%, 25%, and 5% of the specialty drug  distribution (primarily to care providers) market in the U.S., respectively.Cardinal's 2013 acquisition of AssuraMed does provide a profitable growth  platform for the firm; but it does not fully address Fitch's concerns.Especially since losing its contract with Walgreens, Cardinal has focused more  of its public comments on its strategy to grow its Medical business. Fitch  generally views this shift in strategy as appropriate and expects both internal  and external investment to support solid Medical segment growth over time.On balance, Fitch thinks Cardinal will pursue these opportunities responsibly  and that most transactions will be funded with cash on hand. Success in this  area could alleviate Fitch's intermediate-term growth concerns over time. Fitch  views certain tenets of Cardinal's outlined strategy for growing its Medical  segment cautiously though, depending on the pacing thereof. Specifically, Fitch  is wary of new types of business risk that could accompany potential acquisition  targets (i.e. product liability with manufacturing).JV WITH CVS TO DRIVE COST SAVINGS; DIFFERENTIATED FROM PEERS The 10-year joint venture Cardinal announced with CVS Caremark Corp. (CVS) in  December 2013 should provide both firms with cost savings, ramping up over the  course of calendar 2015 and beyond. Cardinal also disclosed that it had extended  its distribution contract with CVS through 2019. Fitch thinks future  collaborative agreements between the two firms are possible, though the current  relationship is strictly for the procurement of generic drugs, excluding  injectables. Notably, CVS' Caremark PBM business is served under a contract with  McKesson that was just renewed in April 2013. The CVS/Cardinal JV will become the largest purchaser of generic drugs in the  U.S., and the second-largest in the world. The JV is similar in principle to the  other scale-aggregating deals executed over the last 12 months, though it lacks  the equity ownership components of the other two. Fitch expects the benefits of  increased scale to be recognized more or less in proportion to the purchasing  power of each entity over the course of the next few years. The longer-term  implications of the various degrees of business integration are at this time  difficult to measure and predict.GOOD LIQUIDITY, CASH FLOWS; MANAGEABLE DEBT MATURITIES Fitch expects Cardinal's liquidity to remain strong over the ratings horizon,  bolstered in the near term by a significant cash inflow from working capital  associated with the expired WAG contract. Cash flows will remain robust, with  annual free cash flow (FCF) forecasted to exceed $1 billion in the forecast  period. Fitch thinks the firm will generate sufficient cash to sufficiently fund  operations and internal investment, to fulfill its public commitment to  shareholder payouts, and to consummate small-to-medium sized M&A that  strengthens intermediate-term growth prospects.Debt maturities are manageable, with only $500 million of debt coming due before  October 2016. Fitch estimates debt maturities as follows: $500 million in fiscal  2015; $770 million in 2017; $560 million in 2018; and $1.78 billion thereafter.  Fitch expects debt to be refinanced as it comes due over the ratings horizon.Fitch has affirmed Cardinal's ratings as follows:-- Long-term IDR at 'BBB+';-- Senior unsecured bank facility at 'BBB+';-- Senior unsecured notes at 'BBB+';-- Short-term IDR at 'F2';-- Commercial paper at 'F2'.Fitch has also assigned a long-term IDR of 'BBB+' to Allegiance Corp., an issuer  subsidiary of Cardinal.The Rating Outlook is Stable.",2014-02-12,CAH,"Wed Feb 12, 2014 | 9:06am EST",RPT-Fitch Affirms Cardinal Health at 'BBB+'; Outlook Stable,http://www.reuters.com//article/fitch-affirms-cardinal-health-at-bbb-out-idUSFit69047420140212?type=companyNews

6,"  Stanford’s shot at the new college football playoff took a big hit last week with a loss to Southern Cal, but the Cardinal remain a dangerous team. Stanford will try to bounce back from that tight loss when it hosts Army on Saturday. The Cardinal have not lost back-to-back games since 2009 and are taking on a Black Knights team under the guidance of first-year coach Jeff Monken, who added a touch more passing to the triple-option offense.Stanford recovered from losses to win the Pac-12 in each of the past two seasons and believes it is capable of the same in 2014. “The charge is to our guys, our coaches and players, to be better,” coach David Shaw told reporters after the loss to USC. “Not to scrap what we’ve done, not at all, but to be better than we were (against the Trojans).” Stanford struggled in the red zone in the loss and gave up 156 yards rushing, something the team will need to focus on against Army.TV: 5 p.m. ET, Pac-12 Network. LINE: Stanford -28 ABOUT ARMY (1-0): The Black Knights used their running game to keep the Buffalo offense off the field in a 47-39 opening win and ended up with 341 yards on the ground. Always one of the better rushing teams in the nation, Army under Monken is picking its spots to throw the ball and Angel Santiago completed all six of his attempts against the Bulls to keep drives alive. “We can’t masquerade what we’re trying to do very much,” Monken told reporters. “We want to run the football. They know that, we know that, and if we hope to have any success we’re going to have to be able to run the ball successfully.”ABOUT STANFORD (1-1): The Cardinal did better than most at controlling the triple option when the teams met last season, holding the Black Knights to 284 yards rushing in a 34-20 road win. Stanford outgained USC 413-291 but turned the ball over twice in a scoreless second half and missed a pair of field goals in the 13-10 setback. Quarterback Kevin Hogan, who threw three scoring passes at Army last season, was the bright spot for the offense against the Trojans, going 22-for-30 for 285 yards. EXTRA POINTS 1. Stanford has not lost consecutive games since 2009. 2. Army RB Larry Dixon led the team with 174 yards on 20 attempts against Buffalo.3. The Cardinal have recorded at least one sack in 35 of the last 36 games, with the 2013 matchup against the Black Knights the exception.PREDICTION: Stanford 41, Army 20",2014-09-13,CAH,"Sat Sep 13, 2014 | 7:02am EDT",Preview: Army at Stanford,http://www.reuters.com//article/fbc-army-stanford-preview-idUSMTZEA9DU6NGQA20140913?type=companyNews

10,"   By Caroline Humer | NEW YORK  NEW YORK U.S. pharmaceutical and medical equipment maker Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) said on Monday it agreed to sell its Cordis vascular technology unit to Cardinal Health (CAH.N) for $1.9 billion, completing its exit from the cardiovascular stent business.Cardinal, one of the largest U.S. drug distribution companies, is expanding its medical equipment offerings for physicians.""While this transaction is not without obvious risks and does mark a change in CAH's overall business mix/business model, we believe the financial attractiveness outweighs this fact,"" Evercore ISI analyst Ross Muken said in a research note.  Cardinal, which expects the deal to close by the end of calendar year 2015, said the acquisition will be slightly dilutive to earnings in the fiscal year ending June 2016. It expects the deal to then boost earnings by 20 cents per share in the fiscal year ending June 30, 2017, and it sees cost savings of $100 million by the end of fiscal 2018. Cardinal's chief executive, George Barrett, said the company may make more acquisitions in cardiology and endovascular treatment as well as in the trauma and wound care segment. ""Those are areas where we could see opportunities to fill out the portfolio,"" Barrett said in an interview. Shares of Cardinal rose 1.4 percent, or $1.24, to $89.23, in early afternoon trading, while J&J rose 0.6 percent, or 64 cents, to $103.15. J&J, which makes pharmaceuticals, medical equipment and consumer items, said it will still own its electrophysiology business and the drug Xarelto in the cardiovascular segment. It exited the highly competitive drug-coated stent market four years ago because it was not a top player and faced competition from Medtronic Plc (MDT.N), Abbott Laboratories (ABT.N), St Jude Medical Inc (STJ.N) and Boston Scientific Corp (BSX.N). Cordis gets about 70 percent of its revenue from outside the United States, and its principal markets include Europe, China, and Japan. The Cordis business includes wires and guides and other equipment used in cardiology and endovascular procedures. The latter includes products to treat aneurysms and to open up arteries such as in the abdominal aorta.Cardinal was advised by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz and Jones Day and by Goldman Sachs Group (GS.N).

It expects the deal to then boost earnings by 20 cents per share in the fiscal year ending June 30, 2017, and it sees cost savings of $100 million by the end of fiscal 2018.Cardinal's chief executive, George Barrett, said the company may make more acquisitions in cardiology and endovascular treatment as well as in the trauma and wound care segment.""Those are areas where we could see opportunities to fill out the portfolio,"" Barrett said in an interview. Shares of Cardinal rose 1.4 percent, or $1.24, to $89.23, in early afternoon trading, while J&J rose 0.6 percent, or 64 cents, to $103.15.J&J, which makes pharmaceuticals, medical equipment and consumer items, said it will still own its electrophysiology business and the drug Xarelto in the cardiovascular segment. It exited the highly competitive drug-coated stent market four years ago because it was not a top player and faced competition from Medtronic Plc, Abbott Laboratories , St Jude Medical Inc and Boston Scientific Corp .Cordis gets about 70 percent of its revenue from outside the United States, and its principal markets include Europe, China, and Japan.The Cordis business includes wires and guides and other equipment used in cardiology and endovascular procedures. The latter includes products to treat aneurysms and to open up arteries such as in the abdominal aorta.Cardinal was advised by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz and Jones Day and by Goldman Sachs Group. J&J was advised by Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP and Baker & McKenzie LLP and JP Morgan Chase.

13,"   By Edward McAllister   (This March 29 story corrects to show that sales tax fell for third time since 2010, instead of second time, in first and third paragraphs; and adds graphic)By Edward McAllisterNEW YORK Sales tax receipts in the thriving oil town of Midland, Texas, fell this month, only the third decline in five years and one of the first signs of how low oil prices are beginning to ripple beyond oil company bottom lines and into the wider economy.Midland's sales tax revenues, which reflect commercial and residential spending, dipped to $5.119 million in March from $5.126 million in March 2014, according to data from the Texas Comptroller released last week. The fall was slight, but it was just the third year-over-year decline since April 2010, when an oil production boom was just beginning to transform Midland. It also marks a stark and potentially protracted turnaround from recent years: last year in March, when oil prices soared above $100 a barrel, sales tax receipts increased 11 percent. ""These numbers are more significant to me than anything else,"" said Karr Ingham, an economist who compiles the Texas PetroIndex, an annual analysis of the state's energy economy.""There is no doubt that local spending is going to suffer, and we are just seeing the beginning of this,"" said Ingham, who expects an economic downturn to last for months and potentially years, even after oil prices rebound. Midland has a population of around 140,000, and an economic decline there alone should not seriously dent the state economy. However, the town has become a potent symbol of the oil boom, and its economy could shed light on the potential future impact for Texas and other oil producing regions across the country.Moreover, the fact that the first cracks in the Midland economy are appearing nine months after oil prices began falling, highlight how long it can take for an oil price slump to seep into a more general economic indicators.      At the heart of the Permian Basin, one of the biggest oil deposits in the country, Midland experienced lightning fast growth over the past five years as energy companies flocked in, bringing jobs, investment and large construction projects.Now, a 50 percent drop in oil prices since June to below $50 a barrel, the biggest decline since the recession, has forced drillers to cut their workforces, slow drilling and halt investments.  The city's overheated housing market has also shown signs of easing. The 514 unsold houses on the market in Midland County in January was most in years, according to county statistics. The average sale price fell 20 percent from June to January. Foreclosures starts jumped 193 percent from 40 in 2013 to 117 in 2014, with most of that growth occurring in the second half of the year, according to data from Realty Trac. ""The most visible sign of cracks in the armor of the Midland housing market is the rise in foreclosure starts in 2014,"" said Realty Trac vice president Daren Blomquist.City officials are aware of the early warning signs. An annual city council retreat that will focus on maintaining economic growth amid the oil industry downturn has been delayed until May to allow the city to gather more sales tax data before making budgeting decisions, said Midland mayor Jerry Morales.  ""We feel this is a cooling period,"" he said. ""We know sales taxes will decline, we just do not know to what level."" So far, the effects have been limited. Oil companies including Chevron (CVX.N), Occidental Petroleum (OXY.N) and Schlumberger (SLB.N) are all building facilities in Midland, according to city building official Steve Thorpe. Apache Corp (APA.N) and EOG Resources (EOG.N) have sought approval for building permits. The City Council is considering a permit for a $100 million boutique hotel, health club and food emporium on city land. A plan by Xcor Aerospace to build a launch pad for 90-minute, $90,000 tourist space shuttle rides from Midland airport remains on track. It is anyone's guess how long oil prices will remain depressed. Some say it could be months, even years, before oil producing regions recover from low oil prices. ""There is an incorrect assumption that we are further into this than we already are,"" said Ingham. ""We have a long way to go.""
