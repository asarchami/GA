0,"  LONDON Jan 10 Philip Morris International  said on Friday it would invest up to 500 million euros ($679 million)to build a factory near Bologna, Italy to produce cigarette alternatives, a growing market as sales of traditional cigarettes weaken.The company, which sells No. 1 cigarette brand Marlboro outside the United States, said construction on the factory is to begin immediately and take about two years. Once fully operational, it will employ up to 600 people. The company's ""reduced risk"" portfolio includes products that heat tobacco rather than burning it. It plans to accelerate commercialisation of one of these products in the second half of 2014 in selected cities, before a full market launch in 2015.  The company said last month that it was teaming up with Altria Group, which sells Marlboro cigarettes in the United States, to exclusively sell each others' e-cigarettes and other alternative products.",2014-01-10,PM,"Fri Jan 10, 2014 | 7:05am EST",Philip Morris to build Europe plant for cigarette alternatives,http://www.reuters.com//article/philipmorris-idUSL6N0KK1EC20140110?type=companyNews
1,"   By Steve Gorman | LOS ANGELES  LOS ANGELES Eric Lawson, one of several actors who depicted the ""Marlboro Man"" cowboy in a long-running series of cigarette ads for Philip Morris and later appeared in an anti-tobacco message for the American Cancer Society, has died of lung disease.He was 72, and died at his home in the central California town of San Luis Obispo of respiratory failure due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which the U.S. surgeon general has linked to smoking.His death was reported by his family in an obituary notice published on Sunday in the Los Angeles Times. The date of his death was not specified.The square-jawed Lawson played dozens of bit parts in television shows spanning three decades, starting in the 1970s, including ""Baretta,"" ""The Waltons,"" ""CHiPs,"" ""Charlie's Angeles and ""The A-Team.""His screen credits also included appearances in several relatively obscure film titles, such as ""Gymkata,"" ""King Cobra"" and ""Tall Tale,"" but his acting career was disrupted by an accident he suffered while filming the 1991 movie ""The Shooter,"" according to his obituary. Lawson was perhaps best recognized for his appearances during the late 1970s and early 1980s as the rugged cowboy in Marlboro Man print ads for Marlboro-brand cigarettes, one of the world's most successful commercial campaigns.The Marlboro Man promotion was launched in the 1950s as a way of instilling a masculine image for then-newly filtered Marlboro cigarettes, originally considered a women's brand, and repositioning them as a tobacco choice for men.The campaign was seen as instrumental in establishing Marlboro as the top-selling cigarette brand in the United States and internationally, said Tom Glynn, director of cancer science and trends for the American Cancer Society. Years later, however, Lawson became outspoken in warning of the dangers of cigarettes, appearing in a 1998 anti-tobacco public service message for the American Cancer Society that parodied the Marlboro man character.In the 30-second ad, western-style music plays in the background as Lawson is seen in his full cowboy regalia, smoking, riding his horse, herding cattle, mending fences, splitting firewood and then puffing away on another cigarette when the music abruptly ends with a loud thud.

5,"  SYDNEY American cigarette and tobacco company Philip Morris International Inc (PM.N) plans to stop manufacturing cigarettes in Australia by the end of the year, citing government production regulations that restrict its export opportunities.Philip Morris said it would shift manufacturing from Victoria state to South Korea, where it would not be bound by so-called ""reduced-fire risk"" laws which mean it must use particular paper and construction methods.""With any significant export opportunity restricted by Australian government regulations, our Moorabbin factory is significantly under-utilized, operating at less than half of its currently installed capacity,"" John Gledhill, managing director for Australia, New Zealand and Pacific Islands, said in a statement.The company had invested heavily in the factory from 2006 to 2009 to capitalize on increased demand in Asia. But it said the introduction of the government's reduced-fire risk requirements in 2010, which are designed to ensure a cigarette self-extinguishes when dropped on the ground, led to taste changes that did not match consumer preferences in Asia. About 180 jobs will be cut at Moorabbin, which was the first Philip Morris affiliate established outside the United States 60 years ago.The company will continue to employ around 550 people in Australia in sales, finance and retail. Gledhill said Philip Morris' sales and production volumes were stable in 2013, despite the introduction of Australia's plain packaging laws in December 2012. Those laws, the most stringent in the world, require standardized packaging on all tobacco products, forcing companies to replace logos and branding with graphic images of smoking-related diseases on a drab background.Clayton Ford, a spokesman for Philip Morris, said the factory closure was in no way related to the plain packaging laws.(Reporting by Thuy Ong and Jane Wardell; Editing by Stephen Coates)",2014-04-02,PM,"Wed Apr 2, 2014 | 12:02am EDT",Philip Morris to stop cigarette production in Australia,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-philipmorris-australia-idUSBREA3102F20140402?type=companyNews

8,"   By Wayne Cole | SYDNEY  SYDNEY Job losses in manufacturing have dominated Australian headlines -- 350 at BP (BP.L), 180 at Philip Morris (PM.N), 300 at Boeing (BA.N) in the past month alone -- but data proven to herald increased hiring tell a much cheerier tale.In a country obsessed with real estate, a housing boom has given people confidence to spend more freely -- and that may be enough to keep a lid on unemployment in the year ahead.""Overall, our range of forward-looking indicators of economy-wide jobs growth unanimously point to improved hiring intentions and a turning point in the labor market,"" said Scott Haslem, chief economist at UBS.Hopes are fixed in particular on retail and construction, where a revival in consumer spending, an invasion of foreign retailers and a surge in home building all bode well for a sizable pick-up in employment.If past patterns on measures such as job advertisements, vacancies and a range of business surveys hold true, Haslem estimates that retail, hospitality and wholesale combined with construction could generate around 140,000 jobs in the coming year.That would not be far from the 170,000 needed to stabilize the unemployment rate near its current level of 6 percent.""Our clients are always asking 'where will the jobs come from?'"" said Haslem. ""But our analysis shows it is much less difficult to answer the question than is widely believed.""The reasons for uncertainty seem clear. Unemployment has risen to 6.0 percent, the highest since mid-2003. The central bank expects the labor market to stay soft and the unemployment rate to rise further.In February, Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T) became the last of the global automakers to say it planned to cease production in Australia, triggering angst about the future of manufacturing.FOREIGN BRANDS SET UP SHOP  But the situation for manufacturers is not as bad as the headlines suggest. Over the six months to February, for example, manufacturing actually added 38,200 jobs.And after a long fallow period, retailers have enjoyed a marked acceleration in spending in recent months. The annual growth rate in sales quadrupled from a Scrooge-like 1.2 percent in mid-2013 to a far more store-friendly 4.9 percent in February.That is good news for the labor market as the A$270 billion ($250 billion) retail sector is the second-biggest employer behind health, with 10 percent of all jobs. Add in the wholesale and hospitality sectors, and the job share rises to 20 percent.Australia's two biggest supermarket chains certainly seem optimistic. Coles, owned by Wesfarmers (WES.AX), plans to invest A$1.1 billion over the next three years building 70 stores and creating more than 16,000 jobs. Rival Woolworths (WOW.AX) will open 108 new stores in its 2014 fiscal year alone, generating around 7,000 jobs.The pipeline of construction work is already swelling, with the value of building approvals across the retail and wholesale sectors up 24 percent in February from a year earlier. And it is not just local retailers. Australia is suddenly attracting a flood of new entrants, encouraged by its strong currency and rapid population growth.Zara (ITX.MC), Gap (GPS.N), H&M (HMb.ST) and Topshop are among the big-name foreign retailers to have set up shop, while Japanese casual-wear group Uniqlo (9983.T) opens its first store in Australia this month, as does U.S. chain Brooks Brothers.MANY HOMES TO BUILD, FURNISH The revival in spending owes much to a red-hot housing market. Historically low mortgage rates have unleashed pent-up demand and lifted home prices in the major cities by over 10 percent in the past year.Property consultant RP Data estimates there were almost a quarter of a million properties advertised for sale over March, yet demand stayed ahead of supply. ""Although new listings are way up on a year ago, the rate of sale is much faster,"" says RP Data research director Tim Lawless. ""To put it simply, properties are being absorbed by the market faster than they are being listed for sale.""The Housing Industry Association (HIA) estimates sales of new homes jumped 4.6 percent in February to their highest in almost three years.All these homes have to be kitted out, boosting demand for everything from furniture, to appliances to garden equipment.Sales of household goods surged 3.8 percent in the first two months of the year. Sales of hardware, building and garden supplies grew an annual 10.7 percent, the fastest in a decade.There is much more to come as approvals to build new homes were up by almost a quarter in February from a year earlier and not far from all-time highs at an annualized rate of 200,000.

10,"  (Adds analyst comment, background)SEOUL, April 14 South Korea's state health insurer is seeking an initial 53.7 billion won ($51.9 million) from three tobacco companies, including the local units of Philip Morris International and British American Tobacco , to offset treatment costs for diseases linked to smoking.The National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) said on Monday it was suing the two global cigarette makers, as well as local market leader KT&G Corp, in a South Korean court.The lawsuit is the first by a state organisation against tobacco firms among 37 countries and territories in the Western Pacific, according to the World Health Organization.Only four tobacco lawsuits have ever been heard in South Korea, all by individuals or families, so there is no precedent of a successful action against a tobacco company. Even if the insurer prevails, Morningstar analyst Philip Gorham said the damages being sought are so small the companies should be able to easily cover it through their cash flow.""The broader issue is, do other governments try to do the same thing, and I don't see why not. It's a legitimate thing to go after to solve a legitimate problem,"" Gorham said.""We believe the NHIS, as it takes responsibility for the health of the public and oversees the insurance budget, has a natural duty to bring this tobacco lawsuit,"" NHIS lawyer An Sun-young told reporters. The damages were calculated based on data on payments by state insurers for patients with three cancer types associated with smoking, NHIS added.

""We continue to face significant currency headwinds, an improving but weak macro-economic environment in the European Union and known challenges in Asia,"" Chief Executive Andre Calantzopoulos said in a statement.However, Philip Morris expects adjusted profit in 2014 to rise 6 to 8 percent from the $5.40 it reported last year. The company forecast a 2 to 3 percent fall in 2014 total cigarette industry volume, excluding China and United States.Philip Morris also said it acquired Nicocigs Ltd, a U.K.-based e-cigarette maker to get access to the growing e-cigarette category in the U.K. market. Financial terms were not disclosed, but the company said the deal is not material to its 2014 results or cash flow.The company, which plans to launch a proprietary e-cigarette in 2016, said its reduced-risk products are expected to add to its bottom line within next three to four years. Philip Morris said last year it would enter the e-cigarette business in the second half of 2014 to tap fast-growing demand for a less harmful alternative to cigarettes.The company teamed up with Altria Group in 2013 to market electronic cigarettes and other ""reduced risk"" tobacco products.Less dangerous alternatives to cigarettes are a key focus for big tobacco firms as governments worldwide crack down and consumers cut back consumption.Philip Morris shares closed at $88.89 on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday.

17,"  LONDON, June 27 Marlboro cigarette maker Philip Morris International is seeking to challenge Europe's new laws on tobacco products, the latest clash between Big Tobacco and governments seeking tighter regulation.Philip Morris, the world's biggest international cigarette company, said it filed papers on Friday in an English court seeking a review of the EU's Tobacco Products Directive (TPD) by the Court of Justice of the European Union. The directive, which entered into force last month, requires measures including pictorial and text health warnings across 65 percent of tobacco packages, deeper track and trace capabilities to fight the illicit trade in cigarettes and a ban on menthol cigarettes after a four-year phase-out period. Philip Morris is asking the court to review whether the directive complies with EU treaties in three areas. The first is whether the ban on menthol disrupts the internal market, the second is whether an apparent ban on ""truthful and non-misleading claims"" on packages hurts consumers' rights to information, and the third is whether the delegation of powers to the European Commission complies with EU treaties. The review process is expected to take as much as two to three years, Philip Morris said.

18,"  (Repeat for additional subscribers)July 8 (The following statement was released by the rating agency)Fitch Ratings has affirmed US-based tobacco group Philip Morris International, Inc's  (PMI) Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) and senior unsecured rating at 'A' and its Short-term IDR at 'F1'. The Outlook on the Long-term IDR is Stable.The ratings reflect PMI's strong operating profile, supported by its leading  market shares and pricing power, which translates into a healthy operating  EBITDA margin in excess of 47%. The ratings also reflect stable and strong  underlying free cash flow (FCF) of USD4bn on average despite weak trading  conditions in the European Union and a few adverse one-offs in Asia in 1Q14.This is, however, balanced by a lack of leverage headroom; Fitch expects PMI's  gross FFO leverage over 2014-2017 to be above the 2.5x-2.7x maximum threshold  compatible with the current 'A' rating. However, this is mitigated by PMI's  proven ability to sustain its profit margins and Fitch's expectations that it  will retain strong overall financial flexibility.KEY RATING DRIVERS No Leverage HeadroomThe forecast increase in FFO leverage over 2014-2017 to above 2.5x-2.7x (FYE13:  2.7x) is a result of PMI's debt issuance to fund its share buyback programme.  However, Fitch views positively the announced reduction of share buyback to a  level equal to annual FCF (around USD2bn-USD3bn) from 2015, indicating PMI's  willingness to protect its credit metrics. As a consequence of this scale-back,  Fitch estimates that FCF will be able to cover all of PMI shareholder  distributions from 2015 onwards. PMI's long-term dividend payout ratio target of  65% is in line with other tobacco companies.Undistributed Foreign Earnings (UFE)There is a mismatch between earnings and debt given that PMI does not have any  sales in the US while debt is raised at the holding level (domiciled in the US).While PMI repatriates its foreign earnings, repatriation of accumulated  remaining unremitted foreign earnings is unlikely to be immediate, but possible  in the future and could be costly under the current US tax regime. Also, PMI's  cash balances (mostly foreign) (USD2.2bn at FYE13) are small relative to other  US multi-nationals and to its total UFE (USD20bn at FYE13) figure. As a  consequence, Fitch considers only PMI's gross leverage ratios to reflect these  foreign cash balances. Significant Shareholder DistributionsPMI has historically distributed more than its FCF generated to shareholders  through dividend (a high payout ratio of 70%) and share buyback programmes.  While PMI's cash flow continues to demonstrate considerable stability at  USD8bn-USD9bn (FCF before dividend) a year, the extent to which PMI allocates  cash flow to shareholders or M&A is the main driver of leverage, which is  currently outside the range compatible with its 'A' rating.International LeaderPMI is the leading company in the global tobacco industry (excluding the US and  China), supported by the diversity of its portfolio of brands and the countries  in which it operates. It enjoys large market shares and pricing leadership in  many of the world's most profitable and growing tobacco markets, with superior  diversification across continents. Solid Innovation CapabilityFitch is confident that PMI would be able to manage successfully a transition of  tobacco consumption towards e-cigarettes or other reduced-risk products, should  these trends accelerate. The products that PMI has available and under  development as well as its market clout should allow it to win against small  independent e-cigarette players.Geographical Diversity Protects VolumesIn 2013, the EU market (30% of PMI's profits) suffered from a sharper  contraction than seen previously. However, PMI's strong presence in developing  markets remains key to its ability to protect volumes. Price increases in the EU  and other regions should continue to offset volume decline and support profit  growth, although probably at a slower pace. Additionally, 1Q14 results have  confirmed that the volume decline in the EU market was slowing due to overall  stabilisation in illicit trade during 2013, slower growth of e-vapor products in  many markets and reduced down-trading to fine-cut products. RATING SENSITIVITIES Negative: Future developments that could lead to a negative rating action  include:-Spending on acquisitions or share buybacks, combined with slower-than-expected  growth of revenue and profit, leading to gross lease-adjusted debt/FFO above  2.5x-2.7x (FY14 forecast: 3.0x)-FFO fixed charge coverage below 8x (FY14F: 8.5x)-Unfavourable tobacco litigation outcome requiring PMI to pay a large  compensation-EBITDA margin declining below 45% (FY14F: 47.1%)Positive: Although Fitch does not currently expect management to pursue  financial policies that would be commensurate with an upgrade, future  developments that could lead to a positive rating action include:-Maintaining gross lease-adjusted debt/FFO sustainably below 1.8x-Maintaining the current level of profitability and enhanced FCF generation, in  the absence of shocks from far more stringent regulation, and a more  conservative financial policy",2014-07-08,PM,"Tue Jul 8, 2014 | 5:45am EDT",RPT-Fitch Affirms Philip Morris International at 'A'; Outlook Stable,http://www.reuters.com//article/fitch-affirms-philip-morris-internationa-idUSFit70790320140708?type=companyNews
19,"   By Sharon Begley | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Drugmakers' use of the tobacco plant as a fast and cheap way to produce novel biotechnology treatments is gaining global attention because of its role in an experimental Ebola therapy.The treatment, which had been tested only in lab animals before being given to two American medical workers in Liberia, consists of proteins called monoclonal antibodies that bind to and inactivate the Ebola virus.For decades biotech companies have produced such antibodies by growing genetically engineered mouse cells in enormous metal bioreactors. But in the case of the new Ebola treatment ZMapp, developed by Mapp Pharmaceuticals, the antibodies were produced in tobacco plants at Kentucky Bioprocessing, a unit of tobacco giant Reynolds American. The tobacco-plant-produced monoclonals have been dubbed ""plantibodies.""""Tobacco makes for a good vehicle to express the antibodies because it is inexpensive and it can produce a lot,"" said Erica Ollmann Saphire, a professor at The Scripps Research Institute and a prominent researcher in viral hemorrhagic fever diseases like Ebola. ""It is grown in a greenhouse and you can manufacture kilograms of the materials. It is much less expensive than cell culture.""In the standard method of genetic engineering, DNA is slipped into bacteria, and the microbes produce a protein that can be used to combat a disease.A competing approach called molecular ""pharming"" uses a plant instead of bacteria. In the case of the Ebola treatment, Mapp uses the common tobacco plant, Nicotiana benthanmianas.The process is very similar. A gene is inserted into a virus that is then used to infect the tobacco plant. The virus acts like a micro-Trojan Horse, ferrying the engineered DNA into the plant.Cells infected with the virus and the gene it is carrying produce the target protein. The tobacco leaves are then harvested and processed to extract the protein, which is  purified.ZMapp's protein is a monoclonal antibody, which resembles ordinary disease-fighting antibodies but has a highly specific affinity for particular cells, including viruses such as Ebola. It attaches itself to the virus cells and inactivates them. APPROVAL PROCESS The drug so far has only been produced in very small quantities, but interest in it is stoking debate over whether it should be made more widely available to the hundreds of people stricken with Ebola in Africa while it remains untested.“We want to have a huge impact on the Ebola outbreak,” Mapp CEO Kevin Whaley said in an interview at company headquarters in San Diego. ""We would love to play a bigger role.”Whaley said he was not aware of any significant safety issues with the serum. He would not discuss whether the company has been contacted about providing the drug overseas.  But he did note the novel manufacturing process carries its own risk, and would have to be cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as part of the approval process.The FDA would, for example, have to be satisfied that the plant extraction process had not led to contamination of the resulting drug. The tobacco plant grows quickly, said Reynolds spokesman David Howard, and ""it takes only about a week (after the genes are introduced) before you can begin extracting the protein.""He declined to say how much medication each plant can yield or whether Kentucky Bioprocessing is in a position to produce ZMapp in significant quantities.Scripps' Saphire said it can still take anywhere from one to three months to produce the ZMapp serum for wider use given the complexities of the process.  PENTAGON FUNDING In 2007, Kentucky Bioprocessing entered into an agreement with Mapp Biopharmaceutical and the Biodesign Institute of Arizona State University to refine the tobacco-plant approach. The approach attracted funding support from the Pentagon's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). For all the hope, however, the plant technique has delivered few commercial products. In 2012 the FDA okayed a drug for the rare genetic disorder Gaucher disease from Israel's Protalix BioTherapeutics and Pfizer. Called Elelyso, it is made in carrot cells, and is the only such drug to reach the market.Other companies have fallen far short, though it is not clear if the technique was to blame. Calgary-based SemBioSys Genetics Inc, which used safflowers to produce an experimental diabetes drug, folded in 2012 before it finished clinical trials.Even Kentucky Bioprocessing, which at one point was developing monoclonal antibodies against HIV (the virus that causes AIDS), C. difficile bacterial infection, and the human papillomavirus, has dropped the last two projects, Howard said.Last year Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corp acquired a majority share of Quebec City-based Medicago, which is developing influenza and other vaccines using the tobacco-plant technology.

22,"   By Lawrence Hurley | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON A U.S. appeals court on Tuesday revived a lawsuit against Philip Morris USA Inc that claims the tobacco company defrauded the federal government by failing to sell cigarettes to military vendors at the lowest price.The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit said that a lower court judge should not have dismissed the lawsuit by Anthony Oliver, the president and CEO of Medallion Brands International Co, another cigarette company.The 2008 lawsuit against Philip Morris, an Altria Group Inc company, concerns cigarette sales to the Navy Exchange Service Command and the Army and Air Force Exchange Service, both of which operate facilities that sell products to military personnel and their families. Oliver said Philip Morris sold cigarettes to its affiliates at lower rates than those the government paid. The lawsuit claimed Philip Morris charged millions of dollars more each year than it should have.Philip Morris said in court papers that Oliver is simply a competitor who also sells cigarettes to the military and has ""no inside information"" about the claims. In Tuesday's ruling, the appeals court said the lawsuit could proceed because the information on which it was based was not, as the lower court found, already publicly disclosed.The False Claims Act allows citizens, as well as the government, to bring claims. If they win, they receive a percentage of the damages. Lawsuits cannot be based on information that is already public. The case is United States of America v.

Philip Morris said in court papers that Oliver is simply a competitor who also sells cigarettes to the military and has ""no inside information"" about the claims.In Tuesday's ruling, the appeals court said the lawsuit could proceed because the information on which it was based was not, as the lower court found, already publicly disclosed. The False Claims Act allows citizens, as well as the government, to bring claims. If they win, they receive a percentage of the damages. Lawsuits cannot be based on information that is already public.The case is United States of America v. Philip Morris, U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, No. 13-7105.

26,"   By Martinne Geller | LONDON  LONDON Philip Morris International Inc, the world's largest tobacco company, plans to launch its new iQOS smokeless device and Marlboro HeatSticks in Milan, Italy on Thursday following a better-than-expected launch in Nagoya, Japan earlier this month.With a battery-operated system that heats, without burning, small tubes of tobacco called Marlboro HeatSticks, the iQOS is a hybrid between conventional cigarettes and next-generation e-cigarettes.Such devices, including one sold by Japan Tobacco,  are meant to be less harmful than traditional cigarettes but more satisfying for smokers than e-cigarettes, which vaporize nicotine-laced liquid. The burgeoning market for electronic cigarettes is a key battleground for Big Tobacco players such as Philip Morris, British American Tobacco and Imperial Tobacco. Cigarette sales are falling as people around the world quit the habit or cut back on their financial spending. Speaking at a conference on Wednesday hosted by Morgan Stanley, Philip Morris Chief Executive Andre Calantzopoulos called the launch ""a landmark moment"" that opened a ""groundbreaking new chapter in the history of our company"".""Whilst it is early days our results already surpass our expectations,"" Calantzopoulos said of the Nov. 4 launch in Japan, where the kit has a recommended price of 6,980 yen ($59.31) and the plug-in HeatSticks, which resemble mini cigarettes, cost 460 yen ($3.91) for a pack of 20, in line with traditional Marlboros.In Europe, where taxes are higher, the recommended price of the kit is 70 euros ($87.87) while a pack of sticks is 5 euros ($6.28). Italy has classified HeatSticks for excise tax purposes at a rate similar to cigarettes, but Calantzopoulos hopes a law change will reduce the rate. The company is touting product benefits including no fire, no ash and less smell, but is making no health claims. Launches outside Italy and Japan are not expected until 2016, due to short-term constraints on manufacturing capacity. Philip Morris sold 880.2 billion cigarettes last year, a decline of 5 percent. It says it could sell 30 to 50 billion more sticks if its ""reduced risk"" products were adopted by three to five percent of smokers in the markets it plans to enter in the next five years.

29,"  * Arrivabene appointed F1 team boss* Third man to run Ferrari this year* New principal joins from Philip Morris   (Adds detail, quotes, background)By Alan BaldwinABU DHABI, Nov 24 Marco Mattiacci's brief reign as Ferrari Formula One principal ended on Monday with the troubled Fiat-owned outfit replacing him with Maurizio Arrivabene, the team's third boss in nine months.The Italian joins from sponsor Philip Morris where he held senior positions in marketing and promotions. He is also an independent board member of Juventus soccer club.Ferrari chairman Sergio Marchionne said in a statement that the team and Formula One needed ""a person with a thorough understanding not just of Ferrari but also of the governance mechanisms and requirements of the sport. ""Maurizio has a unique wealth of knowledge: he has been extremely close to the Scuderia for years and, as a member of the F1 Commission, is also keenly aware of the challenges we are facing,"" he added.""He has been a constant source of innovative ideas focused on revitalisation of Formula One. His managerial experience on a highly complex and closely regulated market is also of great importance.""Mattiacci, who replaced Stefano Domenicali when the principal resigned in April, was parachuted in from Ferrari North America where he was president and chief executive. He never looked comfortable in the high-profile sporting role, however, while Ferrari's performance on the track continued to decline.The glamour team ended the season in Abu Dhabi without a single race win, for the first time since 1993, and the conclusion of the campaign also saw the departure of double world champion Fernando Alonso.Germany's four-times champion Sebastian Vettel has been signed from Red Bull as the Spaniard's replacement. Ferrari have also had upheaval at the very top with the enforced departure of long-serving president Luca Di Montezemolo, a link with the team's late founder Enzo, last month.He has been replaced by Fiat Chrysler chief executive Marchionne.Arrivabene ensures Ferrari have a Formula One insider at the helm at a time when the sport faces considerable financial challenges with two small teams plunging into administration and fears that others could follow.There are calls to reduce the price of the new V6 turbo engines and also for a more even distribution of revenues currently heavily skewed towards big teams like Ferrari, the sport's oldest and most successful outfit.Arrivabene has represented all sponsors on the Formula One Commission since 2010, a role that means he is well acquainted with the sport's commercial supremo Bernie Ecclestone.

31,"  MANILA Jan 13 The Philippine affiliate of Philip Morris International Inc said on Tuesday it would cut 640 jobs, or nearly 13 percent of its workforce in the country, as it restructures cigarette manufacturing operations at its Marikina plant in Manila.The plant, which employs 1,640 workers in all, will see its workforce reduced to 1,000 once the job cuts take effect on Feb. 15, said a company source who did not wish to be identified.The Philippine affiliate PMFTC Inc, a joint venture between Philip Morris and unlisted Fortune Tobacco Corp of Philippine tycoon Lucio Tan, employed around 5,000 people in the country prior to the proposed layoffs, with the remaining workers located at another plant in Tanauan City in Batangas province, south of the capital Manila, and at regional sales offices.""This was a very difficult decision to make but in order to maintain a viable operation and to safeguard the future of our business in Marikina, it was necessary to take this step,"" PMFTC Inc President Paul Riley said in a statement.

32,"  (Adds Lorillard comment, background on litigation)By Jessica DyeNEW YORK Feb 25 Three major U.S. tobacco companies - R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co, Lorillard Inc and Altria Group's Philip Morris USA - will pay $100 million to settle hundreds of federal lawsuits over smoking, according to an announcement from plaintiffs' lawyers on Wednesday.The agreement will cover more than 400 lawsuits filed in federal court in Florida by smokers or their families, according to court filings. The settlement will not cover cases that have already gone to trial, or thousands of lawsuits in state court. The tentative agreement will be finalized if all individual plaintiffs participate, or the parties otherwise agree.Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds will each pay $42.5 million, and Lorillard will pay $15 million, according to a lead lawyer for plaintiffs, Joe Rice of law firm Motley Rice. Rice and other plaintiffs' firms that negotiated the deal said Wednesday they were pleased their clients would be compensated after years of litigation.It is the first major agreement reached by the three companies to resolve a chunk of so-called Engle cases, named after a class action brought by Florida residents over injuries or deaths they said were caused by tobacco-related medical conditions. In 2006, the Florida Supreme Court overturned a $145 billion award for the class and ruled that plaintiffs had too many individual issues to proceed as a group. However, the court said plaintiffs could bring individual lawsuits based on findings from earlier in the litigation that nicotine is addictive and that tobacco use can cause diseases.After that ruling, thousands of cases were filed in Florida federal and state courts. All three companies have been hit with millions of dollars in damages from dozens of Engle cases that have gone to trial. In 2013, Liggett Group and parent company Vector Group Ltd  paid $110 million to nearly 5,000 smoking lawsuits.Murray Garnick, associate general counsel for Altria Client Services, said the agreement was in the company's best interests and that it will vigorously defend unsettled lawsuits.R.J. Reynolds Assistant General Counsel Jeff Raborn said the agreement presented an opportunity for the company, an indirect subsidiary of Reynolds American Inc, to put the federal litigation behind it. Lorillard general counsel Ronald Milstein said the company was pleased to have resolved the federal cases on favorable terms.Shares of Lorillard were up 0.2 percent in morning trading, while Reynolds American and Altria each gained 0.3 percent.

36,"  April 16 Philip Morris International Inc's  shares are on track for their best day in over six years after the maker of Marlboro cigarettes raised its full-year profit forecast as it sold more cigarettes at higher prices, especially in Europe.Philip Morris's shares rose as much as 8.3 percent on Thursday, their biggest intraday percentage gain since November 2008, after the company's revenue and profit fell less than expected in the first quarter.Like all tobacco companies, Philip Morris is grappling with  falling sales as people cut back on smoking due to higher taxes and growing health consciousness, forcing them to join forces or boost their e-cigarette business.Philip Morris, which also makes L&M, Chesterfield and Parliament cigarettes, bought UK's Nicocigs for an undisclosed price last year to build its presence in the fast-growing e-cig market.Still, shipment volumes of Marlboro, Philip Morris's biggest and most popular brand, rose 2.1 percent in the first quarter ended March 31, outpacing the 1.4 percent growth in total shipment volume. Most of the rise was driven by higher demand in Italy, Spain, parts of Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa, helping the company increased its market share in these regions.""Our organic volume and market share performance was better than we originally forecast,"" Chief Executive Andre Calantzopoulos said in a statement. That helped Philip Morris raise its full-year profit forecast to $4.32-$4.42 per share from $4.27-$4.37 per share.Analysts on average had expected earnings of $4.26 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

42,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) LONDON/MILAN, July 10 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has revised the US-based tobacco  group Philip Morris International, Inc's (PMI) Outlook to Negative from Stable  and affirmed the Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A'. The Short-term  IDR has been affirmed at 'F1'. The revision in Outlook reflects PMI's stretched credit metrics, after profit  margins and cash flow were compressed in 2014 by specific market challenges in  Asia, foreign currency effects as well as investments in reduced-risk products  (RRPs). Past shareholder returns have also contributed to exacerbating the  deterioration of credit metrics.  However, if PMI prioritises debt reduction from improving free cash flow (FCF),  leading to (FFO) adjusted gross leverage to fall below 3.0x or net leverage  below 2.5x by 2016, then the Outlook may be revised back to Stable. Fitch  assumes that there will be no share buybacks during 2015-2018. KEY RATING DRIVERS Profit Margin Compression PMI remains one of the most profitable tobacco companies with its EBITDA margin  of 44.1%, higher than British American Tobacco's 41.3% (A-/Negative) and  Imperial Tobacco Group PLC's 43.1% (BBB/Negative). Yet, in 2014 EBITDA margin  suffered from specific market challenges in Asia (Indonesia, the Philippines and  Australia), transactional FX headwinds and investments in RRPs. While Indonesia,  the Philippines, Australia and the European Union should perform better in 2015,  there is a risk of EBITDA margins contracting further in 2015 as a result of  continuing currency headwinds, an important excise tax increase in South Korea  and ongoing challenges in Japan.  Lower FCF After a period of stability at around USD10bn, PMI's FFO dropped to USD8.4bn in  2014 due to margin reduction and the strengthening of USD against the currencies  of the markets in which the company sells its products. As a result also of  increasing dividend distributions, FCF contracted materially to USD551m (1.9% of  sales) from an average USD3bn over 2012-2013. This adverse effect on leverage,  however, is partly mitigated by almost half of the company's debt (40%) being  denominated in EUR at end-2014.  Leverage Beyond Rating Guidance  FFO net leverage rose to 3.2x in 2014 from 2.6x in 2013 and Fitch projects  leverage to peak around 3.3x-3.5x in 2015 before falling to approximately 3.0x  in 2016, a level still above the 2.5x threshold compatible for the 'A' rating.  Undistributed Foreign Earnings (UFE) PMI faces a mismatch between the location of its earnings and debt, given that  the company does not have any sales in the US while debt is raised at the  holding level (domiciled in the US). While PMI intends to repatriate its foreign  earnings, it is unlikely to be immediate, and could be costly under the current  US tax regime. Our net debt figure now includes a generic 35% tax haircut on cash, which is  based on our conservative assumption that, if repatriated back to the US, these  cash balances would be subject to the maximum US tax rate.   Significant Shareholder Distributions  The deterioration in credit metrics has been exacerbated by large shareholder  distribution up until 2014. Through dividends (high pay-out ratio of 70%) and  its share buyback programmes, PMI has historically distributed to shareholders  more than the FCF it generated. A large part of those share buybacks has  historically been debt-funded, which resulted in an increase in debt quantum  over time.  Fitch views positively the company's announced suspension of share buybacks in  2015, indicating PMI's willingness to protect its credit metrics. However, the  extent to which PMI allocates cash flow to shareholders is one of the main  drivers of leverage, which is currently outside the range compatible with its  'A' rating. Fitch estimates that the dividend pay-out ratio in 2015 will be in  excess of 90%. This is above historical rates and PMI's long-term dividend  pay-out target of 65%.  RRPs Weigh on Profits Fitch is confident that PMI would be able to manage successfully a transition of  tobacco consumption towards e-cigarettes or other RRPs, should the consumption  shift from traditional cigarettes accelerate. The agency believes that, combined  with PMI's market clout, the products that the company has available and under  development, should allow it to win against small independent e-cigarette  players. However, investments in RRPs in 2014 have further impacted operating  profit, adding to the adverse impact from currency movements, a trend that Fitch  expects to continue in 2015.  Scope for Performance Recovery We expect PMI's organic growth to recover over time, driven by better overall  pricing/product mix as well as volume recovery in Asia. In 1Q15, the company  reported good pricing gain of 7.7% and positive volume growth of 1.4%, resulting  in high net revenues organic growth of 9.1%. This followed organic growth of 2%  in 2014, as prices rose 4.8% largely offsetting a volume drop of 2.8%.  Leading Industry Player PMI's ratings continue to reflect the company's leading position in the global  tobacco industry (excluding the US and China), supported by the diversity of its  portfolio of brands and the countries in which it operates. It enjoys large  market shares and pricing leadership in many of the most profitable and growing  tobacco markets, with superior diversification across continents. KEY ASSUMPTIONS - Revenue and profits impacted by currency headwinds as well as investments in  RRPs in 2015 - Low single-digit sales growth and slight increase in profitability from 2016  onwards with price gains offsetting volume declines - FCF margin below 1% in 2015 and resuming around 4% from 2016 onwards - Dividends increasing 2%-3% annually, resulting in a dividend pay-out ratio of  around 80%-90% between 2015 and 2018 - No share buybacks between 2015 and 2018 RATING SENSITIVITIES Negative: Future developments that could lead to a negative rating action  include: - Persistently weaker than historical performance with low or negative organic  growth and operating EBITDA margin failing to return above 45% in 2015 and 2016  (2014: 44.1%) -  Neutral to negative FCF in 2015 and failing to return to at least 3.5% - 4%  of revenues by 2016 (2014: 1.9%) - Inability to reduce debt or increase FFO causing FFO-adjusted gross leverage  to remain above 3.0x (2014: 3.3x) and FFO-adjusted net leverage above 2.5x  (2014: 3.2x) -  FFO fixed charge coverage below 6x (2014: 7.0x) -  Unfavourable tobacco litigation outcome requiring PMI to pay a large  compensation Positive: Fitch does not currently expect management to pursue financial  policies that would be commensurate with an upgrade. Future developments that  could lead to a revision of the Outlook to Stable include: - Evidence that the allocation of improving FCF prioritises debt reduction and  enables FFO adjusted gross leverage to drop below 3.0x or FFO adjusted net  leverage below 2.5x by 2016 -  FCF margin on track to recover to a level sustainably above 5% -  FFO fixed charge coverage sustainably above 6x -  No material cash outflow from ongoing litigation  LIQUIDITY  At year-end 2014, PMI's gross debt of USD28.5bn was well spread out with no more  than USD3bn of bonds maturing in a given year. Fitch views liquidity backstop  resources of up to USD8bn as comfortable considering the projected amount of  commercial paper issuance.

43,"  LONDON Philip Morris International (PM.N) and its American counterpart Altria Group (MO.N) announced on Thursday an expansion of their agreement on e-cigarettes to include research and development, as the market for tobacco alternatives continues to evolve. The companies, which split from each other in 2008, said in 2013 that Philip Morris would have the exclusive right to sell Altria's e-cigarettes outside the United States, and Altria the exclusive right to sell two of Philip Morris's ""heated tobacco products"" in the United States. They also said they would cooperate on scientific assessments of the products, engaging with regulators and sharing improvements in the products.On Thursday, the companies said they were expanding that framework to include a joint research, development and technology-sharing agreement, which a Philip Morris spokeswoman said would set a framework to develop the next generation of e-cigarettes. E-cigarettes, which heat nicotine-laced liquid into an inhalable vapor, have been growing in popularity on both sides of the Atlantic, but remain the subject of much debate due largely to a lack of long-term data about their effects on health. Still, many scientists believe they are much safer than traditional cigarettes.  Altria sells an e-cigarette called MarkTen in the United States, which Philip Morris sells in Spain under the brand name Solaris. Philip Morris also sells Marlboro HeatSticks, made from tobacco, in Italy and Japan.    Separately on Thursday, Philip Morris, the world's leading tobacco company, said it was dissolving a joint venture with Swedish Match (SWMA.ST) that was aimed at selling snus, a type of smokeless tobacco, outside Scandinavia and the United States. The companies said there was a small but growing demand for snus in those markets but that ""development has ... taken longer than the parties had initially anticipated"".The companies will now pursue their own strategies, though there are transitional agreements in place whereby Swedish Match will supply snus to Philip Morris for certain markets, and Philip Morris will distribute the Swedish company's snus in Canada and Russia.

46,"  * Sampoerna selling shares at 63,000-99,000 rupiah each* Sale will be biggest in Indonesia in 7 years* Philip Morris had aimed to raise at least $1 bln by cutting stake   (Adds milestones and background)By Eveline DanubrataJAKARTA, Aug 13 Philip Morris-owned Indonesia cigarette maker Sampoerna is planning a rights issue that will raise nearly $2 billion to meet stock exchange free-float rules, in what will be the Southeast Asian nation's biggest share sale in seven years. Indonesia's biggest listed cigarette maker is selling as many as 269.7 million shares in a range of 63,000-99,000 rupiah each for a total of as much as 26.7 trillion rupiah ($1.94 billion), the company said in a stock exchange filing late on Wednesday.Sources previously said that Philip Morris International Inc  was planning to sell down some of its 98.18 percent stake in PT Hanjaya Mandala Sampoerna Tbk and raise at least $1 billion. The share offering comes a time when Indonesia's economic growth is at its weakest in six years and tougher rules on television advertising are weighing on the cigarette industry.However, Sampoerna's nearly 35 percent market share makes it attractive to potential investors, bankers have said. The company sells some of the most popular cigarette brands, including Dji Sam Soe and U Mild, in Indonesia, a country where smoking remains widespread. Sampoerna competes with PT Gudang Garam Tbk and Djarum Group in Indonesia. The Indonesian stock exchange requires all listed firms to have a free float of at least 7.5 percent by Jan. 30, 2016. Sampoerna can meet the rule if Philip Morris renounces its rights.The share sale would be the biggest in Indonesia since a $4.4 billion deal by PT Bakrie & Brothers Tbk in April 2008. It would also be the largest in Southeast Asia since Singapore lender Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp raised $2.6 billion from shareholders to bolster its capital last September.Credit Suisse, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Mandiri Sekuritas are working on the Sampoerna deal, IFR, a Thomson Reuters publication, has said.

50,"  * JT to buy non-U.S. rights to Natural American Spirit* Purchase to expand JT's premium tobacco range* Deal to allow Reynolds American to focus on U.S.   (Recasts, adds comments from Japan Tobacco, context)Sept 29 Japan Tobacco Inc has agreed to pay 600 billion yen ($5 billion) in cash for Reynolds American Inc's Natural American Spirit tobacco business outside the United States, the two companies said in separate statements on Tuesday. The deal, to be concluded by early 2016 pending regulatory approval, includes related trademarks and subsidiaries primarily in Japan and Europe, where operations will continue unchanged, Japan Tobacco said. (bit.ly/1ODQ2zd)The former state monopoly, still 33.4 percent owned by the Japanese government, has been expanding since privatization in 1994. It bought the non-U.S. tobacco business of RJR Nabisco Inc for around $7.8 billion in 1999 and British peer Gallaher Plc for about $18.8 billion in 2007. Its latest deal will help in its pursuit of Philip Morris International Inc and British American Tobacco Plc  to become the world's biggest cigarette maker.The company said Japan accounts for the majority of Natural American Spirit's sales volume outside the United States, with smokers mainly in their 20s and 30s. Buying the premium brand would extend Japan Tobacco's product line-up, President and Chief Executive Officer Mitsuomi Koizumi said. Koizumi's counterpart at Reynolds American, Susan M. Cameron, said Natural American Spirit would benefit from a sale to a global company such as Japan Tobacco, rather than Reynolds American investing to support the brand internationally.Cameron also said the sale will allow Reynolds American to focus on the United States, as all international rights to its cigarette trademarks will be owned by international tobacco companies.

54,"  * Advocate General says EU tobacco law is valid, proportionate* Opinions are non-binding but often influence rulings* Tobacco firms remain hopeful that court view will diverge   (Adds comments; changes headline)By Michele Sinner and Martinne GellerLUXEMBOURG/LONDON, Dec 23 An adviser to Europe's highest court said an EU law on cigarettes was valid, rebuffing a challenge from Philip Morris International and British American Tobacco, though the court still has to deliver a final ruling.The opinion, if adopted by the court in Luxembourg, would be a blow to Big Tobacco companies, which had lobbied vigorously against what was seen as some of the world's strictest anti-tobacco legislation.In a majority of cases, opinions of the court advisers are reflected in the final ruling, which should follow in the coming months.""(The advocate general) considers the EU tobacco directive of 2014 to be valid,"" the opinion published on Wednesday said.""The EU legislature did not exceed the considerable latitude to be given to it in ensuring that tobacco and related products may be placed on the market under uniform conditions throughout the EU without losing sight of the fundamental objective of a high level of health protection."" Smoking is the biggest cause of premature death in the European Union, responsible for nearly 700,000 deaths per year.The EU Tobacco Products Directive (TPD) was adopted in May 2014 and comes into force next year. Key provisions include the standardisation of packaging, a prohibition by 2020 on menthol cigarettes and special rules for e-cigarettes.The opinion also said an effort by Poland -- the EU's top menthol producer and consumer -- to annul the menthol ban must be dismissed as ""none of its arguments ... is well founded"".The TPD requires health warnings that include discouraging  images to cover 65 percent of tobacco packages. It stipulates cigarette boxes should be rectangular with at least 20 cigarettes, thereby banning slimmer 10-stick packs more attractive to occasional smokers. The e-cigarette rules, which the opinion called ""relatively moderate,"" include a duty to notify regulators six months before products go on sale, prohibitions on advertising and sponsorship and a maximum nicotine content for e-liquids of 20 mg/ml.PLAIN PACKAGING The TPD also preserves the right of member states to introduce stricter packaging rules, such as the ""plain packaging"" law due to go into effect in Britain next year banning all colours and logos on cigarette boxes. In so doing, Marlboro maker Philip Morris claims the TPD would disrupt the internal market of EU.""The directive inexplicably encourages a patchwork of regulations and disregards important limits on the scope of EU legislation,"" a Philip Morris spokeswoman said.Philip Morris and British American, the two largest international tobacco firms, as well as Japan Tobacco International and Imperial Tobacco Group are challenging the legality of the UK plain packaging law in separate proceedings. A verdict is expected there in coming months.Striking down the TPD would cripple Britain's plan to be the second country after Australia to institute the measure, aimed at reducing the number of young smokers by making the packages less attractive.Tobacco companies don't break out sales by country, but they say Australia's move has been ineffective at accelerating a long-term downward trend in smoking.British American, maker of Dunhill cigarettes, said it was ""obviously disappointed"" with Wednesday's opinion.""We have always maintained that the (TPD) represents an unlawful and disproportionate incursion into the autonomy of the Member States and we remain hopeful that the Court of Justice will uphold our challenge,"" a spokesman said.

56,"  JERUSALEM Jan 19 Cigarette giant Philip Morris International will invest about $20 million in an Israeli start-up that developed a metered-dose vaporiser of raw plants for medical use, Israeli news website Calcalist reported on Tuesday.As part of the deal, Tel Aviv-based Syqe Medical will develop technologies for Phillip Morris that will help reduce health risks associated with smoking, Calcalist said, but provided no further details. Officials at Syqe would not comment on the report and officials at Philip Morris could not be reached for immediate comment. Syqe, which was formed in 2011, says it has already developed an inhaler that allows medical cannabis to be delivered in a safe and precise manner. The technology turns cannabis into a granulate and allows it to be taken in standardized doses, Syqe says. The company plans to develop similar systems that can be used with other medicinal plants.

The competitive landscape has very strong brands there,"" Janelle said in an interview on Wednesday. ""But we've made some very good inroads.""Sampoerna competes with PT Gudang Garam Tbk and privately held Djarum Group. Around $16 billion worth of cigarettes were sold in Indonesia, a country of 250 million people, last year - a 13 percent increase from 2014, according to consultancy Euromonitor.Tobacco demand weakened slightly last year as growth in Southeast Asia's biggest economy slowed, but Janelle said he expected the economy to pick up this year thanks to higher government spending. ""The initial signs are that things are looking better in 2016,"" said Janelle, a Canadian who joined Philip Morris in 1991. The company had to close two factories in East Java and cut production capacity at its third-party operators over the past two years partly due to shifting consumer preference away from hand-rolled cigarettes, but Janelle said it currently has no plans for further job cuts.    Sampoerna is Indonesia's largest listed firm, with a market value of around $30 billion after it sold shares last year to meet the stock exchange's minimum free-float rule. Philip Morris owns 92.5 percent, and the rest is in public hands.The government has raised excise taxes for big cigarette companies including Sampoerna by an average 15 percent this year, higher than the average 10-11 percent in previous years.

59,"   By Martinne Geller | LONDON  LONDON Consumer companies are offering investors a small degree of relief from the turmoil in banking and resources in a results season dominated by fears about slowing economic growth.  But those companies say lower oil prices no longer translate into a traditional boost for spending on their products because households are using the money saved at the gas pump and on energy bills to stash cash, pay off debt or on other items.This means those companies may not be as much of a safe haven investment as they used to be in times of low commodities prices or economic stress. Since 2008, food and beverage stocks have offered a 142 percent total shareholder return, nearly double that of the market overall, according to Thomson Reuters global equity indices. Since the start of the year, they have lost 3.4 percent, versus 12 percent for the global index.  ""In the context of a market that's in meltdown, the performance consumer goods has been delivering is pretty good,"" said Jefferies analyst Martin Deboo.Consumer stalwarts PepsiCo (PEP.N), Unilever (ULVR.L) and French cosmetics firm L'Oreal (OREP.PA) all reported better-than-expected revenue in contrast to dismal results from banks including Credit Suisse CSGN.VX and Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE)  and oil, gas and mining firms. Tobacco company Philip Morris International (PM.N) gave a strong outlook and liquor giant Diageo (DGE.L) reported improvements.There have also been good results from General Motors (GM.N), Adidas (ADSGn.DE) and Norwegian Air (NWC.OL), and analysts are on the lookout for similar trends next week in reports from Nestle NESN.VX, Michelin (MICP.PA), Puma (PUMG.DE) and Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL.N).Consumer confidence has risen in the United States and Europe, nearing 2007 levels, and car sales, which analysts call a good proxy for discretionary spending, are showing promise of staying healthy in 2016.UNPREDICTABLE     But companies need to work harder to win over consumers, according to PepsiCo Chief Executive Indra Nooyi.""In the past, we used to say when gas prices came down there used to be a perceptible increase in convenience store traffic,"" Nooyi told analysts this week. ""Yes, we did see an increase in convenience store traffic (of about 6 percent), but I think that game has played out. Now it's going to be how much innovation you put on the shelves and how you execute.""L'Oreal Chief Executive Jean-Paul Agon said he was surprised by the lack of any fuel-related benefit. ""When I ran L'Oreal US ten years ago, every 10 cent, or 20 cents less in the price of the gas translated immediately into more consumption,"" Agon said. ""We started the year, last year, with the idea that the reduction in the price of gas would probably mean an acceleration of the consumption ... and honestly, we did not see it at all.""""We did not see it in America, we did not see it in Western Europe. So we don't have some precise explanation about it. Maybe some people are doing more savings or spending money on other categories.""With global oil consumption around 95 million barrels per day, the drop in prices from $115 per barrel in June 2014 to around $30 now has resulted in savings of about $8 billion per day for oil importers, said Laith Khalef, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers.  ""That's a pretty big stimulus to those oil consumers, but we haven't really seen it yet,"" Khalef said. ""That's a theme that perhaps is not being played out in the market.Part of the reason the fuel price benefit is more muffled than in previous cycles, analysts say, is because consumers are paying down their own debt, uncertain about their future wage growth. Another reason is that there are more things to spend money on that are not tracked by traditional measures, such as online home-sharing service Airbnb or car ride service Uber.""The consumer has arguably been swinging his money around, and is not consistently going anywhere,"" said Liberum analyst Robert Waldschmidt. ""This month it's at the retail outlets, next month it's at the cinema and maybe after that it's a new app."" HIGH PRICE FOR GROWTH  Consumer staples stocks, which include Procter & Gamble (PG.N) and Anheuser-Busch InBev (ABI.BR), have been trading at historically high multiples, anywhere from 18 times earnings to more than 30 times, buoyed by the fact that they are stable, have decent yields in a low interest rate environment and exposure to emerging markets, which up until recently, were significant offsets to weak mature markets. Even though they have tempered their forecasts in the wake of the downturn, they are still seeing top- and bottom-line growth, and many investors are prepared to pay up for that, especially with so many other sectors sinking.""They (investors) are saying 'Look the world is terrible, I'm going to lose money in most places. I'm prepared to pay a high price to be confident for a little bit of growth',"" said Ali Miremadi, fund manager at THS Partners in London which owns shares of Unilever, Nestle, Pepsi and Mondelez International (MDLZ.O).""These are all fundamentally strong companies, which assuming you are going to hold them for a reasonably long period of time, are very reasonably valued.""  Still, valuations do reach a point -- somewhere around 30 times earnings -- where it's harder to justify owning a stock that is delivering only single-digit revenue growth, Miremadi said.Consumer staples do nevertheless offer income, which may become more scarce as companies such as miner Rio Tinto (RIO.L) scrap their dividend payout policies.With dividend payout ratios in the 80 to 90 percent range, tobacco stocks like Philip Morris and British American (BATS.L) lead the pack of consumer staples with yields of 4.5 percent.""Things could be going better, but if people are looking for defensive qualities and income from their equity investments, staples gives you both of those on a fairly reliable basis,"" said Morningstar analyst Philip Gorham.

New institutional owners of Coca Cola Co rose 81 percent.In the past two weeks, the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPRD ETF (XLP) attracted $333 million in net flows while just $105 million went into the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR fund (XLY), according to ETF.com.With relatively high dividend yields, including a 4 percent annual payout to shareholders from Philip Morris International (PM.N), consumer staples companies remain a key holding for investors worried about a shaky global economy, even as the United States shows signs of slow improvement.  Consumer staples companies in the S&P 500 are expected on average to post 3.7 percent higher earnings in 2016, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. That is better than an expected 0.8-percent increase across the S&P 500 but not as good as the 12.4-percent earnings jump predicted for the consumer discretionary sector. ""We still want a fair amount of exposure to staples,"" said Thomas Martin, a portfolio manager at GLOBALT Investments, which owns shares in Campbell, Kraft Heinz Co (KHC.O), Estee Lauder Companies Inc (EL.N), Wal-Mart Stores (WMT.N) and tobacco companies. ""The economy is still bumping along on a slow-growth trajectory,"" he said. The S&P consumer staples index .SPLRCS now trades at about 20 times expected earnings, compared with 17 for the consumer discretionary index .SPLRCD, according to Thomson Reuters data. Following the consumer staples index's 12 percent rise in the past year, some analysts warn of high valuations, with General Mills (GIS.N), Procter & Gamble (PG.N) and most other companies in the sector trading above 20 times expected earnings, compared with an average of 17 across the S&P 500. ""On the consumer defensive side, we view in general the industry as a bit inflated,"" said Morningstar analyst Erin Lash. A year ago, Campbell Soup, Kellogg (K.N), McCormick & Company (MKC.N) and Clorox were among the 10 S&P 500 stocks with the worst average recommendations by sell-side analysts. Many of them warned about a strong dollar's impact on demand overseas and stagnant sales as consumer tastes shifted toward fresher foods.But since then, those stocks have each gained between 21 percent and 31 percent, lifted by cost-cutting initiatives that have improved margins and progress updating their product lineups to appeal to new consumer tastes for ""natural"" and organic food. The S&P 500 is up 1 percent from a year ago.

74,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) LONDON, August 01 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed US-based tobacco group  Philip Morris International, Inc's (PMI) Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR)  and senior unsecured long-term rating at 'A'. PMI's Short-Term IDR and  short-term debt rating are affirmed at 'F1'. The Outlook on the Long-Term IDR is  Negative. The ratings reflect the strong operating profile of PMI, supported by its  leading market shares and pricing power, which translates into a healthy  operating EBITDA margin for the sector in excess of 40%. However, this is  balanced by a lack of leverage headroom. Fitch expects PMI's funds from  operations (FFO)-adjusted gross leverage over 2016-2018 to be slightly above the  3.0x maximum threshold compatible with the current 'A' rating. Fitch expects PMI  to retain strong overall financial flexibility and to maintain a prudent  financial policy as we do not assume the resumption of share buybacks and  acquisitions during 2016-2019. The Negative Outlook reflects our expectation of profit margin erosion and  limited free cash flow (FCF) after dividends over 2016-2017, due in part to  investment in reduced risk products (RRPs), and high financial leverage for the  ratings. We also expect credit metrics to continue to be impacted, albeit  decreasingly, by currency depreciation.  A one-notch downgrade could result from PMI's cash flows being permanently  impaired due to continued investments, operating challenges in key markets or  elevated shareholder distributions. The Outlook may be revised back to Stable if  PMI's superior price/product mix growth and evidence of RRPs breaking even,  without profit margin dilution, translate into strengthening FCF generation,  while maintaining a conservative financial policy. KEY RATING DRIVERS No Leverage Headroom PMI's FFO-adjusted gross leverage continued to increase to 3.3x in 2015 (2014:  3.2x), above the 3.0x ceiling for PMI's 'A' rating. Fitch forecasts FFO gross  leverage over 2016-2018 to continue to be above 3.0x, driven by RRPs-related  capital expenditure and continued currency depreciation, albeit to a lesser  extent during 2016-2017.  Fitch revised the Outlook to Negative in July 2015, reflecting PMI's stretched  credit metrics, after profit margin and compressed cash flow in 2014 due to  market challenges, investments in RRPs, and the negative impact from currency  depreciation. Shareholder returns also contributed to exacerbating the  deterioration of credit metrics.   RRPs' Potential Fitch believes that, combined with PMI's market clout, the products that the  company has available (i.e. iQOS) and under development, should allow it to win  market share against peers. We believe PMI's guidance for incremental operating  companies' income (OCI) from RRPs of between USD720m and USD1.2bn pa. by 2020 is  achievable given the current success enjoyed, especially in Japan where PMI has  now reached capacity limits for its Heatsticks (refills for its heat-not-burn  iQOS product). PMI has begun commercialisation of iQOS since October 2014. Japan  was the first market with nationwide roll-out in April 2016.  However, investments in RRPs since 2014 have further impacted operating profit.  Fitch expects FCF (post-dividend) to be neutral over 2016-2017, due in part to  increased capital expenditure in RRPs, yet we envisage FCF margin would trend  towards 4% by 2018 (2015: 2.4%) which could contribute to a revision of the  Outlook to Stable. Shareholder Distribution Revisited Fitch also views positively the suspension of PMI's share buyback in 2015,  indicating a willingness to protect the company's credit metrics. PMI has  historically distributed to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks,  more than the FCF it generated. A large part of those share buybacks has  historically been debt-funded, which has resulted in an increase in debt quantum  over time. Undistributed Foreign Earnings (UFE) PMI faces a mismatch between the location of its earnings and debt, given that  the company does not have any sales in the US while debt is raised at the  holding company domiciled in the US. While PMI regularly repatriates the  majority of its foreign earnings, a portion of it is held abroad.  The company had USD3.4bn of cash and cash equivalent on balance sheet at  end-2015, all held outside of the US. While Fitch recognised that this cash  balance can be accessed, it also attracts a potential tax cost when repatriated.  Our adjusted net leverage ratios now include a generic 35% tax haircut on cash,  which is based on our conservative assumption that, if repatriated back to the  US, these cash balances would be subject to the maximum US tax rate.  Nevertheless, gross leverage remains a primary ratio for Fitch when evaluating  PMI.  Strong Organic Revenue Performance  In 2015, the company reported pricing gain of 6.8% (2014: 4.8%) and volume  decline of only 1% (2014: -2.8%), its best performance since 2012. As a result  organic revenue grew  5.8% while adjusted OCI grew 6.6% (2014: flat). This trend  continued in 1H16, where the company reported still reasonable pricing gain of  5.1% but declining volumes, resulting in organic revenue growth of 1.9%. We  expect PMI's organic growth for 2016 to be stable, driven by better  price/product mix, against a predictable global excise tax environment and  stable global illicit trade activities.  Regulatory Changes Manageable Fitch views the impact of smoking bans, cabinet display bans and graphic health  warnings on consumption, including the revised European Union Trade Product  Directive, as broadly manageable.  Following its introduction in Australia since 2012, the UK and France  implemented plain packaging in May 2016 with full compliance at the retail level  by January 2017 in France and by May 2017 in the UK. In Ireland, implementation  is subject to a Ministerial Commencement Order, which has yet to be issued. We  believe that while plain packaging erodes the pricing power for more premium  brands and in the longer-term could contribute to reducing the number of new  smokers, the medium-term effect on tobacco companies is manageable, due to their  geographic diversification and to the still limited popularity of this  regulation.  Leading Industry Player The ratings continue to reflect the leading position of PMI in the global  tobacco industry (excluding the US and China), supported by the diversity of its  portfolio of brands and the countries in which it operates. It enjoys large  market shares and pricing leadership in many of the most profitable and growing  tobacco markets, with superior diversification across continents. All these  factors remain consistent with a strong 'A' IDR in relation to other sector  peers and compensate for the elevated leverage which would, in isolation, lead  to a lower rating. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for issuer include:   - Revenue and profits impacted by currency headwinds as well as investments in  RRPs in 2016-2017 - Low single-digit sales growth and slight increase in profitability from 2018  onwards with price gains offsetting volume declines - Neutral FCF generation with FCF margin resuming to around 4% from 2018 onwards - Dividends increasing 2%-3% annually, resulting in a dividend pay-out ratio of  around 80%-90% between 2016 and 2019 - No share buybacks between 2016 and 2019 RATING SENSITIVITIES Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  negative rating action include:   - Persistently weaker-than-historical performance with low or negative organic  growth, the continuation of negative currency impact and slower-than-expected  progress of RRPs leading to operating EBITDA margin remaining under 45% (2015:  42.7%) - FCF margin failing to return to at least 3.5%- 4% of revenues (2015: 2.4%) - High debt levels or failure to increase FFO causing FFO-adjusted gross  leverage to remain permanently within the 3.0x-3.5x range (2015: 3.3x) and  FFO-adjusted net leverage above 2.8x (2015: 3.0x) - FFO fixed charge coverage below 6x (2015: 7.5x) - Unfavourable tobacco litigation outcome requiring PMI to pay a large  compensation Positive: Fitch does not currently expect management to pursue financial  policies that would be commensurate with an upgrade. However, future  developments that could lead to a revision of the Outlook to Stable include: -Improving FCF due to debt reduction, resulting in FFO-adjusted gross leverage  trending below 3.0x or FFO-adjusted net leverage below 2.5x by 2018 - FCF margin on track to recover to a level sustainably above 4% beyond 2017 - FFO fixed charge coverage sustainably above 6x - No material cash outflow from ongoing litigation LIQUIDITY At end-2015, PMI's gross debt of USD28.5bn was well spread out with no more than  USD3bn of bonds maturing in a given year. Fitch views liquidity backstop  resources of up to USD8bn are more than adequate.

77,"   By Sinead Cruise and Simon Jessop | LONDON  LONDON Eighteen months after the launch of a global campaign to persuade money managers to black-list tobacco stocks, just one major European investor has answered the rallying cry.Others are largely sticking with an industry that remains lucrative despite tightening restrictions on smoking and a series of lawsuits in the United States, saying they are duty-bound to seek the best returns for their clients.Even a United Nations-backed treaty which aims to cut tobacco consumption by almost a third within 10 years is failing to deter many investors in the likes of Philip Morris International (PM.N), British American Tobacco (BATS.L), Japan Tobacco (2914.T) and Imperial Brands (IMB.L).""We are firmly of the view that profits, cash and dividends from tobacco stocks have many years of strong growth ahead,"" said Stephen Lamacraft, fund manager at Woodford Investment Management.Still, the Global Taskforce for Tobacco Free Portfolios, backed by the Union for International Cancer Control, has scored one big victory since it began campaigning in March 2015 for financial institutions and pension funds to divest an estimated $60 billion from the industry.In May this year, French insurer and fund manager Axa agreed to ditch its tobacco holdings, becoming the first major European investor to sign up to the campaign, although others had already opted out of tobacco before it was launched.Axa said its role as a health insurer meant it could no longer justify investing in something that had such a ""tragic"" impact on public health. At the time it held 200 million euros in tobacco stocks and about 1.6 billion euros ($1.8 billion) in bonds issued by the cigarette makers. Even then, the process is lengthy. Axa has almost completed selling the shares but will keep the bonds until they mature. Only in 2027 will the bulk - 97 percent - be off its books.Many other investors appear reluctant to discuss the issue. Reuters contacted 24 large fund managers which hold tobacco stocks, and all but seven declined comment or did not respond.INVESTMENT APPEAL According to the World Health Organization (WHO), tobacco kills around 6 million people each year, including 600,000 non-smokers exposed to second-hand smoke. Many of the passive victims are children.The Taskforce's global Project Manager, Melbourne-based Bronwyn King, has persuaded more than 30 Australian superannuation funds to ditch tobacco but the campaign faces a tougher challenge in Europe. The same goes for the United States, where one influential investor, the California Public Employees' Retirement System is reviewing a 16-year investment ban on tobacco after a study estimated the policy had cost it $2 billion to $3 billion in returns.Campaigners reject the fiduciary duty argument - that funds must seek the best returns for their clients. They note that about 180 countries have signed up to the WHO's Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, which aims to cut consumption by 30 percent by 2025 through new regulations and tax increases that will make tobacco less affordable.Currently just a handful of countries fully comply with the treaty, implying a significant future hit to the value of tobacco stocks when others follow suit. ""Over the longer term, (the treaty) has to decrease the validity of the product – you will have fewer people wanting or being able to buy tobacco and that has to impact the investment appeal of the producers,"" said Rachel Melsom, UK director of campaign group Tobacco Free Portfolios.Philip Morris International, Imperial Brands and BAT declined to comment. Japan Tobacco did not immediately respond to a request for comment.ONE BILLION SMOKERS The tobacco industry sells about 5.6 trillion cigarettes a year to the world's 1 billion smokers, many of whom live in low and middle-income countries. Here consumption is expected to keep rising due to growing populations and income.More people are quitting smoking or cutting down in developed countries, but overall revenue and profit margins are consistently buoyed by companies' ability to raise prices.International players have also largely shielded themselves from direct exposure to the U.S. market, which has a history of litigation against big tobacco companies. For instance, Philip Morris has been separated from Altria (MO.N), which sells its Marlboro cigarettes in the United States.In the 10 years to 2015 - a period that included the crisis of 2008-09 - the MSCI World Tobacco Index rose 10.4 percent compared with just 2.64 percent on the MSCI World Index. All this appeals to many fund managers. For instance, the  9.2 billion pound ($12.3 billion) CF Woodford Equity Income Fund managed by veteran fund manager Neil Woodford holds BAT and Imperial Brands - makers of the Lucky Strike and Gauloises brands respectively - among its top 10 positions.""(Tobacco's) dependable dividends are increasingly highly-prized and still represent attractive yields,"" said Lamacraft.The dividend argument doesn't always hold water. London-listed British American and Imperial reported dividend yields of 3.2 percent and 3.78 percent respectively, compared with an average 4.06 percent across the FTSE 100 index. New-York listed Philip Morris International has a 4.01 percent dividend yield.Louise Dudley, portfolio manager at Hermes Investment, said she has barred tobacco stocks because she believes returns are unsustainable in the long-term.""The industry has faced and continues to face increased regulation and consumers are becoming more aware of the health impacts of tobacco. The general trend is towards more healthy lifestyles. Tobacco products don't tend to fit within that.""CLIENT ATTITUDES A spokeswoman for Standard Life Investments (SLI) said its decision not to black-list tobacco reflected the needs and views of its clients. But Melsom said ordinary savers didn't always know where their money was being invested. ""If every individual who has a pension fund could see their level of investment in tobacco and the costs associated with that, I think that would make a difference,"" she said.Client attitudes towards tobacco varied widely, according to Iain Richards, Head of Responsible Investment, EMEA, at Columbia Threadneedle Investments. ""We are satisfied that, for our mainstream funds, our approach is measured, works well and serves our clients' best interests. We therefore don't intend to adopt a blanket divestment policy on tobacco,"" he said.Amra Balic, Head of BlackRock's EMEA Investment Stewardship team (BLK.N), said her firm did not make social, ethical or environmental values judgments on behalf of clients, and company engagement was critical in addressing the health and social risks of tobacco.""I don't think that we will end up, by divestment, in a world where tobacco won't exist, therefore engagement by responsible investors is key to holding companies to account on ESG (environmental, social and governance) issues"". A spokeswoman for M&G, another investor in the sector, said it regularly discussed environmental, social and ethical risks with tobacco company management, and encouraged improvements where it considered performance to be poor.SLI, BlackRock, M&G, Columbia Threadneedle, Handelsbanken and Aberdeen Asset Management all said clients could bypass tobacco with their socially responsible investment (SRI) funds. Handelsbanken said about 40 percent of the assets that it manages are in funds that exclude tobacco investments.The performance of SRI funds, which often also avoid  industries such as armaments and alcohol, is typically benchmarked against indexes that exclude tobacco firms.But mainstream funds are benchmarked against indexes that usually include them. Any that chooses to drop tobacco stocks is likely to underperform its benchmark index, putting pressure on managers to stick with the status quo.""You need to benchmark against other funds that don't include tobacco and see how you how perform in other investments you have put in its place,"" Melsom said.

All tobacco companies face falling volumes in developed markets due to higher taxes and growing health concerns.

85,"   By Taiga Uranaka and Martinne Geller | TOKYO/LONDON  TOKYO/LONDON British American Tobacco PLC (BAT) plans to test a new tobacco-based cigarette alternative in Japan next month, it said on Tuesday, taking aim at Philip Morris International Inc's popular iQOS and Japan Tobacco Inc's Ploom Tech.  BAT said it plans to launch its new product, called ""glo"", on Dec. 12 in the northeastern city of Sendai. It will then use learning from that launch to expand the product nationwide. Glo electronically heats tobacco enough to create an inhalable vapor. That vapor, according to BAT, has about 90 percent less toxicant than smoke. The temperature of glo and the Kent Neostiks that go with it, is about 240 degrees Celsius, whereas combustion in traditional cigarettes takes place at over 800 degrees.  BAT has invested more than $1 billion over the past five years in the development, scale up and launch of cigarette alternatives.It sells Vype e-cigarettes, which use nicotine liquid, in several European markets and is testing iFuse, a liquid-based e-cigarette that also uses tobacco, in Romania. BAT has also developed a nicotine inhaler called Voke that can be licensed as a medical product in Britain, but it is not yet on the market. The glo device will cost 8,000 yen ($76.61) with packs of twenty Kent Neostiks, which come in three flavors, costing 420 yen ($4.02).BAT is also in the process of buying U.S. peer Reynolds American Inc in a $47 billion takeover that would create the world's biggest listed tobacco company.  SMOKELESS WAR  All big tobacco companies are investing in tobacco alternatives, as the cigarette market in most Western countries declines with more people giving up the habit. Some analysts think tobacco-based vapor products will be more successful at attracting cigarette smokers since they use tobacco and might therefore be more satisfying for smokers who cannot quit. Philip Morris chose Japan as a test market for its ""heat not burn"" product due in part to regulations around nicotine liquid.  Its iQOS, introduced nationwide in Japan in April, has turned out so popular that supplies are short. ""At this moment, we are seeing far greater demand than our expectations and iQOS devices sell out as soon as they hit stores,"" said a Philip Morris Japan spokeswoman.Japan Tobacco has also said production of its Ploom Tech has not caught up with demand. It has suspended taking orders on its online store and is limiting supply to stores in the city of Fukuoka, where it is test sold.(Story corrects headline to show product uses tobacco) (Reporting by Taiga Uranaka and Martinne Geller)",2016-11-08,PM,"Tue Nov 8, 2016 | 3:07am EST",CORRECTED-British American Tobacco to test tobacco e-cigarette in Japan,http://www.reuters.com//article/brit-am-tobacco-ecigarettes-idUSL4N1D84V6?type=companyNews

87,"   By Lauren Hirsch  U.S. cigarette maker Reynolds American Inc is seeking a higher price from British American Tobacco Plc after rejecting its $47 billion takeover offer, a source familiar with the situation told Reuters. Last month, British American Tobacco, which already owns 42 percent of Reynolds American, offered to buy the remaining shares of the maker of Camel and Newport cigarettes to create the world's biggest listed tobacco company.""We thought it was a possibility, so it's not too surprising,"" Morningstar analyst Adam Fleck said in an email.""Depending on how another offer from BATS could be structured, there's a bit of a circular argument here for the value of RAI,"" Fleck said. The companies are still in talks and BAT is willing to increase the price slightly, Bloomberg said, citing people familiar with the matter. (bloom.bg/2fQxNIu)Altria controls 51 percent of the U.S. market and Reynolds 34 percent. Analysts estimate the Reynolds' acquisition would make the United States account for about 40 percent of BAT sales and 50 percent of its profits.BAT's cash-and-stock offer would mark the return of the company to the lucrative and highly regulated U.S. market after a 12-year absence, making it the only tobacco giant with a leading presence in the American and international markets. Some analysts have predicted that the deal could encourage current market leader Philip Morris International to reunite with its U.S. affiliate Altria, reversing a 2008 spin-off of the international business.Both Reynolds American and BAT declined to comment. Bloomberg was the first to report on Reynolds' rejection.Reynolds American had a market capitalization of about $76 billion as of Monday's close of $53.05. The company's stock had risen nearly 15 percent this year.

88,"   By Martinne Geller | LONDON  LONDON Philip Morris International (PM.N), the world's largest international tobacco company, said it could eventually stub out cigarette sales as it launched an alternative product in Britain on Wednesday.Underlining the regulatory pressures facing the tobacco industry, a British court also on Wednesday rejected an appeal against new rules prohibiting the use of marketing such as logos or colors on cigarette packs.The British government's victory could spur other countries to follow suit, highlighting the need for tobacco companies to develop alternatives to cigarettes to respond to health concerns that are leading more people to quit a habit responsible for an estimated 6 million deaths a year.Executives from Philip Morris, which sells Marlboros everywhere except the United States, said their ultimate goal was to phase out cigarettes. ""We certainly see a future where Philip Morris no longer will be selling cigarettes in the market,"" Martin Inkster, managing director of Philip Morris UK and Ireland, told Reuters.He said that would take many years and require the help of governments and regulators. Philip Morris still produces more than 870 billion cigarettes each year.Philip Morris, along with British American Tobacco (BATS.L), Japan Tobacco International (2914.T) and Imperial Brands (IMB.L), mounted a legal challenge to Britain's plain packaging law that was shot down by a High Court in May.Philip Morris did not join in the appeal brought by the other three, saying it preferred to focus on lower-risk products such as IQOS. It has not explained the origin of the name, but some observers have dubbed it ""I Quit Ordinary Smoking"".    NEW ALTERNATIVES TO CIGARETTES  The company said IQOS, the result of a decade of research and $3 billion of investment, was a step toward a smokeless future.The device, already on sale in over a dozen markets including Japan, Switzerland and Italy, electronically heats tobacco enough to produce a vapor without burning it. The company says the vapor has less than 10 percent of the amount of harmful chemicals found in cigarette smoke. It plans to have IQOS in 20 markets by the end of this year, and as many as 35 by the end of next year. In the UK, it will cost 45 pounds ($56.14), with a single pack of 20 tobacco sticks, called HEETS, costing 8 pounds ($9.98).The UK is poised to be a big test for IQOS, since its e-cigarette market is more developed than several of IQOS's other markets.Japan Tobacco and BAT (BATS.L) are testing their own tobacco-based products and are pushing hard to catch up to Philip Morris in delivering products that fill the space where the current generation of e-cigarettes -- which use nicotine-laced liquid -- fail.  BAT, which is in talks to buy Reynolds American (RAI.N) for more than $47 billion, has spent about $700 million over the past five years to develop next-generation products. Its line-up is more diverse than those of its peers, including the ""glo"" tobacco device, various Vype e-cigarettes and an inhaler called Voke certified as a medical product. ""Different segments of consumers will prefer different products,"" David O'Reilly, BAT's group scientific and R&D director, told Reuters earlier this month. ""That's why we have a multi-category approach."" With e-cigarettes he said nicotine is not immediately absorbed by the lungs as it is with smoking, so the chemical satisfaction is delayed. But ""heat not burn"" products deliver a quicker and more authentic hit.PMI and BAT both have various other products in development.  PMI is working on a tobacco stick that uses a carbon tip as a heat source to generate vapor, in a product that is even closer to a traditional cigarette as the whole thing can be thrown away after use. That technology is similar to one owned by Reynolds, which BAT would acquire if its planned acquisition goes through. BAT is also working on technology whereby an e-cigarette could deliver an immediate nicotine hit, like tobacco, that smokers may find more satisfying.Imperial Brands (IMB.L), the fourth-largest tobacco company, has so far stuck with e-cigarettes, which are also widely sold by independent start-ups. Health campaigners remained cautious.""If smokers switch to electronic cigarettes or other products that can be shown to cut the risks to their health, this could lead to a big improvement in public health,"" said Deborah Arnott, chief executive of UK health charity Action on Smoking and Health (ASH).""But we need independent evidence to support any claims made by the tobacco industry."" ASH said that until independent evidence shows that IQOS and similar products are substantially less harmful than smoking, they should be regulated in the same way as cigarettes.

89,"  Philip Morris International Inc (PM.N) filed a much-awaited U.S. application to market a new type of cigarette that heats rather than burns tobacco and may carry fewer health risks.        The company's application is the first to seek U.S. approval to market a tobacco product as being less harmful than traditional cigarettes.If approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the company's iQOS device could give it a significant marketing advantage over alternatives to tobacco products, including electronic cigarettes, which are not allowed to make such a claim.The device electronically heats tobacco to produce a vapor without burning it, and the company claims the vapor has less than 10 percent of the harmful chemicals found in cigarette smoke.  ""We are encouraged by the timeliness of PM's first FDA application submission...We continue to believe iQOS is a positive catalyst for both Philip Morris & Altria providing a unique competitive advantage,"" Wells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog wrote in a note.Philip Morris, which was spun off from Altria Group Inc (MO.N) in 2008, sells brands such as Marlboro, Red and White and Longbeach in markets outside the United States. The device is currently sold without a reduced harm claim in several countries, including Japan.     Most traditional tobacco companies are investing in tobacco alternatives as smoking in developed countries has declined.
