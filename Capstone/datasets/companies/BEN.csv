0,"   By Ross Kerber | BOSTON  BOSTON Jan 9 U.S. regulators rejected a request by investment firm Franklin Resources Inc to skip a shareholder vote pressuring it to sell off holdings in companies linked to Sudan, whose president faces international war crimes charges.The decision made public on Thursday by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission made it more likely that the company will put the measure on proxy materials to be mailed to shareholders in coming weeks.Shareholder activists praised the SEC's decision in part because it called their human-rights concerns a ""significant policy issue."" This wording was stronger than the agency has used when evaluating similar proposals in the past.""This is big news for us, that we got an explicit endorsement,"" Eric Cohen, chairperson of resolution sponsor Investors Against Genocide, said in an interview.A spokeswoman for Franklin Resources said executives were not immediately available to comment on the SEC decision. Cohen's group has pressed financial companies for years over their investments related to Sudan with mixed results, often facing opposition from executives who say their firms already comply with international law.But the measures could draw new attention this spring because of recent violence in the oil-rich nation of South Sudan that broke away from Sudan in 2011.Franklin, of San Mateo, California, had $870.6 billion under management at Nov. 30 and is known for funds that invest in developing markets through firms like the Chinese oil company PetroChina. PetroChina's parent China National Petroleum Corp  operates facilities like oil fields and pipelines in Sudan, where leaders face charges of human-rights violations. Sudan's president Omar Hassan al-Bashir is wanted by the International Criminal Court on genocide charges and other crimes in connection with bloodshed in Sudan's Darfur region.Citing PetroChina and its parent, the activists' proposal calls on Franklin's board to adopt procedures to avoid investments in companies that ""contribute to genocide or crimes against humanity."" Last year Cohen's group got a similar measure on Franklin's proxy ballot, but it won just 9 percent support at the company's annual meeting in March. Franklin had recommended shareholders vote against the measure but had not tried to block the measure altogether.In November, however, attorneys for Franklin asked the SEC for permission to skip the measure at its 2014 meeting. They argued among other things that the proposal would micro manage the company's decisions and that Franklin has already adopted principles for responsible investing.The SEC rejected all of the company's arguments, according to a Dec. 30 letter posted to the SEC's website on Thursday and signed by attorney Evan Jacobson.Jacobson wrote that ""In our view, the proposal focuses on the significant policy issue of human rights and does not seek to micro manage the company"" so much that Franklin could leave the measure off its 2014 proxy statement.Jacobson referred questions to the SEC's press office, where a spokeswoman said officials would not comment beyond the letter.",2014-01-09,BEN,"Thu Jan 9, 2014 | 6:11pm EST",U.S. SEC nudges Franklin Resources toward vote on Sudan holdings,http://www.reuters.com//article/franklin-resources-sudan-idUSL2N0KJ1UJ20140109?type=companyNews
1,"   By Nishant Kumar | HONG KONG  HONG KONG Jan 20 Mutual fund manager Franklin Templeton has hired a former hedge fund manager to expand its Asian line-up of products investing in lucrative alternative assets, joining its peers in tapping a rapidly growing market.Scott Collison, who in 2011 launched one of the biggest hedge funds in Asia, has joined Franklin Templeton in Singapore as its first head of alternative sales for Asia, home to some of the world's fastest growing economies and large institutional investors.Franklin Templeton manages some $880 billion worth of assets globally.""It's the convergence of traditional and alternatives managers that I think is the key thing going forward,"" Collison told Reuters in a telephone interview. ""Many years from now, when people will look back, they will see this period as an inflection point,"" said Collison, who shut his hedge fund, Orvent Asset Management, in 2012.Alternatives include hedge funds, real estate and private equity, and these products earn asset managers far higher fees than the traditional mutual funds and exchange-traded funds. For money managers, alternative assets also diversify income streams. After a brief slowdown during the 2008 financial crisis, alternative assets have continued to gain popularity with investors, with large asset managers the biggest beneficiary of inflows.Hedge funds, for example, have seen their assets grow by a trillion dollar to over $2.5 trillion since 2009, according to data from industry tracker HFR. A survey by Barclays, released on Monday, said the industry could raise a net $80 billion in 2014, a nearly 25 percent increase over 2013. The survey also showed that 66 percent of the inflows through September in 2013 went to firms managing $5 billion or more, while 13 percent went to those with less than $1 billion.Globally, asset managers have been scrambling to expand their alternative investment products.U.S. asset manager Principal Global picked a majority stake in hedge fund investor Liongate Capital last year, while Legg Mason bought Fauchier Partners, one of London's oldest fund-of-hedge-funds firms, in 2012.Franklin Resources also bought a stake in fund-of-hedge-funds K2 Advisors in 2012, boosting its global offerings that include alternative products from private equity to commodities.",2014-01-20,BEN,"Mon Jan 20, 2014 | 2:15am EST",Templeton courts Asia investors with alternative assets,http://www.reuters.com//article/templeton-alternatives-idUSL3N0KO0Y820140120?type=companyNews

4,"   By Michael Connor | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Feb 5 Puerto Rico will face trouble selling bonds after Standard & Poor's cut its credit rating to junk status, spelling possible trouble for the cash-strapped U.S. territory as it tries to push ahead with debt deals worth as much as $2 billion, some big institutional investors said on Wednesday.Popular because of its triple tax-free status, Puerto Rico's outstanding debt totals $70 billion, or nearly four times the $18 billion owed by bankrupt Detroit. Some 70 percent of mutual funds dedicated to tax-free bonds own Puerto Rico bonds, according to Morningstar.But the ratings cut by S&P, which came in the closing minutes of trading on Tuesday, could sap investor interest, despite the high yields offered by Puerto Rican bonds.""The island will need to borrow relatively soon to meet its obligations, and it may well find it difficult or impossible to access the market for financing,"" said Peter Hayes, head of BlackRock's Municipal Bonds Group.Puerto Rico officials said after the ratings cut, which opens the government to as much as $940 million in penalties tied to swaps and other securities, that they are studying financing options and instituting cost savings.In San Juan, Puerto Rican Governor Alejandro Garc√≠a Padilla said on Wednesday he would seek to renegotiate swaps agreements and other loans that will require accelerated payments.The island last sold bonds in August and has, according to sources, considered a possible $2 billion financing by institutional investors organized by Morgan Stanley, bond deals and loans by banks on the island. The downgrade ""calls into question whether they'll be able to bring those offerings to the market,"" said Dan Heckman, senior fixed income strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management. ""It just continues to drive their interest expense higher and higher.""Some of Puerto Rico's bond yields now top 10 percent in secondary trading.Puerto Rico is not likely to get much help from Washington; the White House reiterated on Wednesday that it was not considering a bailout for the cash-strapped commonwealth. Bill Delahunty, director of municipal bond research at Eaton Vance Corp, said there are many questions that still need to be answered before Puerto Rico can come to market. For example, investors will key on the bonds' interest rates and credit ratings before deciding if they will be buyers.Likely buyers were high-yield funds with little or no current exposure and hedge funds, Delahunty said. He declined to discuss his firm's investment strategy, but said that mutual funds and other traditional buyers were unlikely to be able to absorb all of the bonds.Lyle Fitterer, municipal bond fund manager at Wells Capital Management, said he would be reluctant to participate in a bond sale if and when Puerto Rico comes to market.""At the general obligation (GO) basis we would not unless there is some sort of specific revenue pledge that would come with the structure or some security package that would go above and beyond the GO pledge and assign some sort of ... tax."" Even so, he said that investors who were inclined to buy new Puerto Rico debt would be little influenced by S&P's downgrade.""Most people consider it to be a non-investment grade credit, and I think at this point, if you're buying it, you better be putting it in a place that takes non-investment grade risk,"" Fitterer said.A big investor in Puerto Rico that now looks like an unlikely buyer of the commonwealth's debt would be the Franklin Double-Tax Free Income Fund, run by Franklin Resources Inc. Last year, the fund's exposure to Puerto Rico topped 60 percent, according to Lipper Inc data.Since the end of July 2012, the fund's net assets have shrunk to $363 million from nearly $900 million. Franklin Resources was not available for comment.S&P's rating announcement, which may be followed by similar downgrades by Moody's Investor Service and Fitch Ratings, had muted and mixed effects on Puerto Rico bond prices Wednesday despite fears of heavy selling on a downgrade.""Puerto Rico's bonds have been already trading in distressed territory since August 2013,"" Citigroup Markets analysts said in a commentary. ""The downgrade seemed to have been largely priced in.""",2014-02-05,BEN,"Wed Feb 5, 2014 | 6:12pm EST",Investors see Puerto Rico downgrade curbing appeal of its bonds,http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-puertorico-idUSL2N0LA1CL20140205?type=companyNews

Fondul completed a second buy-back programme through daily purchases on the bourse and a tender offer, worth an overall 962.6 million lei last year, and shareholders have already approved a third run.

6,"  (Adds Ukraine bond price, other investors, paragraphs 5-6)By Tim McLaughlin and Ross KerberBOSTON, April 9 Templeton Global Bond Fund manager Michael Hasenstab, who has a multibillion-dollar bet on Ukraine bonds, says he is confident the country can flourish over the next decade and that the international community can put together a reform package to solve any short-term liquidity and solvency issues.""I think the current government has done an exceptional job of tackling not just the short-term issues but really setting the stage for Ukraine to flourish over the next five to 10 years by putting in place very difficult, but very important structural reforms,"" Hasenstab said in remarks released on Wednesday.Hasenstab's statements, which appeared in a video of him visiting Kiev, were his first extended commentary on Ukraine since the country plunged into crisis.The $69 billion Templeton Global Bond Fund, which Hasenstab runs for Franklin Resources Inc, held $3.1 billion worth of Ukraine bonds at the end of 2013. He showed no signs of backing away from that big bet.The yield on Ukraine's 2023 bonds has risen in the past week to more than 9 percent amid growing uncertainty. The price of the bonds has fallen during that time to 88 cents from 93 cents on April 4, according to Reuters data. Bond prices move inversely to yields. Franklin Templeton funds are the largest holder of that $1.25 billion bond issue, according to Reuters data. Other major holders of the 2023 bonds include funds run by Boston's Fidelity Investments, BlackRock Inc and AllianceBernstein LP .Last week, Moody's Investors Service downgraded Ukraine's outlook to negative, citing the country's escalating political crisis and its stressed liquidity position after Russia withdrew financial support.A video recorded on April 5 shows Hasenstab wearing jeans and a dark overcoat while walking in Kiev. ""Certainly there is a crisis,"" Hasenstab said in the video, which was confirmed by Franklin Resources. ""One only has to walk 500 yards to the left here and see the square and see the evidence of the challenges that this country has faced.""Hasenstab further talked about how he has been encouraged by the international community's response to Ukraine's crisis.""There has been a very cooperative and proactive relationship that has brought together the U.S., Europe, the (International Monetary Fund) and the World Bank in a very close dialog to come up with a reform package that has the potential to ensure both the long-term success as well as the short-term solvency or short-term liquidity issues,"" Hasenstab said. Last month, the EU said it was willing to provide $15 billion in loans and grants to Ukraine over the next several years. The International Monetary Fund announced a $14 billion to $18 billion loan for Kiev in return for tough economic reforms.Hasenstab is a contrarian bond fund investor who has taken big bets on Ireland and Hungary, for example. He oversees a team that manages about $180 billion in total bond fund assets. The Templeton Global Bond Fund is the No. 2 U.S. actively managed bond fund behind the Pimco Total Return Fund.Meanwhile, the tension in Ukraine remains high.Pro-Russian protesters have seized control of public buildings in two eastern Ukrainian cities, leading to a war of words between Russia on one side and Ukraine and the West on the other. The takeovers intensified fears of Russian military intervention and further western sanctions against Russia.(Reporting By Tim McLaughlin; Editing by Steve Orlosky; Chris Reese and Tom Brown)",2014-04-09,BEN,"Wed Apr 9, 2014 | 6:13pm EDT",UPDATE 2-Bond fund manager Hasenstab encouraged by Ukraine outlook,http://www.reuters.com//article/bonds-ukraine-hasenstab-idUSL2N0N120Z20140409?type=companyNews

The largest position as of March 31, in Ukraine 2017 bonds, was valued at $695.7 million. With $70.7 billion in assets, Templeton Global Bond Fund  is closely watched as a bellwether of Western investor sentiment toward emerging markets. Hasenstab on April 9 praised the Ukraine government's handling of short-term issues and the structural reforms it had  put in place.Hasenstab did not discuss the fund's portfolio in detail, however. A company spokeswoman did not immediately respond on Monday to questions about the latest holdings. Data already released by Franklin Resources had shown the top holdings of Hasenstab's fund on March 31 were in Irish and Polish bonds, in similar amounts as he held in December.Monday's disclosure also showed the fund held slightly fewer amounts of two Russian foreign bonds. On March 31 they made up 0.93 percent of Templeton Global Bond Fund's portfolio, down from 1 percent on Dec. 31.

11,"  (Rewrites throughout with comments and currency details)By Ross KerberMay 22 The leaders of Ukraine are taking advantage of the country's political crisis by enacting long-term economic reforms, the manager of Templeton Global Bond Fund, a leading  investor there, said on Thursday.Michael Hasenstab, whose $70 billion fund held 5 percent of its assets in Ukraine infrastructure and government securities as of March 31, cited changes in the civil service and energy sectors at an investor conference run by fund parent Franklin Resources Inc.""Three to five years from now the crisis is actually going to have improved the credit"" of Ukraine because of the reforms,  Hasenstab told the conference in New York that was webcast by Franklin Resources. Ukraine's months-long territorial standoff with Russia has shaken markets and tensions are high ahead of the presidential election set for Sunday.Ukraine bonds have rallied this month. The price of Ukraine's 2023 bonds has risen to 91 cents on the dollar on Thursday from 81 cents on May 2, according to Reuters data. The yield on those bonds has fallen to 9 percent from 11 percent over the same period. Bond prices move inversely to yields.Global Bond Fund's year-to-date 2.16 percent return lags 87 percent of  peers, according to Morningstar Inc data. The fund's benchmark has risen 3.46 percent so far this year. Although Hasenstab is known as a contrarian manager, his views do much to set the mood of western investors toward Ukraine. Hasenstab said a positive move came with the adjustment of Ukraine's pegged exchange rate, which was costing the country's central bank too much to prop up.""The crisis actually solved that, it blew apart the peg,"" Hasenstab said. And unlike Italy or Spain, Ukraine did not carry worrisome amounts of debt, he said. Hasenstab also said Ukraine's leaders have used the crisis well as a bargaining chip in pursuing internal reforms. He said the likely winner of the election would move to appease Russian President Vladimir Putin, however, such as giving more autonomy to eastern regions and keeping Ukraine out of NATO.Hasenstab called those steps ""the political recipe"" to keep Ukraine stable as a buffer rather than to be caught up in a tug-of-war between East and West.""In some cases a crisis actually can engineer some positive things,"" Hasenstab said.Shares in Franklin Resources were up 0.4 percent in midday  trading to $55.04.

But OppenheimerFunds' management team has kept in place one of the mutual fund industry's biggest bets, on the cash-strapped island's turnaround, fund portfolios show.Much of that bet is not backed by insurance, unlike at other mutual fund companies, according to Oppenheimer's latest disclosure about its Puerto Rico holdings. Unrealized capital losses at OppenheimerFunds could surge if the value of Puerto Rico bonds do not recover.The Standard & Poor's Municipal Bond Puerto Rico Index is down 3.85 percent so far in July, lagging the 0.33 decline on the broader S&P Municipal Bond Index.OppenheimerFunds' Rochester brand of municipal funds ended June with about $28.4 billion in assets. And nearly 17 percent, or $4.7 billion, in fund assets had direct exposure to Puerto Rico. Some $4 billion of that direct exposure was not insured, according to Oppenheimer.Uninsured bonds issued by Puerto Rico's electric authority, for example, are trading around 40 cents on the dollar, down from more than 70 cents in mid-June, according to trade activity quoted on Electronic Municipal Market Access.OppenheimerFunds, a unit of insurer MassMutual Financial Group, declined to comment. Until recently, OppenheimerFunds management team has insisted that Puerto Rico is able and willing to make good on about $70 billion in outstanding municipal debt. But that resolve may be weakening after Puerto Rico last month passed a law that would allow the U.S. territory to reduce or defer payments on its debt, leaving bondholders vulnerable to losses.""Clearly, it is not a big leap to view the legislation as an indication that Puerto Rico's willingness to pay may be weakening,"" OppenheimerFunds told investors in a July 3rd letter. ""But all of this is speculation, and in our opinion, likely premature.""Nevertheless, municipal funds run by OppenheimerFunds and Franklin Templeton sued the commonwealth last month, asking a federal judge in U.S. District Court in Puerto Rico to strike down the law. Fund managers at Templeton, part of Franklin Resources Inc, declined to comment.Small funds run by Oppenheimer appear most vulnerable because they have the highest percentage of direct exposure to Puerto Rico while holding the largest proportion of bonds issued by the island's beleaguered electric authority, fund disclosures show. Nearly 35 percent of the $65 million in net assets at the  Oppenheimer Rochester Maryland Municipal Fund are directly exposed to Puerto Rico debt. None of the Puerto Rico bonds in the fund are insured, according to Oppenheimer's latest disclosure.ELECTRIC SLIDE Making matters more risky, the fund's exposure includes a 4.4 percent holding in Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) bonds. That is considered Puerto Rico's most toxic debt after PREPA recently disclosed it used about $42 million from its reserves to make a July 1 bond payment of $472 million. PREPA's debt also could be restructured under Puerto Rico's newly passed law. In total, Oppenheimer's Rochester funds hold about $821.4 million of PREPA bonds, according to its complaint in the U.S. District Court.Rivals have been less willing to hold uninsured Puerto Rican debt. At Eaton Vance Corp in Boston, municipal funds sold uninsured PREPA debt last year at relatively attractive prices, said Tom Metzold, a senior portfolio manager at the company.In October, for example, Eaton Vance sold uninsured PREPA debt for about 72 cents on the dollar and substituted it for insured debt for about 78 cents on the dollar, Metzold said. That turned out to be a good trade because the uninsured PREPA bonds are now trading around 40 cents on the dollar, compared to insured ones trading near par.""The market is saying that the insurance is worth something,"" Metzold said.Bond insurance guarantees payment of the principal and interest on municipal bonds.While several portfolio managers said they are confident that municipal bond insurers can make good on their Puerto Rico guarantees, credit-rating agency Moody's Investors Service is showing some concern.Assured Guaranty Ltd, MBIA Inc and Radian Group Inc all have significant exposure to Puerto Rico, Moody's said. MBIA's National Public Finance Guarantee reported $1.5 billion in gross exposure to Puerto Rico debt at the end of March.

16,"  LONDON, Sept 22 U.S. fund giant Franklin Templeton has become one of the first major global investors to support selectively buying back into Russian stocks, arguing the recent sharp sell-off had gone too far.The crisis with Ukraine and the subsequent international sanctions have seen dollar-denominated Russian stocks lose almost 20 percent this year.Bank of America Merrill Lynch's investor survey this month also showed that Russia was currently the biggest underweight position in emerging markets. Tucker Scott, Portfolio Manager and Executive Vice President of Templeton's Global Equity Group, however, said the slump in prices may have been overdone and probably wasn't justified by the real-economy impact of the troubles.""We believe now may be a fair time to revisit investing in Russian equities,"" Scott said in a blog posted on Monday. ""We have found that in some cases, share prices of Russian companies have declined in value so far that much of the news regarding the Ukraine conflict was already discounted, and subsequent geopolitical developments haven't created additional market aftershocks."" He added that Russian stocks had recently reached the point where on a 'price-to-book' basis (the share price versus the price of all its separate parts) they were their cheapest in more than a decade. Healthy dividends also boosted their appeal.(for full post click: here)   (Reporting by Marc Jones; Editing by Toby Chopra)",2014-09-22,BEN,"Mon Sep 22, 2014 | 12:56pm EDT",U.S. fund Franklin Templeton eyeing Russian stocks again,http://www.reuters.com//article/russia-stocks-franklin-idUSL6N0RN44720140922?type=companyNews
17,"  LONDON Oct 17 An accommodative stance by the Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank may more than match the Federal Reserve's easing when it was acting alone and this could make European bonds attractive, Franklin Templeton's David Zahn said on Friday.Zahn, who is head of European fixed income and portfolio manager at Franklin Templeton, said the BoJ and the ECB were likely to continue to have a loose monetary policy to combat deflation or low inflation.""When you take into account what Japan and Europe combined are currently contributing to their QE programmes, it probably more than matches what the United States was doing,"" said Zahn in a note, referring to quantitative easing, a specialist term that describes central bank asset-buying programmes. ""So, on a global scale, we have probably just as much or more liquidity being created now than when the Fed was acting alone."" For Europe, this should mean that bonds ""may be a good place to look for potential opportunities,"" while the euro  should probably weaken against the U.S. dollar and - to a lesser extent, the pound, he said. Zahn also said there was probably not a lot of value in UK gilts as the Bank of England was expected to raise rates.""We believe it's not a matter of if, but when it (the BoE)will raise rates,"" Zahn said.

18,"   By Tim McLaughlin | BOSTON  BOSTON The Franklin Income Fund is used to top-dog status among its mutual fund peers, but a 40 percent slide in oil prices since June has hammered its recent performance.At the end of September, the $94 billion fund had nearly $2 billion in bets on the junk-rated debt of several small exploration and production companies, almost all of which have tanked as crude oil futures slumped to four-year lows. But that hasn't hurt the spirit of Ed Perks, the manager of the portfolio, who describes the sell-off in the energy sector as ""indiscriminate.""""I think it's a spectacular opportunity,"" he told Reuters in an interview, adding he is now sifting through hard-hit energy players for those most likely to survive.    The Franklin fund's three-month return is negative 3.93 percent, compared to the peer average of negative 0.74 percent, according to Morningstar. In contrast, the fund has beat 96 percent of its peers over the past decade, with an annualized total return of 6.87 percent. Perks declined to say what he has been buying or selling since September. But he said he is screening companies whose bond prices have plummeted even though their debt maturities are several years out. ""We've seen some bonds down 10 points in two weeks with nothing happening to their long-term liquidity prospects,"" he said. Perks says if he makes the right bets he could boost the level of his portfolio's income over the next three to five years, thanks partly to junk-bond bargain hunting. ""But it's not been pleasant to go through at the moment,"" he said.Jonathan Stanley, a high-yield sector manager at Newfleet Asset Management, said managers who thought junk bonds were too expensive have an opportunity to scoop up beaten-down debt with yields above 10 percent. One prospect is Halcon Resources Inc, which reported about $815 million in liquidity at the end of September. Perks' Franklin Income Fund held $281 million worth of Halcon bonds at the end of September. Since then, the price on Halcon bonds maturing in 2020 has dropped 27 percent. Stanley said the bond market might be too pessimistic about Halcon. ""We're scrubbing the numbers and saying, with oil at $50 to $60 a barrel, who can survive? We're looking at Halcon closely,"" Stanley said.

23,"   By Daniel Bases and Anjuli Davies | NEW YORK/LONDON, March 5  NEW YORK/LONDON, March 5 Boutique investment firm Rothschild has invited investors to organize into a Ukraine creditor group ahead of a sovereign debt restructuring, sources directly familiar with the situation told Reuters.Ukraine's eastern half, where much of its industry is based, is where government forces are battling pro-Russian separatists, putting the nation at risk of bankruptcy.Last month, International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde said Ukraine would receive about $40 billion in total funding over the next four years, nearly half from the IMF. Ukraine's finance ministry has said the package would include up to $15 billion from debt talks with creditors, which are expected to start next month.""We hold Ukraine, and Rothschild asked if we wanted to join them in a creditor group. We declined,"" said one U.S.-based portfolio manager who requested anonymity given the fluid nature of the situation. ""This is going to be a really tough negotiation. How do you do a proper debt sustainability analysis when the country is still at war?"" The Rothschild banker who sent the invitation did not respond to a request for comment.Ukraine's 2017 Eurobond, carries a 9.25 percent coupon. It  last traded at 46.5 cents on the dollar, up 1.5 cents, on Thursday, yielding 51.49 percent, according to TradeWeb .Yield spreads versus benchmark U.S. Treasuries narrowed by 67 basis points to 3,531 basis points on the JPMorgan EMBI Global index. That is the largest yield spread on the index, followed by Venezuela at 2,689 bps. The overall index is at 395 bps. ""There are basically 10-15 (private) investors"" that need to organize, said a second source familiar with the matter who characterized Rothschild's efforts as ""exploratory."" If a group representing more than 25 percent of the debt organize, they could block a deal.U.S. mutual fund firm Franklin Templeton is the largest owner of Ukrainian sovereign debt, holding between 25 to 30 percent of the par value outstanding on nearly every series of government bonds, according to Thomson Reuters eMAXX database, making them the key player in any talks. Franklin Templeton was not immediately available to comment.""But Franklin isn't talking with anyone,"" said a third source who holds Ukrainian debt. ""Other bondholders are talking, so the question is will they play ball or try to strong-arm the rest of us,"" the investor said, requesting anonymity because of the delicate stage of the talks.Complicating matters is the more than 40 percent decline in the value of Ukraine's currency, the hryvnia, which could make the restructuring more painful depending on how it is organized.Ukraine's Ministry of Finance hired Lazard to advise on the debt restructuring.

25,"  The holdout creditor in Stockton, California's bankruptcy case filed its opening brief in an appeal of the city's reorganization plan on Monday, claiming ""no bondholder has ever received so little in the history of municipal bankruptcy.""The creditor, two funds managed by Franklin Templeton Investments, said Stockton's plan to exit Chapter 9 bankruptcy was discriminatory and punitive.Franklin said it would receive less than 1 percent of its $30.5 million unsecured claim in the case, now before the U.S. Bankruptcy Appellate Panel of the Ninth Circuit.The brief claimed that by confirming a plan providing such a small distribution, compared with recoveries of 52 percent to 100 percent for other unsecured claims, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Christopher Klein erred in backing Stockton's exit plan.""The court's errors of law, and the erroneous findings of fact on which those conclusions were premised, require reversal and remand with a direction for the city to fashion equitable plan treatment for Franklin,"" the brief said.   Suffering a steep decline in revenue, Stockton filed for bankruptcy protection from its creditors in 2012. The Northern California city of about 300,000 residents got the green light from Klein to exit Chapter 9 last fall over objections by Franklin's legal team. The Franklin team argued that Stockton would leave its two funds with little while leaving the city's pension fund, the California Public Employees' Retirement System, untouched.Stockton's case had been closely watched in the $3.6 trillion U.S. municipal debt market, with a focus on its pension dispute.

26,"  (Adds background, comments from brief)March 23 The holdout creditor in Stockton, California's bankruptcy case filed its opening brief in an appeal of the city's reorganization plan on Monday, claiming ""no bondholder has ever received so little in the history of municipal bankruptcy.""The creditor, two funds managed by Franklin Templeton Investments, said Stockton's plan to exit Chapter 9 bankruptcy was discriminatory and punitive.Franklin said it would receive less than 1 percent of its $30.5 million unsecured claim in the case, now before the U.S. Bankruptcy Appellate Panel of the Ninth Circuit.The brief claimed that by confirming a plan providing such a small distribution, compared with recoveries of 52 percent to 100 percent for other unsecured claims, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Christopher Klein erred in backing Stockton's exit plan.""The court's errors of law, and the erroneous findings of fact on which those conclusions were premised, require reversal and remand with a direction for the city to fashion equitable plan treatment for Franklin,"" the brief said. Suffering a steep decline in revenue, Stockton filed for bankruptcy protection from its creditors in 2012. The Northern California city of about 300,000 residents got the green light from Klein to exit Chapter 9 last fall over objections by Franklin's legal team.The Franklin team argued that Stockton would leave its two funds with little while leaving the city's pension fund, the California Public Employees' Retirement System, untouched.Stockton's case had been closely watched in the $3.6 trillion U.S. municipal debt market, with a focus on its pension dispute.

34,"   By Sujata Rao and Timothy Mclaughlin | LONDON/BOSTON Sept 10  LONDON/BOSTON Sept 10 A setback in Ukraine for Franklin Templeton's star fund manager Michael Hasenstab hasn't dimmed his appetite for bold bets in markets shunned by others as he boosts exposure to some of this year's worst-performing emerging markets.For a decade, 41-year old Hasenstab has topped fund performance tables, outflanking rivals with outsize investments in unloved markets such as Hungary and Ireland, buying bonds cheap and cashing in as their governments dodged default.But in Ukraine, where Templeton sank around $6.5 billion from 2011 -- owning about 40 percent of outstanding bonds at one time -- he wasn't so lucky.Last month, Templeton and three other funds agreed to write off 20 percent of the value of Ukrainian Eurobonds. Their worth in Hasenstab's main $65 billion Global Bond Fund as of June 30, was $1.32 billion, more than halving from February 2014, though prices have rallied since the Aug. 27 debt agreement.But that has not deterred Hasenstab from seeking out underdog assets. While foreign investors flee emerging markets, more than half the Global Bond Fund's holdings are in developing countries, and scrutinising the fund's investments shows it added to those positions this year.Hasenstab, who oversees $170 billion from his office in San Mateo, California, was not available for interview but he wrote in a recent blog that he saw opportunities amid the turmoil, with investors indiscriminately punishing some markets.""As we remain optimistic regarding the outlook for Mexico and Malaysia, it highlights how our strategies will often be contrarian,"" Hasenstab wrote, adding such a strategy made short-term turmoil inevitable from time to time.Mexico made up 9 percent of his fund by end-June, according to Franklin Templeton's semi-annual report and fund fact sheets,  versus 5.5 percent in February, while Malaysia comprised 6.9 percent, up from 1.4 percent.Both countries have been at the sharp end of the selloff, with Mexican government debt nursing 12 percent losses this year in dollar terms on the GBI-EM bond index. Malaysia has fared even worse, with 17 percent losses as the ringgit plumbs lows unseen since the 1997 crisis.South Korea comprises 14 percent of the fund, up from 12.5 percent in February, while Brazil is steady at 4.6 percent.All those would be considered brave bets, due to risks from tumbling commodities prices, a looming U.S. rate rise and slumping currencies. Brazil's dollar-based bondholders have lost 25 percent this year, for example.But Hasenstab said: ""If we are not underperforming the market or our competitors for some given period, it implies we aren't actually taking contrarian views and making those types of calls that go against prevailing market sentiment."" RETURN TO NORMAL Karin Anderson, an analyst at fund research firm  Morningstar, argues that big punts on underperforming Mexico or Malaysia represent a return to normal for Hasenstab and that it was Templeton's Ukraine foray that was out of character.""For Franklin Templeton and Hasenstab's team, they have a record of investing for multi-year products, of going in when things look ugly and then they get better,"" she said. ""In (Ukraine) they went in when things were good and they got bad.""Ukraine undoubtedly dragged on returns, with the Global Bond fund's performance in the year to June lagging more than half its peers, according to Morningstar. Year-to-date, it has underperformed 83 percent of peers, with 5.8 percent losses. Templeton attributes the underperformance to the fund's negative correlation with U.S. Treasuries, noting Ukraine made up less than 3 percent of holdings. But emerging market underperformance could fuel more short-term losses.Over a decade however, the fund is ranked second in terms of performance by Morningstar, with a 7.34 percent average annual return. Another Hasenstab-led fund, Templeton Global Total Return, tops rankings.""Hasenstab has expressed an interest in wanting to own more Brazilian real and Mexican peso and buying into that weakness when we have this downside may be contrarian,"" Anderson said. ""The fund is doing what it always has and we have high confidence in it.""But investors are jittery -- the household savers who dominate the fund's investor base pulled $3.4 billion from it between January and end-July, after last year's $3.2 billion outflows, according to data from Lipper.Hasenstab's ally has been his fund's huge size, enabling him to stake a few billion dollars in markets where he saw long-term potential. But some say big may no longer be best.Recent marketplace changes -- namely shrinking bond trading volumes, especially in emerging markets -- are increasingly a headache for such enormous funds, said a veteran emerging markets investor, who nevertheless admires Hasenstab as ""one of the great success stories of global investment"".""The less liquid nature of the market has boxed him in, in a manner he couldn't have expected a few years back. Brazil, Korea and Mexico have some of the most liquid emerging bonds so if he wants to be in EM he has to play in those markets,"" the person said.On Ukraine, the jury is still out on how big a loss Templeton will swallow -- the restructuring is relatively generous and already this year, the Eurobonds have risen 40 percent. So while Ukraine may not have been Hasenstab's greatest call, he may well recover the lion's share of his investment.(Additional reporting by Tariro Mzezewa in New York; Editing by Catherine Evans)",2015-09-10,BEN,"Thu Sep 10, 2015 | 7:58am EDT","After Ukraine setback, Templeton bond star Hasenstab buys more emerging markets",http://www.reuters.com//article/templeton-hasenstab-emergingmarkets-idUSL5N11F2RK20150910?type=companyNews
35,"  (Adds more quotes, background)LONDON Oct 6 Franklin Templeton's star bond investor Michael Hasenstab said on Tuesday he was buying select emerging markets such as Mexico, with the current selloff offering a ""multi-decade"" opportunity to buy undervalued assets.Hasenstab, CIO for global macro at Templeton, said also that the U.S. Federal Reserve, which last month delayed raising interest rates, appeared be behind the curve, meaning it would pay to be positioned short in Treasuries.Hasenstab who made a name for himself by buying markets shunned by others, said he was also buying some other beaten-down currencies such as Malaysian ringgit and Indonesian rupiah.""We are buying select emerging markets at multi-decade or all-time low valuations. We are buying the Mexican peso at the weakest level it's been in history of Mexico ... On a valuation level, this is not a once in a decade, this is a multi-decade opportunity to buy very cheap assets,"" Hasenstab said in a video interview posted on the company's YouTube page.Emerging markets are seeing a huge investor exodus, and according to the Institute of International Finance (IIF) 2015 will be the first year since 1988 that net capital flows to the developing world are negative. As a result, emerging currencies have skidded to record lows, as in the case of the Mexican peso, while some others such as the Malaysian ringgit are at the lowest levels since the Asian crisis of 1998.But by buying these assets, Hasenstab is sticking to his contrarian strategy of investing in selected markets that are being shunned by peers, a policy that paid off handsomely in Ireland and Hungary.Many emerging currencies are 15-20 percent undervalued after their falls, Hasenstab said, adding: ""We are quite excited about the return expectations there."" He said, however, he was avoiding some assets, such as the Russian and South African currencies.He also said he was short U.S. Treasuries to position for a higher interest rate environment and that the U.S. yield curve was currently underpricing inflation. ""While for the last 30 years, (you) wanted to make money by declining rates, we think over the next five years you want to make money by rising rates. So the strategy is to position short U.S. Treasuries in terms of negative duration,"" Hasenstab said.""Short Treasuries will pay off when the Fed starts to hike interest rates ... they have been slow and potentially getting behind the curve.""The Fed cited turbulence in emerging markets and China as one reason for holding rates near zero in September, and weak jobs data last week has prompted market players to start betting that the first rate rise in nine years will now be delayed until March 2016.""Given we are in a 30-year low in interest rates, you don't want the duration risk and that is why we have moved our portfolio to have negative U.S. Treasury duration.

37,"   By David Randall and Chuck Mikolajczak | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Oct 13 The era of making a broad bet on mutual fund companies as a way to play America's self-funded retirement boom appears to have ended.After outpacing the market during both the 1990s and early 2000s bull runs, the stocks of standalone mutual fund companies such as T. Rowe Price Group Inc, Eaton Vance Corp  and Franklin Resources Inc have fallen behind, gaining just half the amount of the broad S&P 500 over the last five years.Analysts say there is little reason to expect a broad snapback in shares anytime soon, largely because the firms, big in the retirement space that mushroomed once 401ks and IRAs began to replace traditional pensions in the early 1980s, are now facing the flip side of those savings plans: withdrawals.Last year marked the first time that more money came out of 401(k) plans than was added, with $377 billion in withdrawals outpacing $338 billion in deposits, according to Cerulli Associates. Those declines are expected to accelerate as the baby boom generation ages.At the same time, standalone fund firms are losing assets to lower-cost and less-profitable passively managed mutual funds and exchange traded funds. Private firm Vanguard, best known for its index funds, is the world's second-largest asset manager, behind only BlackRock Inc, whose iShares line makes it the world's largest ETF provider, according to IPE Research.Even fund companies that establish their own ETFs may find themselves retaining assets by cannibalizing their own more fee-intensive funds. Adding insult to injury, fund company margins have been hurt in recent years by near-zero short-term interest rates that have prompted companies to waive fees on some funds.After selling off since peaking late in 2014, many fund companies have become cheap when compared with their historical standard and the broader S&P 500 index. T. Rowe Price's price-to-earnings ratio hit a 20-year low of 14.3 on Oct. 7 and has edged up slightly to 14.5. Franklin Resources'  forward PE stood at 12.1, up slightly from a 3-year low. As of Oct. 12, BlackRock Inc's forward PE was at a 1-year low of 15.1, even with the S&P's. In the past, these companies have had PEs in the high 20s. Thomson Reuters Starmine holds an intrinsic value of  $49.80 for Franklin Resources stock, $407.90 for BlackRock and $90.15 for T. Rowe Price, all well above their recent trading levels.TAILORED BETS Mutual fund companies still have a lot of money in their coffers. Actively managed funds oversee a total of approximately $8.1 trillion in assets, compared with $1.6 trillion invested in ETFs, according to Lipper data. But analysts and fund managers say they have to be much more selective to make money by buying shares of fund companies. Even with their depressed share prices, not every one is a bargain.Investors say it requires specific attributes - a fund lineup with a history of beating peers or a sizable money market business - to help a company expand while the broad industry slows.""Not everyone is going to be comfortable going with a completely passive approach, especially if the market continues to be volatile,"" said Stephen Biggar, an analyst at Argus Research.Judson Brooks, an analyst who works on the $17.5 billion Oakmark Fund, said his fund owns shares of T. Rowe Price - down 14 percent year to date - largely because its track record of beating its peers should continue to attract assets. The company announced in July that 76 percent of its funds outperformed their Lipper averages over the last three years, and 86 outperformed their peers over the last 10 years.""The essential element of the company is that they have been able to maintain their outperformance, and we think they have a culture where that is going to continue,"" Brooks said.Higher interest rates, meanwhile, should help the companies expand their margins. A 0.25 percent increase in interest rates would allow mutual fund companies to recoup 65 percent of fee waivers, while a 1.0 percent increase in rates would allow firms to eliminate fee waivers entirely, analysts say.T. Rowe Price waived $12.5 million in fees last quarter to maintain positive yields for investors in money market accounts, an amount roughly equal to what it spent on advertising and marketing. Once interest rates rise high enough, ending fee waivers should boost its revenues by about 1.3 percent, analysts say.Higher rates would especially help Federated Investors, which has approximately 69 percent of its $354 billion in assets under management in money market funds, said Argus' Biggar. Shares of the company are down 9.8 percent for the year to date and trade at a forward price to earnings ratio of 16.1, according to Thomson Reuters data.(Reporting by David Randall with additional reporting by Chuck Mikolajczak; Editing by Linda Stern and Dan Grebler)",2015-10-13,BEN,"Tue Oct 13, 2015 | 11:48am EDT",End of an era: Mutual fund companies no longer a market bright spot,http://www.reuters.com//article/fund-stocks-idUSL1N12C0MX20151013?type=companyNews

39,"   By Ross Kerber | BOSTON  BOSTON Nov 25 In a setback for Franklin Resources Inc that could have implications for other asset managers, a U.S. regulator declined to let the California company skip a shareholder vote over its record on climate change, according to materials provided by activists on Wednesday.The decision by a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission official should help investors pressure other big fund firms to pay more attention to climate matters, said Sonia Kowal, president of Zevin Asset Management of Boston, the lead backer of the measure at Franklin Resources.""It could be very significant in terms of follow-up effects at other companies, who have been happy not to think about these issues,"" Kowal said in an interview.A spokesman for Franklin Resources did not immediately comment. Spokespeople for the SEC did not immediately return messages.As the largest investors in most big U.S. companies, Franklin and other large mutual fund sponsors wield much influence on matters that are put to shareholder votes. In recent years, environmentalists have used these corporate elections to pressure companies to report on greenhouse gas emissions or the financial risks they could face from hotter global temperatures.Franklin and some other big mutual funds have rarely backed these measures, according to voting data analyzed by the activists,[bit.ly/1XrTVqY] a record that could face scrutiny ahead of U.N. talks on global warming in Paris. In the past Zevin, which manages about $600 million, and other Franklin Resources shareholders had sought a broad review of its voting, but regulators let the company skip such a vote on grounds the request covered ""ordinary business.""This year, Zevin narrowed the request to propose that Franklin report any incongruities between its proxy voting and its own policies, such as that climate change is part of its investment risk assessment process.In a Nov. 24 letter provided by Zevin, an SEC attorney rejected various arguments by Franklin including that the proposal covered ordinary business operations and called climate change a ""significant policy issue.""

53,"  HONG KONG Goldman Sachs has increased the probability that MSCI will include mainland Chinese shares in its indexes to 70 percent, citing recent steps taken by Beijing to remove obstacles for global money managers to invest in the country's equity markets. The U.S. bank joins a growing list of investors and brokers such as Blackrock and Franklin Templeton's Mark Mobius who have given Beijing a thumbs up in recent weeks ahead of the MSCI's decision on June 14.Goldman said on Tuesday that measures taken by authorities with respect to beneficial ownership of shares and clarifying guidelines on stock suspensions has improved the chances of inclusion to 70 percent from a coin toss in April. But inclusion is unlikely to trigger an avalanche of capital flows into China. Even a 5 percent weighting in the MSCI indexes will roughly translate into a net $15 billion in inflows into ""A"" shares, tiny in comparison to daily turnover or size.Last June MSCI decided against including ""A"" shares in the index, which is a global benchmark for some $1.5 trillion of assets, due to investment restrictions. Since then, China has addressed many of MSCI's concerns by relaxing its $81 billion Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (QFII) scheme, a quota-based foreign investment scheme, and clarifying foreign ownership rights, prompting MSCI to reconsider inclusion of ""A"" shares.Chinese stocks plunged in mid-2015 after authorities tried to crack down on rampant speculation, and markets have yet to recover. Despite Tuesday's bounce, Chinese stocks are the worst performing in Asia so far this year with the Shanghai stock market down a fifth, while the Hong Kong index is down 5 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data.

58,"  (Clarifies overweight is in Templeton global equity funds)By Kit ReesLONDON, June 16 Franklin Templeton, one of the world's largest active fund managers, is sticking to its overweight stance on UK stocks in two funds managed by its Templeton Global Equity group.The funds are skewed towards UK and Europe with holdings amounting to roughly twice the weight the regions command in the benchmark MSCI AC World index. ""Investors remain sceptical, remain on the side-lines, and we think this is an opportunity on a stock-by-stock basis to find companies that get thrown out with the bathwater,"" Dylan Ball, a portfolio manager at the Templeton Global Equity Group, told Reuters.Templeton's call on the UK makes it something of a contrarian particularly ahead of next week's Brexit vote. Brexit was the top tail risk for global fund managers leading to the UK being the most underweighted market globally, according to the latest Bank of America Merrill Lynch survey.Europe and the UK are the world's worst performing stock markets this year, each down nearly 10 percent in US dollar terms. In another non-consensus call, Templeton's Ball said the fund had bought into European banks such as France's BNP Paribas , Switzerland's Credit Suisse and Italy's UniCredit in the Templeton Growth Fund (OIEC) and Templeton Global SICAV.European financials are the worst-performing sector in Europe year-to-date, down by over 27 percent since the start of the year.""If we do get a little sniff of higher yields or a wee bit of inflation or even a return to growth or even the Fed trying to get through to a second rate hike, we think the valuations (of banks) could start to reflect an improving fundamental scenario,"" Franklin Templeton's Ball said.

67,"  * Hasenstab says strong yen reigniting deflationary pressures* Franklin Templeton favours short euro amid political risks* Says emerging markets have proved resilient* U.S. Treasuries could be vulnerable to sell-off   (Writes through)By Dhara RanasingheLONDON, Aug 31 Franklin Templeton's star fund manager Michael Hasenstab believes yen strength is ""stifling"" the Japanese economy and may be set for a reversal, while a short position on the euro is favoured in the face of political risks in the region.The yen has rallied 14 percent against the dollar  this year as worries about global growth and uncertainty about the outlook for U.S. interest rate rises prompted investors to sell the dollar and buy the safe-haven Japanese currency.""The exceptional rally in the Japanese yen is stifling the economy, and it's reigniting deflationary pressures,"" Hasenstab was quoted as saying in a release on Wednesday of a roundtable discussion of Franklin Templeton's investment team on politics, policies and market resiliency. ""In our view, the Japanese economy and policymakers will likely find it very difficult to deal with the yen at these inflated levels, so the massive yen rally appears tenuous to us and poised for a reversal.""The yen has fallen in recent days and was trading near a one-month low against the dollar on Wednesday. A slew of weak data from Japan has stoked speculation that the Bank of Japan could ease policy further next month.Hasenstab said rising populism in Europe and the U.S. contrasted with resilience in many emerging market economies and that Franklin Templeton favoured being short euro as a hedge against political risks that could continue to unfold.Britain's vote in favour of leaving the European Union sent shockwaves across the region in June, while Spain has been without a functioning government since inconclusive elections in December and June. Italy is also in the spotlight ahead of a constitutional referendum later this year. ""Europe has seen a rise in nationalism and populism that we think could draw into question the whole euro zone project,"" said Hasenstab, who is well known for profits made on a 2011 bet on Ireland's bond market after the country was bailed out.On the U.S. economy, Hasenstab said the rally in  Treasuries could reverse as quickly as the run up in prices.""As we look toward the end of the year, we have to question whether the type of U.S. government bond yields we have today make sense given rising inflation and the resiliency we've seen in the U.S. economy,"" he said. The past week has seen talk about a near-term rise in U.S. rates gain ground following hawkish comments from Federal Reserve officials. Ten-year U.S. Treasury yields are on course for their biggest monthly rise in over a year as investors continued to build up bets that the Fed will hike rates before the year is out.RESILIENT EMsHasenstab, chief investment officer at Templeton Global Macro, manages assets worth roughly $50 billion in his flagship fund. He is optimistic about emerging markets despite ructions in developed economies.He said barring a couple of exceptions such as Turkey and Venezuela, emerging markets have been relatively stable because their underlying economies have proved ""resilient"" even in the face of some slowdown in growth.""Areas that once were thought of as highly risky and vulnerable (like Mexico, Indonesia and India) have proved to be following what we view as a very consistent path that, I think, has benefited investors,"" Hasenstab added.The benchmark emerging markets stock index is up almost 13 percent this year, compared with a rise of almost 7  percent in the S&P 500.

68,"   By Huw Jones | LONDON, Sept 6  LONDON, Sept 6 A group of asset managers and banks are trying to cut the cost of ""dark pool"", or anonymous, trading in big blocks of shares via a deal with a London Stock Exchange Group unit.Dark pools, whose transactions are only revealed once they are completed to avoid unduly moving prices, have come under scrutiny from regulators who want more transparency in trading.Plato Partnership, which includes Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, AXA Investment Managers and Franklin Templeton, said it has signed the co-operation agreement with the LSE unit, Turquoise.Turquoise is 51 percent owned by the London exchange and trades shares across 19 European countries. The rest of Turquoise is held by 12 investment banks, some of whom also back Plato.""Plato Partnership's key aims remain to reduce trading costs, simplify market structure and act as a champion for end investors,"" Plato said in a statement on Tuesday. The cooperation agreement coincides with a planned merger of the London exchange and Deutsche Boerse.Britain is also due to leave the European Union and Turquoise currently uses a ""passport"" under the bloc's rules to offer cross-border share trading. LSE Group has operations in EU member Italy which could potentially be used as another base if Britain lost its passporting rights. No equity stakes are involved in the Plato-Turquoise agreement. Buy-side firms will help shape the development of Turquoise's dark pool services.The main focus is on Turquoise's ""midpoint dark order book"" which handles trades worth over 250,000 euros  ($279,000). It will be renamed Turquoise Plato.The EU will implement new curbs on dark pool trading from January 2018 but such large trades will benefit from exemptions. The new venture brings together for the first time the ""buy-side"", or funds who invest in shares, the ""sell-side"" banks who channel share orders, and a trading platform which executes those orders, Plato said.Turquoise's non-dark or lit trading service is not part of the deal.Dark pools have been accused of favouring some investors like high-speed traders, over other customers.But Plato said the new platform will seek to ensure ""the protection of orders with the goal of ensuring fairness for all participants"".

70,"   By TJ Strydom | JOHANNESBURG  JOHANNESBURG Private equity firm Bain Capital has agreed a debt for equity swap deal valued at $1.5 billion for Edcon, the chief executive of the South African clothes retailer said on Tuesday. Taken private in a highly leveraged 25 billion rand (or $3.5 billion at the time) buyout by Bain 2007, Edcon has struggled to grow at a fast enough rate to pay down debt.""We have been living beyond our means, expenditure was more than our income,"" CEO Bernie Brookes told a news conference.Under the deal, Franklin Templeton, one of the world's biggest fund managers, will become a top shareholder in Edcon, which sells brands such as Tom Taylor, Top Man and Salsa.Other owners are Standard Bank (SBKJ.J), Barclays Africa Group (BGAJ.J), FirstRand (FSRJ.J), Standard Chartered (STAN.L), Investec (INVP.L), Brigade Capital and Harvard Pension Fund.  The retailer has been grappling with an over-leveraged capital structure for several years, after troubles in its credit business in 2014 coincided with an economic slowdown and weak consumer spending in South Africa.Brookes said Edcon reached ""a catastrophic situation in March"" and had to choose between seeking protection from creditors - called business rescue in South Africa and similar to Chapter 11 in the United States - or not paying debt holders. Edcon, which vies for market share with Foschni Group, Truworths and international chains such as Zara and H&M, asked holders of two euro and-dollar denominated bonds in April to defer an interest payment to December to boost liquidity.  A 425 million euro bond - originally pitched in late 2013 as a bridge to an initial public offering - was written down last year in a distressed exchange offer that reduced the company's debt pile by 4.5 billion rand and its interest payments by 1 billion rand.Edcon had considered selling assets to shore up finances, but it attracted only ""firesale"" offers, said Brookes. Edcon announced also on Tuesday that it would sell its Legit chain to private equity group Metier for 637 million rand  ($45.95 million).  Brookes said Bain spent more than 6.4 billion rand ($461 million) in capital but had not taken out any dividends and would receive no proceeds from the deal.  Bain Capital declined to comment.In South Africa's largest private equity deal at the time, the structure of the deal required Edcon to sell high-yielding bonds just before South Africa's slipped into a recession in 2009 and shortly before the global financial crisis. With the rand currency losing half its value since 2007, Bain's investment was deep underwater and Edcon struggled to pay down foreign-currency denominated borrowings.

In the past, so-called active fund managers that aim to pick the best stock and bond performers rather than passively follow an index, would have voiced concerns to CEOs in private, if they chose to speak up at all. Public agitation has normally been the realm of activist hedge funds and a cadre of smaller funds.By voicing frustrations for all to see, large active fund managers open the door even further for other major shareholders to join the public fight and add pressure on CEOs and boards to address the proposed strategy shifts, leadership shuffles and other changes.T. Rowe Price, historically the most outspoken of the big active managers, is currently pushing Oracle Corp (ORCL.N) to improve its $9.3 billion offer for cloud storage company NetSuite Inc N.N, which expires on Friday. The fund, which manages $763 billion, has sent a detailed letter to each company and has said it will not tender its shares. The mutual funds' public efforts to wring more value out of their holdings is in part a response to the rising competition from the low-fee index-tracking funds.""You just can't follow the herd anymore. The idea of active means defending and enhancing your investment,"" said Nahum, the Neuberger portfolio manager.The more aggressive approach seems to be working for T.

Shares of Ultratech have risen 35 percent since August 2015 when Nahum sent a private letter to CEO Arthur Zafiropoulo and his management team, which kicked off the fight over the company's stock performance and its executive compensation plan, filings show. In April of this year, Neuberger, which oversees $255 billion in assets, informed the company it was nominating two board candidates. The fight was on.A Zafiropoulo representative later met with Nahum to tell him that the CEO thought the portfolio manager was a ""cockroach"" who was disrupting the company and should back off, according to people familiar with the matter. Shareholders voted Neuberger's nominees onto the board at the July annual meeting.Ultratech declined to comment on Neuberger Berman‚Äôs campaign and was unable to make Zafiropoulo available to comment on what transpired publicly or privately between him and the fund. OUTFLOW Investors have been moving away from active fund managers to index tracking funds that charge about eight times less than the active funds and yet have outperformed them by 149 basis points over the past five years, according to Thomson Reuters Lipper.   Speaking up in public risks alienating CEOs and their teams, but private dialogue, which mutual fund managers have preferred in the past, is easier to ignore than public protests.Forced to compete both against their peers and passive investors, active funds are more willing to put their access to management on the line, according to Bruce Goldfarb, the founder of proxy advisory firm Okapi Partners.

Italy holds a referendum on constitutional reform on Dec. 4 in what is shaping up to be the next major risk event for euro zone markets. Prime Minister Matteo Renzi says his plan to curb the roles of the upper house Senate and regional governments will bring greater stability to Italy and accelerate lawmaking. Critics say the changes would remove checks and balances, over-centralize power and hurt democracy. Opinion polls generally put the 'no' camp ahead.  ""The Trump win does show that populism continues in 2016 and suggests a 'no' vote in the Italian referendum could be stronger than we assumed,"" Franklin Templeton's David Zahn told Reuters. ""That is something that could become an issue for the market and something people will focus on."" Concerns about growing political uncertainty in Italy - the euro zone's third biggest economy - have weighed on Italian government bonds, which have underperformed top-rated German bonds as well as southern European peers in recent months.The gap between Italian and Spanish 10-year bond yields is trading at around 50 basis points, its widest level since the bloc's 2012 debt crisis.Zahn declined to comment on any changes in market positioning following the U.S. election results.

Rising populism globally, highlighted by Trump's win, not only puts the focus on Italy but also on elections in Germany and France next year, said Zahn.He added that Trump's election win had a number of implications for Europe as a whole.

81,"   By Yumna Mohamed  Nov 16 Increasing volatility in European fixed income markets spurred by political risk factors will continue to overshadow economic fundamentals in the coming year, Franklin Templeton's head of European fixed income said on Wednesday.David Zahn, who oversees the company's European fixed income strategies, which total over 2 billion euros ($2.2 billion), also told the Global Markets Forum that the European Central Bank's monetary policy decisions would be closely watched.Here are excerpts from the conversation:Question: We don't really know what Donald Trump's presidency will be like or what sort of Brexit we'll be getting. How can fixed income investors plan for 2017 with all this uncertainty?Answer: Politics is the most important focal point for a while and will continue to be so, but we will come back to fundamentals eventually, which is where positioning a portfolio will pay off. Q: What are your expectations over the long term for interest rates? Are we in a new era of permanently low yields?A: In Europe, we expect interest rates to remain low for a while given inflation is below the ECB's target, so not permanent, but for a while. Peripheral bonds will continue to move based on politics of the euro zone.Q: Will anything the ECB does after March have an effect? A: The ECB should extend Quantitative Easing in their December meeting and I think that will have a continued effect. The current selloff in bonds actually makes their job easier as the buying restrictions will not be as great.Q: Could you elaborate a bit more on positioning ahead of the risk events in Europe?A: Risk events in Europe are high for the next year with all the elections and Brexit of course. The ones I am most focused on are Italy and France. Our European fixed income accounts are defensively positioned since the end of September so we can look for opportunities on volatile moves. I would expect there will be movement on a repatriation of funds but we need to see the detail. Q: What are the opportunities you see ahead in the market?A: I am very constructive on European fixed income as the recent back-up in yields and divergence in individual country performance gives active portfolio managers a lot more scope to outperform in the coming year.To read more from Zahn at the Reuters Invesment Summit see(This interview was conducted in the Reuters Global Markets Forum, a chat room hosted on the Eikon platform.

82,"   By Abhinav Ramnarayan and Helen Reid | LONDON  LONDON Euro zone government bonds are starting to look attractive again after a concerted sell-off that has seen the region's benchmark German bond yield spike 50 basis points over six weeks, Franklin Templeton portfolio manager David Zahn said on Wednesday. Franklin Templeton Fixed Income Group, which turned underweight euro zone government bonds in September when yields plummeted close to record lows, is reconsidering its position after the sharp correction of recent weeks. ""You're starting to get to areas where euro zone government bonds look reasonable ‚Äì not cheap, but reasonable,"" said Zahn, who heads European fixed income for Franklin Templeton. ""Because inflation will be slightly above 1 percent next year, and we believe quantitative easing will continue, in that environment bond yields should be quite well anchored in Europe vis a vis their U.S. cousins,"" he told the Reuters Global Investment Outlook Summit.For excerpts of interview, click on [L8N1DH5TO] Euro zone government bond yields started rising in late September on concerns that the European Central Bank might slow asset purchases. The trend intensified after Republican Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election last week, pushing U.S. Treasury yields close to their highest levels this year and increasing inflation expectations globally given talk of $1 trillion in infrastructure investment. The yield on Germany's 10-year government bond DE10YT=TWEB, the region's benchmark, has risen from a Sept. 30 low of minus 0.16 percent to a high of 0.35 percent on Wednesday. Concern about rising populist and nationalist sentiment across the developed world in the wake of Trump's triumph has seen selling particularly in the debt of Italy and France, both of which face electoral tests in the near future. ""We have a lot of political uncertainty coming in Europe over the next 12 months, with focus particularly on the Italian referendum and French presidential elections,"" Zahn said. Italy's referendum on constitutional change is on Dec. 4 while the French vote is scheduled for April-May next year.  However, unlike with Britain's June vote to exit the European Union and the U.S. election, both of whose outcomes were unexpected, markets are pricing in risks around the Italian and French events, according to Zahn. Italy's 10-year spread to German equivalents is close to its highest since October 2014 at 169 basis points, while France's spread to German Bunds is close to two-year highs at 45 bps. Opinion polls are making increasingly grim reading for Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, less than three weeks before the referendum on which he has staked his political future. The risk of a populist departure from moderate, centrist government is spreading across Europe, but the ECB is still driving markets with its 80 billion euro per month asset purchase program, due to end in March 2017.""They will continue their policies, I think their new inflation forecasts will show that they will be close but not quite at their 2 percent goal in 2019,"" said Zahn. ""Our expectation is that they will extend their quantitative easing program beyond March.""

83,"  LONDON Nov 28 Bad loans in China's banking system and a risk of overleverage and regulation in Chinese real estate are reasons to remain cautious on these segments in 2017, asset manager Franklin Templeton said on Monday.""We remain cautious of China's banks as non-performing loan recognition dampens our outlook for the country's financial firms,"" Stephen Dover, chief investment officer at Templeton Emerging Markets Group and Franklin Local Asset Management, and Mark Mobius, executive chairman of Templeton Emerging Markets Group, said in a note.  They added that like banks, China's real estate sector had staged a ""striking turnaround"" from a lengthy downturn, but they had remained on the sidelines, in part due to risks of overleverage and regulation.
