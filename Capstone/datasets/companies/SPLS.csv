0,"   By Laila Kearney | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Dozens of United States Postal Service workers took to the streets of San Francisco on Tuesday in the first of a series of planned protests against expanding post office services to Staples Inc stores using non-union workers.Post office employees and mail carriers shouted from loudspeakers and held picket signs outside a busy Staples store in the city's Nob Hill neighborhood, seeking to draw attention to an arrangement they say threatens the quality of mail service to U.S. residents.The USPS and Staples agreed in October to allow Staples employees to sell postal packaging and accept mail that is later picked up from the stores by postal workers.The Postal Service has been plagued by financial troubles as more people pay their bills and communicate electronically instead of sending stamped mail, and as it struggles to pay into a health fund for its future retirees, as mandated by a 2006 law.Members of the American Postal Workers Union and the National Association of Letter Carriers said that allowing non-sworn postal workers to handle mail could cause issues including identity theft and an uptick in mismanaged parcels.""We're concerned about the safety and sanctity of the mail,"" said Omar Gonzalez, a 59-year-old post office worker from Los Angeles. Gonzalez was among roughly 100 postal workers and supporters who joined the Northern California rally. Many wore T-shirts fashioned in the dark blue color of mail drop boxes and displaying the words, ""The U.S. mail is not for sale.""Gonzalez said post office workers, concerned about layoffs and office closures, did not oppose expanding services. ""What we'd like to see is that these Staples stores are staffed with postal workers,"" he said. ""If you want to serve the American public, let us do our jobs.""SERVICE OUTSIDE NORMAL HOURS  Supporters of the Staples contract say the arrangement makes it easier for people to access postal services.""It has been received well, and customers like the convenience,"" USPS spokesman Don Smeraldi said.Smeraldi said the deal with Staples was made to save customers time and allow them to receive services outside normal post office hours. He said the agency, which has contracted out services to private companies before, has addressed the mail safety concerns by giving special training to the employees staffing the Staples postal stations. Smeraldi said the program was also aimed at generating revenue for USPS, which has reported taking aggressive cost-cutting measures, including a drastic reduction in employee hours.A Staples spokesman declined to comment on the protests or the contract with USPS.""We are currently operating a pilot program in select stores that is testing specific services and offering added convenience for our customers,"" Staples spokesman Kirk Saville said in an emailed statement. ""As a matter of policy, we don't provide details on our pilot programs or on our agreements with vendors.""The yearlong pilot program was launched in 82 Staples stores in California, Georgia, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. USPS intends to expand the service to more Staples locations, Smeraldi said.Following the San Francisco rally, protesters said they would gather in San Jose late Tuesday afternoon.

11,"  (Adds analysts' comments on gaming and FireTV, graphics)By Jennifer Saba and Deepa SeetharamanNEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO, April 2 Amazon.com Inc  made a play for the increasingly crowded home entertainment arena by unveiling the $99 ""Fire TV"" video and game streaming device on Wednesday, with hopes of boosting its main online retail business over the longer term.The square device, which just about fits in the palm of one hand, streams content from Netflix Inc, Hulu and other video services - much like Apple TV or Google Inc's  Chromecast.It also offers a prominent platform for Amazon's own fast-growing streaming video service as well as its growing slate of original television programs and games. Amazon will also sell a separate controller for gaming that costs $39.99.Amazon, which has been building its multimedia presence to tap the growing appetite for digital media, is now jumping headlong into the heated competition for consumers' attention and an estimated $70 billion TV ad market. It took the wraps off the Fire TV at a rare Apple-style media event in New York.Analysts were split on Amazon's prospects. Some said its strategy to pitch the Fire TV as an option for casual gamers would set the box apart. Others were disappointed Amazon did not undercut its rivals' prices in keeping with its pricing strategy on the original Kindle Fire tablet.""They created a product we didn't need,"" said Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter.The Fire TV competes in a market that is set to grow by 24 percent this year, Strategy Analytics said. But that's off a low base: streaming boxes have still not made much of a splash, partly because game consoles from Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo -- not to mention ""smart"" TVs and DVD players -- already stream Netflix and other popular services. Tech leaders from Microsoft Corp to Apple Inc are vying for space on the TV, the traditional family entertainment center and where Americans used to spend most of their leisure time. That has changed with the advent of the smartphone and tablet.The device is one of several initiatives by Amazon, one of the world's largest online retailers, to play a central role in how consumers shop and spend their leisure time. Its projects range from building more warehouses to expand its same-day delivery service to developing original television shows such as the political comedy ""Alpha House"" starring John Goodman.If Fire TV takes off, it could help shape the way consumers shop online. Fire TV viewers may eventually be able to use their remote to buy a product directly off a commercial, analysts said, as Amazon's multimedia and online retail businesses become even more integrated.""The company will eventually want to help you buy things in the living room,"" Forrester Research analyst James McQuivey said. ""Only Amazon can piece that entire experience together in the living room and though we don't see evidence of that ambition here today, we should assume Amazon knows this and is planning on it."" While the company tried to one-up existing streaming boxes with voice-activation and a line-up of games from publishers like Electronic Arts and Walt Disney Co, some remained doubtful the Fire TV will make waves upon debut.JOHNNY COME LATELY Amazon's biggest previous foray into tech hardware -- the Kindle e-reader -- succeeded because it was an early entrant in a nascent market. But the Fire TV is a latecomer to two markets that rivals had fought over for years -- gaming and home entertainment. Amazon has to wedge itself into a market split fairly evenly between various nascent technologies, all of which are challenging cable companies' traditional death-grip on TV viewing.But the company promised however that Fire TV, available now on Amazon.com, would be faster and easier to use than Apple TV, Google's Chromecast or Roku Inc's streaming video device.It can predict what the user will watch and cue it up, Kindle unit vice president Peter Larsen said. It also has a feature that uses data from IMDB to identify the music on screen as well as the actors and their filmography as they exit and enter the screen on TV.""When we look at the living room, how do we make the complexity disappear?"" Larsen said at a rare, Apple-style New York product launch event.Fire TV's remote features a microphone that enables voice-activated search. Fire TV is integrated with Hulu Plus so users can see Amazon shows from their Hulu account, and Amazon said it may bring in other partners soon.By next month, Fire TV users will be able to play thousands of video games. Amazon decided to develop the device after reading customer complaints on its website about lagging performance, cumbersome search and closed ""ecosystems"" on rival set-top boxes.Shares in Amazon ended down 0.3 percent at $341.96 on Nasdaq.

12,"  Clippers top Nuggets, set franchise win markLOS ANGELES -- Close to capping their best regular season ever, the Los Angeles Clippers say it would mean little if they don't make a deep run into the NBA playoffs.Forward Blake Griffin scored 24 points and point guard Chris Paul added 21 points and 10 assists, leading the Clippers to a 117-105 romp over the Denver Nuggets on Tuesday night at Staples Center.The Clippers (57-24) set a franchise record for wins in a season, topping last season's mark of 56. They also completed their best run at home, finishing 34-7.""We were a part of that last year, at least me and Blake were, and we lost in the first round, so it's all good and well, but I think we're at a point now it's all about the postseason,"" Paul said.Added Clippers coach Doc Rivers, ""It's nice, don't get me wrong. I'm happy that we're doing this stuff, but it's not what we want. To get what you want, sometimes you get other stuff, I guess, is the best way to say it. Like I said before the game, winning the division is part of the stuff you get in the march to what you really want.""Los Angeles ends its regular-season march against the Trail Blazers on Wednesday night. The Clippers, currently in the No. 3 position in the Western Conference, could rise to No. 2 if they earn a win at Portland and the Oklahoma City Thunder lose at home to the Detroit Pistons. However, that too seemed to matter little to the Clippers. Griffin probably won't play in Portland after picking up his 16th technical foul of the season, generating an automatic one-game suspension if it isn't rescinded.""It doesn't matter anyway,"" Rivers said. ""Worst case he's suspended for one game, but we're not going to bring him tomorrow anyways.""The technical was called at 3:23 of the second period, but it factored little in the outcome. Paul set the tone early, sparking the Clippers to a 13-0 lead three minutes into the contest. He scored 13 of his 17 first-half points in the first quarter, staking Los Angeles to a 38-26 heading into the second. The Clippers led by as much as 19 in the first half before taking a 63-46 lead into intermission. Paul hit six of eight shots, including three of five 3-pointers, in 18 minutes during the opening half.Denver closed within 89-84 on a jumper by forward Jan Vesely in the opening minutes of the final period, but Los Angeles' reserves kept the Nuggets at bay.""This was a good win for us tonight,"" said Paul, who might be held out of the Portland game, too. Denver (36-45) fell for the fourth consecutive time to the Clippers at Staples.""They have chemistry,"" said Nuggets guard Randy Foye, who scored 11 points, handed out seven assists and recorded four steals. ""They've built chemistry over the years. Chris Paul is obviously the engine that makes them go. Blake Griffin is right there, neck and neck with him. They have chemistry together, and it's going to be hard to beat them (in the playoffs).""Rivers sat Griffin, Paul and guard J.J. Redick in the fourth quarter. Redick scored 18 points, hitting four of six 3-point attempts. Clippers center DeAndre Jordan finished with 13 points and 16 rebounds.All five Denver starters scored in double figures, led by forward Kenneth Faried, who had 21 points. Guard Aaron Brooks finished with 19 points, while center Timofey Mozgov had 18 points and 11 rebounds.""We were rattled at the beginning of the game,"" Denver coach Brian Shaw said. ""We couldn't settle down and they jumped out to that big lead, and it was just too much for us.""NOTES: Injured Clippers F Danny Granger may return to practice Thursday or Friday, coach Doc Rivers said. If so, Granger could be ready for the playoffs this weekend. Granger missed his eighth consecutive game Tuesday due to a strained left hamstring. ... Rivers will rest G J.J. Redick, who has endured an assortment of injuries this season, when the Clippers visit the Portland Trail Blazers on Wednesday. ... Denver coach Brian Shaw identified C Timofey Mozgov as the club's biggest surprise this season. ""I feel like he's a diamond in the rough. He brings a lot of things to the table,"" Shaw said. ... Nuggets F Anthony Randolph sat out his second game in a row for personal reasons. ...

19,"   By Siddharth Cavale  Staples Inc (SPLS.O) forecast a fall in sales in the current quarter as customers shift to e-retailers, mass merchants and drugstores to buy their office supplies, and the company reported its weakest quarterly gross margins since May 2003.Shares of the largest U.S. office supply retailer fell as much as 13 percent on Tuesday, after the company also reported its fifth straight decline in quarterly sales.Staples has been stocking more electronics such as tablets and offering copy and print services as demand wanes for traditional office supplies such as paper and printer toner.Facing competition from mass merchants such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) and online retailers such as Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Staples has been spending more on its online business and on advertising to create awareness that it sells more than traditional office supplies.The increased investment, along with mark-downs to clear inventory, pushed down gross margins in the first quarter to 24.94 percent from 25.98 percent a year earlier.The company said it expected stepped-up investments in e-commerce and marketing to continue to weigh on profit in the current quarter. Staples forecast earnings of 9-14 cents per share for the quarter ending August 3, falling short of the average analyst forecast of 15 cents per share.The company said store closures and weak demand would result in a decline in sales in the current quarter, compared with a year earlier, but did to provide a figure. Staples reported sales of $5.32 billion in the second quarter of 2013.Analysts are expecting second-quarter sales of $5.18 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Staples said in March it would close 140 of its 1,846 stores in North America this year to boost profits and focus on its online business.""We think the company is taking the right steps, including aggressively closing stores this year ...,"" Deutsche Bank Markets Research analyst Mike Baker wrote in a note, maintaining a ""hold"" rating on the stock.First-quarter sales fell nearly 3 percent to $5.65 billion. North America sales rose just 1 percent as a fall in sales of core office supplies offset most of the benefit of a rise in sales of breakroom supplies and furniture. International sales fell 4 percent.""While sales were better than expectations, profitability remains a question mark within the retail business ...

20,"  (Adds details on margins and sales; updates shares)By Siddharth CavaleMay 20 Staples Inc forecast a fall in sales in the current quarter as customers shift to e-retailers, mass merchants and drugstores to buy their office supplies, and the company reported its weakest quarterly gross margins since May 2003.Shares of the largest U.S. office supply retailer fell as much as 13 percent on Tuesday, after the company also reported its fifth straight decline in quarterly sales.Staples has been stocking more electronics such as tablets and offering copy and print services as demand wanes for traditional office supplies such as paper and printer toner.Facing competition from mass merchants such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc and online retailers such as Amazon.com Inc , Staples has been spending more on its online business and on advertising to create awareness that it sells more than traditional office supplies.The increased investment, along with mark-downs to clear inventory, pushed down gross margins in the first quarter to 24.94 percent from 25.98 percent a year earlier. The company said it expected stepped-up investments in e-commerce and marketing to continue to weigh on profit in the current quarter.Staples forecast earnings of 9-14 cents per share for the quarter ending Aug. 3, falling short of the average analyst forecast of 15 cents per share.The company said store closures and weak demand would result in a decline in sales in the current quarter, compared with a year earlier, but did to provide a figure. Staples reported sales of $5.32 billion in the second quarter of 2013. Analysts are expecting second-quarter sales of $5.18 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Staples said in March it would close 140 of its 1,846 stores in North America this year to boost profits and focus on its online business.""We think the company is taking the right steps, including aggressively closing stores this year ...,"" Deutsche Bank Markets Research analyst Mike Baker wrote in a note, maintaining a ""hold"" rating on the stock. First-quarter sales fell nearly 3 percent to $5.65 billion. North America sales rose just 1 percent as a fall in sales of core office supplies offset most of the benefit of a rise in sales of breakroom supplies and furniture.International sales fell 4 percent.""While sales were better than expectations, profitability remains a question mark within the retail business ...

55,"   By Deepa Seetharaman | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Dec 26 Major U.S. retailers missed fewer Christmas deliveries this year, according to two small, early surveys released on Friday, partly reflecting a year's worth of investments made to avoid 2013's last-minute shipping debacle.This year, 7 percent of packages ordered online did not arrive by their promised delivery date, compared with 12 percent in 2013, according to a survey of 160 orders placed by retail-intelligence firm StellaService.Separately, management consulting firm Kurt Salmon said 13 percent of the nearly 100 e-commerce orders it surveyed did not make it in time for Christmas, down from 15 percent in 2013.In 2013, some 2 million express packages were left stranded on Christmas Eve, according to shipment-tracking software developer ShipMatrix Inc. The reasons given were, in part, a surge in demand triggered by last-minute online promotions and bad weather.This year, retailers pushed back the cut-off date for Christmas delivery by one day, but most were still able to hit the mark because of improvements to their logistics infrastructure, better weather and fewer last-minute deals. ""We saw a lot less of the 11th-hour promotions,"" said Steve Osburn, director of supply chain for Kurt Salmon. ""They may have extended their deadline by about a day, but they were a little less aggressive about pushing those promotions.""Retailers set a Christmas cut-off delivery date between Dec. 19 and Dec. 20 this year, he said. The four retailers with the most aggressive cutoff date of Dec. 23 - Apple Inc, Dell Inc, Nordstrom Inc and Zappos, a unit of Amazon.com Inc - all made their deadlines, StellaService said.The better results also stemmed from the heavy investments by United Parcel Service Inc and FedEx Corp, the world's two largest shipping companies. UPS allocated $500 million to expand and improve its 2014 holiday operations. Both built new facilities, added more temporary workers and pushed retailers for clearer estimates and earlier deadlines to avoid last year's missteps.The level of communication between carriers and retailers was ""significantly higher"" this year, Osburn said, pointing to a retail client who, in the run-up to Christmas, heard from one carrier two to three times a day. But both surveys found that some retailers still fell short of their promises, reflecting the difficulty of accurately calculating holiday demand as e-commerce orders grow rapidly.StellaService found nine of the top 40 retailers it tested missed delivery dates: Best Buy Co Inc, Costco Wholesale Corp, Crate & Barrel, J.C. Penney Co Inc, Kohl's Corp , Macy's Inc, Staples Inc, Toys 'R Us and Wayfair Inc.Best Buy declined to comment. The other retailers were not immediately available for comment.Both Staples and Toys 'R Us missed deliveries in multiple regions in the United States, and in one case, Staples canceled an order without notifying the shopper, StellaService said.Osburn found one case where a retailer fell behind on orders and attempted to upgrade shipping on packages to make the Christmas deadline. But the volume was three to four times higher than its previous estimates, and the retailer missed the Christmas deadline, Osburn said, declining to name the company.

75,"   By Reynolds Holding | NEW YORK  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Staples' $6.3 billion takeover of Office Depot could slide through the antitrust checkout line. Crunching together the two largest U.S. office supply chains is a financial winner: the value of the synergies alone almost pays for the entire deal. And though trustbusters may squawk, even they acknowledge that, with internet and big box stores thriving, the competitive landscape has changed.The companies say they expect annual cost savings of $1 billion by the third year after the stock-and-cash deal closes. That's worth about $6 billion to shareholders today, assuming a 35 percent tax rate. It also makes the $11 per share price for Office Depot, a roughly 44 percent premium over the company's Monday close, easy to swallow.The trick will be getting regulators to sign off. Staples and Office Depot are, respectively, the No. 1 and No. 2 brick-and-mortar players in the office products retail space. And the Federal Trade Commission bounced a proposed deal between them in 1997.Since then, Amazon and other online retailers have snatched away reams of business, while the Wal-Mart Stores  of the world give consumers often cheaper offline options. These industry developments persuaded the FTC to approve Office Depot's 2013 acquisition of OfficeMax without requiring any store closures.The bigger worry may be business and government purchasers. They typically agree to buy in bulk over several years in exchange for deep discounts. Trustbusters will be scrutinizing whether the merger would ease the pressure to compete for the biggest discount. It's a legitimate concern. Amazon recently rolled out a separate site aimed at businesses, but sellers like Costco lack the national distribution of a combined Staples-Office Depot.And if anything, federal antitrust regulators have gotten even tougher. After failing to deliver on President Barack Obama's first-term promise to crack down on anticompetitive deals, enforcers have been more than eager to challenge mergers between the likes of US Airways and American Airlines  parent AMR Corp. Staples and Office Depot seem to think that won't happen here, though. Their agreement calls for Staples to pay a termination fee of $250 million if trustbusters squelch the deal - low for a transaction of this size. Considering all the new places to buy pens, paper and staplers, their confidence is probably justified.CONTEXT NEWS -  Staples, the largest U.S. office supplies chain, announced on Feb. 4 that it had agreed to buy Office Depot, the number two retailer, for $6.3 billion.

79,"   By Nathan Layne  Wal-Mart Stores Inc's wage hike will likely trigger a rethink on pay across the retail and fast-food sectors, with Target Corp one of the low-wage employers facing pressure to follow suit and pay workers more.Wal-Mart announced on Thursday it would lift its minimum U.S. wage to $9 an hour this year and $10 in 2016, raising the ante in a tightening labor market where low-skilled workers easily move between retailers and fast-food chains.Labor and shareholder activists will likely use the news to ratchet up pressure on companies which have so far faced less scrutiny than Wal-Mart, the largest private U.S. employer with a workforce of 1.3 million.   “This is the largest retailer out there so I think others are going to have to follow,” said Brian Yarbrough, analyst at Edward Jones, naming Target and Staples Inc among other national retailers that may look to revise their pay scales. ""All the restaurants are going to be under pressure as well.”When Gap Inc a year ago set its minimum wage at $9 an hour and pledged to go to $10 in 2015, many workers at Wal-Mart sought to switch and secure employment at the apparel retailer, according to Burt Flickinger, managing director of Strategic Resource Group, a retail industry consultancy.Now, Wal-Mart's move should help it reduce turnover and will likely put the most direct pressure on Target, given that their pay scales for entry-level positions are generally close and there is broad overlap in product lines. ""It's absolutely Target,"" Flickinger said when asked what rival would likely need to take action to retain staff.Target spokeswoman Molly Snyder said the company was ""committed to offering market competitive wages that can help attract and retain great talent."" She said Target pays above the federal minimum wage of $7.25 at all of its stores, but does not disclose its average rate.Wal-Mart said the hikes would lift the average hourly wage this year for full-time employees to $13 from $12.85, while raising the average for part-time staff to $10 from $9.48. Those rates could go higher in 2016. Data from employer review site Glassdoor based on at least 75 responses shows that Target, Wal-Mart and Staples are roughly paying the same hourly rate, with cashiers and sales associates making around $9 an hour. A cashier at McDonald's Corp, by comparison, was averaging $8.44, the data shows.  Staples and McDonald's did not immediately respond to requests for comment.It's not just wages. Wal-Mart also said it planned to make the scheduling of hours more predictable, taking a step towards addressing an issue that has long been a source of worker frustration. Labor groups and institutional investors have long targeted Wal-Mart on wages and now appear set to widen their scope. David Schilling, senior program director for human rights at the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, said investors would use the Wal-Mart wage hike as leverage when negotiating changes at other firms.   ""It's not just the retail sector. It could be fast food, restaurant workers,"" said Schilling. When it's ""a big player like Wal-Mart the ripples go forward.""

Forward Al-Farouq Amini contributed 10 points and 10 rebounds, and Chandler grabbed nine rebounds. Point guard Rajon Rondo finished with 11 points, 11 assists and eight rebounds.The Mavericks now have their immediate sights on winning 50 games, something they can accomplish Monday night at Utah against the Jazz or Wednesday at home in their regular-season finale against the Portland Trail Blazers.""It would be good. It's always good to win 50 games in a successful season,"" said Chandler, who hit nine of 10 shots from the floor. ""We want to be playing great basketball going into the playoffs.""Chandler's play is one of the reasons the Mavericks are thriving. ""He one of the real big-time difference-makers in this league,"" Dallas coach Rick Carlisle said. ""When he is healthy, there are very few guys that are better at what he does, if any. It's great to see him moving the way he is right now, and we have to take this good health mojo that we have and try to carry it into Wednesday night when we're home and finish the season out the right way.""Dallas, which has the No. 7 seed locked up for the Western Conference playoffs, defeated the Lakers for the seventh consecutive game, including the past three at Staples, and swept the season series for the second year in a row.Point guard Jordan Clarkson had 26 points and six assists to pace the Lakers (21-59). Center Tarik Black scored 10 points and pulled down a career-high 19 rebounds for Los Angeles, which fell for the sixth time in seven games.

They moved the ball well and they made shots.""The Mavericks led 62-57 at the break thanks to a 32-20 edge over the Lakers on points in the paint and a 15-2 advantage on fastbreak points.

Barea gave the Mavericks a seven-point cushion heading into the final period.Los Angeles never got any closer in the fourth quarter as the Mavericks pulled away.""Against a very good basketball team, we played some good, hard-nosed basketball,"" Lakers coach Byron Scott said. ""We hung in there. They're a very high-powered offensive team.""Lakers forward Wesley Johnson scored 16 first-half points on 6-of-9 shooting, making four of five from 3-point range, but he didn't return after intermission due to a moderate sprain of his left ankle.

""I like what he's done and how he's adjusted. And I like how our team has adjusted to his abilities,"" Carlisle said. ... PG Jeremy Lin is done for the season and could have played his last game in a Lakers uniform. Lin missed the previous three games with a sore left knee, and coach Byron Scott said Sunday that Lin, who will be a free agent at the end of the season, wouldn't play in the club's final two contests. ...

108,"   By Yashaswini Swamynathan  Office supplies retailer Staples Inc (SPLS.O) has agreed with the Federal Trade Commission to extend the review period for its $6.3 billion takeover of Office Depot Inc (ODP.O).The regulator will decide on the deal by Dec. 8, the companies said on Monday.The extension follows EU regulators launching an investigation into the deal last month, warning that it could lead to price hikes.Some analysts said they believed the extension was a positive sign. ""We...wonder if the FTC would bother agreeing to an extension if it was dead set on blocking the deal,"" BB&T Capital Markets analyst Anthony Chukumba wrote in a note.Staples first tried to buy Office Depot in 1996, but U.S. regulators blocked the transaction in 1997.  The extension gives the companies more time to negotiate ""deal remedies,"" including the potential divestiture of large delivery accounts, said Chukumba, who is rated five out of five by Thomson Reuters for his coverage of the companies.Given that ""these accounts are by far the least profitable for the office supply retailers,"" the deal will be highly accretive to Staples' earnings even after significant divestitures, he said. Telsey Advisory Group analyst Joseph Feldman said he saw a 60-65 percent chance of the FTC approving the deal, ""a little below"" his estimate six months ago.  If the FTC asks the companies to give up some customers in the units that sell to other businesses, ""it could be a deal-breaker for both Staples and Office Depot,"" he said.

109,"  * FTC to decide on deal by Dec. 8* Some analysts view extension as positive   (Adds analysts' comments, shares)By Yashaswini SwamynathanOct 12 Office supplies retailer Staples Inc  has agreed with the Federal Trade Commission to extend the review period for its $6.3 billion takeover of Office Depot Inc.The regulator will decide on the deal by Dec. 8, the companies said on Monday.The extension follows EU regulators launching an investigation into the deal last month, warning that it could lead to price hikes.Some analysts said they believed the extension was a positive sign. ""We...wonder if the FTC would bother agreeing to an extension if it was dead set on blocking the deal,"" BB&T Capital Markets analyst Anthony Chukumba wrote in a note.Staples first tried to buy Office Depot in 1996, but U.S. regulators blocked the transaction in 1997.The extension gives the companies more time to negotiate ""deal remedies,"" including the potential divestiture of large delivery accounts, said Chukumba, who is rated five out of five by Thomson Reuters for his coverage of the companies. Given that ""these accounts are by far the least profitable for the office supply retailers,"" the deal will be highly accretive to Staples' earnings even after significant divestitures, he said.Telsey Advisory Group analyst Joseph Feldman said he saw a 60-65 percent chance of the FTC approving the deal, ""a little below"" his estimate six months ago.If the FTC asks the companies to give up some customers in the units that sell to other businesses, ""it could be a deal-breaker for both Staples and Office Depot,"" he said. The companies said on Aug. 28 that they had submitted additional information to the FTC and agreed to not close the transaction for at least 45 days.Jefferies analyst Daniel Binder said his checks suggested privately held office supplies retailer WB Mason had not been approached in connection with the deal.Amazon.com Inc, W W Grainger Inc and United Stationers Inc - which has been renamed Essendant Inc - could be possible buyers of the companies' divested businesses, although Staples ""would cringe at the thought of escorting Amazon into the business,"" he wrote in a note.The deal has been approved by regulators in China, Australia and New Zealand.Staples shares were down 1 percent at $12.25 in afternoon trading on Monday, while Office Depot shares were down 1.6 percent at $6.57.

123,"   By Daniel Trotta | HAVANA  HAVANA Dec 7 Cuban and U.S. officials on Tuesday will begin to untangle one of the most complex obstacles to normalization of relations between the two countries: the claims of Americans whose property was nationalized after the 1959 revolution and Cuban counterclaims for damages caused by the U.S. trade embargo.The talks in Havana are the latest in a series of bilateral meetings since the two former Cold War adversaries restored diplomatic ties in July this year.Some 5,913 U.S. corporations and individuals have been awarded $1.9 billion worth of claims for factories, farms, homes and other assets that were nationalized in Cuba after Fidel Castro's rebels came to power on Jan. 1, 1959.Those claims, registered with the U.S. Justice Department's Foreign Claims Settlement Commission, are now worth roughly $8 billion when including 6.0 percent annual interest. Cuban law ties the settlement of the claims to U.S. reparations for damages resulting from the embargo and other acts of U.S. aggression against Cuba. Cuban estimates of that damage range from $121 billion to more than $300 billion.Neither side is eager to pay the full value, setting up a negotiation.""The meeting is the first step in what we expect to be a long and complex process, but the United States views the resolution of outstanding claims as a top priority for normalization,"" the U.S. State Department said in a statement on Monday. Cuba nationalized all foreign businesses and reached settlements with owners from other countries. The government recognizes the U.S. claims but it cut off negotiations in response to the decision by former President Dwight Eisenhower to suspend Cuba's sugar quota in 1960.The claims sat dormant for half a century as a result of the U.S.-Cuba estrangement, which ended a year a ago when U.S. President Barack Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro announced detente. Many of the nationalized companies no longer exist and individual claims have been passed to heirs.The largest claim, by the Cuban Electric Company for more than $267 million, has changed hands several times due to mergers and acquisitions and is held by Office Depot, itself a takeover target of Staples Inc pending antitrust review.With interest that claim is now worth more than $1 billion.Other major claimants include Starwood Hotels, Coca-Cola, the former International Telephone & Telegraph Co., now ITT Corp, and various oil, sugar and financial interests.

127,"   By Jonathan Schwarzberg | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Office supply company Staples Inc's US$2.75bn term loan backing the US$6.3bn acquisition of fellow retailer Office Depot Inc will remain in place through Feb 4, 2016, as planned, even though the Federal Trade Commission filed a complaint on Monday challenging the merger due to antitrust concerns, sources said. The loan commitments had been scheduled to expire on Nov 4 before being extended to Feb 4, 2016, which would be a year after the takeover plan was announced, and then would terminate if the acquisition has not been completed, according to US Securities and Exchange Commission filings.If the deal is not completed, Staples will be responsible for commitment fees that could reach almost US$100m if the commitments are kept in place through the Feb 4 deadline. Staples said it anticipates commitment fees will total between US$25m and US$35m during the fourth quarter and has already paid US$56m.Staples on Monday said in a statement that it plans to fight the Federal Trade Commission's objection, noting that it has already agreed to divest more than US$500m of commercial contracts to a competitor to help address concerns.Staples could extend the loan commitment deadline again, but that would require a modification to the agreement and the approval of the lenders. The company has not yet made a formal request to lenders at this time, sources said. Staples did not immediately return a call for comment.Staples announced the Office Depot acquisition on Feb 4 and priced in April the US$2.75bn six-year term loan alongside a US$3bn five-year asset-based lending (ABL) facility to support the deal. The ABL facility will replace the company's existing US$1bn revolving credit facility.The issuer said at the time of the deal that it plans to borrow US$1.5bn on the ABL facility when the acquisition closes. The covenant-lite term loan priced at 275bp over Libor with a 0.75% floor after guidance opened at 350bp over Libor.The loan includes a ticking fee that kicked in on May 1 at a rate of 50% of the margin. The ticking fee increased to the full margin plus the Libor floor on June 1, where it will remain. A ticking fee insures that banks get paid for providing the commitments even if a deal does not get completed.Pricing on ABL facility borrowings opened at 175bp over Libor for the first three months. After that point, pricing was tied to the amount outstanding and ranges from 125bp to 175bp over Libor. Pricing on the undrawn portion ranges form 25bp to 37.5bp over Libor. Barclays acted as the administrative agent and was joined by joint bookrunners Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and HSBC.The company also plans to use US$2.1bn of equity and US$500m of cash from its balance sheet to pay for Office Depot.Framingham, Massachusetts-based Staples previously tried to purchase Office Depot in 1997 when the pair of companies reached an agreement, but regulators forced the cancellation of the deal then due to antitrust concerns.Office Depot is based in Boca Raton, Florida.

""We just had to relax a little bit, get some stops on the defensive end and just play our brand of basketball, and we did that tonight.""Center Dwight Howard, who was loudly booed again by Lakers fans still bitter over Howard's decision to spurn Los Angeles for Houston almost two years ago, scored 16 points and grabbed 15 rebounds despite experiencing foul trouble throughout the contest.Forward Terrence Jones had 13 of his 16 points in the second half, and forward Trevor Ariza and guard Patrick Beverley chipped in 13 apiece as the Rockets (13-14) ended a two-game slide.Houston also defeated Los Angeles for the fifth consecutive time at Staples.""We relied on our defense to win the game,"" said Harden, who managed to hit just seven of 24 shots from the floor and only two of nine from beyond the 3-point arc.Bryant, who made nine of 16 shots, including a pair of 3-pointers, scored 22 points and had eight rebounds for the Lakers (4-22), who lost for the seventh time in their past eight games.

The Lakers never recovered.""We had a stretch to start the second quarter where we allowed them to get back in the game, but other than that, we put together run after run and we just continued to do things that we needed to do,"" Rockets interim coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. ""We got stops. We were aggressive on our pick-and-roll coverages. We defensive-rebounded the ball well. I think it was progress.""The Lakers resorted to intentionally fouling Howard with 5:21 left in the contest, but Howard converted seven of 12 free throws to finish 10-for-18 at the line. Bryant provided some crowd-pleasing moments in the third quarter. He had Lakers fans roaring and on their feet after he drove the lane for a dunk over forward Clint Capela.""That was his first dunk?"" Howard asked reporters. ""Aw, dang.

Ariza, who won a championship with Bryant and the Lakers in 2009, wasn't surprised by his former teammate's play.""When you have a player like that, when he gets hot, there's nothing you can really do,"" said Ariza, who guarded Bryant and carried on a dialogue with him throughout.

133,"  Kings halt Clippers' 10-game win streakLOS ANGELES -- The Los Angeles Clippers' 10-game winning streak is history.Forward DeMarcus Cousins had 19 points, 13 rebounds and six assists as the Sacramento Kings ended the Clippers' run with a 110-103 victory on Saturday night at Staples Center.""To come in their house and get a win like this is good for us,"" said Cousins, who had 15 points in the first half.Forward Rudy Gay had 18 points and seven rebounds, and forward Omri Casspi and guard Darren Collison came off the bench to add 17 points apiece for the Kings (17-23), who snapped a five-game skid against Los Angeles. Guards Ben McLemore and Rajon Rondo had 15 and 13 points, respectively. Rondo also had 10 assists and seven rebounds.The Clippers, who were again without center DeAndre Jordan (pneumonia) and forward Blake Griffin (partially torn left quad tendon), hadn't lost since falling 100-99 to the Oklahoma City Thunder on Dec. 21. ""We felt we had an advantage going into the game, especially with their bigs out, so we wanted to take advantage of it and get the ball into the paint,"" Rondo said. ""(Cousins) was able to find guys on the perimeter. He did a great job of passing the ball. We passed the ball great as a team, and we got the win.""Guard J.J. Redick scored 22 points, hitting five 3-pointers, to lead the Clippers (26-14). Center Cole Aldrich finished with 19 points and 10 rebounds and guard Jamal Crawford had 20 points. Point guard Chris Paul, who was in foul trouble throughout the night, chipped in 15 points and seven assists.""We don't want to take anything away from them, they played great,"" said Paul, who managed just 4-of-11 shooting from the floor but hit 3 of 5 3-pointers in 27 minutes. ""They made shots, they moved the ball well. We knew coming in to this game that they were a high-scoring team and we never slowed them down."" Crawford's jumper pulled Los Angeles within 100-95 with 3:52 remaining. After the teams exchanged baskets, a steal by forward Paul Pierce led to a reverse layup by Aldrich with 1:26 remaining, cutting the margin to three. But Rondo's jumper 13 seconds later pushed the Kings' cushion back to five.Two foul shots by Paul with 1:01 left allowed the Clippers to close within 104-101. However, Los Angeles couldn't convert a Rondo turnover as Pierce's 3-pointer to tie the score was off the mark. Gay hit one of two free throws with 15.9 seconds left for a four-point Kings lead, but Aldrich's dunk with 13.1 seconds remaining made it 105-103 in Sacramento's favor.Collison made two foul shots with 11.9 seconds left, and after Rondo stole Pierce's inbounds pass, he added two foul shots to seal the win.""It is tough because Cousins is their focal point, but when he starts making plays, passing to guys and getting them open shots because he commands a lot of attention, it makes them a much better team and tougher opponent,"" said Crawford, who was 8 of 17 from the floor and 3 of 7 from 3-point range. ""Obviously, we will watch the tape and see how we can improve.""The Kings used a 13-0 surge to rally from a six-point deficit for a 54-47 advantage after a three-point play by Collison with 3:13 left in the second quarter. Collison scored 12 of his 13 first-half points in the second quarter as Sacramento led 64-60 at the break.""It's a quality win for us,"" Rondo said. ""It's a roller-coaster season for us, but for us to put two games together in a row, get some rest the next couple of days and hopefully do the same thing (Wednesday) against the Lakers.""NOTES: Clippers C DeAndre Jordan (pneumonia) is improving physically, but his availability for Monday's game at Staples Center against the Houston Rockets is unknown. ...

136,"   By Kristen Haunss and Jonathan Schwarzberg | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Investors are threatening not to fund a US$2.75bn loan backing office supply retailer Staples’ purchase of rival Office Depot after pricing moved against the deal, which could delay the completion of an acquisition already challenged by antitrust issues.Banks committed to the financing, which includes the US$2.75bn term loan and a US$3bn revolving credit facility, in February 2015. When the deal was unable to be completed in a timely manner, that commitment was extended to February 4 from November 4, 2015 after the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) raised antitrust concerns.Market conditions have deteriorated since the deal was put in place and loan pricing has increased significantly in the interim, which is leading some investors to call for higher pricing. The issue highlights the risk of committing to fund loans in advance of deals closing in volatile markets, sources said.Lead arranger Barclays asked investors on a conference call to fund the loan into an escrow account on February 2 before the financing is due to mature on the original terms, which are below current market rates. The call on January 20 was described as “contentious.”Changes, including possibly increasing pricing, may be made to the financing following the strong market reaction, but nothing has been announced yet, sources said. Although investors have committed to provide financing, they argue they did not commit to funding the loan into an escrow account before the transaction received regulatory approval. With the February 4 commitment deadline fast approaching, some investors say they should be in negotiations to extend the maturity of their commitment.The term loan is rated Baa2/BBB and was sold to investors at 275bp over Libor with a 75bp floor in April, sources said. The average yield for an investment-grade loan on January 20 was 350bp; 50bp higher than the market was in April of last year, according to Thomson Reuters LPC data. The loan will be sold at 99.5bp when it is funded into escrow and may only be repaid at par, sources said.If the merger had already received regulatory approval and was due to be completed, investors would be prepared to fund the loan at 275bp, even if it is below current market rates, because they committed to the terms last year, sources said. Investors are already being paid, receiving a ‘ticking fee’ on the loan that started on May 1, 2015, of 50% of the margin. That fee increased to the full margin plus the Libor floor on June 1, 2015 where it will remain. Staples said last year it has already paid US$56m in commitment fees and expected to pay between US$25m and US$35m in fees during the fourth quarter.A Barclays spokesperson declined to comment. Spokespeople for Staples and Office Depot did not return telephone calls seeking comment.Staples and Office Depot remain committed to the transaction, according to a lender presentation, and will contest the FTC ruling in a court hearing on March 21. The company expects a decision by May 10. The funds would be released from escrow at the earlier of the merger closing, the merger terminating or the escrow outside date of September 10, with an additional two-month extension option. Escrow is an account in which money is held until a specific condition, such as the completion of an acquisition, is met.Barclays said on the January 20 call it would post final term loan documents on January 25 and that commitments are due on January 27. The company is also seeking to extend commitments on the asset-based revolving credit facility to May 10.Framingham, Massachusetts-based Staples previously tried to purchase Boca Raton, Florida-based Office Depot in 1997 when the rivals reached an agreement but regulators forced the cancellation due to antitrust concerns.

The company expects a decision by May 10. The funds would be released from escrow at the earlier of the merger closing, the merger terminating or the escrow outside date of September 10, with an additional two-month extension option. Escrow is an account in which money is held until a specific condition, such as the completion of an acquisition, is met.Barclays said on the January 20 call it would post final term loan documents on January 25 and that commitments are due on January 27. The company is also seeking to extend commitments on the asset-based revolving credit facility to May 10.Framingham, Massachusetts-based Staples previously tried to purchase Boca Raton, Florida-based Office Depot in 1997 when the rivals reached an agreement but regulators forced the cancellation due to antitrust concerns.

138,"   By Kristen Haunss | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Jan 22 Office supply retailer Staples has offered to increase the rate it will pay lenders for a US$2.75bn loan backing its purchase of rival Office Depot after investors threatened not to fund the debt, which could derail a transaction already challenged by antitrust issues.The company is now offering to pay lenders 350bp over Libor with a 75bp floor, an increase from 275bp with a 75bp floor, sources said. It will be sold at a discount of 99 cents from the previously announced 99.5. The loan will have 12 months of 101 soft call protection.Re-commitments are due by 5 pm on January 27, sources said. Investors threatened not to fund the loan after they were told on a call January 20 by arranger Barclays that the debt would fund into an escrow account February 2, two days before the financing commitment deadline expired. Escrow is an account in which money is held until a specific condition, such as the completion of an acquisition, is met.Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and HSBC are also loan arrangers. Since the loan was sold to investors in April 2015, market conditions have changed markedly, with investment-grade loan yields now 50bp higher than when investors signed onto the financing. The term loan is rated Baa2/BBB. The issue highlights the risk of committing to funds in advance of deals closing in volatile markets. Investors started receiving a 'ticking fee' on the loan of 50% of the margin on May 1, 2015. That fee increased on June 1 to the full margin plus the Libor floor.The Federal Trade Commission has raised antitrust concerns about the transaction, and Staples and Office Depot said they will contest the ruling in a court hearing March 21. The companies say they remain committed to the deal, according to a lender presentation, and expect a decision from the court by May 10.Framingham, Massachusetts-based Staples previously tried to purchase Boca Raton, Florida-based Office Depot in 1997 but regulators forced the cancellation of the deal due to antitrust concerns.

142,"  WASHINGTON The Senate Judiciary Committee's antitrust subcommittee will hear from the top U.S. antitrust bosses next month to discuss a wave of big mergers over the past year, according to a staffer briefed on the hearing.The Justice Department's Bill Baer, the assistant attorney general for the antitrust division, and Edith Ramirez, chairwoman of the Federal Trade Commission, will testify, the staffer said. The two divide the work of antitrust enforcement.The hearing will be March 9 at the Senate Judiciary Committee's antitrust panel, which is headed by Senator Mike Lee, a Republican from Utah. One matter that will be taken up is the FTC's use of Section Five, a portion of its authority that it uses to investigate companies which urge rivals to collude with them on price.The agencies are looking at a startling number of major, controversial mergers. The Justice Department is investigating two large insurance mergers - Aetna Inc (AET.N) buying Humana Inc (HUM.N) and Anthem Inc (ANTM.N) buying Cigna Corp (CI.N) - to insure they comply with antitrust law. It is also looking at Halliburton Co's (HAL.N) purchase of Baker Hughes Inc (BHI.N), among a long list of other deals. The FTC is suing Staples Inc (SPLS.O) in hopes of stopping it from buying Office Depot Inc (ODP.O). It also said in late 2015 that it aimed to stop three mergers of medical centers, one in West Virginia, another in Chicago and a third in Pennsylvania.

143,"  Clippers snap Spurs' six-game win streakLOS ANGELES -- The inspiration of Monty Williams pulled Doc Rivers through an emotionally charged day.""I think a lot of us got our strength from Monty, really,"" the Los Angeles Clippers coach said after hearing Williams, an Oklahoma City Thunder assistant coach, eulogize his wife earlier Thursday. ""It was probably the best speech I have ever heard, especially in the circumstances that he was going through, and still has to go through. It's not over for him. He has five kids.""Point guard Chris Paul scored 26 of his 28 points in the second half, and the Clippers snapped the San Antonio Spurs' six-game winning streak with a 105-86 victory Thursday night at Staples Center.The game was practically an afterthought. Rivers, Spurs coach Gregg Popovich and several players from both clubs started the day in Oklahoma City, where funeral services were held for Ingrid Williams, who died Feb. 11 from injuries sustained in a car crash a day earlier. Williams delivered a heart-felt speech at the service.""There was so much support by the NBA, 'Pop,' all the Spurs -- Tim Duncan, David West and LaMarcus Aldridge, Chris Paul, all of the (New Orleans) Pelicans and the Thunder,"" Rivers said. ""It was almost a celebration, but obviously for sad reasons.""The emotions of the funeral and the impact of Ingrid Williams' tragic death combined with this being the clubs' first game since the All-Star break seemed to carry over. The teams combined for 76 points and 21 turnovers in the first half, 14 of the giveaways by the Clippers. Los Angeles would finish with 20 turnovers to 16 for San Antonio, but Paul guided the Clippers to a win with a solid second half. ""He made timely shots,"" Aldridge said of Paul. ""He got guys to their spots, and made good passes as he always does. He definitely took over (for) his team in the fourth.""Paul also had 12 assists as the Clippers (36-18) won for the eighth time in 10 games. Los Angeles guard Jamal Crawford had 19 points, and guard J.J. Redick added 17.Point guard Tony Parker scored 14 points, forward David West had 12 and Aldridge chipped in 10 points for the Spurs, who played without All-Star forward Kawhi Leonard. ""No excuses,"" Aldridge said. ""We just had one of those nights where guys didn't play as good as they should have.""Leonard, the club's leading scorer at 20.2 points per game, was a late scratch due to tightness in his left calf. Kyle Anderson, who had eight points, started in his place for the Spurs (45-9).Duncan finished with two points on 1-of-6 shooting and six rebounds in 20 minutes. He left without speaking to reporters.The Clippers held a 42-34 edge at halftime. A 14-4 run to open the third quarter gave Los Angeles a 56-38 advantage after two free throws by forward Paul Pierce at 7:41. The Clippers increased the margin to as much as 20 before the Spurs sliced the deficit to 72-63 heading into the fourth quarter. After a bucket by Anderson pulled San Antonio within 77-71 with 9:06 left in the contest, the Clippers went on a 21-6 surge to seal the outcome.""Guys have to play better,"" Popovich said. ""David West had a pretty good game. Kyle Anderson had a pretty good game. Everybody else was pretty poor. That is not going to get it done in the NBA. More guys have to play well, that is the bottom line.""The Clippers outshot the Spurs 50 percent to 42.2 percent. They also made 12 of 25 3-pointers (48 percent) to only four of 17 (23.5 percent) for the Spurs.""They were down guys, we were down guys,"" said Clippers center DeAndre Jordan, who had a game-high 17 rebounds and added nine points and three steals. ""We just made shots, but it's the first time after the All-Star break, teams are going to be a little rusty. We just have to continue to get better as the postseason nears.""The Clippers announced shortly before tip-off that they acquired forward Jeff Green from the Memphis Grizzlies in exchange for guard Lance Stephenson and a future protected first-round pick. The 6-foot-9 Green, who averaged 12.2 points and four rebounds in 53 games (51 starts) with Memphis, played under Rivers from 2011-2013 with the Boston Celtics.NOTES: Injured Clippers F Blake Griffin (partially torn quad tendon/right hand fracture) sat on the bench in street clothes.

The Kings tried to rally late, getting a Vinny Lecavalier goal with 5:01 remaining in the third period. Lecavalier corralled a loose puck in front of the net and scored, but that was it for the Kings.The Sharks, who owned the best road record in the NHL, have yet to lose at Staples this season. They claimed both regular-season matches in Los Angeles, scoring a 5-3 win on Dec. 22 and a 5-1 rout on Oct. 7. They have defeated Los Angeles in five of the seven contests this season. Pavelski scored his third goal of the series, gathering a pass from Brent Burns and smoking a shot over the shoulder of Quick for a 1-0 edge at 3:37 of the first period.The Sharks got a 5-on-3 opportunity in the second period and quickly took advantage of it. Thirty seconds after Tyler Toffoli and Lucic Milan were sent to the box for roughing and charging, respectively, Couture made it 2-0, rebounding a miss by Pavelski and burying a wrist shot for his first goal of the playoffs on a power play at 8:44 of the second.

155,"   By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Options traders are bracing for wild gyrations in the shares of Staples Inc and Office Depot Inc as the companies await a ruling that could scuttle their pending merger.Staples, the largest U.S. office supplies retailer, agreed to buy the second-biggest player, Office Depot, in a $6.3 billion deal in February of 2015, but the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, which regulates competition, sued in December to block the merger.The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia is expected to decide next week whether to grant the FTC's request for a preliminary injunction to block the transaction until an administrative judge can review it.A decision is expected by May 10, Office Depot Chief Executive Roland Smith said last week.An injunction could kill the deal since protracted litigation makes it difficult to hold a merger together.    Options traders have pumped up expectations for a large near-term move in the shares.

156,"   By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Options traders are bracing for wild gyrations in the shares of Staples Inc and Office Depot Inc as the companies await a ruling that could scuttle their pending merger.Staples, the largest U.S. office supplies retailer, agreed to buy the second-biggest player, Office Depot, in a $6.3 billion deal in February of 2015, but the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, which regulates competition, sued in December to block the merger.The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia is expected to decide next week whether to grant the FTC's request for a preliminary injunction to block the transaction until an administrative judge can review it.A decision is expected by May 10, Office Depot Chief Executive Roland Smith said last week.An injunction could kill the deal since protracted litigation makes it difficult to hold a merger together.

162,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, May 11 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the Long-Term Issuer Default  Rating (IDR) for Staples, Inc. (Staples) at 'BB+' and the Short-Term IDR at 'B'.  Fitch has removed the Rating Watch Negative following the announced termination  of the Office Depot acquisition. The Rating Outlook is Stable. A full list of rating actions follows at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS Office Depot Merger to be Terminated Staples and Office Depot announced an intention to terminate their merger  agreement on May 16, 2016 following a federal court decision to grant the FTC's  request to block the merger on anti-competitive concerns. Standalone Business Expected to Be Flat at Best The ratings reflect continued secular headwinds and competitive challenges in  the office products category which have pressured EBITDA since 2012. On a  standalone basis, Fitch views Staples as having limited ability to reverse  declines in sales and EBITDA over the forecast horizon, especially given the  heightened threat from new entrants in the contract stationer business. Staples has fought a number of challenges in recent years, including both  secular headwinds and strengthened competition. The ongoing digitalization of  the workplace has had a negative impact on sales of core office supplies,  ink/toner and paper, which represent around half of Staples volume. Sales of  technology products (approximately 20% of sales) have been weak due to a slowing  replacement cycle and saturation of key products such as laptops and tablets.  Fitch expects both of these headwinds to continue over the forecast horizon. As sales shift online across many retail categories, new competitors have  emerged in the office products category, pressuring in-store sales across the  industry. Since 2012, Staples' North American retail sales are down  approximately 25% (recently exacerbated by the weak Canadian dollar) and margins  of the combined retail/Staples.com business have contracted from 8.3% to 4.5%.  As a result, EBITDA contribution has declined nearly 50% from $1.2 billion (57%  of total) in 2012 to $650 million (45% of total) in 2015.  Amazon has begun a significant push into office products sales to contract  customers, which will limit market share opportunities for existing players.  Sales and EBITDA to contract customers have been fairly stable for the last few  years, but Fitch expects Staples' competitive positioning could weaken over  time.  Staples has undertaken a number of initiatives to combat these challenges.  First, the company has reduced its North American store base by around 300 units  or over 15% since 2011, with another 50 announced for 2016, to an expected 1,510  by the end of 2016. Second, the company has refocused selling efforts around  categories including breakroom and janitorial supplies, which are seeing less  secular pressure. Finally, the company has managed its cost structure through  the elimination of over $750 million in expenses over the last three years. The company has announced an additional $300 million cost reduction program to  be completed by 2018, and the pursuit of strategic alternatives for Staples'  European business, which Fitch estimates is modestly EBITDA negative. While these efforts have mitigated secular pressures, Staples' sales and EBITDA  have declined each year from their respective peaks in 2011 of $25 billion and  $2.3 billion. In 2015, $21 billion in sales and EBITDA of $1.4 billion were both  6% below 2014 levels, with EBITDA margin falling to 6.7% from the 2011 peak of  9%. Fitch believes medium-term EBITDA will remain flat at best, likely within  the $1.2 billion - $1.4 billion range, as industry challenges persist. Given the above EBITDA expectations, adjusted leverage is expected to trend in  the 3.2x - 3.4x range over the forecast horizon, which Fitch views as  representative of a 'BB+' rating for a secularly challenged retailer. KEY ASSUMPTIONS --Fitch expects modestly negative annual sales growth over the forecast horizon,  based on modestly negative retail/online comps and flattish growth in the  commercial delivery business, with EBITDA ranging between $1.2 billion - $1.4  billion on modest margin declines.  --Projected free cash flow (FCF) after dividends of $300 million in 2016 will be  used for merger-related debt issuance expenses of $100 million - $150 million  and merger breakup fees of $250 million. The company has announced $100 million  of share repurchases in 2016 and the company may need to fund this with revolver  borrowings or cash on hand. FCF is expected to remain in the $300 million range  annually beginning 2017, which Fitch expects will put towards share purchases. --Adjusted leverage is expected to remain in the 3.2x - 3.4x range. RATING SENSITIVITIES Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a negative  rating action include continued negative sales and margin trends and declines in  EBITDA that drive adjusted leverage above the mid-3x range. Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a positive  rating action include a stabilization of top-line trends, the resumption of  positive EBITDA momentum, and maintenance of adjusted debt/EBITDAR at or under  3x. LIQUIDITY The company had adequate liquidity at Jan. 30, 2016, comprising of $825 million  in cash and full availability on its $1 billion revolving credit facility.  FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has affirmed the following ratings: Staples, Inc. --Long-term IDR at 'BB+'; --$1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility at 'BB+/RR4';  --Senior unsecured notes at 'BB+/RR4'; --Short-term IDR at 'B'; --Commercial paper at 'B'. The Outlook is Stable. In addition, Fitch has withdrawn the ratings on the following  acquisition-related debt due to the announced termination of the Office Depot  merger: --$3 billion secured revolving credit facility; --$2.5 billion secured term loan.

The global default rate rose to 4% in April compared to 2.1% a year ago, with 46 defaults recorded in the first four months of the year, 18 in the oil and gas sector, according to a May 9 Moody’s Investors Service report. Staples said on Tuesday that it and Office Depot plan to terminate their merger agreement following the US District Court for the District of Columbia’s ruling granting the Federal Trade Commission’s request for a preliminary injunction to block the transaction, according to a May 10 news release.Barclays, the agent on the deal, told investors the loan will be repaid at par, or 100 cents on the dollar, within a few days after the termination announcement, sources said. Staples sold the loan at a discount of 99 cents in January, LPC previously reported. It was funded into escrow on February 2. As part of the mechanics of the transaction, lenders were told in a January deal update that “in the event that the escrow funds are returned to lenders due to termination of the merger or expiration of the escrow, the escrow term loan will be repaid at par.”A Barclays spokesperson did not return a telephone call seeking comment. A Staples spokesperson declined to comment. An Office Depot spokesperson referred a call to Staples.Investors that bought the US$2.5bn loan at 99 cents in January may be happy with the quick return, sources said, while those that purchased the debt when it was trading above par – it was quoted at 100.25-100.5 May 3 – are stuck with a loss. A US$3bn asset-based revolving line of credit that Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Barclays, Wells Fargo, HSBC, PNC, TD Bank, US Bank and JP Morgan had committed to provide will be terminated, according to a Wednesday regulatory filing.Banks committed to the financing, which initially included a US$2.75bn term loan and the US$3bn revolver, in February 2015, according to a March 4 regulatory filing. After some investors threatened not to fund the loan in January, the interest rate was increased to LIB+400 and the size of the term loan was cut to US$2.5bn from US$2.75bn. The loan had a minimum level that the London interbank offered rate could be calculated at of 75bp. Staples said in 2015 it incurred commitment and other related fees of US$94m related to the term loan, according to the March 4 filing. Of that amount, US$2m was paid last year, US$68m was paid on February 2, and US$24m is payable upon closing or termination of the proposed acquisition.Framingham, Massachusetts-based Staples previously tried to purchase Boca Raton, Florida-based Office Depot in 1997 when the rivals reached an agreement but regulators forced the cancellation due to antitrust concerns.(Additional reporting by Jonathan Schwarzberg in New York.)

Analysts had expected sales of $4.77 billion.Sales at its established stores in North America fell 5 percent, steeper than the 3.1 percent drop analysts polled by research firm Consensus Metrix had expected. Besides trying to buy Office Depot - a deal that fell apart over antitrust concerns - Staples has been responding to tough conditions by closing stores and focusing on serving medium-sized businesses rather than Fortune 500 companies.The company is also focusing on offerings other than office supplies, such as electronics and furniture, and said in May it would step up deliveries to 80 percent of total North American sales within three years in an effort to compete with Amazon.Staples posted a net loss of $766 million, or $1.18 per share, in the latest quarter, due to a $986 million pre-tax charge related to its European operations and costs associated with the termination of the Office Depot deal. It earned $36 million, or 6 cents per share, a year earlier. Staples reiterated it would close 50 stores in North America this year. It closed 242 stores in 2014 and 2015 as a part of a restructuring plan. Staples had 1,907 stores as of Jan. 30.Office Depot earlier this month said it would close about 300 more stores in the next three years to help cut annual costs.

199,"  Office supplies retailer Staples Inc (SPLS.O) said it would sell a controlling stake in its European business to private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management LP for 50 million euros ($53.65 million) to focus on its North American operations.Staples' European unit consists of retail, contract and online businesses in 16 countries, generating aggregate annual sales of about 1.7 billion euros.The company said it would retain a 15 percent stake in the European business. The deal comes two months after smaller rival Office Depot Inc (ODP.O) said it would sell its European operations to investment company Aurelius Group.    Staples and Office Depot called off their planned merger in May due to antitrust concerns. Following the scrapping of the deal, Staples named a new chief executive and announced a $300 million cost-cutting plan and exploration of strategic alternatives for the European business.Staples' sale of the European unit is expected to be completed during the first quarter of its fiscal year beginning February 2017, subject to certain conditions.  Cerberus plans to bolster the European business by expanding its sales force and diversifying beyond office supplies, said  Steven Mayer, the private equity fund's senior managing director.     Staples said last month it would sell its UK retail business and operations to Hilco Capital, which invests in distressed companies. Barclays was financial adviser to Staples and Clifford Chance LLP was its legal adviser. Kirkland & Ellis LLP and Linklaters LLP were legal advisers to Cerberus.
