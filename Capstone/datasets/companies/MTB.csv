6,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, October 07 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed M&T Bank Corporation's  (MTB) ratings at 'A-/F1'. The Rating Outlook remains Positive. The affirmation  and Outlook reflects the company's consistent and solid performance during a  difficult operating environment. Additionally, Fitch views the company's strong  franchise, veteran management team, and good revenue diversification as rating  strengths.  The rating action follows a periodic review of the large regional banking group,  which includes BB&T Corporation (BBT), Capital One Financial Corporation (COF),  Comerica Incorporated (CMA), Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB), Huntington Bancshares  Inc. (HBAN), Keycorp (KEY), M&T Bank Corporation (MTB), MUFG Americas Holdings  Corporation (MUFG), PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (PNC), Regions Financial  Corporation (RF), SunTrust Banks Inc. (STI), US Bancorp (USB), Wells Fargo &  Company (WFC), and Zions Bancorporation (ZION). Company-specific rating rationales for the other banks are published separately,  and for further discussion of the large regional bank sector in general, refer  to the special report titled 'Large Regional Bank Periodic Review,' to be  published shortly.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - IDRS, VRs AND SENIOR DEBT MTB's rating affirmation and Positive Outlook mainly reflects the consistency of  the company's performance during a difficult operating environment versus peers.  Additionally, Fitch views the company's solid franchise, credit performance,  veteran management team, and good revenue diversification as rating strengths. Offsetting these positives, MTB capital levels tends to be lower than peers.  However, Fitch's believes the company's strong equity generation, good asset  quality performance through various credit cycles, solid reserves when compared  to net charge-offs (NCOs) and moderate dividend payout help offset the  below-average capital position. Further, MTB has continued to build its capital  position from historical levels.  MTB's earnings profile is considered to be one of the strongest of its peer  group as results have not been supported by any reserve release as the company's  provision expense continues to exceed NCOs. Further, MTB is one of the most  consistent performers as its earnings measures have seen less volatility than  most of its large regional peers.  Credit performance has also been solid, despite the company's large exposure to  commercial real-estate assets (40% of total loans versus large regional peer  average of 21%). MTB's NCO's and NPAs have outperformed most peers in numerous  economic downturns evidence of the strong credit culture of the company.  Additionally, Fitch believes the company's reserve coverage also provides good  support given loss history.  Further, Fitch considers MTB's management team to be a rating strength given the  stable, average tenure of 20 plus years with the company. Further, despite a  history of acquisitions, board composition has not changed dramatically. Fitch  also notes that the MTB's ownership includes roughly 17% held by management and  employees of the company which creates a strong alignment between management and  shareholders interest. Although capital position is considered to be MTB's weak spot, Fitch  acknowledges the company's improved capital ratios from historical levels such  as TCE, leverage and Common Tier 1. The company has continued to build its  capital position. As of 2Q'14, TCE and Tier 1 Common estimated (under Basel III)  stood at 8.45% (up 84bps compared to 2Q13) and approximately 9.24% (up 114bps  from 2Q13), respectively. Further, Fitch believes the company's strong and  consistent earnings and credit profile through various credit cycles affords the  leaner capital position.  RATING SENSITIVITIES - IDRS, VRs AND SENIOR DEBT Fitch expects to resolve the Outlook following the removal of the  BSA/AML-related MOU or final approval to acquire Hudson City, which would  indicate sufficient improvement in its BSA/AML risk management program. If the  regulatory order or the acquisition is still not completed within the next 12  months, Fitch may consider revising the Outlook to Stable. Positive rating momentum also hinges on MTB successful remediation of its  current BSA/AML deficiencies without any material regulatory fines and/or  restrictions. Additionally, Fitch would expect MTB's capital position to  continue to build while maintaining strong earnings, solid reserves and good  credit performance.  Conversely, negative rating drivers would be a more aggressive approach to  capital management, and/or announcing an acquisition in the near term given the  sizeable Hudson City transaction. In addition, unexpected changes to current  business strategy or key executive management would also be viewed negatively. KEY RATING DRIVERS - HOLDING COMPANY   MTB's IDR and VR are equalized with those of its operating companies and banks,  reflecting its role as the bank holding company, which is mandated in the U.S.  to act as a source of strength for its bank subsidiaries. Ratings are also  equalized reflecting the very close correlation between holding company and  subsidiary default probabilities.  RATING SENSITIVITIES - HOLDING COMPANY Should MTB's holding company begin to exhibit signs of weakness, demonstrate  trouble accessing the capital markets, or have inadequate cash flow coverage to  meet near-term obligations, there is the potential that Fitch could notch the  holding company IDR and VR from the ratings of the operating companies. This is  viewed as unlikely though for MTB, given the strength of the holding company  liquidity profile.  Fitch is now considering introducing a rating differential between the holding  company and bank in the U.S. due to structural changes in the sector and the  evolving regulatory landscape, as described in the special report 'U.S. Bank  HoldCos & OpCos: Evolving Risk Profiles', dated March 27, 2014. Given Fitch's  views that MTB may not receive a long-term debt requirement, its ratings may not  be impacted as a result of Fitch's evolving review regarding notching. KEY RATING DRIVERS - SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR  MTB has a Support Rating of '5' and Support Rating Floor of 'NF'. In Fitch's  view, MTB is not systemically important and therefore, the probability of  support is unlikely. IDRs and VRs do not incorporate any support.  RATING SENSITVITIES - SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR  MTB's Support Rating and Support Rating Floor are sensitive to Fitch's  assumption around capacity to procure extraordinary support in case of need.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES Subordinated debt and other hybrid capital issued by MTB and by various issuing  vehicles are all notched down from MTB or its bank subsidiaries' VRs in  accordance with Fitch's assessment of each instrument's respective  non-performance and relative loss severity risk profiles.  RATING SENSITIVITIES - SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES The ratings of subordinated debt and other hybrid capital issued by MTB and its  subsidiaries are primarily sensitive to any change in MTB's VR.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANY The IDRs and VRs of MTB's bank subsidiaries benefit from the cross-guarantee  mechanism in the U.S. under FIRREA, and therefore the IDRs and VRs of  Manufacturers and Traders Trust Co and Wilmington Trust, N.A. (formerly M&T  Bank, NA) are equalized across the group.  The IDRs and VRs of MTB's other major rated operating subsidiaries are equalized  with MTB's IDR reflecting Fitch's view that these entities are core to MTB's  business strategy and financial profile. These entities include: Wilmington  Trust Corporation and Wilmington Trust Company whose IDRs would be sensitive to  the same factors that might drive a change in MTB's IDR.  RATING SENSITIVITIES - SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANY  As the IDRs and VRs of the subsidiaries are equalized with those of MTB to  reflect support from their ultimate parent, they are sensitive to changes in the  parent's propensity to provide support, which Fitch currently does not expect,  or from changes in MTB's IDRs.  To the extent that one of MTB's subsidiary or affiliated companies is not  considered to be a core business, Fitch could also notch the subsidiary's rating  from MTB's IDR. KEY RATING DRIVERS - LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS MTB's uninsured deposit ratings are rated one notch higher than the company's  IDR and senior unsecured debt because U.S. uninsured deposits benefit from  depositor preference. U.S. depositor preference gives deposit liabilities  superior recovery prospects in the event of default.  KEY RATING SENSITIVITIES - LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS The ratings of long- and short-term deposits issued by MTB and its subsidiaries  are primarily sensitive to any change in MTB's long- and short-term IDRs.  Fitch has affirmed the following ratings with a Positive Outlook: M&T Bank Corporation --Long-term IDR at 'A-'; Outlook Positive; --Short-term IDR at 'F1'; --Viability at 'a-';     --Preferred stock at 'BB'; --Support at '5'     --Support floor 'NF'.

Wilmington Trust, N.A.

Wilmington Trust Corporation --Long-term IDR at 'A-'; Outlook Positive; --Subordinated debt at 'BBB+'; --Short-term IDR at 'F1'; --Viability at 'a-';     --Support at '5';     --Support floor at `NF'. Wilmington Trust Company --Long-term IDR at 'A-'; Outlook Positive --Short-term IDR at 'F1'; --Viability at 'a-';     --Support at '5';     --Support floor at 'NF'.

7,"   By Elvina Nawaguna | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON M&T Bank Corp will pay $2.9 million in refunds to some of its customers, the U.S. consumer watchdog announced on Thursday, saying that the bank had ""deceptively"" marketed free checking accounts but later charged fees for them.The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) said that between January 2009 and September 2012, the bank solicited customers with promises of ""no strings attached"" free checking accounts without disclosing certain eligibility requirements in its advertisements. M&T failed to state in those ads that customers had to maintain a minimum level of account activity to keep their free-checking status, and did not clearly inform customers who had been converted to a fee-based account, the CFPB said. When customers failed to meet the requirements, the Buffalo, New York-based bank would automatically switch them to fee-based checking accounts and start charging for transactions.Darren King, M&T's executive vice president for retail and business banking, said in a statement that the bank had cooperated with the CFPB and has since changed its policies and procedures. The bank will refund the money to the 59,000 customers it charged in fees and also pay a $200,000 penalty to the CFPB's Civil Penalty Fund. ""Tens of thousands of consumers ended up paying for a product they had thought was free,"" CFPB Director Richard Cordray said in a statement. ""This is an important reminder to all banks and credit unions that they cannot misstate to consumers whether a financial product or service is free.""   It is illegal for banks and credit unions to deceptively advertise deposit accounts, to charge maintenance or activity fees, or make customers pay for transactions in accounts advertised as free.The bank will credit customers who still have open accounts for any fees charged, send checks to those with closed accounts and update the credit reports of any customers affected by the fees.The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, signed in 2010, gives the CFPB authority to take action against banks and other institutions violating consumer financial laws.

The Department of Justice had determined that the merger would not have a significantly adverse effect on competition, the Federal Reserve said, adding that the banking agencies have not objected to the deal. (1.usa.gov/1M1YZwi) After the merger, M&T Bank will become the 25th largest depository financial institution in the United States, with assets of about $132.5 billion and deposits of about $90.8 billion, the Federal Reserve said.

25,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, October 05 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has upgraded M&T Bank Corporation's  (MTB) Long-term IDRs and VR to 'A' from 'A-'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.  The rating action follows a periodic review of the large regional banking group,  which includes BB&T Corporation (BBT), Capital One Finance Corporation (COF),  Comerica Incorporated (CMA), Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB), Huntington Bancshares  Inc. (HBAN), Keycorp (KEY), M&T Bank Corporation (MTB), PNC Financial Services  Group (PNC), Regions Financial Corporation (RF), SunTrust Banks Inc. (STI), US  Bancorp (USB), UnionBanCal Corporation (UBC), Wells Fargo & Company (WFC), and  Zions Bancorporation (ZION).  Company-specific rating rationales for the other banks are published separately,  and for further discussion of the large regional bank sector in general, refer  to the special report titled 'Large Regional Bank Periodic Review,' to be  published shortly.  KEY RATING DRIVERS  IDRS, VRs AND SENIOR DEBT MTB's rating upgrade is supported by the company's idiosyncratic strengths such  as its improving capital position, consistent and solid performance during a  difficult operating environment and through various economic downturns.  Additionally, Fitch views the company's strong franchise, veteran management  team, and good revenue diversification favorably.  Fitch views the company's core strengths and profile solidly in-line with other  'A' rated peers. Although MTB's experienced an unusual delay to get the Hudson  City (Hudson) transaction closed and still has its written agreement due to  BSA/AML in place, Fitch believes these two events are neutral to its 'A' rating.  Fitch notes that MTB has continued to build its capital compared to its  historical levels and is in-line with similarly-rated peers. MTB's tangible  common equity ratio stood at 8.45% versus 6.41% 10-year average. While MTB's  capital level is better than its past history, in Fitch's view, capital ratios  will tend to fall on the lower-end of the large regional peer group averages.  However, Fitch's believes the company's strong equity generation, good asset  quality performance through various credit cycles, solid reserves when compared  to net charge-offs (NCOs) and moderate dividend payout help offset the company's  leaner capital position.  MTB's core earnings profile is considered to be one of the strongest of its peer  group with no support from reserve release. Further, MTB is one of the most  consistent performers as its profitability measures have seen less volatility  than most of its large regional peers.  Credit performance has also been consistently solid, despite the company's large  exposure to commercial real-estate assets (41% of total loans versus large  regional peer average of 19% as of June 30, 2015). MTB's NCO's and NPAs measures  have been superior versus most of its peer group through numerous economic and  real estate downturns; evidence of the strong credit culture at the company.  Additionally, Fitch believes the company's reserve coverage also provides good  support given loss history.  Further, Fitch considers MTB's management team to be a rating strength given the  stable, average tenure of 20+ years with the company. Further, despite a history  of acquisitions, board composition has not changed dramatically. Roughly 15% of  MTB's ownership is held by management and employees of the company, which  creates a strong alignment between management and shareholders interest. SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR  MTB has a Support Rating of '5' and Support Rating Floor of 'NF'. In Fitch's  view, MTB is not systemically important and therefore, the probability of  support is unlikely. IDRs and VRs do not incorporate any support.  SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES MTB subordinated debt is one notch below its VR. The company's trust preferred  securities are four notches below the VR; two notches down for loss severity and  two notches down for non-performance. MTB's preferred securities are rated five  notches below its VR; two notches for loss severity and three for  non-performance. Subordinated debt and other hybrid securities ratings are in accordance with  Fitch's criteria and assessment of the instruments' non-performance and loss  severity risk profiles. These ratings have been upgraded one notch due to the  VR's upgrade. HOLDING COMPANY  MTB's IDR and VR are equalized with those of its operating companies and banks,  reflecting its role as the bank holding company, which is mandated in the U.S.  to act as a source of strength for its bank subsidiaries. The ratings are also  equalized and reflect the very close correlation between holding company and  subsidiary default probabilities.  SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANY The IDRs and VRs of MTB's bank subsidiaries benefit from the cross-guarantee  mechanism in the U.S. under FIRREA, and therefore the IDRs and VRs of  Manufacturers and Traders Trust Co were also upgraded and are equalized across  the group.  LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS MTB's uninsured deposit ratings were also upgraded as they are rated one notch  higher than the company's IDR and senior unsecured debt, because U.S. uninsured  deposits benefit from depositor preference. U.S. depositor preference gives  deposit liabilities superior recovery prospects in the event of default RATING SENSITIVITIES IDR, VR, AND SENIOR DEBT Following MTB's upgrade, ratings are at the high end of the range given  performance and profile of the company. Although not envisioned over the rating  horizon, MTB's ratings could have positive momentum should it develop a more  diversified franchise through strengthening its consumer/retail penetration and  product offerings along with further geographic diversification of its  commercial lending book, while successfully integrating Hudson City. This would  also entail maintaining peer leading profitability and asset quality measures. Incorporated in the rating upgrade is the view that MTB will not incur any  material regulatory fines and/or restrictions related to its BSA/AML written  agreement. Additionally, MTB will be in full compliance with the regulatory  order's remediation actions, which should lead to the written agreement being  lifted. Conversely, negative rating drivers would be a more aggressive approach to  capital management, and/or announcing an acquisition in the near term given the  sizeable Hudson City transaction. In addition, unexpected changes to current  business strategy or key executive management would also be viewed negatively. SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR MTB's Support Rating and Support Rating Floor are sensitive to Fitch's  assumption around capacity to procure extraordinary support in case of need. SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES The ratings of subordinated debt and other hybrid capital issued by MTB and its  subsidiaries are primarily sensitive to any change in MTB's VR.  HOLDING COMPANY Should MTB's holding company begin to exhibit signs of weakness, demonstrate  trouble accessing the capital markets, or have inadequate cash flow coverage to  meet near-term obligations, Fitch could potentially notch the holding company's  IDR and VR from the ratings of the operating companies. However, this is  unlikely for MTB given the strength of the holding company's liquidity profile.  SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANY  As the IDRs and VRs of the subsidiaries are equalized with those of MTB to  reflect support from their ultimate parent, they are sensitive to changes in the  parent's propensity to provide support, which Fitch currently does not expect,  or from changes in MTB's IDRs.  LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS The ratings of the long- and short-term deposits issued by MTB and its  subsidiaries are primarily sensitive to any change in MTB's long- and short-term  IDRs.  Fitch has upgraded and revised the Rating Outlook to Stable from Positive for  the following ratings:  M&T Bank Corporation --Long-term IDR to 'A' from 'A-'; Outlook Stable; --Viability to 'a' from 'a-';     --Preferred stock to 'BB+' from 'BB'. Manufacturers and Traders Trust Co --Long-term IDR to 'A' from 'A-'; Outlook Stable; --Viability to 'a' from 'a-';     --Senior unsecured debt to 'A' from 'A-';  --Subordinated debt to 'A-' from 'BBB+'; --Long-term deposits to 'A+' from 'A'.

Wilmington Trust Company --Long-term IDR to 'A' from 'A-'; Outlook Stable; --Viability to 'a' from 'a-'. Provident (MD) Capital Trust I --Preferred stock to 'BBB-' from 'BB+'. Fitch has affirmed the following ratings:  M&T Bank Corporation --Short-term IDR at 'F1'; --Support at '5';     --Support floor 'NF'.

40,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, October 04 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed M&T Bank Corporation's  (MTB) Long-Term Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) and Viability Rating (VR) at 'A'.  The Rating Outlook is Stable.  The rating action follows a periodic review of the large regional banking group,  which includes M&T Bank Corporation (MTB), BB&T Corporation (BBT), Capital One  Finance Corporation (COF), Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (CFG), Comerica  Incorporated (CMA), Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB), Huntington Bancshares Inc.  (HBAN), Keycorp (KEY), MUFG Americas Holding Corporation (MUAH), PNC Financial  Services Group (PNC), Regions Financial Corporation (RF), SunTrust Banks Inc.  (STI), US Bancorp (USB), Wells Fargo & Company (WFC), and Zions Bancorporation  (ZION).  Company-specific rating rationales for the other banks are published separately,  and for further discussion of the large regional bank sector in general, refer  to the special report titled 'Large Regional Bank Periodic Review,' to be  published shortly.  KEY RATING DRIVERS  IDRS, NATIONAL RATINGS AND SENIOR DEBT MTB's rating affirmation is supported by the company's strengths such as solid  performance during a difficult operating environment and through various  economic downturns as well as its improving capital position. Additionally,  Fitch views the company's strong franchise, veteran management team, and good  revenue diversification favorably.  Fitch believes the company's core strengths and profile are solidly in-line with  other 'A' rated peers. Although MTB's still has a written agreement due to  BSA/AML outstanding, Fitch views it as neutral to the company's 'A' rating.  MTB's core earnings profile is considered to be one of the strongest of its peer  group with no support from reserve releases. Further, MTB is one of the most  consistent performers and financial measures have seen less volatility than most  of its large regional peers. The company's earnings has one of the lowest  10-year standard deviation of ROA.  Overall the last two years, performance has been more in-line with its peer  group. Some of this is reflecting the increase in IT spending for BSA compliance  as well as other IT projects to improve certain platforms. Further, Fitch  believes the Hudson City acquisition should provide a solid platform for future  commercial growth. The company has also indicated that the deal is still in-line  to achieve many of its projected targets. Credit performance has also been consistently solid, despite the company's large  exposure to commercial real-estate assets (CRE), which stood at 35% of total  loans versus large regional peer average of 19% as of June 30, 2016. MTB's NCO's  and NPAs measures have been superior versus most of its peer group through  numerous economic and real estate downturns and indicative of the strong credit  culture at the company. Additionally, Fitch believes the company's reserve  coverage also provides good support given loss history. Although CRE lending,  particularly multi-family, has been growing rapidly and competition has been  aggressive for the industry, incorporated in Fitch's affirmation would be  continued superior credit performance. Fitch also recognizes that MTB has continued to build its capital compared to  its historical levels and is in-line with similarly-rated peers. MTB's tangible  common equity ratio stood at 8.49% versus a 6.41% 10-year average. While MTB's  capital level is better than its past history, in Fitch's view, capital ratios  will tend to fall on the lower-end of the large regional peer group averages.  However, Fitch's believes the company's strong equity generation, good asset  quality performance through various credit cycles, solid reserves when compared  to net charge-offs (NCOs) and moderate dividend payout help offset the company's  leaner capital position. For CCAR 2016, MTB was the only bank to pass the Fed's stress test after making  a revision to its capital request. M&T's CET1 ratio would be 5%, under the  severe stress scenario, which ranks at the lowest of its peers. Although the  company's historical credit losses through credit cycles have been steady, under  the CCAR stress test, MTB's would 4.3 times its peak losses during the crisis.  Further, Fitch considers MTB's management team to be a rating strength given the  stable, average tenure of 20+ years with the company. Further, despite a history  of acquisitions, board composition has not changed dramatically. Roughly 12% of  MTB's ownership is held by management and employees of the company, which  creates a strong alignment between management and shareholders interest. SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES MTB's subordinated debt is notched one level below its VR for loss severity.  MTB's preferred stock is notched five levels below its VR, two times for loss  severity and three times for non-performance, while MTB's trust preferred  securities are notched two times from the VR for loss severity and two times for  non-performance. These ratings are in accordance with Fitch's criteria and  assessment of the instruments non-performance and loss severity risk profiles  and have thus been affirmed due to the affirmation of the VR.  LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS The uninsured deposit ratings of Manufacturers and Traders Trust Co, are rated  one notch higher than MTB's IDR and senior unsecured debt because U.S. uninsured  deposits benefit from depositor preference. U.S. depositor preference gives  deposit liabilities superior recovery prospects in the event of default.  HOLDING COMPANY  MTB's IDR and VR are equalized with those of its operating companies and bank,  reflecting its role as the bank holding company, which is mandated in the U.S.  to act as a source of strength for its bank subsidiaries. Ratings are also  equalized reflecting the very close correlation between holding company and  subsidiary failure and default probabilities.  SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR MTB has a Support Rating of '5' and Support Rating Floor of 'NF'. In Fitch's  view, MTB is not systemically important and therefore, the probability of  support is unlikely. IDRs and VRs do not incorporate any support.  RATING SENSITIVITIES VR, IDRs, AND SENIOR DEBT MTB's ratings are at the high end of the range given performance and profile of  the company. Although not envisioned over the rating horizon, MTB's ratings  could have positive momentum should it develop a more diversified franchise  through strengthening its consumer/retail penetration and product offerings  along with further geographic diversification of its commercial lending book,  while successfully integrating Hudson City. This would also entail maintaining  peer leading profitability and asset quality measures. Incorporated in the rating upgrade is the view that MTB will not incur any  material regulatory fines and/or restrictions related to its BSA/AML written  agreement. Additionally, MTB will be in full compliance with the regulatory  order's remediation actions, which should lead to the written agreement being  lifted. Conversely, negative rating drivers would be a more aggressive approach to  capital management, and/or announcing an acquisition in the near term given the  sizeable Hudson City transaction. In addition, unexpected changes to current  business strategy or key executive management would also be viewed negatively. SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES The ratings for MTB and its operating companies' subordinated debt and preferred  stock are sensitive to any change to MTB's VR.  LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS The long- and short-term deposit ratings are sensitive to any change to KEY's  long- and short-term IDR.  HOLDING COMPANY  Should MTB's holding company begin to exhibit signs of weakness, demonstrate  trouble accessing the capital markets, or have inadequate cash flow coverage to  meet near-term obligations, there is the potential that Fitch could notch the  holding company IDR and VR from the ratings of the operating companies.  SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR Since MTB's Support and Support Rating Floors are '5' and 'NF', respectively,  there is limited likelihood that these ratings will change over the foreseeable  future.

41,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, October 04 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed SunTrust Banks Inc.'s.  (STI) ratings at 'A-/F1'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. The affirmation reflects  an improved earnings profile, good asset quality performance, and continual  enhancements to the company's balanced and diverse business mix.   The rating action follows a periodic review of the large regional banking group,  which includes BB&T Corporation (BBT), Capital One Finance Corporation (COF),  Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (CFG), Comerica Incorporated (CMA), Fifth Third  Bancorp (FITB), Huntington Bancshares Inc. (HBAN), Keycorp (KEY), M&T Bank  Corporation (MTB), MUFG Americas Holding Corporation (MUAH), PNC Financial  Services Group (PNC), Regions Financial Corporation (RF), SunTrust Banks Inc.  (STI), US Bancorp (USB), Wells Fargo & Company (WFC), and Zions Bancorporation  (ZION).  Company-specific rating rationales for the other banks are published separately,  and for further discussion of the large regional bank sector in general, refer  to the special report titled 'Large Regional Bank Periodic Review,' to be  published shortly.  KEY RATING DRIVERS  VR, IDRs and Senior Unsecured Debt SunTrust Banks, Inc.'s (STI) earnings continue to exhibit improvement, and have  since converged to large regional bank averages. Over the past 12 months, STI  has reported an ROA of 1.02%, in line with peer medians, and an improvement from  the prior 12 months. One of STI's overarching strategic objectives over the  near-term is to improve its efficiency, which has also demonstrated improvement  over the past 12 months. STI's earnings benefit from a solid level of  non-interest income, with revenues from deposit service charges, investment  banking, trading income, mortgage revenues, as well as trust and investment  management income.  STI's ratings also reflect the company's balanced consumer and commercial  banking franchise, as well as a national mortgage banking franchise and a  sizable and strong middle-market-focused capital markets business. Since the  financial crisis, STI has materially reduced its reliance on residential real  estate, with more diversification between consumer and commercial loans, now  comprising 45% and 55% of total loans, respectively, as of June 30, 2016. STI has an attractive retail franchise with the No.1 share of deposits in  Georgia, and the No.3 share in both Florida and Tennessee. The franchise  includes many states with favorable demographic trends in the Southeast and  Mid-Atlantic. STI has the second highest percentage of its deposits in states  where its market share is ranked either first, second or third.  The company's good asset quality performance also supports its ratings. While  STI's level of NPAs remains somewhat elevated, this includes a large balance of  mortgage-related troubled debt restructurings (TDRs), of which, 97% of these  accruing TDRs are current, mitigating the associated credit risk. Excluding the  accruing TDRs from problem asset totals, STI's ratio of adjusted NPAs to total  loans and foreclosed real estate falls to the third lowest of the large regional  peer group. With NCOs in second quarter 2016 (2Q16) at 39bps, Fitch expects some  credit deterioration for STI, as well as the industry, as credit losses are  likely at unsustainably low levels. STI's securities portfolio continues to present nominal credit risk with  approximately 97% of its holdings related to either agency mortgage-backed  securities or U.S. Treasuries/agency debt, one of the highest levels among the  large regional banks. Further, STI's energy book appears to have less risk than  peers given the least exposure to the E&P and oilfield services sectors.  STI's transitional Common Equity Tier 1 ratio under Basel III was 9.8% at June  30, 2016. This is around 100bps below the peer median, though well above the  requirement of 7%.  The bank's ratio of Fitch Core Capital to risk-weighted  assets is also below peer medians.  Despite this, Fitch views STI's capital  ratios as appropriate for its risk profile. Further, Fitch notes that STI once  again performed well under the regulatory stress tests, and received no  objection to its capital plan this year. Fitch also notes that STI has reported  good capital generation over the past 12 months, and its coverage of capital and  reserves to stress test losses is on the higher end of the peer group.  STI's liquidity profile remains stable. Compared with large regional peers,  STI's loan to deposit LTD) ratio is on the higher end, although other liquidity  metrics, percentage of liquid assets and wholesale funding, are better or at the  peer median. STI disclosed that its LCR continues to exceed the Jan. 1, 2016  requirement of 90%.  STI has access to diversified sources of funding, including deposits, FHLB  advances, and access to the capital markets. In addition, STI completed its  first indirect automobile securitization in eight years in 2Q15, taking around  $1bn of relatively low returning assets off the balance sheet. STI has also sold  government guaranteed student loans in the past.  SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES STI's subordinated debt is notched one level below its VR of 'a-' for loss  severity. STI's preferred stock is notched five levels below its VR, two times  for loss severity and three times for non-performance, while STI's trust  preferred securities are notched two times from the VR for loss severity and two  times for non-performance. These ratings are in accordance with Fitch's criteria  and assessment of the instruments non-performance and loss severity risk  profiles and have thus been upgraded due to the upgrade of the VR.  LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS The uninsured deposit ratings of SunTrust Bank are rated one notch higher than  STI's IDR and senior unsecured debt because U.S. uninsured deposits benefit from  depositor preference. U.S. depositor preference gives deposit liabilities  superior recovery prospects in the event of default.  HOLDING COMPANY  STI's IDR and VR are equalized with those of its bank, reflecting its role as  the bank holding company which is mandated in the U.S. to act as a source of  strength for its bank subsidiaries. Ratings are also equalized reflecting the  very close correlation between holding company and subsidiary failure and  default probabilities.  SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR STI has a Support Rating of '5' and Support Rating Floor of 'NF'. In Fitch's  view, STI is not systemically important and therefore, the probability of  support is unlikely. IDRs and VRs do not incorporate any support.   RATING SENSITIVITIES VR, IDRs, AND SENIOR DEBT Fitch envisions limited near-term upward ratings momentum for STI at current  levels. The company's ratings incorporate expectations of gradual improvement in  earnings over time, especially under a higher rate environment, and that capital  will be deployed over time. If capital is maintained at appropriate levels,  asset quality remains good, and STI's earnings performance consistently improves  to levels above the peer average, there could be further upside to STI's  ratings, though this would likely only occur over the medium- to long-term.  Fitch anticipates that if there were any upwards rating potential, it would  likely be capped to a one-notch upgrade.  Conversely, a material deterioration in capital or asset quality may prompt  negative rating action, though Fitch expects some level of mean reversion in  loan losses, as well as a reduction in capital ratios over time.  Long-term  capital targets are expected to remain between 8% and 9.5% for the large  regional bank peer group. For those banks whose long-term capital targets fall  to the lower end of that range, Fitch expects they will also have a superior  earnings profile that provides for adequate capital generation capabilities.  Absent that, there could be negative rating actions.  While not anticipated, greater reliance on more volatile capital markets  revenues may be a constraint to further upside in the company's ratings. On  average, STI's investment banking and trading income accounts for around 7% of  revenues. A sustained reliance of greater than 20% to 25% or being on a  trajectory to doing so may constrain further upside ratings momentum.  Fitch views STI as one of the few large regional banks that is in the position  to do bank-level M&A.  STI has not completed a significant bank acquisition  since 2004. Fitch would evaluate any transaction on its individual merits. As  such, rating implications are dependent on the financial implication, strategic  rationale, and execution risks inherent in any transaction.  SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES The ratings for STI and its operating companies' subordinated debt and preferred  stock are sensitive to any change to STI's VR.     LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS The long- and short-term deposit ratings are sensitive to any change to STI's  long- and short-term IDR.   HOLDING COMPANY  Should STI's holding company begin to exhibit signs of weakness, demonstrate  trouble accessing the capital markets, or have inadequate cash flow coverage to  meet near-term obligations, there is the potential that Fitch could notch the  holding company IDR and VR from the ratings of the operating companies. This is  viewed as unlikely for STI, though, given the strength of the holding company  liquidity profile.  SUPPORT AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR Since STI's Support and Support Rating Floors are '5' and 'NF', respectively,  there is limited likelihood that these ratings will change over the foreseeable  future.  The rating actions are as follows:  Fitch has affirmed the following ratings: SunTrust Banks, Inc. --Long-Term IDR at 'A-'; Outlook Stable;  --Short-Term IDR at 'F1'; --Viability Rating at 'a-'; --Preferred stock at 'BB'; --Senior debt at 'A-'; --Subordinated debt at 'BBB+'; --Short-term debt at 'F1'; --Support at 5; --Support Floor at 'NF'.

The manner of Fitch's  factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains  will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the  requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is  offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of  relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its  advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as  audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports,  engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties,  the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources  with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the  issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports  should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any  third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on  in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete.  Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the  information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and  other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the  work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial  statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings  and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking  and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature  cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current  facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that  were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.

A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security.  This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and  methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore,  ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual,  or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or   a report.

Such fees generally vary from  US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In  certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular  issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a  single annual fee.

IDRs at 'A-/F1'; Outlook Stable,http://www.reuters.com//article/idUSFit975565?type=companyNews
42,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, October 04 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Fifth Third Bancorp's  (FITB) ratings at 'A/F1'. The Rating Outlook is revised to Negative from Stable.  The affirmation reflects the company's conservative risk appetite, solid capital  profile, and good liquidity levels.  The Outlook revision reflects a financial  profile, particularly earnings, that is no longer differentiated from its lower  rated peers.  The rating action follows a periodic review of the large regional banking group,  which includes BB&T Corporation (BBT), Capital One Finance Corporation (COF),  Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (CFG), Comerica Incorporated (CMA), Fifth Third  Bancorp (FITB), Huntington Bancshares Inc. (HBAN), Keycorp (KEY), M&T Bank  Corporation (MTB), MUFG Americas Holding Corporation (MUAH), PNC Financial  Services Group (PNC), Regions Financial Corporation (RF), SunTrust Banks Inc.  (STI), US Bancorp (USB), Wells Fargo & Company (WFC), and Zions Bancorporation  (ZION).  Company-specific rating rationales for the other banks are published separately,  and for further discussion of the large regional bank sector in general, refer  to the special report titled 'Large Regional Bank Periodic Review,' to be  published shortly.  KEY RATING DRIVERS  IDRs, VRs, AND SENIOR DEBT The affirmation reflects the company's conservative risk appetite, solid capital  profile, and good liquidity levels. This is primarily offset by an earnings  profile that has lost some momentum, and no longer outperforms peers.  As such,  Fitch has revised the Rating Outlook to Negative. Resolution of the Outlook will  be contingent on an improved core earnings profile that is in line with  similarly rated peers, and successful execution of ongoing strategic  initiatives.  FITB's earnings, a key rating driver, have historically outpaced peer averages  supported by strong efficiency levels, and good fee-based revenues sources.  Fitch expects FITB's profitability may improve under a more normalized rate  environment, along with its peer banks. In the meantime, FITB appears to have  lost its earnings momentum, and is no longer differentiated from its peers. In  second quarter 2016 (2Q16), FITB reported an ROA of 94bps, below the peer median  of 100bps and below Fitch's long-term expectations for the bank. Excluding  Vantiv-related gains, Fitch calculates an ROA of roughly 90bps in 2Q16, well  below our expectations for FITB. The bank's earnings have been impacted by a  slowdown in refinancing activities, changes to the deposit advance product, and  increased regulatory and compliance-related spending over the past several  years.  Fitch currently views the ownership stake in Vantiv (a payment processing and  technology provider that was spun off from FITB in 2009) favorably, as it  provides for revenue diversification and has provided a considerable level of  earnings to the bank. In 2015, Vantiv contributed a significant 34% of pre-tax  earnings in 2015. Excluding these gains, FITB's core earnings profile is  considerably lower.  The carrying value of FITB's investment in Vantiv was just $390 million at most  recent quarter-end, with a market value of $1.9 billion (based on Vantiv's share  price on June 30, 2016). If FITB were to sell these shares in Vantiv, FITB would  recognize a significant gain, and may also realize up to $1.2 billion in cash  flows related to the dissolution of the existing tax receivable agreement (TRA).  These potential gains are not included in FITB's equity or capital, though it  could provide for a large buffer against unexpected losses if monetized, which  is viewed favorably in the context of the company's capital profile. Offsetting  this, FITB would no longer have the related gains and income to recognize  through income, and its reported earnings would be lower, when holding revenues  and expenses constant.  Fitch views FITB as a company in the midst of a transition, as the company  attempts to pivot its culture and risk management appetite to targeting lower  credit losses through a cycle. FITB, along with its other Ohio-based peers,  performed poorly through the financial crisis with loan losses well in excess of  large regional bank peers, primarily due to due to weak economic conditions in  Michigan before the crisis started, and its exposure to Florida. Since that time, FITB has taken numerous steps to improve its risk profile, and  produce more consistent results in the future. As an example, FITB's loan growth  has been well below the peer median, as the bank is targeting appropriate  risk-adjusted returns. Reflecting the company's pricing discipline, FITB expects  to grow loans, excluding held-for-sale, by only 2% for full-year 2016. Given the  competitive lending environment and relatively weak economic growth, this is  viewed as prudent.  Fitch views the company's strategic priorities favorably, which include growing  fee revenue, streamlining processes to reduce expenses, improving the customer  experience, and investing for the future to deliver strong consistent results  through business cycles. Similar to peers, the bank is redeploying cost savings  and gains into improving its technology as FITB adapts to changing customer  behaviors, and refreshes its internal technological infrastructure. Fitch views  FITB as well positioned to capitalize on the rapidly changing banking  environment given its CEO's prior background in technology.  Underpinning today's rating affirmation, FITB's capital profile remains good  with a Common Equity Tier 1 ratio under Basel III of approximately 9.9%.  Although FITB's CET1 is below the peer median of roughly 10.8%, it is still  viewed as acceptable in absolute terms, and above the fully phased-in  requirement of 7%. Further, unlike some peers, FITB has been building capital,  up 52bps from a year ago, as compared to the peer median of up 3bps. We also  anticipate that FITB's long-term capital targets will be on the higher end as  compared to peers. Fitch expects the large regional bank long-term capital  targets to be generally between 8% and 9.5%, with the exception of WFC.  Fitch also notes that over the past three regulatory stress-testing exercises,  FITB has performed better than the peer median in terms of capital erosion, or  the starting capital ratios less the minimum capital ratios under the severely  adverse scenario.  FITB maintains a solid core funding base. Core deposits (defined as total  deposits less jumbo CDs) represented a sizable 97% of total deposits and 83% of  total funding at June 30, 2016. Short-term wholesale funding now comprises just  3% of total funding. FITB's estimate of the modified LCR was 110% at June 30,  2016, well ahead of the 90% requirement on Jan. 1, 2016. Many of FITB's peers  have yet to publicly disclose their LCR.  At June 30, 2016, FITB reported holding company cash totaled $2.4 billion, more  than enough to cover $750 million of remaining holding company maturities in  2016 and 2017, as well as dividends, interest and other expenses over the next  year. In July 2016, FITB was assigned a 'needs to improve' CRA rating, which means the  bank will be unable to pursue bank acquisitions until the rating is upgraded.  FITB expects its next CRA exam in 4Q16, and is hopeful that the 'needs to  improve' rating will be upgraded. Despite this rating, which prevents bank M&A,  FITB reiterated that bank acquisitions remain a low priority. SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES FITB's subordinated debt is notched one level below its VR of 'a' for loss  severity. FITB's preferred stock is notched five levels below its VR, two times  for loss severity and three times for non-performance, while FITB's trust  preferred securities are notched two times from the VR for loss severity and two  times for non-performance. These ratings are in accordance with Fitch's criteria  and assessment of the instruments non-performance and loss severity risk  profiles and have thus been affirmed due to the affirmation of the VR.  LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS The uninsured deposit ratings of Fifth Third Bank are rated one notch higher  than FITB's IDR and senior unsecured debt because U.S. uninsured deposits  benefit from depositor preference.  U.S. depositor preference gives deposit  liabilities superior recovery prospects in the event of default. HOLDING COMPANY  FITB's IDR and VR are equalized with those of its bank, reflecting its role as  the bank holding company, which is mandated in the U.S. to act as a source of  strength for its bank subsidiaries. Ratings are also equalized reflecting the  very close correlation between holding company and subsidiary failure and  default probabilities.  SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR Since FITB's Support and Support Rating Floors are '5' and 'NF', respectively,  there is limited likelihood that these ratings will change over the foreseeable  future.  RATING SENSITIVITIES VR, IDRs, AND SENIOR DEBT A lack of a sustainable improvement in FITB's earnings profile (without Vantiv  ownership) may lead to a downgrade in FITB's ratings as they have represented a  key rating strength historically, and its performance has been relatively  average over the past couple years. Furthermore, a lack of demonstrated  execution on its strategic initiatives will also lead to downward ratings  pressure.  Fitch expects resolution of the Rating Outlook will be at the outer  end of the 12 to 24 month Outlook horizon period.  FITB's longer-term targets remain unchanged with a 12% to 14% ROTCE ratio and a  1.1% to 1.3% ROA. If FITB successfully executes on its current strategic  investments, and produces improved earnings - in line with the bank's internal  ROA target, the Outlook could be revised back to Stable.  Fitch expects FITB to continue to monetize its ownership stake in Vantiv over  the intermediate term. A complete divestiture would lessen some volatility in  earnings; however, without reinvestment or other organic opportunities, FITB's  earnings profile would no longer benefit from Vantiv-related income and gains,  and ratings could be adversely affected should it not be able to offset the  associated decline.   Fitch anticipates that given its M&A related restrictions, there may not be a  way to efficiently use proceeds from any material sale of the Vantiv ownership.  As such, if FITB were to redeploy a majority of related gains into share  repurchases, this would likely impact FITB's ratings.  FITB has recently announced strategic initiatives to increase its capital market  offerings, in line with efforts at a couple of other large regional banks.  Although Fitch expects securities business will remain relatively low relative  to overall revenues for FITB and the other large regional banks, an outsized  reliance on this more volatile income stream could be viewed negatively from a  ratings perspective.  Given FITB's ratings are at the higher end of the ratings spectrum for the large  regional banks, Fitch does not anticipate any further ratings upward momentum  given the high absolute levels. Fitch currently views more downside risk in  FITB's ratings than upside, as reflected in the Negative Outlook.  SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES The ratings for FITB and its operating companies' subordinated debt and  preferred stock are sensitive to any change to FITB's VR.     LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS The long- and short-term deposit ratings are sensitive to any change to FITB's  long- and short-term IDR.   HOLDING COMPANY  Should FITB's holding company begin to exhibit signs of weakness, demonstrate  trouble accessing the capital markets, or have inadequate cash flow coverage to  meet near-term obligations, there is the potential that Fitch could notch the  holding company IDR and VR from the ratings of the operating companies.  SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR Since FITB's Support and Support Rating Floors are '5' and 'NF', respectively,  there is limited likelihood that these ratings will change over the foreseeable  future.  The rating actions are as follows:  Fitch has affirmed the following ratings: Fifth Third Bancorp --Long-term IDR at 'A'; Outlook Revised to Negative; --Viability Rating at 'a'; --Preferred stock at 'BB+';    --Senior debt at 'A'; --Subordinated debt at 'A-'; --Short-term IDR at 'F1'; --Short-term debt at 'F1'; --Support at '5'; --Support floor at 'NF'. Fifth Third Bank  --Long-term IDR at 'A'; Outlook Revised to Negative; --Viability Rating at 'a'; --Senior debt at 'A'; --Subordinated debt at 'A-'; --Long-term deposits at 'A+'; --Short-term IDR at 'F1'; --Short-term deposits at 'F1'; --Support at '5'; Support floor at 'NF'.

43,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, October 04 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Regions Financial  Corporation (RF)'s ratings at 'BBB'/'F2' reflecting the company's good capital  and liquidity profile, improving earnings, and continued improvement in asset  quality. The Rating Outlook has been revised to Positive from Stable. The rating action follows a periodic review of the large regional banking group,  which includes BB&T Corporation (BBT), Capital One Finance Corporation (COF),  Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (CFG), Comerica Incorporated (CMA), Fifth Third  Bancorp (FITB), Huntington Bancshares Inc. (HBAN), Keycorp (KEY), M&T Bank  Corporation (MTB), MUFG Americas Holding Corporation (MUAH), PNC Financial  Services Group (PNC), Regions Financial Corporation (RF), SunTrust Banks Inc.  (STI), US Bancorp (USB), Wells Fargo & Company (WFC), and Zions Bancorporation  (ZION).  Company-specific rating rationales for the other banks are published separately,  and for further discussion of the large regional bank sector in general, refer  to the special report titled 'Large Regional Bank Periodic Review,' to be  published shortly.  KEY RATING DRIVERS  IDRs, VRs, AND SENIOR DEBT The affirmation reflects RF's good capital and liquidity profile. Fitch views  greater upside in RF's ratings, and has revised the Rating Outlook to Positive  to reflect RF's improving overall credit profile. An upgrade would be predicated  on closing the gap with higher rated peers in terms of profitability and asset  quality.  Fitch observes that profitability to date still lags the peer average, but on a  risk-adjusted basis, Fitch views the earnings profile as more in line with peer  averages. Earnings also incorporate a fairly resilient margin, which compares  favorably to the peer median. RF maintains relatively lower deposit costs, with  loan yields around 16bps better than the peer median.  Further, RF has higher energy-related exposure, particularly to oilfield  services companies, than peers, which is expected given its operating footprint.  Despite a higher exposure to energy than peers, Fitch views the risk as  manageable, and RF has demonstrated success in lowering this exposure with  appropriate reserves.   RF's capital profile remains good with an estimated fully phased-in Common  Equity Tier 1 ratio under Basel III of approximately 11% at June 30, 2016,  around 20bps higher than the peer median. Fitch expects these capital levels  will diminish over time, but will remain above peer averages over the near term  given CCAR-related capital distribution constraints, the lack of strong organic  balance sheet growth, and bank M&A restrictions.  RF has publicly stated its long-term CET1 target is 9.5%. Fitch views RF's  capital planning practices as solid, and are informed by appropriate triggers  and limits. Fitch expects RF to operate above its long-term target over the near  term given the lack of balance sheet growth. RF expects to grow loans less than  3% for the year. Fitch notes that a higher relative capital target is important  in light of weaker capital generation capabilities than peers.  RF's liquidity profile remains solid with a low loan-to-deposit ratio, at 84% at  quarter-end, and one of the lowest of the large regional peer group. This may  provide RF more flexibility in funding loan growth under a more robust economic  environment.  Loan growth over the past year for RF has been muted at roughly 2%. This is  viewed favorably by Fitch given the competitive lending environment. Some of  this loan growth was due to a market slowdown, while the other half was  attributed to RF's self-imposed decision to slow lending in certain sectors,  including CRE, where RF is approaching internal concentration limits. Further,  RF is also de-emphasizing credit-only relationships. Fitch notes that while multi-family and owner-occupied CRE balances are down  from a year ago, RF continues to grow indirect auto and credit card balances.  These portfolios comprise 5% and 1% of total loans, respectively, mitigating  some of the risk inherent in the relatively robust loan growth in these loan  types amidst relatively sluggish economic growth. Fitch notes at June 30, 2016,  0.48% was more than 60 days past due in the indirect auto book, and only 9% has  a FICO score less than 620.  Fitch views RF's deposit franchise as a rating strength, especially in light of  its higher growth footprint. RF has a very low cost of funds, and stands to  benefit from higher than average population growth expectations given its  Southeastern footprint. While depositor behavior under a higher interest rate  environment is difficult to predict, RF's franchises in Alabama, Mississippi,  and Tennessee in particular, where the company holds either the number 1 or  number 2 market shares, may prove more resilient to pressures of higher deposit  costs, and aid the company's earnings profile.  RF's ratings are currently constrained by asset quality. At June 30, 2016, RF's  NPAs were the highest of the peer group due primarily to commercial,  particularly energy-related, and CRE nonaccrual loans. Fitch believes RF's TDR  accounting practices to be more conservative than peers, and notes that 86% of  accruing TDRs are current as of June 30, 2016. Current loan losses remain low and at the peer median in 2Q16, though Fitch  expects them to deteriorate from unsustainably low levels, in part due to RF's  energy-related portfolio. RF reported $3.1 billion in total energy-related  exposure at June 30, 2016, or around 3.8% of the total loan book, on the higher  end of peer averages. Despite some improvement in oil prices from a year ago,  Fitch expects some weakness particularly from its oilfield services portfolio,  which represents approximately 36% of energy outstandings, which is higher than  its peers. RF has built its energy reserves to 9.4% at June 30, 2016, the second  highest level among its peer banks. Further, RF has been very successful in  reducing direct exposure, down 19% from a year ago.  Fitch views energy-related risk as an earnings headwind for RF, and not  necessarily a capital issue. RF anticipates that it will incur between $50  million and $75 million in related losses throughout 2017, and if prices average  below $25 a barrel through the end of 2017, RF could experience additional  losses of $100 million. At June 30, 2016, RF had $225 million in energy-related  reserves against the potential stress losses of up to $175 million through  year-end 2017. Given current prices are averaging around $44 a barrel; realizing  this level of losses appears remote. Fitch expects that RF may benefit from some  reserve releases in this book over time.  In 4Q15, RF was assigned a ""needs to improve"" CRA rating, despite receiving  ""High Satisfactory"" ratings on the CRA components. RF's CRA rating was  downgraded due to the bank's April 2015 consent order with the CFPB related to  overdrafts and Regulation E. Regions Bank had self-reported these matters, and  provided refunds to the affected customers in 2011 and 2012. Nonetheless, the  current CRA rating means the bank will be unable to pursue bank acquisitions  until the CRA rating is upgraded. RF expects its next CRA rating will occur in  2016, but the timing of the exam or the results is unclear. The bank's inability  to pursue M&A is not viewed as a credit negative. SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES RF's subordinated debt is notched one level below its VR of 'bbb' for loss  severity. RF's preferred stock is notched five levels below its VR, two times  for loss severity and three times for non-performance. These ratings are in  accordance with Fitch's criteria and assessment of the instruments  non-performance and loss severity risk profiles and have thus been affirmed due  to the affirmation of the VR.  LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS The uninsured deposit ratings of Regions Bank are rated one notch higher than  RF's IDR and senior unsecured debt because U.S. uninsured deposits benefit from  depositor preference. U.S. depositor preference gives deposit liabilities  superior recovery prospects in the event of default.  HOLDING COMPANY  RF's IDR and VR are equalized with those of its bank, reflecting its role as the  bank holding company, which is mandated in the U.S. to act as a source of  strength for its bank subsidiaries. Ratings are also equalized reflecting the  very close correlation between holding company and subsidiary failure and  default probabilities.  SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR RF has a Support Rating of '5' and Support Rating Floor of 'NF'. In Fitch's  view, RF is not systemically important and therefore, the probability of support  is unlikely. IDRs and VRs do not incorporate any support.   RATING SENSITIVITIES VR, IDRs, AND SENIOR DEBT An upgrade of RF's ratings would be driven by the improvement and maintenance of  core earnings at peer levels combined with a continued reduction in problem  asset levels. Fitch expects the resolution of the rating outlook to be on the  latter part of the 12 to 24 month rating horizon as earnings improvement may be  difficult to achieve over the next twelve months given the low-rate interest  environment.  If overall asset quality continues to modestly improve and further deterioration  in RF's energy book is not outsized relative to the performance of peers, this  may be consistent with an upgrade. However, if RF's energy portfolio performs  noticeably worse than peers, ratings upside may be impacted. Conversely, a sustained reversal of moderating credit trends, combined with a  large decrease in capital, would likely cause the outlook to be revised back to  Stable. Fitch expects it will take some time to manage its capital down to its  long-term capital target of CET1 of 9.5% given CCAR constraints and subdued  organic loan growth expectations. Since RF cannot participate in bank M&A given  its CRA rating, if RF were to become much more aggressive with its capital  distribution plans under CCAR or began to materially grow its balance sheet, its  ratings could be adversely impacted.  Similar to some of its large regional bank peers, RF is continuing to build out  its capital markets capabilities. While these businesses can result in much more  volatile earnings, Fitch expects that capital markets revenues will remain low  relative to total revenues for RF. Outsized growth or contribution from capital  markets-related revenues may impede upwards rating momentum. SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES The ratings for RF and its operating companies' subordinated debt and preferred  stock are sensitive to any change to RF's VR.   LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS The long-and short-term deposit ratings are sensitive to any change to RF's  Long-and Short-Term IDR.  HOLDING COMPANY  Should RF's holding company begin to exhibit signs of weakness, demonstrate  trouble accessing the capital markets, or have inadequate cash flow coverage to  meet near-term obligations, there is the potential that Fitch could notch the  holding company IDR and VR from the ratings of the operating companies.  SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR Since RF's Support and Support Rating Floors are '5' and 'NF', respectively,  there is limited likelihood that these ratings will change over the foreseeable  future.

In issuing and  maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast  information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and  underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch  conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it  in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification  of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are  available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's  factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains  will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the  requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is  offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of  relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its  advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as  audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports,  engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties,  the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources  with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the  issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports  should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any  third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on  in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete.  Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the  information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and  other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the  work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial  statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings  and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking  and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature  cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current  facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that  were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.  The information in this report is provided ""as is"" without any representation or  warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or  any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the  report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security.  This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and  methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore,  ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual,  or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or   a report. The  rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk,  unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or  sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals  identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible  for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes  only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute  for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer  and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be  changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch.  Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a  recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the  adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular  investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to  any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other  obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from  US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In  certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular  issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a  single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000  (or the applicable currency equivalent).
