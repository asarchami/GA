3,"  LONDON, March 4 Britain's healthcare costs watchdog has asked U.S. biotech group Alexion Pharmaceuticals  to explain the high price for its Soliris drug before deciding whether the treatment should be paid for by the state health service.Funding Soliris for the around 200 patients in England it could benefit would cost an estimated 58 million pounds ($97 million) in the first year, rising to 80 million pounds a year in five years time, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) said.Soliris is designed to treat two extremely rare chronic genetic conditions that can damage vital organs including the kidneys, heart and brain and has a U.S. list price of about $440,000 per patient a year.""Drugs for very rare conditions that affect just a few people in the country are inevitably more expensive than for more common diseases,"" said NICE's chief executive Andrew Dillon. ""However, before we can make a confident recommendation for routine use (of Soliris) ... we need more information."" He said that while Soliris is recognised as an effective drug, NICE's independent advisory committee wants more information from Alexion ""on aspects of the manufacturing, research and development costs"" of a rare disease medicine.The committee had also asked the country's taxpayer-funded National Health Service for more general information about the costs of highly specialised treatments, he said. Alexion criticised NICE for further delaying a decision, but said it would continue to work with the costs body.Sales of Soliris are forecast by analysts to reach $3.1 billion a year by 2017. NICE is evaluating the cost effectiveness of Soliris' use in a condition called atypical Haemolytic Uraemic Syndrome (aHUS) that causes severe inflammation of blood vessels and the formation of blood clots in small blood vessels.The drug, given intravenously as initial treatment at a dose of 900 milligrams (mg) for four weeks, and then for maintenance at a higher dose, but with treatments only every 12 to 16 weeks, costs 3,150 pounds per 30 millilitre vial in Britain, giving a treatment cost of 340,200 pounds per adult patient in the first year, according to NICE.The summary product characteristics for the drug also states that ""treatment is recommended to continue for a patient's lifetime, unless discontinuation of treatment is clinically indicated"".",2014-03-04,ALXN,"Mon Mar 3, 2014 | 7:01pm EST",British watchdog wants U.S. biotech Alexion to justify cost of drug,http://www.reuters.com//article/alexion-nice-soliris-idUSL6N0M02RR20140304?type=companyNews

14,"   By Vidya L Nathan, Natalie Grover and Bill Berkrot  Alexion Pharmaceuticals Inc on Wednesday said it agreed to buy Synageva BioPharma Corp for $8.4 billion, more than twice its market value, to expand its offering of potentially high-priced medicines for rare diseases.Alexion's willingness to pay an eye-popping premium for Synageva demonstrates that the appetite for large acquisitions in healthcare continues unabated. It also highlights the attraction of medicines for rare diseases that can command exceptionally high prices with little payer pushback because of  the limited number of patients.Alexion's lone product, Soliris, a treatment for two extremely rare life-threatening conditions, is among the world's most expensive drugs. The medicine, which can cost more than $500,000 per year, generated sales of $2.23 billion in 2014.The companies' combined developmental pipelines would give Alexion eight experimental medicines in clinical trials for 11 diseases, the company said. That includes Synageva's Kanuma, which is awaiting U.S. and European approval to treat a rare and potentially fatal condition that causes a build-up of fat in the blood and liver.Alexion Chief Executive David Hallal expressed confidence that Kanuma sales will eventually exceed $1 billion.The deal would also give Alexion Synageva's SBC-103, an experimental enzyme replacement therapy for a rare genetic disorder that has both orphan status and fast-track designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. That should speed up the approval process and, in the event of approval, confer an additional seven years of marketing exclusivity, an incentive for developing medicines for small patient populations.""I think Alexion wanted to do something big. There aren't many opportunities ... to do that, and so this is their big shot,"" said Paul Yook, portfolio manager at BioShares Biotechnology Funds, which holds stakes in both companies. Yook said the announcement could put Alexion in the takeover crosshairs. ""Anybody who's been looking at them now will have to make a move more quickly if they don't want to acquire Synageva as well.""MORE RAISED EYEBROWS Alexion is offering $115 in cash and 0.6581 of its shares, or $225.92 per Synageva share, more than double its closing price of $95.87 on Tuesday.  ""While some investors may be picking their jaws off the floor at such a valuation, we note that Synageva has only disclosed a fraction of its development efforts,"" Baird Equity Research analyst Christopher Raymond said.Synageva's shares soared on Wednesday, ending regular trading at $203.39, up 112 percent. Alexion shares traded as low as $150.06 before finishing at $155.01, down 8 percent, a sign of investor dissatisfaction with the price the company agreed to pay for Synageva.Paul Hudson, president of AstraZeneca's U.S. operations, speaking at the FT US Healthcare and Life Sciences Conference in New York, said he expects to see ""more raised eyebrows"" over future deal valuations. Whether you end up paying a high valuation is based on ""whether you see some magic that others don’t see,"" he said. The deal would provide a windfall for Baker Brothers Investments, which owns about 32 percent of Synageva and stands to make $2.68 billion.There has been a steady wave of recent deals and takeover efforts in healthcare, including AbbVie's nearly $21 billion deal for Pharmacyclics and Pfizer's planned $16.7 billion purchase of Hospira. In the rare-disease space, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries  bought Auspex Pharmaceuticals for $3.5 billion, and Shire acquired NPS Pharmaceuticals for $5.2 billion. Meanwhile, Teva is pursuing generic drugmaker rival Mylan, which rejected a $43 billion offer and is itself trying to buy Ireland-based Perrigo, which in turn rebuffed Mylan's $34 billion bid.

15,"   By Olivia Oran  The hefty premium Alexion Pharmaceuticals Inc has agreed to pay to acquire Synageva BioPharma Corp highlights how the popularity of so-called orphan drug makers is leading to valuations many investors now deem frothy.Alexion shares fell as much as 10 percent on Wednesday on investor concerns the $8.4 billion cash and stock deal overvalued Synageva, whose drug for a rare and potentially fatal condition that causes a build-up of fat in the blood and liver awaits regulatory approval.Alexion offered Synageva nearly a 140 percent premium, versus an average takeover premium of 41 percent for biotechnology companies so far this year, according to Thomson Reuters data. Other recent big deals involving orphan drug makers that focus on rare diseases include Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd's $3.5 billion purchase of Auspex Pharmaceuticals announced in March and Shire Plc's acquisition of NPS Pharmaceuticals for $5.2 billion in January.Reuters also reported last week that Pfizer Inc had made a preliminary offer for rare-disease drug maker Swedish Orphan Biovitrium AB. Orphan drug companies are seen as attractive because they can typically charge higher prices for their drugs, which serve small patient populations. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration's approval process for these drugs is also often quicker - around 10 months versus at least 1 year for non-orphan drugs. This is because these drugs treat serious or life threatening diseases when other treatment options may not exist. ""Rare-disease companies are profitable businesses and the cost to market a product is pretty low, which makes them attractive targets,"" said Lisa Bayko, an analyst with JMP Securities. ""The drugs seem to sell themselves to some degree."" In turn, major drug companies such as Pfizer, Celgene Corp and Novartis AG are investing heavily in orphan drugs. While rare diseases were historically ignored by large pharmaceutical companies in favor of those with larger patient populations such as cardiac disease and diabetes, orphan made up almost half of the 41 new drugs approved by the FDA last year.  Sales of orphan drugs are expected to grow at an annual rate of almost 11 percent per year through 2020, compared with 4 percent for drugs treating larger populations, according to a recent report from research firm EvaluatePharma. However, some experts argue that orphan drug companies do not necessarily make for the best investments, because they are overvalued by the market and may carry R&D risk. ""When you have large pharmaceutical companies that aren't already in the orphan sector paying large premiums, it enters into really risky territory,"" said Steve Brozak, president of WBB Securities LLC. ""It's going to be problematic for companies and investors that don't understand all the processes of manufacturing, development and patient advocacy.""

It also highlights the attraction of medicines for rare diseases that can command exceptionally high prices with little payer pushback because of  the limited number of patients.Alexion's lone product, Soliris, a treatment for two extremely rare life-threatening conditions, is among the world's most expensive drugs. The medicine, which can cost more than $500,000 per year, generated sales of $2.23 billion in 2014.The companies' combined developmental pipelines would give Alexion eight experimental medicines in clinical trials for 11 diseases, the company said. That includes Synageva's Kanuma, which is awaiting U.S. and European approval to treat a rare and potentially fatal condition that causes a build-up of fat in the blood and liver. Alexion Chief Executive David Hallal expressed confidence that Kanuma sales will eventually exceed $1 billion.The deal would also give Alexion Synageva's SBC-103, an experimental enzyme replacement therapy for a rare genetic disorder that has both orphan status and fast-track designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. That should speed up the approval process and, in the event of approval, confer an additional seven years of marketing exclusivity, an incentive for developing medicines for small patient populations.""I think Alexion wanted to do something big. There aren't many opportunities ... to do that, and so this is their big shot,"" said Paul Yook, portfolio manager at BioShares Biotechnology Funds, which holds stakes in both companies.Yook said the announcement could put Alexion in the takeover crosshairs. ""Anybody who's been looking at them now will have to make a move more quickly if they don't want to acquire Synageva as well."" MORE RAISED EYEBROWS Alexion is offering $115 in cash and 0.6581 of its shares, or $225.92 per Synageva share, more than double its closing price of $95.87 on Tuesday.""While some investors may be picking their jaws off the floor at such a valuation, we note that Synageva has only disclosed a fraction of its development efforts,"" Baird Equity Research analyst Christopher Raymond said. Synageva's shares soared on Wednesday, trading at $204.36. Alexion shares were off more than 10 percent at $151.65, signaling investor dissatisfaction with the price the company agreed to pay for Synageva.Paul Hudson, president of AstraZeneca's U.S. operations, speaking at the FT US Healthcare and Life Sciences Conference in New York, said he expects to see ""more raised eyebrows"" over future deal valuations. Whether you end up paying a high valuation is based on ""whether you see some magic that others don't see,"" he said.The deal would provide a windfall for Baker Brothers Investments, which owns about 32 percent of Synageva and stands to make $2.68 billion.There has been a steady wave of recent deals and takeover efforts in healthcare, including AbbVie's nearly $21 billion deal for Pharmacyclics and Pfizer's  planned $16.7 billion purchase of Hospira.In the rare-disease space, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries   bought Auspex Pharmaceuticals for $3.5 billion, and Shire acquired NPS Pharmaceuticals for $5.2 billion. Meanwhile, Teva is pursuing generic drugmaker rival Mylan , which rejected a $43 billion offer and is itself trying to buy Ireland-based Perrigo, which in turn rebuffed Mylan's $34 billion bid.Lazard and JPMorgan were Alexion's financial advisers, while Goldman Sachs advised Synageva.Wachtell Lipton Rosen & Katz is Alexion's legal counsel, while Sullivan & Cromwell LLP and Ropes & Gray LLP are Synageva's legal counsel.

Alexion, which specialises in high-priced drugs for niche diseases, won a recommendation for two enzyme replacement medicines for rare metabolic diseases known as Strensiq and Kanuma. Alexion acquired the latter product after buying Synageva earlier this year. Santhera Pharmaceuticals had announced that its Raxone drug had also won a positive recommendation for treating Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy.

They also approved Strensiq for patients with pediatric-onset hypophosphatasia (HPP), a drug Alexion had previously acquired. The treatments are awaiting U.S. approval decisions after receiving breakthrough therapy designations from the Food and Drug Administration.""This is sort of a momentous year for us,"" Alexion Chief Executive David Hallal said in an interview. ""We're moving from a one-drug company to a three-drug company, eight, nine years after the launch of our first drug.""LAL-D is a progressive metabolic disease that often leads to liver failure, multi-organ damage and premature death. HPP is a progressive metabolic disease that can lead to deformity of bones, fractures and other skeletal abnormalities, as well as   muscle weakness, seizures, pain, and respiratory failure, causing death in infants and children.Both are ultra-rare diseases defined as occurring in fewer than 20 patients per one million in the general population.Hallal said he expects Kanuma to eventually generate more than $1 billion in annual sales. He declined to provide a sales forecast for Strensiq. He sees a slow sales uptake for the drugs as raising awareness of the diseases and identifying patients is one of the biggest challenges facing the company.

Biotech shares dropped following disappointing news from several key companies including Biogen. The Nasdaq Biotech Index was down 2.2 percent. Giving the S&P 500 its biggest boost, the S&P energy index  jumped 2.3 percent and was on track for its best two-day percentage gain since March. Oil prices reached 2016 highs due to supply constraints and a weak dollar.Gains this week have once again put the S&P 500 within striking distance of record highs reached in May 2015.

Biogen tumbled 12.3 percent to $254.08, and was the biggest drag on the Nasdaq and the S&P 500, after its multiple sclerosis drug failed in a mid-stage study.Alexion dropped 10.7 percent to $138.18 after its drug failed a trial, while Valeant slumped 13 percent to $25.12 after the drugmaker cut its full-year forecast.One of the few bright spots among biotechs was Sarepta , which surged 25 percent on hopes that its muscle-wasting treatment could yet win U.S. approval.Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by 1,930 to 1,085, for a 1.78-to-1 ratio on the upside; on the Nasdaq, 1,532 issues rose and 1,286 fell for a 1.19-to-1 ratio favoring advancers.The S&P 500 posted 43 new 52-week highs and 1 new low; the Nasdaq recorded 80 new highs and 19 new lows.
