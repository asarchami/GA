Argentina and the holdout creditors, who did not participate in the two prior restructurings of the country's 2002 default on approximately $100 billion, failed to come to agreement to avert a repeat default by July 30 despite weeks of talks. Holders of at least 25 percent of the restructured debt from 2005 and 2010 must now give written notice to both Argentina and the trustee to declare the debt securities are ""immediately due and payable.""

That order came from Judge Thomas Griesa, who ordered Argentina to pay holdout creditors in full when it made its next payment to holders of the exchange, or restructured, bonds. ""Pursuant to the court's earlier orders, the trustee continues to hold the funds,"" said the letter, which was seen by IFR. ""The funds are held pending any further court order. The nature and timing of any future court order regarding the funds are not yet known.""Argentina slipped into its second default since 2001 when the midnight Wednesday deadline to make the payment to the exchange holders passed without payment being made.

31,"  SAO PAULO Aug 5 A Brazilian-based investment fund managed by Bank of New York Mellon Corp had to write down more than half of the value of its assets due to losses in investments linked to Argentine government debt, according to a securities filing.The bank's Brazilian fund manager BNY Mellon DTVM said in a filing on Monday that the Brasil Sovereign II Fundo de Investimento de Divida Externa (FIDEX) had invested in credit-linked notes under previous management in 2011. ""We inform that due to the suspension of payments on foreign debt notes issued by Argentina that backed those notes and the need to change the evaluation methodology for some private debt notes in FIDEX's portfolio, provisions for losses have been made on Aug. 1,"" the filing said.

32,"   By Daniel Bases | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Aug 8 Italian retirees holding defaulted Argentine debt from 2002 and who spurned Buenos Aires' restructuring offers are seeking to force Bank of New York Mellon to pay out their court judgments from frozen money due holders who accepted the government's terms.In a further twist in the long-running sovereign debt dispute that has pushed Argentina once again into default, these so-called ""other"" holdouts said in a court filing late Thursday that the $539 million deposit that Argentina made to its indentured trustee, BNY Mellon, should go toward satisfying their U.S. court-awarded claims.The deposit made on June 26, 2014 was deemed illegal by U.S. District Judge Thomas Griesa. In 2012 Griesa ruled Argentina could not make coupon payments on its restructured debt without also paying concurrently a group of holdout investors, separate from the Italians, an award of $1.33 billion plus interest.Griesa ordered BNY Mellon to leave the money untouched until further instruction.This group of holdouts, mainly made up of Italian pensioners, argue that the court has jurisdiction over BNY Mellon and therefore can go after that money, otherwise defined as an attachment, that has been sitting in its account held at the Central Bank of Argentina in Buenos Aires. ""That the Republic's funds are held in BNY Mellon's bank account located outside of New York is of no moment,"" the Italians argued.""Based on the forgoing, an order should be issued directing BNY Mellon to turnover to Plaintiffs the $539 million, or so much of it as is sufficient to satisfy their judgments, plus post-judgement interest,"" the Italians' lawyers wrote. There are approximately 40 plaintiffs included in the Italian group. Their judgments for $150 million on their principal investment were awarded in 2007.After Argentina's 2002 default, the interest rate accruing on the Italian-held bonds under that judgment is 9 percent, the limit allowed under New York law, said the lead lawyer for the Italians, Anthony Costantini, from the firm of Duane Morris in New York.Argentina and the holdouts, led by NML Capital Ltd, an affiliate of Elliott Management Corp and Aurelius Capital Management, failed to settle their dispute by July 30, causing the default on around $29 billion in debt restructured in 2005 and 2010. This latest lawsuit, based upon an attachment argument against BNY Mellon, differs from at least three lawsuits filed in the last two weeks by investors who are riding the coattails of the Elliott/Aurelius judgment, which was based upon the principle of pari passu, or equal treatment. These are referred to as ""me too"" lawsuits.In the case of the Italians, by design or accident, they are  following the argument made by Buenos Aires in a legal notice published in U.S. newspapers on Thursday that exchange bondholders should sue BNY Mellon for their coupon payments.Argentina argues it is not in default because it paid the money on bonds restructured in 2005 and 2010, seemingly leaving its trustee bank BNY Mellon to deal with any legal fallout.Griesa ordered Argentina and the Elliott/Aurelius camp to appear in court on Friday at 3 p.m. (1900 GMT) to hold a hearing ""regarding recent statements"" made by the Republic.

The regional landesbanks, which are state-backed, have traditionally focused on providing wholesale banking services to the country's 400-strong network of community-owned savings banks.Helaba said on Wednesday it planned to open a representative office in Singapore this year to support German small and medium-sized companies, known as the ""Mittelstand,"" which are the backbone of the country's manufacturing strength.BNY Mellon would act as an international sales partner for all the joint-venture partners, promoting their brands in the Asia-Pacific region.Helaba and the savings banks would route letters of credit, used for trade finance, from German importers via BNY Mellon’s branch network. ""This deal helps connect the famed Mittelstand with the fastest growing region in the world,"" Ian Stewart, the chief executive of BNY Mellon's treasury services said in a statement.BNY Mellon has a longstanding relationship with Germany’s savings banks, having acted as one of their partner banks for almost 50 years. Helaba also said its strong capital base put it in a strong position for a health check of the banking sector in the coming weeks, a precursor to the European Central Bank's taking over responsibility for supervision of euro zone banks in November. Some of Germany's other landesbanks ran into difficulties in the financial crisis and are still struggling with reorganizations and European Union restrictions on their business activity.Helaba and Stuttgart-based LBBW, Germany's largest landesbank, which has already completed a revamp in the wake of the crisis, both aim to broaden services to corporate clients. ""There is a dichotomy within the landesbank sector, with some landesbanks like Helaba and LBBW investing, while others can't invest or aren't allowed to invest,"" said one senior landesbank banker.Unlike some landesbanks, Helaba played it safe in the run up to the financial crisis, avoiding an expansion into investment banking or risky investments that caused the collapse of WestLB and state bailouts for other landesbanks such as BayernLB BAYLB.UL, which the EU has blocked from expanding in Asia.

Helaba also said its strong capital base put it in a strong position for a health check of the banking sector in the coming weeks, a precursor to the European Central Bank's taking over responsibility for supervision of euro zone banks in November.Some of Germany's other landesbanks ran into difficulties in the financial crisis and are still struggling with reorganisations and European Union restrictions on their business activity.Helaba and Stuttgart-based LBBW, Germany's largest landesbank, which has already completed a revamp in the wake of the crisis, both aim to broaden services to corporate clients.""There is a dichotomy within the landesbank sector, with some landesbanks like Helaba and LBBW investing, while others can't invest or aren't allowed to invest,"" said one senior landesbank banker.Unlike some landesbanks, Helaba played it safe in the run up to the financial crisis, avoiding an expansion into investment banking or risky investments that caused the collapse of WestLB and state bailouts for other landesbanks such as BayernLB , which the EU has blocked from expanding in Asia.

46,"   By Tim McLaughlin | BOSTON  BOSTON BNY Mellon Corp, the world's largest custody bank, said on Friday it began earlier this month charging clients 0.20 percent on euro-denominated deposits that recently totaled about $33 billion.BNY Mellon initiated the charge on Oct. 1, reflecting a recent move by the European Central Bank to charge 20 basis points on deposits in hopes of persuading banks to lend more money to businesses and consumers.""Many institutions started to charge for deposits,"" BNY Mellon Chief Financial Officer Todd Gibbons said. ""We're kind of in the middle of the pack.""Since imposing the 0.20 percent charge, there has been some decline in euro-denominated deposits at the bank, he said.Matt Eagan, a portfolio manager at Loomis Sayles, said his bond funds have been repatriating cash back to the United States to avoid getting charged on bond interest payments that might otherwise be parked at a European bank.  ""Our clients don't want to get charged for deposits in Europe,"" Eagan said.BNY Mellon reported $221.7 billion in average deposits at the end of September. And the bank said 15 percent of that amount was in euro-denominated deposit liabilities.Banks typically pay customers for their deposits, but that amount has been paltry amid an environment of prolonged, rock-bottom interest rates. The ECB's charge on deposits is designed to spur economic activity. In June, the ECB took the extraordinary step of charging banks 0.10 percent to park their money at the central bank. And in September, that negative rate was increased to 0.20 percent in a move to jump start a flagging European economy.As of Sept. 30, BNY Mellon had $92.3 billion in interest-bearing deposits with the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks. That is down from $106 billion at the end of June. Gibbons declined to say how much of the bank's deposits were with the ECB. In 2011, BNY Mellon told some of its biggest depositors, hedge funds and other asset managers, that it would charge them a nominal fee of 0.13 percentage points a year on deposits in excess of $50 million. The move came amid the Greek debt crisis and the U.S. debt ceiling debate. The financial turmoil spurred big bank clients to sell riskier assets and to shift the proceeds into the shelter of their bank accounts.And in 2012, the bank openly talked about charging clients on their euro deposits as jittery investors felt more comfortable parking their cash rather than buying stocks and bonds. But no decision was made at the time. In the recently ended third quarter, BNY Mellon's net interest margin - largely the difference between what the bank pays on deposits and what it earns on the money through investing - was 0.94 percent compared with 1.16 percent in the year-earlier quarter.

47,"   By Nate Raymond | NEW YORK  NEW YORK A U.S. appeals court on Wednesday dismissed Argentina's appeal of an order directing Bank of New York Mellon Corp (BK.N) to hold onto $539 million the country deposited for its restructured bondholders.The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York in a brief order said it lacked jurisdiction over the appeal as the August ruling by U.S. District Judge Thomas Griesa was a clarification rather than modification of his earlier rulings on the matter.Griesa had ruled that the $539 million that Argentina deposited in June with BNY Mellon for bondholders who participated in two sovereign debt restructurings was ""illegal,"" and in an August order, directed the bank to retain the funds.The judge, in his August ruling, also said BNY Mellon's retention of the funds would not violate his prior orders or subject it to liability.A spokesman for BNY Mellon did not immediately respond to a request for comment, nor did a U.S. lawyer for Argentina. Argentina defaulted in July after refusing to honor court orders to pay $1.33 billion plus interest to U.S. hedge funds suing for full payment on bonds following its earlier 2002 default. The hedge funds, led by NML and Aurelius Capital Management, had spurned the country's 2005 and 2010 debt restructurings, which resulted in exchanges for about 92 percent of the country's defaulted debt. Investors who exchanged bonds were paid less than 30 cents on the dollar. The country's most recent default came after the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear Argentina's appeal of a ruling that it must pay the holdouts when it paid holders of the exchanged bonds.Griesa subsequently blocked BNY Mellon from processing a $539 million interest payment on what the country says is over $28 billion in debt.  The order sent Argentina on a course to default after no settlement was reached.A later order, the one Argentina appealed, set out BNY Mellon's responsibilities to hold onto the money.BNY Mellon, which filed a brief in the case, said Griesa's order helped protect it from liability, as ""nearly every economic stakeholder in this litigation has either sued or threatened to sue"" the bank, including Argentina.

57,"  NEW YORK A U.S. judge refused on Monday to require Bank of New York Mellon Corp (BK.N) to turn over to holders of defaulted Argentine bonds any of the $539 million the country deposited to pay creditors who participated in its past restructurings.U.S. District Judge Thomas Griesa in New York said since the funds were outside the United States in BNY Mellon's accounts at Argentina's central bank, turnover would not be authorized under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act.""In dealing with what can be subjected to turnover, the FSIA simply does not mention property located outside the United States,"" Griesa wrote.The motion was brought largely by various Italian citizens who purchased Argentina's bonds. Representatives for the bank, Argentina and the holdout bondholders seeking the handover did not respond to requests for comment. The ruling came a week after a U.S. appeals court dismissed Argentina's appeal of an order directing BNY Mellon to hold onto the $539 million, which the country deposited in June for bondholders who participated in two sovereign debt restructurings.Griesa's decision to block the payment, which he called ""illegal,"" sent Argentina on a course to default in July after no settlement was reached. The default came as Argentina refused to honor court orders to pay $1.33 billion plus interest to U.S. hedge funds suing for full payment on bonds following its earlier 2002 default.The hedge funds, led by NML and Aurelius Capital Management, had spurned the country's 2005 and 2010 debt restructurings, which resulted in exchanges for about 92 percent of the country's defaulted debt. Investors who exchanged bonds were paid less than 30 cents on the dollar. The country's most recent default came after the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear Argentina's appeal of a ruling that it must pay the holdouts when it paid holders of the exchanged bonds.

BNY Mellon said the so-called Wells notice came after SEC staff provided a similar notice in the third quarter of 2014 to some current and former employees about possible charges.A Wells notice indicates the SEC believes civil charges may be warranted and gives a recipient a chance to mount a defense.

The bank said it is cooperating with the investigation and did not believe the outcome of the investigation will materially affect its business or finances. It is unclear which sovereign wealth funds are at issue or which employees could face charges. A spokesman for BNY Mellon declined to comment Tuesday beyond the disclosure filing, and representatives of the SEC did not respond to requests for comment.The SEC had in 2011 sent letters to several financial institutions asking for information about their business with state-owned investment funds as part of a foreign bribery probe.

101,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, May 19 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has upgraded the Long-Term IDR of The  Bank of New York Mellon (BNYM) and related U.S. insured depository institutions  (IDIs) to 'AA' from 'AA-'. The Rating Outlooks on the Long-Term IDRs are Stable.  Fitch has also downgraded the support ratings of The Bank of New York Mellon  Corporation (BK) and BNYM in line with our view of sovereign support. BK's and  BNYM's viability ratings are unaffected in today's rating action. A full list of  rating actions follows at the end of this rating action commentary.  The upgrade of BNYM's (and related U.S. IDIs) ratings reflects the expected  implementation of total loss absorbing capital (TLAC) requirements for U.S.  Global Systemically Important Banks (G-SIBs) and the presence of a substantial  debt buffer in the holding company. Fitch also believes that, in line with our Support Rating (SR) definition of  '5', extraordinary external support, while possible, can no longer be relied  upon for BK and its subsidiaries. We have, therefore, downgraded their Support  Ratings (SR) to '5' from '1' and revised their Support Rating Floors (SRF) to  'No Floor' from 'A'. The rating actions are in conjunction with Fitch's review of sovereign support  for banks globally, which the agency announced in March 2014. In line with its  expectations announced in March last year and communicated regularly since then,  Fitch believes legislative, regulatory and policy initiatives have substantially  reduced the likelihood of sovereign support for U.S., Swiss and European Union  commercial banks. At the same time, Fitch has taken into account progress with  the U.S. single point of entry (SPE) resolution regime and TLAC implementation  for U.S. G-SIBs. KEY RATING DRIVERS - IDRs AND SENIOR DEBT The VRs remain equalized between BK and its material operating subsidiaries,  namely BNYM. The common VR of BK and its operating companies reflects the  correlated performance, or failure rate between the BK and these subsidiaries.  Fitch takes a group view on the credit profile from a failure perspective, while  the IDR reflects each entity's non-performance (default) risk on senior debt.  Fitch believes that the likelihood of failure is roughly equivalent, while the  default risk given at the operating company would be lower given TLAC. All U.S.  bank subsidiaries carry a common VR, regardless of size, as U.S. banks are  cross-guaranteed under the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and  Enforcement Act (FIRREA).  The Long-Term IDRs for the material U.S. operating entities are one notch above  BK's to reflect Fitch's belief that the U.S. single point of entry (SPE)  resolution regime, the likely implementation of total loss absorbing capital  (TLAC) requirements for U.S. G-SIBs, and the presence of substantial holding  company debt reduces the default risk of domestic operating subsidiaries' senior  liabilities relative to holding company senior debt. In our view these buffers  would provide substantial protection to senior unsecured obligations in the  domestic operating entities in the event of group resolution, as they could be  used to absorb losses and recapitalize operating companies. Therefore,  substantial holding company debt reduces the likelihood of default on operating  company senior obligations. As at end-2014, BK had hybrid and senior debt as a  percent of risk-weighted assets (RWA) of approximately 11%, sufficiently close  enough to meeting its Pillar 1 capital requirement.  The 'F1+' Short-Term IDRs of BK's bank subsidiaries reflects the substantial  liquidity at the banks and typically higher core deposit funding, further  liquidity resources at BK that could be extended to the bank and access to  further contingent liquidity sources such as Federal Home Loan Bank advances.  RATING SENSITIVITIES -IDRs AND SENIOR DEBT IDRs and senior debt are sensitive to any changes in the VR.  KEY RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES - SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR  The SR and SRF reflect Fitch's view that senior creditors can no longer rely on  receiving full extraordinary support from the sovereign in the event that BK  becomes non-viable. In Fitch's view, implementation of the Dodd Frank Orderly  Liquidation Authority legislation is now sufficiently progressed to provide a  framework for resolving banks that is likely to require holding company senior  creditors participating in losses, if necessary, instead of or ahead of the  company receiving sovereign support. Any upward revision to the SR and SRF would be contingent on a positive change  in the U.S.'s propensity to support its banks. While not impossible, this is  highly unlikely in Fitch's view.  KEY RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES - DEPOSIT RATINGS The upgrade of BK's deposit ratings is based on the upgrade of their IDRs.  Deposit ratings are one notch higher than senior debt reflecting the deposits'  superior recovery prospects in case of default given depositor preference in the  U.S.  Fitch has upgraded the following ratings:  The Bank of New York Mellon BNY Mellon National Association BNY Mellon Trust Delaware The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, National Association --Long-Term IRD to 'AA' from 'AA-'; Outlook Stable; --Long-Term Deposits to 'AA+' from 'AA'; The Bank of New York Mellon --Long-Term senior debt to 'AA' from 'AA-'.

112,"  (Adds Bank of New York Mellon statement, Chesapeake closing stock price)By Jonathan StempelNEW YORK, July 10 A U.S. federal judge on Friday ordered Chesapeake Energy Corp to pay $379.7 million to bond investors, after the natural gas company waited too long to tell them of its plan to redeem their $1.3 billion of bonds six years early.U.S. District Judge Paul Engelmayer in Manhattan agreed with bond trustee Bank of New York Mellon Corp that holders of Chesapeake's 6.775 notes maturing in 2019 were entitled to a special ""make-whole"" price because of the early redemption.The payout is more than triple the roughly $100 million that Chesapeake hoped to distribute in ""restitutionary"" damages.It originally argued that its March 15, 2013 redemption notice entitled it to redeem the notes at face value, but a federal appeals court in November said that notice came one month late. Bank of New York Mellon acted on behalf of a variety of hedge funds and other bondholders such as Ares Management LLC, Aurelius Capital Management LP, P. Schoenfeld Asset Management LP and Taconic Capital Advisors LP.""We are pleased with the court's decision vindicating the noteholders' interests,"" bank spokesman Kevin Heine said. Chesapeake spokesman Gordon Pennoyer declined to comment.Shares of Chesapeake closed down 31 cents, or 2.7 percent, at $11.37 in Friday trading.The redemption was intended to help Chesapeake reduce a debt burden that the Oklahoma City-based company had accumulated under former Chief Executive Aubrey McClendon, and offset natural gas prices that had fallen to a decade low. But Engelmayer, whose original ruling in Chesapeake's favor was reversed by the appeals court, said investors were entitled to hold Chesapeake to its obligations under the bond indenture, rather than accept lesser sums.""Investors who decided to buy (or hold) the 2019 notes were beneficiaries of a contract,"" he wrote. ""The interest in respecting investors' legitimate expectations therefore supports a payout keyed to the indenture's treatment of redemptions after March 15, 2013.""The notes were redeemed in May 2013 as part of a refinancing, and Chesapeake recorded a $33 million loss at the time.The case is Chesapeake Energy Corp v. Bank of New York Mellon Trust Co, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 13-01582.

146,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, April 22 (Fitch) The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK)  controlled its cost base in the first quarter of 2016 (1Q16) and reported net  income of $804 million on revenue of $3.7 billion. Revenues were flat from the  linked quarter and down modestly compared to the year-ago period. BK continues  to focus on holding down its expenses, which remains the key driver for  producing positive operating leverage, according to Fitch Ratings. BK's 1Q16 net income equated to a 0.93% annualized return on average assets  (ROAA) up from both 0.86% in the sequential quarter and 0.88% a year ago. The  company's adjusted 1Q16 annualized return on average common equity (ROACE) was  9.7%, up from the 8.9% it generated in 4Q15 and 9.2% in 1Q15. BK's returns this  quarter were stronger than the other U.S. Globally Systemic Important Banks  (G-SIBs), reporting to date, which averaged ROACE of 7.3%. These banks were  affected by volatile trading conditions and higher credit costs related to  energy loans, which had less of an impact on BK given its business model. Total fee revenues were up 1% on a linked-quarter and down 1% on a  year-over-year basis. Linked-quarter results mainly reflect improvements in  depositary receipts due to higher dividend fees and lower money market fee  waivers in investment management, clearing services and corporate trust, offset  somewhat by seasonally weaker performance fees and lower investment management  fees. Year-over-year results were affected by weaker foreign exchange trading  and lower asset management fees due to net outflows, offset somewhat by  lease-related gains and lower money market waivers. Management indicated that  roughly half of money market fee waivers have been recovered following the Fed's  December rate increase. Fitch regards overall performance to be stable. Net interest revenue (NIR) was up 1% on a sequential basis and was up 5%  year-over-year due to 2- and 4- basis point (bp) improvements in the net  interest margin (NIM), respectively, to 101bps. NIM expansion was mainly driven  by the Fed's December rate hike, which lifted yields on cash investments and  floating rate loans, offset by slightly higher deposit costs and interest rate  hedges. Management noted deposit betas experienced were somewhat lower than  anticipated, which led to lower deposit cost increases relative to the Fed rate  increase. Fitch continues to believe BK's NIR is quite sensitive to further  movements in short-term interest rates. Expenses were down 2% sequentially and 3% year-over-year, as BK remained focused  on driving incremental improvements across the company, leading to reductions in  nearly all reported expense categories. BK continues to approach expense  management as an ongoing process. During the quarter, it moved staff to  lower-cost locations, brought more technology development in-house, and lowered  its real estate footprint relative to previous quarters. Fitch believes that in  a stronger rate and economic environment, much of the work BK has done on the  expense front will become more evident through further increases in operating  leverage.  Management indicated there could be some expense pressure for the remainder of  the year due to regulatory investments needed to address deficiencies identified  in BK's resolution plan. Regulators identified deficiencies related to BK's  plans for continuing to provide critical services throughout resolution under  Title I of Dodd-Frank (bankruptcy). Additionally, BK must also make progress on  deficiencies in its legal entity rationalization framework by the Oct. 1, 2016  resubmission deadline. Fitch does not view the lack of acceptance of BK's  resolution plan by regulators to be indicative of the company's current and  ongoing financial health. BK's ratings incorporate the expectation that it will  satisfy the regulators' requirements around its resolution planning.  BK's assets under management (AUM) through 1Q16 were $1.64 trillion, which is up  1% from 4Q15. The result was driven by modest net inflows in liability-driven  investments, offset by outflows of index and equity investments. Compared to  1Q15, AUM was down 5% due to unfavorable currency effects and net outflows from  equity, index, and cash funds. Assets under custody and administration (AUC/A)  were up 1% sequentially due to net new business and favorable currency effects.  AUC/A totaled $29.1 trillion at the end of 1Q16.  BK's fully phased-in Basel III CET1 of 9.8% (advanced approach) reported at the  end of 1Q16 improved by 30bps sequentially. The increase in CET1 was primarily  attributed to organic capital generation while risk-weighted assets under the  advanced approach increased slightly. Other transitional Basel III capital  ratios remain solid despite modestly decreasing due to additional phase-in of  the full rules. BK also continues to exceed the fully phased-in liquidity  coverage ratio (LCR) requirement. The company continues to make progress toward achieving compliance with the U.S.  supplementary leverage ratio (SLR), BK's binding constraint capital ratio,  having now reached the required ratio at the consolidated level. BK reported a  consolidated 5.1% SLR, which is up 20bps from the prior quarter. BK also  reported that its main bank subsidiary, The Bank of New York Mellon, had an  estimated 5.2% SLR, which improved 40bps during the quarter. Improvements were  driven by capital generation and a reduction in average deposits during the  quarter likely due in part to the Fed's rate movement, though period-end  balances spiked due to clients 'dressing up' their balance sheets for financial  reporting.  In Fitch's view, BK has thus far held off from implementing more broad measures  to push client deposits off its balance sheet, preferring to wait until closer  to the rule implementation date to possibly take more forceful actions. U.S.  rules will require BK to have at least 5% at the holding company and 6% at the  bank level. Fitch continues to believe that BK has adequate levers and time to  bring itself into compliance well ahead of required implementation, as  demonstrated this quarter by the achievement of compliance at the holding  company level.

166,"   By Diptendu Lahiri  Bank of New York Mellon Corp reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit as expenses dropped 1.4 percent, and the world's largest custody bank said on Thursday it expected costs to drop as much as 2 percent in 2016.The bank, whose shares rose as much as 4.7 percent in morning trading, has been under pressure from activist investors to cut costs to help make up for sluggish revenue growth in the face of low interest rates.Activist hedge fund Marcato Capital Management criticized the bank last year for having a ""bloated"" payroll. Marcato owned about 0.99 percent of BNY Mellon's stock as of June 30.Train Fund Management LP, which had a 3.02 percent stake as of June 30, has praised the bank for its progress and said its leadership had demonstrated the will to improve performance.""We are getting a tailwind to the expense base from the strength of the dollar, and specifically the move in sterling because we do have a fairly large expense base in sterling,"" Chief Financial Officer Todd Gibbons said on a post-earnings call with analysts.  The bank said its non-interest expenses fell to $2.64 billion in the third quarter ended Sept. 30 from $2.68 billion a year earlier as the dollar's strength helped to reduce software, equipment, legal, occupancy and business development costs.BNY Mellon said it expected costs to drop by 1-2 percent in 2016. It had earlier expected full-year expenses to be ""flat to down"" compared with 2015. The bank's net profit jumped 18.8 percent to $974 million, or 90 cents per share, from $820 million, or 74 cents per share, a year earlier.Excluding items, the company earned 90 cents per share, beating the average analyst estimate of 81 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Adjusted revenue rose about 3.6 percent to $3.93 billion, beating the average estimate of $3.86 billion.
