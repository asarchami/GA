3,"  By Bill BerkrotJan 14 Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc  will report about $400 million in U.S. sales of its high-profile eye drug Eylea for the fourth quarter of 2013, bringing the total for the year to about $1.4 billion with lots of room for future sales growth, the U.S. biotech company's chief executive said on Tuesday.Regeneron CEO Len Schleifer called the Eylea franchise far from mature and said sales of the drug have ""plenty of room for growth"" in both the United States and Europe through approvals for additional uses and other initiatives.Schleifer also said the company has the potential for five major regulatory submissions or approvals in the next five years, including expanded approvals for Eylea, as well as drugs for rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, atopic dermatitis and its closely watched drug to lower ""bad"" LDL cholesterol from a highly promising new class of medicines called PCSK9 inhibitors. Regeneron shares jumped more than 9 percent following Schleifer's comments during a presentation at the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco.The $400 million in U.S. fourth-quarter sales is up from $363 million in the third quarter despite holidays in the period that cut down on doctor visits. Regeneron reports U.S. sales of the drug used to treat wet age-related macular edema - the leading cause of blindness in the elderly - while Bayer AG  sells Eylea in Europe.Sales growth of Eylea has slowed from its rocket-like rise following a late 2011 approval in part because patients who have been taking the drug for several months typically move to less-frequent injections. Regeneron expects applications seeking approval of the PCSK9 cholesterol fighter, alirocumab, to be filed in Europe in early 2015 and for the United States later that year, the CEO said.Schleifer said he believes the drug could win initial approval before completion of a lengthy heart safety study as long as that study is well underway. Regeneron is developing the drugs in its pipeline in partnership with French drugmaker Sanofi, which owns about 16 percent of the biotech and pays the lion's share of research and development expenses for the joint projects.Sanofi is expected to spend more than $1 billion on the Regeneron pipeline in 2014, Schleifer said.""We have lots going on,"" he added.Regeneron shares were up $24.76, or 9.2 percent, at $293.44 in afternoon trading on Nasdaq.

5,"  * Will look seriously at L'Oreal deal if opportunity arises* Sanofi sees big promise in drugs developed with Regeneron* Expects sizeable MS drug sales, despite Lemtrada setback* Diabetes franchise to demonstrate growth beyond 2015 - CEOBy Ben HirschlerDAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 24 Buying back L'Oreal's  9 percent stake in Sanofi could be ""very accretive"" for the French drugmaker, although the idea remains speculative as the $12 billion holding has yet to be put up for sale, Sanofi's CEO said.Investor attention has focused increasingly on a potential realignment of shareholdings that may see Sanofi making a debt-funded repurchase of L'Oreal's stake in a move analysts believe should boost the pharmaceutical group's earnings.Such a deal could provide Sanofi with a useful lift as it seeks to return to growth after a difficult 2013 that featured problems in Brazil and several product setbacks. ""If you get the chance you are certainly going to look seriously at it - but it is an 'if, if, if' situation,"" Sanofi Chief Executive Chris Viehbacher told Reuters on Friday on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.""It could very well be, when you get there, that it could be a very accretive thing to do.""L'Oreal's CEO Jean-Paul Agon said last year the cosmetics company could buy back the 29.5 percent stake that Swiss food group Nestle holds in it, if L'Oreal in turn sells the 9-billion-euro ($12 billion) stake it owns in Sanofi.Agon reaffirmed last week that his group had the firepower to enable it to buy Nestle's stake. Restrictions on Nestle selling down its L'Oreal holding end in April. Viehbacher, who will unveil full-year results next month, said his group had strong growth drivers in vaccines, rare diseases, animal health and consumer health products, adding that a lot of the focus for 2014 would also be on the promising drug pipeline.In particular, he highlighted the potential of a new kind of cholesterol drug and two immunology medicines being developed by U.S. biotech firm Regeneron Pharmaceuticals. Sanofi has a stake in Regeneron and an option to increase it further. MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS Sanofi suffered a blow last month when its Lemtrada multiple sclerosis (MS) treatment failed to win approval from U.S. regulators, but Viehbacher said he remained confident that MS would develop into an important business.Lemtrada will still be available in other markets and the company also has another MS drug, Aubagio, which is doing well.""The MS market is not quite so skewed to the U.S. as it is in other areas and the markets in Europe and Canada are huge. Aubagio is also going well. The MS market is expected to be about $14 billion by 2017, so if you get only 10 percent market share you are going to have quite sizeable products,"" Viehbacher said.Some investors are nervous about Sanofi's outlook over the next few years because its growth still depends heavily on the top-selling diabetes treatment Lantus, which could face so-called biosimilar competition in 2015.Viehbacher, however, played down the threat, pointing to uncertainties over market acceptance of such copycat biotech drugs - which are similar to but not exact copies of the original - and the fact Sanofi had a promising follow-on to Lantus in development.""We see our diabetes franchise being able to demonstrate growth beyond 2015,"" he said.",2014-01-24,REGN,"Fri Jan 24, 2014 | 6:51am EST","Sanofi CEO says buying L'Oreal's stake could be ""very accretive""",http://www.reuters.com//article/davos-sanofi-idUSL5N0KY0P920140124?type=companyNews
6,"  * L'Oreal does not need to sell Sanofi stake for Nestle deal* Hopes recede for debt-funded buyback of stake by Sanofi* Sanofi may still proceed with separate buyback - analysts* Drugmaker may also lift holding in U.S. biotech RegeneronBy Natalie HuetPARIS, Feb 11 French drugmaker Sanofi  will face market scrutiny over what it plans to do with its cash as the prospect of a massive buyback of its shares held by L'Oreal fades.French cosmetics firm L'Oreal and Nestle loosened a 40-year partnership on Tuesday when L'Oreal said it would buy 8 percent of its capital for 6.5 billion euros ($9 billion) from the Swiss food group - but did not need to sell any of its Sanofi shares to fund the deal.L'Oreal thus remains Sanofi's biggest shareholder with a stake of close to 9 percent, worth about $12 billion, and its Chief Executive Jean-Paul Agon told a conference call that L'Oreal was ""very happy"" with that situation.Shares in Sanofi dropped nearly 2 percent after the deal was announced, reflecting disappointment over the lost opportunity for the drugmaker to proceed with a debt-funded share buyback that would have substantially boosted its earnings per share. They later recovered to stand unchanged by 1145 GMT.Deutsche Bank analyst Mark Clark said buying back L'Oreal's 9 percent stake would increase Sanofi's earnings per share by 6 to 8 percent. It remains unclear whether L'Oreal will buy back more of Nestle's holding in the future, he said, noting that this would likely require selling down the Sanofi stake.It was disappointing for the market that L'Oreal will only buy back some of the Nestle stake - for which it did not need to sell Sanofi shares - and it seemed to signal an intention to retain its Sanofi holding over the long run, he said.""It doesn't rule anything out in the future, but people will conclude it reduces the chances of Sanofi buying back that 9 percent stake in due course,"" Clark said. For the time being, the news increases pressure on Sanofi to clearly state what it plans to do with its cash pile, said Berenberg analyst Alistair Campbell.""I think Sanofi would preferably like to invest in bolt-on acquisitions to strengthen the business - they've always been clear on that front - but I also think you could well see them at some stage commit to a share buyback of their own,"" he said.Campbell expects Sanofi to have 3 billion euros in excess cash this year and to use 2 billion to launch a share buyback programme unrelated to the fate of L'Oreal's holding. RAISE REGENERON STAKE? Citi analysts, meanwhile, say that Sanofi could pump the free cash into new partnerships with biotechs, such as the deal it recently struck with U.S. company Alnylam, as it strives to refill its pipeline after many patent expiries.Sanofi has consistently said it aimed to spend 1 to 2 billion euros each year on bolt-on acquisitions. But Chief Executive Chris Viehbacher said during the company's quarterly results last Thursday that the sky-high price tags of biotech companies with late-stage drugs in their pipeline made acquisitions hard to justify.In the meantime, analysts say Sanofi might prefer deals where it can gradually increase its stake in a company depending on how its drugs fare in clinical trials.Sanofi has hinted in the past that it could use its cash to raise its stake in U.S. company Regeneron Pharmaceuticals , its partner on several promising products, including a potential multi-billion dollar cholesterol drug.Viehbacher said in September Sanofi could look at raising its stake in Regeneron from about 16 percent to as much as 30 percent.Raising its stake in Regeneron beyond the 20 percent threshold and consolidating related income would cost Sanofi 1 billion euros but would boost earnings by 3 percent from 2015, Citi analyst Peter Verdult wrote.A spokeswoman for Sanofi noted the company had bought back more than 1.6 billion euros of shares in 2013 but she declined to comment on the L'Oreal-Nestle deal or on Sanofi's future use of cash.",2014-02-11,REGN,"Tue Feb 11, 2014 | 7:37am EST",Sanofi use of cash scrutinised as L'Oreal stake buyback fades,http://www.reuters.com//article/sanofi-cash-idUSL5N0LG1ZM20140211?type=companyNews

16,"   By Caroline Copley | ZURICH  ZURICH Gene Signal is in talks with potential partners to help develop its new treatment for a leading cause of blindness in the elderly, the biotech firm's chief executive said on Tuesday.Privately-held Gene Signal is looking to muscle in on the lucrative market for treating wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) currently dominated by Roche's Lucentis and Regeneron's Eylea.Unlike Lucentis and Eylea, which must be injected into the eye, Gene Signal's aganirsen is administered topically as an eye drop or an emulsion, making it a less cumbersome and potentially more convenient treatment.Pre-clinical studies by the Lausanne-based firm have already shown the drug can travel from the front to the back of the eye - one of the main challenges for topical medicines - giving the company confidence ahead of the start of a mid-stage trial in the third quarter.Chief Executive Eric Viaud, who co-founded Gene Signal in 2000, said the company was already in discussions about possible partnerships to develop the drug in AMD. He said he would prefer a partnership over an initial public offering.   Aganirsen could be both a complementary and alternative treatment since the efficacy of injectable therapies can diminish over time, Viaud told Reuters.""We know that we have an add-on effect. It's also an alternative when you cannot use injections any more because of local infections or side effects,"" he said.But the drug faces high hurdles to challenge the dominance of Lucentis and Eylea - fast-growing drugs which racked up multi-billion dollar sales last year and have set the standard for efficacy and safety, said Helvea analyst Olav Zilian.     Gene Signal is also in a race with New York-based Ohr Pharmaceutical Inc, which is conducting mid-stage trials for its own eye drop. An interim analysis of the data is expected in the second quarter of this year. Viaud was sanguine about the competition, pointing to the growing ranks of elderly which are expected to drive demand for eye drugs. AMD affects 1.8 million Americans aged 40 or above, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Recent positive results of a late-stage trial testing aganirsen as a treatment for patients who suffer from abnormal blood vessel growth in the front of the eye, have also boosted Viaud's confidence about the drug's efficacy.Gene Signal is working on a short, final trial in this indication and expects to file for regulatory approval within the next two years.While the company has sufficient financial firepower to market aganirsen as a treatment for this smaller indication in Europe, it would need to partner with a bigger player if it is to launch the drug in the United States or as a treatment for AMD, Viaud said.

18,"  (Adds details)PARIS, June 12 French drug maker Sanofi  and its partner Regeneron on Thursday said they had obtained positive phase three results for their Sarilumab rheumatoid arthritis drug. Sarilumab is an injectable antibody that works by blocking an inflammation-causing protein called interleukin 6. It is similar to Actemra, Roche's fast-growing treatment approved in 2010. Sarilumab, alongside cholesterol drug alirocumab, is one of the products Sanofi is developing under its partnership with U.S. biotech Regeneron to offset the loss of patents on once top-selling drugs like blood thinner Plavix. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue, causing inflammation and pain in the joints.

""As the stake keeps going up it gives the perception to the Street or investors that Sanofi will eventually acquire Regeneron,"" said Roth Capital Partners analyst Joseph Pantginis.There is currently a no-acquisition clause in the long-term agreements between the two companies.""The standstill clause does protect them, but deals can always be renegotiated,"" Pantginis said. ""They already renegotiated maximum cap that Sanofi can own."" In January, Regeneron said its investor agreement with Sanofi allows the French drugmaker to take a 30 percent stake and to name a board member. It appointed Robert Ingram to Regeneron's board earlier this year.The two companies have several drug development partnerships, including on the big-selling eye drug Eylea and a potential multi-billion dollar cholesterol drug which is completing late-stage development.Sanofi and Regeneron investors were also cheered by news from Allergan Inc on Monday. Allergan provided an update on Darpin, its potential rival to Eylea, that eased concerns over any near-term competition. Allergan said it would not begin pivotal Phase III trials of the drug before the second quarter of 2015. Regeneron reported first-quarter U.S. Eylea sales of $359 million.Darpin is ""definitely a competitive threat for Eylea, but the time line seems to be quite a while for them to get it on the market,"" said Morningstar analyst Stefan Quenneville.Analysts said the Phase II data Allergan released and its Phase III plans alleviated some concerns, and that the Regeneron stock had been oversold.""The comparator they're using in Phase 3 is (Roche's Lucentis, not Eylea,"" Quenneville noted. ""For some people it's indicative that they don't have a lot of confidence that they would be able to show significant differentiation against Eylea.""Regeneron shares were up $18.93, or 6.7 percent, at $301.40 in afternoon trading on Nasdaq.

22,"   By Natalie Huet and Ransdell Pierson | PARIS/NEW YORK  PARIS/NEW YORK An experimental drug from Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc significantly reduced skin lesions and itching in adult patients with atopic dermatitis, a chronic form of eczema that is poorly controlled by standard drugs, the companies said on Wednesday.The findings were seen in a Phase IIb, or mid-stage, trial of the injectable drug dupilumab, which is also being tested by the drugmakers against two other allergic conditions: asthma and nasal polyps. Dupilumab was named ""clinical advance of the year"" in 2013 by industry publication Scrip Intelligence, and some analysts expect it to capture annual sales up to $2 billion if approved.Atopic dermatitis causes patches of dry, red and highly itchy skin on any part of the body. Patients, many of whom also have asthma and hay fever, have compared the sensation to having unending poison ivy. Currently, patients get limited relief from topical steroid creams and oral steroid medicines that are not approved in the United States for the condition.Dupilumab works through a new approach, by blocking two proteins linked to inflammation, interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13).  The 16-week Phase IIb clinical trial involved 380 adults with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis, and about half their skin was affected by the disease. All doses of dupilumab met the study's main goal, showing greater improvement of eczema symptoms compared to placebo.Improvement rates ranged from 74 percent for patients on the highest dose (300 mg weekly) to 45 percent in those with the weakest dose (100 mg monthly), as judged by a standard index that evaluates area and severity of eczema. That compared with an 18 percent improvement in patients given a placebo.“It’s really the itch associated with atopic dermatitis that can affect your quality of life, your employment and ability to function and to go to school and to sleep,” George Yancopoulos, Regeneron's research chief, said in an interview.Dupilumab, if approved, would likely be the first drug to directly target proteins that cause the disease, Yancopoulos said. In separate Phase IIa trial results published last year, dupilumab slashed asthma episodes by 87 percent, making it a potential game changer for patients with moderate to severe disease. The most common side effects of the drug include nasopharyngitis (common cold) and headache.Sanofi and Regeneron expect to begin late-stage trials of dupilumab in atopic dermatitis later this year. The New England Journal of Medicine on Wednesday published favorable data from earlier studies of dupilumab in atopic dermatitis.Dr. Lisa Beck, a professor of dermatology at Rochester Medical Center who helped conduct those trials, said about 3.4 million U.S. adults have moderate to severe atopic dermatitis.""We will get a surge of eczema patients seeking treatment with this drug"" if it is approved, she predicted.

26,"   By Ransdell Pierson and Natalie Huet | NEW YORK/PARIS  NEW YORK/PARIS A new drug being developed by Sanofi SA and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc significantly cut cholesterol in nine late-stage clinical trials, the companies said on Wednesday, and provided the first glimpse of its potential to prevent heart attacks and strokes. The injectable drug, alirocumab, is from a new class of medicines called PCSK9 inhibitors, which are also being developed by Amgen Inc and Pfizer Inc. If approved, they could lower ""bad"" LDL cholesterol in a new way and reap multibillion-dollar sales.An interim safety analysis of one of the Phase III studies showed patients on alirocumab were less prone, versus those on placebo, to a combination of cardiovascular events, including cardiac death, heart attack, stroke, and chest pain requiring hospitalization. That ongoing 2,341-patient study, called Odyssey Long Term, is expected to conclude early next year. Data were examined when all patients had been in the trial for a year, and about 25 percent had reached 18 months of treatment.No other drugmaker has released data suggesting reduced cardiovascular risk from PCSK9 inhibitors.But Regeneron Chief Executive Leonard Schleifer, in an interview, played down the favorable cardiovascular data. He said the trial was not designed to show reduced cardiovascular risk, but to assess safety and effectiveness in lowering LDL.  ""One should not draw any conclusions from this,"" Schleifer said, adding that the definitive word on alirocumab's potential to cut heart risk will come from an ongoing 18,000-patient study called Odyssey Outcomes.    Schleifer said, however, the favorable cardiovascular data  offers encouragement that Sanofi and Regeneron are testing ""the right hypothesis"".PCSK9 inhibitors cut cholesterol by blocking a protein that prevents the body from eliminating LDL from the bloodstream.In earlier mid-stage studies, alirocumab and Amgen's own anti-PCSK9 drug, when combined with statins, cut LDL by almost 70 percent beyond reductions seen with statins alone.    Data from the nine large Odyssey trials showed that after 24 weeks, LDL reductions with alirocumab were consistent with results seen in previous trials. The trials involve patients whose high LDL cholesterol levels are not sufficiently controlled by statins and other existing treatments, and patients who cannot tolerate statins or who have a high cardiovascular risk.In eight of the studies, all patients received alirocumab in addition to standard treatments such as statins and Merck & Co's Zetia.  Sanofi and Regeneron plan to seek approvals for alirocumab by year-end. The companies said they would seek a priority review from U.S. regulators that would allow for an approval decision in six months rather than the usual 10 months.  The most common side effects of alirocumab in the trials included stuffy nose and upper respiratory tract infections.Regeneron is best known for its hot-selling Eylea treatment for macular degeneration. Late on Tuesday, it said U.S. regulators had approved Eylea to treat diabetic macular edema. Regeneron shares closed up 5.8 percent at $322.18 on Nasdaq, while Sanofi shares were little changed.

The companies said they would seek a priority review from U.S. regulators that would allow for an approval decision in six months rather than the usual 10 months.The most common side effects of alirocumab in the trials included stuffy nose and upper respiratory tract infections.Regeneron is best known for its hot-selling Eylea treatment for macular degeneration. Late on Tuesday, it said U.S. regulators had approved Eylea to treat diabetic macular edema.Regeneron shares closed up 5.8 percent at $322.18 on Nasdaq, while Sanofi shares were little changed.

Gross domestic product grew at a 4 percent annual rate in the second quarter, above the 3 percent rate that had been expected and a sharp reversal from the weather-impacted first quarter, when the economy contracted a revised 2.1 percent.Twitter Inc surged on heavy volume, jumping 25 percent to $48.25 in its biggest one-day advance ever after reporting that monthly active users had risen a better-than-expected 24 percent in the second quarter. The social networking company also gave a revenue forecast above forecasts.""It all looks good today. Earnings have been decent and the GDP number surprised everybody for sure. In this rate environment, the market isn't expensive and we're still finding good values,"" said Gary Bradshaw, portfolio manager at Hodges Capital Management in Dallas.Market participants shrugged off the ADP National Employment Report, which showed companies hired 218,000 workers in July, a level that was below analysts' projections and was also down from June. The results bolstered support for Internet and other social media stocks, assuaging concerns the group is overpriced. Facebook Inc, which also posted strong results this quarter, rose 1 percent to $74.48. LinkedIn Corp rose 2.4 percent to $185.The Dow Jones industrial average rose 51.8 points or 0.31 percent, to 16,963.91, the S&P 500 gained 8.01 points or 0.41 percent, to 1,977.96 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 32.75 points or 0.74 percent, to 4,475.45.The Nasdaq was boosted by biotechnology stocks for a second straight day. The Nasdaq biotech index was up 1.8 percent after Amgen Inc posted better-than-expected earnings and raised its outlook, sending shares up 6 percent to $130.67. Also lifting biotechs was Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc , up 9.8 percent to $334.46, after reporting positive results from a Phase III trial.Among other results, American Express Co late Tuesday reported adjusted earnings in line with expectations, while WellPoint Inc beat expectations.Shares of AmEx, a Dow component, fell 0.3 percent to $91.41 while WellPoint fell 2.7 percent to $109.55.While this earnings season has been positive in aggregate, with more companies than usual beating expectations for both earnings and revenue, there have been some high-profile disappointments from UPS and Amazon.com Inc.Later on Wednesday, the Federal Open Market Committee will release a statement as it concludes its latest policy meeting.The central bank is widely expected to trim monthly asset purchases to $25 billion from $35 billion, which would leave it on course to shutter the program this fall. Investors are looking for any hint on whether officials are growing more anxious to start to reverse their monetary accommodation.

29,"  * Sanofi to file drug for US and EU approval by year-end* Nine Phase III ODYSSEY trials meet primary endpoint* Alirocumab ""generally well tolerated"" in trialsBy Natalie HuetPARIS, July 30 A new drug being developed by French drugmaker Sanofi and U.S. partner Regeneron  cut ""bad"" LDL cholesterol more than placebo and existing treatments in nine late-stage clinical trials, the companies said on Wednesday.The injectable drug, called alirocumab, is from a promising new class of medicines, called PCSK9 inhibitors, also being developed by Amgen Inc and other drugmakers. If approved, these drugs could reap annual sales of $3 billion or more, according to some industry analysts. The Phase III ODYSSEY trials showed that after 24 weeks, the mean percentage reduction in LDL cholesterol with alirocumab was consistent with results seen in previous trials, the companies said in a statement.The trials involved patients whose high LDL cholesterol levels are not sufficiently controlled by existing treatments such as statins, who cannot tolerate these or who present a high or very high cardiovascular risk.""The robust data from these studies in more than 5,000 patients is the basis of our global regulatory submissions, which we expect in the U.S. and EU by year-end,"" said Sanofi R&D chief Elias Zerhouni. PCSK9 inhibitors block a protein that prevents the body from eliminating LDL cholesterol from the bloodstream and offer a new way of fighting the build-up of artery-clogging fat that puts patients at risk of heart attacks.These drugs are mainly aimed at the millions of people who either cannot tolerate statins such as Pfizer Inc's  Lipitor or AstraZeneca Plc's Crestor or who cannot get their cholesterol levels under control with statins alone. In earlier mid-stage studies, when combined with statins, alirocumab and Amgen's own PCSK9 drug cut levels of LDL cholesterol by close to 70 percent, more than statins alone.The drug was ""generally well tolerated"" in the trials, with most common adverse events being nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infections and injection site reactions.Serious adverse events and deaths were ""generally balanced"" between treatment groups as were musculoskeletal, neurocognitive and liver-related events, the companies added.An interim safety analysis showed that after 18 months of treatment, patients on alirocumab were less prone to cardiovascular events (cardiac death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and unstable angina requiring hospitalization) compared with those on placebo.Alirocumab's potential to cut cardiovascular risk is being assessed in an ongoing 18,000-patient long-term outcomes trial.

Eylea's U.S. sales rose 26 percent to $415 million, above Wall Street expectations of $410 million. But Regeneron, which often raises its U.S. Eylea sales forecasts, stuck to its view of $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion for the full year. “It was a solid quarter for Eylea, but you can’t raise sales guidance every quarter,” said Morningstar analyst Stefan Quenneville. Some investors may have been disappointed that Regeneron had not nudged its 2014 view higher, Quenneville said. Although shares fell in premarket trading, they recovered and were up almost 3 percent by mid-morning. Eylea gained momentum from disappointing 14 percent U.S. sales growth in the prior quarter that was due largely to a drop in distributor inventory, said Robert Baird analyst Christopher Raymond.""We wondered if weakness in ophthalmology office visits could have spilled over into (Regeneron's) second quarter results, but no signs of that,"" Raymond said.Bayer AG (BAYGn.DE), which sells Eylea outside the United States, reported a more than doubling of sales in those markets to $247 million.

34,"   By Ben Hirschler | BARCELONA  BARCELONA An experimental cholesterol-lowering drug from Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals roughly halved the number of heart attacks and strokes in a clinical trial, researchers reported on Sunday.The result is not conclusive, because the analysis was done retrospectively, but it provides the first evidence that targeting a protein known as PCSK9 could slash cardiovascular risks for millions of patients.The injectable drug, alirocumab, is from a new class of medicines, which are also being developed by Amgen and Pfizer. They lower ""bad"" LDL cholesterol in a new way and are widely expected to reap multibillion-dollar sales.The finding is likely to spur enthusiasm about the drugs, which could reach the market next year, although experts said it still needed to be confirmed in a much larger trial.Sanofi and Regeneron said in July that nine big studies showed consistent LDL reductions with alirocumab, but details from four of these trials have only now been unveiled at the European Society of Cardiology annual meeting in Barcelona.The encouraging cardiovascular data come from an interim safety analysis of one of these studies showing patients on alirocumab were less prone to a combination of cardiovascular events, including cardiac death, heart attack, stroke and chest pain requiring hospitalization.Both groups of patients got traditional anti-cholesterol statin pills in addition to alirocumab or a placebo. Among the alirocumab group, 1.4 percent of patients suffered a major cardiovascular event against 3.0 percent of those on placebo.The ongoing 2,341-patient study, called Odyssey Long Term, is expected to conclude early next year but researchers said the early sign of efficacy was clearly positive.“To have this result emerge so quickly in this study is very encouraging,"" said Jennifer Robinson, a cardiologist at the University of Iowa, who led the study. No other drugmaker has previously released data suggesting reduced cardiovascular risk from PCSK9 inhibitors.Patrick O'Gara of the Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston and president of the American College of Cardiology said the finding was ""biologically plausible"" but the post-hoc or retrospective nature of the analysis necessitated caution.“It’s so much wished-for that we must be careful,"" he said.WATCHING SIDE EFFECTS  Sanofi and Regeneron are in a fierce race with Amgen, which last week became the first company to file with regulators to sell its product evolocumab.The French and U.S. partners hope to close the gap after paying $67.5 million last month for a voucher from BioMarin Pharmaceutical designed to assure alirocumab an expedited U.S. regulatory review. It is unclear if the rival PCSK9 drugs will prove to be very different from each other but Sanofi's research head Elias Zerhouni thinks alirocumab should enjoy an early advantage from the preliminary indication of improved cardiovascular results.That may help convince cost-conscious healthcare providers to pay up for an expensive new medicine before results from the large 18,000-patient trial are available in 2017 or 2018.“It has to be confirmed by the big outcomes study but it is the first scientific indication that there is something other than a statin that potentially shows you can get a reduction in risk,” Zerhouni told Reuters. All four trials presented in Barcelona showed alirocumab cut LDL by around 50-60 percent after 24 weeks. Side effects included stuffy nose and upper respiratory tract infections.Doctors and regulatory authorities are watching closely to see if cutting LDL so sharply may have an adverse effect on other parts of the body, notably the brain.So far, there is no sign of this. There was a small non-statistically significant trend towards more neurocognitive problems in Odyssey Long Term but the other three studies showed alirocumab patients had fewer such issues.PCSK9 drugs will be targeted first at people with a rare familial condition that raises their cholesterol dangerously, as well as statin-intolerant patients and those at high-risk of a heart attack who struggle to control LDL on current medicines.Sanofi and Regeneron estimate this high-risk group totals around 21 million patients in the United States and Europe.Whether the drugs, which will be offered in pre-filled syringes and auto-injector pens, will be used more generally depends on how their cost-effective they are deemed to be.The companies say it is premature to talk about price but it is clear the antibody-based therapies will not be cheap, with Barclays analysts suggesting $6,000 a year as a possible price in the United States, with a lower price likely in Europe.

That rose to 51 percent versus 6 when excluding those who didn't complete 24 weeks of treatment. Target goals were for LDL under 70 for very high-risk patients and under 100 for high-risk patients.  ""It's a more potent and more effective lipid lowering drug, getting patients to goal by a 10-fold higher amount. It just blows (Zetia) away,"" said Dr. Patrick Moriarty, the study's lead investigator, who presented the results at the American Heart Association scientific meeting in Chicago.Zetia is used to lower LDL in patients who cannot take highly effective statins, such as Pfizer's Lipitor.

57,"  (Adds Amgen, Regeneron comments)By Susan Kelly and Bill BerkrotJan 13 Express Scripts, the largest U.S. pharmacy benefit manager, on Tuesday said cost savings on expensive cancer treatments could be achieved if the company were involved earlier in the decision-making process.Express Scripts, which has become more aggressive in negotiating discounts on drugs for insurance plans and employers, in December stopped covering Gilead Sciences Inc's  hepatitis C treatments after lining up a cheaper price for AbbVie's newly-approved alternative.Gilead's Sovaldi and follow-up combination pill Harvoni have been shown to cure hepatitis C in more than 90 percent of patients. But Express deemed the more than $90,000 price for 12 weeks of Harvoni treatment unaffordable. The move reignited investor concerns that drugmakers will have to bow to pricing pressure from U.S. insurers and lawmakers over novel medications whose cost can reach hundreds of thousands of dollars for some diseases.For cancer patients, treatment decisions typically go through health insurance plans first, and medicines are not changed once people have begun their regimens, Express Scripts Chief Executive George Paz said at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare conference in San Francisco. He said PBMs should be included in the decision-making process at a much earlier stage.""The big opportunity out there is really in cancer,"" Paz said. ""If we can get out in front of that, that is a huge opportunity."" Paz said he is also focused on a new crop of cholesterol-lowering drugs expected to hit the market this year, and is talking to companies about market share, positioning and pricing.""They are pretty astonishing, but they are also very expensive,"" Paz said of the drugs which target a protein known as PCSK9. Manufacturers include Amgen Inc and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc in partnership with Sanofi . The key is to determine which are real breakthrough treatments and which are ""me too"" drugs, Paz said. Amgen said it was talking to payers about its evolocumab, and believes they can only exclude a drug from formularies if there is no clinical difference between rival medicines.""If not, payers will have to leave choices to physicians,"" said Tony Hooper, Amgen's head of commercial operations.Regeneron Chief Executive Officer Len Schleifer was asked if he was concerned about Paz's comments that PCSK9 drugs were in his sights.""It's not a worry. It's a reality that we will deal with,"" Schleifer said. ""I think there will be fair pricing and healthy competition in the marketplace.""

58,"   By Bill Berkrot  Regeneron Pharmaceuticals on Monday said U.S. health regulators accepted its application to review a potent  cholesterol drug on a priority basis, potentially giving it the upper hand in a fierce race with Amgen to bring a new medicine from the promising class to market.Regeneron, which is developing the drug, alirocumab, in partnership with Sanofi, said the target date for a Food and Drug Administration approval decision was July 24, following a six-month review period.That could put the medicine on the U.S. market a month ahead of Amgen's rival evolocumab. Amgen was first to file its application, but received a standard 10-month review from the FDA, giving it an action date of Aug 27.Regeneron and Sanofi, which were seen as lagging Amgen, employed an unusual strategy to catch up, purchasing a special priority review voucher from BioMarin Pharmaceutical for $67.5 million. The drugs belong to a highly promising new class called PCSK9 inhibitors that block a protein that prevents the liver from removing bad LDL cholesterol from the blood. In clinical trials, they have shown an ability to lower LDL levels by more than 50 percent.The injectable biotech medicines are expected to be used in high-risk heart patients who are unable to tolerate statins, such as Pfizer's Lipitor, or those who cannot get LDL levels low enough with statins. They are expected to be expensive, with analysts forecasting annual sales of $3 billion for each of the drugs. Pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts Holding said it was looking at the class with an eye toward negotiating a lower price from one company in exchange for priority status on its formulary for its millions of customers. Express used the strategy with new hepatitis C treatments, getting a lower price from AbbVie and excluding Gilead's drugs.The first company to bring a PCSK9 drug to market would not only have a period to launch the medicine without competition, but would set the price for the class. Pfizer is also working on a PCSK9 drug that will likely be third to market. Regeneron and Sanofi submitted an application for European approval of alirocumab earlier this month.

64,"  (Adds comment from conference call, share movement)May 7 Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc  said it expects sales of blockbuster eye drug Eylea to grow even more quickly following data that showed it was superior to rival treatments.The company said it now expected net sales of its flagship drug to be 30-35 percent higher this year than in 2014, when Eylea raked in global sales of $2.78 billion.In February, the company forecast sales growth of 25-30 percent.Sales of Eylea in the United States leapt 51 percent to $541 million in the first quarter ended March 31, helping the company's adjusted profit handsomely beat the average analyst estimate.Eylea has charmed investors since it was first approved in late 2011 to treat wet age-related macular degeneration, a leading cause of blindness in the elderly. Regeneron's shares have risen nearly eight-fold since the drug's launch, while revenue has soared to more than $2.8 billion from about $446 million.The stock climbed as much as 3 percent to $482.99 on the Nasdaq on Thursday, before paring those gains to trade slightly down.Data from a government-sponsored study, called ""Protocol-T"",  published in February demonstrated that Eylea was better than Roche Holding AG's rival drugs, Avastin and Lucentis, particularly in patients with severe vision loss. Much of Eylea's growth appears to be related to the reaction among physicians to the protocol-T data, said Robert Terifay, Regeneron's senior vice president, commercial.""According to our qualitative survey, the market share for Eylea now surpasses Lucentis in the United States,"" Terifay said on a post-earnings call. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration in March expanded the use of Eylea to treat diabetic retinopathy, the most common diabetic eye disease and a leading cause of blindness in adults.Eylea has also been cleared to fight macular edema, and a related sight-robbing condition called diabetic macular edema.Even as Eylea sales continue unabated, investors are turning their focus to the company's next potential blockbuster Praluent, which is aimed at millions who cannot tolerate or realize enough benefit from widely-used statins.The companies are in a fierce race with Amgen Inc, which is also looking to market a similar drug.Regeneron anticipates an initial ""gradual"" uptake of Praluent, executives said on the call, citing a ""complex and carefully managed"" reimbursement environment.

66,"  Amgen Inc's closely watched new cholesterol drug, Repatha, has been recommended for approval in Europe, putting the U.S. drugmaker ahead in a race with rival Sanofi SA.Repatha, or evolocumab, belongs to a new class of cholesterol-lowering drugs known as PCSK9 inhibitors that have the potential to drastically reduce the risk of heart attacks when used in addition to standard treatment.France's Sanofi and its partner, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc, are developing a rival drug called Praluent, and both treatments have been running neck-and-neck in the sprint to market.Neither has won approval in the all-important U.S. market yet.The European Medicines Agency, on Friday, recommended approval for Repatha to be used in adult patients with hypercholesterolaemia or mixed dyslipidaemia and adults and adolescents aged 12 years and over with homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia. (bit.ly/1FrWu5K)Recommendations for marketing approval by its Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) are normally endorsed by the European Commission within a couple of months. Numerous trials have shown that PCSK9 inhibitors significantly lower blood levels of ""bad"" LDL cholesterol, but widespread use will hinge on whether the drugs are proven to prevent heart attacks, other serious heart problems.The experimental drugs are antibodies designed to target the PCSK9 protein that maintains LDL cholesterol in the bloodstream. They work differently from statins, which block the liver's production of LDL cholesterol in the first place. Both Amgen and Sanofi have filed for approval of their drugs based on trials showing that they lower LDL in patients whose cholesterol is not controlled by other drugs, those who cannot tolerate other drugs and people genetically predisposed to high cholesterol.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is slated to decide on Amgen's application for Repatha by Aug. 27, while the deadline for Praluent, also known as alirocumab, is July 24.Neither Amgen nor Sanofi expect definitive data on cardiovascular outcomes for their drugs until larger trials conclude in 2017. Pfizer Inc, which has not yet filed for approval of its PCSK9 drug, expects outcomes data in a similar time frame.

The panel was the first in years to discuss the use of LDL as a surrogate measure of a drug's ability to reduce heart attacks and other cardiovascular problems.Panelists agreed LDL-lowering remains an appropriate surrogate for cardiovascular benefit for statins but were not as convinced that it is appropriate for other classes of cholesterol-lowering drugs.Sanofi expects to complete enrollment in an 18,000-patient cardiovascular outcomes trial by the end of the year.

72,"   By Toni Clarke | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved a potent new cholesterol-lowering drug from Sanofi SA (SASY.PA) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc (REGN.O) on Friday but limited its approved use to patients with a hereditary form of the condition and those with cardiovascular disease.The FDA ruling came just hours after European regulators recommended approval for broader use of the drug, called Praluent, in all patients with high cholesterol who are not able to lower it even by taking maximal doses of statin therapy. The companies expect the drug to receive formal approval by the European Commission in late September. The commission recently approved a rival drug, Repatha, made by Amgen Inc (AMGN.O).The FDA approved Praluent for patients with clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, including those who have had heart attacks or strokes. It also approved the drug for heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH), the most common hereditary form of high cholesterol.Regeneron said between 8 and 10 million people fall into those categories.Investors had hoped the FDA would also approve the drug for patients with non-hereditary high cholesterol who cannot tolerate, or do not respond to, statins such as Pfizer Inc's (PFE.N) Lipitor. Statins are widely available in cheaper generic form.""Investors are citing the lack of inclusion of primary prevention as more narrow than expected,"" said Mark Schoenebaum, an analyst at Evercore ISI.

79,"   By Ben Hirschler | LONDON  LONDON Two of the most anticipated new heart drugs to be launched in recent years have been priced well above analyst expectations, fuelling the debate about whether modern medicines cost too much.Praluent, made by Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, and Entresto from Novartis are both treatments that represent significant advances for millions of patients at risk of serious heart problems.But their positioning in the marketplace was always likely to be contentious since they offer more effective alternatives to very cheap, off-patent drugs.The manufacturers have taken an ambitious view on pricing, arguing that the clear medical benefits of their products and their ability to keep patients out of expensive hospital beds, make them cost-effective choices for healthcare providers.The high prices have also prompted rising sales forecasts, but they may provoke clashes with the providers. Sanofi and Regeneron, which won U.S. approval on Friday for Praluent to treat stubbornly high cholesterol, said the injection would cost $14,600 a year, well above the roughly $10,000 investors had expected. Tim Race of Deutsche Bank said the high official price would allow the companies to offer generous rebates in what is expected to be a competitive market, resulting in a net price that could be discounted by 30-50 percent over time.Sanofi and Regeneron are competing against Amgen's Repatha, another so-called PCSK9 inhibitor, which is still awaiting a green light in the United States, although it was approved last week in Europe.Still, setting a high price is a gamble as it could drive healthcare providers to put restrictions on Praluent's use, according to Joseph Schwartz of Leerink, who had been modeling a below-consensus price of about just $5,000. On July 7, Novartis set a price of $4,560 a year for its new heart failure pill Entresto, nearly 50 percent higher than many analysts had expected.Novartis does not face direct competition to Entresto but the company has said it will offer discount deals, including basing the amount paid on patients' clinical outcomes.Big U.S. pharmacy benefit managers such as Express Scripts and CVS Health, who negotiate drug prices for health plan members, have already warned that the cost of new heart drugs - particularly PCSK9s - will strain budgets. Leading heart doctors, while welcoming the arrival of novel weapons to keep heart troubles at bay, have also cited price as a potential problem.The new heart drugs cost nowhere near as much as many modern cancer drugs, often priced at more than $100,000, but their impact on budgets will be considerable since they are designed for lifetime use.Praluent and Amgen's Repatha are expected to generate global annual sales of more than $2 billion each by 2020, according to consensus forecasts compiled by Thomson Reuters Cortellis.Entresto is forecast to sell nearly $5 billion by the same date, a figure that has been climbing since the price was set.

87,"   By Julie Steenhuysen | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Scientists at U.S. biotechnology company Regeneron Pharmaceuticals researching a rare genetic disease that traps sufferers in a second skeleton have discovered a treatment that shuts down excessive bone growth in mice engineered to develop the illness.Company scientists said on Wednesday the protein Activin-A, which normally blocks bone growth, triggers hyperactive bone growth in patients with a genetic mutation that causes the disease. The disease is known as Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva, or FOP. The researchers showed that an antibody that blocks Activin-A helped shut down the growth signal in genetically modified mice. The effect lasted as long as six weeks, according to the study, published in the journal Science Translational Medicine. Aris Economides, executive director of skeletal diseases and co-founder of the Regeneron Genetics Center, said the findings could eventually lead to a treatment for the disease. FOP is a lethal genetic disorder in which muscle and soft tissue gradually are replaced by bone, forming an extra skeleton that immobilizes and eventually suffocates patients.The condition currently affects 800 people globally, including 200 in the United States. FOP is caused by mutations in the gene ACVR1 which makes a receptor that controls bone growth in cells. Regeneron discovered that this mutated receptor has an abnormal response in the presence of Activin-A, a growth factor often secreted by the immune system in response to injury and inflammation. Normally, Activin-A blocks the receptor, putting the brakes on bone growth. In individuals with the FOP mutation, Activin-A has the opposite effect. ""It's as if the brakes are hot-wired to the gas pedal,"" Economides told Reuters.The finding explains how abnormal bone forms in FOP patients, often in response to injuries or illness that cause tissue swelling or inflammation, he said.To test their finding, researchers developed a therapeutic antibody designed to block Activin-A. When injected in mice that developed a form of the disease, the drug blocked the formation of excess bone. Economides said the antibody works in a similar way to Regeneron and Sanofi's newly approved antibody drug Praluent, a cholesterol-lowering drug which blocks a receptor called PSCK9 on liver cells that controls the removal of ""bad"" LDL cholesterol.Betsy Bogard, director of global research development for the International FOP Association and the sister of an FOP patient, called Regeneron's findings ""incredibly exciting,"" as  they help explain some of science behind FOP and also raise hope for a new treatment approach.But Bogard, who is a former executive of the drug company Genzyme, a unit of Sanofi, remained cautious.  ""The road of developing drugs is long and difficult.

88,"   By Julie Steenhuysen | CHICAGO, Sept 2  CHICAGO, Sept 2 Scientists at U.S. biotechnology company Regeneron Pharmaceuticals researching a rare genetic disease that traps sufferers in a second skeleton have discovered a treatment that shuts down excessive bone growth in mice engineered to develop the illness.Company scientists said on Wednesday the protein Activin-A, which normally blocks bone growth, triggers hyperactive bone growth in patients with a genetic mutation that causes the disease. The disease is known as Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva, or FOP.The researchers showed that an antibody that blocks Activin-A helped shut down the growth signal in genetically modified mice. The effect lasted as long as six weeks, according to the study, published in the journal Science Translational Medicine.Aris Economides, executive director of skeletal diseases and co-founder of the Regeneron Genetics Center, said the findings could eventually lead to a treatment for the disease. FOP is a lethal genetic disorder in which muscle and soft tissue gradually are replaced by bone, forming an extra skeleton that immobilizes and eventually suffocates patients.The condition currently affects 800 people globally, including 200 in the United States. FOP is caused by mutations in the gene ACVR1 which makes a receptor that controls bone growth in cells. Regeneron discovered that this mutated receptor has an abnormal response in the presence of Activin-A, a growth factor often secreted by the immune system in response to injury and inflammation.Normally, Activin-A blocks the receptor, putting the brakes on bone growth. In individuals with the FOP mutation, Activin-A has the opposite effect. ""It's as if the brakes are hot-wired to the gas pedal,"" Economides told Reuters.The finding explains how abnormal bone forms in FOP patients, often in response to injuries or illness that cause tissue swelling or inflammation, he said. To test their finding, researchers developed a therapeutic antibody designed to block Activin-A. When injected in mice that developed a form of the disease, the drug blocked the formation of excess bone.Economides said the antibody works in a similar way to Regeneron and Sanofi's newly approved antibody drug Praluent, a cholesterol-lowering drug which blocks a receptor called PSCK9 on liver cells that controls the removal of ""bad"" LDL cholesterol.Betsy Bogard, director of global research development for the International FOP Association and the sister of an FOP patient, called Regeneron's findings ""incredibly exciting,"" as  they help explain some of science behind FOP and also raise hope for a new treatment approach. But Bogard, who is a former executive of the drug company Genzyme, a unit of Sanofi, remained cautious.""The road of developing drugs is long and difficult. There is still much to learn,"" she said.Although the company would not disclose details or timing of its development approach, Regeneron spokeswoman Alexandra Bowie said preclinical testing is ongoing, and the company hopes to move the treatment into human trials.Clementia Pharmaceuticals Inc, a private Montreal-based company, is also studying FOP and is testing a compound called palovarotene.

89,"  (Adds Regeneron comment, approval details)By Bill BerkrotSept 8 An independent non-profit organization that evaluates clinical and cost effectiveness of new medicines said announced prices for a just-approved class of potent cholesterol lowering drugs were far too high, according to a draft report released on Tuesday.The Boston-based Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) said its analyses indicated ""that the price that best represents the overall benefits"" the drugs may provide patients would be between $3,615 and $4,811 a year, a 67 percent discount off the list prices.""Even if these drugs were used in just over 25 percent of eligible patients, then employers, insurers, and patients would need to spend on average more than $20 billion a year for these drugs,"" ICER president Steven Pearson said in a statement.It would take a further price reduction to an annual cost of $2,177 in order to not have to try to limit patient use to keep overall health care cost growth within bounds, ICER concluded. The new injectable cholesterol fighters belong to a class known as PCSK9 inhibitors that in clinical trials lowered levels of ""bad"" LDL cholesterol by about 55-60 percent in patients who could not reduce their levels enough with inexpensive, widely-used statins, such as Lipitor, or those who could not tolerate statins. Ongoing studies will determine if they actually cut heart attacks as statins have been shown to do.Praluent from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Sanofi  has a U.S. price of $14,600 for a year of treatment. Amgen Inc set an annual price of $14,100 for its Repatha. Depending on how they are used in practice, it has been estimated that between 3.5 million and 15 million Americans could be eligible for treatment, ICER said.""There are serious questions regarding the price at which these drugs would represent a sensible value to patients and to the health care system,"" the report said. ICER found that the two drugs appear to have equivalent overall effectiveness for most patient groups.The drugs were initially approved for use in patients with a hereditary form of extreme high cholesterol and those with heart disease. Amgen said it disagrees with ICER's methodology, assumptions and preliminary conclusions. ""We are concerned that ... its short term budgetary focus will be used to create access barriers to innovative medicines like Repatha for appropriate patients,"" Amgen spokeswoman Kristen Neese said in an emailed statement.Regeneron said it needs to better understand the methodology used in the ICER analysis and called for a robust peer review process. ""We are committed to providing affordable medicines and ensuring access to Praluent for patients who are prescribed the therapy,"" Regeneron spokeswoman Hala Mizra said.The PCSK9 drugs have been in the crosshairs of U.S. pharmacy benefit managers, such as Express Scripts and CVS Health. They hope to gain significant discounts for customers by offering the drugmakers preferential usage status in exchange for lower prices, as they have done with expensive new hepatitis C treatments.Further entry of PCSK9 drugs from Pfizer and others could also lead to lower prices as competition intensifies.

92,"   By Ransdell Pierson  Oct 12 The odds that Merck & Co's  high-stakes cholesterol drug will succeed have dropped dramatically after Eli Lilly and Co said its similar medicine failed to reduce heart attacks and strokes, top U.S. heart doctors said.Lilly on Monday said it was halting a 12,000-patient study of its drug, evacetrapib, an oral medication. In earlier studies, the treatment cut ""bad"" LDL cholesterol by 30 to 35 percent and doubled the levels of ""good"" LDL cholesterol. But the influence on cholesterol levels did not ultimately improve patients' health, dashing hopes for this approach to treating heart disease.Merck's anacetrapib is now the only drug in a novel class known as CETP inhibitors that remains in late-stage trials. Data from a 30,000-patient study is expected by 2017 to show whether it reduces the incidence of heart attack and strokes. Wall Street analysts have estimated the drug could reap eventual annual sales of up to $10 billion, if approved.But with the outlook dimmed for CETP inhibitors, Wall Street analysts on Monday predicted a boost to a competing class of drugs just approved for the U.S. market that work by sharply lowering LDL cholesterol. Shares in Amgen Inc and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals rose on expectations the Lilly decision removed a competitive threat to sales of their injectable drugs, which block a protein called PCSK9.""CETP inhibitors as legitimate drug targets are dead as of today,"" said Dr. P.K. Shah, director of atherosclerosis research at Cedars-Sinai Heart Center in Los Angeles, referring to Lilly's setback. ""For cardiologists looking for heart protection, these drugs were a dream, but they haven't come true."" Dr. Steve Nissen, head of cardiology for the Cleveland Clinic, noted that Lilly's failure follows the demise of two other high-profile drugs in the same class. Pfizer's Inc's  torcetrapib was discontinued in 2006 due to safety worries, while Roche Holding AG's dalcetrapib was terminated in 2012 for lack of benefit.""In baseball you don't get four strikes,"" he said of prospects for Merck's candidate. Nissen was chairman of the halted Lilly study, which involved trials at 540 sites in 37 countries.Merck, in an emailed statement, said it looks forward to better understanding Lilly's decision to pull the plug on evacetrapib, but remains confident in its own drug's potential success. CETP inhibitors block a protein that transfers HDL cholesterol to LDL cholesterol, resulting in higher levels of HDL and lower LDL levels. Statins, by contrast, work by reducing the liver's production of cholesterol.Amgen and Regeneron's treatments work by blocking a protein named PSCK9 whose normal function in the body is to maximize the presence of LDL cholesterol that enters the bloodstream. However, investors are still waiting for proof that PCSK9 inhibitors actually reduce heart attacks and strokes, and don't just reduce cholesterol. Data from such an ""outcomes"" trial for Regeneron's Praluent are expected by late 2016, while those from Repatha's trial are due in 2017.Dr. Allen Taylor, chief of cardiology at MedStar Heart and Vascular Institute in Washington, D.C., said it would be unwise to assume the PCSK9 inhibitors are heart-protective just because they slash LDL levels.""Until you see the trial results, all bets are off,"" he said.Should Merck's own outcomes data for anacetrapib prove positive, the pill could be a much preferred method for patients over the injections required for PCSK9 treatments.Lilly shares closed down 7.8 percent on Monday. Merck slipped 0.5 percent. Regeneron shares jumped 4.5 percent, while its PCSK9 partner, Sanofi SA, rose 1.3 percent in Paris. Amgen shares rose 2.4 percent.

An average of roughly 70 percent improvement in rash area and eczema severity was seen among patients taking the drug in both trials, about twice the improvement seen among those receiving placebo.The rate of serious side effects, including infections, was less for dupilumab than for placebos.

108,"   By Ben Hirschler | CAMBRIDGE, England  CAMBRIDGE, England AstraZeneca, working with genome pioneer Craig Venter, is launching a massive gene hunt in the most comprehensive bet yet by a pharmaceutical firm on the potential of genetic variations to unlock routes to new medicines.    The initiative, announced on Friday, involves sequencing up to 2 million human genomes - the complete set of genetic code that acts as the software of life - including 500,000 DNA samples collected by AstraZeneca in global clinical trials.    Financial details of the 10-year project were not disclosed but Mene Pangalos, head of early drug development, said the company would be investing ""hundreds of millions of dollars"".AstraZeneca aims to identify rare genetic mutations involved in every kind of disease by scanning DNA from volunteers who agreed to have their genomes sequenced and to provide access to detailed medical records.    The project is made possible by a dramatic fall in the cost of genetic sequencing. It took government-funded scientists $3 billion and 13 years to sequence the first human genome by 2003. Today, it costs around $1,000 and takes just three days.    AstraZeneca will work with Venter's U.S. company Human Longevity Inc (HLI), which will sequence the genomes, including 1 million from HLI's database, and use machine-learning software to find patterns in genetic variations.     The British group, which is establishing an in-house Centre for Genomics Research in Cambridge, where it is relocating its global headquarters, has also partnered with the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute and Finland's Institute for Molecular Medicine.     AstraZeneca is not the first drugmaker to start amassing troves of human DNA in this way but Venter, one of the first scientists to sequence the human genome, said it was the biggest commitment to date by any pharmaceutical company.    Regeneron Pharmaceuticals signed a deal with Pennsylvania's Geisinger Health System two years ago to sequence partial genomes of some 250,000 volunteers, while Roche's Genentech unit signed a deal last year for HLI to sequence tens of thousands of genomes.     ""The big thing here is the magnitude of what we are trying to do,"" Pangalos said. ""This takes it to a completely different level and I think it is going to be relevant of every therapeutic area.""Until now, the field of genomics has largely failed to live up to the hype of hoped-for medical breakthroughs, although more recently genetic understanding has been crucial in the development of some cancer treatments.    Now, thanks to industrial-scale sequencing and advances in gene editing that allow scientists to quickly test the effects of genetic variations, progress is expected to accelerate. Venter believes it could also unleash a new era of forensics, with HLI trying to predict what people might look like from their DNA.     AstraZeneca’s decision to embed genomics across its research and development follows a push last year by the company to expand gene testing into areas including heart disease and asthma.     “I believe we really have finally turned the corner and genomics will become central in drug development efforts,” said David Goldstein, a genetics expert from Columbia University, who chairs AstraZeneca’s Genomics Advisory Board.

110,"   By Amrutha Penumudi  Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc, facing slowing sales of blockbuster eye drug Eylea, said it was making substantial progress in securing more insurance coverage for cholesterol drug Praluent, its other key product.Shares of the company, which reported better-than-expected first-quarter revenue, rose as much 5.8 percent on Thursday.Praluent, which is co-owned by Sanofi SA, has often been touted as the company's next blockbuster but the cholesterol-lowering drug has been slow to take off in the market with insurers resisting its high cost.Regeneron said on Thursday about 74 percent of commercially insured lives and 91 percent of Medicare insured lives had access to Praluent, as of April 1.Unprecedented utilization criteria for the drug and tedious paperwork put in place by pharmacy benefit managers and health insurers had made access to Praluent difficult, Regeneron said on a call with analysts.However, the company said it had seen a recent improvement in the number of Praluent prescriptions that were filled.RBC Capital Markets analyst Adnan Butt said upcoming data from trials on Praluent's cardiovascular benefits will likely make insurers loosen their restrictions on the drug. ""That's the big catalyst the buyside is looking for - statistically significant difference that makes it difficult for payers to deny the benefit this class of drugs is showing.""The list price of Praluent is about $14,600 per year. Rival drug Repatha, made by Amgen Inc, has a list price of $14,100 per year.A federal jury ruled in March that Praluent infringes two Amgen patents, making matters worse for Regeneron.Praluent's first-quarter sales were about $13 million, falling short of the average analyst estimate of $15.6 million, JP Morgan analyst Cory Kasimov said. HOPE FOR EYLEA Regeneron raised sales growth forecast for Eylea, the success of which has powered much of Regeneron's explosive growth since late 2011.However, the drug's slowing sales in recent quarters have raised concerns about Regeneron's prospects, erasing a quarter of the company's market value in the past year. Regeneron said it expected sales of Eylea, which treats wet age-related macular degeneration among other eye disorders, to increase by 20-25 percent this year, compared with its previous estimate of about 20 percent. The drug's sales surged 54 percent last year.Regeneron's net income more than doubled to $165.7 million in the quarter ended March 31.Excluding items, Regeneron earned $2.57 per share, just missing the average analyst estimate of $2.58 according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Revenue rose to $1.20 billion, beating the average Wall Street estimate of $1.18 billion.Regeneron's shares were up 5.2 percent at $379.42 in late afternoon trading.

112,"   By Caroline Humer | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Chief Executive Leonard Schleifer on Thursday took aim at an influential drug pricing watchdog, saying a critique of the company's new cholesterol lowering therapy was non-scientific.The Boston-based Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) last fall reviewed two new potent cholesterol drugs called PCSK9 inhibitors. It concluded that the treatments should cost about 67 percent less than the list prices set by Regeneron with partner Sanofi, and by Amgen Inc.Health insurers have refused to cover the cost of the treatments in most cases, intensifying a high-profile fight over rising drug prices. ICER began doing value-based analyses last year with a review of new hepatitis C drugs, and has become a prominent voice casting doubt on the price and value of medications.Schleifer emphasized the importance of value-based drug pricing. On Wednesday, health insurer Cigna Corp said it had reached new reimbursement contracts for the cholesterol medicines based on how well they perform for patients. Speaking at the Financial Times U.S. Healthcare & Life Sciences Summit, Schleifer said ICER's method, which reduced the value of the treatments based on its assumption of what the United States could afford, lacked scientific basis.""They did all the calculations and they said it's X, which is ok. I could have lived with that. But ... they said society can't afford X, so we are going to say it's one-third X,"" Schleifer said during a panel discussion. ""They had value-based pricing, but they just decided that well we can't afford it. That wasn't scientific. There was no intellectual honesty there."" ICER Chief Operating Officer Sarah Emond, on a panel with Schleifer, countered that budget impact is part of the equation.

Insurers and the government say value-based pricing can help keep drug prices from climbing too fast.

Its new mechanism of action could make it a non-addictive alternative to opioids, the drugmakers said in a joint release. It is being tested in late-stage trials for osteoarthritis pain and in mid-stage studies for chronic low back pain. Rival U.S. drugmakers Eli Lilly and Co and Pfizer Inc plan by 2018 to seek approval for their similar medicine, tanezumab, which they are testing under a $1.8 billion deal reached in 2013. Teva, a generic drugmaker that sells the branded multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone, will pay Regeneron $250 million upfront and share equally in fasinumab's ongoing research costs of about $1 billion.

138,"   By Natalie Grover  Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc said a combination therapy containing its flagship eye drug, Eylea, was inferior to Eylea alone in a mid-stage trial involving patients with wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a leading cause of blindness in the elderly.Regeneron's shares fell 3.6 percent, and were the biggest drag on the Nasdaq biotech index. Shares of Ophthotech Corp, which is evaluating combinations of its experimental drug with Eylea or rival drugs, also fell.Eylea sales, which have powered Regeneron's explosive growth since late 2011, have been slowing in recent quarters, raising concerns about the biotechnology company's growth prospects.The blockbuster injection, which was developed with Germany's Bayer AG to treat macular degeneration and other eye disorders, generated U.S. sales of $831 million in the second quarter. Macular degeneration accounts for almost 50 percent of all cases of blindness in the developed world. It usually affects people over 50. Wet AMD, which is less common than dry AMD, is generally caused by abnormal blood vessels that leak fluid or blood into the retina.     Patients who received the combination of Eylea and experimental platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) inhibitor rinucumab were able to see 5.8 more letters on an eye chart test at 12 weeks, compared with a 7.5 letter improvement in those who were given Eylea alone.The main goal of the study was to show an improvement in visual clarity after three months of treatment. The combination therapy proved to be inferior and was associated with more side effects than the monotherapy.   Data will be evaluated at 28 weeks and 52 weeks, when the study is completed, Regeneron said on Friday.Eylea belongs to a class of drugs considered the standard of care in AMD as their use makes patients less likely to go blind or move into long-term care. Ophthotech Corp is evaluating combinations of its PDGF inhibitor, Fovista, with either Eylea, Roche Holding AG's Avastin or Novartis AG's Lucentis. Positive results from Ophthotech's late-stage trials, expected to read out this year, could see Regeneron lose market share to rival therapies, Leerink's Geoffrey Porges wrote in a client note.

Data will be evaluated at 28 weeks and 52 weeks, when the study is completed, Regeneron said on Friday.Eylea belongs to a class of drugs considered the standard of care in AMD as their use makes patients less likely to go blind or move into long-term care. Ophthotech Corp is evaluating combinations of its PDGF inhibitor, Fovista, with either Eylea, Roche Holding AG's Avastin or Novartis AG's Lucentis. Positive results from Ophthotech's late-stage trials, expected to read out this year, could see Regeneron lose market share to rival therapies, Leerink's Geoffrey Porges wrote in a client note. Ophthotech's stock was down about 14 percent at $46.49 in early trading, while Regeneron's shares slipped about 3 percent to $393.43.

142,"   By Natalie Grover  Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc and partner Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd said the U.S. health regulator placed a clinical hold on a study testing their pain treatment, dealing another blow to companies looking to develop a safer alternative to opioid painkillers.The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) imposed the hold in the mid-stage trial in patients with chronic lower back pain, after a form of joint damage was observed in an advanced osteoarthritis patient who was given a high dose of the injectable drug, fasinumab.Monday's announcement suggests fasinumab will be plagued by the same limitations as other drugs in its class, including heightened scrutiny, repeated delays, and labeling restrictions, Leerink Partners' Geoffrey Porges said.The brokerage reduced its probability of success for the drug to zero, and cut Regeneron's price target to $513 from $530.The treatment is designed to block nerve growth factor (NGF), a protein involved in transmission of pain signals.Fasinumab has the potential to be an alternative to prescription opioids, that are effective for pain relief but are  associated with high rates of addiction, overdose and death.     Following the FDA decision, Regeneron has completed an unplanned interim review of data and has stopped dosing patients, the companies said.The analysis showed clear evidence of an improvement in pain scores in patients dosed with fasinumab, compared with placebo.Regeneron was ""lucky"" to sell half the drug to Teva in a timely fashion,"" noted Sanford C.

The news of the hold comes less than a month after Regeneron announced the up to $1.3 billion deal with Teva to co-develop fasinumab.The two drugmakers now plan to discuss with the FDA a late-stage study for chronic lower back pain, excluding patients with advanced osteoarthritis.Fasinumab is also being tested for use in osteoarthritis-related pain. Rival drugmakers Eli Lilly and Co and Pfizer Inc plan by 2018 to seek approval for their similar treatment, tanezumab, which is being tested as part of a $1.8 billion collaboration.Regeneron has been attempting for years to develop an anti-NGF drug for pain, but has been stymied by safety concerns.The FDA had placed fasinumab and other experimental agents targeting NGF on partial clinical hold in late 2012, after reports that animals on the drugs had suffered nerve damage.The hold has since been lifted.

149,"   By Natalie Grover  Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc's (REGN.O) quarterly profit handsomely beat estimates, helped by lower costs and a smaller tax bill, even as sales growth of its flagship drug Eylea continued to slow.Eylea sales, which have powered Regeneron's explosive growth since late 2011, have been slowing in recent quarters, raising concerns about the U.S. biotechnology company's prospects.U.S. Eylea sales rose 16 percent to $854 million in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, in line with analysts' expectations.However, sales growth slowed from 27 percent in the second quarter and 44 percent in the first quarter.Regeneron is facing discounts and rebates from Eylea competitors, Chief Executive Leonard Schleifer said on a conference call.The drug, which treats macular degeneration among other eye disorders, competes with Roche Holding AG's (ROG.S) Avastin and Novartis AG's (NOVN.S) Lucentis. Eylea is being tested as a monotherapy and in combination with other drugs for various eye conditions.Sales will grow as the American population ages, and as the eye drug wins other approvals, company executives said.Sales of Regeneron and Sanofi SA's (SASY.PA) potent, but expensive, new cholesterol fighter Praluent jumped to $38 million from $4 million a year earlier, missing the average estimate of $40.5 million. The drug and Amgen Inc's (AMGN.O) rival drug Repatha are expected to rake in billions but have so far generated tepid sales as health insurers wait for evidence that they can reduce heart attacks before agreeing to pay for them. Regeneron on Friday said a second interim analysis of data from its ongoing cardiovascular study is expected by the end of November. Depending on the outcome, the study could be stopped either for futility or overwhelming efficacy.Regeneron and Sanofi's arthritis treatment, sarilumab, was rejected last week by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, over manufacturing deficiencies. It is too early to forecast a timeline for approval, Schleifer said, and indicated that Regeneron is looking to launch the drug at a price that insurers ""will find attractive.""    Excluding items, Regeneron earned $3.13 per share, beating the average analysts' estimate of $2.71 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Total revenue, which also includes collaboration revenue from partners Sanofi and Bayer (BAYGn.DE), rose 7.3 percent to $1.22 billion, missing the average estimate of $1.29 billion, due to lower collaboration revenue.Regeneron bumped up the lower end of its full-year sales growth forecast for Eylea.

156,"  Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals said on Thursday they would continue a large clinical outcomes study with their injectable cholesterol-lowering drug Praluent, confounding hopes of some investors for an early win.There had been an option for the trial to be stopped early if it showed overwhelming efficacy at the interim stage but an independent data monitoring committee recommended it should continue.Shares in Regeneron fell 4.5 percent in early New York trading following the news, while Sanofi was down 0.5 percent in Paris.The trial involves more than 18,000 patients from 57 countries and is designed to demonstrate that Praluent reduces the risk of serious cardiovascular events, like heart attacks and strokes.Some investors had thought the drug might be so effective that the trial, called Odyssey Outcomes, would be halted at the interim point, although many analysts had viewed this as an outside chance. Praluent could still prove itself at the final stage, when more data will have been amassed. The treatment belongs to a new class of medicines targeting the PCSK9 protein that maintains LDL cholesterol in the bloodstream. They work differently from statins, which block the liver's production of LDL cholesterol in the first place.Amgen sells a rival product called Repatha. Both Praluent and Repatha have been approved for sale based on earlier trials showing they lower LDL in patients whose cholesterol is not controlled by other drugs, those who cannot tolerate other drugs and people genetically predisposed to high cholesterol.Although the new drugs can slash LDL cholesterol almost 60 percent, the key to long-term demand is proof that this translates into fewer heart attacks and other cardiovascular problems in patients.

160,"  PARIS The European Medicines Agency (EMA), the European Union's health regulator, has accepted for review the Dupixent product being developed by drugmakers Sanofi and Regeneron, the companies said on Thursday.Dupixent is aimed at adults with eczema or moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD), who are candidates for systemic therapy.If cleared by regulators, Dupixent would be the first approved systemic treatment for eczema, which in severe cases produces infection-prone rashes and a constant itch as bad as poison ivy. Some analysts expect Dupixent to cost up to $30,000 a year and to capture eventual annual sales of more than $5 billion.A biologics license application (BLA) for Dupixent was accepted for Priority Review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in September.  As per the U.S. Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), the target FDA action date is March 29. The EMA and FDA have conditionally accepted Dupixent as the trade name for dupilumab.Eczema affects an estimated two percent of U.S. adults, and as many as 10 percent to 20 percent of children - the majority of cases being of mild to moderate severity.     Sanofi shares, which closed down 0.6 percent at 75.10 euros on Wednesday, are down by around 4.5 percent so far in 2016.
