0,"   By Lisa Baertlein  McDonald's Corp (MCD.N) reported weaker-than-expected quarterly sales at established restaurants on Thursday as fewer diners frequented the fast-food chain, and warned that sales would again fall short of analysts' expectations in January.The world's biggest restaurant chain by revenue has reported disappointing sales for five straight quarters, hurt by self-inflicted operational stumbles, weak demand and intensified competition from resurgent rivals such as Wendy's Co (WEN.O) and Burger King Worldwide Inc BKW.N.Indeed, efforts by Chief Executive Don Thompson to shore up earnings in the 18 months since he took the top job at the company - by tweaking menus and changing management - have not borne fruit.The pressure is on him to boost McDonald's share price as well. The stock is up just 7 percent since Thompson became chief executive on July 1, 2012, well behind the 27-percent jump in the Dow Jones Industrial Average index, of which McDonald's is a component.Analysts predicted that investors would give Thompson a bit more time to turn the company's fortunes before they begin to advocate for big changes.""If McDonald's doesn't fix itself by the end of 2014, the drumbeat of activism will grow,"" Hedgeye Risk Management analyst Howard Penney told Reuters.On a conference call with analysts, McDonald's executives said they ""over-complicated"" menus last year.They vowed to re-engage customers this year with plans that include customizing sandwiches, emphasizing breakfast and coffee, and increasing marketing via mobile phones and other devices. Some critics have called on McDonald's to simplify operations by downsizing its menu. Penney warned that the company's new plan to customize sandwiches could further slow service.Global sales at McDonald's restaurants open at least 13 months fell 0.1 percent during the fourth quarter, due in part to severe winter weather in the United States.Quarterly results were overshadowed by McDonald's forecast for ""relatively flat"" January global sales at restaurants open at least 13 months.The January forecast ""stands out as a healthy (same-store sales) miss,"" Wells Fargo restaurant analyst Jeff Farmer said in a client note. Analysts, on average, estimate a 2.4 percent gain in January.Analysts were optimistic that McDonald's sales trends would improve in January, largely because the company turned in lukewarm results in January 2013. PROFIT BEATS, SALES MISS McDonald's has about seven times the sales of Wendy's and Burger King combined, but has had less success than those rivals in tempting diners with limited-time specials and promotions.Hyped new products, such as Mighty Wings, flopped. Beyond that, the addition of lattes, smoothies, salads and wraps have slowed McDonald's service in a business where hyper-competitive drive-thru times are measured in seconds.McDonald's also switched its value-oriented ""Dollar Menu"" to the ""Dollar Menu & More"" in November with slightly higher prices. Executives said the heavily marketed new menu met internal performance targets, but didn't appear to draw more customers. Closely watched global same-restaurant sales in December were down 1.2 percent, versus a 0.6 percent gain expected by analysts polled by Consensus Metrix.The 3.8 percent drop in the United States was the biggest shortfall - analysts expected a decline of just 0.6 percent - but other regions also missed.The Asia Pacific, the Middle East and Africa (APMEA) region posted an unexpected 2.1 percent decline and Europe's 0.5 percent gain was about half what analysts expected.Fourth-quarter net income was flat at $1.40 billion, or $1.40 per share.Total revenue for the company, known for its crispy french fries and Big Mac hamburgers, grew 2 percent to $7.09 billion.Analysts on average were expecting the company to earn $1.39 per share on revenue of $7.11 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Still, shares ticked up 0.2 percent to $95.11 in afternoon trading.(Additional reporting by Siddharth Cavale in Bangalore; Editing by Joyjeet Das, Jilian Mincer, Bernadette Baum and Amanda Kwan)",2014-01-23,MCD,"Thu Jan 23, 2014 | 1:33pm EST","McDonald's gets fewer visits in quarter, expects weak January",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-mcdonalds-results-idUSBREA0M0XF20140123?type=companyNews

9,"   By Angela Moon | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Feb 7 After the S&P 500's first weekly gain in a month, investors will see next week whether the U.S. stock market's rally of the last two days is the shape of better things to come - or if this year's weakness will turn into a full-fledged correction.The S&P 500 rose 0.8 percent for the week, scoring a weekly gain for the first time since early January. The benchmark index closed above its 14-day moving average on Friday, the first time it traded above that level since Jan. 23.The 2.6 percent gain for Thursday and Friday marked the S&P 500's best two-day performance in four months. That rally helped Wall Street recover some ground from the latest slide, which had pushed the benchmark index down as much as 6 percent from its record closing high set on Jan. 15. Wall Street defines a stock market correction as a drop of at least 10 percent from the previous high. A bear market is a plunge of 20 percent from a previous peak.The recent selloff has created some severely oversold conditions that have ""now blossomed into buy signals, but there is still a much larger intermediate-term bearishness in place,"" Larry McMillan, president of McMillan Analysis Corp in Morristown, New Jersey, said in a note to clients.""The buy signals may generate a rally back to and through the 20-day moving average. But for anything more than that, the intermediate-term sell signals have to be reversed.""The S&P 500 fell 3.6 percent in January, its worst monthly loss since May 2012. Its 20-day moving average is currently at 1,804.25.In another check of the U.S. economy's health, January retail sales will be in focus. The data could offer more evidence that the economy lost some momentum at the start of the first quarter. On Friday, nonfarm payrolls data showed job creation in the United States slowed sharply over the past two months, raising the prospect that the economy may be losing strength.Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen will be in the spotlight as she testifies before U.S. lawmakers next week in her first public comments on monetary policy and the economy after taking the reins at the U.S. central bank. She will appear before the House Financial Services Committee on Tuesday and the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday.Yellen, a strong supporter of the Fed's easy-money policies,  will be responsible for ramping down a huge bond-buying program and, later, raising interest rates and shrinking the Fed's swollen balance sheet. FINAL CHRISTMAS SNAPSHOT The Commerce Department is expected to report on Thursday that retail sales were flat in January, held down by a drop in receipts at auto dealerships, after rising 0.2 percent in December. Even after stripping out autos, retail sales are seen barely rising.""That retail number is actually important because it includes the January gift card numbers, so that completes the Christmas picture,"" said Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors, in New York. On Thursday, a group of nine retailers that report comparable monthly sales posted a 3.6 percent rise for January, below the 4.9 percent pace a year earlier, according to Thomson Reuters. The data suggested that January was a tough end to the most competitive holiday season for U.S. retailers since the 2007-2009 recession.Next week's economic calendar will include weekly jobless claims on Thursday and January's industrial output on Friday. The preliminary February reading on consumer sentiment will also be released on Friday by Thomson Reuters and the University of Michigan.On Monday, McDonald's Corp will report January sales. Last month, the company reported weaker-than-expected quarterly sales at established restaurants as fewer diners frequented the fast-food chain. McDonald's warned that sales would again fall short of analysts' expectations in January.On the earnings front, companies ranging from Sprint Corp  to Cisco Systems Inc, Deere & Co, PepsiCo Inc and MetLife Inc will report their results.Thomson Reuters data showed that of the 343 companies in the S&P 500 that had reported earnings through Friday morning, 67.9 percent have topped Wall Street's expectations, slightly above the 67 percent beat rate for the past four quarters and ahead of the 63 percent rate since 1994.(Wall St Week Ahead runs every Friday.

10,"  * S&P 500 coming off best two-day gain in four months* McDonald's falls after January same-store sales data* Hasbro rallies after results, upbeat comments* Indexes up: Dow 0.1 pct, S&P 0.2 pct, Nasdaq 0.5 pctBy Ryan VlastelicaNEW YORK, Feb 10 U.S. stocks ended with modest gains on Monday as investors digested recent market gains and looked ahead to new Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen's first testimony before lawmakers.The Nasdaq was boosted by strength in large-cap tech and pharma names, but most market participants took a wait-and-see attitude ahead of the testimony, looking for confirmation that the Fed would not change its schedule for ending its support for the economy.The U.S. central bank's accommodative monetary policies have been credited with fueling the market's steep gains in 2013, and are expected to keep a floor under equity prices for as long as they continue.The Fed first announced a slowing in the bond-buying program in December, followed by another one in January. If it changes the pace of tapering - and uncertainty in emerging markets and the weak January payrolls have raised the odds of that to some - it may raise concerns that the economy is still not strong enough to strengthen on its own. ""We're hoping to hear Yellen strike a balance where she recognizes that the recovery is fragile, but not so much that the Fed changes its mind, which would be too premature of a signal to send,"" said Leo Grohowski, chief investment officer at BNY Mellon Wealth Management in New York.Yellen's prepared remarks will be available before the market opens on Tuesday. She will also participate in a question-and-answer session with U.S. lawmakers after the open.The Dow Jones industrial average was up 7.71 points, or 0.05 percent, at 15,801.79.

17,"   By Lisa Baertlein | LOS ANGELES  LOS ANGELES Raymond Tremblay, a loyal McDonald's Corp (MCD.N) customer from Los Angeles, thinks the fast-food chain sells tasty food at reasonable prices and he cannot think of a quick fix that would help end the company's disappointing U.S. performance.""I know it's there and it's always good,"" Tremblay, 46, said of McDonald's. ""Maybe we just kind of take it for granted.""Such customer feedback underscores the challenges faced by the world's biggest restaurant company, which has reported 19 months of turbulent sales at established U.S. restaurants amid sluggish economic growth, stepped-up competition and internal missteps that have complicated its menus and slowed service.In a recent call with analysts, McDonald's Chief Executive Officer Don Thompson vowed to ""create more of a coffee culture through high-quality McCafe products"" as well as to double-down on breakfast and sales of food priced around $1 -- in a bid to bolster sales.Once or twice a week, Tremblay makes a slight detour from his morning commute to pick up coffee and a sausage McMuffin with egg or a sausage burrito.He has bought the company's flavored coffees, but never orders the espresso drinks made from pricey McCafe machines that McDonald's franchisees installed to compete with Starbucks Corp(SBUX.O).Tremblay, a production artist for an animation firm, is happy when his favorite items are on sale - but he and other customers say that discounts are not enough to change their morning routines.Mel Yu, a 32-year-old automotive industry consultant from Grand Blanc, Michigan, still goes to McDonald's three to four times a week -- but that is down significantly from a decade ago, when McDonald's was just about the only place to grab a quick morning meal.These days, breakfast competition is fierce. Starbucks is introducing new pastries, fast-food chains Burger King BKW.N and Dunkin' Donuts (DNKN.O) have come on strong with food and drinks, and bakery chain Panera Bread (PNRA.O) has rapidly expanded.McDonald's owners in Yu's area have been couponing and matching discounts from competitors. Still, Yu said that has not increased the frequency of his visits to the Golden Arches: ""I'm going there anyhow."" McDonald's did not immediately respond to requests for comment via telephone or email.DOMESTIC RESTAURANT SALES FALL McDonald's on Monday said U.S. sales at restaurants open at least 13 months fell 3.3 percent in January - more than twice as steep as the drop that analysts polled by Consensus Metrix expected.McDonald's blamed the frigid cold and snow that hit large parts of the United States, but analysts said McDonald's domestic patrons continue to be pinched by the slow economy.It is a trend playing out across the industry. McDonald's and other restaurants that cater to the financially strapped low-to-middle income masses -- including Darden Restaurant Inc's (DRI.N) Olive Garden and Red Lobster chains -- are struggling to bring in sales.At the same time, Starbucks, Panera, Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG.N) and Darden's Capital Grille steak house, which cater to somewhat wealthier diners, are outperforming.KING OF BREAKFAST McDonald's was the undisputed leader in the U.S. quick-service breakfast category with 19 percent market share in 2013, according to Nielsen Co consumer data firm Scarborough.Its closest rivals last year were Starbucks and Dunkin' Donuts, each with 7 percent market share.""When you're No. 1, you've got one direction to go and that's down. Everybody's got a target on your back,"" Investment Technology Group restaurant analyst Steve West said. Some analysts expect investors to give Thompson, McDonald's CEO who took the helm in July 2012, most of this year to turn the ship.Thompson championed the McCafe push during his tenure as president of McDonald's USA from 2006 to 2010. That program required franchisees to renovate restaurants to create space for equipment, such as an espresso machine that cost between $10,000 and $15,000 per restaurant.The McCafe expansion -- which also included blended fruit smoothies and other drinks -- is widely viewed as a success.While regular coffee sales are reported to be brisk, some franchisees have complained in surveys that sales of espresso drinks fall far short of covering the cost of the high-maintenance machines that crank out lattes and mochas with the press of a button.Howard Penney, restaurant analyst at Hedgeye Risk Management, said McCafe is at the heart of McDonald's operational woes.Contrary to conventional wisdom, Penney says the McCafe business has been slowing down service and that the recent roll-outs of too many new food products and limited-time offers have only exaggerated the problem.For now, McDonald's is focusing on making its food preparation more efficient. It has called on restaurant operators to install a $25,000 to $50,000 ""high density table"" that stores sandwich toppings and other items. Executives say that new equipment will help workers turn out sandwiches and other food faster.If that investment does not boost sales at established restaurants in the second half of 2014, Penney said McDonald's would be forced to look at McCafe.""McCafe is a sacred cow right now,"" Penney said.(Reporting by Lisa Baertlein in Los Angeles; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)",2014-02-11,MCD,"Tue Feb 11, 2014 | 1:07pm EST","McDonald's looking to heat up U.S. sales with breakfast, coffee",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-mcdonalds-breakfast-idUSBREA1A0SW20140211?type=companyNews
18,"  By John WasikCHICAGO Feb 18 With U.S. stocks doing a stutter-step after a five-year bull run, a shift into low-volatility funds might give you a little more traction if the market retrenches.Low or ""minimum"" volatility funds have become more popular since the 2008 meltdown. Buying mostly defensive stocks with high dividends and modest price variations, they represent an $11 billion market for moderately risk-averse investors.The most popular fund in this category, the PowerShares S&P 500 Low-Volatility ETF, holds more than $3 billion in assets. It owns brand-name stocks like McDonald's Corp  and Johnson & Johnson, along with lesser-known companies like Sigma-Aldrich Corp.The fund, which charges 0.25 percent for annual management expenses, was up 14 percent for the year ended Feb. 12.A similar fund is the iShares MSCI USA Minimum Volatility ETF, which with slightly more than $2 billion in assets is a runner-up in terms of size in this group. It holds nearly half of its portfolio in consumer defensive, healthcare and financial services stocks like AT&T Inc, Wal-Mart Stores Inc and United Parcel Service Inc.The fund charges slightly less in annual expenses - 0.15 percent - and gained about 16 percent in the year through Feb. 12. But both it and the PowerShares ETF are lagging the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index, which is up 22 percent for that period.Although it is too early to tell, low-volatility funds might have a distinct advantage if the bull cycle has reached or surpassed its peak. If corporate earnings falter or global economies slow, the market may tilt toward value and dividend-rich stocks.To date, though, the low-volatility advantage has yet to appear. Both the S&P 500 and low-volatility shares are closely tracking each other, down slightly more than 1 percent year to date as of Feb. 12.DIVIDENDS WORTH GRABBING  Despite the desire to time the top of a bull market, it is tough to make an exit from growth stocks into high-dividend shares. Market peaks are notoriously difficult to discern.The most pressing question for a long-term investor is whether to tilt more toward value than growth. Until this year, growth stocks have had their run of the roost, but value may dominate if fear stalks the market.It is typical for low-volatility funds to bulk up on boring, dividend-rich sectors like consumer durable, healthcare and utilities.The PowerShares fund, for example, has nearly half of its portfolio in those three groups. Both it and the iShares fund have yields north of 2 percent, which reflect the higher payouts of those kinds of companies. Yet what appears to be a virtue can be a disadvantage, particularly if the bull has room to run and the market will still favor growth stocks.By their very staid nature, low-volatility funds may not outpace the S&P 500, which rose 32 percent last year with dividends reinvested, compared with 25 percent for the iShares fund.Instead of trying to guess where the market is going and reacting week to week, a dividend-growth strategy might prove potent in the long run. The Vanguard Dividend Appreciation Index ETF, which I hold in my 401(k), lagged the S&P 500 by only about 1 percentage point over the past three years.The Vanguard fund, which focuses on companies that consistently raise their dividends, is slightly more diversified than the other low-volatility funds I have mentioned. Its portfolio is more spread out among mega-, large- and medium-size companies with holdings like Abbott Laboratories, Procter & Gamble Co and PepsiCo Inc. It costs only 0.10 percent annually to own and was up 16 percent for the year ended Feb. 12.Companies paying lower but growing dividends may also be bargains, Matt Freund, chief investment officer of USAA Funds in San Antonio, stated in a recent market commentary.""Companies increasing their dividend payments are making a commitment to the market,"" Freund said. ""They are telling investors that their business is strong enough to generate the free cash needed to pay higher dividends in the future.""Whatever path you take, do not confuse low-volatility funds with no volatility. All low-volatility stock funds will still react to market swoons. The Vanguard fund, for example, was down more than 3 percent year to date through Feb. 12, compared with a 1.3 percent decline for the S&P 500.Concentrating too much on defensive stocks will certainly create a drag on performance if growth still dominates, but that may not be a bad thing if you want to focus on total return over the long haul.",2014-02-18,MCD,"Tue Feb 18, 2014 | 7:00am EST",COLUMN-Boring might be better for fund investors in 2014,http://www.reuters.com//article/column-wasik-volatility-idUSL2N0LI1GH20140218?type=companyNews
19,"   By James B. Kelleher and Nivedita Bhattacharjee | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Sick of hearing Americans complain about the winter weather? Too bad. Because the corporate kvetching has only just begun.While meteorologists say warmer temperatures finally are on the way, savvy investors know a cold front could still be looming when it comes to the profits of publicly traded U.S. companies.Indeed, if history is any guide, CEOs will still be moaning about the recent cold snap well into spring, when they report first-quarter earnings. Why? Because the coldest winter in a quarter century provides them with a handy -- and reasonably plausible -- excuse for any results that fall short of expectations.For some companies, such as those in transport-dependent businesses, the explanations may be valid. For others, it may well be a case of the (chilly) dog ate their homework.After Hurricane Katrina slammed into the U.S. Gulf Coast in 2005, a host of companies with not especially big exposures to the affected region - including Avon Products Inc., Books-A-Million Inc and Tempur-Pedic International Inc, now a unit of Tempur Sealy International Inc - blamed the disaster for poorer-than-expected results. When their rivals did just fine despite the hurricane, analysts cried foul.The latest weather-related claims have begun to come in. Recent U.S. economic indicators, including unexpected drops in retail sales and manufacturing output in January, showed the deep freeze is having an impact.Last week, McDonald's Corp partly pinned a fall in January sales at its established U.S. restaurants on the frigid cold and snow, while vitamin and nutritional supplements retailer GNC Holdings Inc warned that its first quarter results would fall short of expectations because of bad weather.Earlier this month, Ford Motor Co, CSX Corp and United Continental Holdings Inc have also warned that the severe cold weather is wreaking havoc on their operations in the first quarter.Analysts say experience shows it is inevitable some companies will use the severe temperatures and serial snow and ice storms as a cover to conceal problems, such as management missteps and other internal shortcomings. ""While managers will be quick to use weather as an excuse for soft earnings ... most sectors of the economy aren't impacted,"" said Matthew Patten, the president, Cutler Investment Counsel LLC.BEYOND RETAIL To be sure, this winter will go down in the record books as one of the coldest in recent history.""The last one that was this cold was the winter of 1993, 1994 - and this one is edging that one out,"" said Dale Mohler, a senior meteorologist with Accuweather, the private weather forecasting company. ""This is something that comes around maybe once every 25, 30 years.""Temperatures across a vast area of the United States, stretching east from the Great Plains through the Midwest and into the northern Appalachians, have been running 6 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit (3.3 to 5.5 degrees Celsius) below normal for two-and-a-half months straight. The weather clearly has discouraged some consumers from heading out to shop. U.S. retail sales fell 0.4 percent in January, led by a tumble in automobile sales and categories such as clothing, furniture stores and restaurants that depend on foot traffic.But the impact of the cold snap has extended beyond the retail industry. A number of U.S. companies, including Ingersoll Rand Plc and Emerson Electric Co, have complained about transportation and logistical problems that the snow and sub-zero temperatures have triggered.""We're all losing days of production, we're losing days of shipments,"" Emerson Chief Executive Officer David Farr told an investor conference last Thursday.U.S. airlines have been especially hard hit, with flight cancellations and delays soaring. In January alone, nearly 40,000 U.S. flights were canceled and another 136,000 delayed, according to FlightAware.com - four times the number affected by weather in any of three previous Januaries.As a result, most big airlines, including Delta Air Lines Inc, American Airlines Group Inc and United Continental have waived change fees and relaxed rebooking rules for customers who had tickets to fly through storm-hit airports.

20,"   By James B. Kelleher and Nivedita Bhattacharjee | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Feb 19 Sick of hearing Americans complain about the winter weather? Too bad. Because the corporate kvetching has only just begun.While meteorologists say warmer temperatures finally are on the way, savvy investors know a cold front could still be looming when it comes to the profits of publicly traded U.S. companies.Indeed, if history is any guide, CEOs will still be moaning about the recent cold snap well into spring, when they report first-quarter earnings. Why? Because the coldest winter in a quarter century provides them with a handy -- and reasonably plausible -- excuse for any results that fall short of expectations.For some companies, such as those in transport-dependent businesses, the explanations may be valid. For others, it may well be a case of the (chilly) dog ate their homework.After Hurricane Katrina slammed into the U.S. Gulf Coast in 2005, a host of companies with not especially big exposures to the affected region - including Avon Products Inc., Books-A-Million Inc and Tempur-Pedic International Inc, now a unit of Tempur Sealy International Inc - blamed the disaster for poorer-than-expected results. When their rivals did just fine despite the hurricane, analysts cried foul.The latest weather-related claims have begun to come in. Recent U.S. economic indicators, including unexpected drops in retail sales and manufacturing output in January, showed the deep freeze is having an impact.Last week, McDonald's Corp partly pinned a fall in January sales at its established U.S. restaurants on the frigid cold and snow, while vitamin and nutritional supplements retailer GNC Holdings Inc warned that its first quarter results would fall short of expectations because of bad weather.Earlier this month, Ford Motor Co, CSX Corp  and United Continental Holdings Inc have also warned that the severe cold weather is wreaking havoc on their operations in the first quarter.Analysts say experience shows it is inevitable some companies will use the severe temperatures and serial snow and ice storms as a cover to conceal problems, such as management missteps and other internal shortcomings. ""While managers will be quick to use weather as an excuse for soft earnings ... most sectors of the economy aren't impacted,"" said Matthew Patten, the president, Cutler Investment Counsel LLC.BEYOND RETAIL To be sure, this winter will go down in the record books as one of the coldest in recent history.""The last one that was this cold was the winter of 1993, 1994 - and this one is edging that one out,"" said Dale Mohler, a senior meteorologist with Accuweather, the private weather forecasting company. ""This is something that comes around maybe once every 25, 30 years.""Temperatures across a vast area of the United States, stretching east from the Great Plains through the Midwest and into the northern Appalachians, have been running 6 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit (3.3 to 5.5 degrees Celsius) below normal for two-and-a-half months straight. The weather clearly has discouraged some consumers from heading out to shop. U.S. retail sales fell 0.4 percent in January, led by a tumble in automobile sales and categories such as clothing, furniture stores and restaurants that depend on foot traffic.But the impact of the cold snap has extended beyond the retail industry. A number of U.S. companies, including Ingersoll Rand Plc and Emerson Electric Co, have complained about transportation and logistical problems that the snow and sub-zero temperatures have triggered.""We're all losing days of production, we're losing days of shipments,"" Emerson Chief Executive Officer David Farr told an investor conference last Thursday.U.S. airlines have been especially hard hit, with flight cancellations and delays soaring. In January alone, nearly 40,000 U.S. flights were canceled and another 136,000 delayed, according to FlightAware.com - four times the number affected by weather in any of three previous Januaries.As a result, most big airlines, including Delta Air Lines Inc, American Airlines Group Inc and United Continental have waived change fees and relaxed rebooking rules for customers who had tickets to fly through storm-hit airports. United Continental said the storms and sub-zero temperatures cost United $60 million in January alone. They ""were among the worst weather events in our history,"" said company spokesman Luke Punzenberger.SOUP SALES UP Mike Englund, chief economist at Action Economics, points out that the prolonged bad weather has been good news for some industries.

21,"  McDonald's big shot pushed DePaul past Seton HallROSEMONT, Ill. -- It may have been Durrell McDonald's birthday on Tuesday but the DePaul guard ended up delivering the gift.The Blue Demons sophomore hit a go-ahead 3-pointer with 2:55 to play as DePaul broke a 10-game losing streak with a 65-60 Big East victory over the Seton Hall Pirates at Allstate Arena.McDonald, now 20, connected just as the shot clock expired to give the hosts a 61-58 lead.""I looked right at the shot clock and as soon as I saw (the time left) I've got to shoot,"" McDonald said. ""I thought it was just confidence. When the game is tight you can't think about the game too much because that's when you start not playing your game.""Even the opposition was impressed.""He hit a tough shot, he's a good shooter,"" said Seton Hall coach Kevin Willard. ""With the shot clock running down we challenged it and that must have been a 35-footer and he made it."" Guard Brandon Young led a balanced attack with 19 points as the Blue Demons (11-18, 3-13) won for the first time in six weeks and escaped going 0-for-February.McDonald and guard Billy Garrett Jr. each scored 15 points apiece while forward Sandi Marcius added 10.""It started in practice today,"" McDonald said. ""We all just stayed strictly focused and played our game and came out with the W."" Forward Fuquan Edwin scored 21 points despite a sprained thumb to lead the Pirates (14-14, 5-9), who lost their second straight and fifth in six games. Guard Jaren Sina added 12 points.DePaul led 38-29 at halftime, but Seton Hall opened with a 13-4 run and tied the game at 42 on Edwin's fast-break layup with 15:10 to play.Edwin and Sina then hit back-to-back 3-pointers over a 58-second span as Seton Hall opened a 50-44 lead with 12:50 to play. DePaul rallied over the next four minutes to claim a 52-50 lead on McDonald's 3-pointer. From there, the game offered two lead changes and three ties until McDonald's shot clock-beating 3-pointer put DePaul up for good.DePaul trailed early, then used a 10-0 run over a span of 2:17 to open a 16-11 lead less than seven minutes into the game. The Blue Demons later had a pair of nine-point leads, the second coming at the 6:30 mark when forward Forest Robinson's 3-pointer made it 29-20.DePaul's lead hit double-digits with 90 seconds left as Marcius' layup opened a 36-26 lead. Marcius, who closed the half with 10 points, added a put back with two seconds showing to make it 38-29.The Blue Demons were 15 of 21 (71.4 percent) from the field in the first half, including four of eight from beyond the arc. Edwin paced the Pirates with 12 first-half points.""I thought our effort was okay,"" Willard said. ""I thought we got a little confused defensively. I wasn't a little shocked that we weren't a little more focused on the defensive end. But they came out and made some tough shots early ... and Young got them going.""NOTES: DePaul G Brandon Young needed just two points to become the sixth in school history with 1,800 points. ... The Blue Demons' 96-94 overtime loss to Marquette last Saturday snapped a run of 13 straight wins when they scored 80 or more points. ... A career-high 26-point effort in that game helped DePaul G Billy Garrett Jr. land Big East Rookie of the Week honors for the fifth time this season. ... Seton Hall G/F Fuquan Edwin landed on the Big East honor roll this week after averaging 16.5 points in two wins. ... The Pirates, who beat the Blue Demons 86-69 on Jan. 25 in South Orange, N.J., lead the all-time series 10-8 and have won seven of the last nine meetings. ...

22,"  MOSCOW Two members of the Russian protest group Pussy Riot were attacked by a group of men who poured rubbish and bright green paint over them and shouted obscenities at them at a McDonald's restaurant.An online video, uploaded by the group on Thursday, shows at least three men attacking Nadezhda Tolokonnikova and Maria Alyokhina, shouting ""(Go) to America!"" and shooting paint into their faces from syringes in the city of Nizhny Novgorod.""It hurts! Why are you doing this?"" Tolokonnikova says, with green stains on her face and hands. ""You don't have the right to hurt me. Please don't do that to anyone anymore.""Alyokhina said she suffered head injuries and Tolokonnikova had chemical burns. The men wore patriotic symbols - so-called St George ribbons which commemorate the victory over Nazi Germany in World War Two. Tolokonnikova and Alyokhina spent nearly two years in prison for performing a ""punk prayer"" in a protest against President Vladimir Putin in a Russian Orthodox church in Moscow.Celebrated in the West as activists who fight for freedom of speech, they are disliked by many people in Russia's socially conservative provinces, where support for Putin is strong. They were freed in December, and went to Sochi on the Black Sea coast last month to film an anti-Putin video while the city was hosting the Winter Olympics. They were briefly detained by police in Sochi and beaten with a whip by Cossacks, who were reinforcing security during the Games.Alyokhina said on Twitter that she and Tolokonnikova were attacked on their way to a local penal colony where she served her prison term. They said after their release from jail that they would fight for prisoners' rights. Tolokonnikova blamed local police for the attack. The police said they were investigating the case and declined to comment on the allegations. ""They can say it was a provocation by the law enforcement authorities. The law enforcement authorities can say it was a PR-stunt by Pussy Riot. We don't deal with rumors"", a police spokeswoman said.(This story was refiled to fix a typo in the fourth paragraph)(Writing by Maria Tsvetkova, Editing by Timothy Heritage)",2014-03-07,MCD,"Fri Mar 7, 2014 | 10:16am EST","Pussy Riot members attacked with green paint, rubbish",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-russia-pussyriot-idUSBREA2610920140307?type=companyNews
23,"   By Phil Wahba  McDonald's Corp (MCD.N) on Monday reported a bigger-than-expected drop in comparable global sales for February, hurt again by slow business in the United States.The world's biggest restaurant chain by revenue said worldwide sales at restaurants open at least 13 months fell 0.3 percent last month. That was below analysts' average estimate for a fall of 0.1 percent, according to Consensus Metrix.U.S. same-restaurant sales fell 1.4 percent, worse than the 0.6 percent decline that analysts had forecast.McDonald's Chief Financial Officer Pete Bensen said in a press release that the unchanged global comparable sales so far this year ""will pressure margins"" in the first quarter.McDonald's has reported nearly two years of turbulent sales at established U.S. restaurants amid sluggish economic growth, increased competition and internal missteps that have complicated its menus and slowed service. That performance is heaping pressure on Don Thompson, the chief executive of McDonald's since July 2012, who will face new challenges this year.Beef prices are hovering near record highs and expected to keep climbing. Labor costs also are increasing: several states have raised their minimum wage this year. Thompson said in a statement that McDonald's is ""intent on improving our business performance."" McDonald's said it is trying to draw more customers by improving customer service and menu changes.McDonald's is doubling down on breakfast and coffee to defend its No. 1 position in the United States as Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) debuts new breakfast sandwiches and Yum Brands' (YUM.N) Taco Bell chain gets into the game with food like waffle tacos.McDonald's again blamed the intense cold and snow that hit large parts of the country, but analysts have been quick to point out that McDonald's less-affluent U.S. patrons are still getting pinched by sluggish job growth and stagnant wages. In Europe, the company's biggest market by revenue, restaurant sales last month rose 0.6 percent.

""We did shrug off the (China data), almost as if was a non-event,"" said Peter Kenny, chief executive of Clearpool Group in New York.""I don't think it's disruptive to the way people are looking at China as an economy that has lost some of its hyperbolic move and that is almost welcome.""Freeport McMoRan Copper & Gold lost 2.6 percent to $31.35 as signs of a slowing China sent London copper to an eight-month low.

Are valuations justified?"" said Kenny.In a speech at the Bank of France, Philadelphia Fed President Charles Plosser said severe winter weather likely affected U.S. jobs growth in February, the latest U.S. central banker to suggest that some weakness in the labor market was only temporary, which suggested the Fed will stay on course in winding down its stimulus measures.

Cisneros, whose McDonald's restaurants are each operated by a separate corporation, said his companies had corrected ""mistakes"" and are now fully compliant.The New York attorney general's investigation found that from 2007 through mid 2013, Cisneros's restaurants at times required some of their 700 cashiers to work ""off-the-clock,"" or without pay, before or after their shifts. Some cashiers also were required to use their own money to cover cash register shortages. Other violations included failure to give employees an extra hour of pay at minimum wage when they worked more than 10 hours in a day, as mandated by state law. The restaurant operator also failed to either launder or to pay for the cost of cleaning employees uniforms, as required under New York state law.In December, New York's attorney general got 25 workers at a New York City Domino's Pizza Inc franchise reinstated after they were fired for speaking against alleged labor abuses.",2014-03-18,MCD,"Tue Mar 18, 2014 | 2:06pm EDT","New York McDonald's owner to pay $500,000 to settle worker claims",http://www.reuters.com//article/mcdonalds-settlement-wages-idUSL2N0MF12Y20140318?type=companyNews

Analysts on average were expecting $1.45 a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Revenue rose 3 percent to $11.3 billion, missing forecasts of $11.43 billion.The company said it expected to earn $6.55 to $6.80 a share for the year, down from its earlier outlook of $6.73 to $7.10.Analysts had forecast $6.89.While analysts expected weather conditions to hurt FedEx, it was difficult to estimate the financial impact without interim data, said Morningstar analyst Keith Schoonmaker.Shares of FedEx were down 0.4 percent at $137.99 in afternoon trading. ""While we were disappointed with the third-quarter earnings miss, the shortfall was due to weather-related costs,"" Deutsche Bank analyst Justin Yagerman wrote in a note to clients. ""FedEx remains one of our favorite ways to benefit from an improving economy.""FedEx's numbers provide the first real look at the impact the brutal winter had on the shipping industry.

44,"   By Lisa Baertlein  McDonald's Corp (MCD.N) is getting back to basics after a string of disappointing quarterly results in its home market of the United States, which accounts for 30 percent of overall revenue.The fast-food giant has reported roughly two years of turbulent sales at established U.S. restaurants due to sluggish economic growth, stiffer competition and internal missteps that have complicated menus and slowed service.Adding to the pressure, higher costs for beef, chicken and labor are squeezing profits because customers are cutting back on visits as McDonald's raises prices to offset the additional expenses.Chief Executive Don Thompson said on Tuesday that McDonald's is launching a ""reset initiative"" in the United States that would include tweaking staffing to improve speed during peak hours and putting more focus on affordability and core menu items, such as the Big Mac, Egg McMuffin and french fries. These core items account for 40 percent of sales.The CEO, who took the helm at the Golden Arches in July 2012, urged investors to be patient.""This is not about a silver bullet. It is important to underscore that it will take time for consumers to notice the changes and reward us with increased visits,"" Thompson said on a conference call with analysts.Sales at U.S. restaurants open at least 13 months fell a steeper than expected 1.7 percent in the first quarter. McDonald's prices were up 3 percent during the quarter and traffic fell, suggesting push-back from diners. The lackluster results from McDonald's landed a few days after Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (CMG.N), the popular burrito chain it spun off in 2006, said its first-quarter same-restaurant sales jumped 13.4 percent.Chipotle caters to a wealthier consumer than McDonald's and it serves on-trend food, including dishes made with organic produce and antibiotic-free meats.

""Our government has been clear,"" he said in the statement.

57,"   By Lewis Krauskopf and Lisa Baertlein | NEW YORK/LOS ANGELES  NEW YORK/LOS ANGELES Rebecca Sumrow is one of the customers food and restaurant company executives have in mind when they consider raising prices to offset higher costs as meat and milk soar to record highs.The 30-year-old from San Clemente, California, was out of work for a short time last year and saved money by moving in with her boyfriend and cutting back on clothes shopping and dining out. Though she now has a good job working for an investment firm, she's maintaining her frugal ways.Consumers ""have gotten really good over these last four years at stretching a penny,"" said Pat Conroy, leader of the U.S. consumer products practice at Deloitte LLP. Referring to the recession, he said, ""Our hypothesis was that this thing was going to leave a scar, not a bruise. So far, we've been right.""According to Deloitte's annual survey of food shoppers released last week, 94 percent agreed they would remain cautious and keep spending at the same level even if the economy improves. That's about the same percentage as it was in 2010 in the aftermath of the credit crisis.So Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (CMG.N), McDonald's Corp (MCD.N), Hillshire Brands Co HSN.N and Kraft Foods Group Inc KRFT.O, all of which are raising prices, will be trying to retain consumers stuck with stagnant incomes and unhappy memories of the recession. Faced with little choice but to boost prices to cover the spike in costs for products like milk and meat, companies often are taking extra care to justify or soften the increases.COLD CUTS AND BACON Kraft has raised, or will soon increase, prices on about 45 percent of the products in its portfolio, including cheese, cold cuts and bacon. Hillshire raised the prices on Jimmy Dean sausage and Ball Park hot dogs as retail pork prices hit a record high of $1.99 a pound in March, from $1.40 a pound a year ago, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. McDonald's eliminated its ""dollar menu"" last year to give it flexibility to raise prices to offset high costs for meat and other ingredients.Chipotle is one of the few companies expected to have the power to raise prices due to its popularity with higher income diners. The burrito chain is increasing menu prices this quarter, but only after giving customers a benefit by removing almost all food ingredients made with genetically modified organisms, or GMOs. ""You're hearing that they want to, but the question always becomes: Can it stick?"" said Prudential Financial market strategist Quincy Krosby, referring to raising prices. ""What the consumer has been very good about is going on strike.""That's happening now in the dairy aisle. As U.S. milk prices go up, shoppers buy less, according to Dean Foods Co (DF.N), the largest U.S. milk processor. Fluid milk industry volumes fell 2.1 percent in the first quarter, according to Dean.""There are certain price thresholds that we can't cross, or it starts to impact the demand,"" Dean Chief Executive Gregg Tanner said on a conference call with analysts last week. ""We experienced additional softness in our volumes during March and April.""The wholesale price for beverage milk was about $2.10 per gallon in May, a record, and up 38 percent from a year ago, according to dairy analyst Jerry Dryer. In March, retail milk prices were up only 6.5 percent, suggesting that retailers are eating much of the cost increase, he said.INFLATION TARGET  U.S. consumer prices rose 1.5 percent in March from the year earlier, led by food and housing rental costs. An index of inflation tracked by the Federal Reserve is running even lower at 1.2 percent, against the central bank's target of a 2 percent inflation rate.Many consumers are still struggling in a tough labor market. Labor force participation remains depressed. Private-sector wages were unchanged in April and over the past 12 months have averaged monthly increases of just 0.16 percent.""There's still a large swath of the population that just doesn't have the spending power,"" said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott.Pricing issues already have changed the fortunes of Whole Foods Market Inc (WFM.O) and McDonald's, which are battling rivals that emerged from the recession willing to start price wars. McDonald's raised prices late last year in a bid to protect profits from higher meat costs. Its customers, who tend to earn less than those who frequent Chipotle, voted with their feet and U.S. sales at established restaurants have not posted a monthly gain since October.Whole Foods, the leading natural and organic grocer nicknamed ""Whole Paycheck"" because of a perception among some consumers of high prices, has seen same-store sales growth cool as mainstream food sellers add more organics and undercut it on price.Its most aggressive rival could be Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), which in the United States will introduce 100 Wild Oats-branded organic packaged food products ranging from olive oil to black beans in about 2,000 stores in coming months.Walmart, which tends to cater to lower-income shoppers and sells more groceries than any other domestic retailer, said those products would be priced on par with conventional rivals and at least 25 percent below branded organic foods.""It's really hard for Whole Foods to start a price war. It's really easy for Walmart,"" said Wolfe Research retail analyst Scott Mushkin.For her part, Sumrow says she's spending more time in the dollar store produce aisles and less time in upscale places like Whole Foods, though she still splurges on things like unpasteurized milk for about $6 a gallon and fresh spinach, kale and chard for her daily juicing ritual. She's not inclined to loosen up her spending anytime soon, even though she's making more money.""We have to be very careful with our finances to be able to get anywhere,"" she said, adding that neither she nor her sister plan to have children because it doesn't make financial sense. ""We have to tighten our belts and invest wisely and try to get established when everything is working against us.""(Additional reporting by Lisa Richwine in Los Angeles, Theopolis Waters in Chicago and Lucia Mutikani in Washington; Editing by Jilian Mincer and John Pickering)",2014-05-14,MCD,"Wed May 14, 2014 | 8:17am EDT",Frugal U.S. consumers make it tough for food companies to raise prices,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-usa-prices-food-analysis-idUSBREA4D03X20140514?type=companyNews

""We need to show McDonald's that we're serious and that we're not backing down,"" said Davis, who earns $8.98 per hour at a Chicago McDonald's.McDonald's, which is grappling with sagging U.S. sales and higher beef prices, does not disclose average pay for restaurant workers, most of whom work for franchisees.According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the 3.5 million fast-food and counter workers in the United States earn a median hourly wage of $8.83.

68,"  (Repeats with no change to text)By Lisa Baertlein and Ross KerberLOS ANGELES/BOSTON May 20 The next big showdown in the running battle over U.S. executive pay is shaping up to be the annual meeting of McDonald's Corp on Thursday, but critics may have a tough time replicating their victory last week at Chipotle Mexican Grill.McDonald's is a main target of protesters and labor groups, who criticize the world's biggest fast-food chain for paying millions of dollars to its chief executive while many front-line restaurant workers are scraping by at or near minimum wage.""For too many CEOs, it's heads I win, tails I win,"" said New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer in an interview on Tuesday. CEOs often get well paid no matter how a company performs, Stringer said.Stringer said his office would vote the 2.6 million shares of McDonald's held in the city's pension funds against an advisory measure on executive pay, and that some investors worry income inequalities could threaten profit. ""You can't grow the economy the way we need to if low-wage workers don't have the money to spend on goods and services,"" he said.Stringer's funds also voted against the pay at Chipotle, whose co-CEOs Steve Ells and Monty Moran received total 2013 compensation of $25.1 million and $24.4 million, respectively. McDonald's Chief Executive Don Thompson made $9.5 million in 2013, down from $13.8 million in 2012.Chipotle shareholders offered a scant 23 percent support for a similar advisory pay proposal at the popular burrito seller on May 15, which has earned praise for eye-popping stock gains and scorn for supersizing compensation for its co-CEOs. But at least two big public pension fund managers that opposed Chipotle's pay proposal said they would support pay for McDonald's executives, including Thompson. The managers were the California State Teachers' Retirement System (CalSTRS) and the Florida State Board of Administration.Aeisha Mastagni, a CalSTRS Investment Officer, said the pay contests are quite different and noted how McDonald's market capitalization of $100 billion is more than six times that of Chipotle's.

CEOs often get well paid no matter how a company performs, Stringer said.Stringer said his office would vote the 2.6 million shares of McDonald's held in the city's pension funds against an advisory measure on executive pay, and that some investors worry income inequalities could threaten profit.""You can't grow the economy the way we need to if low-wage workers don't have the money to spend on goods and services,"" he said. Stringer's funds also voted against the pay at Chipotle, whose co-CEOs Steve Ells and Monty Moran received total 2013 compensation of $25.1 million and $24.4 million, respectively. McDonald's Chief Executive Don Thompson made $9.5 million in 2013, down from $13.8 million in 2012.Chipotle shareholders offered a scant 23 percent support for a similar advisory pay proposal at the popular burrito seller on May 15, which has earned praise for eye-popping stock gains and scorn for supersizing compensation for its co-CEOs.But at least two big public pension fund managers that opposed Chipotle's pay proposal said they would support pay for McDonald's executives, including Thompson. The managers were the California State Teachers' Retirement System (CalSTRS) and the Florida State Board of Administration.

74,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, May 28 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the ratings of McDonald's  Corporation (NYSE: MCD) after the firm's three-year total cash return  announcement. Fitch has affirmed the ratings as follows: --Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A'; --Bank credit facilities at 'A'; --Senior unsecured debt at 'A'; --Short-term IDR at 'F1'; --Commercial paper at 'F1'.  The Rating Outlook is Stable. At March 31, 2014, McDonald's had $13.9 billion of  total debt.  Key Rating Drivers:  Three-Year Total Cash Shareholder Return Target  The affirmation of McDonald's ratings follows the company's announcement that it  intends to return $18 billion - $20 billion of cash to shareholders between 2014  and 2016 through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. The  commitment represents a 10% - 20% increase over the $16.4 billion returned over  the 2011 - 2013 year period. The firm also expects to refranchise at least 1,500  restaurants and reallocate resources related to general and administrative  expenses toward higher return initiatives, including its digital capabilities.  McDonald's financial strategy has consistently been to reinvest in its business,  return cash to shareholders, and maintain credit statistics appropriate for an  'A' credit rating.  The firm has not articulated how much incremental debt it will incur to fund its  three-year return commitment. However, Fitch believes the vast majority will be  funded with internally generated cash flow, proceeds from refranchising, and  other sources of liquidity in order to maintain current ratings.    Fitch projects that McDonald's can generate over $21 billion of cumulative CFO  during the three-year period ended 2016. Management expects capital expenditures  to be between $2.9 billion and $3 billion in 2014 but has not provided guidance  for subsequent years. Potential proceeds from refranchising have not been  disclosed. McDonald's last major refranchising transaction was the sale of 1,571  units in Latin America during 2007, which resulted in $648 million of net  proceeds. Credit metrics are expected to remain acceptable for current ratings but a  slight increase in leverage would eliminate room to accommodate additional  weakening of same-store sales (SSS), operating income, and margins. Two years of  flat to negative global SSS and continued margin contraction concurrent with a  material increase in debt could lead to a negative rating action.  Substantial Cash Flow Generation McDonald's cash flow from operations (CFO) has grown at an 8% compound annual  growth rate since 2003 to $7.1 billion in 2013. CFO growth slowed recently due  to more modest sales and operating income growth but remains substantial. Free  cash flow (FCF - defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures  and dividends) has averaged $1.5 billion since 2003. A re-acceleration of  operating earnings and cash flow growth, driven by McDonald's efforts to  reignite SSS, would minimize any incremental debt required to meet its  three-year return target.  Strong Global Market Position McDonald's is the world's largest restaurant company based on nearly $90 billion  of system-wide sales and a widely respected brand. At Dec. 31, 2013, the system  had 35,429 worldwide units and during the year McDonald's generated $28.2  billion of total revenue and $8.8 billion of operating income. The firm's  geographic segments and their percentage of 2013 revenue and operating income  were: the U.S. (32% and 43%), Europe (40% and 38%), APMEA (Asia/Pacific, Middle  East, and Africa) (23% and 17%), and Other Countries and Corporate (5% and 2%). Significant Franchise Revenue At Dec. 31, 2013, franchisees and affiliates operated 81% of McDonald's units  while the remaining 19% were company-operated. Revenue from franchising totaled  $9.2 billion or 33% of McDonald's total revenue in 2013. Revenue from  franchising includes sales-based royalties and contractual rent payments.  McDonald's owns about 45% of the land and 70% of the buildings for its system of  restaurants. Net property and equipment had a book value of $25.7 billion at  Dec. 31, 2013. Fitch views McDonald's plan to refranchise at least 1,500 units  with an emphasis on APMEA and Europe favorably but expects the firm to continue  to operate a material percentage of its units. Proven Operating Strategy McDonald's three global priorities include optimizing its menu, modernizing the  customer experience, and broadening accessibility to its brand. Annual global  SSS have only declined twice since 1997, despite multiple economic recessions.  McDonald's long-term, average annual constant currency financial targets include  3% - 5% system sales and 6% - 7% operating income growth.  Fitch views McDonald's system sales goals as achievable given the firm's net  restaurant expansion. Management expects net restaurant additions of 949 units,  in line with the increase in 2013, to add about 2.5% to system-wide sales in  2014. Operating income growth, however, could continue to be below target levels  over the near term as costs continue to rise and efforts to regain SSS momentum  take time to resonate with consumers. For 2014, McDonald's expects commodity  costs to increase 1% - 2% in the U.S. and Europe.  First Quarter 2014 Operating Performance: McDonald's revenue increased 3% to $6.7 billion and operating income rose 1% to  $1.9 billion on a constant currency basis during the first quarter ended March  31, 2014. Global SSS grew 0.5% reflecting higher average check and a 3.1%  decline in guest counts. SSS in the U.S. were negative 1.7% while comparable  sales growth was positive 1.4%, 0.8%, and 6.1% in Europe, APMEA, and the Other  Countries and Corporate segment, respectively.  McDonald's combined operating margin declined 60 basis points (bps) versus the  2013 comparable quarter to 28.9%. The decline was due mainly to lower margins in  franchise operations. Franchise margin fell 60 bps to 81.1% due mainly to  negative SSS in the U.S. and higher rent expense in Europe, and APMEA. Global  company-operated restaurant margin declined 10 bps to 16.1%. Fitch believes an intensified focus around customer service along with continued  emphasis on value and menu variety will help McDonald's regain SSS momentum by  late 2014. The firm is focused on improving traffic trends across the U.S.,  Germany, Australia, and Japan and is investing in reimaging and other efforts to  reconnect with and remain relevant to consumers. Credit Statistics:  For the latest 12 month period ended March 31, 2014, total debt-to-operating  EBITDA and rent-adjusted leverage (total debt plus eight times gross rent  expense divided by EBITDA plus gross rents) were 1.4x and 2.4x, respectively.  Rent-adjusted interest coverage (EBITDAR divided by gross interest expense plus  gross rent) was 4.6x and funds from operations (FFO) fixed charge coverage was  3.9x. McDonald's FCF margin to sales was 5.1%. Significant Liquidity, Manageable Maturities:  McDonald's liquidity at March 31, 2014, totaled $4.2 billion and consisted of  $2.7 billion of cash and full availability under the firm's undrawn $1.5 billion  committed revolver, which expires Nov. 1, 2016. Aggregate maturities of  long-term debt as of March 31, 2014 were zero in 2014, approximately $1.2  billion in 2015 and roughly $900 million in 2016. About 60% of the firm's $13.9  billion of debt at March 31, 2014 was U.S. denominated and roughly 40% was  foreign denominated. Rating Sensitivities: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a positive  rating action include:  --An upgrade is not anticipated in the intermediate term given McDonald's recent  SSS trends, margin contraction, and plan to partially finance share buybacks  with incremental debt.  Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a negative  rating action include:  --Total debt-to-operating EBITDA and rent-adjusted leverage sustained over  approximately 1.5x and 2.5x, respectively, and materially lower FCF;  --Two years of flat to negative global SSS and continued margin contraction; --Weak or declining operating cash flow concurrent with meaningful incremental  debt.

75,"  BEIJING The murder of a woman at a fastfood restaurant in China has sparked a national outcry after it was revealed she was beaten to death for allegedly refusing to give her telephone number to members of a banned religious group.The 37-year-old woman was attacked by a group of people who were described as being members of the Church of Almighty God religious movement, state media reported. The group preached a global apocalypse would take place in 2012 and has been banned by Chinese authorities.The attack occurred last Wednesday at a McDonald's restaurant in northeastern Shandong province and was captured on surveillance video, the official Xinhua News Agency said in a commentary. Video footage of the attack was shown on China Central Television on Saturday.Six alleged group members, including four from one family, have been arrested over the attack, state media reported.        ""The audacity of the cult members to terrorize their victim at a McDonald's, a chain frequented by average Chinese, further racked people's nerves,"" Xinhua said. Apart from shock and anger, many social media users condemned onlookers, who failed to stop the assault in coastal Zhaoyuan city, about 160 km north of Qingdao.""If I stay quiet today, who will help me cry for help when I suffer from misfortunes in the future?,"" asked one Weibo user.

78,"  McDonald's Corp MCD.N on Monday reported a small rise in global sales at established restaurants for May, after a rebound in China helped offset another month of disappointing results from the fast-food chain's home market of the United States.McDonald's U.S. sales at restaurants open at least 13 months were down 1 percent in May, marking the seventh straight month of declines as it struggles with stiff competition from resurgent rivals such as Wendy's Co WEN.O and Burger King Worldwide Inc BKW.N, internal missteps that have slowed service and image-denting protests from its minimum-wage workers.Analysts polled by Consensus Metrix had expected May same-restaurant sales to rise 0.1 percent for the United States, which accounted for 31 percent of McDonald's revenue in 2013.

Europe, which contributed 40 percent of revenue last year and is McDonald's top region for sales, put up a gain of 0.4 percent, just shy of the 0.5 percent rise analysts expected.McDonald's shares were trading at $101.45, down 0.5 percent.

81,"  (Recasts with announcement of changes)By Randall PalmerOTTAWA, June 20 Restaurants operated by McDonald's Corp and others in Canada will face tough restrictions on bringing in temporary foreign workers under reforms announced by the government on Friday to address an outcry over perceived abuses of the system.Employment Minister Jason Kenney introduced the changes after news reports said that foreign workers had displaced Canadians working at some McDonald's outlets. The subsequent backlash had spurred the government to suspend a program under which restaurants could bring in any number of temporary foreign workers.The program had been designed to help provide labor for the booming resource industry but ended up mushrooming in the low-skill fast-food industry, raising questions about whether this was good for the economy or fair to Canadians who could not find work.""Sometimes they don't bother calling young Canadians who drop off their resumes, and that really ticks me off,"" Kenney said of employers using the program. Here are highlights of the changes he announced:- Low-wage temporary foreign workers will be able to make up no more than 10 percent of the work force of companies with 10 or more employees, as of mid-2016. In a transition period, foreign employees will be frozen at 30 percent of a work force or at current levels, whichever is less, and then at 20 percent in mid-2015.- In areas with an unemployment rate of 6 percent or more, temporary foreign workers will not be allowed to fill the lowest-wage, entry-level positions. - The government fee per foreign worker will rise to C$1,000 ($930) from C$275, for required ""labor-market impact assessments,"" which will now only be valid for one year instead of two.- Employers seeking to hire high-wage temporary foreign workers will have to submit transition plans to demonstrate how they will increase efforts to hire Canadians through higher wages, training and/or more active recruitment. One goal of the reforms is to shift the emphasis back to bringing in higher-skilled foreign employees and not just as many foreign workers for low-wage jobs as companies can hire.""Countries in the western world that have based their migration policies on large numbers of low-skilled people have ended up regretting the economic consequences,"" Kenney told a news conference.Asked about the example of meat-packing plants that are unable to operate at full capacity because of labor shortages, he responded: ""Yes, we could expand our GDP and our economy almost infinitely if we just opened up our borders to...an infinite number of new people, but this is not a sensible economic or immigration policy.""The new rules will cause problems for some restaurant owners, he said, but he pointed to resource boom areas in Western Australia and North Dakota, where, he said, restaurants are operating without cheap foreign labor.($1=$1.075 Canadian)   (Editing by Peter Galloway)",2014-06-20,MCD,"Fri Jun 20, 2014 | 4:25pm EDT",UPDATE 1-Canada curbs use of temporary foreign workers by restaurants,http://www.reuters.com//article/canada-employment-temporary-idUSL2N0P11AV20140620?type=companyNews

84,"   By Steve Holland | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON President Barack Obama has chosen former Procter & Gamble Chief Executive Bob McDonald, an Army veteran, as his nominee to be the next secretary of veterans affairs, a senior Obama administration official said on Sunday.Obama's announcement of McDonald, 61, will be made this week, possibly on Monday. If confirmed by the Senate, McDonald would be tasked with repairing the Veterans Administration after widespread evidence of delays in military veterans getting healthcare at VA facilities.The announcement is to come days after a White House review found significant and chronic failures across the board at the Veterans Administration and evidence that a ""corrosive culture"" prevails.A senior administration official said Obama was attracted to McDonald by his corporate background and military service. He would succeed Eric Shinseki, who resigned late in May after the depth of the VA's problems became clear.McDonald is the former chairman, president and CEO of Procter & Gamble, having retired a year ago after 33 years with the Fortune 500 company, where he started as a brand assistant in 1980 and rose through the ranks.He served on the McKinsey Advisory Council, the Singapore International Advisory Council of the Economic Development Board, and on the boards of U.S. Steel and Xerox Corp.Officials believe his lengthy tenure at P&G prepares him well for a huge agency with management challenges in providing services to more 8 million veterans a year. At P&G, he oversaw more than 120,000 employees, with operations around the world, selling products in more than 180 countries. MILITARY BACKGROUND U.S. House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner called McDonald ""a good man, a veteran, and a strong leader with decades of experience in the private sector. With those traits, he's the kind of person who is capable of implementing the kind of dramatic systemic change that is badly needed and long overdue at the VA.""But Boehner, the top Republican in Congress, added: ""The next VA secretary can only succeed in implementing that type of change if his boss, the president, first commits to doing whatever it takes to give our veterans the world class health care system they deserve by articulating a vision for sweeping reform. Our nation's veterans deserve nothing less.""After graduating in the top 2 percent of his class at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, McDonald served in the U.S. Army as a captain, primarily in the 82nd Airborne Division, and received the Meritorious Service Medal.    ""Bob is an immensely gifted and caring individual.  That was evident to me when we first met as cadets at West Point, over 40 years ago,"" retired Major General James ""Spider"" Marks said in a statement. ""He came from a military family, and knows the challenges from living them.""Corporate colleagues of McDonald repeatedly cited his management abilities in grappling with large and complex organizations.    American Express Chief Executive Ken Chenault, who served on the P&G board during McDonald's time there, called McDonald a strong manager who knows how to make large organizations work effectively.""He's an excellent choice to set the right course for the Veterans Administration at a difficult time,"" Chenault said in a statement. The White House review, which was conducted by senior Obama aide Rob Nabors, said the agency's 14-day scheduling standard for new patients to receive care was arbitrary, ill-defined and misunderstood.Obama accepted the findings on Friday by Nabors and acting Veterans Secretary Sloan Gibson, who said: ""We can and must solve these problems as we work to earn back the trust of veterans.""

90,"   By Adam Jourdan and Lisa Baertlein | SHANGHAI/LOS ANGELES  SHANGHAI/LOS ANGELES Yum Brands Inc and McDonald's Corp are facing a new food safety scare in China, denting the fast-food companies' efforts to shore up reputations and businesses that were hurt by a 2012 safety scandal in one of their biggest markets. McDonald's and KFC parent Yum apologized to customers on Monday after Chinese regulators shut a local meat supplier following a TV report that showed workers picking up meat from a factory floor, as well as mixing meat beyond its expiration date with fresh meat. The companies said they immediately stopped using the supplier, Shanghai Husi Food Co Ltd, a unit of Aurora, Illinois-based OSI Group, and had switched to alternatives. They added that the factory served restaurants in the Shanghai area.The report on China's Dragon TV brought Yum and McDonald's  back into the firing line following the sales-battering 2012 scandal that involved chicken pumped with excessive amounts of antibiotics.""We will not tolerate any violations of government laws and regulations from our suppliers,"" said Yum China, which required all of its KFC and Pizza Hut restaurants to seal up and stop using all meat materials supplied by the Husi factory.  The division, Yum's No. 1 business unit, had just seen its KFC restaurants bounce back from the double whammy of the food safety scare and a bird flu outbreak.""If proven, the practices outlined in the reports are completely unacceptable to McDonald's anywhere in the world,"" a China-based spokeswoman for McDonald's told Reuters. Husi provided McDonald's with chicken, beef and lettuce, a McDonald's U.S. spokeswoman said.China is McDonald's third-biggest market as measured in number of restaurants. ""I think this is going to be really challenging for both these firms,"" said Benjamin Cavender, Shanghai-based principal at China Market Research Group.    ""I don't know that this is something an apology can fix so easily, because at this point people don't have a whole lot of trust that they have good systems in place,"" he added. Yum shares fell 4.2 percent to close at $74.13 and McDonald's shares lost 1.5 percent to $97.55.""Although the issue is being addressed, we would not rule out the possibility of temporary sales disruptions,"" Baird analyst David Tarantino said in a research note lowering his target price on the company.    The Shanghai Municipal Food and Drug Administration shut  Husi down on Sunday after the local Chinese TV broadcast aired. In addition to the meat safety violations, the program showed workers saying that if clients knew what they were doing, the firm would lose its contracts.OSI said on its Chinese website that management was ""appalled by the report."" The company said it has formed its own investigation team, is fully cooperating with government inspectors and will take all necessary actions based on results of the investigation.    ""Management believes this to be an isolated event, but takes full responsibility for the situation,"" OSI said. OSI, which has close to 60 manufacturing facilities worldwide and had revenue of more than $5 billion in 2012, has been supplying McDonald's in China since 1992 and KFC and Pizza Hut parent Yum since 2008, according to its website. SUPPLY CHAIN ISSUES McDonald's and Yum are the top two brands by sales in China's $174 billion fast-food market, according to Euromonitor, but face a challenge as local firms try to tempt cost-conscious diners with healthy, home-grown fare.    Both companies said they are investigating the issues highlighted in the report and said that switching suppliers will cause some temporary product shortages.News of the scare spread quickly to diners negotiating Shanghai's lunch-hour rush on Monday. ""For now I won't go to eat at McDonald's or KFC, at least until this whole thing settles down,"" said Xu Xinyu, 24, a financial services worker, eating at a noodle shop near a McDonald's outlet in downtown Shanghai. Yet Chinese consumers may already have developed a comparatively thick skin when it comes to food scandals. ""Isn't everywhere like this?"" asked student Li Xiaoye, 20, eating a beef burger in a Shanghai McDonald's outlet. ""I'll keep going because wherever I eat, the issues are all the same.""      The incident highlights the difficulty in ensuring quality and safety along the supply chain in China. Wal-Mart Stores Inc came under the spotlight this year after a supplier's donkey meat product was found to contain fox meat. It also came under fire for selling expired duck meat in 2011.OSI is one of McDonald's key meat suppliers and has a good reputation, according to an industry insider speaking on condition of anonymity.

91,"  * Meat supplier shut down after safety violations exposed* TV footage shows workers picking up meat from floor* Yum, McDonald's warn of potential China product shortfalls* Incident highlights broader China food supply chain issues   (Adds analyst's comment, Burger King share reaction)By Adam Jourdan and Lisa BaertleinSHANGHAI/LOS ANGELES, July 21 Yum Brands Inc  and McDonald's Corp are facing a new food safety scare in China, denting the fast-food companies' efforts to shore up reputations and businesses that were hurt by a 2012 safety scandal in one of their biggest markets.McDonald's and KFC parent Yum apologized to customers on Monday after Chinese regulators shut a local meat supplier following a TV report that showed workers picking up meat from a factory floor, as well as mixing meat beyond its expiration date with fresh meat.The companies said they immediately stopped using the supplier, Shanghai Husi Food Co Ltd, a unit of Aurora, Illinois-based OSI Group, and had switched to alternatives. They added that the factory served restaurants in the Shanghai area.The report on China's Dragon TV brought Yum and McDonald's  back into the firing line following the sales-battering 2012 scandal that involved chicken pumped with excessive amounts of antibiotics.""We will not tolerate any violations of government laws and regulations from our suppliers,"" said Yum China, which required all of its KFC and Pizza Hut restaurants to seal up and stop using all meat materials supplied by the Husi factory.The division, Yum's No. 1 business unit, had just seen its KFC restaurants bounce back from the double whammy of the food safety scare and a bird flu outbreak.""If proven, the practices outlined in the reports are completely unacceptable to McDonald's anywhere in the world,"" a China-based spokeswoman for McDonald's told Reuters. Husi provided McDonald's with chicken, beef and lettuce, a McDonald's U.S. spokeswoman said.China is McDonald's third-biggest market as measured in number of restaurants.""I think this is going to be really challenging for both these firms,"" said Benjamin Cavender, Shanghai-based principal at China Market Research Group.""I don't know that this is something an apology can fix so easily, because at this point people don't have a whole lot of trust that they have good systems in place,"" he added.Yum shares fell 4.2 percent to close at $74.13 and McDonald's shares lost 1.5 percent to $97.55.""Although the issue is being addressed, we would not rule out the possibility of temporary sales disruptions,"" Baird analyst David Tarantino said in a research note lowering his target price on the company. The Shanghai Municipal Food and Drug Administration shut  Husi down on Sunday after the local Chinese TV broadcast aired. In addition to the meat safety violations, the program showed workers saying that if clients knew what they were doing, the firm would lose its contracts.OSI said on its Chinese website that management was ""appalled by the report."" The company said it has formed its own investigation team, is fully cooperating with government inspectors and will take all necessary actions based on results of the investigation.""Management believes this to be an isolated event, but takes full responsibility for the situation,"" OSI said.OSI, which has close to 60 manufacturing facilities worldwide and had revenue of more than $5 billion in 2012, has been supplying McDonald's in China since 1992 and KFC and Pizza Hut parent Yum since 2008, according to its website.SUPPLY CHAIN ISSUES  McDonald's and Yum are the top two brands by sales in China's $174 billion fast-food market, according to Euromonitor, but face a challenge as local firms try to tempt cost-conscious diners with healthy, home-grown fare.Both companies said they are investigating the issues highlighted in the report and said that switching suppliers will cause some temporary product shortages.News of the scare spread quickly to diners negotiating Shanghai's lunch-hour rush on Monday.""For now I won't go to eat at McDonald's or KFC, at least until this whole thing settles down,"" said Xu Xinyu, 24, a financial services worker, eating at a noodle shop near a McDonald's outlet in downtown Shanghai.Yet Chinese consumers may already have developed a comparatively thick skin when it comes to food scandals. ""Isn't everywhere like this?"" asked student Li Xiaoye, 20, eating a beef burger in a Shanghai McDonald's outlet. ""I'll keep going because wherever I eat, the issues are all the same.""The incident highlights the difficulty in ensuring quality and safety along the supply chain in China. Wal-Mart Stores Inc  came under the spotlight this year after a supplier's donkey meat product was found to contain fox meat.  It also came under fire for selling expired duck meat in 2011.OSI is one of McDonald's key meat suppliers and has a good reputation, according to an industry insider speaking on condition of anonymity. He added the incident highlights the issue firms face enforcing strict processes with local staff.As well as Yum and McDonald's, OSI listed Starbucks Corp , Japan's Saizeriya Co Ltd, Papa John's International Inc, Burger King Worldwide Inc  and Doctor's Associates Inc's Subway brand as clients in China, according to a 2012 press release.Burger King shares fell 1.6 percent to close at $26.13.A Starbucks spokesman told Reuters that the company does not now have any direct business dealings with Husi Food.Burger King, Subway, Papa John's and Saizeriya did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

97,"  SHANGHAI, July 21 U.S. fast food chains McDonald's Corp and Yum! Brands Inc said they will stop using products supplied by a local meat processor after a Shanghai regulator halted the firm's operations on Sunday over food safety concerns.The move is a potential concern for the two brands, which are both now conducting their own investigation into the matter, since the pair were hit hard by a food safety scandal in China late in 2012. Yum, which apologised to Chinese consumers for any inconvenience caused in the latest case, suffered a sharp dive in profits early in 2013 after the safety concerns.The Shanghai Food and Drug Administration (SFDA) halted the operations of Shanghai Husi Food Co., Ltd, a meat supplier suspected of providing meat that had passed its expiration date to China branches of McDonald's restaurants and Yum's KFC and Pizza Hut outlets, the Xinhua news agency reported on Sunday. The SFDA inspected Shanghai Husi on Sunday evening after a local television channel broadcast a programme claiming an undercover reporter had seen the use of expired meat and poor hygiene practices in a local factory, local media said. Yum and McDonald's both said they have stopped using meat products purchased from Shanghai Husi, according to statements posted on their official Weibo microblog sites.

98,"  Quarterly profit at McDonald's Corp fell more than expected after established restaurants in its struggling U.S. division turned in a third straight quarterly sales decline and results from Europe also logged a surprise drop.   Weakness in the world's biggest hamburger chain's two top markets, coupled with its warning of a global fall in same-restaurant sales for July, also helped send McDonald's shares down 1.1 percent in early trading on Tuesday.McDonald's gets about 30 percent of its revenue from the United States, where sales at restaurants open at least 13 months fell 1.5 percent in the second quarter. Traffic remained depressed amid tough competition from a range of rivals, which include Wendy's Co, Burger King Worldwide Inc and privately held Chick-fil-A.Analysts had expected McDonald's U.S. comparable sales to fall just 0.3 percent, according to research firm Consensus Metrix.McDonald's results stood in sharp contrast to Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc, which on Monday reported a 17.3 percent jump in same-restaurant sales at its predominantly U.S. burrito restaurants. McDonald's said ongoing weakness in Germany was partly to blame for the 1 percent same-restaurant sales decline in Europe, which just beats out the United States as the fast-food chain's top revenue market. Analysts had expected a gain of 0.7 percent, according to Consensus Metrix.The Asia-Pacific, Middle East and Africa (APMEA) region rose 1.1 percent. The results got a boost from China, which just recovered from food safety and bird flu scares but now is embroiled in a new controversy over a major supplier's meat handling methods. ID:nL4N0PX0CK] Still, the region's results were light compared with analysts' call for a rise of 1.5 percent.Second quarter net income fell almost 1 percent to $1.39 billion, or $1.40 per share, missing analysts' average profit estimate by 4 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

99,"   By Adam Jourdan | SHANGHAI  SHANGHAI The latest food scandal in China is spreading fast, dragging in U.S. coffee chain Starbucks, Burger King Worldwide Inc and others, as well as McDonald's products as far away as Japan.McDonald's Corp and KFC's parent Yum Brands Inc apologized to Chinese customers on Monday after it emerged that Shanghai Husi Food Co Ltd, a unit of U.S.-based OSI Group LLC, had supplied expired meat to the two chains.On Tuesday, Starbucks said some of its cafes previously sold products containing chicken originally sourced from Shanghai Husi, a firm that was shut down on Sunday by local regulators after a TV report showed staff using expired meat and picking up meat from the floor to add to the mix.A Tokyo-based spokesman at McDonald's Holdings Co (Japan) Ltd said the company had sourced about a fifth of its Chicken McNuggets from Shanghai Husi and had halted sales of the product on Monday. Alternative supplies of chicken have been found in Thailand and China, he added. The company's shares briefly fell as much as 1.4 percent to a 15-month low before closing down 0.4 percent.China's food watchdog said it ordered regional offices to carry out spot checks on all firms which had used Shanghai Husi products, and would inspect all of parent OSI's sites around China to see if enough has been done to ensure food safety. It said the case could be handed over to the police.The regulator's Shanghai branch said in a statement on Tuesday it had demanded production, quality control and sales records from OSI. It added it already ordered McDonald's to seal over 4,500 boxes of suspected meat products and Yum's Pizza Hut to seal over 500 boxes of beef.Fast-food chain Burger King and Dicos, China's third-ranked fast food chain owned by Ting Hsin International, said they would remove Shanghai Husi food products from their outlets. Pizza chain Papa John's International Inc said on its Weibo blog that it had taken down all meat products supplied by Shanghai Husi and cut ties with the supplier. FOOD SAFETY CONCERNS Food safety is one of the top issues for Chinese consumers after a scandal in 2008 where dairy products tainted with the industrial chemical melamine led to the deaths of six infants and made many thousands sick. Other food scandals have hit the meat and dairy industries in recent years, and many Chinese look to foreign brands as offering higher safety standards.  China is McDonald's third-biggest market by number of restaurants and Yum's top market by revenue. McDonald's is due to report quarterly earnings later on Tuesday.The scare has stirred local consumers and become one of the most discussed topics online among the country's influential 'netizens', with some users spreading long lists of firms thought to be tarnished.The incident highlights the difficulty in ensuring quality and safety along the supply chain in China. Wal-Mart Stores Inc came under the spotlight early this year after a supplier's donkey meat product was found to contain fox meat. It also came under fire for selling expired duck meat in 2011.Starbucks said on its Chinese microblog site that it had no direct business relationship with Shanghai Husi, but that some of its chicken acquired from another supplier had originally come from Husi for its ""Chicken Apple Sauce Panini"" products. This had been sold in 13 different provinces and major cities. The company added that all the products had already been removed from its shelves. Burger King said in a Weibo statement posted late on Monday that it had taken off its shelves all meat products supplied by Shanghai Husi Food and had launched an investigation.Dicos said it pulled all ham products supplied by Shanghai Husi, and would stop serving its ham sandwich product for breakfast. ""We will continue to carry out a probe into Shanghai Husi Food and its related firms, to understand whether or not it followed national regulations,"" Dicos said in a statement.Swedish furniture firm IKEA [IKEA.UL], which has in-store food outlets, said on Weibo that Shanghai Husi had previously been a supplier, but had not provided the firm with products since September last year. Domino's Pizza Inc and Doctor's Associates Inc's Subway brand, which were named in online reports as being supplied meat from Shanghai Husi, said their outlets in China did not use meat products from the firm.Yoshinoya-parent Hop Hing Group Holdings Ltd, Japanese convenience store FamilyMart Co Ltd and Chinese chain Wallace urged diners not to worry, and said they did not currently use any products from Shanghai Husi.

100,"  (Adds details on results, China meat scandal, Chipotle results)July 22 Quarterly profit at McDonald's Corp  fell more than expected after established restaurants in its struggling U.S. division turned in a third straight quarterly sales decline and results from Europe also logged a surprise drop.Weakness in the world's biggest hamburger chain's two top markets, coupled with its warning of a global fall in same-restaurant sales for July, also helped send McDonald's shares down 1.1 percent in early trading on Tuesday.McDonald's gets about 30 percent of its revenue from the United States, where sales at restaurants open at least 13 months fell 1.5 percent in the second quarter. Traffic remained depressed amid tough competition from a range of rivals, which include Wendy's Co, Burger King Worldwide Inc  and privately held Chick-fil-A.Analysts had expected McDonald's U.S. comparable sales to fall just 0.3 percent, according to research firm Consensus Metrix. McDonald's results stood in sharp contrast to Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc, which on Monday reported a 17.3 percent jump in same-restaurant sales at its predominantly U.S. burrito restaurants.McDonald's said ongoing weakness in Germany was partly to blame for the 1 percent same-restaurant sales decline in Europe, which just beats out the United States as the fast-food chain's top revenue market. Analysts had expected a gain of 0.7 percent, according to Consensus Metrix. The Asia-Pacific, Middle East and Africa (APMEA) region rose 1.1 percent. The results got a boost from China, which just recovered from food safety and bird flu scares but now is embroiled in a new controversy over a major supplier's meat handling methods. ID:nL4N0PX0CK] Still, the region's results were light compared with analysts' call for a rise of 1.5 percent.Second quarter net income fell almost 1 percent to $1.39 billion, or $1.40 per share, missing analysts' average profit estimate by 4 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.McDonald's shares were trading at $96.07 at in late morning trading. The stock traded at all-time highs above $100 in May.

Alternative supplies of chicken have been found in Thailand and China, he added. The company's shares briefly fell as much as 1.4 percent to a 15-month low before closing down 0.4 percent. China's food watchdog said it ordered regional offices to carry out spot checks on all firms which had used Shanghai Husi products, and would inspect all of parent OSI's sites around China to see if enough has been done to ensure food safety. It said the case could be handed over to the police.The regulator's Shanghai branch said in a statement on Tuesday it had demanded production, quality control and sales records from OSI. It added it already ordered McDonald's to seal over 4,500 boxes of suspected meat products and Yum's Pizza Hut to seal over 500 boxes of beef.Fast-food chain Burger King and Dicos, China's third-ranked fast food chain owned by Ting Hsin International, said they would remove Shanghai Husi food products from their outlets. Pizza chain Papa John's International Inc said on its Weibo blog that it had taken down all meat products supplied by Shanghai Husi and cut ties with the supplier. FOOD SAFETY CONCERNS Food safety is one of the top issues for Chinese consumers after a scandal in 2008 where dairy products tainted with the industrial chemical melamine led to the deaths of six infants and made many thousands sick. Other food scandals have hit the meat and dairy industries in recent years, and many Chinese look to foreign brands as offering higher safety standards. China is McDonald's third-biggest market by number of restaurants and Yum's top market by revenue. McDonald's is due to report quarterly earnings later on Tuesday.The scare has stirred local consumers and become one of the most discussed topics online among the country's influential 'netizens', with some users spreading long lists of firms thought to be tarnished.The incident highlights the difficulty in ensuring quality and safety along the supply chain in China.

105,"  (Adds industry context, analyst and company comment, byline)By Lisa BaertleinJuly 21 Burrito chain Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc  last quarter achieved what many of its rivals could only dream of: It raised prices, yet attracted more diners during a period of sluggish economic growth.The Denver-based chain on Monday reported a nearly 26 percent jump in second-quarter profit after sales at established restaurants surged 17.3 percent.The better-than-expected results prompted Chipotle to boost its full-year same-restaurant sales forecast, and its shares rose almost 10 percent in after-hours trading to $648.80.Chipotle is known for serving antibiotic-free meats and organic produce, which appeal to trend-setting teen and young adult diners. Investors love the chain because its restaurants crank out more and more sales without increasing costs.Rival Panera Bread Co was on a similar trajectory until last year, when ""operational friction"" caused it to stumble on speed. Executives at Chipotle said speed of service is at record levels, due to its focus on nurturing top-performing staff and its use of technology that helps analyze and improve performance.""We are the fastest we have ever been at lunch time and at dinner time, but the averages throughout the entire day are speeding up as well,"" Chipotle co-Chief Executive Monty Moran said on a conference call with analysts.And, he said, service can get faster still. Investment Technology Group restaurant analyst Steve West agreed.""I wouldn't bet against Chipotle until they prove otherwise,"" said West, who noted that bears for years have wagered that Chipotle would hit its limit on service times.Based on last quarter's gains, Chipotle raised its forecast for 2014 same-restaurant sales growth to a mid-teen percentage range, from a single digit estimate previously. The company is an outlier in the U.S. restaurant industry, whose same-store sales rose just 0.3 percent in the second quarter, according to Black Box Intelligence, which tracks 19,000 restaurants.It is difficult for restaurants to raise prices when same-store sales growth is anemic, and McDonald's executives likely will face pricing questions after the company reports quarterly results on Tuesday morning.Chipotle boosted prices to help offset higher costs for ingredients like beef, avocados and dairy. While more people ate at the chain, some diners did switch from pricey beef to lower-cost chicken, executives said.Chipotle also has begun buying grass-fed, antibiotic-free beef from Australia to help ease tight supplies, co-Chief Executive Steve Ells said.Chipotle's stock, which was trading at around $400 a year ago, closed at $589.93 on Monday, valuing the company at more than $18 billion. That was twice as much Burger King Worldwide , but still significantly less than former owner McDonald's Corp, with its market value of more than $96 billion.

And, until that process is completed, McDonald's said it would continue to buy food from Husi's factory in the northern province of Hebei.OSI Group Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Sheldon Lavin apologized to its China customers in a statement on Wednesday and reiterated that he has teams on the ground to address the problems. ""What happened at Husi Shanghai is completely unacceptable,"" Lavin said. ""We will bear the responsibility of these missteps, and will make sure that they never happen again.""KFC and Pizza Hut parent Yum, McDonald's and coffee chain Starbucks Corp are among the global brands that pulled products from their outlets after the news broke that Shanghai Husi supplied expired meat to clients in China as well as in Japan, in the latest in a series of food scandals in the country.Earlier, the official Xinhua news agency cited the Shanghai food and drug watchdog as saying that food-safety violations at Shanghai Husi were company-led rather than the acts of individuals.In its statement, Yum said: ""It is difficult to believe and completely unacceptable that the management of Shanghai Husi ... would oversee and organize illegal and dishonest operations.""Yum, which has 6,400 restaurants in China, also terminated its relationship with OSI in Australia and the United States. Yum said that OSI is not a major supplier and that ending the partnerships with OSI should not disrupt its business. DIFFERENT STANDARDS A Chinese TV report on Sunday set off a storm of controversy after it showed staff at the Shanghai Husi facility using meat that had expired and had been lying on the floor.Huang Denggang, 20, worked as a night cleaner at that Husi plant, a modern warehouse compound in a Shanghai suburb, for more than a year, but does not plan to return when it reopens because of lower-than-expected pay and a medical claim.He told Reuters on Wednesday that he had seen workers pick up raw meat from the floor and put it back into processing containers.""The leader didn't say anything when you throw it back,"" he said at a local job agency where he works during the day. Huang, who showed Reuters his Husi payslip as verification of his employment there, also said he had seen some workers handling raw meat without wearing gloves.""If you wear gloves,"" he said, ""maybe it slows you down if you want to pick up the chicken pieces because they're slippery."" He added, however, that he did not work in that part of the factory.Another Husi worker, who gave only the surname Zhang, said by telephone that he had worked on the production line, breaking up chicken into pieces, but had quit because of the low pay.""When (raw meat) drops, they usually don't see it, and even if they do, it was fine to pick it up and put it back,"" he said. ""There was an attitude of 'it doesn't really matter.'""The former employees' comments contrasted with what one worker at another of OSI's food-processing plants in Langfang in the northern Chinese province of Hebei told Reuters. He said that rules there were very strict, all workers needed to wear special clothes, and unannounced spot checks were often held.""The inspections are done by everyone: our own company, the government and also clients like McDonald's,"" said the worker, surnamed Wei, as he took a break at a nearby supermarket. He said the Hebei factory, which according to its website processes meat, vegetables and flour products, was still open for business despite government inspections.DOCTORED RECORDS Xinhua also cited Gu Zhenhua, deputy head of the Shanghai Municipal Food and Drug Administration, as saying that Shanghai Husi's controls systems and records for suspected products violated Chinese regulations.In the Dragon TV documentary on Sunday, staff at the Shanghai Husi facility said they kept two record books on food products, one of which was doctored to be shown to anyone who came to audit the facility. According to the report, which claimed to show an inspection of the facility by McDonald's, Shanghai Husi staff learned of the visit a day in advance and made sure that only compliant products were being processed on the day.The Shanghai food watchdog also said it had sealed more than 1,000 tonnes of suspected meat products from OSI in China and another 100 tonnes of products from various customers.(Additional reporting by Ran Kim, Shimizu Ritsuko and Olivier Fabre in Tokyo, Adam Jourdan in Shanghai, Lisa Baertlein in Los Angeles and Tom Polansek in Chicago; Editing by Ian Geoghegan, Jilian Mincer, Lisa Von Ahn and Jan Paschal)",2014-07-23,MCD,"Wed Jul 23, 2014 | 7:00pm EDT",WRAPUP 2-Yum cuts ties to owner of China meat plant after scandal,http://www.reuters.com//article/china-food-idUSL2N0PY1RG20140723?type=companyNews

It gave no other details.McDonald's, Yum Brands Inc, the parent company of KFC and Pizza Hut, and coffee chain Starbucks Corp are among global brands to have pulled products from their outlets after it emerged that Shanghai Husi supplied expired meat to clients in China, as well as Japan, in the latest in a series of food safety scandals in the country.Earlier, the official Xinhua news agency cited the Shanghai food and drug watchdog as saying that food safety violations at Shanghai Husi were company-led rather than the acts of individuals.

""There was an attitude of 'it doesn't really matter'.""The former workers' comments contrasted with what one worker at another of OSI's food processing plants in Langfang in the northern Chinese province of Hebei told Reuters. He said that regulations there were very strict, all workers need to wear special clothes, and spot checks were often held unannounced. ""The inspections are done by everyone: our own company, the government and also clients like McDonald's. Our rules are very strict and food safety standards are very high,"" said the worker, surnamed Wei, as he took a break at a nearby supermarket. He added the Hebei factory, which processes meat, vegetables and flour products according to its website, was still open for business despite ongoing government inspections.""DOCTORED RECORDS"" Xinhua also cited the Shanghai food watchdog's deputy head Gu as saying that Shanghai Husi's controls systems and records for suspected products violated Chinese regulations.In the Dragon TV documentary on Sunday, staff at the Shanghai Husi facility said they kept two record books related to food products, one of which was doctored to be shown to anyone who came to audit the facility. According to the report, which claimed to show an inspection of the facility by McDonald's, Shanghai Husi staff were aware a day in advance of the visit and made sure that only compliant products were being processed on the day.Separately, the Shanghai food watchdog said it had sealed more than 1,000 tonnes of suspected meat products from OSI in China, and a further 100 tonnes of products from a range of its customers.In Japan, a spokesman for Seven & I Holdings Co Ltd  said a licensee in Shanghai had been selling two hamburger products using meat supplied by Shanghai Husi. Both products were removed from outlets on Monday.A spokeswoman for FamilyMart Co Ltd said the Japanese convenience store chain had begun a supply deal with Shanghai Husi this month, selling a ""Garlic Nugget"" product at its around 10,000 stores in Japan. Another product, ""Popcorn Chicken"" began test-sales mainly in Tokyo this week. Sales of both products were halted on Tuesday. The company said there were no reports of any customers falling sick from the products.""I am deeply sorry for causing this trouble and worry to all those involved,"" FamilyMart President Isamu Nakayama told reporters in Tokyo. ""We do not think there is any problem with our operating structure but the very fact that this happened means that I think that additional checks should be put into place to help reassure consumers.""On Tuesday, McDonald's Holdings Co (Japan) Ltd said the company had sourced about a fifth of its Chicken McNuggets from Shanghai Husi and had halted sales of the product on Monday.

109,"  (Adds CEO comment, byline)By Lisa BaertleinJuly 24 Dunkin' Brands Group Inc cut its 2014 outlook on Thursday as its U.S. doughnut shops battled fast-food rivals like McDonald's Corp and high milk prices softened profits from its international Baskin-Robbins ice cream business.Shares of the company, which also reported disappointing second-quarter sales at its established U.S. Dunkin' Donuts franchises, dropped nearly 5 percent in morning trading.The company also cited weakness in its Baskin-Robbins joint venture in Japan for the reduction in its 2014 forecast.Dunkin' Brands now expects earnings of $1.73 to $1.77 per share, excluding special items, for this year. Its prior forecast called for $1.79 to $1.83.The company said it expected sales growth of 5 percent to 7 percent, down from previous expectations of 6 percent to 8 percent. U.S. Dunkin' Donuts shops account for roughly three-quarters of the Canton, Massachusetts-based company's overall revenue. It lowered its 2014 same-store sales growth target for those stores to 2 percent to 3 percent from 3 percent to 4 percent previously.Sales at established Dunkin' Donuts franchises in the United States rose 1.8 percent in the second quarter. Analysts polled by Consensus Metrix had expected a 3.3 percent increase.Executives blamed a cold and rainy start to the spring season, coupled with rampant discounting by fast-food chains. McDonald's, Dunkin' Donuts' chief competitor, on Tuesday said sales at its established U.S. restaurants fell a steeper-than-expected 1.5 percent in the second quarter.The world's biggest hamburger chain gave away free coffee during the quarter to defend its dominance in the U.S. fast-food breakfast market from existing competitors and new entrants such as Yum Brands Inc's Taco Bell chain.""It's a bit of a fistfight,"" said Dunkin' Brands Chief Executive Officer Nigel Travis, who forecast a continued brawl for market share in the popular coffee and breakfast businesses. Commodity pressures, however, could ease in the second half. In particular, experts expect global milk prices to decline as increased supplies come to market.Dunkin Brands' total second-quarter revenue rose 4.6 percent to $190.9 million, below the analysts' average estimate of $198.5 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Net income attributable to Dunkin' Brands rose 13 percent to $46.2 million, or 43 cents per share.Excluding amortization and other charges, earnings were 47 cents per share, in line with analysts' estimates.Shares of Dunkin' Brands were down 4.9 percent at $41.80 on Nasdaq.

Jobless claims fell to the lowest since mid-February 2006, pointing to continued strength in the labor market, but new home sales fell 8.1 percent in June, the most in almost a year, and May's initial reading of a more than 18 percent gain was revised to just above 8 percent, putting a damper on sentiment as the housing market struggles.""Housing certainly seems to be the one theme that prevents this economic recovery and earnings story from being a fairly tale, it is the one reminder there are issues,"" said Peter Kenny, chief market strategist at Clearpool Group in New York.He said the bullishness behind the strong job numbers was partly offset by market concern that it could translate into a faster route to normalizing monetary policy. However, earnings season is ""really quite solid, largely hitting on all cylinders in terms of top and bottom line and revenue growth.""The Dow Jones industrial average rose 7.51 points or 0.04 percent, to 17,094.14, the S&P 500 gained 0.66 points or 0.03 percent, to 1,987.67 and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 4.10 points or 0.09 percent, to 4,469.60. At its session high, the S&P was 0.5 percent away from hitting 2,000.Facebook was the poster child for strong earnings following a better-than-forecast 61 percent increase in revenue during the second quarter. Shares jumped 5.6 percent to $75.30, giving the social media giant a market capitalization of $193 billion, roughly the sum of Dow components McDonald's  and UTX.Sports apparel manufacturer and retailer Under Armour  jumped 10.5 percent to $67 after quarterly revenue rose by more than a third. On the flip side D.R. Horton, the No.1 U.S. homebuilder, fell 8 percent to $22.77 after it reported a 23 percent slump in third-quarter profit.The housing data also hurt homebuilders, with a sector index  down 1.6 percent.Ford shares rose 1.4 percent to $18.03 after profit beat expectations while GM dropped 4 percent to $35.87 on a lower second-quarter profit due to numerous recalls and the expected cost of at least $400 million for its victims' compensation fund.Drugmakers Bristol-Myers Squibb and Eli Lilly  both beat Wall Street expectations, helped by cost controls. Bristol shares edged up 0.4 percent to $49.54 and Eli Lilly dipped 0.3 percent to $64.03.Markets earlier got support from an expansion in China's factory activity and the euro zone's private sector.

116,"  HONG KONG McDonald's Corp has suspended sales of chicken nuggets and other items in Hong Kong after it said it imported products from Shanghai Husi Food, the U.S.-owned Chinese company at the center of a food safety scare in China. McDonald's said it imported certain products from Shanghai Husi between July last year and June this year, although no food items from the Shanghai supplier remained in stock. In Japan, McDonald's Holdings Co (Japan) said on Friday it would halt all imports of chicken products from China and shift that business to Thailand, boosting purchases from existing suppliers McKey Foods Services (Thailand) Ltd, a unit of Keystone Foods, and Cargill Thailand. Last year, Thailand supplied 62 percent of McDonald's Japan's chicken product imports, with China supplying the remainder.McDonald's Japan said earlier this week that it sourced about a fifth of its Chicken McNuggets from Shanghai Husi and had halted sales of the product on Monday.     The food scandal broke after a TV report on Sunday showed staff at Shanghai Husi Food using long expired meat and picking up food from the floor to add back to the mix.     The fast-food company said in Hong Kong it had also stopped selling its McSpicy chicken filets, chicken and green salads, fresh corn cups and iced lemon tea. McDonald's said it had stopped using the following ingredients from another branch, Guangzhou Husi: lettuce, corn kernels, lemon slices, green salad, cucumber, onion and tomato.""We reiterate that until today, all the food sold at McDonald's restaurants conform to the food safety standard under Hong Kong legal regulations,"" McDonald's said. The announcement came after Hong Kong said it had suspended all imports from Shanghai Husi Food, which is owned by Illinois-based OSI Group.  Hong Kong's Centre for Food Safety said in a statement late on Thursday that any food products from Husi already imported into the city would be marked, sealed and banned from sale, pending the results of investigations by Chinese authorities.China is McDonald's third-biggest market as measured by the number of restaurants.

119,"  (Adds McDonald's Japan shifting overseas sourcing of chicken products to Thailand from China)HONG KONG, July 25 McDonald's Corp has suspended sales of chicken nuggets and other items in Hong Kong after it said it imported products from Shanghai Husi Food, the U.S.-owned Chinese company at the centre of a food safety scare in China.McDonald's said it imported certain products from Shanghai Husi between July last year and June this year, although no food items from the Shanghai supplier remained in stock.In Japan, McDonald's Holdings Co (Japan) said on Friday it would halt all imports of chicken products from China and shift that business to Thailand, boosting purchases from existing suppliers McKey Foods Services (Thailand) Ltd, a unit of Keystone Foods, and Cargill Thailand.Last year, Thailand supplied 62 percent of McDonald's Japan's chicken product imports, with China supplying the remainder.McDonald's Japan said earlier this week that it sourced about a fifth of its Chicken McNuggets from Shanghai Husi and had halted sales of the product on Monday. The food scandal broke after a TV report on Sunday showed staff at Shanghai Husi Food using long expired meat and picking up food from the floor to add back to the mix.The fast-food company said in Hong Kong it had also stopped selling its McSpicy chicken filets, chicken and green salads, fresh corn cups and iced lemon tea. McDonald's said it had stopped using the following ingredients from another branch, Guangzhou Husi: lettuce, corn kernels, lemon slices, green salad, cucumber, onion and tomato. ""We reiterate that until today, all the food sold at McDonald's restaurants conform to the food safety standard under Hong Kong legal regulations,"" McDonald's said.The announcement came after Hong Kong said it had suspended all imports from Shanghai Husi Food, which is owned by Illinois-based OSI Group.Hong Kong's Centre for Food Safety said in a statement late on Thursday that any food products from Husi already imported into the city would be marked, sealed and banned from sale, pending the results of investigations by Chinese authorities. China is McDonald's third-biggest market as measured by the number of restaurants.The latest food safety scare in China has also ensnared KFC parent Yum Brands Inc, which has required all its KFC and Pizza Hut restaurants to seal up and stop using all meat materials supplied by the Husi factory.There have been no reports of any consumers falling sick in the latest food scare.Food safety is one of the top issues for Chinese consumers after a scandal in 2008 where dairy products tainted with the industrial chemical melamine led to the deaths of six infants and made many thousands sick.

McDonald's said in a statement it had not received any  complaint from the agency and had no information about the lawsuit. It said its food was produced according to methods approved by Russian authorities. The lawsuit comes three months after the fast-food chain  decided to close its restaurants in Crimea, the Ukraine region whose annexation by Russia in March triggered U.S. and European sanctions. At the time, some Russian politicians called for all McDonald's outlets in Russia to be shut.The court will hold a preliminary hearing on Aug. 13 with the key hearing likely to be scheduled for September, she said.

122,"  * Issues at unit ""absolutely inconsistent"" with OSI values* China ops to come under direct control of U.S. headquarters* OSI to set up quality control centre; launch education campaign* McDonald's drops some meat items, draws on supplier network   (Adds comments from OSI executives, details)By Samuel Shen and Kazunori TakadaSHANGHAI, July 28 A leading U.S. meat supplier said on Monday that a Chinese unit at the centre of a food safety scandal had issues that were ""absolutely inconsistent"" with the group's high standards.""This is my company and events like these have a personal toll ... they simply don't represent the values I stand for or those of my company,"" Sheldon Lavin, the millionaire chairman, CEO and owner of Illinois-based OSI Group LLC told a news conference in Shanghai.OSI said it was suspending operations at Shanghai Husi Food and would review all its China plants in a bid to limit further damage after losing two major customers.KFC and Pizza Hut parent Yum Brands Inc last week severed its ties with OSI, while the Japan and Hong Kong units of McDonald's Corp said they were ending their relationship with the U.S. meat processor's Chinese unit following allegations it mixed expired meat with fresh produce. David McDonald, OSI's president and chief operating officer, said the group was making senior management changes in China, and will set up a quality control centre in Shanghai to better supervise its business. It will also bring in global experts to survey the China operations and improve auditing, including constant visual surveillance and extensive employee interviews.In addition, it plans to spend 10 million yuan ($1.62 million) on a food safety education programme in Shanghai.OSI, which ranks among the top few dozen U.S. private companies with annual revenue of close to $6 billion, said its China operations had a certain amount of autonomy as the group wanted a decentralised business model that allowed decisions to be made locally, although global standards were not meant to be broken. McDonald said the China operations would come under the direct control of headquarters.Shanghai Husi Food was accused earlier this month by a TV documentary of mixing expired meat with fresh produce and forging production dates. Regulators in Shanghai said Husi had forged the dates on smoked beef patties and then sold them after they expired. Police have detained five people as part of their investigation. There have been no reports of any consumers falling sick. ""To date, we've found issues that are absolutely inconsistent with our internal requirements for the highest standards, processes and policies,"" McDonald told a packed news conference at a Shanghai hotel, adding all nine OSI food processing plants in China would be reviewed. DAMAGING SCANDALS China is McDonald's third biggest market by outlets and Yum's largest and is a big growth opportunity for foreign fast-food chains. But a series of damaging food safety scandals in recent years risks denting those prospects as many Chinese look to foreign restaurants for better quality.McDonald's, which has more than 2,000 outlets in mainland China, took more meat dishes off its menus on Monday as it sought to fill the supply gap after OSI withdrew all Shanghai Husi products from the market at the weekend.At least three McDonald's outlets in Shanghai and Beijing, visited by Reuters reporters on Monday, had stopped selling all or most of their meat products. Outlets in cities such as Tianjin and Wuhan were also hit, according to microblog postings.A spokeswoman at McDonald's in China said its beef, chicken and pork products were affected at outlets across the country, though the level of impact varied. In an emailed statement, McDonald's said it had withdrawn all products from the Husi group in China since Friday. ""As a result, we are now only offering a limited menu in our restaurants around the country.""The company said some of its China restaurants would resume offering a full menu in early August, while others may take a little longer.""I wanted to order chicken products today,"" said Tan Qiang, 23, at a McDonald's in central Shanghai. ""But they only had one type of combo and nothing else. I was disappointed not being able to eat what I want.""

124,"   By Dan Levine | July 29  July 29 McDonald's Corp, not just its franchisees, can be held liable in complaints that the company violated employee rights, an official at the U.S. National Labor Relations Board said in a letter made public on Tuesday.NLRB general counsel Richard Griffin Jr. wrote in the letter that of the 181 complaints filed against the fast-food chain  since November 2012 in connection with employee protests, 43 had merit. McDonald's will be named as a joint respondent in those cases if they are not settled, Griffin wrote.Christine Owens, the executive director of the National Employment Law Project, an advocacy group for low-wage workers, said the McDonald's must be held accountable for its franchisees. The NLRB decision means corporations ""cannot feign ignorance or disclaim responsibility for franchisees' illegal acts, especially when those acts flow from the business model the lead company imposes,"" she said In a statement, McDonald's senior vice president of human resources, Heather Smedstad, said the NLRB decision was wrong and the company would contest it. McDonald's relationship with its franchisees does not establish a joint employer relationship, Smedstad said.The NLRB decision ""changes the rules for thousands of small businesses, and goes against decades of established law regarding the franchise model in the United States,"" Smedstad said. McDonald's, the world's biggest restaurant operator by revenue, has been at the center a national debate on pay inequality at a time when many middle- to low-income Americans are struggling to make ends meet.According to the NLRB letter, 68 complaints against McDonald's had no merit, and 64 are still under investigation.

127,"   By Dan Levine  McDonald's Corp, not just its franchisees, can be held liable in complaints that the company violated employee rights, an official at the U.S. National Labor Relations Board said in a letter made public on Tuesday.NLRB general counsel Richard Griffin Jr. wrote in the letter that of the 181 complaints filed against the fast-food chain  since November 2012 in connection with employee protests, 43 had merit. McDonald's will be named as a joint respondent in those cases if they are not settled, Griffin wrote.Christine Owens, the executive director of the National Employment Law Project, an advocacy group for low-wage workers, said the McDonald's must be held accountable for its franchisees. The NLRB decision means corporations ""cannot feign ignorance or disclaim responsibility for franchisees’ illegal acts, especially when those acts flow from the business model the lead company imposes,"" she saidIn a statement, McDonald's senior vice president of human resources, Heather Smedstad, said the NLRB decision was wrong and the company would contest it. McDonald's relationship with its franchisees does not establish a joint employer relationship, Smedstad said. The NLRB decision ""changes the rules for thousands of small businesses, and goes against decades of established law regarding the franchise model in the United States,"" Smedstad said.McDonald's, the world's biggest restaurant operator by revenue, has been at the center a national debate on pay inequality at a time when many middle- to low-income Americans are struggling to make ends meet. According to the NLRB letter, 68 complaints against McDonald's had no merit, and 64 are still under investigation.

128,"  (Repeats to add INSIGHT tag. No changes to text.)By Adam Jourdan and Clare BaldwinSHANGHAI/HONG KONG, July 30 When inspectors visited Shanghai Husi Food Co Ltd earlier this summer, the production line at the plant now at the centre of an international food scandal appeared in good order, with fresh meat being handled by properly-attired workers and supervisors keeping a watchful eye over the process.However, if they had arrived unannounced a day before, they would have found piles of blue plastic bags filled with out-of-date meat stacked around the factory floor, a worker at the facility told Reuters, adding the old meat was often added back into the mix to boost production and cut costs.""The next day, that meat just disappeared - someone must have disposed of it. The manager said it was an inspection,"" said the worker, who wasn't authorised to talk to the media and so didn't want to be named.On July 20, following an undercover local TV report that alleged workers used expired meat and doctored food production dates, regulators closed the factory, which is part of OSI Group LLC, a U.S. food supplier. Police have detained five people including Shanghai Husi's head and quality manager.The scandal - which has hit mainly big foreign fast-food brands including McDonald's Corp and Yum Brands Inc , which owns the KFC and Pizza Hut chains - underlines the challenges facing inspectors in China's fast-growing and sprawling food industry. China is Yum's biggest market and McDonald's third largest by outlets.Behind the thousands of brightly-lit restaurants offering what Chinese consumers see as better quality food lie supply chains that rely on an army of poorly regulated and inadequately audited processing plants. Yum has around 650 suppliers in China alone.China's government has struggled to restore confidence in its $1 trillion food processing industry since six infants died in 2008 after drinking adulterated milk. The head of China's Food and Drug Administration told the China Daily this week that the food safety situation ""remains severe"" and the existing oversight system ""is not effective.""China's food testing industry is expected to top 8 billion yuan ($1.29 billion) by next year, with more than 5,000 companies offering food inspection services. Regulators overseeing the industry are thinly stretched, company executives say.Laws on food safety are incomplete and responsibility in enforcing them is unclear, making it difficult for regulators to do their jobs, Gao Guan, deputy secretary-general of the China Meat Association, told Reuters. ""In developed countries people obey the traffic rules. You wait when the light is red and you walk when the light is green. But this is not the case in China. People walk when other people walk and no one cares about the light. So in this particular environment things like Husi are very hard to avoid,"" Gao said.BEST PICTURE OSI, ranked by Forbes at 62nd on its list of U.S. private companies with annual revenue of close to $6 billion, said this week it suspended operations at Shanghai Husi Food and would review all its China plants, which would now come under direct control of its headquarters in Illinois. It said it would ""assign a vigilant rotation of global experts to continuously survey these operations and implement exhaustive audit steps,"" including constant visual surveillance of production measures and document compliance. The Shanghai Husi scandal exposes weaknesses in big foreign brands' ability to police their own supply chains and processing plants - whether in-house or through third-party auditors.""The issue with quality control audits is that the factories usually know about it and get ready,"" said Max Henry, Shanghai-based executive director of the Global Supply Chain Council.Driven by extreme price pressures and an ambivalent workforce, suppliers often try to hide dubious practices from inspectors, showing them only certain parts of a factory or taking them to ""fake"" plants, so reports rarely give a full picture of compliance, auditors told Reuters.""They want to give the customer the best picture of the factory, so when something's going wrong, they have to hide it,"" said Evelyne Mazaleyrat, product manager, food service for food auditor Bureau Veritas in Asia.Audits of the Shanghai Husi factory by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) in 2004 and 2010 to clear the way for potential Chinese poultry exports to the United States, gave the facility a clean bill of health. However, links to USDA audit forms show a one-page ""checklist"" format that some food safety experts have criticized. ""BANKRUPT SYSTEM"" To be sure, gaps in the auditing process are not limited to China.""It's a bankrupt system,"" said Mansour Samadpour, microbiologist and CEO of IEH Laboratories & Consulting Group in Seattle, noting audits are normally scheduled ahead of time and organised around publicly available questionnaires.

129,"   By Lisa Baertlein  A food safety scare in China is testing local consumers' loyalty to foreign fast-food brands, including McDonald's Corp and Yum Brands Inc, which owns the KFC and Pizza Hut chains.Yum said on Wednesday that the scare, triggered by a TV report earlier this month showing improper meat handling by a supplier, Shanghai Husi Food, caused ""significant, negative"" damage to sales at KFC and Pizza Hut restaurants over the past 10 days. ""If the significant sales impact is sustained, it will have a material effect on full-year earnings per share,"" Yum said in a regulatory filing. Shares in Yum, which counts China as its No. 1 market, tumbled nearly 7 percent on Thursday. At least three brokerages cut their profit estimates for Yum for 2014 and 2015.RBC analysts said Yum's China sales could be hurt 10-15 percent for 6-8 weeks, and cut their price target to $85 from $94.  UBS analysts said the initial consumer response was worse than feared, and the company should reinstate reporting monthly figures to reduce uncertainty.    Officials from McDonald's in China and Hong Kong have not responded to requests for information on the impact on sales from the scandal, but McDonald's Holdings Co (Japan) Ltd on Tuesday scrapped its full-year earnings guidance after the China scare forced it to switch to alternative chicken supplies. A McDonald's Japan executive said sales had dropped 15-20 percent on a daily basis due to the scare. Both McDonald's and Yum are looking to China - where consumers see foreign brands as offering better food quality - for long-term growth given the size of its population, growing middle class and rapid economic growth.    ""Both of these stocks are banking heavily on China for their future growth,"" said Richard Brubaker, an adjunct professor at the China Europe International Business School and founder of the Collective Responsibility consultancy. ""For Yum, this is a problem because it has a history of problems in China. For McDonald's, it's the sheer size of the problem and the inability to get product."" CONSUMER CAUTION    Yum, which has nearly 6,400 restaurants in China, had just begun to see its restaurant sales there recovering from a slide last year due to an avian food outbreak and a previous food safety scare. Yum has cut its global ties with OSI Group LLC [OSIGP.UL], the U.S. parent of Shanghai Husi Food. Yum said OSI was not a major supplier and the move had ""minimal disruption"" to the availability of menu offerings in China.    McDonald's, which has more than 2,000 restaurants in China, has had a long relationship with OSI and was more dependent on the supplier than Yum. Many McDonald's China outlets have been hit by meat shortages since the company ended its relationship with OSI there.    Around two-thirds of the more than five dozen consumers Reuters reporters spoke to in Shanghai, Beijing and Hong Kong on Thursday said they would scale back their visits to McDonald's, at least for now.    ""For people like us, McDonald's and KFC are places to meet friends,"" said Yao Nanfang, a 16-year-old student in a shopping mall in central Shanghai. ""We'll still go to McDonald's, but we'll order fewer meat products.""    Diners in Hong Kong also said they were likely to eat less frequently at McDonald's, but noted that the chain's low prices made it hard to give up.     ""I come to McDonald's less often now, but I won't completely stop coming because it's so much cheaper than other restaurants,"" said Nan Tang, who says he eats at McDonald's twice a week.    In Hong Kong, McDonald's has ended a promotion of its chicken McSpicy burger and shifted a membership program away from offering discounts on McNuggets, which it is not currently selling.     Following the TV report that alleged workers at Shanghai Husi Food used expired meat and doctored food production dates, regulators closed the plant on July 20.

131,"  (The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.)By Mark LeonardJuly 31 As the European Union and the United States ramp up their sanctions on Russia, President Vladimir Putin's plans for retaliation seem to include an attack on McDonald's. There could not be a more powerful symbol that geopolitics is increasingly undoing the globalization of the world economy.The burger chain was celebrated in the 1990s by the journalist Thomas Friedman's ""Golden Arches theory of conflict prevention,"" which argued that the spread of McDonald's around the world would bring an end to war. But almost 25 years after a McDonald's restaurant opened in Moscow, it seems that deep interdependence has not ended conflict between great powers - it has merely provided a new battlefield for it.As in any relationship that turns sour, many of the things that initially tie the parties together are now being used to drive them apart. For the past two decades we have heard that the world is becoming a global village because of the breadth and depth of its trading and investment links, its nascent global governance and the networks of the information age. But those forces for interdependence are degenerating into their opposite; we could call it the three faces of 'splinterdependence': From free trade to economic warfare: Economic interdependence was supposed to defuse geopolitical tensions over time - or at least allow the two to be compartmentalized. But today the West is using Russia's participation in the global economy to punish it for its actions in eastern Ukraine. The EU has announced sanctions that will hit Russia in the banking, oil and defense industries. When China felt its interests were threatened, it was also willing to use economic sanctions in its territorial disputes with the Philippines and Japan. In May, Beijing found itself on the receiving end as Vietnam turned a blind eye to anti-Chinese riots targeting Chinese plants when China put an oil rig in the disputed Paracel Islands.From global governance to competitive multilateralism: Many saw global trade relations as a prelude to global government, with rising powers such as Russia and China being socialized into roles as ""responsible stakeholders"" in a single global system. But multilateral integration now seems to be dividing rather than uniting. Geopolitical competition gridlocks global institutions; the Ukraine crisis came about because of a clash between two incompatible projects of multilateral integration - the European-led Eastern Partnership and Russia's Eurasian Union. There is a global trend of competing mini-lateral friendship organizations. On the one hand, the ""world without the West"" encompasses the BRICs (Brazil, Russia, India and China), the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and a host of sub-regional bodies. On the other, the West is creating new groupings outside the universal institutions - such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership in Asia and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership - that deliberately exclude China and Russia. Rather than seeing international law as a way of de-escalating disputes between countries, people are increasingly talking about its use as a weapon against hostile countries - ""lawfare.""From one Internet to many: Even the Internet is leading to hostile fragmentation rather than a global public square. Putin might have offered Edward Snowden refuge, but it is America's closest allies - such as Angela Merkel in Germany and President Dilma Rousseff in Brazil - who are the most concerned about the National Security Agency's prying into their citizens private lives. Anupam Chander and Uyen P. Le of the University of California at Davis contend that ""Anxieties over surveillance  are justifying governmental measures that break apart the World Wide Web  the era of a global Internet may be passing."" They claim that countries such as Australia, France, South Korea, India, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Malaysia and Vietnam have already moved to keep certain types of data on servers within their national borders. After the end of the Cold War, when the apostles of globalization argued that trade would soon eclipse warfare, the military strategist Edward Luttwak predicted that they would soon be proved wrong. Although capital would replace firepower as a weapon of choice, and market penetration would play the role that bases and garrisons had in earlier generations, the driving force of international relations would be conflict rather than trade. As he put it, we would have ""the grammar of commerce but the logic of war."" Luttwak's prediction seemed misplaced at a time when countries such as Russia, China, India and Brazil were rushing to join the global economy.The post-Cold War world these countries entered was marked by the development of an U.S.-led unipolar security order and a European-led legal order that sought to bind the world together through free trade, economic interdependence, international law and multilateral institutions. Today, we can see that the U.S.-led security order is fraying both as a result of war-weariness and the emergence of new powers internationally. As a result, great powers such as the United States are increasingly trying to weaponize the international legal order through sanctions to compensate for their unwillingness to use military force.Interdependence, formerly an economic boon, has now become a threat as well. No one is willing to lose out on the benefits of a global economy, but all great powers are thinking about how to protect themselves from its risks, military and otherwise. China is moving toward domestic consumption after the threat of the U.S. financial crisis. America is moving toward energy independence after the Iraq War. Russia is trying to build a Eurasian Union after the euro crisis. And even internationalist Germany is trying to change the EU so that its fellow member states are bound into German-style policies.In the years after the Cold War, interdependence was a force for ending conflict.  But in 2014, it is creating it. After 25 years of being bound together ever more tightly, the world seems intent on resegregating itself.

132,"   By Lisa Baertlein  McDonald's Corp CEO Don Thompson sure could use a break.The head of the world's biggest restaurant chain, who for much of his two years at the helm has been battling to spark  sales growth in the United States and Europe, got battered by headline-grabbing bad news in late July.In the final days of the month, its China business was hit with a food-safety scare involving a key supplier; the chain got ensnared in the West's sanctions standoff with Russia; burger flippers at U.S. restaurants claimed an incremental win from the National Labor Relations Board in their fight to hold McDonald's responsible for the actions of franchisees; and, a Texas jury slapped the company with a $27 million verdict. Add to all that its results showed second-quarter profit dropped more than expected.""They're under siege on three continents,"" said Howard Penney, restaurant analyst at Hedgeye Risk Management, an investment research firm.To be sure, the company's famous name and the ubiquity of its restaurants worldwide help to fuel the media storm, said Penney: ""McDonald's is a pawn in many instances around the world. It's an easy target."" Such upheavals are not uncommon for McDonald's and other global power houses, including Coca-Cola Co and Wal-Mart Stores Inc, experts said, though perhaps not quite so many in such a short period. In a statement a McDonald's spokeswoman said: ""In the last few weeks, we’ve seen issues in various parts of the world which directly or indirectly affect our brand and others. We have 35,000 McDonald’s restaurants in 120 countries, and skilled professional communications teams in every area of the world.""She said that dealing with a 24/7 news cycle around the world is par for the course, and the communications teams address such issues so that the company can keep its focus on serving customers.Thompson was not made available for comment.DEFAULT BRAND  Analysts and investors said the latest, largely external events appear to pose manageable risk to McDonald's profits, but they are a headache at a time when the company is grappling with intense competition, shifting consumer tastes and service slow-downs stemming from the menu additions of everything from salads and wraps to lattes and smoothies aimed at broadening its audience and boosting sales. Branding expert Robert Passikoff, said McDonald’s needs to find a way to stand out from the crowd.""McDonald's has reached the point where it's become a default brand. It's there. That's it,"" said Passikoff, president of Brand Keys.Shares in McDonald's are up less than 7 percent since Thompson took the helm on July 1, 2012, lagging the S&P 500's gain of nearly 42 percent in that period.    Investors, analysts and franchisees are clamoring for the company to stop trying to be ""all things to all people"". They want it to simplify its unwieldy menu and point to the success of rivals like Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc and In-N-Out Burger, which have won passionate fans by selling just a few items.McDonald's was caught up in the latest China food safety scare after a July 20 television expose showed workers allegedly mishandling meat at Shanghai Husi Food Co Ltd, a factory owned by OSI Group LLC, a major supplier to the chain. When the story broke, McDonald's China business had been rebounding from the double whammy of a food safety scare and a bird flu outbreak that crushed sales in 2013.  McDonald's roughly 2,000 restaurants in China suffered meat shortages after it ended its relationship with OSI China.    Executives from the chain's long-struggling Japanese unit, McDonald's Holdings Co Ltd, who were forced to find alternate chicken McNugget supplies, said the scare sent sales down as much as 20 percent.RUSSIA CONCERN Seattle-based portfolio manager Bill Smead, whose firm Smead Capital Management holds nearly 516,000 shares in McDonald's, took news of the China food scandal in stride.""We assume that something is going to go amazingly haywire with companies in China,"" said Smead, who added that he has ceased adding to McDonald’s holdings while the company works through its “tribulation” period.  About 15 percent of McDonald's operating profit comes from the Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa unit that includes China and Japan, said Bernstein Research analyst Sara Senatore. The bigger concern, she said, are McDonald's troubles in Russia, where the company has about 400 restaurants. Against the backdrop of the political tussle over U.S. sanctions imposed on Russia because of Moscow's intervention in Ukraine, Russia's chief sanitary inspector Anna Popova on July 25 accused the company of violations ""which put the product quality and safety of the entire McDonald's chain in doubt.""Europe contributes about 35 percent of McDonald's operating profit. The company does not break out country-specific contributions, but Russia ""up until recently had been one of the stronger markets for them in Europe,"" Senatore said.Meanwhile at home, the troubles also piled on. McDonald's workers' union-backed fight for better wages and working conditions scored points when the general counsel for the U.S. National Labor Relations Board said in a letter made public on July 29 that McDonald's, not just its franchisees, can be held liable in complaints that the company violated employee rights.David Hess, associate professor of business law at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business, said the NLRB attorney's finding is just an early step in what is usually a long process.As for the $27 million jury verdict awarded to family members of two teenagers who died following a beating in a McDonald's restaurant in Texas, legal experts said that is expected to fail on appeal.McDonald's executives have promised to boost sales over the next 12 to 18 months by doing things like focusing on value, digital advertising and the quality of its food. As for Thompson, Penney predicted that he will survive the current crises and gets more time to fix the longer-term problems, at least into 2015. ""I don't think he's going anywhere. It's too soon,"" he said.

133,"  BEIJING Police in China have detained six executives of a meat supply company at the center of the latest food safety scare to hit the country, state media reported on Sunday.Shanghai's chief of police and deputy mayor Bai Shaokang told local radio that the executives of Shanghai Husi Food, a unit of U.S.-based OSI Group LLC, had been taken into custody,  Xinhua news agency said.The firm had supplied meat to foreign fast food chains McDonald's and KFC-parent Yum Brands Inc, among many others.The scandal, which also dragged in coffee chain Starbucks Corp.O>, was triggered by a local television report showing staff at Shanghai Husi using long-expired meat. The report also alleged the firm forged production dates.Food safety has been a huge concern for Chinese consumers after dairy products tainted with the industrial chemical melamine sickened many thousands and led to the deaths of six infants in 2008. Regulators closed the Shanghai Husi plant on July 20. Police have detained five people, including Shanghai Husi's head and quality manager. It was not clear from the Xinhua report if Bai was referring to the same executives.“If any wrongdoing was unearthed, we would deal with it strictly according to law,” Bai was quoted as saying. Yum Brands Inc is the biggest Western restaurant operator in China with 6,400 restaurants. It warned last week that the scare caused ""significant, negative"" damage to sales at KFC and Pizza Hut restaurants in the period from July 20 through July 30.After the scandal broke, Yum quickly cut all ties with OSI,    which was not a significant supplier to the chain.

The world's biggest restaurant chain will resume full menus in Beijing and Guangzhou this week, while menus in Shanghai will return to normal this month, a company spokeswoman in China told Reuters on Monday. She said some other cities had also resumed full menus, but declined to give more details. McDonald's last month cut ties with Shanghai Husi Food, a unit of U.S.-based OSI Group LLC, after a television report triggered investigations into improper meat-handling procedures at Shanghai Husi's factory.

China is Yum Brands Inc's (YUM.N) biggest market and McDonald's third-largest by outlets. The resumption process is taking longer than expected, the McDonald's spokeswoman said.  ""We will go back to the origin of the food, where the food comes from, so it will take a longer time and is not as easy as people may think.

""The restrictions were imposed on products that Russia can produce itself or is less dependent on banned countries,"" van den Bos said, adding that in these categories, Russia imports a lot from Latin America and Asia. ""Having said that, these sanctions put pressure on local producers as well as other trade partners as Russia has to look elsewhere for substitution, which in turn is likely to push up prices for Russian consumers if government does not step in,"" she added. Russia's domestic food industry has grown significantly in recent years, boosted by earlier bans on U.S. meat imports over safety concerns and investment by foreign companies.""We're committed to developing local suppliers,"" said a spokesman for Mondelez International.

A Shandong meat unit in which China's state-backed COFCO Corp owns shares supplies both Yum and Burger King, the lists showed. Benjamin Cavender, Shanghai-based analyst at China Market Research Group, said food chains are generally reluctant to publish supplier lists as they don't want competitors to know where they source their materials.""In this case it's probably smart for the companies to do this because they want to send a clear message that they are being transparent both to the government and to their consumers,"" he said.

146,"  SHANGHAI Aug 11 Five fast food chains including McDonald's and Yum Brands Inc have published details of their suppliers on their Chinese websites, following a request from Shanghai authorities after the latest food safety scare.Shanghai's Municipal Food and Drug Administration said on Saturday that it had asked the two chains, along with Burger King, Dicos and Carl's Jr, to publish the usually closely-guarded information as part of efforts to strengthen oversight of food suppliers. The five firms were among a range of companies that were supplied meat by Shanghai Husi Food, a unit of U.S.-based OSI Group LLC, which was alleged by a TV report to have improperly handled meat and used expired food. The Shanghai authority said the companies published the information on Aug. 9.

147,"   By Solarina Ho | TORONTO  TORONTO Canadian coffee and donut chain Tim Hortons, which has offered only one coffee blend in its 50-year history, hopes to lure new coffee drinkers and fend off rivals such as Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) and McDonald's Corp (MCD.N) with the launch throughout North America of its new dark roast blend.Tim Hortons, which announced the move on Thursday, may also increase prices to tackle rising costs and competition from U.S. rivals expanding in Canada.""Looking at the coffee market, I would suggest that, given the degree of cost increases, that we are looking at prices going up sometime in 2015,"" Tim Hortons Inc THI.TO chief executive Marc Caira said on Thursday.Tim Hortons, which says it serves nearly 8 out of every 10 cups of coffee sold in Canada, outlined a plan in February to kick-start growth and improve returns by fine-tuning its menu to encourage more spending, improving service and opening new restaurant formats.Last week, the chain reported market-beating quarterly growth that showed its strategy, which includes higher priced and new menu items, is paying off. Still, traffic declined for the ninth consecutive quarter in Canada and is flat in the United States. Caira expects the new dark brew, which will also be available for home brewing in formats such as Keurig Mountain Inc's single serve pod, to contribute to results, but he declined to give details. The alternative brew was first sold late last fall in Columbus, Ohio and London, Ontario, and then in the province of Quebec in June. It will be offered at all 4,496 restaurants across Canada and the United States starting Friday.""There's about 38 to 40 percent of coffee drinkers that are looking for a darker roast,"" said Caira. ""Those are very intriguing numbers for us ... If we weren't pleased with the (initial) numbers, we wouldn't be launching it."" INFLATION PRESSURE Caira, a former top Nestle SA executive who took over at the Canadian chain a little more than a year ago, plans to tackle inflationary pressure from higher coffee bean prices and labor costs by cutting waste and improving efficiencies.""The last thing that we want to do is arbitrarily increase prices,"" said Caira, but he conceded the chain will likely raise prices in 2015. He could not say what products might be affected. Caira said the company was also working with Ottawa to address labor shortages in some parts of Canada following tighter rules on hiring temporary foreign workers in the restaurant industry. ""There must be flexibility in the system to address labor issues in certain parts of the country,"" Caira said.He added that in some markets there are not enough people to work in the company's restaurants.""That is a fact proven out by number,"" he said. ""In those cases, there's a need for this program."" (Additional reporting by Euan Rocha.

154,"   By Polina Devitt and Alissa de Carbonnel | MOSCOW Russia  MOSCOW Russia Russia said on Thursday it was investigating dozens of McDonald's (MCD.N) restaurants, in what many businessmen said was retaliation for Western sanctions over Ukraine they fear could spread to other symbols of Western capitalism.Russia's food safety watchdog said it was looking at possible breaches of sanitary rules at McDonald's, but many in the business community said it was a reflection of the deterioration in relations between Russia and the West over Ukraine, where pro-Russian separatists in the east of the country are fighting against government forces.""Obviously, it's driven by the political issues surrounding Ukraine,"" said Alexis Rodzianko, President and CEO of the American Chamber of Commerce in Russia.""The question on my mind is: Is this going to be a knock on the door, or is this going to be the beginning of a campaign?""Russia earlier this month slapped bans on Western food imports after Washington and Brussels imposed economic sanctions in response to Moscow's annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region and its backing of the separatists.In a sign of growing frustration at the threat to trade, several mid-tier Russian businessmen signed off on a letter by British entrepreneur Richard Branson calling on politicians to stop the conflict.""We, as business leaders from Russia, Ukraine and the rest of the world, urge our governments to work together to ensure we do not regress into the Cold War misery of the past,"" the letter said.McDonald's, which opened its first store in Russia in the dying days of the Soviet Union in 1990, is a very visible symbol of American capitalism in Russia, where it now has 438 branches. The food safety watchdog ordered the closure of four of its restaurants in Moscow on Wednesday, including that first Russian branch, which is the busiest in the firm's global network.The watchdog said on Thursday it was starting unscheduled checks in several Russian regions, including Sverdlovsk and Tatarstan in the Urals, the central Voronezh region and the region around the capital.""We are aware of what is going on. We have always been and are now open to any checks,"" a McDonald's Russia spokeswoman said.VULNERABLE BUSINESSES So far no other prominent Western brand has reported coming under extra scrutiny from the Russian authorities, though there were Russian media reports that Jack Daniels was being investigated. The whiskey producer said it would challenge any accusations about its quality. Amrest, the Warsaw-listed holder of the Russian franchises for several other iconic U.S. brands -- Starbucks, KFC, Pizza Hut and Burger King -- said last week it had experienced no problems and was doing well.""We are monitoring closely recent geopolitical developments, to make sure we can adapt to changing conditions and minimise business risks,"" said AmRest's chairman Henry McGovern during a teleconference with investors last week.Nevertheless, big foreign brands are viewed as vulnerable.French bank Societe Generale published on Thursday a research note saying companies generating most revenues in Russia and therefore most exposed to political risks were BP (BP.L), British American Tobacco (BATS.L), BASF (BASFn.DE), Carlsberg (CARLb.CO), Coca-Cola (KO.N), Alstom (ALSO.PA) and E.ON (EONGn.DE). Even some of McDonald's rivals came to its defence.""This is a major blow to relations between the two countries,"" Mikhail Goncharov, the owner of Russian fast-food chain Teremok, told RBC Daily, a newspaper.""Even the Soviet Union was maintaining those relations because the first McDonald's opened during the USSR times, and PepsiCo (PEP.N) factories continued to function regardless of political crises,"" he added.Since McDonald's first broke into Russia, it has for many Russian consumers been overshadowed by hundreds of swanky French and Japanese restaurants in the Russian capital, but it remains a powerful symbol, and therefore a prominent target.On Thursday, outside the shuttered restaurant on Moscow's Pushkin Square, the closure stirred patriotic sentiment among some people.""They occasionally kick us with different sanctions. Why can't we do something in return? Moreover, McDonald's is such a symbol of everything Western, I think it is a good symbolic step that shows that we have some teeth,"" said Ivan.

155,"  BEIJING China tried five members of a banned religious group on Thursday for the murder of a woman who was beaten to death at a McDonald's restaurant after she refused to give them her telephone number when they apparently tried to recruit her.China has sentenced dozens of followers of Quannengshen, or the Church of Almighty God, since the murder of the woman in May in the eastern province of Shandong.One man and four women were charged with murder and with illegal cult activities, according to the court in Shandong's Yantai city.The court's official microblog carried pictures of the five, dressed in orange jackets identifying them as the accused, with about a dozen policemen standing behind them.""The facts are clear and there is plenty of evidence,"" Gao Cheng, the lawyer for the murdered woman's family, was quoted as saying by the People's Daily on its website.The accused had shown no sign of repentance and so should be severely punished, Gao said.The court said the accused were allowed to defend themselves, but gave no details.  The trial, lasting just a single day as is common in China, ended by late afternoon with the court saying a verdict would be announced at a later date.Chinese authorities have arrested nearly 1,000 members of Quannengshen, state media said this week, the latest in a series of official moves against the group.Li Ming, online editor for the state-backed China Anti-Cult Association, told the Sina news portal that China had at least 20 such cults, who had ""coerced"" millions of people. ""Once you have been brain-washed it's very hard to get out. Because you have utter belief,"" Li said.The Quannengshen group, which originated in central Henan province, believes that Jesus was resurrected as Yang Xiangbin, wife of the sect's founder, Zhao Weishan, according to the official Xinhua news agency.Zhao is also known as Xu Wenshan, Xinhua said, adding that the couple fled to the United States in September 2000. In 2012, China launched a crackdown on the group after it called for a ""decisive battle"" to slay the ""Red Dragon"" Communist Party, and preached that the world would end that year.The party brooks no challenge to its rule and is obsessed with social stability. It has cracked down on cults, which have multiplied in recent years. Demonstrations have been put down with force and some sect leaders executed.Former President Jiang Zemin launched a campaign in 1999 to crush the Falun Gong religious group, banning it as an ""evil cult"" after thousands of practitioners staged a surprise but peaceful sit-in outside the leadership compound in Beijing to demand official recognition of their movement.

The food safety agency cited breaches of sanitary rules by restaurants in the fast food chain, but the action came after Moscow and the West imposed tit-for-tat sanctions over the conflict in Ukraine. The agency denied that its actions were politically motivated.""There are complaints about the quality and safety of the products in fast food restaurant chain McDonald's,"" said the regulatory agency, known in Russian as Rospotrebnadzor. It declined to comment on the scope of the planned checks.The regulator said on Thursday it is already conducting checks at McDonald's outlets in the Ural mountains region of Sverdlovsk, the Volga region of Tatarstan, the central Voronezh region and the Moscow region. It also plans checks in the republic of Bashkortostan and the southern Krasnodar region. Some of the checks are unscheduled.Natalya Lukyantseva, an official of the regulator's branch in the Sverdlovsk region, said checks had been started because of complaints from customers.""We are aware of what is going on. We have always been and are now open to any checks,"" McDonald's Russian spokeswoman said. She could not comment on the reasons for the checks. On Wednesday, the agency ordered the suspension of operations at four McDonald's restaurants in Moscow over what it said were ""numerous"" sanitary law breaches.The shuttered restaurants include one on Moscow's Pushkin Square, which McDonald's says is the busiest in its global network of restaurants. For a generation of Russians who saw the first McDonald's open in the dying days of the Soviet Union in 1990, the restaurants were a symbol of American capitalism. For most Muscovites now, they are just a part of the urban landscape.McDonald's operates 438 restaurants in Russia and considers the country one of its top seven major markets outside the United States and Canada, according to its 2013 annual report.Last month, Rospotrebnadzor's branch in the Novgorod region opened a court case against McDonald's as a result of the June inspections of its restaurants.It said at the time that McDonald's was deceiving consumers about the energy value of its burgers and about nutritional value of its desserts, and that its vegetable salad were contaminated with harmful bacteria.

162,"   By Lisa Baertlein  McDonald's Corp is replacing its U.S. president for the second time in two years, a move that suggests increased pressure on Chief Executive Don Thompson to improve sales in the fast food chain's home market.The company on Friday named former McDonald's executive Mike Andres as president of McDonald's USA, replacing Jeff Stratton, who had been in the job since December 2012. McDonald's said Stratton, 58, is retiring. Since last November, the world's biggest fast-food chain by revenue has suffered flat or declining monthly sales at its established U.S. stores. Among other things, analysts blame bloated menus for slower service, and said pressure has intensified from resurgent rivals such as Wendy's Co and Burger King Worldwide Inc.""It's hard to argue that this type of turnover doesn't put more scrutiny on a CEO,"" Bernstein Research analyst Sara Senatore said of the U.S. management change. ""If results stay weak despite turnover in these executive roles, then ultimately it's the responsibility of the CEO.""Thompson, who became president and CEO in July 2012, has presided over a period of disappointing results from the U.S. region due in part to internal missteps, brutal competition and cautious spending by the lower-income consumers that frequent the chain. In selecting Andres, who currently is the CEO of Nashville-based Logan's Roadhouse, McDonald's took the ""rare"" step of choosing an outside executive to lead the U.S. business, said Hedgeye Risk Management analyst Howard Penney. Stratton was McDonald's chief restaurant officer prior to being named president of the U.S. division. ""They're desperate,"" said Penney, who is among Wall Street's most bearish restaurant analysts.Still, Penney said Thompson likely has until the end of 2015 to show improvement in the business because some issues are seen by investors to be beyond his control, such as the U.S. economy and Russia, which shut some of McDonald's branches in Moscow this week. The Moscow closures were widely viewed as retaliation for Western sanctions against Russia Franchisees, investors and analysts have urged McDonald's to simplify its menus to better compete with the likes of In-N-Out Burger and Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc.Thompson has promised to get back to basics at McDonald's USA. At the same time, he is introducing new kitchen equipment that will allow diners to customize their hamburgers and sandwiches, a strategy that has fallen flat with critics. Andres, 56, will take over on Oct. 15. He rejoins McDonald's after serving as chairman and CEO of Logan's Roadhouse, a chain with 261 full-service restaurants in 23 states.

The court rulings confirmed that decision. Rospotrebnadzor has introduced sweeping checks, including unscheduled inspections, at McDonald's restaurants across the country. On Wednesday it ordered the temporary closure of a fourth branch in the capital - the sixth nationwide.Russian businessmen have said the crackdown is linked to the crisis over Ukraine, which has soured U.S.-Russian relations and led to a round of sanctions and trade restrictions. Rospotrebnadzor has denied that its actions are politically motivated.  McDonald's said it would appeal the court rulings, which ordered the three Moscow branches to be closed for 90 days.

We will continue to take care of our employees and do everything we can to continue successful operations in Russia,"" said a spokeswoman for the U.S. firm in Russia.

179,"  * Courts back food safety regulator's decision on closures* McDonald's says rulings unjustified, will appeal* Closures comes amid Russia-West tensions over Ukraine* Regulator suspends work at a fourth Moscow branch   (Adds closure of one more restaurant in Moscow, details)MOSCOW, Aug 27 Russian courts on Wednesday backed the temporary closure of three McDonald's  restaurants in Moscow for breaches of sanitary rules, amid a standoff with the West over Ukraine, while the state food safety watchdog suspended work at a fourth.The three restaurants - on Moscow's Manezh square, under the walls of the Kremlin, at Pushkin Square and on Prospect Mira - have been closed since last week on the orders of the watchdog, Rospotrebnadzor. The court rulings confirmed that decision. Rospotrebnadzor has introduced sweeping checks, including unscheduled inspections, at McDonald's restaurants across the country.On Wednesday it ordered the temporary closure of a fourth branch in the capital - the sixth nationwide. Russian businessmen have said the crackdown is linked to the crisis over Ukraine, which has soured U.S.-Russian relations and led to a round of sanctions and trade restrictions. Rospotrebnadzor has denied that its actions are politically motivated.McDonald's said it would appeal the court rulings, which ordered the three Moscow branches to be closed for 90 days.""We do not agree with the courts' decisions and will appeal them according to established procedures. We will continue to take care of our employees and do everything we can to continue successful operations in Russia,"" said a spokeswoman for the U.S. firm in Russia. A lawyer representing McDonald's in the court, Maksim Titarenko, was also quoted as saying the courts' decisions to close the branches were unjustified.""The court has ordered the maximum penalty under this article of the administrative offences code although there are no grounds for it,"" Interfax news agency quoted Titarenko as saying.A court in the Urals region delivered a similar ruling on Wednesday when it ordered the closure of a McDonald's restaurant in the city of Yekaterinburg for 85 days, backing the food safety watchdog's decision the day before.McDonald's operates 440 restaurants in Russia and considers the country one of its top seven markets outside the United States and Canada, according to its 2013 annual report. Almost 1 million people a day visit its restaurants in Russia.

190,"   By Barbara Goldberg and Lisa Baertlein | NEW YORK/LOS ANGELES  NEW YORK/LOS ANGELES U.S. fast-food workers staged protests in some 150 cities on Thursday in a fight for higher pay, and organizers said more than 450 were arrested from Manhattan's Times Square to Los Angeles.About 400 protesters clogged Times Square during morning rush hour in the latest of ongoing actions aimed at raising their wage to $15 an hour. They hoisted placards reading ""Stick together for $15 and union rights,"" and some held a sit-in at a McDonald's restaurant, prompting 19 arrests for disorderly conduct.Sit-ins also were held in other cities, and organizers said 465 arrests were made among protesters from Chicago, Detroit, Little Rock, Arkansas, Kansas City, Houston and Nashville.In Los Angeles, protesters confronted managers inside two McDonald's restaurants. And near Milwaukee, U.S. Representative Gwen Moore was among 27 people arrested. McDonald's worker Latoya Walker, who lives in a homeless shelter in Queens and makes $8 per hour, joined Thursday's march for her five young children. ""With $15, I'd be able to save up enough to rent a home for my kids,"" Walker said. Protest organizers said Thursday's actions were the biggest to date, targeting chains including McDonald's, Burger King, Wendy's and KFC.In Kansas City, protester Dana Wittman, 38, said the $9 an hour she makes at Pizza Hut is not enough for her family. ""I have to choose between paying my rent and putting food on the table,"" she said.  The recurring union-backed actions, which started in New York City, have steadily gathered steam since late 2012. They have helped spur a national debate about the federal minimum wage, which has been $7.25 since 2009, despite efforts by Democrats in Congress to raise it ahead of November's mid-term congressional elections.Protesters, many of whom are adults working 40 hours or more a week, say they cannot survive on such pay. Experts say about $11 an hour is the poverty threshold for a family of four. U.S. fast-food restaurants this year are expected to make profits of $7.2 billion on revenue of $198.9 billion, according to research firm IBISWorld. Most of their U.S. restaurants are owned by franchisees, who set their own wages and say that raising the hourly wage will hurt their businesses. Workers claimed a victory in July when the general counsel of the National Labor Relations Board said McDonald's, not just its franchisees, can be liable for alleged labor law violations. But experts say it could take months, if not years, to resolve the cases.A McDonald's spokeswoman said the world's biggest fast-food chain supports paying wages that are competitive in local markets and reflect a worker's skill and experience.The drive is being led by the Service Employees International Union, which has 2 million members. The International Franchise Association said unions want ""a shortcut to refill their steadily dwindling membership ranks and coffers.""

""There are going to be workers who don't show up to work or who walk off the job at 12:01 a.m. or at noon.""Observing the various job actions will be international delegations of workers from 13 countries in Europe, Asia and South America, he said. The protests come as cities across the United States propose minimum wage increases while Democrats in Congress seek to raise the federal minimum wage ahead of November's mid-term congressional elections.A recent report by the Economic Policy Institute think tank  found the typical worker in the restaurant industry makes $10 an hour compared to $18 an hour typically earned in other industries. One in six restaurant workers, or 16.7 percent, lives below the official poverty line, compared to 6.3 percent of those working in other industries, the report said.Fast-food workers are even poorer, earning an average of less than $8 an hour, according to the Service Employees International Union, which supports the fast-food workers' protests. ""Nobody who works 40 hours a week should be living in poverty,"" U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont, said on Twitter. ""I applaud the fast-food workers all across the country who will be striking on Thursday to raise the minimum wage to a living wage.""The protests are the latest in a series over the past two years and were expected to take place in more than 150 cities including New York, Atlanta, Detroit and Los Angeles.In Cleveland, hundreds of home health aides seeking better compensation were expected to turn out in a show of support for the fast-food workers, Fells said.

McDonald's is the third-worst performing Dow component in 2014, behind only General Electric and Boeing Co. While the fast food space has in general been weak this year - Yum Brands is down 4.3 percent and Wendy's Co  is off 8 percent - Burger King Worldwide is bucking that trend, with a year-to-date gain of 41 percent.Despite that, McDonald's is considered inexpensive based on StarMine's intrinsic value, which looks at anticipated growth over the next decade. That metric indicates that McDonald's should be trading at $101.30.

199,"  (Adds statement from McDonald's, other corporations)By Steve Ginsburg and Anjali AthavaleySept 16 Anheuser-Busch publicly chastised the National Football League on Tuesday for its handling of domestic violence cases, making the NFL's official beer sponsor the first major advertiser to put pressure on America's most popular sports league.In a brief but strongly worded statement, Anheuser-Busch, the maker of Budweiser and NFL official beer Bud Light, said it was ""disappointed and increasingly concerned by the recent incidents that have overshadowed this NFL season.""We are not yet satisfied with the league's handling of behaviors that so clearly go against our own company culture and moral code.""The company, owned by Belgian-Brazilian group Anheuser-Busch InBev, said it had shared its concerns and expectations with the 32-team league, a TV ratings juggernaut that brings in $9 billion in annual revenue.""We understand,"" NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said of the Anheuser-Busch remarks. ""We are taking action and there will be much more to come.""Another NFL sponsor and mainstay of American culture, McDonald's Corp, said it also communicated its concerns to the league and expects the NFL ""to take strong and necessary actions to address these issues.""Visa Inc, Campbell's Soup Co and Procter & Gamble's cosmetic's unit Covergirl also issued similar statements this week.The rebuke from Corporate America could raise pressure on NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, already struggling to make amends after his initial light punishment of former Baltimore Ravens star Ray Rice for  punching his then-girlfriend, now his wife, in February. The NFL and team owners are also dealing with at least three other domestic abuse cases and a wide swath of Americans are closely watching how they react to mounting public pressure to take forceful measures with players who engage in domestic violence.PETERSON CASE CRITICIZED When a security video emerged last week of Rice knocking his wife out cold, Goodell suspended Rice indefinitely and said he had not seen that video when he handed down his original two-game ban in July. He had, however, seen a previous video showing Rice dragging an unconscious Janay Rice out of the elevator.Goodell apologized for his initial punishment and has since increased the mandatory ban to six games for domestic violence. After the second video emerged and reports that the NFL had seen it, the league ordered an independent investigation into the handling of the Rice case. Rice, 27, has until midnight ET on Tuesday to appeal his suspension.Compounding the NFL's problems last week was the indictment of Adrian Peterson, the Minnesota Vikings running back - one of the league's most marketable stars - who has been charged with child abuse in Texas for beating his son with a tree branch.Peterson was reactivated by the Vikings on Monday after sitting out Sunday's game.On Tuesday, Minnesota Governor Mark Dayton entered the fray by saying the Vikings should sideline Peterson until his case works its way through court.The Radisson hotel chain said it was suspending a sponsorship deal with the Vikings as it monitors the case. Two other players involved in domestic violence cases are also under the league's microscope, Greg Hardy of the Carolina Panthers and Ray McDonald of the San Francisco 49ers.ADVERTISERS MAY HOLD KEY After the alarming video of Rice's punch surfaced last week, NFL experts said that advertisers could play a pivotal role in whether Goodell survives the worst crisis of his eight-year tenure.Verizon Communications Chief Executive Lowell McAdam, while acknowledging the Rice episode had been disturbing, gave his backing to Goodell, calling him ""a man of high integrity.""But as the controversy moved into the homes of millions of Americans, troubled by what they had seen on the video, Anheuser-Busch's move suggests a changing sentiment among the game's stalwart corporate backers.""I'm not surprised by it. I think there is such attention of what's going on with the NFL off the field,"" Brad Adgate, senior vice president, director of research at Horizon Media, an advertising services agency.The swirling domestic violence scandal has also called into question the NFL's relationship with women, a demographic it has actively wooed. Women now account for 45 percent of the league's audience.One sponsor geared toward women fans, Covergirl, said on its Facebook page Monday that ""we have encouraged the NFL to take swift action on their path forward to address the issue of domestic violence.""

200,"   By Mica Rosenberg | Sept 17  Sept 17 Two Republican lawmakers on Wednesday asked a U.S. labor agency for more information about a recent finding that fast-food chain McDonald's Corp could be held liable for the labor practices of franchisees, a view that has alarmed many businesses.The lawmakers said the Democratic-controlled National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) is trying to rewrite long-held rules governing labor relations between parent companies and franchises that are run as independent businesses.The questioning comes just as fast-food workers are staging nationwide protests to push for higher wages, in a major union-led organization drive.NLRB General Counsel Richard Griffin announced in July that the world's largest restaurant chain could be held liable for alleged labor law violations at franchised restaurants. Until now, McDonald's and other companies that make wide use of franchisees and contract employers have been insulated from such liability by the NLRB's ""joint employer"" standard.U.S. Representatives John Kline and Phil Roe, in a letter to the agency, called the NLRB general counsel's finding ""unprecedented"" and asked the board to provide more documents by the end of September about its decision-making. The two Republicans are on the U.S. House of Representatives workforce committee. ""Our question is, what problem are you attempting to fix? We know that the franchise business model works well,"" Roe said in a telephone interview.The NLRB said it had no comment on the letter, which was being reviewed by the Office of General Counsel. The board announced in April that it was considering changing the 30-year-old standard and asked interested parties to weigh in. The board has yet to make a decision.Griffin's brief announcement in July related to 43 complaints lodged against McDonald's and was just a first step in a long process for handling charges filed by workers with the NLRB. McDonald's has said it will contest the action.Several owners of small franchise chains testified at a congressional hearing last week that any permanent shift in the board's policy could lead to more meddling in their operations by parent companies. Catherine Ruckelshaus, an attorney at the National Employment Law Project, a low-wage workers advocacy group, said in a phone interview that changes in NLRB standards are needed to adapt to the modern workplace. ""Everyone is pointing fingers at everyone else and no one is being held accountable or responsible.""In a separate hearing on Wednesday, House Republicans criticized the Obama administration's Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) for ""harassing"" employers with unsubstantiated charges.Republican Representative Tim Walberg said in a statement some ""employers have fallen under EEOC's intense scrutiny without any allegation of employment discrimination."" Walberg is pushing for legislative proposals for more EEOC oversight.Michael Foreman, director of the Civil Rights Appellate Clinic at Pennsylvania State University's Dickinson School, said the proposals would hamper the EEOC's ability to enforce the law. ""There's no pattern of EEOC abuse,"" he said.

201,"  (Recasts, adds comments from NFL sponsor TD Ameritrade, Vikings owner, Nancy Pelosi, background)By Eric KelseySept 17 Grievances against the NFL's response to domestic abuse cases gathered pace on Wednesday as the Minnesota Vikings acknowledged making a mistake with its treatment of star player Adrian Peterson and corporate sponsors joined the chorus of discontent with America's top sports league.Brokerage firm TD Ameritrade, which began a three-year affiliation with the NFL this month, said ""it was very much considering its future"" as a sponsor. Nike Inc  said it had suspended its contract with Peterson.The Vikings on Wednesday issued the latest mea culpa from the NFL. A flurry of domestic violence cases, most notably those of Peterson and Ray Rice, the Baltimore Ravens star who has been suspended indefinitely, has raised questions about the league's integrity and the leadership of commissioner Roger Goodell. Even members of Congress are speaking out.The Vikings, which on Monday reactivated Peterson for this Sunday's NFL game following his indictment last week in Texas in a case involving his 4-year-old son, reversed course by placing him on a special exempt list that suspends him from all team activities.""We made a mistake, and we needed to get this right,"" Vikings co-owner Zygi Wilf said at a news conference, adding that he and his brother, Vikings co-owner Mark Wilf, had listened to ""our fans, the community and our sponsors.""The 29-year-old Peterson, the Vikings' best player, has been accused of reckless or negligent injury to a child, stemming from a whipping incident that allegedly left bruises and wounds on his son.The NFL called his suspension ""a good decision.""The Vikings will continue to pay the running back his full $11.75 million salary for this season. Team general manager Rick Spielman declined to say whether Peterson would play again this season. If Peterson's case goes to trial it would likely begin in 2015. NIKE SUSPENDS PETERSON CONTRACT Corporate America has piled onto the criticism this week. The moves from TD Ameritrade and Nike come a day after the NFL was chastised by one of its top sponsors, brewer Anheuser-Busch.""We want to see (the NFL) learn from its mistakes and work quickly to improve a culture that values inclusion, safety and respect for its employees, their families and others,"" TD Ameritrade spokeswoman Kim Hillyer said in an email.Nike Inc, which has a reputation for steadfastly sticking by its top athletes, issued a statement on its decision to suspend its contract with Peterson, one of the most marketable players in the league. ""Nike in no way condones child abuse or domestic violence of any kind and we have shared our concerns with the NFL,"" the Oregon-based sporting goods company said in a statement.Mark Wilf said the franchise did not suspend Peterson in a bow to pressure from team sponsors. Minnesota-based hotel chain Radisson suspended a sponsorship deal with the Vikings on Monday.The team also came under pressure from Minnesota Governor Mark Dayton, who said on Tuesday that Peterson was a ""public embarrassment"" to the team and state and should be suspended.Several other NFL sponsors, such as McDonald's Corp, Visa Inc and Campbell Soup Co said they have voiced their concerns to the league about its handling of domestic violence cases.But no sponsor has gone so far as to cut its multimillion-dollar ties with the NFL. CONGRESS HAS A ""ROLE"" Goodell and the league are struggling to make amends for his initial lenient punishment of Rice, who punched his then-fiancee, now his wife, in February, striking her unconscious.Although Goodell has announced stricter penalties for domestic violence offenders, that has done little to stem the tidal wave of public criticism following the release of surveillance video last week that showed Rice's punch, which the league said it had never seen.On Wednesday, U.S. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said Congress could get involved because the league, which takes in $9 billion in annual revenue, has an anti-trust exemption.""I think Congress always has a role, but again if you're talking about anti-trust privileges and the rest of that, that certainly is a big issue and it cannot be done except by the Congress,"" Pelosi said at her weekly news conference in the Capitol, after being peppered with NFL questions.Goodell has since apologized for the handling of the Rice case. The Pro Bowl running back on Tuesday appealed his indefinite suspension, which came after the video's publication.Two other players involved in domestic violence cases are Carolina Panthers' Greg Hardy, who was benched last week, and San Francisco 49ers' Ray McDonald, who played.Pelosi, an avid 49ers fan, said McDonald should not have taken the field.

202,"   By Lisa Baertlein  LOS ANGELES - When Kathryn Slater-Carter learned her family would lose $1.5 million after McDonald's Corp did not renew the franchise agreement on one of their restaurants in the San Francisco suburbs, she tried for a second time to change state law to protect franchisee investments.That renewed effort may bear some fruit. California lawmakers in August passed the new bill she championed and Governor Jerry Brown has until Sept. 30 to sign or veto it.At present, California law only requires franchisors that terminate or fail to renew a franchise agreement to offer to repurchase a franchisee's inventory.Among other things, the pending legislation known as SB 610 would require a franchisor that terminates an agreement without a material breach to compensate the franchisee for the fair value of their business, or to provide them an opportunity to sell.The watered-down law passed by lawmakers would not have prevented the equity loss Slater-Carter says her family suffered when their McDonald's restaurant in a Daly City, California, shopping mall was forced to close, but ""it's a start,"" she said. The franchise agreement on her family's one remaining Daly City restaurant expires in 2016. A spokeswoman for McDonald's said that the mall restaurant closed because the franchise and lease agreements each expired. She added that the company did not play a part in that timing.Groups representing big companies and franchisees have clashed over the bill in what some experts say is one of California's biggest business battles this year.The International Franchise Association (IFA), a trade group representing McDonald's and other well-funded franchisors, led the opposition. They warn that the legislation could weaken a franchisor's ability to enforce brand standards, damage franchisee equity by protecting weak operators and result in frivolous lawsuits.      Supporters are a coalition that includes the American Association of Franchisees & Dealers and the Service Employees International Union, which has backed fast-food worker protests at franchisee-owned restaurants.

It is very unlikely that production will be resumed soon,"" OSI said in the statement. It added that a small of number of Shanghai Husi staff would be kept on to assist with the ongoing investigation.""As such, Shanghai Husi cannot be fully shut down at this stage,"" the firm added. Yum has fully cut ties with OSI in China, while McDonald's has suspended its ties with the firm pending the outcome of a Chinese investigation. China is Yum's biggest market and McDonald's third largest by outlets.The incident - just one of a series of food safety issues to hit China over the past year - has underlined the challenge of regulating supply chains in China, where food scandals can have a major impact on a firm's sales and reputation. OSI said it had stated a redundancy programme for the Shanghai plant on Monday. A total of 340 staff would be made redundant, including 226 directly employed by Shanghai Husi and a further 114 contractors.""It was our expectation that they could resume their work as soon as possible. Unfortunately, due to circumstances beyond our control, this will not be the case,"" the firm added.A series of firms including retailer Wal-Mart Stores Inc , French grocer Carrefour SA and ketchup maker HJ Heinz Co have all been caught in food safety scares in China.

205,"  BEIJING China on Saturday sentenced two members of a banned religious cult - a father and daughter - to death for the murder in a McDonald's restaurant of a woman who refused an apparent attempt by the group to recruit her, state media said.The 37-year-old woman, surnamed Wu, was attacked in May in the eastern province of Shandong by members of Quannengshen, the Church of Almighty God, which had preached that a global apocalypse would take place in 2012.The case sparked a national outcry after it was revealed that Wu was beaten to death for refusing to give her telephone number to members of the group. The Yantai Intermediate People's Court sentenced Zhang Fan and her father, Zhang Lidong, to death for intentional homicide and gave another member of the group, Lu Yingchun, life in prison, the official Xinhua news agency said.""Zhang Hang and Zhang Qiaolian, another two cult members, were sentenced to ten and seven years of jail terms respectively,"" Xinhua said. Zhang Hang is also a daughter of Zhang Lidong. Xinhua did not report ages of the five defendants, who were tried in August.KICKING AND STOMPING  According to Xinhua, Zhang Fan and Lu had called Wu an ""evil spirit"" and the group beat, kicked, and stomped on her head until she died on the scene.The Quannengshen group, which originated in central Henan province, believes that Jesus was resurrected as Yang Xiangbin, wife of the sect's founder, Zhao Weishan, according to previous  Xinhua reports.Zhao is also known as Xu Wenshan, Xinhua has said, adding that the couple fled to the United States in September 2000. In 2012, China launched a crackdown on the group, which  called for a ""decisive battle"" to slay the ""Red Dragon"" Communist Party, and preached that the world would end that year.The party brooks no challenge to its rule and is obsessed with social stability. It has cracked down on cults, which have multiplied in recent years. Demonstrations have been put down with force and some sect leaders executed.In 1999, then-President Jiang Zemin launched a campaign to crush the Falun Gong religious group. It was banned as ""evil cult"" after thousands of practitioners staged a surprise but peaceful sit-in outside the leadership compound in Beijing to demand official recognition of their movement.

206,"   By Lisa Baertlein  McDonald's Corp (MCD.N) Chief Executive Officer Don Thompson owned up to some corporate image problems on Tuesday after it posted a nearly one-third drop in quarterly profit and warned that its global restaurant sales would fall again this month.Stock in the fast-food chain, which Thompson conceded is sometimes seen as little more than ""a manufacturing plant,"" was down 0.6 percent at $91 in afternoon trading after reporting a 30 percent fall in third-quarter net income to $1.07 billion and traffic declines in every major region.Thompson, who has been CEO for just over two years of his 25-year career at McDonald's, said the company that now serves some 70 million customers a day worldwide has at various times during its history faced questions about whether it is still relevant to consumers, who are now craving more fresh, unprocessed food.  ""McDonald's is in the business of satisfying customers and that will never fall out of favor. The question is what do you do to do that?"" Thompson asked Reuters in a telephone interview.McDonald's has posted a string of disappointing results, due to uncontrollable factors and internal missteps, since Thompson took the helm in July 2012. Wall Street analysts, many of whom underscore McDonald's deliberate business style, predict that the company will give Thompson at least a year to move the needle.To that end, Thompson said McDonald's is simplifying menus, tailoring food to local tastes, offering custom burger and sandwich options, rolling out mobile services such as payments and ordering, and opening a social media ""dialogue"" with customers. Technology has made customized ordering simpler and will give McDonald's the opportunity to showcase its fresh produce and other ingredients, Thompson said.Last week, McDonald's launched a U.S. online campaign called ""Our food. Your questions."" and invited consumers to ask anything about its food. It opened the campaign by directly addressing food-quality rumors with questions such as: ""Is 'pink slime' in a Chicken McNugget?"" ""Why doesn't your food rot?"" ""Are there worms in your beef?""   Thus far, the response has been mixed. Survey data from YouGov BrandIndex showed that the campaign, coupled with McDonald's recent Monopoly game promotion, appeared to temporarily lift quality perception and purchase consideration in the younger, sought-after Millennial demographic that favors the likes of Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG.N). Nevertheless, McDonald's key demographic of frequent fast-food eaters were largely unmoved by the campaigns, YouGov spokesman Drew Kerr said.""When you've been around for multiple decades like McDonald's has, you can't change on a dime,"" said Janney Capital Markets analyst Mark Kalinowski.When it comes to changing perception, Thompson acknowledged that the company has work to do. ""We've largely been viewed as a manufacturing plant. They haven't seen the food,"" said Thompson. McDonald's quarterly results showed sales at restaurants open at least 13 months fell a steeper-than-expected 3.3 percent in the United States, where smaller and more nimble fast-food rivals as well as Chipotle, known for using pricier antibiotic-free meats and organic produce, are taking a bite out of McDonald's market share. Chipotle on Monday reported an eye-popping 19.8 percent gain in third-quarter, same-restaurant sales.    McDonald's Europe sales at established restaurants fell 1.4 percent, hurt by economic weakness in regional powerhouse Germany and dragged down by political upheaval in Ukraine and Russia, formerly a fast-growing market for McDonald's.    McDonald's Asia-Pacific, Middle East and Africa unit said same-restaurant sales tumbled 9.9 percent, after this summer's China supplier scandal pummeled sales around the region. Executives said same-restaurant sales in China fell 22.7 percent during the latest quarter. They added that it could take  six to nine months for the business to normalize in affected markets, including China, Japan and Hong Kong.

207,"   By Anjali Athavaley | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Oct 21 The strong dollar is beginning to take a toll on U.S. companies with big businesses overseas.Coca Cola Co and McDonald's Corp on Tuesday became the latest multinationals to get sideswiped by the surging U.S. currency, which typically crimps demand for U.S. exports and reduces the value of overseas sales when they are translated back into U.S. dollars.Coke, whose quarterly profit slumped 14 percent, said it now estimates that currency will have a 6 percentage-point negative impact on full-year operating income, and expects to come in below its long-term earnings per share target for 2014.McDonald's forecast currency to cut fourth-quarter earnings per share by 5 cents to 6 cents, after shaving 1 cent off third-quarter earnings per share.Last week, Wal-Mart Stores Inc cut its annual sales forecast, pointing to a stronger dollar and the impact of food stamp reductions as the two main factors. The effects have not been restricted to companies in the consumer space: IBM on Monday said it expected dollar appreciation to have a significant impact on its fourth quarter and 2015 results - one more negative element in a generally gloomy earnings report.And United Technologies Corp on Tuesday cited the stronger U.S. currency in cutting its full-year profit forecast for its Otis elevators division, which generates a large chunk of its business outside the country, by about $50 million.The U.S. dollar index, which measures the value of the greenback against a basket of currencies made up of United States' major trading partners, rose 7.74 percent in the third quarter. A one percentage point move in the dollar typically translates to a two percentage point impact on earnings, said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia.NEW ENVIRONMENT  Corporations are having to adjust to a new environment after more than a decade of enjoying the benefits of a relatively weak dollar on their earnings, analysts said. That means investors can expect more changes to guidance going forward.To be sure, the pain isn't across the board. Apple Inc , which derives 60 percent of revenue from international sales, acknowledged that currency will be a headwind but did not seem overly concerned. The company forecast a strong December quarter after a higher-than-expected 16 percent jump in iPhone sales in the most recent quarter.For Coke and McDonald's, two brands struggling to reconnect with consumers, the robust U.S. currency is a further headache. Coke, like other soft drink makers, is grappling with nearly a decade of declines in domestic soda sales as people have become more health conscious. Meanwhile, McDonald's has been losing share among the coveted millennial demographic to more upscale brands like Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc.""When other things aren't going well, you don't need that added to the mix,"" said Mike O'Rourke, chief market strategist JonesTrading in Greenwich, Conn. ""I think what we're going to see over the next quarter or so are just a resetting of expectations.""That could tempt some companies to emphasize currency headwinds and downplay deeper problems with operations, said O'Rourke. But there is a downside: ""When the truth eventually comes out, investors usually punch the stock.""

208,"  (Recasts with CEO and analyst comment)By Lisa BaertleinOct 21 McDonald's Corp Chief Executive Officer Don Thompson owned up to some corporate image problems on Tuesday after it posted a nearly one-third drop in quarterly profit and warned that its global restaurant sales would fall again this month.Stock in the fast-food chain, which Thompson conceded is sometimes seen as little more than ""a manufacturing plant,"" was down 0.6 percent at $91 in afternoon trading after reporting a 30 percent fall in third-quarter net income to $1.07 billion and traffic declines in every major region.Thompson, who has been CEO for just over two years of his 25-year career at McDonald's, said the company that now serves some 70 million customers a day worldwide has at various times during its history faced questions about whether it is still relevant to consumers, who are now craving more fresh, unprocessed food.""McDonald's is in the business of satisfying customers and that will never fall out of favor. The question is what do you do to do that?"" Thompson asked Reuters in a telephone interview.McDonald's has posted a string of disappointing results, due to uncontrollable factors and internal missteps, since Thompson took the helm in July 2012.Wall Street analysts, many of whom underscore McDonald's deliberate business style, predict that the company will give Thompson at least a year to move the needle. To that end, Thompson said McDonald's is simplifying menus, tailoring food to local tastes, offering custom burger and sandwich options, rolling out mobile services such as payments and ordering, and opening a social media ""dialogue"" with customers.Technology has made customized ordering simpler and will give McDonald's the opportunity to showcase its fresh produce and other ingredients, Thompson said.Last week, McDonald's launched a U.S. online campaign called ""Our food. Your questions."" and invited consumers to ask anything about its food. It opened the campaign by directly addressing food-quality rumors with questions such as: ""Is 'pink slime' in a Chicken McNugget?"" ""Why doesn't your food rot?"" ""Are there worms in your beef?""Thus far, the response has been mixed. Survey data from YouGov BrandIndex showed that the campaign, coupled with McDonald's recent Monopoly game promotion, appeared to temporarily lift quality perception and purchase consideration in the younger, sought-after Millennial demographic that favors the likes of Chipotle Mexican Grill .Nevertheless, McDonald's key demographic of frequent fast-food eaters were largely unmoved by the campaigns, YouGov spokesman Drew Kerr said.""When you've been around for multiple decades like McDonald's has, you can't change on a dime,"" said Janney Capital Markets analyst Mark Kalinowski. When it comes to changing perception, Thompson acknowledged that the company has work to do.""We've largely been viewed as a manufacturing plant. They haven't seen the food,"" said Thompson.McDonald's quarterly results showed sales at restaurants open at least 13 months fell a steeper-than-expected 3.3 percent in the United States, where smaller and more nimble fast-food rivals as well as Chipotle, known for using pricier antibiotic-free meats and organic produce, are taking a bite out of McDonald's market share. Chipotle on Monday reported an eye-popping 19.8 percent gain in third-quarter, same-restaurant sales.McDonald's Europe sales at established restaurants fell 1.4 percent, hurt by economic weakness in regional powerhouse Germany and dragged down by political upheaval in Ukraine and Russia, formerly a fast-growing market for McDonald's.McDonald's Asia-Pacific, Middle East and Africa unit said same-restaurant sales tumbled 9.9 percent, after this summer's China supplier scandal pummeled sales around the region.Executives said same-restaurant sales in China fell 22.7 percent during the latest quarter. They added that it could take  six to nine months for the business to normalize in affected markets, including China, Japan and Hong Kong.

Europe, which just edges out the United States as McDonald's top revenue market, is grappling with political and economic issues as McDonald's Asia works through the upheaval from a scandal involving a major supplier in China.Chief Executive Officer Don Thompson said in a statement that the company is taking steps to revive McDonald's global business. For example, in the United States, where McDonald's relatively inexpensive burgers and fries are falling out of favor, the company is directly addressing rumors about its food quality. Results, thus far, seem mixed.Last week, McDonald's launched a social media campaign called ""Our food. Your questions.""

211,"   By Chris Arsenault  ROME, Oct 24 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - It's not the kind of fact most food vendors want to showcase, but faced with sluggish demand for its burgers and criticism over preservatives in its products, McDonald's has launched a campaign to prove that its food does, indeed, rot.The company seems to be responding to some negative press, including an online video purporting to show a 14-year-old hamburger which didn't look like it had gone bad.""There have been a lot of online videos and photos touting the fact that when left out for an extended period of time, a McDonald's hamburger does not rot and that this is because they are laden with chemicals,"" food scientist Keith Warner wrote on McDonald's official website in response to a question. ""The reality is that McDonald's hamburgers, french fries and chicken are like all foods, and do rot if kept under certain conditions.""Restaurants don't usually splash out marketing dollars to promote the rotting of their food. But the campaign launched this month -- ""Our food. Your questions"" -- aims to do that and more. ""We are taking action to restore customer trust,"" Don Thompson, McDonald's CEO said in a news release issued on Tuesday after the company reported that profits fell by nearly one-third in the last quarter. Health advocates, however, were not convinced that the new campaign can change the fortunes of one of the world's largest restaurant chains.""Clearly, McDonald's is on a mission to make us believe that their food is natural and fresh, but consumers are not fooled so easily,"" Vicki Hird, spokeswoman for the health advocacy group Sustain, said in an email to the Thomson Reuters Foundation.""Eating heavily processed fast food products will always be less nutritious and have greater levels of preservatives, flavourings and other additives compared to cooking from fresh from a known source.""

223,"  SHANGHAI A criminal gang in eastern China has sold almost 100 metric tons (110.23 tons) of toxic tofu onto the local market, the latest in a string of scares that have thrown light on shady practices in the country's food industry. The gang added industrial bleaching agent rongalite to make dried tofu sticks brighter and chewier, the Shanghai Daily reported on Monday, citing official media in Shandong province. Rongalite is banned in food production as it can lead to cancer. Gut-wrenching food scares erupt regularly in China and highlight the challenges firms face to control supply chains. A supplier to KFC parent Yum Brands Inc and McDonald's Corp came under fire in July after a report showed workers using expired meat. U.S. retailer Wal-Mart Stores Inc recalled some donkey meat products in January after tests showed they contained traces of fox. Media reports made no mention if the tofu factory had supplied any large local or global chains operating in China. The local Qilu Evening News newspaper said the gang, led by three cousins, had bags of rongalite powder stacked against the walls of the factory. The chemical was then added into the mix to make the dried tofu sticks, also called ""fuzhu"", a popular snack in China. ""The factory floor was filthy and there was a choking odor in the premises. Workers were busy making fuzhu with utensils that were covered in dirt,"" police official Zhang Qinchao told the local paper.Police detained four men involved in the operation and seized nearly 10 metric tons of toxic tofu, but said a further 100 tonnes had already been sold by the gang within Shandong and nearby Henan and Jiangxi provinces. No one has yet been reported ill from eating the affected products, the report said.

226,"   By Luciana Lopez and Lisa Baertlein | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Jana Partners LLC, the $11 billion hedge fund run by Barry Rosenstein, took a new stake in Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc and vastly increased its holdings of  online auction site eBay Inc in the third quarter, according to a regulatory filing on Friday.Jana bought 1.284 million shares of Valeant, which has been trying to buy Botox-maker Allergan Inc this year. But the hostile bid soon brought scrutiny from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which began looking at the potential deal in August.Jana added more than 12 million shares of eBay, bringing its total stake to 13.063 million shares.EBay this year bowed to pressure from activist investor Carl Icahn to spin off its PayPal payments service. The action is expected to give PayPal more flexibility to make deals in the rapidly evolving payments sector as growth in eBay's traditional e-commerce business slows.Jana declined to comment. Messages to eBay and Valeant requesting comment were not immediately returned. Rosenstein's fund also increased its stakes in Groupon Inc by 10 percent, for a total of 51.68 million shares, and increased its stake in Walgreen Co, by 12.5 percent, for a total 12.5 million shares.In September Rosenstein won a seat on the Walgreen board.Also in the third quarter, Jana took a new stake, of 300,000 shares, in Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba Group Holding Ltd and a new stake, of 842,268 shares, in fast-food company McDonald's Corp. Jana became the latest among activist investors - those sensing the opportunity to help turn around struggling businesses - to focus on McDonald's.""We welcome all investments in McDonald's,"" a McDonald's spokeswoman said. ""As always, our focus is on maximizing shareholder value through initiatives that ultimately benefit our customers."" After Don Thompson became chief executive in July 2012, business at McDonald's, which outperformed its peers during the recession, began to slow.The 13F filings with regulators made by Jana and other funds provide a window onto the strategies of some of the world's biggest investors. But the view is limited. Not only do the documents look back to the previous quarter, they do not disclose short positions. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission also sometimes allows money managers not to disclose sensitive positions.

Many have reopened since, but according to the company, there are still 200 inspections ongoing and four restaurants outside Moscow remain closed.The country's food safety agency, Rospotrebnadzor, said the closures, which came after unexpected inspections, were not related to the Russia standoff with the West.

The growth rate is to remain unchanged next year, Polyakova said.When the now-reopened McDonald's restaurant first opened in central Moscow on Pushkin Square, it became an iconic symbol of flourishing American capitalism during the fall of the Soviet Union.

229,"  EditorsNote: adds Drake quotesNo suspense in DePaul win this timeROSEMONT, Ill. -- DePaul skipped the thrills and instead concentrated on playing 40 consistent minutes of basketball Tuesday.Blue Demons guard Billy Garrett said there were a few problematic minutes, but it is hard to quibble as DePaul claimed an 80-62 non-conference victory over Drake in its Allstate Arena home opener.""We wanted to come out today and jump out on them,"" said Garrett, who collected a team-high 15 points. ""We emphasized playing hard and doing the little things throughout the 40 minutes. And I think we played pretty hard, played pretty well for about 35 minutes. ... The consistency is encouraging.""Forward Myke Henry added 13 points as the Blue Demons claimed a 2-0 opening record for the first time in three seasons.DePaul trailed once early in the game and then used effective perimeter shooting to build a 38-25 halftime advantage. The Blue Demons led by as many as 20 points in the second half and the margin never slipped under double digits as forward Jamee Crockett scored 12 points, forward Forrest Robinson had 11 and guard Durrell McDonald added 10.Drake forward Chris Caird scored 19 points, while guard Jordan Daniels added 17 points and four assists for the Bulldogs (0-2).""Jordan settled down and made the extra pass and in turn he found himself getting open looks,"" Drake coach Ray Giacoletti said. ""He settled down and got into a nice rhythm. It comes back 10-fold if you make a nice pass to someone else."" In last Saturday's 72-71 season-opening victory over Illinois-Chicago, the Blue Demons saw a 16-point halftime advantage vanish and needed Garrett's game-winning 3-pointer to secure the win.""We wanted to close out the game,"" DePaul coach Oliver Purnell said. ""We didn't want to let up like we did in the first game."" The Blue Demons shot 55.1 percent (27-of-49) from the field, including 9-of-20 (45 percent) on 3-point tries. After hitting just 32.1 percent in the opening half, the Bulldogs' shooting improved and they closed with 23-of-54 (42.6 percent). DePaul outrebounded Drake 33-26.DePaul sprinted to an early 21-8 lead behind 4-of-8 shooting from beyond the arc, including a pair of 3-pointers from McDonald.Drake replied with a 14-7 surge -- including back-to-back Caird 3-pointers -- that cut the DePaul lead to 27-22. The Blue Demons went on an 11-3 run through the final 4:34 for a 38-25 halftime lead.Also Tuesday at Allstate Arena, the No. 18 DePaul women (3-1) beat in-state rival Bradley 101-77 as six Blue Demons hit double figures led by Brittany Hrynko's 19 points. Fantasia Vine had 13 the Braves (0-2).""When you get it back to what we had in the second half, you have to be able to get stops,"" Giacoletti said. ""Those are things you have to be able to do collectively as a group and get stops. We're undermanned right now without two seniors, and we're trying to hold this together and get young guys better.""NOTES: Last week's decision over Illinois-Chicago was DePaul's seventh straight season-opening win. The Blue Demons are 81-11 all-time in the season's first game. ... The Blue Demons are off for eight days for exams before hosting Lehigh in a Nov. 26 non-conference game. ... Drake, predicted to finish ninth in the Missouri Valley Conference, fell 77-58 in last Saturday's season opener against Bowling Green. Freshmen impressed in that game as G Reed Timmer paced the Bulldogs with a team-high 16 points and G C.J. Rivers pulled down six rebounds. ...

Then 18, Garcia confessed but later recanted, saying his admission was forced, attorney Raymond Aab said on his law firm's website.Garcia was acquitted of all charges stemming from the case in 2010 and he sued the city and the officer, Aab said. ""The settlement was considered to be in the best interest of the parties,"" a spokeswoman for the city's Law Department said. She did not provide any further details. Aab claimed on the law firm's website that Florio concocted the broken glass story in order to win money from McDonald's. The officer sued McDonald's for $6 million but later settled for $15,000, he said.Neither Aab nor Florio's former attorney, Richard Kenny, nor a representative of McDonald's could immediately be reached for comment.

234,"  HELSINKI Nov 24 Finnish packaging company Huhtamaki, known for making paper cups for McDonald's , has agreed to sell its films business in a deal led by German private equity company Deutsche Beteiligungs AG  for 141 million euros ($175 million).The business, which contributed 187 million euros of the group's 2.3 billion euros in total sales last year, provides films for labels, tapes and hygiene products.Huhtamaki, which had been reviewing options for the films business as the group focuses on food packaging, said it expects to book a small capital gain as well as a reduction in goodwill of about 45 million euros upon closing the deal. The majority of the business will be held by DBAG Fund VI and its management, while Deutsche Beteiligungs will hold 17 percent of it, the German company said. Huhtamaki announced in July that it would buy India's Positive Packaging for 247 million euros to increase its access to Indian and Middle Eastern markets. ""Following the divestment and the Positive Packaging deal, Huhtamaki has about 300-400 million euros to spend on acquisitions. Most likely it will seek growth from developing markets,"" said Inderes analyst Antti Viljakainen in a note to investors, adding that the deal's selling price was in line with his estimates.

235,"  NFL Team Report - St. Louis Rams - INSIDE SLANTSt. Louis Rams head coach Jeff Fisher and defensive coordinator Gregg Williams believe the team is making strides on defense, and a big reason is the continued development of strong safety T.J. McDonald, a third-round pick in 2013, and free safety Rodney McLeod, an undrafted free agent in 2012.Said Williams of the duo, ""They're very good players. They do a great job with all of the adjustments. Our safeties have to be in sync with the middle linebacker. Then our safeties and the middle linebacker have to be an extension of me from the sideline in the communication process of all the multiple things that we do. They're playing really good right now. Playing at a really high level and they're able to make some nice plays that on interceptions, pass breakups and also some contact issues, legally the way they're supposed to do it. They're doing very well. I'm very pleased with them. They're young and they're only going to get better.""McDonald is third on the team with 93 tackles, while McLeod with 72. McDonald is second on the team with 66 solo stops.Fisher has said he thinks McDonald is playing at a Pro-Bowl level, and McDonald was asked by the Oakland media where he believes he and McLeod rank.""I think that you have to put us up there with the top,"" McDonald said. ""I think that right now, how we're playing and what we've been doing - tackling well, doing things as far as showing different coverages and whatnot, confusing different offenses and being able to come down and make plays. It all comes down to making plays, and I feel like we've made plays. I think that we just have to keep putting those games together.""Williams also rates McDonald as Pro-Bowl caliber.""I think he is, I really do,"" Williams said. ""Really this last month he's played better each and every week. We're challenging him a lot behind the scenes. He's accepting every challenge. Even in (a recent) practice, I don't know if you guys watched him, a few things that I kind of attacked him on in the meetings that he brought out to the field and he did very well. I've been real pleased with how he's playing. Got to continue to stay healthy, but he's playing at an awful high level.While there were those that stereotyped McDonald as merely a box safety, Williams said, ""I liked him coming out and I really believe that his cover skills are more than adequate. He can do an awful lot of things in a lot of different systems, a lot of different design of the coverages. Until you get a chance to go and be with him and see all the different things that he can do, I think we've just scratched the surface on some of the things that we can do with him. He's a part of the game plan every week.""McDonald and McLeod have asserted themselves as leaders, along with middle linebacker James Laurinaitis.""You'll see that leadership has no age,"" Williams said. ""Guys who are leaders on your team set an example that somebody else wants to be like them. I think you're starting to see him be more vocal, too because the example of his play is now allowing him to speak more and he's starting to say more and do more things behind the scenes from a leadership role that normal people want to say, 'Well because a guy's talking he must be a leader.' Talking's not leadership. Doing is leadership and then when you do say something maybe they'll pay attention. He's doing a good job with that.""SERIES HISTORY: 13th regular-season meeting. Raiders lead series, 8-4. The two teams have split four games since the Rams moved to St. Louis from Los Angeles in 1995, the same year the Raiders returned from L.A. to Oakland. In those last four, the Rams won the only game played in St. Louis in 2002.----------------------------------------------- NFL Team Report - St. Louis Rams - NOTES, QUOTES--Wide receiver Stedman Bailey had seven receptions for 89 yards and a touchdown against San Diego and is getting more involved in the offense.Bailey had a good conclusion to his 2013 season, but was then suspended for the first four games of this season. The suspension was reduced to two games when the league and NFLPA agreed to an adjusted drug policy in September.However, with Brian Quick and Kenny Britt playing well, Bailey didn't get a lot of opportunities. He did this past Sunday. He was targeted nine times, and one of the receptions came on a fake punt that resulted in a first down. ""I just know that this is a game of patience,"" Bailey said. ""Sometimes you've got to be patient. And whenever your number's called, make sure you're there to make the play.""Said head coach Jeff Fisher, ""It's just games and situations and opportunities. We're settling in right now to a really good group. He's been obviously doing really good things for us on special teams. But it's (quarterback) Shaun (Hill) throwing the ball where the ball's supposed to go.""You can see what he can do. He had really good run after catch and was very productive.""--Rams right tackle Joe Barksdale was originally a third-round pick of the Raiders in 2011, but was waived early the following season. He became a starter near the end of the 2012 season, and has been a mainstay at that spot the last two seasons.Head coach Jeff Fisher told the Oakland media, ""Joe's been really solid, really solid for us out there. He's really fun to coach. He loves to practice and I'm just real proud of him. He's worked very hard and I think each week he's got a different challenge. He understands the difficulty in the matchups and he takes those challenges on. He knows he's not going to win every time, but he's a smart player and we were fortunate to be in the position to claim him.""--The Rams took a chance on wide receiver Kenny Britt in the offseason, and the gamble has worked out even if it was minimized by signing him to a one-year contract. Head coach Jeff Fisher was with the Titans when Britt was drafted, and believed in him. Now, it appears the Rams will try to re-sign him after the season.Said Fisher, ""He's been there every single day. He's not missed a practice. He plays through things in the game. He's doing a great job blocking for us. He's got big-play potential and it showed last week. He's really having fun. I think he's got a lot of football left in him.""Asked about Britt's maturation off the field, ""I've said this many times: It was wrong place at the wrong time. A lot of things were taken out of context. Has a big heart, loves the game, is a great teammate, he's always been that. I think he understands things are different now and you've got to be aware of your surroundings and all that. He is 110 percent into football right now and that's great.""--Defensive end Chris Long, currently on reserve/injured, designated for return, began his third week of practice and is getting close to being activated. Long began practicing on Nov. 12, so the 21-day period expires next Tuesday. After practice Wednesday, Fisher said, ""He's coming on. He did a little more today.""As for what long can mean to the defense when he returns and is able to play at a hogh level, Fisher said, ""We've missed him. We've missed his production. We've missed the consistent year after year sack production and his ability to play the run. When he comes back it should help us improve in those areas.""When asked if Long has begin lobbying to be activated, Fisher said, ""Yes, it's already started.""BY THE NUMBERS: 50-27 - Combined record of the seven teams the Rams have lost to this season. The Vikings (4-7) are the only team with a losing record. The other six have a combined record of 46-20.QUOTES TO NOTE: ""We discussed it this morning. It's just such a difficult situation. We had an opportunity to get involved in August with the three football teams and the organization has done some other things. Hopefully, as soon as things settle down then we'll get back involved. As we talked as a group it's our community, it's their neighbors. Everybody cares deeply about what's going on and hopes things can get settled as soon as possible."" - Coach Jeff Fisher on whether the team talks about the situation in Ferguson, Mo.----------------------------------------------- NFL Team Report - St. Louis Rams - STRATEGY AND PERSONNELPLAYER NOTES  --G Davin Joseph (not injury related) was added to the practice report Thursday when he did not practice.--LB Alec Ogletree (illness) was added to the practice report Thursday when he was limited in practice.--LB Will Herring (foot), who did not practice Wednesday was limited on Thursday.--CB Marcus Roberson (ankle), who has been inactive the last three games, continues to be sidelined and did not practice Wednesday or Thursday.--WR Kenny Britt (back), who did not practice Wednesday, participated fully on Thursday.--CB E.J.

On defense, they hope to get pressure on QB Derek Carr by stopping the run and putting the Raiders in long-yardage situations.MATCHUPS TO WATCH --Rams DRE Robert Quinn vs. Raiders LT Donald Penn. Oakland QB Derek Carr has been sacked just 12 times, and much of that is because he gets rid of the ball quickly and throws numerous short passes. His completions have averaged a mere 9.4 yards. Penn will work to keep the explosive Quinn away.--Rams RB Tre Mason vs. Raiders LBs Kahlil Mack, Sio Moore and Miles Burris. The Raiders have allowed a large number of rushing yards, thanks largely to opponents running the ball with leads. However, they have allowed just 3.8 yards per run. The Rams will try to establish the run with Mason, but it could be tough against Oakland's active linebackers. Burris is seco0nd on the team with 106 tackles, Moore third with 97 and Mack fourth with 64.",2014-11-29,MCD,"Sat Nov 29, 2014 | 12:20am EST",St. Louis Rams - TeamReport,http://www.reuters.com//article/fbn-rams-teamreport-idUSMTZEABTSEYAKH20141129?type=companyNews
236,"   By Lisa Baertlein  McDonald's Corp (MCD.N) on Monday reported a steeper-than-expected drop in global sales at established restaurants for November, hurt by weakness in the United States and Asia, and warned that such declines would ""significantly pressure"" margins this quarter.November marked the sixth straight month of worldwide same-restaurant sales declines at McDonald's, which is battling changing consumer tastes, tough U.S. competition, the after-effects of a supplier scandal in Asia and economic and political turmoil in Europe.Worldwide sales at restaurants open at least 13 months were down 2.2 percent last month, more than the 1.7 percent decline analysts expected, according to Consensus Metrix.Shares in McDonald's fell 3.8 percent to $92.69 in afternoon trading.Chief Executive Officer Don Thompson, who took the helm in July 2012, has shaken up management and is giving more power to local operators in a bid to improve results. Despite that, U.S. sales at restaurants open at least 13 months tumbled 4.6 percent in November, the biggest monthly decline since June 2001. Analysts, on average, expected a 1.9 percent fall.  McDonald's U.S. same-restaurant sales have not increased since October 2013, in part due to competition from smaller and more nimble direct rivals ranging from Wendy's Co (WEN.O) and Burger King Worldwide Inc BKW.N to In-N-Out Burger and Chick-fil-A. It is localizing U.S. menus and focusing on customization and fresh ingredients as it also seeks to better compete with popular chains like Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (CMG.N) and Subway, where diners pick the ingredients that go into their meals. The stronger U.S. dollar also is expected to reduce fourth-quarter profit by as much as 9 cents per share, McDonald's said on Monday.November same-restaurant sales fell 4 percent in the Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa (APMEA), which has not yet recovered from a China meat supplier scandal that drove away diners and sent restaurants scrambling for new sources of ingredients for its Chicken McNuggets and Big Macs.  The company said the weak APMEA results could cut McDonald's profits by as much as 10 cents a share in the current quarter that ends on Dec. 31.Europe's same-restaurant sales were down 2 percent in November, hurt by ""very weak"" results from Russia as well as declines in France and Germany. McDonald's said on Monday that all restaurants closed for as long as three months by Russian officials had been reopened.

Data showed China's exports grew at a slower-than-expected pace and imports dropped in November, while Japan's economy shrank more than expected in the third quarter. The S&P energy index tumbled 3.9 percent and traded at its lowest since June 2013 as Brent crude fell to a five-year low on predictions oversupply would keep building until next year.

The S&P 500 is up 11.5 percent for the year so far.Most growth-oriented sectors also fell, suggesting investors were avoiding riskier areas of the market.

Among them, Apple was down 2.3 percent at $112.40, while GoPro shares fell 6.3 percent at $67.65.""This has been a monster market, and it's been eking out new records. So it's taking a breather. The question is, is the U.S. equities versus other asset classes trade done,"" said Uri Landesman, president of Platinum Partners in New York.The Dow Jones industrial average fell 106.31 points, or 0.59 percent, to 17,852.48, the S&P 500 lost 15.06 points, or 0.73 percent, to 2,060.31 and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 40.06 points, or 0.84 percent, to 4,740.69.

249,"  When it comes to No. 1 Kentucky and its roster loaded with former McDonald's All-Americans, the only question is which one of their stars will dominate on a nightly basis. On Sunday, it was Karl-Anthony Towns, who scored a career-high 19 points while adding nine rebounds and four blocks in a lopsided win over Eastern Kentucky. The freshman forward looks to score in double figures for the fifth straight game Wednesday when the Wildcats host Columbia.Kentucky needs to make sure it focuses on the Lions despite games looming against North Carolina, UCLA and Louisville later this month. Columbia likely will have its hands full with the Wildcats' length, as their average height (6 feet, 10.14 inches) is taller than every NBA team except the Portland Trail Blazers. The Lions are coming off perhaps their best game of the season - a 23-point victory against Bucknell on Saturday.TV: 7 p.m. ET, ESPN2 ABOUT COLUMBIA (5-2): The Lions are not a particularly good shooting team in any respect, although Maodo Lo has knocked down a team-high 16 3-pointers en route to a team-leading 16.1 scoring average. He scored 20 points on 4-of-6 3-point shooting against Bucknell as the Lions connected on 10-of-22 3-pointers as a team. Cory Osetkowski also had a big game against the Bison, posting 12 points, 12 rebounds, six assists and three blocks.ABOUT KENTUCKY (9-0): The key to the Wildcats' success - besides the overwhelming talent on their roster - has been a defense that has given up more than 52 points only once in nine games. They held Eastern Kentucky to 14 first-half points and 26.1 percent shooting overall while outrebounding the Colonels by 20. “It shows that we are focused after a big win against Texas,"" said another one of the Wildcats' star freshmen, Trey Lyles, who had 10 points and 10 rebounds for his first career double-double. ""We can come out and keep our mindset, which is winning.” TIP-INS 1. Lo has 20 steals this season - one more than all of his teammates combined. 2.

251,"   By Daniel Wiessner  McDonald's Corp and some of its franchisees were named jointly in complaints filed on Friday by the U.S. National Labor Relations Board's Office of the General Counsel, accusing them of labor violations in a widely anticipated move that could have wide-reaching implications for businesses.Complaints were filed in 78 cases claiming that McDonald's workers across the country were fired or intimidated for participating in union organizing and in a national protest movement calling for higher wages.The complaints strike new ground in treating McDonald's, the world's largest restaurant chain, as a ""joint employer,"" meaning that it could be held liable along with its franchisees for any violations, the NLRB's general counsel, Richard Griffin, said in a release.Until now, McDonald's and other companies that make wide use of franchises and contract employers have been insulated from such liability under the NLRB's previous definition of what constituted a joint employer.A McDonald's spokeswoman said the company and franchisees would fight the claims. ""These allegations are driven in large part by a two-year, union-financed campaign that has targeted the McDonald's brand and impacted McDonald's restaurants,"" said Lisa McComb, a company spokeswoman.The complaints will be considered by administrative law judges beginning in March 2015; the decisions can be appealed to the five-member NLRB and ultimately to federal courts.While Friday's move was the first step in a long process, it has the potential to rewrite long-held rules governing labor relations between parent companies and franchises that are run as independent businesses. For the last three decades, the NLRB has held that franchisers may only be considered joint employers if they are involved in setting wages and hiring workers.Mary Joyce Carlson, counsel for the Fast Food Workers Organizing Committee, the union-backed group behind the protest movement, said Griffin was right to treat McDonald's as a joint employer because of the control it exerts over franchises, including the way food is prepared and served.Trade groups said the decision to treat McDonald's as a joint employer would lead to uncertainty about how employment agreements are enforced and when companies can be sued for labor violations.

Complaints were filed in 78 cases claiming that McDonald's workers across the country were fired or intimidated for participating in union organizing and in a national protest movement calling for higher wages.The complaints strike new ground in treating McDonald's, the world's largest restaurant chain, as a ""joint employer,"" meaning that it could be held liable along with its franchisees for any violations, the NLRB's general counsel, Richard Griffin, said in a release.Until now, McDonald’s and other companies that make wide use of franchises and contract employers have been insulated from such liability under the NLRB’s previous definition of what constituted a joint employer.A McDonald's spokeswoman said the company and franchisees would fight the claims.""These allegations are driven in large part by a two-year, union-financed campaign that has targeted the McDonald’s brand and impacted McDonald’s restaurants,"" said Lisa McComb, a company spokeswoman. The complaints will be considered by administrative law judges beginning in March 2015; the decisions can be appealed to the five-member NLRB and ultimately to federal courts.While Friday's move was the first step in a long process, it has the potential to rewrite long-held rules governing labor relations between parent companies and franchises that are run as independent businesses.For the last three decades, the NLRB has held that franchisers may only be considered joint employers if they are involved in setting wages and hiring workers.  Mary Joyce Carlson, counsel for the Fast Food Workers Organizing Committee, the union-backed group behind the protest movement, said Griffin was right to treat McDonald's as a joint employer because of the control it exerts over franchises, including the way food is prepared and served.

255,"  TOKYO Dec 26 McDonald's customers in Japan will be able to order french fries in all sizes again from next month, after the fast-food chain limited sales to small servings because of import delays.McDonald's Holdings Co (Japan) Ltd said on Friday it will resume sales of medium- and large-size french fries on Jan. 5, as it has secured enough inventory thanks to emergency measures.The company, owned 49.9 percent by McDonald's Corp, began restricting serving sizes on Dec. 17 after a labour dispute at U.S. West Coast ports led to delays in imports. As an emergency step, McDonald's Japan said earlier this month that it was importing over 1,000 tonnes of frozen fries by air, and another 1,600 tonnes by ship from ports on the U.S. East Coast.The fry rationing capped off a tough year for McDonald's Japan: the company in October forecast its first annual loss in 11 years as sales slid following a food safety scandal at the Chinese supplier of chicken for its McNuggets. Sales at outlets open at least a year fell 12 percent in November, down for the 10th month in a row. McDonald's Japan said it continues to face import delays as the port labour dispute drags on. It said it will monitor the situation closely and do its best to offer a stable supply of fries.A company spokesman declined to comment on the fry shortage's impact on earnings.

She said the firm had not reached any conclusions. ""We want to investigate what caused the labelling issue and whether or not it was the action of a single franchised outlet."" The issue highlights the difficulty firms have to control food quality and safety in supply chains and outlets in China, which can cause serious headaches with regulators and hit sales.Earlier this year, a China-based food supplier to McDonald's Corp and Yum Brands Inc was caught up in a scandal over workers allegedly tampering with expiry dates, which pummelled China sales at the fast-food chains. The Subway spokeswoman said the firm sent teams to inspect its franchises around the country each month and that it gave staff training on food safety and handling produce. The Beijing food regulator had also launched an investigation, she added.Food safety scandals in China are all too common, including recycled ""gutter oil"" for cooking, donkey meat products tainted with fox and one in 2008 involving tainted dairy products that led to the deaths of at least six infants.Subway, part of Doctor's Associate Inc, has close to 500 outlets in China, according to its official website.

259,"   By Chris Gallagher | TOKYO  TOKYO McDonald's Japan (2702.T) has apologized to customers and vowed to ensure product safety after objects including a tooth and plastic were found in its food, the latest trouble for a fast-food chain hit by sliding sales and a shortage of french fries.The chain, 49.9 percent-owned by McDonald's Corp (MCD.N), has been grappling with falling sales that began long before a food safety scandal last summer hit confidence in its products. Convenience stores in particular have drawn away customers with broader ranges of ready-made meals and low-priced coffee.McDonald's Japan brought in Chief Executive Sarah Casanova last March to reverse the trend, but the company is still on track to record its sixth straight year of sales declines and its first annual loss in 11 years.Wednesday's apology came after a diner found a roughly 4 cm (1 1/2 inch) strip of vinyl in a Chicken McNugget at the weekend. That prompted the chain to halt sales of nuggets made on the same day as the contaminated item at a plant in Thailand. The company is still investigating the cause.Among other incidents, a human tooth was found in a customer's french fry in August, while a child in December cut his mouth on a piece of plastic that was in a chocolate sundae. At a packed news conference, executives sought to reassure the public of the safety of McDonald's food.""I am confident that my family can eat McDonald's products,"" said Takehiko Aoki, senior vice president at McDonald's Holding Co (Japan) Ltd. ""I think our response has been appropriate,"" he said when questioned on whether the company had been slow to announce its findings, explaining that the handling of each case is different.McDonald's Japan only started sourcing nuggets from three Thai plants less than six months ago. The change was aimed at boosting confidence in product quality after Chinese supplier Shanghai Husi Food Co Ltd was accused of selling expired meat.The Thai plant that produced the nugget found to contain vinyl is located in Saraburi, owned by Cargill, McDonald's Japan said. Cargill Thailand was not immediately available for comment. On Monday, just days after the latest discovery, McDonald's Japan resumed sales of all sizes of french fries for the first time in three weeks. A labor dispute at U.S. West Coast ports had delayed imports, forcing the company to ration portions.McDonald's Japan shares closed down 0.9 percent on Wednesday versus a 0.3 percent rise in the Jasdaq index .JSD.

260,"   By Adam Jourdan | SHANGHAI  SHANGHAI Jan 7 U.S. food supplier OSI Group LLC, which came under fire in China last year over allegations it used out-of-date meat, has criticised the handling of the case by the local food regulator, a rare act in China where firms are usually careful not to openly challenge the authorities.OSI's Shanghai Husi Food Co Ltd plant came under the spotlight in July when an undercover Chinese media report showed workers using out-of-date meat and doctoring production dates.The firm, which supplied international fast food chains including McDonald's Corp and Yum Brands Inc, launched a sweeping recall last summer that culminated on Sunday when it said it had destroyed the products.The Shanghai Food and Drug Administration, which is still investigating Shanghai Husi over the matter, called the food destroyed on Sunday ""questionable"" in a routine statement, prompting the strong objections from OSI. ""Without having any test results or even having done any testing on the relevant products, and with the case still under investigation, to define the products our company has voluntarily recalled as ""questionable"" ... is totally without factual, scientific or legal foundation,"" Shanghai Husi said in a statement in Chinese on the OSI China website.The statement said Chinese rules defined ""questionable"" food products as those which did not meet food safety standards or could be harmful for human health. OSI's criticism escalated a rare war of words between a foreign company and Chinese regulators, who over the past year have closely scrutinized international firms in industries ranging from automobiles to high tech.Microsoft Corp, for instance, has expressed deference to Chinese anti-monopoly regulators looking into its software sales practices -- even while U.S. business lobbies have complained about their companies being unfairly targeted. OSI's tussle with its Shanghai regulator also comes at a time when the central government in Beijing has acknowledged China's struggles to regulate tainted products.China's top food watchdog said on Wednesday food and drug safety in the country was ""grim"" and pledged stronger oversight in the wake of a string of food scandals which have hit the reputations of brands including McDonald's, Yum and retailers Carrefour SA and Wal-Mart Stores Inc.The Shanghai Husi scandal, which spread as far as Hong Kong and Japan, sparked a Chinese probe into the firm and dragged down Chinese sales at KFC-parent Yum and McDonald's. Both have since cut or suspended ties with Aurora, Illinois-based OSI.

The quality of personnel, legal structures, management methods and technological aspects were all currently insufficient, it said. Regulators overseeing the country's food industry are thinly stretched, company executives told Reuters, and inspectors often struggle to deal with China's fragmented food supply chains.The regulator said China would look to attract more personnel, standardize training methods and promote greater cooperation between regions.

269,"   By Lisa Baertlein and Yashaswini Swamynathan  McDonald's Corp (MCD.N) warned on Friday that business will be weak in the first half of 2015 and it is cutting its annual construction budget to the lowest in more than five years as it opens fewer restaurants in struggling markets.The world's largest fast-food chain, with more than 36,000 restaurants around the globe, just finished one of its toughest years in decades. It struggled to recover from a food scare in China that battered Asian sales and wrestled with economic weakness and political upheaval in Europe, its top revenue market. The company also lost market share to rivals in the United States, where its image has been dented by frequent protests from workers seeking higher wages.Sales at established restaurants, a closely watched gauge of performance also known as comparable sales, fell during the fourth quarter and for all of 2014. Revenue and net income suffered the same fates. Chief Executive Officer Don Thompson, who took the helm in July 2012 and is under pressure to turn the business around, said he expected the trend to continue as McDonald's works to make the business to be more nimble and responsive to customers. ""January comparable sales are expected to be negative and results are expected to remain pressured, particularly in the first half of the year,"" Thompson said in a statement.The company, trying to find the right recipe for diners' growing appetite for healthier and fresher food, is trimming complicated menus, giving more control back to restaurant operators and testing customized burgers and sandwiches to compete with popular restaurants like Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (CMG.N) and Subway. Fourth-quarter net income dropped 21 percent to $1.1 billion, or $1.13 per share, while revenue fell more than 7 percent to $6.57 billion.

278,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, January 29 (Fitch) Trending much wider since last year, credit default  swap (CDS) spreads for McDonald's Corporation could actually reverse course in  light of some surprising news today, according to Fitch Solutions in its latest  CDS Case Study Snapshot. Five-year CDS on McDonald's have been trending wider since September 2014 and  are now 142% wider compared levels seen this time last year.  After pricing  historically in-line with 'AAA' levels, the cost of credit protection on  McDonald's debt is now pricing in 'A+' space. 'Growing market concerns over  McDonald's credit prospects are likely attributed to the company's sluggish  sales and profitability,' said Director Diana Allmendinger.   That said, McDonald's CDS have tightened modestly over the past week ahead of  today's announcement that their Chief Executive Officer is stepping down and  being replaced by the Chief Branding Officer.  'Today's news could potentially  be perceived by the market as a positive step towards modifying McDonald's  strategy,' said Allmendinger.  Fitch Solutions case studies build on data from its CDS Pricing Service and  proprietary quantitative models, including CDS Implied Ratings. These credit  risk indicators are designed to provide real-time, market-based views of  creditworthiness. As such, they can and often do reflect more short term market  views on factors such as currencies, seasonal market effects and short-term  technical influences. This is in contrast to Fitch Ratings' Issuer Default  Ratings (IDRs), which are based on forward-looking fundamental credit analysis  over an extended period of time.

279,"   By Anjali Athavaley  McDonald's Corp (MCD.N), fresh off one of its worst financial years in decades, on Wednesday said Chief Executive Officer Don Thompson would leave at the end of February and be succeeded by Chief Brand Officer Steve Easterbrook.Shares in the world's biggest fast-food chain, which have been underperforming major markets and several peers, jumped 3.2 percent in extended trading following the news.Thompson, the 51-year-old former president of McDonald's USA who took the global helm in July 2012, had the challenge of adding to nearly nine years of sales gains at established restaurants.But the following September, McDonald's reported a decline in same-store sales as it fought to hold on to customers with changing tastes amid external pressures ranging from political and economic turmoil in Europe to food safety scares in China. ""I don't think it was too much of a surprise. Maybe in the timing but not the action,"" Sanford Bernstein analyst Sara Senatore said. ""This has been something that people have been talking about for a while."" McDonald's warned last week that business would be weak in the first half of 2015 and said it would cut its annual construction budget to the lowest in more than five years as it opens fewer restaurants in struggling markets.In his role as chief brand officer, Easterbrook led McDonald's digital initiatives and efforts to boost menu innovation, according to a statement from the company.

According to a 2008 story in the Guardian, that business was stalling in the early 2000s, but it had a strong run under Easterbrook, who took over as CEO in 2006 and refocused on the core business of selling hamburgers.    “The UK has been a good market for them for a long time, but it wasn’t always,” Senatore said. “He played a role in the turnaround.”The question is can he turn around the company’s brand, particularly in the United States where it is losing share to rivals such as Five Guys Burgers and Fries, Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG.N) and other smaller, regional food outlets which are seen as offering fresher and higher quality products. Easterbrook has experience leading other restaurant chains. In 2011, he left McDonald's and ran two UK-based restaurant chains, PizzaExpress LTD, a British chain which markets itself on quality and freshness, and later, Wagamama Ltd, a pan-Asian restaurant chain modeled on Japanese ramen bars.

282,"   By Lisa Baertlein | LOS ANGELES  LOS ANGELES McDonald's Corp (MCD.N) franchisees have an urgent order for the fast-food giant's new CEO - get back-to-basics. In interviews, franchisees and advisors to restaurant owners say they hope the new chief will shrink its huge menu to concentrate on burgers and fries. McDonald's on Wednesday said Chief Brand Officer Steve Easterbrook would replace Don Thompson as chief executive after he had held the post just two and a half years. Easterbrook, 47, turned around McDonald's operations in the UK, where he was born, by refocusing on burgers and burnishing the brand with an ad campaign that sought to debunk unflattering rumors about its food, the company said. A cricket enthusiast who earned a reputation among former UK colleagues for being funny, fair and a lover of simplicity, Easterbrook will also be the rare McDonald's CEO with experience running other restaurant chains.   ""I will be very curious to see if this new guy continues on with what Thompson has been doing ... or if he will put some new ideas in. I'm very hopeful,"" said Kathryn Slater-Carter, who operates one of McDonald's restaurants in Daly City, California.She declined to elaborate.The world's largest restaurant chain by sales has more than 36,000 restaurants around the globe. Revenue, net income and traffic all fell in 2014, as it struggled to appeal to younger and more upscale diners who demand fresher, healthier fare.During the last few years, McDonald's has expanded menus to broaden appeal. While that effort initially boosted sales, franchisees now blame sprawling menus for slowing service and are calling on the chain to dump menu items ranging from espresso to McWraps.Thompson had moved to trim McDonald's menu, but franchisees have said they want bigger changes, faster.Even so, some skeptics questioned whether Easterbrook, an insider with some two decades at the chain who takes the helm on March 1, is the right person to make the tough decisions needed to fix what ails the company.  GLOBAL CHOPS Supporters find hope that fact that from 2011 to 2013, Easterbrook ran PizzaExpress, a British chain that markets itself on quality and freshness, and then became CEO at Wagamama, a Japanese-inspired noodle chain, before returning to McDonald's to oversee marketing, menus and technology.Easterbrook's global chops may come in handy as the chain fights to recover from a food scare in China that battered Asian sales and wrestles with economic weakness and political upheaval in Europe, its top revenue market. Its image in the United States is also getting a drubbing from McDonald's burger flippers, who have held frequent protests calling for higher wages.Richard Adams, a former McDonald's franchisee who now consults current ones, said most U.S. McDonald's owners don't have personal experience with Easterbrook but that they are ""cautiously optimistic"" about his appointment. Those same franchisees had a rough ride under Thompson.Monthly sales at established U.S. restaurants increased in just 12 of the 30 months he has held the top job.   McDonald's attempted to stem market share losses to smaller and more nimble rivals ranging from Wendy's Co (WEN.O) and Burger King to Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG.N), Chic-fil-A  and Five Guys Burgers and Fries with frequent specials and giveaways. Shares in burger chain Shake Shack Inc (SHAK.N) more than doubled in its first day of trading on Friday, in a pointed contrast with the lackluster performance of McDonald's, whose shares are down 1.3 percent over the past year.While discounting helped the parent company, which gets franchise royalties based on revenues, they squeezed the franchisee profits. Beyond that, a push to rebuild or remodel restaurants burdened many franchisees with debt but didn't always deliver a pop in sales. 'CHORUS OF NO'S'  Adams said morale among U.S. franchisees is at the lowest point since the late 1990s, when overbuilding hurt franchisees. ""Made For You"", a 90s-era burger customization program that required investments of around $55,000 per outlet, made matters worse by battering service speed and sales, Adams said. Thompson revived bad memories of that era with a project called ""Create Your Taste,"" which he said would succeed where ""Made for You"" had failed due to improved technology. While Thompson said the plan would allow McDonald's to become more like Chipotle and Subway by letting customers select sandwich toppings, Adams said franchisees aren't buying in. Their reaction to the plan, he said, has been ""A chorus of No's."" While most franchisees are reluctant to speak to the press, they offered blunt recommendations in a survey published earlier this month by Janney Capital Markets analyst Mark Kalinowski. Change is ""moving too slow, let's bite the bullet,"" one survey respondent said. They suggested dropping McCafe espresso drinks, which critics say don't sell enough to pay for the electricity used by the machines that make them. Thompson spearheaded McDonald's domestic McCafe expansion during his stint as head of the U.S. business. They also want to cut the number of Happy Meal options, to get rid of the hard-to-make McWraps and other poorly performing menu items, and to eliminate redundant items such as the McDouble and Double Cheeseburger.""We just have no momentum any more,"" one franchisee said.

Given the current conditions of doing business in Russia ... we are pleased that the investment resources we have been allocated remained at last year's level,"" he said on Saturday.The U.S. fast-food chain, which has been operating in Russia for 25 years, was hit by a string of snap inspections by a state regulator last year, which were widely seen as retaliation for the West's sanctions against Moscow over its role in the Ukraine crisis. Those inspections led to temporary closures of 12 restaurants, including the world's busiest on the Pushkin square in Moscow.Khasbulatov said the company had taken advantage of some of the closures to modernize the restaurants. All have reopened but their sales have yet to catch up with pre-closure levels. The unexpected scrutiny had not led McDonald's to changing its attitude towards the market, Khasbulatov said.""New restaurants must meet our profitability expectations. (Fewer openings) is only a question of having a healthy business,"" he said.He added same-store sales growth could fall to zero in 2015 because of high inflation and an expected decline in spending on eating out, but new openings should help grow overall sales.

289,"   By Thomas Wilson | TOKYO  TOKYO The Japanese unit of McDonald's Corp (MCD.N) is likely to post a second straight year of losses in 2015 as it grapples with the fallout from food safety scandals and a french fry shortage, exacerbating headaches for a global brand struggling to appeal to consumers.McDonald's Holdings Co (Japan) Ltd (2702.T), which operates the fast food chain's second-largest restaurant network in the world, has already flagged an annual loss for 2014, its first since it listed in 2001. It reports earnings on Thursday and is expected to give forecasts for this year.With same-store sales sliding in Japan, analysts said they don't expect a quick turnaround in a country where consumers are highly attuned to food quality issues.""First they have to regain consumer trust, even if it costs a lot. After that they need to focus on developing a menu that is clear and easy to understand,"" said Kyoichiro Shigemura, an analyst at Nomura Securities. The problems are an added distraction for McDonald's Corp, the world's largest restaurant chain by sales, which last month replaced its CEO with Chief Brand Officer Steve Easterbrook following one of its worst financial years in decades. McDonald's Japan in October forecast a 17 billion yen ($145 million) annual net loss after a major Chinese supplier of chicken was found to have been in breach of food safety standards.That is likely to widen after the company was forced to temporarily ration fries due to labor disputes at U.S. West Coast ports and take the costly step of shipping some by air. Same-store sales dropped by a fifth in December from a year earlier.Food safety issues arose again last month with the news that customers had found foreign objects, including a tooth, in McDonald's Japan food - only boding ill for its outlook for this year. ""It will take time for the company to recover trust,"" said Seiichiro Samejima of Ichiyoshi Research Institute, who sees a return to profit in 2016. The problems at McDonald's Japan prompted Chief Executive Sarah Casanova last month to shift oversight of the supply chain to the chief financial officer. The company has also since announced new measures that will see third-party inspections of its kitchens.Increased competition is also a concern. Like the United States, McDonald's Japan faces upmarket rivals that promote an image of fresher and more carefully prepared food.

299,"   By Svea Herbst-Bayliss | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Feb 12 Hedge fund manager Larry Robbins on Thursday called fast food restaurant McDonald's Corp  a ""uniquely interesting opportunity"" thanks to a new chief executive and a board that he expects will become more focused over the coming months.Robbins, who runs the $11 billion Glenview Capital Management hedge fund and was ranked as 2013's best performing hedge fund manager, listed McDonald's as one of his portfolio's lesser-known favorite picks - placing it alongside his more-widely-discussed favorites Thermo Fisher, Monsanto  and Flextronics.Robbins attends many conferences and talks often about his top picks. At the Harbor Investment Conference he joked that he's talked about everything. McDonald's operating characteristics are ""subpar,"" he said, but he thinks Steve Easterbrook, who will take over the CEO role on March 1, is aware of this and will work on it.He also said that nominations for directors to McDonald's board can be made, which suggests that new members might join.  ""At a minimum, the board will be more focused,"" Robbins said. Robbins also said that the fund had trimmed its investments in hospital-sector companies going into the end of 2014. He did not elaborate on why. At the end of the third quarter, Tenet Healthcare Corp  was one of his biggest investments.Generally, Robbins, whose Capital Opportunity Fund gained an average 57 percent a year over the last three years, said he likes to pick business sectors where companies allocate capital well rather than trying to pick individual winners and losers.Robbins was being interviewed about his favorite picks by William Ackman, the best hedge fund manager of 2014. Ackman and Mark Axelowitz, a managing director at UBS Private Wealth Management, run the conference.

The union pension funds that CtW advises hold a small percentage of McDonald's outstanding shares that are worth $268 million.CtW Executive Director Dieter Waizenegger, in a letter addressed to board Chairman Andrew McKenna and Governance Committee Chairman Miles White, said the replacement of Thompson fell short of what is required to fix the world's biggest restaurant chain by revenue.""Returning McDonald's Corp to a path of long-term, profitable growth requires that Mr. Steven Easterbrook's appointment as CEO is followed by a robust refreshment of the board's membership and leadership,"" Waizenegger wrote in the letter, which was obtained by Reuters.McDonald's did not immediately respond to requests for comment. McDonald's, which recently reported one of its worst years in decades, has suffered eight straight months of worldwide same-restaurant sales declines. It is editing bloated menus, experimenting with technology and revamping its advertising to appeal to diners, who increasingly are demanding fresher, healthier food.McDonald's board, which consists of many long-term and Chicago-area directors, has failed to evolve with the global company's changing circumstances, Waizenegger said.    ""We believe it is critical for McDonald's to have strong, independent board leadership. Fresh eyes are essential,"" said Waizenegger. He took particular aim at McKenna, an octogenarian who has been McDonald's non-executive chairman since April 2004 and a director since 1991. While Waizenegger conceded that the recent addition of Google Inc executive Margo Georgiadis to the McDonald's board was a positive, he called on the company to announce plans that include a board succession strategy ""that will, by the time of the annual shareholder meeting, have prompted both board arrivals and departures.""    CtW, which advises funds holding nearly 3 million McDonald's shares, unsuccessfully lobbied investors at last year's annual meeting to vote against the pay package for CEO Thompson. Some unions have helped organize fast-food workers in a nationwide campaign that seeks to roughly double their hourly wage to $15.

303,"  (Updates with details on sales growth, McDonald's context, market reaction)By Solarina HoTORONTO Feb 17 Restaurant Brands International Inc, the parent of Burger King and Canadian coffee and doughnut chain Tim Hortons, reported robust quarterly sales growth on Tuesday, crediting new menu items for driving traffic.Shares of the Oakville, Ontario-based company, which have soared more than 40 percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange since being listed in December, jumped another 10.1 percent on Tuesday to C$53.14.The stock rose even though the company, which opened nearly 900 new restaurants in 2014, posted a hefty quarterly loss on one-time merger-related costs.U.S. chain Burger King bought Tim Hortons for C$12.64 billion ($10.21 billion) in August, creating the world's third-largest fast-food restaurant group. The two chains are managed as separate brands under the parent company. Investors are keen to see if Tim's dominance in the Canadian coffee market can help chip away at McDonald's Corp's  leadership in the U.S. quick-serve breakfast market.Restaurant Brands executives credited new menu items like Burger King's A1 ultimate bacon cheeseburger and Tim Horton's dark roast blend coffee for helping drive sales gains in the quarter.The results contrasted with those of McDonald's, which has been fighting to win back customers and reported one of its worst years in decades with eight straight months of global same-restaurant sales declines. Comparable store sales grew 4.1 percent at Tim Hortons and 3 percent at Burger King in the quarter, Restaurant Brands said. On a constant currency basis, system-wide sales grew 7.4 percent at Tim Hortons and 7.7 percent at Burger King.Last month, the company cut some 350 corporate jobs at Tim Hortons as part of the post-merger reorganization. ""We executed our organizational restructuring up front, which really focused on back office, corporate areas where we said we'd see overlap in the business,"" Chief Executive Daniel Schwartz told Reuters. ""We have no plans to have any more job cuts.""Executives said they would focus on deleveraging and reinvesting in the business. Tim Hortons' U.S and international growth would be a top priority, but something that would take time, they added.Restaurant Brands, which has more than 19,000 restaurants in 100 countries, posted a net loss attributable to shareholders of $514.2 million, or $2.52 per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, in its first quarterly results after the merger.The company reported total revenue of $416.3 million in the quarter.($1 = 1.2374 Canadian dollars)   (With additional reporting by Sneha Banerjee in Bengaluru; Editing by Simon Jennings and Meredith Mazzilli)",2015-02-17,MCD,"Tue Feb 17, 2015 | 2:48pm EST","UPDATE 4-New menu items help drive Burger King, Tim Hortons sales jump",http://www.reuters.com//article/restaurant-brand-results-idUSL4N0VR3LR20150217?type=companyNews

311,"   By Abhishek Vishnoi and Nivedita Bhattacharjee | MUMBAI  MUMBAI Feb 27 The firm behind Cafe Coffee Day, India's biggest homegrown coffee chain, is set for a market debut that could value it at almost $1 billion, even as the country's burgeoning cafe culture draws global giants Starbucks  and McDonald's.Cafe Coffee Day, a cafe pioneer in India, aims to list a 20 percent stake, raising roughly $200 million, within the next quarter, sources with direct knowledge of the plans said.It has hired investment banks Kotak Mahindra Capital and Citigroup among other advisors and plans to file for the listing by the end of April, the sources said.Cafe Coffee Day, Citi and Kotak did not respond to requests for comment.India's biggest cafe operator opened its first shop in 1996 and has grown to more than 1,500 outlets as more young, urban consumers opt for cappuccino over tea and seek out spaces to socialise in overcrowded, traffic-congested cities. The IPO comes as India's sluggish economy is showing signs of life, fuelling hopes of a consumer spending recovery that has boosted shares in food chain operators such as Jubilant Foodworks Ltd, which owns the Domino's Pizza franchise in India.Jubilant shares are up 20 percent this year and trade at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 62.5 times, nearly 4 times the average across the NSE shares index. India's cafe market is worth 18.2 billion rupees and is growing at 20 percent annually, according to estimates by consultancy Technopak.""This company would see heavy interest from investors given it's a play on the high potential Indian consumer sector, and due to a revival in the Indian IPO market,"" said Nirakar Pradhan, chief investment officer at Future Generali India Life Insurance.Still, the chain faces competition from global rivals that have already edged out some peers. Italy's Lavazza in August announced plans to pull out of the cafe business in India by selling its Barista chain. Tata Starbucks Ltd, a joint venture between the Seattle-based chain and India's Tata Global Beverages Ltd , has opened 68 shops across India in the past two years.""Starbucks has been looking at India for 10 years now, but only got in two years ago. They have to make up for lost time,"" said Harminder Sahni of retail consulting firm Wazir Advisors.Meanwhile, Hardcastle Restaurants, one of two McDonald's franchises in India, plans to have 50-75 McCafes by the end of the year, up from its current 30.($1 = 61.9807 Indian rupees)   (Editing by Clara Ferreira Marques and Jason Neely)",2015-02-27,MCD,"Fri Feb 27, 2015 | 7:21am EST",Coffee's hot as IPO could value India's Cafe Coffee Day at $1 bln,http://www.reuters.com//article/india-cafecoffeeday-ipo-idUSL5N0W05Z920150227?type=companyNews
312,"  (Adds detail on why chicken producers use antibiotics)By Lisa Baertlein and P.J. HuffstutterLOS ANGELES/CHICAGO March 4 McDonald's Corp's  U.S. restaurants will gradually stop buying chicken raised with antibiotics vital to fighting human infections, the most aggressive step by a major food company to change chicken producers' practices in the fight against dangerous 'superbugs.'The world's biggest restaurant chain announced on Wednesday that within two years, McDonald's USA will only buy chickens raised without antibiotics that are important to human medicine. The concern is that the overuse of antibiotics for poultry may diminish their effectiveness in fighting disease in humans. McDonald's policy will begin at the hatchery, where chicks are sometimes injected with antibiotics while still in the shell.""We're listening to our customers,"" Marion Gross, senior vice president of McDonald's North American supply chain, told Reuters. She said the company is working with its domestic chicken suppliers, including Tyson Foods Inc, to make the transition.Veterinary use of antibiotics is legal. However, as the rate of human infections from antibiotic-resistant bacteria increases, consumer advocates and public health experts have become more critical of the practice of routinely feeding antibiotics to chickens, cattle and pigs.Scientists and public health experts say whenever an antibiotic is administered, it kills weaker bacteria and can enable the strongest to survive and multiply. Frequent use of low-dose antibiotics, a practice used by some meat producers, can intensify that effect. The risk, they say, is that so-called superbugs might develop cross-resistance to critical, medically important antibiotics.Superbugs are linked to an estimated 23,000 human deaths and 2 million illnesses every year in the United States, and up to $20 billion in direct healthcare costs, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Poultry producers began using antibiotics in the 1940s, not long after scientists discovered that penicillin, streptomycin and chlortetracycline helped control outbreaks of disease in chickens. The drugs offered an added benefit: They kept the birds' digestive tracts healthy, and chickens were able to gain more weight without eating more food.Gross said McDonald's expects its suppliers will treat any animals that become ill, using antibiotics when prescribed. McDonald's, however, will not buy those treated chickens, she said.The poultry industry's lobby takes issue with the concerns of government and academic scientists, saying there is little evidence that bacteria which do become resistant also infect people.This may be a ""tipping point for antibiotic use in the poultry industry,"" said Jonathan Kaplan, the Natural Resources Defense Council's food and agriculture program director. ""McDonald's has so much purchasing power and brand recognition, I think we're seeing a new industry standard here,"" Kaplan said.""For public health, this is really a game changer,"" said Gail Hansen, a senior officer for Pew Charitable Trusts' antibiotic resistance project.There are exceptions to McDonald's new policy. The company will buy chicken from farmers who ""responsibly use"" ionophores, an animal antibiotic not used in human medical treatment, Gross said.The phase-out applies only to McDonald's roughly 14,000 U.S. restaurants. It currently does not affect the company's approximately 22,000 international restaurants. The action by McDonald's, which has been fighting to win back diners and bolster sagging U.S. sales, is in step with consumer demand for food made with 'clean' and more 'natural' ingredients. But it falls short of similar policies at smaller  chains such as Chipotle Mexican Grill and Panera Bread Co, which ban the use of ionophores.Tyson, the largest U.S. meat processor, told Reuters in a statement it supported McDonald's decision and that its chicken operations have reduced the use of antibiotics that are effective in humans by more than 84 percent since 2011. The company expects to continue reductions.A Reuters investigation last year revealed that some of the nation's largest poultry producers routinely fed chickens an array of antibiotics, not just when sickness strikes, but as a standard practice over most of the birds' lives.The Reuters report also found that low doses of antibiotics were part of the standard diet for some of Tyson's flocks, including two internal company documents showing the use of bacitracin. Though that drug is not classified as medically important by the federal Food and Drug Administration, bacitracin is commonly used to prevent human skin infections.Tyson said it disagreed with the findings of the Reuters investigation but has since taken further steps to reduce or halt antibiotic use, including in its chicken hatcheries.(Reporting by Lisa Baertlein in Los Angeles and P.J.

313,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, March 04 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the Issuer Default Ratings  (IDRs) of McDonald's Corporation (NYSE: MCD) at 'A/F1'. The Rating Outlook has  been revised to Negative from Stable.  At Dec. 31, 2014, McDonald's had approximately $15 billion of total debt. A full  list of ratings is provided at the end of this release. Negative Outlook: The Outlook revision is due to persistently weak global same-store sales (SSS),  declining store-level profitability, and increased leverage. Global SSS were  negative 1% in 2014, after being flat at 0.2% in 2013, with guest counts  declining 1.9% in 2013 and 3.6% in 2014. Consolidated company-operated  restaurant margin contracted 160 basis points to 15.9% in 2014, continuing a  multi-year decline that began in 2010. Lastly, total debt/EBITDA and total  adjusted debt/EBITDAR were 1.5x and 2.6x, respectively, at Dec. 31, 2014 up from  1.4x and 2.4x in 2013. Fitch's current rating incorporated that total debt/EBITDA and total adjusted  debt/EBITDA (rent-adjusted leverage) would approximate 1.5x and 2.5x,  respectively, while considering McDonald's leading global market position, brand  strength, system health, and significant financial flexibility. However, recent  SSS trends, market share losses, and the decline in operating income results in  little room for further downside. The modest increase in leverage during 2014 was due to an 8% decline in constant  currency operating income and $1.5 billion of incremental debt to help fund the  company's $18 - $20 billion three-year cash shareholder return target. Fitch's  base case projection is that total debt/EBITDA and rent-adjusted leverage will  increase to 1.6x and 2.7x, respectively, in 2015 and 2016 due to flat SSS,  limited operating income growth and modestly higher debt to partially finance  share repurchases. Fitch believes McDonald's sales will gradually benefit from increasing real  disposable income in the U.S, particularly for low-to-middle income consumers,  and brand-level initiatives around the world but views continued market share  losses as likely in 2015. Restaurant margins will also remain pressured given  weak sales and rising U.S. labor costs. Pricing remains limited due to  relatively low inflation, heightened competition, and still weak economic  conditions in most of Europe (which represented 40% of revenue and 41% of  operating income in 2014). McDonald's expects modest 1.5% - 2% commodity  inflation in the U.S. and Europe for 2015.  KEY RATING DRIVERS  Same-Store Sales and Market Share Trends As mentioned previously, McDonald's ratings incorporate its position as the  world's largest restaurant chain, with about $88 billion in system sales, 36,000  plus units, and over $27 billion of revenue. However, global SSS have been weak  for two consecutive years. Market share losses have occurred in the U.S. but,  according to the company, trends vary across Europe. McDonald's attributes economic conditions, heightened competition, and  unanticipated business interruptions caused by a supplier issue affecting the  Asia Pacific, Middle East, and Africa (APMEA) segment, and temporary store  closures in Russia for its challenges. Fitch also views modest slippage in  restaurant service, less effective promotions, and negative perceptions  regarding the brand's food among certain consumer demographics that prefer less  processed food with fresh ingredients as drivers. McDonald's intensified its  focus on value in 2013 and 2014 in order to drive traffic but annual guest  counts became increasingly negative across most major geographies.  Effectiveness of Brand Initiatives  McDonald's new CEO, officially as of March 1, is expected to accelerate efforts  to improve the brand image globally. In December 2014, the company detailed a  strategy to regain SSS growth in its core U.S. market. Plans entail simplifying  the menu to improve service and address local customer preferences, and creating  the Experience of the Future which includes, among other initiatives, a new  Create Your Taste (CYT) customizable burger platform. McDonald's also remains  focused on improving SSS in other priority markets including Germany, Japan, and  Australia.  Fitch views a cohesive and aggressive system-wide effort to improve service,  emphasize food quality, and provide locally-relevant menu variety as necessary  catalysts for SSS growth. McDonald's plan to launch CYT in the up to 2,000 U.S.  restaurants by the end of 2015 will likely have a limited near-term positive  impact on the company's image in the burger category as it only represents 14%  of total domestic locations. McDonald's brand recovery efforts in Japan will  also take time to resonate with consumers because of a high level of  competition, particularly in the convenience channel, and food quality incidents  beyond the July 2014 APMEA supplier challenge. Substantial but Decelerating Cash Flow Growth McDonald's generates substantial cash flow from operations at $6.7 billion in  2014. CFO declined 5% in 2014 due to lower sales and operating income, after  growing at an 8% CAGR from the launch of the firm's Plan to Win strategy in 2003  to $7.1 billion in 2013. Free cash flow (FCF - defined as CFO less capex less  dividends) remained meaningful at $931 million due to lower capex but was below  the company's annual average of $1.5 billion from 2010 to 2013.  Fitch expects CFO trends to stabilize in 2015 and then grow at a low  single-digit rate in 2016. FCF in 2015 will be enhanced by reductions in capex  as McDonald's slows unit growth in its most challenged countries and focuses on  regaining sales momentum but debt reduction is not anticipated.  McDonald's expects to spend about $2 billion in capex during 2015, down from  $2.6 billion in 2014 and the lowest level in five years. Capex will be allocated  roughly 50/50 between new units and reinvesting in existing locations, as  modernizing the customer experience remains a key global priority. Net  restaurant additions will be between 600 and 700, representing about 1.8%  expansion in 2015. Increasingly Aggressive Financial Strategy  Fitch views McDonald's financial strategy as increasingly aggressive given  negative SSS trends and the loss of market share. McDonald's has publicly  reiterated plans to return $18 billion - $20 billion in aggregate dividends and  share repurchases from 2014 through 2016, a 10% - 20% increase versus payouts  during the three-years ended 2013, despite weaker than expected operating  results. Fitch views McDonald's reduction of new unit capex as prudent given  weak sales and declining margins. As mentioned previously, FCF will be enhanced,  but debt reduction is not anticipated.  Cohesive Operating Framework, Franchising Fitch believes the continued alignment of corporate, franchisees and suppliers  to meet customer needs as critical to McDonald's success. The company's  significant scale is a benefit, providing bargaining power with procurement,  unmatched advertising capability, and convenient locations for consumers.  However, the ability to quickly adjust to consumer trends is likely difficult  due to its massive infrastructure.  McDonald's 81%/19% global mix of franchised to company stores at Dec. 31, 2014  supports cash flow, augments corporate margins, and assists with the rollout of  new system initiatives. High-margin royalties and contractual rent payments from  franchising represented 34% of revenue in 2014. McDonald's is on track to  refranchise 1,500 units from 2014 to 2016, mainly across Europe and APMEA, but  its ownership mix is not expected to change materially leaving company-owned  stores directly exposed to rising costs. McDonald's owns roughly 45% of the land and about 70% of the buildings within  its system. Fitch believes the company's strong asset base solidifies its  relationship with franchisees, increases the stability of its cash flow, reduces  contingent liabilities, and distinguishes McDonald's from its peers. Financial Flexibility, Liquidity, and Maturities:  McDonald's financial flexibility is supported by its substantial operating cash  flow, good FCF generation, ready market access, and high level of liquidity. At  Dec. 31, 2014, McDonald's had $4.6 billion of liquidity consisting of $2.1  billion of cash, of which $1.2 billion was held offshore, and availability under  an undrawn $2.5 billion committed revolver expiring December 2019. The company  had $200 million of commercial paper (CP) outstanding under its $2.5 billion CP  program at year end.  About 60% of McDonald's $15 billion of debt at Dec. 31, 2014 was U.S.  denominated and 40% was foreign denominated. Upcoming debt maturities  approximated $1.1 billion in 2015, $823 million in 2016, and $1 billion in 2017  based on year-end foreign exchange rates. Fitch views maturities as manageable  given McDonald's strong market access and annual FCF. McDonald's plans to  refinance its 2015 maturities. KEY ASSUMPTIONS --SSS are flat in 2015 and growth resumes to the low single-digit level by 2016; --Company-operated restaurant margins stabilize by 2016; --Operating cash flow stabilizes in 2015 and grows at a low single-digit rate  thereafter; --Total debt-to-operating EBITDA and total adjusted debt-to-operating EBITDAR  (defined as total debt plus 8x gross rents-to-operating EBITDA plus gross rents)  approximates 1.6x and 2.7x, respectively, in 2015 and 2016; --FCF approximates $1 billion or more annually. RATING SENSITIVITIES Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a negative  rating action include:  --If Fitch ascertains that global SSS will be negative in 2015 and market share  trends do not stabilize; --Management demonstrates an unwillingness to pull back on share repurchases if  sales trends continue to deteriorate;  --Total debt-to-operating EBITDA and total adjusted debt-to-operating EBITDAR  sustained above 1.5x and 2.5x, respectively. Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a positive  rating action include:  --An upgrade is not likely in the near term, given recent weak SSS trends,  on-going margin contraction, and increased leverage; --The Rating Outlook could  be revised to Stable if SSS are better than Fitch anticipates, market share  trends stabilize, or leverage is maintained below current levels. Fitch has affirmed its ratings on McDonald's as follows:  --Long-term IDR at 'A'; --Bank credit facilities at 'A'; --Senior unsecured debt at 'A'; --Short-term IDR at 'F1'; --Commercial paper at 'F1'.  The Rating Outlook has been revised to Negative from Stable.  Contact:  Primary Analyst Carla Norfleet Taylor, CFA  Senior Director +1-312-368-3195 Fitch Ratings, Inc. 70 W.

314,"   By Lisa Baertlein and P.J. Huffstutter  A plan by McDonald's Corp to phase out chicken raised with certain kinds of antibiotics at its 14,000 U.S. restaurants will put additional pressure on an already-stressed supply chain.Antibiotic-free chicken currently accounts for a tiny portion of total U.S. supplies, and an increasing desire on the part of consumers for more ""natural"" products has meant that demand sometimes exceeds supply. Available product has been so tight that when six of the largest U.S. school districts tried to make the switch to antibiotic-free poultry last year, chicken sellers such as Tyson Foods Inc and Pilgrim's Pride Corp said they could not change their production systems quickly enough to meet the demand.The decision by the world's biggest restaurant chain to jump into the fray seems likely to complicate things further, tightening supply and thereby raising prices, said Athlos Research principal Jonathan Feeney. ""This is very likely to cause a disruption in McDonald's food supply and will likely raise operating costs for McDonald's franchisees,"" added Richard Adams, a former McDonald's franchisee who now runs the consulting firm Franchise Equity Group.  One key impediment up to now in increasing supplies has been convincing livestock farmers and meat packers to switch to new farming practices that they fear could threaten their profit margins. Routine use of antibiotics can mean larger animals and less disease.Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc has some of the restaurant industry's highest standards for antibiotic-free meats, but it has occasionally had trouble finding supplies. From time to time its popular burrito restaurants have had to hang signs alerting diners that it was unable to get antibiotic-free chicken, beef or pork. McDonald's said Wednesday it will eliminate from its menus chicken raised with antibiotics that are ""critically important"" to human medicine, but unlike Chipotle, it will continue to purchase chicken raised with ionophores, an animal antibiotic commonly added to feed. QUICK CHICKEN, SLOW BEEF Public health advocates cheered McDonald's chicken plans on Wednesday, but they also pushed the chain to go further.   Jonathan Kaplan, director of the Natural Resources Defense Council's food and agriculture program noted that McDonald's new antibiotic policy has a ""disappointing loophole"" in that it covers only chicken and only U.S. restaurants. He also would like to see the chain expand its policy to all meats. ""Hopefully, chicken is just the start, the Big Mac and McRib may be next,"" he said. Switching to antibiotic-free pork and beef would present even tougher challenges, however. Making adjustment to supplies is easier in animals that mature more rapidly. It takes only about six weeks to get a chicken ready for slaughter, while it takes four to six months to ready a hog for market and 18 months or more for beef cattle. The company would almost certainly have difficult acquiring enough antibiotic-free beef, which is already in short supply, for its burgers. Chipotle and CKE Restaurants each traveled to Australia to find theirs.CKE Restaurants' Carl's Jr chain in December debuted a ""natural"" burger, from grass-fed cattle raised without antibiotics, steroids or added hormones, in its 1,150 U.S. restaurants.Brad Haley, CKE's chief marketing officer, said the company would love to start selling similar burgers at its Hardee's chain, but the company finds itself asking ""Where's the beef?""""I don't think there's enough for sizeable chains to move over in the immediate future,"" Haley said. ""There simply isn't enough all-natural beef.""Still, McDonald's told Reuters it will continue to ""look at all aspects of food sourcing and our menu"".

316,"   By P.J. Huffstutter and Lisa Baertlein | CHICAGO/LOS ANGELES  CHICAGO/LOS ANGELES McDonald's Corp's decision last week to phase out human antibiotics from its U.S. chicken supply will add to costs of production in a tight-margin business that are likely to be borne mostly by poultry companies.McDonald's, whose top chicken suppliers include giant Tyson Foods Inc, has given its producers two years to eradicate all antibiotics used on humans from barns and hatcheries. It's going to be expensive and may take longer than planned: switching to antibiotic-free chickens could increase on-farm costs by up to 3 percent. Perdue Farms, a supplier with about a third the volume of Tyson, told Reuters it's taken more than a decade and millions of dollars to make such a change.McDonald's will use its purchasing muscle as the world's largest restaurant chain to avoid passing extra costs on to customers, increasingly lower income as more affluent diners prefer competitors like Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc, said analysts including Morningstar's R.J. Hottovy.Marion Gross, McDonald's senior vice president of North America supply chain management, declined to say how much the company’s costs for chicken could rise. Rather, she told Reuters, the project is ""an investment"" to meet customer demand.While veterinary use of antibiotics is legal, controversy has grown over routine feeding of antibiotics that are important to humans to otherwise healthy chicken, cattle and pigs in a bid to stave off disease and help the animals grow more quickly.The risk is that overuse could spur the creation of so-called superbugs that develop cross-resistance to antibiotics used to treat humans. Reuters found last year that major U.S. poultry firms were administering antibiotics to their flocks on the farm far more pervasively than regulators realized.The poultry industry maintains there is little evidence that bacteria which do become resistant also infect people. However, more restaurants and retailers are heeding the concerns of consumers, straining meat supplies.Sandwich chain Chick-fil-A in 2014 gave its producers five years to meet its commitment to go antibiotic-free for chicken. Perdue is a major supplier to Chick-fil-A.Costco Wholesale Corp., the nation's third-largest retailer that annually sells 80 million rotisserie chickens, told Reuters Thursday it has a ""large"" appetite for chicken free of these medically-important antibiotics. The company is aware of the supply difficulties and won't commit to a timeline, said Craig Wilson, vice president of food safety for Costco.WHO PAYS THE PRICE? Some of the extra costs of cutting out antibiotics could be borne by franchisees, which could cut labor hours, waste and utility costs to offset higher meat prices. But most analysts expect McDonald's to push the costs back onto its suppliers, who may not have the market power to resist. The top four U.S. chicken processors control about 53 percent of the domestic market, according to the National Chicken Council.McDonald's ""carries a lot of clout with suppliers,"" and some of them are dependent on the chain for survival, Hottovy said.Tyson and Keystone Foods, part of Brazil-based Marfrig Global Foods SA, both told Reuters they have significantly reduced medically-important antibiotic use in their flocks and are positioned to meet McDonald's and other customers' needs. However, neither company would answer specific questions about how such drugs are used on-farm and in hatcheries.SLOW CHANGES  Perdue, the fourth-largest domestic chicken producer, began removing antibiotics used for growth promotion in 2002 amid consumer questions about what was being put into the animal feed, said Bruce Stewart-Brown, senior vice-president of food safety, quality and live operations.Now more than 95 percent of the chickens it produces are raised without antibiotics approved for human use, and more than half are raised with no antibiotics of any kind, according to the company.The transition led to unexpectedly high bird mortality rates, a need for more chicken houses and spending at least $4 million more a year on vaccines than rivals who haven't made the switch, among other things. Birds raised without antibiotics also generally take three to nine days longer to reach their market weight, Stewart-Brown told Reuters -- or as much as 20 percent longer than conventionally raised birds.McDonald's two-year deadline is ""a really fast timeframe to do it right and be predictable to your customers and your supply,"" Stewart-Brown said.Birds raised on farms without antibiotics take longer to reach optimal slaughter weight, resulting in higher feed costs and death rates, forcing companies to ramp up with more eggs at the hatcheries, said Tom Elam of FarmEcon, an agricultural consulting company.""The ones that aren't quite as good with keeping up with their biosecurity, it's going to cause some issues,"" Elam said.

His short tenure included 2014, when falling profit, revenue and traffic resulted in one of McDonald's worst years in decades. Steve Easterbrook, a McDonald's insider who led two UK-based restaurant chains before returning to the company in 2013, took the helm at the Golden Arches on March 1. The company that virtually invented fast food has struggled to find the right recipe to meet diners' growing appetite for healthier, fresher food. In his first big move as CEO, Easterbrook last week announced that McDonald's USA will switch to chicken raised with fewer antibiotics. The policy, which will affect McNuggets and other products sold in its roughly 14,000 U.S. stores, will put McDonald's more in step with Chipotle and Chick-fil-A.  McDonald's shares were up 0.8 percent at $97.90 at midday. The stock is up about 10 percent since Easterbrook's promotion was announced in late January. Sales at U.S. restaurants open at least 13 months dropped a steeper-than-expected 4 percent in February, contributing to the 1.7 percent decline in global sales for the month.Analysts, on average, had expected a 0.7 percent fall for the United States and a 0.3 percent drop worldwide, according to research firm Consensus Metrix.  February sales results from Europe were slightly better than expected, but the unit that includes Asia continued to struggle with the after-effects of a supply chain scandal last year. McDonald's has been trimming complicated menus to speed up service; giving restaurant operators more control over aspects including regional food choices; testing customized burgers and sandwiches to compete with Chipotle, Subway and other popular restaurants; and tweaking advertising to emphasize ""Lovin,"" a play on the company's ubiquitous ""I'm lovin' it"" tagline.

319,"   By P.J. Huffstutter and Lisa Baertlein | CHICAGO/LOS ANGELES  CHICAGO/LOS ANGELES McDonald's Corp's decision last week to phase out human antibiotics from its U.S. chicken supply will add to costs of production in a tight-margin business that are likely to be borne mostly by poultry companies.McDonald's, whose top chicken suppliers include giant Tyson Foods Inc, has given its producers two years to eradicate all antibiotics used on humans from barns and hatcheries. It's going to be expensive and may take longer than planned: switching to antibiotic-free chickens could increase on-farm costs by up to 3 percent. Perdue Farms, a supplier with about a third the volume of Tyson, told Reuters it's taken more than a decade and millions of dollars to make such a change.McDonald's will use its purchasing muscle as the world's largest restaurant chain to avoid passing extra costs on to customers, increasingly lower income as more affluent diners prefer competitors like Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc, said analysts including Morningstar's R.J. Hottovy.Marion Gross, McDonald's senior vice president of North America supply chain management, declined to say how much the company’s costs for chicken could rise. Rather, she told Reuters, the project is ""an investment"" to meet customer demand.While veterinary use of antibiotics is legal, controversy has grown over routine feeding of antibiotics that are important to humans to otherwise healthy chicken, cattle and pigs in a bid to stave off disease and help the animals grow more quickly.The risk is that overuse could spur the creation of so-called superbugs that develop cross-resistance to antibiotics used to treat humans. Reuters found last year that major U.S. poultry firms were administering antibiotics to their flocks on the farm far more pervasively than regulators realized.The poultry industry maintains there is little evidence that bacteria which do become resistant also infect people. However, more restaurants and retailers are heeding the concerns of consumers, straining meat supplies.Sandwich chain Chick-fil-A in 2014 gave its producers five years to meet its commitment to go antibiotic-free for chicken. Perdue is a major supplier to Chick-fil-A.Costco Wholesale Corp., the nation's third-largest retailer that annually sells 80 million rotisserie chickens, told Reuters Thursday it has a ""large"" appetite for chicken free of these medically-important antibiotics. The company is aware of the supply difficulties and won't commit to a timeline, said Craig Wilson, vice president of food safety for Costco.WHO PAYS THE PRICE? Some of the extra costs of cutting out antibiotics could be borne by franchisees, which could cut labor hours, waste and utility costs to offset higher meat prices. But most analysts expect McDonald's to push the costs back onto its suppliers, who may not have the market power to resist. The top four U.S. chicken processors control about 53 percent of the domestic market, according to the National Chicken Council.McDonald's ""carries a lot of clout with suppliers,"" and some of them are dependent on the chain for survival, Hottovy said.Tyson and Keystone Foods, part of Brazil-based Marfrig Global Foods SA, both told Reuters they have significantly reduced medically-important antibiotic use in their flocks and are positioned to meet McDonald's and other customers' needs. However, neither company would answer specific questions about how such drugs are used on-farm and in hatcheries.SLOW CHANGES  Perdue, the fourth-largest domestic chicken producer, began removing antibiotics used for growth promotion in 2002 amid consumer questions about what was being put into the animal feed, said Bruce Stewart-Brown, senior vice-president of food safety, quality and live operations.Now more than 95 percent of the chickens it produces are raised without antibiotics approved for human use, and more than half are raised with no antibiotics of any kind, according to the company.The transition led to unexpectedly high bird mortality rates, a need for more chicken houses and spending at least $4 million more a year on vaccines than rivals who haven't made the switch, among other things.

325,"   By Lisa Baertlein and P.J. Huffstutter | LOS ANGELES/CHICAGO  LOS ANGELES/CHICAGO KFC, the world's largest chain of fried chicken restaurants, may face pressure from consumer and environmental groups to change how its poultry are raised after McDonald's Corp said it would switch to chicken raised without human antibiotics.McDonald's will phase out chicken raised with antibiotics that are important to human health over two years to allay concern that use of the drugs in meat production has exacerbated the rise of deadly ""superbugs"" that resist treatment, Reuters reported last week. Within days, retailer Costco Wholesale Corp told Reuters it aims to eliminate the sale of chicken and meat raised with human antibiotics.KFC is owned by Louisville, Kentucky-based Yum Brands Inc, which has no publicly stated policy on antibiotic use in the production of meat it buys. Chick-fil-A, another chicken restaurant chain that competes with KFC, says about 20 percent of the chicken it serves is raised without any antibiotics, and that its entire supply chain will be converted by 2019. Both McDonald's and Yum are stepping up efforts to win back younger and wealthier diners lured away by chains such as such as Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc and Panera Bread Co, which boast antibiotic-free meats and other high-quality ingredients. Yum's KFC restaurants in China two years ago suffered a massive sales hit following local media reports that a few poultry farmers supplying KFC fed excessive levels of antibiotics to their chickens.""The train has left the station,"" Bob Goldin, a food services company consultant at Technomic in Chicago, said of McDonald's influence on U.S. chicken production standards. Yum, which also owns the Taco Bell and Pizza Hut chains, declined to discuss its standards for antibiotic use in meat production.""The chicken served in our U.S. restaurants is USDA high quality, and free of antibiotics,"" the company said in an emailed response to Reuters queries.  The antibiotic-free statement refers to a lack of residue in the meat served at its restaurants and not the practice of delivering antibiotics to chickens before they are slaughtered, said Steven Roach, food safety program director at Food Animal Concerns Trust in Chicago.The U.S. Department of Agriculture has three classifications for poultry, A, B, and C, and doesn't have a ""high quality"" designation for chicken. Poultry rated A is what's typically found at retail, while poultry rated B or C is usually used in further-processed products where the meat is cut up, chopped, or ground, according to a USDA website.         NOT PART OF THE CONVERSATION  McDonald's told Reuters it worked with a wide range of stakeholders, including environmental group Friends of the Earth, to develop its U.S. chicken guidelines. Yum and its brands have ignored requests for information regarding its antibiotic policy, said Kari Hamerschlag, senior program manager for Friends of the Earth's food and technology program.""They have so far not answered any of our emails or phone calls,"" said Hamerschlag, who is working with other advocacy groups to persuade food companies to change their supplier standards to exclude animals raised with the routine use of antibiotics. By contrast, McDonald's was ""very responsive"" to the groups' requests, she said.Other groups working with Friends of the Earth to cut antibiotics from chickens and other meats include the Natural Resources Defense Council, Consumers Union and the Center for Food Safety. Friends of the Earth said its interest in antibiotics has to do with animal agriculture's connection to the environment and human health.KFC supplier Tyson Foods Inc did not comment. Other U.S. chicken producers that have supplied Yum either declined to comment or could not be reached. It’s not known who KFC’s biggest supplier is or how many chickens KFC buys a year.In 2012, Chinese media reports about excessive antibiotic use by a few KFC chicken farmers hammered sales there. The country has more than 4,800 KFC restaurants and accounted for nearly half of Yum's 2014 operating profit. In response, Yum dropped some 1,000 small poultry farmers from its supply chain and launched a public relations campaign to reassure diners about the quality and safety of its food.      Yum operates separate supply chains in China and United States. While antibiotics have made for big headlines in China, the issue also has surfaced at home.A Reuters investigation last year found that KFC supplier Koch Foods Inc from November 2011 to July 2014 had given some of its flocks antibiotics critical to fighting human infections, even though its website stated otherwise.The Chicago-based chicken producer changed the language on its website after questions from Reuters about its use of virginiamycin, an antibiotic included in a class considered ""highly important"" to fighting infections in humans. At the time, Koch said it has no plans to discontinue the use of virginiamycin, which it says may be used to prevent a common intestinal infection in chicken.Koch did not respond to interview requests for this story.KFC US said at the time that its ""supply partners must adhere to our strict standards and specifications, which in some cases are more stringent than the FDA's regulations."" It declined to comment this week.

Poultry rated A is what's typically found at retail, while poultry rated B or C is usually used in further-processed products where the meat is cut up, chopped, or ground, according to a USDA website. NOT PART OF THE CONVERSATION McDonald's told Reuters it worked with a wide range of stakeholders, including environmental group Friends of the Earth, to develop its U.S. chicken guidelines. Yum and its brands have ignored requests for information regarding its antibiotic policy, said Kari Hamerschlag, senior program manager for Friends of the Earth's food and technology program.""They have so far not answered any of our emails or phone calls,"" said Hamerschlag, who is working with other advocacy groups to persuade food companies to change their supplier standards to exclude animals raised with the routine use of antibiotics. By contrast, McDonald's was ""very responsive"" to the groups' requests, she said.Other groups working with Friends of the Earth to cut antibiotics from chickens and other meats include the Natural Resources Defense Council, Consumers Union and the Center for Food Safety. Friends of the Earth said its interest in antibiotics has to do with animal agriculture's connection to the environment and human health. KFC supplier Tyson Foods Inc did not comment. Other U.S. chicken producers that have supplied Yum either declined to comment or could not be reached. It's not known who KFC's biggest supplier is or how many chickens KFC buys a year.In 2012, Chinese media reports about excessive antibiotic use by a few KFC chicken farmers hammered sales there. The country has more than 4,800 KFC restaurants and accounted for nearly half of Yum's 2014 operating profit. In response, Yum dropped some 1,000 small poultry farmers from its supply chain and launched a public relations campaign to reassure diners about the quality and safety of its food.Yum operates separate supply chains in China and United States. While antibiotics have made for big headlines in China, the issue also has surfaced at home.A Reuters investigation last year found that KFC supplier Koch Foods Inc from November 2011 to July 2014 had given some of its flocks antibiotics critical to fighting human infections, even though its website stated otherwise.The Chicago-based chicken producer changed the language on its website after questions from Reuters about its use of virginiamycin, an antibiotic included in a class considered ""highly important"" to fighting infections in humans. At the time, Koch said it has no plans to discontinue the use of virginiamycin, which it says may be used to prevent a common intestinal infection in chicken.Koch did not respond to interview requests for this story.KFC US said at the time that its ""supply partners must adhere to our strict standards and specifications, which in some cases are more stringent than the FDA's regulations."" It declined to comment this week.(Editing by Michele Gershberg and John Pickering)",2015-03-12,MCD,"Thu Mar 12, 2015 | 7:00am EDT",RPT - INSIGHT-KFC faces pressure after McDonald's says no antibiotics in chicken,http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-antibiotics-yum-idUSL1N0WD2X520150312?type=companyNews
327,"   By Adam Jourdan | SHANGHAI  SHANGHAI From cut-price apple pies to free iPads, companies in China are transforming Sunday's dreaded consumer rights day into a shopping frenzy, to blunt the impact of being named and shamed in state broadcaster CCTV's annual expose.McDonald's Corp is discounting pies three years after food safety lapses made it a one-time target of the broadcaster's ""3.15"" show, while e-commerce giant JD.com Inc is giving away tablet computers over four days of ""crazy sales"" ending Sunday.""Companies are being preemptive, making consumer day a positive story,"" said James Feldkamp, chief executive officer of consumer watchdog MingJian. ""If you're going to be a target, at least you're already doing something to balance it out.""The investigative news show, broadcast every World Consumer Rights Day, is in tune with a government drive to boost consumer protection laws and toughen punishments for misleading shoppers. Violations of consumer trust can go viral online in China, especially in sensitive sectors such as food, cars and make-up.The 3.15 show drew a rare apology from Apple Inc in 2013 after criticizing the iPad maker's customer service, and leveled a similar charge at camera manufacturer Nikon Corp last year. Similar broadcasts have dragged down China sales at McDonald's and KFC parent Yum Brands Inc.Such is the show's impact that in recent years firms have increasingly prepared for shocks by buttering up consumers. APPLE ""PI"" DAY Ahead of this year's March 15, former target Wal-Mart Stores Inc has deals on electronics and cosmetics on its online supermarket Yihaodian, and a ""say no to fakes"" campaign echoing government calls to outlaw counterfeit goods. Dealers of fellow victim Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) also have 3.15 discounts.Not all campaigns are explicitly linked to the day. Online retail giant Suning Commerce Group is giving away 30 million cartons of milk, yoghurt and other dairy products for as little as 20 cents each over five days ending on Saturday.At McDonald's, the apple pie price cut over Saturday and Sunday is touted as a ""3.14"" event - a play on the mathematical number ""pi"". The fast food chain, which gave away 1 million free breakfast McMuffins in China around the same time two years ago, said its pie promotion was in no way linked to 3.15. JD.com and Volkswagen declined to comment. Suning did not respond to emails seeking comment.COMPANIES ON EDGE  The 3.15 show, similar to CBS network's ""60 Minutes"" in the United States, may have lost some of its appeal as younger viewers turn to foreign dramas online. Some have even turned to social media to defend targeted firms.But that does not stop it being feared. People close to CCTV as well as ""firefighters"" helping firms respond to being targeted said some companies were given advance warning, while others had to scramble to respond after seeing their firm named for the first time on the late-night show.""Speaking for Wal-Mart, we will watch the show. I am certain every company who services customers will do so,"" said Raymond Bracy, head of corporate affairs at Walmart China.The plethora of cut-price offers, however, may dampen the impact on targeted firms among consumers busy snapping up deals.""It's a carnival for shopping online and I've bought a few things,"" said Zhang Dasu, a 22-year-old from Shanghai. ""I may be too tired to stay up to midnight to watch the show, though.""

332,"  SAO PAULO, March 18 Brazilian unions on Wednesday filed another lawsuit against the largest operator of McDonald's restaurants in Latin America, alleging that the firm violates the country's labor laws.The suit against Arcos Dourados Comércio de Alimentos Ltda, the Brazilian division of Buenos Aires-based Arcos Dorados Holdings Inc, came just days after McDonald's Corp  workers from 19 U.S. cities filed state and federal complaints over working conditions.It also followed a similar filing made by Brazilian unions in late February.Wednesday's lawsuit aims to ""guarantee health and safety in the workplace,"" according to a joint statement from the unions, which are backed by CUT and UTG, two of Brazil's largest labor federations.The unions demand that Arcos Dourados establish specific job functions for each employee and hire more workers under that model while paying compensation for any moral and punitive damages caused to current and former employees. The lawsuit also demands that Arcos Dourados deliver a working plan to Brazil's labor ministry within 90 days or face a daily fine of 100,000 reais ($30,864).Fines for violations of Brazilian labor law can vary between 1 percent and 30 percent of a company's annual sales. Arcos Dorados' Brazilian division had 833 restaurants and total revenue of $460.9 million for the third quarter that ended Sept. 30.A separate lawsuit filed by Brazilian unions on Feb. 24 accused Arcos Dourados of unwholesome and unsanitary working conditions, time-clock fraud and failing to pay mandatory unemployment and retirement insurance. It also said Arcos Dourados paid below legal or contractual minimum wages, forced double-shift work without breaks, made workers take in-restaurant lunch breaks with employer-supplied food and failed to make mandatory severance payments. That suit aims to ban the opening of any new McDonald's restaurants in Brazil until the problems are fixed.An Arcos Dorados spokeswoman said in an emailed statement that the company had not yet been officially informed of the lawsuit.""Still, the company continues to reaffirm, with conviction, that it complies with all labor laws, respects the rights of all its workers, and maintains labor practices that have been recognized by the market,"" the statement said.($1 = 3.24 Brazilian reais)   (Reporting by Asher Levine; Editing by Paul Simao)",2015-03-18,MCD,"Wed Mar 18, 2015 | 11:10am EDT",Brazilian unions file 2nd lawsuit against McDonald's operator,http://www.reuters.com//article/mcdonalds-brazil-arcos-dora-hldg-idUSL2N0WK0YZ20150318?type=companyNews

338,"   By Georgina Prodhan | FRANKFURT  FRANKFURT McDonald's Corp (MCD.N) is introducing table service in Germany as it reinvents itself as a ""modern, progressive burger company"" under new Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook.The world's biggest fast-food chain has been testing myriad new ideas, including kiosk ordering, custom burgers and even a completely new restaurant brand in a bid to revive slumping sales and better compete with more nimble chains ranging from Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (CMG.N) to Burger King (QSR.TO).""This is where McDonald's is headed,"" Easterbrook said at a McDonald's in the Frankfurt Airport that serves more than 1 million customers a year.Diners at that restaurant can now choose to be served at their table after placing an order at the front counter, via a digital kiosk or with a waiter carrying a tablet computer.McDonald's has tested table service in other markets, a spokeswoman told Reuters. Easterbrook, 47, made the announcement at the reopening of the restaurant, which is Germany's biggest with more than 500 seats. Germany has been a challenging market for McDonald's, which has struggled to find the right recipe for selling to the nation's health- and cost-conscious diners.McDonald's executives have identified its priority turnaround markets as Germany, Japan, Australia and the United States, where it plans to expand a custom hamburger program called ""Create Your Taste"" and next month will start testing all-day breakfast in San Diego. Easterbrook, a Briton who took the helm on March 1, is the second non-American to take the job. His challenge is to halt a slide in sales around the world.Weakness in France and Germany, which has almost 1,500 restaurants, contributed to a 1.1 percent decline in comparable sales in Europe in the fourth quarter. Britain, France, Russia and Germany together accounted for 67 percent of European revenue in 2013.               McDonald's said earlier this month it would remake itself after competition from Chipotle, Chick-fil-A and other chains bit into U.S. restaurant sales. Easterbrook has already said McDonald's USA will switch to chicken raised with fewer antibiotics, putting it more in step with Chipotle and Chick-fil-A. Easterbrook did not take media questions at the event.  In meetings with financial analysts last week, the new CEO called himself an ""internal activist"" and said he would look at everything that could create shareholder value, including cost cutting and a real estate investment trust but said he had not yet committed to a strategy, analysts said.

341,"   By Foo Yun Chee | BRUSSELS  BRUSSELS European Union antitrust regulators have asked Luxembourg for information on its tax rulings for McDonald's after labor unions accused the U.S. fast food chain of avoiding taxes, a person involved in the issue said on Tuesday.The move, which neither the EU nor Luxembourg would immediately confirm, falls well short of the proceedings the EU has instigated against other U.S. multinationals in Luxembourg and elsewhere, where Brussels believes unfairly low taxation may have distorted competition. It does, however, put the hamburger restaurant group's financial arrangements into the spotlight.Unions from the United States and Europe and British-based charity War on Want last month urged the European Commission to investigate what they said involved about 1 billion euros ($1.07 billion) in tax between 2009 and 2013.""The Commission has sent a letter to Luxembourg asking them to clarify the facts,"" the source told Reuters.McDonald's did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokesman for the Luxembourg government said he was not aware of the letter. A Commission spokesman declined comment on whether a letter was sent to Luxembourg about McDonald's. The Commission's competition authority last year launched four investigations into whether deals struck with three national taxation authorities in the EU -- known as tax rulings -- constituted illegal state aid for the firms concerned.If proven, those could mean Amazon and FIAT paying back large sums in back-taxes to Luxembourg as well as Starbucks to the Netherlands and Apple to Ireland. Belgian tax rulings are also being probed. LUXEMBOURG FOCUS A spokesman for Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said: ""Combating tax evasion and avoidance is a top priority ... The Commission is taking a structured approach when using its state aid enforcement powers to investigate where it believes that selective tax advantages distort fair competition."" The Commission, headed since November by Jean-Claude Juncker, has moved to insist on all 28 member states making tax arrangements with multinational firms more transparent. It says it plans further regulation this year to prevent what critics say have been schemes that benefit global firms and some small states at the expense of government revenues in other countries.Juncker himself, who was finance minister and prime minister of Luxembourg for a quarter-century, has deflected criticism for his country's use of tax rulings to attract foreign businesses and says his priority is a level playing field across Europe.

342,"   By Daniel Wiessner  A series of National Labor Relations Board cases that seek to hold McDonald's Corp liable for alleged labor violations by its franchisees began Monday, the start of a long process that will likely signal a profound shift for U.S. businesses. Administrative Law Judge Lauren Esposito in Manhattan began presiding over dozens of consolidated cases on Monday that claim McDonald's franchisees across the country unlawfully interfered with employees' rights to organize and call for higher wages. She will also hold hearings in Los Angeles and Chicago before a consolidated trial begins in May, which is expected to last several months.

343,"   By Lisa Baertlein | LOS ANGELES  LOS ANGELES McDonald's Corp (MCD.N) plans to raise the average pay of about 90,000 U.S. workers to around $10 an hour, but the increase will not benefit workers at the vast majority of the restaurants, because they are operated by franchisees, who make their own wage decisions. Workers groups said the move by McDonald's, which is also adding benefits such as paid vacations, fell short of their goals. They planned a nationwide protest for Thursday. Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) and other retailers have introduced entry-level wage hikes in response to frequent worker protests calling for higher pay and better conditions. McDonald's, which announced the increases on Wednesday, has been fighting weak traffic and slumping sales in the United States.The pay increase, for workers at roughly 1,500 company-owned U.S. restaurants, will take effect on July 1.Starting wages at the restaurants will move to $1 above the locally mandated minimum wage. The increase will take the average hourly rate for those workers to $9.90 on July 1, up from $9.01 currently, McDonald's said. By the end of 2016, McDonald's said, the average hourly wage rate for McDonald's employees at those restaurants will exceed  $10.Almost 90 percent of McDonald's more than 14,000 U.S. restaurants are operated by franchisees, who set pay and benefits for their own workers. But the expectation is they will  face pressure to follow suit to stay competitive as employers. McDonald's also said that full- and part-time crew employees at company-operated restaurants, with at least one year of service, will begin to accrue personal paid time-off. Workers said the company does not currently offer paid time-off.Beyond that, some employees at both company- and franchise-run stores will be eligible for education assistance.""We know that a motivated workforce leads to better customer service, so we believe this initial step not only benefits our employees, it will improve the McDonald's restaurant experience,"" Steve Easterbrook, who became McDonald's chief executive on March 1, said in a statement.      The wage move quickly drew criticism.""This is too little to make a real difference, and covers only a fraction of workers,"" Kwanza Brooks, a McDonald's worker from Charlotte, North Carolina, who earns $7.25 per hour, said in a statement. Brooks is part of the union-supported ""Fight for $15"" movement, which is calling on employers to more than double wages above the federal minimum wage of $7.25. The group plans a nationwide protest at McDonald's restaurants on Thursday.Shares of McDonald's, whose annual profit and revenue fell last year, were essentially flat at $96.29 in extended trading. The wage increase at McDonald's company-run restaurants could force franchisees to follow. In turn, that could cause  those franchisees to raise food prices to cover higher labor costs. That could benefit McDonald's because it collects royalties from franchisees based on sales. But, it also could squeeze franchisee profits and threaten the company's Dollar Menu, which is popular with the chain's core base of lower-income diners.Bigger sales from price increases means more revenue to McDonald's Corp, which could solve some of the company's problems and make Easterbrook look like he is fixing things, said Richard Adams, a former McDonald's franchisee who now consults for current ones.""They'll try to paint this as altruistic,"" said Adams.

Some may not. We can't dictate what they do in the wage arena,"" King told Reuters in an interview. King said the NLRB cases did not figure into the McDonald's wage move. A NLRB administrative law judge is presiding over the NLRB cases, and a consolidated trial is scheduled to begin in May. The NLRB attorneys have argued that Illinois-based McDonald's and the franchisees should be held jointly responsible because corporate policies and franchise agreements have a major impact on working conditions. McDonald's has denied the allegations.Any decision by the judge, Lauren Esposito, is expected to be appealed to the five-member board and, ultimately, to federal courts. The outcome of the proceedings could have wide-ranging implications for franchise businesses and other types of employers.The decision to raise wages probably does put some pressure on franchisees to do the same, said Sara Senatore, restaurant analyst for Bernstein Research, a Wall Street research firm. She said that fast-food chains such as McDonald's compete for workers with each other and with retailers such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc, which this month raised worker wages.""Market forces in this case are going to be pretty powerful. Franchisees are small-business people. Ultimately, they're going to do what's dictated by the competitive environment,"" Senatore said.

352,"   By Lisa Baertlein | LOS ANGELES  LOS ANGELES McDonald's Corp (MCD.N) plans to raise the average pay of about 90,000 U.S. workers to around $10 an hour, but the increase will not benefit workers at the vast majority of the restaurants, because they are operated by franchisees, who make their own wage decisions. Workers groups said the move by McDonald's, which is also adding benefits such as paid vacations, fell short of their goals. They planned a nationwide protest for Thursday. Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) and other retailers have introduced entry-level wage hikes in response to frequent worker protests calling for higher pay and better conditions. McDonald's, which announced the increases on Wednesday, has been fighting weak traffic and slumping sales in the United States.The pay increase, for workers at roughly 1,500 company-owned U.S. restaurants, will take effect on July 1.Starting wages at the restaurants will move to $1 above the locally mandated minimum wage. The increase will take the average hourly rate for those workers to $9.90 on July 1, up from $9.01 currently, McDonald's said. By the end of 2016, McDonald's said, the average hourly wage rate for McDonald's employees at those restaurants will exceed  $10.Almost 90 percent of McDonald's more than 14,000 U.S. restaurants are operated by franchisees, who set pay and benefits for their own workers. But the expectation is they will  face pressure to follow suit to stay competitive as employers. McDonald's also said that full- and part-time crew employees at company-operated restaurants, with at least one year of service, will begin to accrue personal paid time-off. Workers said the company does not currently offer paid time-off.Beyond that, some employees at both company- and franchise-run stores will be eligible for education assistance.""We know that a motivated workforce leads to better customer service, so we believe this initial step not only benefits our employees, it will improve the McDonald's restaurant experience,"" Steve Easterbrook, who became McDonald's chief executive on March 1, said in a statement.      The wage move quickly drew criticism.""This is too little to make a real difference, and covers only a fraction of workers,"" Kwanza Brooks, a McDonald's worker from Charlotte, North Carolina, who earns $7.25 per hour, said in a statement. Brooks is part of the union-supported ""Fight for $15"" movement, which is calling on employers to more than double wages above the federal minimum wage of $7.25. The group plans a nationwide protest at McDonald's restaurants on Thursday.Shares of McDonald's, whose annual profit and revenue fell last year, were essentially flat at $96.29 in extended trading. The wage increase at McDonald's company-run restaurants could force franchisees to follow. In turn, that could cause  those franchisees to raise food prices to cover higher labor costs. That could benefit McDonald's because it collects royalties from franchisees based on sales. But, it also could squeeze franchisee profits and threaten the company's Dollar Menu, which is popular with the chain's core base of lower-income diners.Bigger sales from price increases means more revenue to McDonald's Corp, which could solve some of the company's problems and make Easterbrook look like he is fixing things, said Richard Adams, a former McDonald's franchisee who now consults for current ones.""They'll try to paint this as altruistic,"" said Adams. ""It's not as nice as it sounds.""

According to another poll by Morgan Stanley of 3,000 U.S. adults, the cohort known as Millennials, generally defined as being 18 to 34 years old, care more about all-natural and organic ingredients than older generations. Millennials also are more likely than other groups to eat out on a weekly basis. And while they still eat more traditional fast food than other generations, they express more dissatisfaction with the category, according to the Morgan Stanley poll. That helps explain why chains like Chick-fil-A and Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc, which have committed to sourcing 100 percent antibiotic-free meats, have been taking a bite out of McDonald's sales. More than one-third of parents who answered the Reuters/Ipsos poll said they take their children to McDonald's at most a few times a year.MULTIPLE MAKEOVERS  A series of critical documentaries over roughly the last decade, including ""Super Size Me"" in 2004, amplified consumer concerns about the health effect of eating fast food.

357,"  (Adds link to TV feature)By Adam JourdanSHANGHAI, April 11 Dimmed lights and colonial-style balconies give little indication that trendy Shanghai eatery Atto Primo is part of global fast-food giant Yum Brands Inc, owner of the KFC and Pizza Hut brands.Overlooking Shanghai's iconic riverside Bund and rubbing shoulders with the city's most expensive venues, the restaurant is what Yum calls a ""lab"" where it studies Chinese diners as it looks to bounce back from a lengthy slump in its top market.""A high-end test kitchen will let Yum test the waters with new menus and concepts and get feedback from more sophisticated diners - helpful if you want to go a bit upmarket,"" said Ben Cavender, principal at China Market Research Group.Yum's same-store sales at its nearly 7,000 restaurants in China, the firm's biggest market for revenue and profit, fell 16 percent in the last quarter of 2014, dragged down by back-to-back food scares, rising local competition and a sense its main KFC brand may have fallen out of touch with China's consumers.The restaurant is ""an innovation lab to help us learn more about the evolving tastes of Chinese consumers"", Yum spokesman Jonathan Blum said in emailed comments to Reuters. He added it would help test recipes to be used at Yum's China outlets.For Yum, a China turnaround is vital. New CEO Greg Creed said last month that reviving sales in the country was ""priority number one, two, and three"".""This new development shows someone has advised them that they've got to try something different,"" said Michael Griffiths, Shanghai-based analyst with market research firm TNS. With its fancy crystal, high prices and murals influenced by 16th century Italian painters, Atto Primo's ties to Yum are almost invisible: its only link to Yum is a brief mention in a U.S. regulatory filing.BRAND FATIGUE The high-end diner isn't the only new strategy for Yum in China, where it is planning to build 700 new fast-food stores overall this year. CEO Creed said the firm aimed to rival Starbucks Corp with more coffee offerings in China. However, analysts say Yum is suffering ""brand fatigue"" in the country. Its image has been hurt by the food scares, which raised doubts over its supply chain, and competition is rising. Tang Yenan, a 29-year-old architect in Shanghai, said he used to eat often at KFC about 15 years ago when it seemed ""fancy and new"" and was seen as a safe and clean alternative to local options.""Now I don't have KFC so often, because I have so many other choices,"" he said.McDonald's Corp has also been stung in China by food scares, but moves to upgrade stores and roll out its McCafe concept have helped offset the damage, analysts said.Nonetheless, both brands have lost some ground as more nimble local rivals have tempted cost-conscious diners with healthier-sounding, homegrown fare.Online chatter about the two brands - both good and bad - has stalled on China's influential Sina Weibo. Such a trend would normally cause some concern among marketers that brands are struggling to stay totally relevant to younger audiences.Yum has seen its share of China's nearly 800 billion yuan ($129 billion) fast-food market fall over the last few years, according to market research firm Euromonitor. Meanwhile, McDonald's has edged up slightly, despite major investment.($1 = 6.1999 Chinese yuan renminbi)   (Additional reporting by Lisa Baertlein in LOS ANGELES, Jane Lee and SHANGHAI newsroom; Editing by Mark Bendeich)",2015-04-13,MCD,"Mon Apr 13, 2015 | 4:48am EDT",UPDATE 1-Yum's upmarket China diner seeks recipe for revival,http://www.reuters.com//article/yum-china-idUSL4N0XA3FM20150413?type=companyNews

360,"  (Repeating story for additional subscribers without changes to text)By Nathan Layne and Lisa BaertleinApril 15 Tens of millions of dollars and counting. That's how much the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) has spent so far on a three-year campaign to improve the plight of low-wage retail and fast-food workers, an analysis of public filings shows.The money, which has gone to labor groups, lawyers and others involved in the effort, has provided financial firepower for a movement that has made surprising progress in its push for lifting wages, successfully making the issue part of the public conversation.In recent months, cities have passed or introduced laws to require higher minimum wages within their boundaries. Wal-Mart Stores and McDonald's Corp, among a number of big employers, have raised minimum pay. And on Wednesday, organizers say, tens of thousands of people will fan out across 200 U.S. cities in the biggest rally since the campaign got its start in late 2012.But the union's critics are focused on another number: zero. That's the tally of fast-food workers who have joined SEIU's membership rolls since the campaign began. And with McDonald's and other deep-pocketed fast-food chains determined to fight back any attempts at unionization, organizing the industry is an objective that even labor advocates warn might not be achievable.The lack of organizing success to date has led some to ask whether the union should continue spending large sums to better the lives of workers who are unlikely to become members. One SEIU organizer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said members would get ""restless"" if progress on boosting membership wasn't evident after a few years.U.S. fast-food workers have been notoriously difficult to organize due to high turnover and a fragmented industry structure. Most outlets are independently operated by franchisees and have generally been considered legally separate from the parent chain.

While DuPont is expected to report lower first-quarter results, Travelers Companies Inc's first-quarter results are expected to be in line with estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Investors will keep an eye out for details on Verizon's upcoming mobile video service and capital expenditure range and will look for updates on AT&T's proposed $48.5 billion deal to buy DirectTV, which is under regulatory review. Boeing faces fears of an aircraft downturn after it booked record orders in 2014, while Steve Easterbrook, McDonald's new CEO, is charged with reviving the company's falling sales and managing negative PR around the healthiness of its food. Investors will be watching the impact of the strong dollar on 3M's first-quarter results and Microsoft is expected to report sharply lower profit for its third quarter as sales of personal computers remain soggy.Search engine giant Google Inc is expected to report first-quarter revenue slightly below analysts' estimate on Thursday, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Google, which has been officially charged of cheating consumers and competitors by the European Union, is also being investigated for its Android mobile operating system. Analysts say the latter could prove a bigger threat to Google's future profitability. Analysts expect foreign exchange to negatively impact revenues in the first quarter even as paid click growth is poised to decelerate again.Facebook Inc is expected to post a first-quarter profit above Wall Street's expectations on Wednesday, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. The world's largest social network's business has been booming thanks to its mobile ads on smartphones and tablets. Many investors also expect that video ads will provide the company's next leg of growth. Facebook has also been stepping up efforts to expand products like messaging service WhatsApp and photo-sharing service Instagram. Investors will be looking out for the company's outlook for the remainder of 2015.On Thursday, the e-commerce company Amazon.com Inc is expected to report first-quarter revenue largely in line with analysts' average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. However, analysts are expecting margins to improve as the company gets a grip on a slew of investments on everything from Hollywood-style television productions to cloud computing and consumer devices.On Tuesday, Yahoo Inc is expected to report first-quarter revenue in line with analysts' estimate, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data, as its overall share of U.S. desktop searches declines.

Analysts are expecting 96 cents per share, up sharply from a year before.On Wednesday, chipmaker Qualcomm Inc is likely to report second-quarter revenue and profit broadly in line with analysts' average estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Qualcomm lowered its outlook for fiscal 2015 in January, saying it did not expect its newest Snapdragon mobile chip to be used in a major customer's flagship smartphone. Samsung opted for its own mobile processor and modem chip in the Galaxy S6 instead of equivalents from Qualcomm. The chipmaker had also warned that ""challenges"" with another of its chips had hurt its competitiveness in China. Qualcomm recently came under pressure from hedge fund Jana Partners to spin off its chip business from its patent-licensing business.Credit Suisse reports earnings for the first three months of 2015 on Tuesday. Meanwhile, on Friday the Swiss bank will ask shareholders to sign off in a symbolic vote on executive pay for 2014, when Credit Suisse became the largest bank in decades to plead guilty to a U.S. criminal charge and will pay more than $2.5 billion in penalties for helping Americans evade taxes.Investors will focus on existing home sales on Wednesday, which is expected to have increased 3.0 percent to an annual rate of 5.05 million units. Also, data for new home sales is expected to be released on Thursday. On Friday, the U.S. Commerce Department releases data for durable goods.Starbucks Corp reports its second-quarter results on Thursday. Starbucks is one of the restaurant industry's top performers, but investors and analysts worry that its streak of red-hot growth is coming to an end. The company has a variety of plans in place to boost sales (adding booze, smoothies, more lunch and dinner options, improving and expanding tea selections and testing delivery) and investors will be looking for proof that those are working.On Tuesday, Yum Brands Inc will report its first-quarter results. Yum's China business remains in the spotlight as it fights to recover from the latest food scandal in its biggest market. Analysts say the company is suffering from ""brand fatigue"" in China, where competition is mounting and its image has been hurt by food scares that have raised doubts over its supply chain.Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc is slated to announce results for the first quarter on Tuesday. Chipotle is still having problems finding pork suppliers to replace the one it suspended for running afoul of its animal welfare rules. The company says customers have simply switched to other meats and that it isn't losing sales - but investors will be on alert for any signs of a slowdown.Drugmaker Biogen Inc is expected to report a higher first-quarter profit on Friday, driven by strong sales of its top-selling oral MS drug, Tecfidera, which has seen burgeoning sales since its launch in 2013. Biogen, which leads the United States multiple sclerosis market with five drugs for the condition, recently reported promising data for its Alzheimer's drug. Investors will also be looking for commentary on Tecfider's growth expectations, and potential for competition, as well as the longer-acting MS injectable Plegridy.AbbVie Inc, whose planned $21 billion acquisition of Pharmacyclics Inc is meant to lessen the company's dependence on its blockbuster Humira arthritis drug, is expected to report sharply higher earnings and sales for the first quarter on Thursday, fueled by Humira's continuing growth and sales of the company's recently approved Viekira Pak treatment for hepatitis C. Investors will be keen for details on sales prospects for Viekira Pak, given steep price discounts AbbVie has given to compete with Gilead Science Inc's potent treatments for the liver disease.Eli Lilly and Co is expected to report higher first-quarter earnings on Thursday as the Indianapolis drugmaker begins to recover from patent expirations that slashed demand for its biggest products. The company is well positioned to deliver a promised return to profit growth this year, helped by new treatments for cancer and diabetes and growing sales of its animal health brands.Abbott Laboratories will report its first-quarter earnings on Wednesday. Recovering sales of Abbott Laboratories' infant formulas, following costly recalls in Asia, and improving performance of the company's branded generic medicines, are expected to drive quarterly earnings growth despite the negative impact of the stronger dollar.Ebay Inc is expected to report results for the first quarter largely in line with Wall Street expectations on Wednesday. The company has seen strong growth in payments business as well as its non-auction e-commerce business. Analysts expect that the company will continue to benefit from the rise in demand for mobile devices, as consumers increasingly use their smart phones and tablets to shop online. Investors will look for details on the company's plans for the spinoff of PayPal scheduled for the second half of 2015.On Thursday, Dow Chemical Co is expected to report a lower first-quarter profit due to a stronger dollar and a slowdown in its agricultural business. The company last month said it would offload a bulk of its low-margin bleach and vinyl-related business to Olin in a $5 billion. Investors will be looking for further comments on the company's cost-saving plans. Johnson Controls Inc, the auto parts supplier and maker of climate control systems for buildings, is expected to report higher second-quarter profit on Thursday, driven by higher sales in its seating and interiors business as auto sales and production rose in the first quarter. The company's buildings efficiency business, which provides air conditioning equipment and building management services, is also expected to report higher revenue as U.S. office vacancy rate declined to its lowest level since the third quarter to 2009. Investors will be looking for comments on Johnson Controls' business focus and outlook following the sale of its workplace solutions business to CBRE Group.Pentagon's No. 1 arms supplier, Lockheed Martin Corp, reports first-quarter results on Tuesday. Lockheed Martin has been focusing on increasing sales to commercial customers in United States as well as international governments to make up for pressures from tight U.S. defense spending. Lockheed gets 17 percent of its revenue from international markets and 1 percent from U.S. commercial customers. Investors will be looking to see if Lockheed still expects U.S. military spending to meaningfully pick up this year.Weapons maker Raytheon Co has increased exposure to international markets, which account for about 27 percent of its total sales, as U.S. defense spending remains tight. The maker of the Tomahawk missile and the Patriot missile defense system forecast disappointing 2015 revenue in January as domestic orders remained weak. When the company will report its first-quarter results on Thursday, investors will be looking for an update on a $2 billion order for the Patriot missile defense system that Raytheon expected to win in the first quarter.On Tuesday, Omnicom Group Inc, the No. 1 U.S. advertising company, is expected to report first-quarter results largely in-line with analysts' average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Omnicom had warned that a strong dollar would hit revenue this year. Omnicom, whose clients include Apple, McDonald's and Adidas, gets a little less than half of its revenue from outside the United States. On Friday, Interpublic Group of Companies Inc is expected to report first-quarter revenue in line with analysts' average estimate according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. The company's previous quarter was helped by higher ad spending by businesses in the United States.On Tuesday, chipmaker Broadcom Corp is expected to report first-quarter revenue in line with analysts' estimate, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Analysts expect the company's connectivity business to sequentially decline as it comes off a strong Apple-driven fourth quarter. Analysts will be looking for the company to provide outlook for the quarter ending June.On Wednesday, data storage company EMC Corp is expected to report first-quarter profit and revenue below analysts' estimate, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. The company had in January forecast a lower-than-expected profit for 2015 and said it would cut jobs. The company, which earns nearly half of its revenue from international markets, is expected to be hurt by a strong dollar. Analysts say enterprise storage demand has been mixed in quarter which may hurt EMC.Virtualization software maker VMware Inc is expected to report first-quarter revenue slightly below analysts' estimate on Tuesday, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data, hurt by a stronger dollar. More than 48 percent of VMware's revenue comes from outside the United States.

It has also tried to diversify and add a new stream of revenue by acquiring jerky maker Krave Pure Foods Inc in January, marking its first foray into meat snacks.

Teck CEO also refuted speculations of a possible merger with HudBay Minerals or an acquisition of Zaldivar, a copper mine owned by Barrick Gold.

367,"   By Lisa Baertlein | LOS ANGELES  LOS ANGELES As McDonald's Corp prepares yet another plan to revive its business, company watchers have the following advice: reconnect with lower income consumers who remain faithful to the brand, improve wages and ease the financial burden on operators.Steve Easterbrook, the company's new chief executive, on May 4 will announce his plan to reinvent McDonald's as a ""modern, progressive burger company"" that is more responsive to global diners' increasing demand for fresh, less processed and more customized food. The company signaled its plan for a fresh start after reporting another quarter of disappointing financial results. It declined to provide further details ahead of the announcement.Easterbrook has helped forge previous restructuring plans at the world's largest hamburger chain. They include simplifying complicated menus, flattening management structure, closing hundreds of underperforming restaurants and removing important human antibiotics from its chicken production.     Faith Popcorn, founder and CEO of marketing consulting firm BrainReserve, would like to see McDonald's embrace the lower-income consumers that account for a big share of its diners and employees.  ""They should be the champions of the 99 percent,"" said Popcorn, who has worked with McDonald's in the past and advised some of the best known U.S. consumer brands, including Coca-Cola Co and Campbell Soup Co.She advised the company to take concrete steps, such as serving healthier fast food and encouraging franchisees to follow McDonald's corporate leadership to raise wages for restaurant crew members.U.S. franchisees in a recent survey said their relations with McDonald's Corp had hit a new low. They called on the company to implement changes to help their bottom lines.  The franchisees, who operate nearly 90 percent of McDonald's U.S. restaurants, worry the company is trying too hard to be all things to all people. They called on management to significantly downsize the menu and rethink a plan for custom burgers that they worry will be labor-intensive and expensive.One franchisee also called for cost relief.     ""Nothing would ignite owner/operators more than lower rent and service fees,"" said the franchisee, whose identity was not revealed. McDonald's rivals such as Wendy's Co and Burger King have boosted their financials by selling virtually all their restaurants to franchisees.  McDonald's could make a similar move by increasing the percentage of its global franchised restaurants to 90 percent from 80 percent, said RBC Capital Markets analyst David Palmer.""We believe that the management gets it,"" Palmer said, adding that the question is how long it will take to turn the ship.

By October 2001, 70 percent of its value had evaporated.""I do think there are valuation concerns, and some tech companies are trading at extremely high multiples,"" said Derek Hoyt, chief investment officer at Minneapolis-based KDV Wealth Management.

377,"  (Repeats Wednesday story with no changes to text.)By Lisa BaertleinLOS ANGELES, April 22 As McDonald's Corp  prepares yet another plan to revive its business, company watchers have the following advice: reconnect with lower income consumers who remain faithful to the brand, improve wages and ease the financial burden on operators.Steve Easterbrook, the company's new chief executive, on May 4 will announce his plan to reinvent McDonald's as a ""modern, progressive burger company"" that is more responsive to global diners' increasing demand for fresh, less processed and more customized food.The company signaled its plan for a fresh start after reporting another quarter of disappointing financial results . It declined to provide further details ahead of the announcement.Easterbrook has helped forge previous restructuring plans at the world's largest hamburger chain. They include simplifying complicated menus, flattening management structure, closing hundreds of underperforming restaurants and removing important human antibiotics from its chicken production. Faith Popcorn, founder and CEO of marketing consulting firm BrainReserve, would like to see McDonald's embrace the lower-income consumers that account for a big share of its diners and employees.""They should be the champions of the 99 percent,"" said Popcorn, who has worked with McDonald's in the past and advised some of the best known U.S. consumer brands, including Coca-Cola Co and Campbell Soup Co.She advised the company to take concrete steps, such as serving healthier fast food and encouraging franchisees to follow McDonald's corporate leadership to raise wages for restaurant crew members. U.S. franchisees in a recent survey said their relations with McDonald's Corp had hit a new low. They called on the company to implement changes to help their bottom lines.The franchisees, who operate nearly 90 percent of McDonald's U.S. restaurants, worry the company is trying too hard to be all things to all people. They called on management to significantly downsize the menu and rethink a plan for custom burgers that they worry will be labor-intensive and expensive. One franchisee also called for cost relief.""Nothing would ignite owner/operators more than lower rent and service fees,"" said the franchisee, whose identity was not revealed.McDonald's rivals such as Wendy's Co and Burger King  have boosted their financials by selling virtually all their restaurants to franchisees.McDonald's could make a similar move by increasing the percentage of its global franchised restaurants to 90 percent from 80 percent, said RBC Capital Markets analyst David Palmer.""We believe that the management gets it,"" Palmer said, adding that the question is how long it will take to turn the ship.

HuffstutterCHICAGO, April 28 Tyson Foods Inc, the largest U.S. poultry producer, plans to eliminate the use of human antibiotics in its chicken flocks by September 2017 - one of the most aggressive timelines yet set by an American poultry company.The Arkansas-based chicken and meat giant also said it is working on ways to curtail such on-farm drug practices at its other protein businesses, which include pork and beef.The move marks the latest push by the livestock and food industries to reduce the use of antibiotics crucial to human health in meat production.Authorities are concerned that the routine feeding of antibiotics to animals could spur the creation of antibiotic resistant superbugs in humans, creating a health hazard.Tyson's move, announced on Tuesday morning, aims to help the company meet a deadline recently outlined by McDonald's Corp.  to have its U.S. restaurants gradually stop buying chicken raised with human antibiotics over the next two years.But the company, a key chicken supplier to McDonald's, said in a statement to Reuters that its plans are part of an ongoing effort and ""go beyond one customer."" Tyson said it is also forming working groups with independent farmers, company suppliers, veterinarians and others to talk about how to develop ideas to cut the use of antibiotics vital to fighting human infections in its U.S. beef, pork and turkey supply chains.The working groups will begin meeting this summer.While veterinary use of antibiotics is legal, controversy has grown over the routine feeding of antibiotics that are important to humans to otherwise healthy chicken, cattle and pigs in a bid to stave off disease and help the animals grow more quickly.Tyson said it has already stopped using all antibiotics in its 35 broiler hatcheries and has cut human antibiotics used to treat its broiler chickens by more than 80 percent since 2011. The company said it requires a veterinary prescription when antibiotics are used on its broiler farms. ""Given the progress we've already made reducing antibiotics in our broilers, we believe it's realistic to shoot for zero by the end of our 2017 fiscal year,"" Donnie Smith, president and chief executive of Tyson Foods, said in a statement.INDUSTRY SHIFTS Earlier this month, the Wall Street Journal reported that Pilgrim's Pride Corp., the nation's second-largest U.S. poultry processor, would cut all antibiotics from a quarter of its chicken production by 2019.Rival poultry processor Perdue Farms Inc. told Reuters more than 95 percent of the chickens it produces are raised without antibiotics approved for human use, and more than half are raised with no antibiotics of any kind. Sandwich chain Chick-fil-A in 2014 gave its producers five years to meet its commitment to go antibiotic-free for chicken. Perdue is a major supplier to Chick-fil-A.Tyson has been working with livestock drug companies and others to test a variety of alternatives to antibiotics to protect birds, ranging from probiotics to essential oils derived from plant extracts, the company told Reuters.However, alternatives to human antibiotics are also needed for treating ill birds, the company said. It is providing funds to help accelerate research into disease prevention and antibiotic alternatives to be used on farms.Tyson declined to say how much the company will spend to back such funding of livestock pharmaceuticals and alternatives.Some poultry industry experts say the options for non-human drugs to treat certain diseases in broiler chickens can be limited, and say animal pharmaceutical firms have been slow to invest for the development of new chicken-only antibiotics.Tyson said it plans to meet its 2017 antibiotic-withdrawal timeline, but there could be some exceptions.""We won't jeopardize animal well-being just to get there,"" Smith said.

389,"   By Lisa Baertlein | LOS ANGELES  LOS ANGELES McDonald's new Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook is set to unveil his plan on Monday to revive growth as the world's largest hamburger chain struggles to win back consumers and investors.He'll be aiming to persuade people such as Janna Sampson, co-chief investment officer at OakBrook Investments, which bought McDonald's (MCD.N) shares on the cheap more than a decade ago and eventually held more than 7 million shares as the company spiffed up its restaurants, improved service and expanded its menus with things like fancy coffee, salads and wrap sandwiches.    But Sampson's enthusiasm waned a couple of years ago as quarterly sales at established restaurants started to flag and then fall. In March 2014, OakBrook sold most of its holdings, figuring that McDonald's stock price was too high for a company with no clear strategy for turning its fortunes around.     ""It had not come down enough given the kinds of sales numbers we were seeing,"" said Sampson. The firm favors companies that dominate their industries, as McDonald's still does.Easterbrook has described himself as an ""internal activist"" willing to challenge the status quo to remake McDonald's as a ""modern, progressive burger company.""Most financial analysts who cover McDonald's are on the sidelines. Twenty have ""hold"" ratings on the stock, one is at ""sell"" and seven are at ""buy"" or higher, according to Thomson Reuters data.     They expect Easterbrook to outline more corporate cost cuts, sales of restaurants to franchisees and steps to simplify its menu. He may also elaborate on plans to experiment with customized sandwiches and new mobile technologies. Among options traders, bullish bets on McDonald's turnaround plan picked up last week. [ID: nL1N0XS19N]Some analysts said Easterbrook has what it takes to overcome McDonald's challenges.""Management is doing what it can to fix them,"" JPMorgan analyst John Ivankoe, who has an ""overweight"" rating on McDonald's shares, wrote in a recent note. ""This is obviously a turnaround that will take time.""Other industry experts say the company needs to address what some franchisees have called an identity crisis rooted in its desire to be all things to all people. Rivals such as Wendy's Co (WEN.O), which has wooed hard-core fast-food fans with more indulgent dishes, and Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (CMG.N), which has catered to customers seeking healthier fare, have been far more successful at adapting to changing tastes.       ""They need a long-term concept and a brand make-over,"" said Gary Shamis, a leader in the restaurant practice at accounting firm BDO.     ""The entire dining spectrum has gone through a revolution,"" said Shamis, who personally owned McDonald's shares for 18 years before selling in late 2014. ""It's a different world today.""Last year, when McDonald's net income tumbled 15 percent, was one of the worst in company history. The company's stock now has one of the lowest price-to-earnings ratios in the fast-food sector at about 20 times 2015 estimated earnings.      That's still too rich for Sampson, who said her firm bought into McDonald's at a P/E of 9 in 2003 and would need it to be below 15 to give the stock a serious look.       ""It will take time for changes to be implemented and for customers to recognize those changes,"" said Morningstar restaurant analyst R.J. Hottovy. ""At this point, it's a 'show me' story for McDonald's.""  (Reporting by Lisa Baertlein and Nayan Das in Bengaluru.

""I will not shy away from the urgent need to reset this business,"" said Easterbrook, who took the helm on March 1, following one of McDonald's most dismal years on record.    Shares were down nearly 2 percent in premarket trading, and closed 1.7 percent lower at $96.13 on the New York Stock Exchange as investors digested the news.""Judging by the immediate investor reaction, there appears to be more of a 'prove it' sentiment among investors, rather than an full embrace of Mr. Easterbrook's plan,"" Miller Tabak & Co analyst Stephen Anderson said in a client note.Easterbrook said McDonald's will sell 3,500 restaurants to franchisees by 2018, taking global franchisee ownership to 90 percent from 81 percent. McDonald's prior plan called for selling 1,500 restaurants by 2016. He vowed to remove ""cumbersome"" management and scour the business for inefficiencies to find about $300 million in net annual savings, most of which will be realized by the end of 2017.Easterbrook also said McDonald's would return $8 billion to $9 billion to shareholders in 2015.McDonald's currently organizes its business around major geographic markets: the United States, Europe, and Asia/Pacific, the Middle East and Africa (APMEA). Easterbrook said the new segments, which become effective July 1, will be organized around business similarities.    The U.S. market, which accounts for more than 40 percent of McDonald's operating income, will continue to be led by Mike Andres.The new ""international lead"" market will include Australia, Canada, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom, which make up a total of 40 percent of McDonald's operating income. It will be led by Doug Goare, current president of McDonald's Europe. Dave Hoffman, now president of McDonald's APMEA unit, will lead a new ""high-growth"" market that includes China, Italy, Poland, Russia, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland and the Netherlands. Those countries account for about 10 percent of operating income. The ""foundational"" market includes the remaining countries where McDonald's operates. It will be run by Ian Borden, currently APMEA's chief financial officer.

""No consumer has ever made a decision to buy a brand based on the structure and organization of a company,"" said Light.    ""What is the focus of the brand?

Easterbrook, who most recently was McDonald's global chief brand officer, won kudos for turning around the company's UK business in a prior role and has vowed to transform McDonald's into a ""modern, progressive burger company.""  Easterbrook told reporters that means a ""better McDonald's"" that is more convenient, more enjoyable to visit and offers diners the chance to customize their food.""Modern is meeting needs of consumers today.

Earlier on Monday, Easterbrook announced a partnership to deliver McDonald's food to homes and offices in Manhattan. He previously has announced plans to trim and localize menus, to remove important human antibiotics from chickens raised for McDonald's U.S. restaurants, to raise pay for crew in company-run restaurants and tests of custom sandwiches and all-day breakfast.

""Things in Europe seem pretty calm, we haven't heard anything out of China, and against that backdrop, some of the earnings reports are looking better.""Cognizant surged 6.15 percent after the IT services provider reported a better-than-expected rise in revenue and raised its full-year forecast. Seven of the 10 S&P sectors were positive, with the financials index gaining 0.98 percent and the utilities index 0.73 percent higher, with investors attracted by relatively high dividends.With three-quarters of corporate earnings reports in, Wall Street is now trying to divine when the U.S. Federal Reserve will begin raising interest rates. An April payroll report due on Friday could give a hint.While new orders for U.S. factory goods recorded their biggest increase in eight months in March, the underlying trend remained weak against the backdrop of a strong dollar, a further sign that a rebound in economic growth would not be as strong as last year. Monday's rally in utilities suggested some investors believe the Fed will not raise rates soon and may be looking for yield, Jankovskis said.

400,"   By Lisa Baertlein | LOS ANGELES  LOS ANGELES McDonald's Corp (MCD.N), which is testing a variety of new food products as part of its turnaround effort, on Wednesday said nine southern California restaurants are trying out breakfast bowls made with what is becoming a state dietary staple: kale. One of the breakfast bowls is made with turkey sausage, egg white, kale and spinach and the other includes chorizo and egg. Both are priced around $4, McDonald's spokeswoman Lisa McComb said.Kale, touted as a nutrient-rich ""superfood,"" over the last five years has been growing in popularity in the United States, both in grocery produce aisles and on restaurant menus.     McDonald's rivals Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (CMG.N) and other quick-service chains such as Yum Brands Inc's (YUM.N) Taco Bell over the past few years have helped popularize bowls, which are typically made with meat or another protein, rice or another starch and vegetables. Separately, Janney Capital Markets analyst Mark Kalinowski  said in a client note on Wednesday that McDonald's restaurants in Canada will soon begin offering three salads made with kale as an ingredient.McDonald's declined to comment directly on Kalinowski's Canada kale news, saying that the company is constantly testing new products.  ""We'll share news on our menu when the time is right,"" McComb said.Adding kale to menus would be a significant departure from the norm at the world's biggest fast-food chain. Earlier this year McDonald's aired a burger ad that advised: ""All vegetarians, foodies and gastronauts kindly avert your eyes. You can't get juiciness like this from soy or quinoa."" The ad then flashed to the lettuce on the burger and the announcer said: ""Nor will that ever be kale.""

The return of the Hamburglar, now a young suburban father, coincides with McDonald's limited-time sirloin one-third pound hamburger.

403,"   By Sinead Carew  Labor expenses will be a key focus during retailers' earnings conference calls in the coming weeks, with many companies under pressure to boost workers' wages at a time when low U.S. unemployment levels have given workers more leverage.Wal-Mart (WMT.N), Target Corp (TGT.N), T.J. Maxx (TJX.N), Gap (GPS.N), and McDonald's Corp (MCD.N) have already announced wage increases, and the trend appears to be trickling further into the retail and restaurant sectors.""The competition for that job is tougher for the employer. The employee has choices now,"" said Thomas Sudyka, managing director at investment management firm Lawson Kroeker based in Omaha, Nebraska.So far in this reporting season, companies such as Bed Bath & Beyond Inc (BBBY.O) and Buffalo Wild Wings Inc (BWLD.O) have discussed wage pressure, while Pier 1 Imports Inc (PIR.N) plans incentive pay for the first time in three years. Fast-food workers have been vocal in fighting for better wages. They rallied in U.S. cities on April 15 to demand higher pay, using the deadline for filing tax returns to publicize their argument that they cannot survive on the hourly wages paid by many U.S. corporations.The U.S. government said Friday U.S. job growth rebounded last month and the unemployment rate dropped to a near seven-year low of 5.4 percent, while average hourly earnings rose three cents in April, a year-on-year gain of 2.2 percent. RESULTS  Big retailers reporting in the week starting May 13 include Macys Inc (M.N), Nordstrom Inc (JWN.N) and Kohl's Corp (KSS.N). The following week, Home Depot (HD.N), Wal-Mart, Staples Inc (SPLS.O), Target and Gap are due to report. Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O) and Tiffany & Co (TIF.N) both report on May 27.Macys, Kohl's and Home Depot say they set their wages on a market-by-market basis as the competitive situation varies around the country. Kohl's said it also watches other factors driving employee decisions, such as the work environment and future opportunities for advancement.  Staples in March discussed a 2014 cash build-up for incentive compensation that would be paid out in 2015 but it did not give details. Bed Bath & Beyond said during a conference call early in April it had planned for an additional expense of 6 cents a share this year due to increased compensation. Analysts expect Bed Bath & Beyond to earn about $1.91 per share this year on a fully reported basis, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. ""We are modeling an increase in our investments in compensation and benefits beyond what we have always historically planned for, to continue to assure that we preserve our ability to attract, and retain, the best associates,"" Sue Lattmann, the company's chief financial officer told investors.HIGHER WAGES, HIGHER COSTS  Many companies will try to cut other costs, or raise prices where they can to absorb the extra expense of higher wages, said Lawson Kroeker's Sudyka.During its quarterly conference call on April 28, Buffalo Wild Wings told investors it faced pressure to raise the salaries of minimum wage workers as well as higher-paid workers. There were also additional labor costs from the creation of new roles aimed at boosting sales.  Chief Operating Officer James Schmidt told investors that ""if labor has to be a little higher, but it's driving higher same-store sales, we would look and try to look at other lines of the (profit and loss statement) where we can recapture that.""Some analysts said investors will likely take wage increases in their stride, as better pay should translate to improved sales, with consumers having more money to spend.""Even if companies can't pass on the costs, it's a one-time hit and we can grow from there,"" Sudyka said.

404,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, May 08 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has downgraded the Issuer Default Ratings  (IDRs) of McDonald's Corporation (NYSE: MCD) to 'BBB+/F2' from 'A/F1'. The  Rating Outlook is Stable. At March 31, 2015, McDonald's had $14.3 billion of  total debt. A full list of ratings is provided at the end of this release. KEY RATINGS DRIVERS Materially Higher Leverage Anticipated The downgrade reflects Fitch's view that McDonald's has become more aggressive  with its financial strategy and also concerns about continued sales declines,  market share losses, and brand strength going-forward. McDonald's plans to  return $8 billion to $9 billion of cash to shareholders via dividends and share  repurchases in 2015 and to achieve the high end of its three-year $18 billion to  $20 billion cash return target by the end of 2016.  Given softness in its business, as evidenced by weak first quarter results,  McDonald's will have to incur substantial debt to satisfy its cash return goal.  Fitch projects that total debt/EBITDA and total adjusted debt/operating EBITDAR  will increase to the low 2.0x and 3.0x range by the end of 2015, up from 1.5x  and 2.6x for the LTM period ended March 31, 2015.  Fitch has taken into consideration the potential for meaningful cash proceeds  and margin accretion from refranchising 3,500 company-operated units by 2018 and  the $300 million of annual net G&A savings expected by 2017. However, the pace  at which benefits from refranchising will be realized is uncertain, and it is  Fitch's view that management may be willing to maintain higher amounts of  leverage going forward.  Persistently Weak Same-Store Sales Trends During the quarter ended March 31, 2015, McDonald's global SSS were negative  2.3% with declines across all major geographic segments. Global guest counts  fell 4.7%, an acceleration versus the 3.1% decline in the comparable period last  year. McDonald's global SSS have been weak for more than two consecutive years.  Fitch views a cohesive and aggressive system-wide effort to improve service,  emphasize food quality and provide locally-relevant menu variety as necessary  catalysts for SSS growth. However, due to McDonald's significant size, the need  to solidify the support of franchisees and reputational challenges both  domestically and following supply chain issues in Asia, Fitch believes changes  will take time and be challenging to implement and to resonate with consumers.  Efforts in the U.S. include simplifying its menu to improve service and provide  flexibility to address local customer preferences while also introducing new  higher quality food items nationally. In order to appeal to health conscious  consumers, McDonald's announced plans to serve only antibiotic-free chicken in  the U.S. within two years. The company also recently rolled out a new sirloin  burger and is testing a new customizable burger platform in the U.S. called  Taste Crafted. Fitch believes improving the brand's perception in the burger  category could prove challenging given increasing levels of competition from a  growing number of smaller faster growing chains.  Significant Restructuring Under Way  On May 4, 2015, McDonald's new CEO outlined initial steps of his plan to  turnaround performance. The company's first priority is to address operational  issues, but management also plans to continue to evaluate opportunities to  enhance shareholder value. Fitch believes the May 4 announcement provided few  additional specifics on how McDonald's will improve consumers' perception of its  food but instead focused on organizational changes, becoming 90% franchised  globally, and boosting shareholder returns.  McDonald's will realign its business into four market segments to better share  ideas and speed decision making across geographies. Segments include the U.S.,  International Lead Markets (Australia, Canada, France, Germany and the U.K),  High-Growth Markets (China, Italy, Poland, Russia, South Korea, Spain,  Switzerland and the Netherlands), and Foundational Markets (the remaining  markets within McDonald's system). In addition, as mentioned previously, the  company also intends to accelerate cash returned to shareholders in 2015,  refranchise 3,500 company units by 2018, and reduce annualize G&A by $300  million by 2017. Substantial but Declining Cash Flow  McDonald's generates substantial cash flow from operations. However, CFO  declined 11% during the first quarter of 2015, after declining 5% in 2014 to  $6.4 billion due to lower sales and operating income. McDonald's is slowing new  unit growth to focus on regaining sales momentum. 2015 Capex guidance is  approximately $2 billion, down from $2.6 billion in 2014 and a high of $3  billion in 2012. Free cash flow (FCF - defined as CFO less capex less dividends)  remains meaningful, totaling $931 million in 2014 and $490 million in the first  quarter of 2015, but Fitch expects FCF to be deployed towards share buybacks.  Liquidity and Maturities  McDonald's liquidity is supported by its large cash balance, FCF, and an undrawn  revolving credit facility that expires December 2019. At March 31, 2015,  liquidity totaled $4.1 billion and consisted of $1.6 billion of cash and $2.5  billion revolver availability. At the year ended Dec. 31, 2014, debt maturities  approximated $1.1 billion in 2015, $823 million in 2016, and $1 billion in 2017  based on year-end currency rates. Fitch currently expects debt maturities to be  refinanced given McDonald's shareholder friendly activities. KEY ASSUMPTIONS --Low single-digit SSS declines continue in the near term; --Margins contract in 2015 but expand meaningfully thereafter due to  refranchising and cost reductions; --Operating cash flow growth does not resume until 2016; --Total debt-to-operating EBITDA and total adjusted debt-to-operating EBITDAR  (defined as total debt plus 8x gross rents-to-operating EBITDA plus gross rents)  approximate the low 2.0x and low 3.0x range in 2015 and declines only modestly  thereafter, assuming no material debt paydown.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a negative  rating action include:  --SSS declines accelerate and remain negative beyond 2015; --Margin contraction continues post 2015 due to continued weak operating results  and a slower than expected pace of refranchising; --Total debt-to-operating EBITDA and total adjusted debt-to-operating EBITDAR  sustained above the mid-2.0x and mid-3.0x range, respectively. Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a positive  rating action include:  --A sustained period of SSS growth; --Margins stabilize or expand significantly due to operating earnings growth or  refranchising; --Total debt-to-operating EBITDA and total adjusted debt-to-operating EBITDAR is  sustained below at or below 2.0x and 3.0x, respectively due to operating income  growth or debt reduction.  Fitch has downgraded McDonald's ratings as follows:  --Long-term IDR to 'BBB+' from 'A'; --Bank credit facilities at to 'BBB+' from 'A'; --Senior unsecured debt to 'BBB+' from 'A'; --Short-term IDR to 'F2' from 'F1'; --Commercial paper to 'F2' from 'F1'.

408,"   By Sinead Carew  Labor expenses will be a key focus during retailers' earnings conference calls in the coming weeks, with many companies under pressure to boost workers' wages at a time when low U.S. unemployment levels have given workers more leverage.Wal-Mart (WMT.N), Target Corp (TGT.N), T.J. Maxx (TJX.N), Gap (GPS.N), and McDonald's Corp (MCD.N) have already announced wage increases, and the trend appears to be trickling further into the retail and restaurant sectors.""The competition for that job is tougher for the employer. The employee has choices now,"" said Thomas Sudyka, managing director at investment management firm Lawson Kroeker based in Omaha, Nebraska.So far in this reporting season, companies such as Bed Bath & Beyond Inc (BBBY.O) and Buffalo Wild Wings Inc (BWLD.O) have discussed wage pressure, while Pier 1 Imports Inc (PIR.N) plans incentive pay for the first time in three years. Fast-food workers have been vocal in fighting for better wages. They rallied in U.S. cities on April 15 to demand higher pay, using the deadline for filing tax returns to publicize their argument that they cannot survive on the hourly wages paid by many U.S. corporations.The U.S. government said Friday U.S. job growth rebounded last month and the unemployment rate dropped to a near seven-year low of 5.4 percent, while average hourly earnings rose three cents in April, a year-on-year gain of 2.2 percent. RESULTS  Big retailers reporting in the week starting May 13 include Macys Inc (M.N), Nordstrom Inc (JWN.N) and Kohl's Corp (KSS.N). The following week, Home Depot (HD.N), Wal-Mart, Staples Inc (SPLS.O), Target and Gap are due to report. Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O) and Tiffany & Co (TIF.N) both report on May 27.Macys, Kohl's and Home Depot say they set their wages on a market-by-market basis as the competitive situation varies around the country. Kohl's said it also watches other factors driving employee decisions, such as the work environment and future opportunities for advancement.  Staples in March discussed a 2014 cash build-up for incentive compensation that would be paid out in 2015 but it did not give details. Bed Bath & Beyond said during a conference call early in April it had planned for an additional expense of 6 cents a share this year due to increased compensation. Analysts expect Bed Bath & Beyond to earn about $1.91 per share this year on a fully reported basis, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. ""We are modeling an increase in our investments in compensation and benefits beyond what we have always historically planned for, to continue to assure that we preserve our ability to attract, and retain, the best associates,"" Sue Lattmann, the company's chief financial officer told investors.HIGHER WAGES, HIGHER COSTS  Many companies will try to cut other costs, or raise prices where they can to absorb the extra expense of higher wages, said Lawson Kroeker's Sudyka.During its quarterly conference call on April 28, Buffalo Wild Wings told investors it faced pressure to raise the salaries of minimum wage workers as well as higher-paid workers. There were also additional labor costs from the creation of new roles aimed at boosting sales.  Chief Operating Officer James Schmidt told investors that ""if labor has to be a little higher, but it's driving higher same-store sales, we would look and try to look at other lines of the (profit and loss statement) where we can recapture that.""Some analysts said investors will likely take wage increases in their stride, as better pay should translate to improved sales, with consumers having more money to spend.""Even if companies can't pass on the costs, it's a one-time hit and we can grow from there,"" Sudyka said.

415,"  (Adds confirmation of filing, McDonald's, SEIU comment)By Lisa BaertleinLOS ANGELES May 18 The Service Employees International Union, backer of a three-year campaign to improve the plight of low-wage fast-food and retail workers, on Monday petitioned the Federal Trade Commission to investigate alleged abusive practices by major franchisors, including McDonald's Corp and 7-Eleven Inc.SEIU's petition outlined six U.S. franchisor practices it called endemic and ""particularly harmful"" in the latest salvo in a broad campaign to pressure McDonald's Corp to improve working conditions and raise wages for restaurant employees, who also are seeking to unionize.The union, which has roughly 2 million members, said those practices include incomplete or misleading financial performance representations, unreasonable capital expenditure demands, retaliation against members of independent franchisee organizations, unfair termination, unfair non-renewal, and interference with transfers or sales.""An FTC investigation could help curb harmful and predatory franchisor practices, giving franchisees space to create good jobs and grow the economy,"" said Scott Courtney, assistant to the SEIU's president. A spokesman for the FTC did not immediately respond to requests for comment.McDonald's spokeswoman Lisa McComb called SEIU's latest action ""ironic,"" since the protests it backs have disrupted the restaurant operations of the same franchisees the union now seeks to form an alliance with.""McDonald's has a strong working relationship with our 3,100 independent franchisees,"" McComb said. Still, there appears to discontent in the ranks of McDonald's franchisees. A small but influential survey published in April suggested that relations between McDonald's U.S. franchisees and the fast-food giant had hit a new low.Franchisees complained in the anonymous poll that requirements for renovations and other upgrades, such as McDonald's new ""Create Your Taste"" custom burger program, burden them with substantial debt.McDonald's in March got a new chief executive to lead a turnaround of the company's business, which has weakened due to fierce competition, changing consumer appetites and internal missteps. Franchisor 7-Eleven, owned by Tokyo-based Seven & I Holdings Co, has been hit with lawsuits from franchisees who alleged it invented reasons to take away their convenience stores.A 7-Eleven spokeswoman previously told Reuters those allegations were false.SEIU, which separately is seeking to hold McDonald's liable for alleged labor violations by franchisees, is backing a proposed law in California that would make it more difficult for franchisors to terminate agreements with franchisees.Last year, California's governor vetoed a bill that would have helped franchisees recoup some of their business investments when a franchisor wrongly terminates their relationship.(Editing by Eric Walsh and Alan Crosby)",2015-05-18,MCD,"Mon May 18, 2015 | 3:44pm EDT",UPDATE 1-SEIU seeks FTC probe of McDonald's and other franchisors,http://www.reuters.com//article/mcdonalds-ftc-idUSL1N0Y91AN20150518?type=companyNews

Among other things, McDonald's franchisees have complained that the company's requirements for renovations and kitchen upgrades have burdened them with substantial debt.Most recently, U.S. franchisees have complained about McDonald's new ""Create Your Taste"" customization project. Among other things, they say that it carries a price tag that is too high for a program that does not work in drive-thrus, which account for more than 60 percent of U.S. restaurant sales. McDonald's, which is also testing a more modest customization program that is available through drive-thru windows, in the past has said it has a ""solid working relationship"" with its franchisees.Separately, franchisor 7-Eleven, owned by Tokyo-based Seven & I Holdings Co, has been hit with lawsuits in which franchisees alleged that it drummed up reasons to take away their convenience stores. A 7-Eleven spokeswoman previously told Reuters that those allegations were false and that the company ends relationships with the ""few franchisees who violate the law or the franchise agreement"" to protect other franchisees, employees and customers.SEIU currently is backing a proposed law in California that would make it more difficult for franchisors to terminate agreements with franchisees.Last year, California Governor Jerry Brown vetoed a bill that would have helped franchisees recoup some of their business investments when a franchisor wrongly terminates their relationship.

418,"   By Alex Dobuzinskis | LOS ANGELES  LOS ANGELES The Los Angeles City Council voted on Tuesday to increase the minimum wage in the nation's second-largest city to $15 an hour by 2020 from the current $9, in a victory for labor and community groups that have pushed for similar pay hikes in several U.S. municipalities.The council's 14-1 vote on the measure, which must come back before the panel for final approval, would require businesses with more than 25 employees to meet the $15 pay level by 2020, while smaller businesses would have an extra year to comply.Officials said the plan, which comes on the heels of similar minimum wage hikes in other major cities including Seattle and San Francisco, would increase pay of an estimated 800,000 workers in the city.""We are embarking upon, I think, the most progressive minimum wage policy anywhere in the country,"" City Councilman Curren Price Jr., one of the main backers of the proposal, said before the vote.With the federal minimum wage stagnant at $7.25 an hour since 2009, labor and religious groups have increasingly pressed local governments in liberal-leaning areas to enact their own minimum wage hikes even as their hopes dim for an increase from the Republican-controlled U.S. Congress. The proposal given preliminary approval in Los Angeles, where housing costs are among the highest in the nation, represents a far-reaching victory for supporters of higher pay for low-wage workers.   The 67-percent pay increase would be implemented gradually, starting at $10.50 an hour for larger employers in 2016, and gradually going up each year until it reaches $15 in 2020. Companies with 25 or fewer workers would follow a slightly slower stepped-up increase in minimum wage pay.Opponents of minimum wage hikes, such as Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce senior vice president of public policy Ruben Gonzalez, say they place an undue burden on businesses, and would force employers to lay off workers or move. ""There is simply not enough room, enough margin in these businesses to absorb a 50-plus percent increase in labor costs over a short period of time,"" he told the city council.Mayor Eric Garcetti, who last year proposed a pay increase that would have brought the minimum wage to $13.25 by 2017, said in a statement that he planned to sign the council's measure.Other cities have also moved to increase their minimum wages in phases. Seattle is phasing in a pay hike that would bring the minimum wage to $15 an hour over the next two to six years, depending on the size of the business. Voters in San Francisco have approved raising their minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2018.The San Francisco Bay Area city of Emeryville has given preliminary approval to gradually increase its minimum wage to $16 an hour by 2019, in what would be the nation's highest such minimum pay. The city council is scheduled to vote on Tuesday evening on whether to give that final approval.Chicago city leaders last year approved raising its minimum wage to $13 by 2019, and New York Mayor Bill de Blasio has called for raising the minimum wage in his city to about $15 by 2019.

419,"   By Robert Smith  LONDON, May 19 (IFR) - McDonald's bit off more than it could chew in the euro corporate bond market on Monday, forcing it to pull the 20-year tranche of a jumbo bond sale after investors failed to show up.But the US fast food outlet was still able to raise EUR2bn, which alongside a US$2bn deal priced later that day, tees up its accelerated share buyback and dividend payment programme of US$8bn-US$9bn this year.While McDonald's is a frequent issuer in euros, it has previously stuck to issuing no more than EUR500m a time. On Monday, however, it chose to go for a supersize deal, announcing four new tranches, all of benchmark size.This means the firm wanted to raise at least EUR2bn from the bond sale, which was split into a seven-, 12- and 20-year fixed rate tranches alongside a 4.25-year floating rate note.BLOATED MARKET Many in the market said the 20-year was a bold call given the recent chaos in the Bunds market and by late-morning signs emerged that that note was struggling. While overall books had climbed to EUR3.25bn, size expectations on the 20-year had been downsized to EUR300m from EUR500m.By early afternoon leads threw in the towel, pulling the 20-year tranche entirely.Several investors said that they were not surprised. ""Long-dated highly-rated paper is still suffering from the flood of issuance we had at the end of February and first half of March,"" one said. ""Also many of the reverse Yankees are trading wider than where they were issued earlier this year.""A banker on the deal said they had expected the steepness of the proposed curve to help investors get over their reticence for longer-dated paper, with the 20-year mooted at 110bp over mid-swaps compared to 80bp on the 12-year.""The market has been volatile but the long-end isn't completely dead, which I think shows this was somewhat credit specific,"" he said. ""They were downgraded on the back of the share buyback and turnaround plan, and I think this meant there were fewer 20-year buyers than we anticipated despite a steep curve for a Single-A credit.""Moody's, S&P and Fitch have all downgraded McDonald's credit rating this month, to A3/A-/BBB+ from A2/A/A. A banker away from the deal said that Monday was not the day to test demand at the long end, however.""On top of all the recent rates volatility, target buyers had been out for a few days and the overall deal size was ambitious for a company that typically issues only EUR500m tranches,"" he said.""On the plus side, at least they pulled the tranche instead of shafting the few investors who turned up.""HAPPY DEAL?  Despite pulling the 20-year tranche, McDonald's was still able to reach the implied EUR2bn minimum target size through the other three-tranches.The deal was eventually split between a EUR600m 4.25-year FRN at 30bp over three-month Euribor, a EUR800m seven-year fixed at 55bp over mid-swaps and a EUR600m 12-year fixed at 80bp over mid-swaps.This compared to initial price thoughts of 35bp area, 55bp to 60bp, and 80bp area respectively.The banker on the deal said that McDonald's has to raise US$4bn-US$5bn in the near term to fund the share buyback and refinancing needs, which it has achieved with the new euro and dollar jumbo bonds.McDonald's also raised US$2bn of five, 10 and 30-year notes.""We got the size we wanted without the 20-year and we were able to juggle around allocations without stretching the book too much, as secondary levels show,"" he said.The final book on the remaining three-tranches ended up at EUR3bn. The banker said that the FRN and seven-year tranches were bid 1bp tighter with the 12-year trading flat to reoffer.Active bookrunners on the deal were BofA Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley.

Companies such as McDonald's Corp (MCD.N) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) are raising starting pay and cities like Seattle and Chicago are boosting their minimum wages over time.Tyree Johnson, 47, of Chicago joined thousands of others for noisy but peaceful protests outside McDonald's headquarters in the Chicago suburb of Oak Brook on Wednesday.""They keep telling me they value me but they don't give me more money,"" said Johnson, who has worked in McDonald's restaurants since 1992 and says he lives in a men's hotel because he can't afford an apartment on his wage of $8.55 per hour.""We respect their right to peacefully protest,"" McDonald's spokeswoman Heidi Barker Sa Shekhem said. She said the world's largest restaurant chain regularly looks at the wage issue.    Steve Easterbrook, McDonald's new chief executive, last month announced that starting pay at company-operated restaurants would be set at $1 above the locally mandated minimum wage, beginning on July 1. By the end of 2016, McDonald's expects the average hourly pay rate to be above $10 per hour. Those increases only apply to some 90,000 workers at the roughly 1,500 U.S. restaurants McDonald's operates. They do not affect around 660,000 other restaurant workers employed by U.S. McDonald's franchisees. Some workers were quick to criticize the announcement, saying it was too little to make a real difference and affected too few workers. The decision also angered some McDonald's restaurant operators, who said it would put additional cost pressure on franchisees struggling to maintain profits at a time when sales have been weakened by intense competition and internal missteps that have slowed service.The Service Employees International Union (SEIU), which backs the worker protests, also is pressuring McDonald's through legislative and regulatory channels.  On Wednesday, a group of top U.S. pension fund leaders warned that McDonald's and other companies may be jeopardizing their own futures by returning excessive amounts of cash to investors via share buybacks.Twenty-nine states and Washington, D.C., currently have minimum wages above the federal minimum of $7.25 per hour.

422,"   By Tom Polansek | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Sanderson Farms Inc, the third largest U.S. poultry producer, plans to continue using antibiotics on its birds partly because there are no alternatives on the horizon for treating a deadly but common gut disease, Chief Executive Officer Joe Sanderson said on Wednesday.Other major poultry producers, including market leader Tyson Foods Inc, have announced plans to eradicate antibiotics, which are also crucial in human healthcare, from their flocks but have not ruled out their use on sick birds. The debate over the agriculture industry's long-standing practice of using such drugs in livestock production to stave off disease and to promote more rapid growth has heated up in recent years as concerns grow among public health experts and federal regulators that their routine feeding to livestock could create a health hazard by spurring the creation of antibiotic-resistant superbugs in humans.Two of the biggest makers of animal drugs have told Sanderson Farms that developing products to treat the gut disease necrotic enteritis is not profitable enough to justify the effort, the CEO said.Enteritis is treated with antibiotics including virginiamycin and bacitracin. ""They just don't have anything in the pipeline,"" Sanderson added. He declined to identify the companies. Sanderson is concerned the birds would suffer and die from the condition without antibiotics.It costs the companies too much money to develop alternative drugs, he said, adding ""the market is so small it's not worth it."" This week, Sanderson Farms sent a letter to its customers, including retailers and export markets, outlining its reasons for using antibiotics in poultry production, Joe Sanderson said.Tyson plans to eliminate the use of human antibiotics in its chicken flocks by September 2017, one of the most aggressive timetables yet set by an American poultry company.Tyson's move will help the company meet a deadline outlined by McDonald's Corp for its U.S. restaurants to gradually stop buying chicken raised with human antibiotics over the next two years. Tyson has said it plans to push for accelerated research into disease prevention and antibiotic alternatives on farms. The company ""will not let sick animals suffer,"" CEO Donnie Smith said last month.Sanderson told investors at a separate conference earlier this month that ""there's no evidence whatsoever that using these antibiotics really does cause antibiotic resistance bacteria,"" according to a transcript of the event.

423,"   By Ross Kerber and Lisa Baertlein | BOSTON/LOS ANGELES  BOSTON/LOS ANGELES Four U.S. public pension fund officials on Wednesday warned that McDonald's Corp and other companies may be jeopardizing their own futures by returning excessive amounts of cash to investors via share buybacks.The statement by the fund officials marks the first time in which some of the nation's biggest institutional investors have joined up to urge companies to rethink their focus on immediate returns and aim for long-term growth.The four officials - New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer, New York state Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli, Chicago Treasurer Kurt Summers and California Controller Betty Yee - are fiduciaries to pension funds with $860 billion in assets. Yee is on the boards of both the California Public Employees’ Retirement System and the California State Teachers’ Retirement System.The statement singled out McDonald's and comes a day ahead of the fast-food chain's annual shareholders meeting.It said McDonald's is continuing an ""aggressive"" share buyback program even as it begins an overhaul of its operations.The drive by the four officials runs counter to calls for more payouts from high-profile activist investors, including some that recently disclosed stakes in McDonald's, which could set up a clash over how the country's largest restaurant chain allocates capital. The pension leaders, in the statement, said that companies' productivity and wage growth had once matched and helped drive prosperity.""Today, however, 95 percent of corporate earnings are being distributed to shareowners, prompting us to question whether companies are adequately reinvesting for sustainable returns over the long-term,"" they said. ""If the pendulum swings too far in favor of returning capital to shareowners, the future viability of the companies in which we invest may be placed at risk."" The statement referred to ""serious performance challenges"" at McDonald's.McDonald's Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook, who took over the top spot on March 1, earlier this month announced a turnaround strategy that included returning up to $9 billion to investors through dividends and share repurchases.Representatives for McDonald's were not immediately available to comment on the statement from the pension fund officials.Recent filings showed new shareholders in McDonald's include activist investors Jana Partners LLC and Corvex Management LP, which have pushed for share buybacks elsewhere. Neither would comment about the restaurant chain. DON'T OVERDO IT McDonald's annual meeting on Thursday, at its headquarters in Oak Brook, Illinois, is to include a shareholder vote on a measure known as ""proxy access"" that would make it easier for small groups of shareholders to run director candidates.McDonald's board opposes proxy access and said it could open the door to what it called ""special-interest"" candidates. In their statement the four pension fund officials said proxy access would help ""hold boards accountable when they place short-term interests ahead of long-term value creation."" Share buybacks have come under increasing scrutiny as academics and politicians criticize them as potentially short-sighted and argue that more profits should be used to shore up companies' long-term growth and improve wages for employees. Last year Laurence Fink, CEO of BlackRock Inc, the world's largest asset manager, warned companies against overdoing dividends and buybacks at the expense of future growth. In April, U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin, a Democrat of Wisconsin, asked securities regulators to review buyback rules.From 2003 to 2012 S&P 500 companies used 54 percent of their earnings to buy back stock, or $2.4 trillion, with dividends absorbing another 37 percent of earnings, according to a paper by University of Massachusetts Lowell Professor William Lazonick published in the Harvard Business Review late last year.""That left very little for investments in productive capabilities or higher incomes for employees,"" Lazonick wrote.On the other side of the debate, a generation of activist investors have had success pressing companies to step up buybacks and to increase dividends, both meant to boost returns amid a soft economic recovery.Under pressure from billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn, for example, Apple boosted its repurchase program in April to $140 billion from $90 billion last year. Icahn this week said he is again pressing to increase that amount.

Icahn this week said he is again pressing to increase that amount.

426,"   By Alex Dobuzinskis | LOS ANGELES  LOS ANGELES The Los Angeles City Council voted on Tuesday to increase the minimum wage in the nation's second-largest city to $15 an hour by 2020 from the current $9, in a victory for labor and community groups that have pushed for similar pay hikes in several U.S. municipalities.The council's 14-1 vote on the measure, which must come back before the panel for final approval, would require businesses with more than 25 employees to meet the $15 pay level by 2020, while smaller businesses would have an extra year to comply.Officials said the plan, which comes on the heels of similar minimum wage hikes in other major cities including Seattle and San Francisco, would increase pay of an estimated 800,000 workers in the city.""We are embarking upon, I think, the most progressive minimum wage policy anywhere in the country,"" City Councilman Curren Price Jr., one of the main backers of the proposal, said before the vote.With the federal minimum wage stagnant at $7.25 an hour since 2009, labor and religious groups have increasingly pressed local governments in liberal-leaning areas to enact their own minimum wage hikes even as their hopes dim for an increase from the Republican-controlled U.S. Congress. The proposal given preliminary approval in Los Angeles, where housing costs are among the highest in the nation, represents a far-reaching victory for supporters of higher pay for low-wage workers.   The 67-percent pay increase would be implemented gradually, starting at $10.50 an hour for larger employers in 2016, and gradually going up each year until it reaches $15 in 2020. Companies with 25 or fewer workers would follow a slightly slower stepped-up increase in minimum wage pay.Opponents of minimum wage hikes, such as Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce senior vice president of public policy Ruben Gonzalez, say they place an undue burden on businesses, and would force employers to lay off workers or move. ""There is simply not enough room, enough margin in these businesses to absorb a 50-plus percent increase in labor costs over a short period of time,"" he told the city council.Mayor Eric Garcetti, who last year proposed a pay increase that would have brought the minimum wage to $13.25 by 2017, said in a statement that he planned to sign the council's measure.Other cities have also moved to increase their minimum wages in phases. Seattle is phasing in a pay hike that would bring the minimum wage to $15 an hour over the next two to six years, depending on the size of the business. Voters in San Francisco have approved raising their minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2018.The San Francisco Bay Area city of Emeryville has given preliminary approval to gradually increase its minimum wage to $16 an hour by 2019, in what would be the nation's highest such minimum pay. The city council is scheduled to vote on Tuesday evening on whether to give that final approval.Chicago city leaders last year approved raising its minimum wage to $13 by 2019, and New York Mayor Bill de Blasio has called for raising the minimum wage in his city to about $15 by 2019.

427,"   By Mary Wisniewski | CHICAGO  CHICAGO May 20 Thousands of McDonald's workers seeking a minimum wage of $15 per hour and the right to unionize are expected to swarm the fast-food giant's headquarters for two days of protests that will coincide with the fast-food chain's annual meeting on Thursday.Protests by low-wage fast-food and retail workers have helped fuel a national debate about pay levels. Companies such as McDonald's Corp and Wal-Mart Stores Inc are raising starting pay and cities like Seattle and Chicago are boosting their respective minimum wages over time.Oak Brook, Illinois, police are preparing for thousands of demonstrators on Wednesday at the chain's suburban headquarters west of Chicago, and a smaller crowd in the hundreds on Thursday, said Officer Garrett Church. In one of his first major announcements as the new chief executive of McDonald's, Steve Easterbrook last month said that starting pay at company-operated restaurants would be set at $1 above the locally mandated minimum wage, beginning on July 1. By the end of 2016, McDonald's expects the average hourly pay rate to be above $10 per hour.Those increases only apply to some 90,000 workers at the roughly 1,500 U.S. restaurants McDonald's operates. They do not affect around 660,000 other restaurant workers employed by U.S. McDonald's franchisees who operate about 12,500 restaurants. Some workers were quick to criticize the announcement. They said it was too little to make a real difference and affected too few workers. The decision also angered some McDonald's restaurant operators, who said it would put additional cost pressure on franchisees struggling to maintain profits at a time when sales have been weakened by intense competition and internal missteps that have slowed service.This week's protests are backed by the Service Employees International Union (SEIU), which has spent tens of millions of dollars so far on a three-year campaign to improve conditions for low-wage retail and fast-food workers.Twenty-nine states and Washington, D.C. currently have minimum wages above the federal minimum of $7.25 per hour, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

428,"   By Lisa Baertlein and Ross Kerber | LOS ANGELES/BOSTON  LOS ANGELES/BOSTON McDonald's Corp (MCD.N) shareholders defied executives at its annual meeting on Thursday, approving a proposal to make it easier to nominate directors to the board of the fast-food chain and taking its new CEO to task over wages, advertising and its food. McDonald's Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook, who took the helm on March 1, is fighting on numerous fronts as he works to turn around the company, which saw profit and revenue fall in 2014 after service times slowed and nimbler rivals picked off  customers with menus that appeal to growing appetites for fresher, less-processed food. Despite opposition from McDonald's, 61 percent of voting shareholders said yes to a proposal that would make it easier for long-term investors to list director candidates on company proxy materials.  The UAW Retiree Medical Benefits Trust brought the proxy access proposal before investors because ""McDonald's board needs to be more accountable for these performance lapses,"" the Trust's Corporate Governance Director Cambria Allen said at the meeting, which was closed to media but accessible via webcast.Thousands of protesters swarmed McDonald's headquarters for two days of rallies that are part of a multi-year, union-supported campaign for better wages and working conditions at the world's biggest restaurant chain.The day before the meeting, New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer and three other officials who are fiduciaries to large public pension funds challenged McDonald's and other companies, saying they might be jeopardizing their own futures by returning excessive amounts of cash to investors via the buybacks. Earlier this month, Easterbrook said McDonald's turnaround plan would include returning up to $9 billion to investors through dividends and share repurchases. Stringer called proxy access at McDonald's ""the perfect antidote for a board whose turnaround plan prioritizes share buybacks over long-term value creation.""During Thursday's meeting, activists asked the company to make its actions match its public message.Chicago Teachers Union Vice President Jesse Sharkey called on McDonald's to ""stop pretending to support values for the public good while simultaneously undermining those policies with its political contributions.""The union introduced a shareholder proposal requesting an annual ""congruency analysis"" of company values and political contributions. It did not pass. While Easterbrook recently announced plans to raise pay for some 90,000 workers in company-run restaurants, Sharkey said the company ""simultaneously undermines efforts to raise the minimum wage across the country with large support through the National Restaurant Association (NRA),"" a deep-pocketed industry group that lobbies against such increases as well as food policy changes.""McDonald's is exposing its share owners and business to significant reputational risks by continuing to say one thing and do another,"" Sharkey said.Easterbrook told meeting attendees he was proud of the move the company made regarding crew wages in the restaurants it operates. He said the pay of some 660,000 other McDonald's restaurant workers was up to the franchisees who employ them. He did not address the NRA contributions. Others shareholders, including three nuns, appealed to Easterbrook to take concrete steps toward serving healthier food, moving to sustainable palm oil and cutting important human antibiotics from the production of all of the meats it serves.Casey Hinds of Seattle criticized McDonald's prior CEO Don Thompson for saying at last year's annual meeting that McDonald's was not marketing to schools - despite company fundraising programs such as ""McTeacher's Night."" She warned that continuing the disconnect was hurting the company's reputation with key customers.

435,"  (Repeats story for wider distribution, no change to text)By Lisa Baertlein and Ross KerberLOS ANGELES/BOSTON May 21 McDonald's Corp  shareholders will vote Thursday on a proposal that would make it easier to nominate directors to the board of the fast-food chain, which is in turnaround mode after losing customers and sales to competition and after internal missteps.Investor support for such new director nomination rules, referred to as ""proxy access,"" is growing.The California Public Employees' Retirement System (Calpers) and the New York City Pension Funds have urged shareholders to vote for proxy access at McDonald's, and influential proxy advisory firms Institutional Investor Services and Glass Lewis & Co have recommended that their clients support it.Vanguard Group and BlackRock Inc, major investors that hold significant stakes in McDonald's, have publicly backed proxy access. McDonald's opposes the proposal, which was filed by the UAW Retiree Medical Benefits Trust.""We believe that making McDonald's leadership at the board level more accountable to shareholders ensures that the board is the strongest it can be to usher in a new chapter of prosperity for the benefit of the company, its employees, and shareholders,"" said Meredith Miller, chief corporate governance officer, UAW Retiree Medical Benefits Trust. New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer and three other officials who are fiduciaries to public pension funds with a total of $860 billion in assets are challenging McDonald's and other companies on stock buybacks.Stringer called proxy access at McDonald's ""the perfect antidote for a board whose turnaround plan prioritizes share buybacks over long-term value creation.""The proxy access thresholds proposed at McDonald's would allow groups of shareholders holding at least three percent of company stock for at least three years to be able to list director candidates on company proxy materials. That would give longer-term shareholders with limited resources more power to hold directors accountable, Miller said. McDonald's encouraged shareholders to reject the proposal, which it said is ""unnecessary and potentially harmful to the company at this time.""McDonald's said it has robust corporate governance practices that provide shareholders with the ability to effectively voice their views with the board and vote on critical matters.The vote on the proposal comes shortly after activist hedge fund investors such as Jana Partners LLC and Corvex Management LP disclosed new stakes in McDonald's.Among other things, experts said activists are unlikely to benefit from the proposal because they tend to be short-term investors.

That would give longer-term shareholders with limited resources more power to hold directors accountable, Miller said. McDonald's encouraged shareholders to reject the proposal, which it said is ""unnecessary and potentially harmful to the company at this time.""McDonald's said it has robust corporate governance practices that provide shareholders with the ability to effectively voice their views with the board and vote on critical matters.The vote on the proposal comes shortly after activist hedge fund investors such as Jana Partners LLC and Corvex Management LP disclosed new stakes in McDonald's.Among other things, experts said activists are unlikely to benefit from the proposal because they tend to be short-term investors.

437,"  (Adds McDonald's comment)By Ross Kerber and Lisa BaertleinBOSTON/LOS ANGELES May 20 Four U.S. public pension fund officials on Wednesday warned that McDonald's Corp  and other companies may be jeopardizing their own futures by returning excessive amounts of cash to investors via share buybacks.The statement by the fund officials marks the first time in which some of the nation's biggest institutional investors have joined up to urge companies to rethink their focus on immediate returns and aim for long-term growth.The four officials - New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer, New York state Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli, Chicago Treasurer Kurt Summers and California Controller Betty Yee - are fiduciaries to pension funds with $860 billion in assets. Yee is on the boards of both the California Public Employees' Retirement System and the California State Teachers' Retirement System.The statement singled out McDonald's and comes a day ahead of the fast-food chain's annual shareholders meeting.It said McDonald's is continuing an ""aggressive"" share buyback program even as it begins an overhaul of its operations.The drive by the four officials runs counter to calls for more payouts from high-profile activist investors, including some that recently disclosed stakes in McDonald's, which could set up a clash over how the country's largest restaurant chain allocates capital.The pension leaders, in the statement, said that companies' productivity and wage growth had once matched and helped drive prosperity. ""Today, however, 95 percent of corporate earnings are being distributed to shareowners, prompting us to question whether companies are adequately reinvesting for sustainable returns over the long-term,"" they said. ""If the pendulum swings too far in favor of returning capital to shareowners, the future viability of the companies in which we invest may be placed at risk.""The statement referred to ""serious performance challenges"" at McDonald's.McDonald's Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook, who took over the top spot on March 1, earlier this month announced a turnaround strategy that included returning up to $9 billion to investors through dividends and share repurchases.""McDonald's is in turnaround mode and that is a business decision our leadership made in balance with other factors,"" company spokeswoman Heidi Barker Sa Shekhem said on Wednesday. Recent filings showed new shareholders in McDonald's include activist investors Jana Partners LLC and Corvex Management LP, which have pushed for share buybacks elsewhere.  Neither would comment about the restaurant chain.DON'T OVERDO IT McDonald's annual meeting on Thursday, at its headquarters in Oak Brook, Illinois, is to include a shareholder vote on a measure known as ""proxy access"" that would make it easier for small groups of shareholders to run director candidates. McDonald's board opposes proxy access and said it could open the door to what it called ""special-interest"" candidates.In their statement, the four pension fund officials said proxy access would help ""hold boards accountable when they place short-term interests ahead of long-term value creation.""Share buybacks have come under increasing scrutiny as academics and politicians criticize them as potentially short-sighted and argue that more profits should be used to shore up companies' long-term growth and improve wages for employees.Last year Laurence Fink, CEO of BlackRock Inc, the world's largest asset manager, warned companies against overdoing dividends and buybacks at the expense of future growth. In April, U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin, a Democrat of Wisconsin, asked securities regulators to review buyback rules.From 2003 to 2012 S&P 500 companies used 54 percent of their earnings to buy back stock, or $2.4 trillion, with dividends absorbing another 37 percent of earnings, according to a paper by University of Massachusetts Lowell Professor William Lazonick published in the Harvard Business Review late last year.""That left very little for investments in productive capabilities or higher incomes for employees,"" Lazonick wrote.On the other side of the debate, a generation of activist investors has had success pressing companies to step up buybacks and to increase dividends, both meant to boost returns amid a soft economic recovery.Under pressure from billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn, for example, Apple boosted its repurchase program in April to $140 billion from $90 billion last year. Icahn this week said he is again pressing to increase that amount.

443,"  * Visa says disappointment with FIFA is ""profound""* Consumers attack brands on Twitter* Nike says cooperating with authorities* Adidas, Coca-Cola Hyundai, McDonald's, Anheuser-Busch concerned* World Cup seen as too lucrative to ditch   (Adds comment, background)By Anjali Athavaley and Emma ThomassonNEW YORK/BERLIN, May 28 Visa Inc has told FIFA it could end its sponsorship if soccer's governing body does not act fast to restore the reputation of the game after senior officials were arrested on  corruption charges.The statement from Visa was the strongest so far as sponsors lined up to express concern about the scandal engulfing the world's most popular sport and their customers took to social media to threaten a boycott of brands associated with FIFA.Sponsors are trying to balance the growing sensitivity of consumers to corruption, human rights abuses and environmental issues against their relationship with the organisation that holds the keys to a billion soccer fans worldwide.""Our disappointment and concern with FIFA in light of today's developments is profound. As a sponsor, we expect FIFA to take swift and immediate steps to address these issues within its organization,"" Visa said.""This starts with rebuilding a culture with strong ethical practices,"" it said. ""Should FIFA fail to do so, we have informed them that we will reassess our sponsorship.""U.S. prosecutors issued an indictment on Wednesday accusing nine officials from soccer's world governing body and five sports media and promotions executives of bribes involving more than $150 million over 24 years.Airline Emirates and Japanese electronics maker Sony Corp announced in November they would not renew deals with FIFA, although rivals Qatar Airways and Samsung  are reportedly in talks to replace them.Emirates and Sony were among FIFA's six main partners who together paid a total of $177 million in 2014 for the right to advertise in World Cup stadiums and use the FIFA trademark.A source familiar with the Sony decision said suspected corruption was one factor behind Sony's withdrawal although the main reason was the high cost of the sponsorship deal.Sponsors have long faced risks to their brands from sports scandals ranging from doping to match fixing to misbehaviour of top players on and off the pitch. Sponsors including Nike Inc dropped American cyclist Lance Armstrong in 2012 after he was banned for doping, but Germany's Adidas decided last year to stick with Uruguay's Luis Suarez after FIFA banned him for nine matches for biting an Italy defender.""Brands have to take a longer-term view. Any sport is littered with controversy on and off the field,"" said Paul Smith, founder of sports marketing research group Repucom.""What fans care about most of all is the game itself rather than the business of the game... Being a sponsor of FIFA implies you are a sponsor of the game, not of the organisation.""CLOSE TIES FIFA's longest standing partners are Adidas and Coca-Cola Co .Adidas has been the provider of the World Cup match ball since 1970 and has a partnership lasting until 2030, while the current deal for Coca-Cola, which has had a formal association since 1974 and has advertised in every World Cup stadium since 1950, lasts until 2022.That perhaps explains why they stopped short of threatening to cut ties like Visa, the world's largest credit and debit card company, which only became a FIFA partner in 2007 and recently extended the relationship until 2022. ""This lengthy controversy has tarnished the mission and ideals of the FIFA World Cup and we have repeatedly expressed our concerns about these serious allegations,"" Coca Cola said.Adidas, which is the world's biggest manufacturer of soccer balls, boots and shirts, side stepped outright criticism, calling instead for FIFA ""to continue to establish and follow transparent compliance standards"". Its shares fell 1.5 percent on Thursday.Meanwhile, Nike, which is not a FIFA partner but is challenging Adidas' dominance in soccer by sponsoring many of the world's top players and teams, said it was cooperating with authorities after it was indirectly identified in the U.S. indictment in relation to a 1996 deal with the Brazil team.U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch declined to comment on whether there was any liability for companies that had won marketing rights and if they were being investigated. But she said ""the investigation is continuing and covers all aspects.""She declined to comment when asked if one of the companies was Nike.Nike later said in a statement it was ""concerned by the very serious allegations, adding: ""Nike believes in ethical and fair play in both business and sport and strongly opposes any form of manipulation or bribery."" OTHER SPONSORS BRISTLE FIFA's main sponsors were already getting uneasy even before the latest revelations.Adidas, Visa and Coca-Cola all made statements last week pushing FIFA to take seriously the issue of rights for migrant workers in Qatar, responding to reports of abuses at the 2022 World Cup construction sites.That came after campaigners designed spoof ads for major FIFA sponsors subverting their brand images, including a Coca-Cola can dripping with oil and the iconic three stripes of Adidas tweaked to look like a line of gravestones.The pressure only mounted after Wednesday's news, with social media full of appeals for brands to cut ties with FIFA.""Adidas, Visa, Coca-Cola, McDonald's, Budweiser, Hyundai: stop supporting corrupt FIFA or I stop buying your brands,"" wrote Stefan-Joerg Goebel on Twitter.The Institute of Directors (IoD), a leading UK authority on corporate governance, said risks were mounting for sponsors.""They have a responsibility to their shareholders to make certain that the company's cash is not going towards sporting events mired in bribery and corruption allegations,"" said Roger Barker, IoD director of corporate governance.South Korean automaker Hyundai Motor, the sole Asian FIFA partner for the 2018 World Cup due to be held in Russia, said it was ""extremely concerned"" about the legal proceedings, while Bud-owner Anheuser-Busch InBev and McDonald's Corp said they were in contact with FIFA.Australian sportswear company SKINS, which announced in a tongue-in-cheek campaign in January that it was the first ""official"" FIFA non-sponsor, urged the brands to clean up FIFA.""The only people FIFA will listen to are the sponsors. The real money is with the broadcasters but their brands aren't exposed in the same way as the sponsors,"" said SKINS chairman Jaimie Fuller.But brand experts were sceptical of a mass exodus of FIFA sponsors.""Football is one of the few global properties that enables you to connect with people around the world,"" said Interbrand Chief Executive Jez Frampton.Rob Prazmark, president of 21 Sports & Entertainment Marketing Group, a global sports and event sales agency agreed:""These sponsors put a lot of money into associating with the World Cup,"" he said. ""They'll give them a little bit of time to get their house in order.""

444,"  June 1 Foster Farms, one of the top U.S. chicken producers, plans to largely eliminate antibiotics used to treat humans from its poultry production, it said on Monday.The move brings California-based Foster Farms in line with other top chicken producers, including market leader Tyson Foods Inc, that are backing away from using the drugs over concerns about antibiotic-resistant bacteria.Privately held Foster Farms is working to end the use of all antibiotics used in human medicine, except in instances where the health of a poultry flock is at risk, and has stopped using antibiotics considered to be critical to human health, according to a statement. Independent auditors will ensure compliance with the company's plans, it said. It will continue to use animal-only antibiotics when needed for ""conventional"" flocks, or those not designated to be antibiotic-free, it said. There have not been any human health concerns raised over animal-only antibiotics. The debate over the agriculture industry's longstanding practice of using human antibiotics in livestock production has heated up in recent years. Public health experts and federal regulators have grown increasingly concerned that their use could create a health hazard by spurring the creation of antibiotic-resistant superbugs in humans. Tyson has said it plans to eliminate the use of human antibiotics in its chicken flocks by September 2017. Its move will help the company meet a deadline outlined by McDonald's Corp for its U.S. restaurants to gradually stop buying chicken raised with human antibiotics over the next two years.In 2013, Foster Farms was the 10th largest U.S. poultry producer. It produced 21 million pounds of ready to cook chicken a week, according to industry data.

U.S. consumer spending recorded its largest increase in nearly six years in May on strong demand for automobiles and other big-ticket items. EU antitrust regulators are probing Visa International's inter-regional card fees, after accusing MasterCard of levying excessive fees, earlier in July.E-commerce company Amazon.com Inc is expected to report second-quarter revenue marginally above estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine, helped by growth in Amazon Web Services and sales in North America. The company broke out financial details of the cloud computing unit, a $5 billion business, for the first time last quarter. The company is expected to continue to report a loss, as it invests in products and services that ranged from Hollywood-style television productions to drone delivery and streaming video-calls.Second-quarter sales of McDonald's Corp are expected to beat Wall Street estimates as the fast food chain's turnaround efforts gain traction. Steve Easterbrook, who took the helm in March, has been working to reorganize some business units, sell restaurants to franchisees and cut costs to turn the fast-food giant into a ""modern, progressive burger company"". Investors will look out for any updates to its turnaround plans and any forecast.Dow company 3M Co is expected to post second-quarter earnings of nearly $2 per share on $7.83 billion in revenue, amid a shaky global economy that is causing concern for multinational companies. The company, whose shares have fallen some 5 percent this year, last month struck its biggest-ever acquisition to boost its presence in worker protection gear.Mining and construction machinery maker Caterpillar Inc is scheduled to release second-quarter earnings. Hurt by downturns in the previously profitable mining sector, the company has made labor cuts in both U.S. and international factories. Last quarter, CEO Doug Oberhelman said the remaining 2015 quarters' sales and profit will be lower than the first quarter. Analysts look for mostly flat results as a potentially better construction industries outlook will likely be overshadowed by soft revenue in the company's resources industries.The U.S. Labor Department issues weekly unemployment data. The number of Americans filing new applications for unemployment benefits is expected to have slightly declined by 1000 to 280,000. (0830/1230)  In another report, the Conference Board is likely to show a 0.2 percent rise in its Leading Economic Index for June, after increasing 0.7 percent in May.  (1000/1400)AT&T Inc, the No.2 U.S. carrier, will report second-quarter earnings as its proposed $48.5 billion deal to buy DirecTV is expected to be approved by regulators. Investors will keep an eye out for any impact of heated telecom industry competition on margins and subscriber metrics in addition to details on conditions imposed by the FCC on the DirecTV merger.Eli Lilly and Co, helped by cost cuts and new treatments for cancer and diabetes, is expected to report second-quarter earnings growth despite the stronger dollar and generic competition for its Cymbalta depression drug. The drugmaker, which has vowed to return to profit growth in 2015 following three years of patent expirations on its biggest products, is expected to outline research progress for many of its experimental medicines. Also, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co is expected to report lower second-quarter earnings and sales, hurt by the end of a longstanding agreement under which it had sold blockbuster schizophrenia drug Abilify in partnership with Japanese drugmaker Otsuka Holdings Co. Investors will be far more intent on how Bristol's respected array of cancer immunotherapies are faring in clinical trials and whether its recently approved Opdivo is on track to meet sales expectations of $750 million this year, growing to $3.75 billion by 2017. Biotechnology company Celgene Corp pre-reported second-quarter results and provided updated 2015 and longer-range forecasts. However investors will be looking for fresh management comment on its recent spate of deals, including taking a $1 billion stake in Juno Therapeutics and a $7.2 billion acquisition of Receptos Inc. Canada's Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc reports second-quarter results. The acquisitive company has been linked to reports that have it buying Zoetis and CEO Mike Pearson's comments about M&A plans are usually the headline from Valeant conference calls.China will be a hot topic for General Motors Co executives when they report second-quarter results. Analysts are looking for profits of about $1.08 a share, up from 58 cents a share a year ago. Car sales in China have slowed sharply posing a challenge to the Detroit automaker which has counted on sustaining 9-10 percent profit margins in China to offset weak performance in other markets outside the  U.S. Barclay's this week cut its rating on GM to ""equal weight"" from ""overweight"" and predicted GM management would have to lower its mid-term targets for China. GM also has trimmed production in Europe. So far, Chief Executive Mary Barra has shown no sign that she intends to lower her profit targets, and she has booming U.S. demand for GM's pickup trucks and large sport utility vehicles to buoy overall results. Comcast Corp, the largest U.S. cable TV provider, will report second-quarter earnings as the pay-TV market continues to grapple with stagnation. Wall Street will be keeping a close watch on Comcast's video and broadband subscriber metrics.  Investors will also look out for details on whether the company's upcoming video streaming service ""Stream"" targeting its younger customers can make up for losses in the pay-TV growth and hold its own in the increasingly competitive online streaming service market.No. 1 U.S. railroad Union Pacific Corp will report second-quarter results. Analysts will be watching to see how Omaha, Nebraska-based Union Pacific managed its costs and its networks amid sharp drops in coal volumes during the quarter and whether it was able to continue raising prices.Starbucks Corp is expected to report strong third-quarter results as healthy sales trends and low costs for key ingredients such as milk offset the pressure from rising labor costs.Dow Chemical Co, which has been benefiting from low raw material costs for making plastics, is estimated to report a rise in second-quarter profit. The company has been ramping up its plastics operations, while shedding low margin businesses to increase its focus on performance plastics, electronics and agricultural science products. The company, which is growing investments mainly in the U.S. Gulf Coast and the Middle East, cut 3 percent of its global workforce in May as part of a broader plan to reduce costs by $1 billion over three years. Investors will look for details on additional cost-cutting measures.Second-quarter unit revenue is expected to decline for United Continental Holdings Inc and Southwest Airlines Co as the companies grow their capacity, and as United faces weak demand abroad from the strong U.S. dollar. Investors will listen for guidance the airlines give on whether they will lower their capacity growth plans in line with demand. U.S. regulators will be listening for the guidance too, as the Justice Department is investigating whether the carriers along with Delta Air Lines Inc and American Airlines Group Inc have worked together illegally to keep fares high by signaling supply cuts. Under Armour Inc, the No.2 U.S. footwear company, is expected to report second-quarter sales above analysts' estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine, helped by higher demand for Speed Form and Curry One shoes. Under Armour, which typically beats expectations, had a rough first quarter hurt by high expenses following a couple of acquisitions. The company had raised its full-year forecast, which was still shy of street expectations. Last week, Under Armour brought in Dallas Mavericks' CEO Terdema Ussery as a president in a bid to grow its NBA-related offerings that are popular among young Americans. Investors will be keen on any changes to full-year forecast and any sign ups.Boston Scientific Corp is expected to report a fall in second-quarter profit, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine, as the company continues to face litigation charges. These charges prompted the medical device maker to cut its full-year forecast last quarter. The company is in the middle of court battles for claims alleging injuries caused by its transvaginal mesh device.

475,"   By Simon Evans | ZURICH  ZURICH World Cup sponsor McDonald’s has joined Coca-Cola and Visa in urging FIFA to adopt an independent reform commission in response to the scandals that have plagued world soccer’s governing body.The campaign group New FIFA Now on Thursday published an email from a McDonald's saying the fast food giant supports the creation of an independent body to deal with FIFA’s problems.    “In regards to an independent reform commission, we do believe this is an important step in the greater reform that has to happen within FIFA,” McDonald’s vice-president of global media relations and issues management, Heidi Barker Sa Shekhem wrote in the email.      Previously, McDonald’s had been critical of FIFA and urged change without specifically calling for an independent reform process.     “An independent commission would bring an appropriate level of credibility, transparency, and neutrality to the role, and ultimately provide sponsors and fans across the globe with the confidence that the reform effort is both meaningful and a step in the right direction,” wrote Sa Shekhem.    World soccer's governing body has been in crisis since May, when nine officials and five marketing executives were charged by the U.S. Justice Department with exploiting the sport for their own gain through bribes of more than $150 million over 24 years.    In the wake of the scandal, FIFA President Sepp Blatter has said he will stand down next February.

476,"   By Simon Evans | ZURICH  ZURICH Aug 6 World Cup sponsor McDonald's  has joined Coca-Cola and Visa in urging FIFA to adopt an independent reform commission in response to the scandals that have plagued world football's governing body.The campaign group New FIFA Now on Thursday published an email from a McDonald's saying the fast food giant supports the creation of an independent body to deal with FIFA's problems.""In regards to an independent reform commission, we do believe this is an important step in the greater reform that has to happen within FIFA,"" McDonald's vice-president of global media relations and issues management, Heidi Barker Sa Shekhem wrote in the email.Previously, McDonald's had been critical of FIFA and urged change without specifically calling for an independent reform process. ""An independent commission would bring an appropriate level of credibility, transparency, and neutrality to the role, and ultimately provide sponsors and fans across the globe with the confidence that the reform effort is both meaningful and a step in the right direction,"" wrote Sa Shekhem.World soccer's governing body has been in crisis since May, when nine officials and five marketing executives were charged by the U.S. Justice Department with exploiting the sport for their own gain through bribes of more than $150 million over 24 years.

The category is increasingly competitive as growth-hungry chains dive in or double down with new breakfast menu items.

481,"  (Corrects dateline from Aug 17. No changes to text)By Anthony BoadleBRASILIA Aug 20 McDonald's Corp, the world's biggest fast-food chain, was accused of mistreating its employees and dodging taxes on Thursday during a Senate hearing in Brazil, where politicians, union leaders and workers from five continents voiced allegations.McDonald's has come under increasing scrutiny worldwide for allegations of labor abuses, health and safety violations, plus tax evasion in Europe, and Brazilian Senator Pablo Paim called a hearing to allow both sides to make their cases.McDonald's deferred comment to its regional operator.Arcos Dorados Holdings Inc, the world's largest McDonald's franchisee and its main operator in Latin America, where it employs 95,000 people and had sales of $3.7 billion last year, was invited to attend the hearing but chose not to, a company spokesman said.""We are absolutely convinced that the company has complied with labor laws ever since it opened its first restaurant in Brazil 36 years ago,"" Arcos Dorados said in a statement. It said the company was proud to be the top first-job employer for young Brazilians. Union representatives told the hearing that McDonald's franchisees in Brazil have denied workers' pay for extra time worked, not allowed them to join unions and employed teenagers in their kitchens without protective gear, causing some to suffer burns from frying grease and grills.""Instead of feeding society with good jobs and paying its fair share of taxes, McDonald's feeds on communities, forcing people into dead-end jobs and avoiding taxes,"" Scott Courtney of the U.S.-based Service Employees International Union said.The 1.9 million-member SEIU, which has backed the ""Fight for $15"" (hourly wage) campaign in the American fast food industry since a New York walkout in 2012, said the hearing was a chance to draw wider attention to McDonald's labor policies. ""McDonald's is a global player, and people all over the world should know it is an unfair player that should face global pressure to pay its taxes and decent wages,"" said Jutta Steinruck, a member of the European Parliament.She said McDonald's is being investigated in Europe for allegedly evading payment of 1 billion euros in taxes.One of Brazil's largest labor federations, the UGT, filed a complaint last Friday, asking prosecutors to investigate allegations of tax evasion, unfair competition and violation of franchise laws by Arcos Dorados. The company said it had not been informed of the complaint and said it was confident that it was ""rigorously"" following Brazilian laws.Previous legal complaints in Brazil have not affected the company and regulatory labor authorities have not taken action either.Witnesses at the hearing called on Brazil's Congress to open an investigation into the labor practices of the fast food industry in Brazil, but that will require the signature of 80 lawmakers and concrete evidence of abuses, said Congressman Antonio Carlos Mendes Thame, who attended the hearing.The call for an inquiry was backed by 19-year-old Lucas da Cruz Marques, who worked for 18 months at a McDonald's at a Sao Paulo metro station until he was fired last month after joining a union to press for better working conditions.""I thought it was a good career opportunity to go and work for a multinational company,"" he said.

489,"   By Nathan Layne and Mica Rosenberg  U.S. union leaders said on Friday that a landmark U.S. labor board ruling on companies' obligations toward contract and franchise workers would help them organize manufacturers and e-commerce companies as well as fast food chains.On Thursday the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) ruled the owner of a California recycling plant was a ""joint employer"" with the contractor that hired workers at the plant, essentially forcing both to bargain with the union together or risk violating U.S. labor law.Business groups, arguing that the ruling could lead to higher costs and hurt the economy, are pushing the Republican-led Congress to overturn it, in part it because the company named in the decision - Browning-Ferris - cannot challenge it in a federal court without overcoming a number of procedural hurdles.Unions see the decision as a breakthrough not just in efforts to help employees organizes at franchisees of McDonald's Corp and other chains but also as a tool to counter the proliferation of subcontracting in other industries in which workers are one or two steps removed from the companies indirectly controlling them.Manufacturers including auto workers, food processors, steelmakers and aerospace companies are potential targets for union campaigns, said Elizabeth Bunn, director of the AFL-CIO's organizing department, noting that plant workers are often not directly employed by the parent firm.""You literally can walk into almost any non-union manufacturing plant in the United States and you'll see workers working on a line and not be able to distinguish who is temp from an agency and who is a direct employee of the company,"" she said.Big labor has focused much of its resources over the past few years on pushing for higher wages in the fast-food industry, and the Browning-Ferris ruling could have implications for an ongoing NLRB case seeking to hold McDonald accountable as a ""joint employer"" for alleged violations at franchisees.'GAME-CHANGER' But union organizers see Thursday's ruling as paving the way for gains across a range of industries given the widespread use of subcontracting by the manufacturing and service sectors to lower costs. ""It's certainly a game changer,"" said Teague Paterson, a partner at Beeson Tayer & Bodine, a law firm representing the union in the NLRB case.

511,"   By Mica Rosenberg and Simon Evans | NEW YORK/ZURICH  NEW YORK/ZURICH Major soccer sponsors on Friday issued coordinated calls for the immediate resignation of FIFA president Sepp Blatter in the most significant move by companies supporting the sport since a bribery and corruption scandal erupted at world football's governing body last May.Coca-Cola Co, McDonald's, Visa, and Budweiser owner Anheuser-Busch InBev, companies that have long linked their brand names to soccer, on Friday demanded Blatter step down immediately in a strong push for change at the organization. Blatter earlier announced he would resign in February next year.The sponsor statements, all using similar language, came just a week after Swiss authorities said they were opening a criminal investigation into Blatter, the 79-year-old Swiss national who has lead FIFA for the past 17 years.AB InBev said it has been ""actively engaged"" in the FIFA reform process as part of a group of sponsors.""Every day that passes, the image and reputation of FIFA continues to tarnish,"" Coca Cola said. ""FIFA needs comprehensive and urgent reform, and that can only be accomplished through a truly independent approach.""Visa and McDonald's joined the call for Blatter to step aside. ""The events of recent weeks have continued to diminish the reputation of FIFA and public confidence in its leadership,"" McDonald's said in an emailed statement.Blatter responded by saying he would not resign, setting the stage for a battle over who should take the helm in the next few months before February when elections are set for a new FIFA president.In a statement from his U.S. lawyer Richard Cullen, Blatter said he believed leaving office would not be in FIFA's best interest or advance the needed reforms of the organization. Scandals surrounding global soccer exploded in May, when 14 soccer officials and sports marketing executives were indicted on U.S. charges of racketeering, money laundering and wire fraud in relation to bribery schemes that dated back decades.Last Friday, the Swiss Office of the Attorney General said it opened a criminal investigation into Blatter on suspicion of criminal mismanagement and misappropriation of funds.It was the first time that authorities investigating corruption in the world's most popular sport had pointed the finger directly at Blatter. He has denied wrongdoing and his U.S. attorney said he was cooperating with the Swiss probe.FIFA's awarding of the 2018 and 2022 competitions to Russia and Qatar is one of the strands under scrutiny from U.S. and Swiss authorities investigating corruption in the organization, a worry for tournament sponsors including McDonald's, Coca-Cola and Visa.""One of the things consumers are looking for in brands today is for them to be responsible,"" said Trevor Wade from the brand consultancy firm Landor. She said the moves by the sponsors was a way to take a public stand about something they think matters to customers.It is an unprecedented decision by companies that have largely stood back as developments in the case unfolded in recent months, said Jaimie Fuller a co-founder of campaign group #NewFifaNow.""The drastic nature of this call stresses the extreme problems faced by FIFA,"" Fuller said, ""and should show everybody how the sports governing body is teetering on the abyss.""

Since then, the company's shares have climbed 5.9 percent while the broad S&P 500 .SPX index fell 3.9 percent.Optimistic buyers have priced the shares for growth that has yet to materialize, and against broad concerns that increased burger competition and healthy dining preferences will continue to suppress the chain's sales.Analysts are predicting a fairly steep 8.2 percent decline in total third quarter sales. The Thursday report is likely to produce greater than normal trading volatility in the shares, based on recent options activity.UPHILL EARNINGS  Despite the projected revenue decline, the consensus forecast for the third quarter is for a 17 percent jump in earnings per share, to $1.27. Like other companies in the S&P 500, McDonald's has managed to improve its earnings per share by buying back its own shares and cutting costs.Some of the stock's momentum may already have slipped away, as investors discounted earnings and took greater note of McDonald's underlying sales weakness. The number of U.S. funds holding McDonald's has fallen about 15 percent this year according to Lipper data.Analysts have put a median target price of $104 on the stock, pointing to a top in the share price that closed at a record of $104.82 on Friday.One investor who got off the boat is Christopher Rowane, a portfolio manager at Bahl & Gaynor Investment Counsel in Cincinnati. He said his fund held a ""significant positioning"" in McDonald's and largely reduced it midway through this year.  ""Millenials can drive some of that traffic the most, and they are looking for fresh, natural, organic"" food, he said. ""That's fairly distant from the McDonald’s menu.""Weak sales against an 11 percent rise in McDonald's shares this year have made the company unusually expensive. At just over 20, its forward price earnings ratio is at its highest since early 2001, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S data.The company has made several changes - from adding an all day breakfast menu to pledging to phase out chickens fed on certain antibiotics. Some, including Credit Suisse, are expecting those efforts to help. This week the bank added McDonald's to its Global Focus List, and reiterated an outperform rating with a $112 price target. The bank said late last month U.S. same restaurant sales were starting to recover partly due to menu changes.McDonald's shares also may have benefited from speculation that the company is near a decision to spin off its real estate holdings into an investment trust, or REIT.""It would unlock some value but I think they would rather grow the business by improving traffic,"" said Gary Bradshaw, a portfolio manager with Hodges Funds in Dallas who holds the stock in separate managed accounts for its sizeable 3.3 percent dividend, but sold it out of its funds last year due to declining earnings.Adding to concerns, a technical look at the stock's chart is throwing a big red flag.

522,"   By Lisa Baertlein and Yashaswini Swamynathan  McDonald's Corp (MCD.N) shares hit an all-time high on Thursday after Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook said a rebound in quarterly restaurant sales showed that his turnaround plan is starting to work.Global sales at established restaurants were up a much better-than-expected 4 percent in the third quarter, ending six straight quarters of flat or falling results. And, Easterbrook said, the trend would continue in the current quarter.Shares of the world's biggest restaurant chain by sales jumped more than 8 percent to a record $110.88 in early trading  as a renewed focus on value and service helped business around the world.""The progress we have made in a short amount of time gives me confidence we're making the right moves to turn around our business and reposition McDonald's as a modern, progressive burger company,"" Easterbrook said on a conference call with analysts and investors.The United States, McDonald's No. 1 market for profit, reported a surprise 0.9 percent increase in sales at restaurants open at least 13 months. McDonald's said a new Premium Buttermilk Crispy Chicken Deluxe sandwich and its decision to swap butter for margarine on its Egg McMuffins helped the division break a two-year streak of quarterly sales declines. China's same-restaurant sales, which had plummeted after a food safety scandal in July 2014, were up a whopping 26.8 percent for the quarter, helped by a focus on value and breakfast.  Australia, the United Kingdom and Canada also contributed to the quarterly rise in sales at restaurants open at least 13 months, after McDonald's tweaked menus, improved service and refined its offering of inexpensive food.Easterbrook, now eight months into his tenure as CEO, has announced plans to speed up service, simplify menus and boost food quality.In the United States, he rolled out all-day breakfast, began switching to chicken from birds raised without important antibiotics and raised wages for workers in restaurants run by the corporation.On Thursday, Easterbrook said winning back customers remains a top priority in the United States, where competition is fierce and speed is key.  All-day breakfast, launched Oct. 6, is part of that effort. While that move appears to have boosted traffic, some domestic franchisees complain that all-day breakfast and the company's plans to customize sandwiches is complicating operations and slowing service.Easterbrook said restaurant operators have embraced all-day breakfast, and that an early read suggests it is ""an incremental profitable business"" wooing new and existing customers. On the other hand, McDonald's said its decision to raise wages and improve benefits for 90,000 workers in U.S. company-operated restaurants took a bite out of operating income.  Third-quarter net income was up 23 percent to $1.31 billion, or $1.40 per share. Revenue fell 5 percent to $6.62 billion. Chief Financial Officer Kevin Ozan said the strong U.S. dollar would ding fourth-quarter earnings per share by 8 to 10 cents. McDonald's gets about one-third of revenue and more than half of its operating income from outside the United States.At midday, McDonald's shares were up 7.5 percent to $110.20.

530,"  (Adds McDonald's adopting proxy access)BOSTON Oct 26 JPMorgan Chase & Co said on Monday its board will consider a bylaw amendment to make it easier for small groups of investors to run candidates for the New York bank's board of directors.That move came just hours before fast-food leader McDonald's Corp announced that its board amended company bylaws to provide shareholders with new rights of proxy access for director nominations. In a securities filing, JPMorgan said its board told management to prepare an amendment to grant groups of up to 20 shareholders the right to nominate their own candidates, a change known as ""proxy access"" that has become a popular reform at many companies this year. JPMorgan said the amendment would include a requirement that shareholders would need to have owned at least 3 percent of the company for three years, a common threshold and an approach the board requested. In addition, JPMorgan said its board has adopted a policy under which it would disclose whether it has recouped any incentive compensation from senior executives.

542,"   By Davide Scigliuzzo  NEW YORK, Nov 10 (IFR) - S&P downgraded the credit rating of McDonald's one notch on Tuesday after the burger giant said it would increase debt to return US$10bn of cash to shareholders by the end of next year.The agency lowered its rating to BBB+ from A- following the announcement and said it expects debt-to-Ebitda to increase to low to mid-3x in 2016-17, up from mid-2x currently. S&P noted the ""significant and rapid shift in financial policy"" by McDonald's, which also announced plans to increase its fourth-quarter dividend by 5%. ""We think results will benefit from cost reductions, but we believe McDonald's will continue to keep a high priority on allocating capital to shareholders, even as they execute on new strategies to improve operations in key markets,"" it said. The reaction across the McDonald's bond curve was mixed.The 3.375% May 2025s widened 9bp to a spread of 139bp, while other notes including the longer dated 4.6% May 2045s tightened between 5bp and 7bp, according to MarketAxess data.

543,"   By Lisa Baertlein  Nov 10 McDonald's Corp is expected to announce early results from its domestic all-day breakfast push, give a verdict on whether it will spin off its U.S. real estate and announce a dividend increase at its investor meeting on Tuesday.Shares in the world's biggest restaurant chain have been trading at record highs since Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook said on Oct. 22 that a rebound in quarterly sales at established restaurants showed his turnaround plan was beginning to take hold.McDonald's launched all-day breakfast on Oct. 6 in the United States, its top profit market.The move, hailed by so-called ""breakfastarians,"" has irked some restaurant operators. They complained in a survey that all-day breakfast has complicated kitchen operations, slowed service and prompted diners to choose less-expensive breakfast items over higher-priced lunch and dinner options. Still, the median estimate from 29 U.S. franchisees polled by Nomura analyst Mark Kalinowski predicted that all-day breakfast would boost this quarter's domestic same-restaurant sales by 1.5 percent.Analysts anticipated that the recent sales improvement should ease pressure on McDonald's to put its U.S. properties into a real estate investment trust (REIT). That move has been promoted by activist investor Larry Robbins, CEO of Glenview Capital Management, who believes it could unlock more than $20 billion in value.Real estate historically has been an important part of McDonald's business. The company collects rents from franchisees and those payments have increased 26 percent from 2009 to 2014. Last year, when company sales and profits dropped, rents accounted for more than 22 percent of McDonald's total revenue. The ""rent and royalty income we receive from franchisees provides a stable revenue stream that has relatively low costs and enables us to return significant cash to shareholders,"" McDonald's said in its 2014 annual report.Some experts say McDonald's stellar credit rating could result in real estate returns that are too low to be attractive. And, the Internal Revenue Service recently signaled that REITs and other corporate spinoffs may violate rules aimed at preventing companies from avoiding taxes.""It's difficult to see McDonald's wanting to meaningfully change this successful long-term approach. That said, never say never!"" said Kalinowski, who expects the chain to raise its quarterly dividend to 89 cents per share from 85 cents.Shares in the chain, whose New York City investor meeting was targeted by workers protesting for higher wages, were roughly flat at $113.14 in morning trading.

544,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, November 12 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the Issuer Default  Ratings (IDRs) of McDonald's Corporation (NYSE: MCD) at 'BBB+/F2'.  The Rating  Outlook has been revised to Negative from Stable. At Sept. 30, 2015, McDonald's  had approximately $18 billion of total debt. A full list of ratings is provided at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS Aggressive Financial Strategy The Negative Outlook reflects McDonald's aggressive financial strategy during a  period of challenged operating performance as the sustainability of recent  same-store sales (SSS) performance remains uncertain.  McDonald's cash flow priorities have consistently been to invest in its business  and return all remaining cash flow to shareholders. However, management is  demonstrating a growing willingness to utilize its balance sheet to increase  shareholder returns. Fitch views this as a change in financial strategy and  projects that total adjusted debt/EBITDAR will approximate the mid-3x range in  2016, up from 3.1x at Sept. 30, 2015 and 2.6x at Dec. 31, 2014.  Absent sustained improvement in SSS and meaningful progress with refranchising  and cost savings, total adjusted debt/EBITDAR could be sustained at or exceed  the mid-3.0x range beyond 2016, resulting in a downgrade in ratings.   Maintaining the current level of share buybacks beyond 2016 could also  contribute to a negative rating action.    McDonald's intends to return about $30 billion of cash to shareholders via  dividends and share repurchases during the three-year period ending 2016, with  $7 billion returned through the third quarter of 2015. The plan is $10 billion  higher than the company's previously articulated target with the vast majority  financed with additional debt. McDonald's already issued $4.2 billion earlier  this year to help accelerate share buybacks in 2015. Fitch assumes McDonald's  could issue an incremental $8 billion of debt within the next 12 months to meet  its new target.  Fitch currently assumes that McDonald's comps will stay in the low-single-digit  territory in 2016 and 2017 and EBITDA remains fairly stable to 2015 projected  levels of $9.1 billion.  Fitch's longer-term forecast incorporates a cumulative  $2 billion of cash proceeds from the sale of company units, gradual realization  of $500 million of G&A expense savings, and that refranchising has only a modest  negative impact on operating income.  Sustainability of Recent SSS Performance Is Uncertain During the quarter ended Sept. 30, 2015, global SSS increased 4.0% with all  segments contributing. Comparable sales increased 0.9% in the U.S., 4.6% across  International Lead markets, 8.9% in High Growth markets, and 6.1% in  Foundational markets.  However, McDonald's is in the early stages of its turnaround plan.  The brand  continues to lose market share, particularly in the U.S. where McDonald's  reported a 3.2% comp gap to the quick-service sandwich category during the  September quarter. Global comparable guest counts are down 3.1% and 3.7% for the  nine- months ended September 2015 and September 2014, respectively.  Fitch views a cohesive and aggressive system-wide effort to improve service,  emphasize food quality and provide locally-relevant menu variety as necessary  catalysts for sustained SSS growth.  New Refranchising Target McDonald's intends to increase the percentage of its global system that is  franchised to 93% by the end of 2018 from 81% currently by selling 4,000 units  to operators. Longer term McDonald's strives to become 95% franchised.  Refranchising will mainly occur in McDonald's High Growth and Foundational  market segments which are currently 44% and 90% franchised, respectively. High  Growth markets include China, Italy, Poland, Russia, South Korea, Spain,  Switzerland, and the Netherlands. Foundational markets include various countries  outside of the U.S. and International Lead markets (Australia, Canada, France,  Germany, and the U.K.).   Fitch views McDonald's decision to reduce the number of company-operated  restaurants as consistent with industry trends. Franchising increases the  stability and quality of cash flows, given that it produces a steady stream of  royalty and rental income and has low capital requirements. Fitch anticipates  that capital expenditures will decline meaningfully from approximately $2  billion expected for both 2015 and 2016, if the company successfully meets its  goal.  Increased Cost Reductions   McDonald's also raised its annualized year-end 2017 G&A cost reduction target to  $500 million from $300 million. The goal represents nearly 20% of McDonald's  $2.6 billion expense base at the beginning of 2015. Savings will be realized  through refranchising, lower corporate overhead, and greater efficiencies across  global business services.  McDonald's expects to realize $150 million of savings by the end of 2016.  Fitch  anticipates savings to accelerate with the pace of refranchising and, along with  incremental royalty and rental-based income, to help offset operating income  declines associated with the sale of company-operated restaurants.  KEY ASSUMPTIONS --Positive low-single-digit SSS growth of about 2% in 2016 and beyond; --Operating income grows 5%-7% in 2016 and declines slightly thereafter due to  refranchising; --Total debt increases to, and is sustained at, about $26 billion;       --Free cash flow (FCF) approximates $1.5 billion in 2016; --Total adjusted debt-to-operating EBITDAR (defined as total debt plus 8x gross  rents-to-operating EBITDA plus gross rents) in the mid-3.0x range in 2016.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a negative  rating action include:  --Weak SSS performance in 2016 and continued market share losses; --The lack of meaningful progress with refranchising and realization of cost  savings;  --Total adjusted debt-to-operating EBITDAR sustained in the mid-3.0x range due  to weaker than expected operating results and share buybacks staying elevated in  2017.   Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a Stable  Outlook include:  --Several quarters of sustained positive low-single-digit SSS growth and  stabilization of market share; --Meaningful progress with refranchising and realization of cost savings; --Total adjusted debt-to-operating EBITDAR sustained in the low-3.0x range. LIQUIDITY McDonald's liquidity is supported by its large cash balance, FCF (cash from  operations less capex and dividends), and an undrawn revolving credit facility  that expires December 2019. At Sept. 30, 2015, McDonald's had $5 billion of  liquidity consisting of $2.5 billion of cash and $2.5 billion revolver  availability.  FCF typically exceeds $1 billion annually and was $1.5 billion  for the nine months ended September 30.  Upcoming debt maturities include approximately $800 million in 2016 and about $1  billion in 2017. Fitch expects near-term debt maturities to be refinanced given  McDonald's shareholder-friendly activities. Fitch affirmed the ratings for McDonald's as follows:  --Long-term IDR at 'BBB+'; --Bank credit facilities at 'BBB+'; --Senior unsecured debt at 'BBB+'; --Short-term IDR at 'F2'; --Commercial paper at 'F2'.

545,"   By Daniel Wiessner  A U.S. judge has ordered 10 McDonald's franchisees in New York City to comply with subpoenas from the National Labor Relations Board seeking information on their relationship with McDonald's Corp, as the agency tries to prove that the fast food giant is a joint employer of franchise workers.

555,"   By Foo Yun Chee | BRUSSELS  BRUSSELS EU antitrust regulators are likely to launch a formal investigation into McDonald's tax deal with Luxembourg, two people with knowledge of the matter said on Wednesday, widening the bloc's crackdown on corporate tax avoidance.European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager could announce the investigation as early as Thursday, the sources said, following on the heels of other recent cases, including deals between Luxembourg and carmaker Fiat and online retailer Amazon.com. Labor unions and the charity War on Want, have accused McDonald's of avoiding around 1 billion euros ($1 billion) in tax between 2009 and 2013 by routing revenue through a Luxembourg unit and have called for EU regulators to take action against the U.S. fast-food chain.McDonald's, in a statement, said it had not been told of any EU investigation and that it complies with all tax laws and rules in Europe. ""From 2010-2014, the McDonald's companies paid more than $2.1 billion just in corporate taxes in the European Union, with an average tax rate of almost 27 percent,"" the company said. ""Additionally, we pay social, real estate and other taxes.

556,"  (Adds McDonald's comment, details)By Foo Yun CheeBRUSSELS Dec 2 EU antitrust regulators are likely to launch a formal investigation into McDonald's  tax deal with Luxembourg, two people with knowledge of the matter said on Wednesday, widening the bloc's crackdown on corporate tax avoidance.European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager could announce the investigation as early as Thursday, the sources said, following on the heels of other recent cases, including deals between Luxembourg and carmaker Fiat and online retailer Amazon.com.Labour unions and the charity War on Want, have accused McDonald's of avoiding around 1 billion euros ($1 bln) in tax between 2009 and 2013 by routing revenue through a Luxembourg unit and have called for EU regulators to take action against the U.S. fast-food chain.McDonald's, in a statement, said it had not been told of any EU investigation and that it complies with all tax laws and rules in Europe. ""From 2010-2014, the McDonald's companies paid more than $2.1 billion just in corporate taxes in the European Union, with an average tax rate of almost 27 percent,"" the company said.""Additionally, we pay social, real estate and other taxes.

557,"   By Foo Yun Chee | BRUSSELS  BRUSSELS EU regulators are to investigate tax deals between McDonald's (MCD.N) and Luxembourg which enabled the U.S. chain to escape paying taxes on European franchise royalties from 2009, a move which could lead to hefty back taxes for the company.Confirming what sources with knowledge of the matter previously told Reuters, the bloc's antitrust regulators said on Thursday they would launch the probe into arrangements which could be defined as illegal state aid.The investigation comes two months after the European Commission ordered Luxembourg to recover up to 30 million euros ($32 million) from Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCHA.MI), and the Dutch to do the same for Starbucks (SBUX.O), because of tax deals seen as unlawful aid.The EU competition enforcer said McDonald's had not paid any corporate taxes in Luxembourg or the United States on royalties paid by franchisees in Europe and Russia since 2009, as a result of two tax rulings by the Luxembourg authorities.""We decided to open an investigation into two Luxembourg tax rulings to McDonald's because we have the concern that those two rulings have resulted in ... double non-taxation, and that may be state aid,"" Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager told Reuters.  ""This is not a question of the Luxembourg tax regime or their rules, this is a question of how rules are actually applied,"" Vestager said.Luxembourg's finance ministry said the country had granted no special tax treatment or selective advantage to McDonald's and would cooperate fully with the investigation. McDonald's said it complied with all tax rules in Europe and that its companies had paid more than 2.1 billion euros in corporate taxes in the EU from 2010 to 2014, with an average tax rate of almost 27 percent.FOOTING THE BILL   It also paid social, real estate and other taxes, while its independent franchises, operators of about 75 percent of its outlets, paid corporate and other taxes. ""We are confident that the inquiry will be resolved favorably,"" it said.In the United States, senior Treasury official Robert Stack told a Senate committee on Tuesday that the EU seemed to be singling out U.S. companies.""U.S. taxpayers would wind up footing the bill for these state aid settlements when the affected U.S. taxpayers either repatriate amounts voluntarily or Congress requires a deemed repatriation as part of tax reform,"" Stack said.The Commission said McDonald's Europe Franchising was exempted from paying taxes on this income in Luxembourg on the grounds that profits were subject to tax in the United States. But this was not the case when the ruling was granted in 2009.  In a second ruling, Luxembourg had agreed McDonald's did not have to prove this income was subject to U.S. tax, the Commission said, adding Luxembourg had exempted the profits from tax despite knowing they were not subject to tax in the United States.The case presents yet another headache for Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, as Luxembourg developed its favorable tax system during the near quarter-century that he served as the Grand Duchy's finance minister or prime minister.Junker has said he was not involved in any tax deals with individual companies but has also said he would take political responsibility for what happened in Luxembourg during his mandate. He has also said Vestager has the freedom to pursue any investigations she wished.

559,"   By Hillary Flynn  NEW YORK, Dec 4 (IFR) - A conservative bookbuild worked well for McDonald's this week, as it drew almost US$40bn of orders for a US$6bn five-tranche bond despite worries about leverage under a new turnaround plan.The burger giant was careful to hold an investor call before coming to market, aware that a recent downgrade to Baa1/BBB+ by Moody's and S&P was also on the minds of market participants.The borrower began building its order books with initial price thoughts that implied generous new issue concessions of around 40bp.A rush of orders followed, enabling McDonald's to pull levels 25bp-35bp inside IPTs on all five tranches, leaving the issuer paying final new issue concessions of 7bp-12bp.Final books were US$38.7bn, with orders of between US$8.6bn-$9.8bn on each of the 5, 10 and 30-year tranches.That was a good result for McDonald's, whose ambitious turnaround plan is starting to take hold - and especially as it sacrificed ratings to return money to shareholders.On November 10, the company said it planned to issue debt to finance an additional US$10bn cash payment to shareholders by the end of 2016 - a decision that triggered the downgrades. ""There had been some negative headlines around MCD, and that is one of the reasons I think they started so wide,"" said a banker away from the deal. ""They were extremely conservative.""In an effort to keep concessions at a reasonable level, the banker said, McDonald's kept the size of the bond at US$6bn - even though there was scope for a much larger deal.""They didn't want to pay up too much,"" the banker told IFR. ""To do US$10bn, they would have had to come with a larger concession."" COMFORTABLE Part of the reason for the strong demand, another banker said, is that investors had become more comfortable with the company's turnaround strategy.McDonald's recently said it will not spin off its properties into a real estate investment trust, easing investor concerns that it might mimic Yum Brands, a banker said, in taking drastic action to please shareholders.Rival fast food giant Yum, which has KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut under its umbrella, announced a spin-off of its fast-growing Chinese business. Yum's move sparked a downgrade to junk as well as a sharp widening in its bond spreads.Another banker said leveraging up to please shareholders was less of a worry than other risks.McDonald's ended up pricing a US$750m three-year at Treasuries plus 90bp; a US$1bn five-year at Treasuries plus 115bp; a US$1.75bn 10-year at Treasuries plus 155bp; a US$750m 20-year at Treasuries plus 180bp and a US$1.75bn 30-year at Treasuries plus 195bp.Those levels translated to coupons of 3.7% on the 10-year and 4.875% on the 30-year. The bonds tightened by 5bp to 8bp in secondary. It still offered value to investors, because the final pricing came on top of a recent spread widening.The McDonald's 3.375% May 2025s, issued earlier this year, were trading at a G-spread of 140bp-145bp before the new deal was priced - some 25bp-35bp wider than the Treasuries plus 115bp launch.""One of the reasons people want to buy bonds that finance M&A is because they are buying after spreads have widened, near the peak,"" a senior banker said. ""It was a similar case for McDonald's.""Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley were bookrunners on the trade.

563,"   By Foo Yun Chee  BRUSSELS - Three Italian consumer organizations have urged EU antitrust regulators to investigate McDonald's (MCD.N) franchise system in Europe, a month after the opening of an EU inquiry into the U.S. fast food company's tax deals with Luxembourg.Codacons, Movimento Difesa del Cittadino and Cittadinanzattiva filed their complaint with the European Commission on Monday, urging the EU competition enforcer to step in and look at a system, which they alleged was anti-competitive.""The system construed by McDonald's raises strong concerns under antitrust laws,"" the group said in its 46-page complaint seen by Reuters. Franchising is a key business model for the world's largest fast food chain. The company made $9.27 billion in revenues from its franchised restaurants worldwide last year, accounting for about a third of overall turnover. Franchisees operate about 75 percent of McDonald's outlets in Europe. At issue are 20-year contracts which are twice as long as most other franchises, a requirement that licensees lease premises from McDonald's at above-market rates and conditions hindering them from switching to competitors, the group says.""McDonald's exercises an excessive and disproportionate control on its franchisees by implementing conditions that exceed without justification what is required for the protection of its system, its know-how and reputation,"" the group said.  It said the restrictions hinder competition and lead to  consumers paying higher prices in franchised restaurants. It cited a survey which showed 97 percent of menu items cost more in franchises than in company-operated outlets in Bologna, while in Rome the figure was 68 percent and in Paris 71 percent.McDonald's dismissed the criticism.""We are proud of our franchisees and are committed to working closely together so that they have the support they need to operate their restaurants and their businesses,"" spokeswoman Joanna de Koning said in an email. ""This approach, with the principle of sharing risk and reward, has been successful for many years and has helped create the best business opportunities for our franchisees and the best overall experience for our customers.""Commission spokeswoman Lucia Caudet said: ""The Commission can confirm it has received the complaint, which it will now look into.""    The Italian consumer groups are backed by the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) and European trade unions, whose complaint about suspected tax avoidance by McDonald's prompted the European Commission to open an investigation into its tax arrangements with Luxembourg in December. The Commission is investigating the tax arrangements of multinational companies across the EU.""McDonald's abuse of its dominant market position hurts everyone: franchisees, consumers, and workers. We strongly urge the European Commission to investigate the charges and to use all of its powers to hold McDonald's accountable,"" SEIU organizing director Scott Courtney said. It is far from certain that the Commission will open a second investigation into the company.

566,"   By Maria Kiselyova and Olga Sichkar | MOSCOW  MOSCOW McDonald's (MCD.N) plans to increase investment in Russia and open more restaurants this year after a focus on local suppliers and affordable menus helped it to weather an economic crisis.Russia's economy, hit by weak oil prices and sanctions over Moscow's role in the Ukraine crisis, contracted by 3.7 percent in 2015. Economic indicators suggest the slump is far from over and consumers, facing high inflation, may cut spending further.""The eating-out industry has been stagnating since the beginning of 2015 but we have seen significant growth of our market share as we continued expansion,"" said Khamzat Khasbulatov, chief executive of McDonald's Russia.The U.S. fast-food chain also picked up customers from other casual dining rivals as it deferred price increases when a slump in the rouble and Moscow's ban on many Western foodstuff inflated the cost of supplies, he said.In 2016, it plans to open more than 60 restaurants, compared with 59 in 2015. The cost of investments in new openings and refurbishment of older restaurants will rise to about 9 billion rubles ($113 million) from 8 billion in 2015. Khasbulatov also said the company had fully recovered from an unprecedented series of regulatory checks in 2014 when it had to temporarily shut many of its restaurants. The closures were viewed broadly as a retaliation by Moscow for Western sanctions.The company had planned to spend 6 billion rubles in 2015 but exceeded that figure as it opened more restaurants than planned, although its profitability declined.  It did not give specific profit figures. ""You cannot immediately offset a hike in (supplier) prices with an increase in menu prices, it's a long process.

The U.S. fast-food chain also picked up customers from other casual dining rivals as it deferred price increases when a slump in the rouble and Moscow's ban on many Western foodstuff inflated the cost of supplies, he said.In 2016, it plans to open more than 60 restaurants, compared with 59 in 2015. The cost of investments in new openings and refurbishment of older restaurants will rise to about 9 billion roubles ($113 million) from 8 billion in 2015.Khasbulatov also said the company had fully recovered from an unprecedented series of regulatory checks in 2014 when it had to temporarily shut many of its restaurants. The closures were viewed broadly as a retaliation by Moscow for Western sanctions. The company had planned to spend 6 billion roubles in 2015 but exceeded that figure as it opened more restaurants than planned, although its profitability declined.  It did not give specific profit figures.""You cannot immediately offset a hike in (supplier) prices with an increase in menu prices, it's a long process.

On Wednesday, Yum said its same-store sales, reflecting underlying growth, also returned to growth in the second half - but more slowly, leaving annual China sales falling for the first time. Researchers and consumers said there's no simple answer to explain why McDonald's is faring better than Yum. A weaker economy and strengthening local rivals are among a complex cocktail of issues both firms must deal with in future strategy, including Yum's China spinoff, due later this year.Yum is still the largest fast food chain in China, but McDonald's has one in-built advantage: the country's diners remain particularly sensitive about chicken products, which were at the heart of the scandal in 2012.""Hearing all the rumours about chickens, I now very rarely go to KFC or eat McDonald's chicken wings."" said Yang Luo, 26, a sales manager in Shanghai.

591,"  (Adds missing word in first paragraph)HONG KONG/SINGAPORE, April 20 A group of investors comprising sovereign wealth fund China Investment Corp (CIC), KKR & Co and Baring Private Equity Asia is in talks to buy a controlling stake in Yum Brands Inc's  China unit, people familiar with the matter said.Yum Brands, owner of the Pizza Hut and KFC fast food chains plans to spin off its 6,900 China restaurants by the end of 2016. The China unit accounts for about half of its parent's total sales and is valued at about $10 billion, based on its core earnings, bankers and analysts estimate.The U.S.-based company had initially planned to sell a stake of about 20 percent in the China operation to anchor investors ahead of a planned listing of the business in New York Exchange and possibly in Hong Kong.But the deal structure is being reworked as acquiring a minority stake is less appealing for buyout firms, making it difficult for them to secure debt funding to finance the deal. It wasn't immediately clear how much the investor group plans to pay for Yum's China business. Bloomberg first reported the news and said the deal could vale Yum China at between $7 billion-$8 billion..According to people familiar with the transactions, speaking on condition of anonymity because the talks were confidential, it was unclear whether Yum would agree to sell a majority stake, as disposing of more than 20 percent of the China business would attract a higher tax bill. Yum, still the largest fast food chain in China, has been losing ground to McDonald's Corp as both strive to revive flagging sales in the teeth of growing competition from local rivals and a slowing economy.McDonald's itself is changing its business model in Asia by planning to bring in partners to own a majority of its restaurants within a franchise operation. Chinese diners once flocked to Yum outlets - and to McDonald's - helping drive revenue growth of nearly 30 percent a year between 2006 and 2012. But Yum's China sales dipped 0.4 percent in 2015, after two flat years, underlining how managers have struggled to repair its reputation since the food safety scares.CIC, KKR and Baring declined to comment.Yum said in a statement that it is making good progress since it announced the planned separation of Yum and Yum China and will provide updates on the transaction at appropriate times. It didn't comment on any potential deal with the group of investors.Yum shares dropped 0.6 percent on Tuesday, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.3 percent.

592,"   By Yashaswini Swamynathan and Lisa Baertlein  McDonald's Corp's (MCD.N) quarterly earnings jumped more than expected in the latest quarter, as all-day breakfasts and new meal deals lured more diners to its U.S. restaurants which contribute about 40 percent of overall profit.Shares in the world's largest fast-food chain are up nearly 28 percent from a year ago, when then-new Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook launched a turnaround plan that has included simplifying sprawling menus and improving speed and service to counter intense competition from the likes of Burger King (QSR.TO), Dunkin' Donuts (DNKN.O) and Shake Shack Inc (SHAK.N). Sales at McDonald's U.S. restaurants open at least 13 months grew 5.4 percent in the first quarter, outpacing the 4.6 percent gain expected by analysts, according to research firm Consensus Metrix. All-day breakfast, launched in October, has been a hit with U.S. customers looking for thrifty options. The company also got a lift from a $5 McPick promotional offer, which allowed diners to choose two items from a menu that included the Big Mac and Quarter Pounder with Cheese. ""Customers in the U.S. are noticing a difference,"" Easterbrook said on a conference call with analysts and investors. He added that McDonald's plans to stick with its current turnaround plan for at least two more quarters before transition to a longer-term strategy. While the first-quarter results topped Wall Street estimates, Chief Financial Officer Kevin Ozan cautioned that McDonald's continues to expect variability in quarterly results, due to regional economic challenges and other factors. McDonald's global sales at established restaurants rose 6.2 percent, the biggest leap in three quarters. That was due, in part, to strength markets such as China, Japan and Russia.  The net income attributable to McDonald's rose to $1.1 billion, or $1.23 per share, beating the average analyst estimate of $1.16 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net revenue fell 1 percent to $5.90 billion, but topped the average estimate of $5.82 billion. The revenue decline was the smallest in seven quarters. Excluding the impact of a strong dollar, revenue rose 3 percent. McDonald's, which also has been closing poorly performing units, selling company-run restaurants to independent operators and cutting overhead, said total operating costs fell nearly 10 percent.Shares in McDonald's which are trading near all-time highs, were up 0.3 percent at $126.17 in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

598,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, April 26 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'BBB+' rating to  McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) multi-tranche debt issuance. The Rating  Outlook is Negative. The EUR2.5 billion issuance includes four-year, seven-year,  and twelve-year fixed-rate senior unsecured notes. At Dec. 31, 2015, McDonald's  had $24 billion of total debt. A full list of ratings follows at the end of this  release. The notes, which rank pari passu with existing debt, are being issued under  McDonald's U.S. global medium-term notes program dated Nov. 13, 2014. Terms do  not include financial covenants. Proceeds will be used for general corporate  purposes, inclusive of share repurchases. McDonald's ratings balance the company's aggressive financial strategy with its  substantial cash flow, significant scale, and the strength of its brand. Key  rating drivers include on-going comp trends, the company's financial strategy,  and continued progress with refranchising and cost reduction efforts. Fitch  projects total debt/EBITDA and total adjusted debt/EBITDAR will be sustained in  the high-2.0x and mid-3.0x range, respectively, over the intermediate term. KEY RATING DRIVERS Sustainability of Recent Positive Comparable Sales Trend McDonald's global comparable sales (comps) have increased at a mid-single-digit  rate for three consecutive quarters, rising 6% in the quarter ended Mar. 31,  2016, after being negative for two consecutive years. All segments are  contributing to the recent improvement. Comps increased 5.4% in the U.S., 5.2%  across International Lead markets, 3.6% in High Growth markets, and 11% in  Foundational markets in the latest quarter. Consolidated guest counts rose 1.8%. Fitch believes McDonald's is making meaningful progress with its turnaround plan  and that recent comp strength can be attributed in part to the launch of All-Day  Breakfast in the U.S., a renewed focus on restaurant operations, and a continued  focus on value around the world. Fitch expects at least 3% growth in 2016 due to  continued consumer excitement around All-Day Breakfast, the company's current  Monopoly promotion in the U.S., and the pending launch of a national value  platform. Whether at least 2% comp growth can be sustained over time will become  more evident as the company laps easy prior year comparisons.  Aggressive Financial Strategy, Increased Leverage In November 2015, McDonald's announced plans to increase cash returned to  shareholders via dividends and share repurchases to about $30 billion during the  three-year period ending 2016, up from $20 billion previously. The company has  issued approximately $12.6 of incremental debt over the past year to help fund  the cash-return goal. Fitch assumes debt will be sustained at around the current  level over the near term and projects total debt/EBITDA and total adjusted  debt/EBITDAR will be approximately 2.8x and 3.6x, respectively, for 2016.  Shift Toward a Higher Mix of Franchised Units McDonald's intends to increase the percentage of its global system that is  franchised to 93% by the end of 2018 from 81% currently by selling 4,000 units  to operators. Longer term McDonald's strives to become 95% franchised.  Refranchising will mainly occur in McDonald's High Growth and Foundational  market segments which are currently 46% and 91% franchised, respectively. High  Growth markets include China, Italy, Poland, Russia, South Korea, Spain,  Switzerland, and the Netherlands. Foundational markets include various countries  outside of the U.S. and International Lead markets (Australia, Canada, France,  Germany, and the U.K.). McDonald's has refranchised about 700 units over the  past five quarters. Fitch views McDonald's shift towards a higher mix of franchised units as  consistent with industry trends. Franchising increases the stability and quality  of cash flows, given that it produces a steady stream of royalty and rental  income and has low capital requirements. This assumes franchisees remain  financially healthy, continue to invest in their operations, and drive positive  growth. Fitch anticipates that capital expenditures will decline meaningfully  from approximately $2 billion expected for 2016, if the company successfully  meets its goal.  Significant Cost Reductions McDonald's is targeting $500 million of annualized G&A cost reductions with the  vast majority being realized by the end of 2017. The goal represents nearly 20%  of McDonald's $2.6 billion expense base at the beginning of 2015. Savings will  be realized through refranchising, lower corporate overhead, and greater  efficiencies across global business services. The company expects to realize  $150 million of savings by the end of 2016. Fitch anticipates savings to  accelerate with the pace of refranchising and, along with incremental royalty  and rental-based income, to help offset operating income declines associated  with the sale of company-operated restaurants.  KEY ASSUMPTIONS --Positive low-single-digit SSS growth of about 3% in 2016 and 2% beyond; --Operating income grows at a high-single-digit rate in 2016 but increases at a  slower rate thereafter due to refranchising; --Total debt is sustained in the $26 billion range in 2016;  --Free cash flow (FCF) is approximately $1 billion - $1.5 billion annually; --Total debt/EBITDA and total adjusted debt-to-operating EBITDAR (defined as  total debt plus 8x gross rents-to-operating EBITDA plus gross rents) are  sustained in the high 2.0x and mid-3.0x range, respectively, over the  intermediate term.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a positive  rating action include:  --Fitch's view that McDonald's can sustain positive low-single-digit SSS and  that market share has stabilized; --Continued meaningful progress with refranchising and realization of cost  savings; --Total adjusted debt-to-operating EBITDAR sustained in the low-3.0x range.  Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a negative  rating action include:  --The inability to sustain positive comps which would indicate market share  losses; --The lack of meaningful progress with refranchising and realization of cost  savings due to higher than expected investments in the business being an offset;  --Total adjusted debt-to-operating EBITDAR sustained in the mid-3.0x range due  to weaker than expected operating results and share buybacks.  LIQUIDITY AND MATURITIES McDonald's liquidity is supported by its large cash balance, free cash flow  (FCF; cash from operations less capex and dividends), and an undrawn revolving  credit facility that expires December 2019. At Dec. 31, 2015, McDonald's had  $10.2 billion of liquidity consisting of $7.7 billion of cash, the majority of  which is expected to be deployed to share buybacks, and $2.5 billion revolver  availability. FCF typically exceeds $1 billion annually and was $1.5 billion for  2015. Aggregate maturities of long-term debt over the next three years at Dec.  31, 2015 are approximately $1.1 billion in 2017 and $1.8 billion in 2018. No  maturities exist for 2016. Fitch anticipates debt will be refinanced given  McDonald's shareholder-friendly financial strategy.  McDonald's current ratings are as follows:  --Long-term IDR 'BBB+'; --Bank credit facilities 'BBB+'; --Senior unsecured debt 'BBB+'; --Short-term IDR 'F2'; --Commercial paper 'F2'.  The Rating Outlook is Negative.

603,"   By Anton Zverev and Maria Kiselyova | MOSCOW  MOSCOW The McDonald's (MCD.N) fast food chain said its lawyers were investigating after entrepreneurs in separatist-controlled eastern Ukraine started selling McDonald's-style hamburgers out of a restaurant that the company shut down two years ago.The company said it pulled out of the Ukrainian city of Luhansk in May 2014 for security reasons after pro-Russian insurgents mounted an armed uprising there against Kiev's rule, and unilaterally declared the region's independence.But since then, the company said, the restaurant premises in Luhansk was unlawfully taken over. Photographs sent to Reuters by a witness on Friday showed the restaurant was now open and selling fries and burgers that look similar to those served in McDonald's restaurants worldwide. All McDonald's branding and logos had, however, been removed from the restaurant. On the outside of the building, the McDonald's sign had been doctored to leave only the letters ""Mc"", and the blue-red-and-light blue flag of the self-proclaimed Luhansk People's Republic was attached to the roof.""Our lawyers are working on this issue,"" said a spokeswoman for McDonald's in Ukraine. The region around Luhansk and the neighboring city of Donetsk are under Kiev's rule in the eyes of international law but are de facto under the control of separatist administrations which are not internationally recognized.The United States and European Union imposed sanctions on many of the separatist leaders, and their backers in Russia, alleging they colluded to unlawfully seize the territory. The separatists and Moscow said they had to act to protect their regions from persecution by Kiev.The region's unrecognized status makes enforcing property rights enshrined in international law difficult. Photographs posted on social media this week showed the Luhansk restaurant selling food wrapped in McDonald's branded packaging, but Reuters could not immediately verify their authenticity. On Friday, the packaging being used carried no McDonald's branding, and customers were instead being offered plain white plastic bags in which to take their orders home.The spokeswoman for McDonald's Ukrainian operation said no one had asked the company if they could re-open the branch in Luhansk.  ""The illegal use of trademarks, names and images of products that belong to McDonald's is an example of the violation of the company's intellectual property rights,"" she added. ""In such cases, the corporation reserves the right to resolve questions of the illegal use of the company's names or images using the means set out by law.""It was not clear who was operating the business in the McDonald's restaurant in Luhansk. People answering the phone at two numbers listed for the restaurant said they had no connection to the business.An official in the legal department of the separatists' trade ministry in Luhansk said he knew nothing about the issue and that officials had taken no action.

607,"   By Lisa Baertlein | LOS ANGELES  LOS ANGELES Spurred by recent successes, U.S. low-wage workers next week plan to make McDonald's Corp (MCD.N) and its annual shareholder meeting the target of major protests calling for $15 per hour and the right to unionize.The union-backed ""Fight for $15"" campaign on Thursday said the actions will start with a Chicago fast-food worker strike on May 25. That same day, it will kick off two days of protests at McDonald's headquarters in Oak Brook, Illinois, where the fast-food company will host its annual meeting on May 26. Organizers said the Oak Brook protest will be bigger and more aggressive than ever before. The campaign since 2012 has had a key role in convincing some lawmakers and major employers to boost long-stagnant minimum wages and explore other ways to improve working conditions for scores of Americans whose jobs range from flipping hamburgers to caring for the elderly.Ke'Jioun Johnson, 20, works at a McDonald's restaurant in uptown Chicago and plans to join the protests for the second year in a row. Johnson's pay went from $8.25 to $10 per hour in July after Chicago began phasing in a hike that will take the city's minimum wage to $13 by 2019.  While he is inspired by pay victories in his hometown and states like California and New York, Johnson said much more needs to be done to protect workers. For example, he and other restaurant and retail workers want to stop employers' cost-saving practice of cutting short scheduled shifts when business is slow. ""We're not just about $15 per hour. We're going to keep fighting until we get union rights,"" said Johnson. ""It's what we need to survive - a living wage and the hours to live off of.""  McDonald's Corp in July raised the average pay and began offering paid vacations and other benefits for the roughly 90,000 workers in the U.S. restaurants it operates. Most McDonald's workers, however, are employed by franchisees. They company's stock is trading near all-time highs, spurred by a profit-boosting turnaround plan that includes all-day breakfast. McDonald's did not immediately comment for this story. Business owners who oppose pay hikes say the additional expense puts jobs at risk. Workers like Johnson argue that well-compensated workers do a better job. That could make a big difference at a fast-food chain, where every second of speed matters.

Louisville, Kentucky-based Yum Brands, owner of the Pizza Hut and KFC fast food chains, aims to spin off its 7,205 China restaurants by the end of 2016, amid pressure from activist investor Corvex Management, whose founder, Keith Meister, is on Yum's board.The second round of bids for the stake up for sale - around 20 percent of the business - are due by the end of this month, the people said, declining to be identified because the information was confidential.Yum's entire China unit is valued between $8 billion and $11 billion, based on its core earnings of about $1 billion, the people said.""I will tell you as a large shareholder, the Yum board selling this business for $7 or $8 billion is not the right thing, and I don't think anyone would disagree about that,"" Corvex's Meister told CNBC in a recent interview. Corvex owns 5.2 percent of Yum, according to Thomson Reuters data.Yum, still the largest fast food chain in China, has been losing ground to McDonald's Corp (MCD.N) as they both strive to revive flagging sales in the teeth of growing competition from local rivals and a slowing economy. In the latest quarter, Yum's China sales grew faster than Wall Street estimates, raising expectations that a key profit driver for Yum is showing signs of stability after battling many quarters of disappointing sales.Yum shares haven risen 9.7 percent in New York so far this year, while the S&P 500 Index .SPX has been flat in the same period.Some bidders would be keen to buy control of the China business, the people said, but they noted that Yum is sticking to the minority stake sale plan because it is more tax-efficient. It was not clear if these bidders would pursue a transaction if Yum does not adjust plans and offer a controlling stake for sale, the people said.A Yum spokeswoman declined to comment on prospective bidders. She said, ""We continue to make good progress since we announced the transaction separating Yum and Yum China into powerful, independent, focused companies by the end of 2016."" KKR and Temasek declined to comment. China sovereign wealth fund CIC did not immediately respond to a request for comment. While Temasek, which manages about $190 billion in assets, has about 28 percent of its portfolio in the financial sector, it has been placing more bets in consumer companies of late.In 2014, it bought almost a quarter of health and beauty retailer A.S. Watson, backed by Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing, for about $5.7 billion in its single biggest investment. Last year it was also part of a private equity consortium led by MBK Partners that bought British supermarket retailer Tesco PLC's (TSCO.L) South Korea business.

The picketers are part of a national ""Fight for $15"" movement that, along with an improving job market, has spurred wage hikes at major employers such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc and McDonald's, though not to the level demanded by protesters.Current and former fast-food executives have said a $15 hourly wage would force restaurants to replace workers with kiosks, robotic french fry baggers, automatic pancake flippers and other technology.""I don't see it being a risk to job elimination,"" Easterbrook said when asked about the wage/robot theory. ""Ultimately we're in the service business. We will always have an important human element."" Easterbrook has cited improved customer service as a key reason for McDonald's recent turnaround. Higher pay and technological advances are more likely to result in workers being shifted to dining rooms and more service-oriented roles, he said.  McDonald's last summer increased average worker pay to almost $10 per hour. But those raises were limited to just a fraction of all U.S. McDonald's restaurant workers because franchisees operate almost 90 percent of the chain's 14,000 domestic locations.

616,"  PARIS French investigators searched McDonald's (MCD.N) French headquarters on May 18, targeting the U.S. fast food chain in a tax probe, sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Thursday.A preliminary inquiry had been opened early this year after former investigating magistrate and politician Eva Joly filed a lawsuit in December on behalf of an employee committee, a judicial source said.""A search was indeed carried out at McDonald's headquarters in France on May 18,"" the other source said, confirming a report first carried by Les Echos business daily.The judicial source said that ""many documents"" had been seized during the raid.French business magazine L'Expansion reported last month that authorities had sent McDonald's France a 300 million euro  ($336 million) bill for unpaid taxes on profits believed to have been funneled through Luxembourg and Switzerland. It said tax officials had accused the giant U.S. burger chain of using a Luxembourg-based entity, McD Europe Franchising, to shift profits to lower-tax jurisdictions by billing the French division excessively for use of the company brand and other services.The judicial source confirmed the investigation was looking into this. McDonald's declined to comment on the search, referring back to past comments that it is proud to be one of the biggest tax payers in France.A spokeswoman for the French budget ministry declined to comment because of the confidentiality of particular tax matters. News of the search emerged after dozens of French police raided Google's Paris headquarters on Tuesday as part of a tax evasion investigation.

629,"  LOS ANGELES, June 20 The union backing a high-profile campaign to raise pay and improve working conditions for low-wage U.S. workers on Monday warned potential buyers of roughly 3,000 McDonald's Corp restaurants in Asia that such deals could saddle them with operational risks, including significant costs and liabilities.While it is not uncommon for U.S. unions to weigh in on corporate mergers or other agreements that could affect the workers they represent, the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) is acting on behalf of fast-food workers who are not unionized.McDonald's, the world's biggest restaurant chain by revenue, is seeking local partners to expand its Asia business. It aims to sell restaurants in China, Hong Kong, South Korea and Taiwan, as well as a portion of its stake in McDonald's Japan.""We believe McDonald's past practices pose risks for its future licensees, those firms' investors, McDonald's franchisees in Asia, and the workers employed at McDonald's stores,"" SEIU Executive Vice President Scott Courtney said in a letter sent via email and regular mail to firms including KKR China, Baring Private Equity Asia and New Hope Group. McDonald's and the firms targeted by SEIU did not immediately provide comment.The SEIU has spent tens of millions of dollars on a multiyear campaign, including frequent public marches and protests, to improve the plight of low-wage retail and fast-food workers. Last year the union pressed the Federal Trade Commission to investigate alleged abusive practices by major franchisors, including McDonald's Corp and 7-Eleven Inc . Among other things, SEIU warned the royalties paid to McDonald's by some international licensees have been set to rise over time. The royalties are based on a percentage of sales and insulate McDonald's from the uncertainty of changing labor, food and other operating costs that are borne by franchisees. The union noted that Arcos Dorados Holdings Inc, McDonald's largest global franchisee, has had a rocky run since its initial public offering in 2011.Arcos Dorados has struggled with currency woes and economic turbulence in the Latin American region where it operates. Its shares trade below $5, far below their IPO price of $17.McDonald's business in China was hurt after a 2014 meat supplier scandal that also battered sales in other countries in the region.

642,"   By Lisa Baertlein  McDonald's Corp (MCD.N) said the U.S. restaurant industry will raise prices far more than supermarkets this year, sending a chill through a sector that is searching for ways to protect itself from higher worker wages. The forecast and weak quarterly sales at domestic McDonald's restaurants sent shares in the world's biggest restaurant company down 4.5 percent to $121.71 and pulled down most of the restaurant sector. The Dow Jones U.S. Restaurants & Bars Index .DJUSRU was off 2.2 percent. The world's biggest fast-food chain gets roughly one-third of its revenue and 40 percent of profits from the United States.The food service industry is harder hit by state and local minimum wage increases because it employs more minimum wage workers than any other occupation. Some planned minimum wage hikes will more than double the prevailing wage to $15 per hour over time.    The second-quarter report from McDonald's landed after chains such as Dunkin' Brands Group Inc (DNKN.O), Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) and Wendy's Co (WEN.O) also reported disappointing results for the latest quarter in large part due to weak customer traffic. Restaurant food inflation is outpacing the increases at supermarkets and the gap is widening, McDonald's Chief Financial Officer Kevin Ozan said on a conference call with analysts.Food-at-home inflation is expected to be flat to up about 1 percent for this year, while food-away-from-home inflation is expected to be up 2.5 percent to 3.5 percent, he said.Bernstein analyst Sara Senatore said restaurant companies, which are grappling with profit-squeezing minimum wage increases, use more labor than grocery stores and have the extra burden of trying to convince franchisees to hold back on price increases aimed at offsetting higher labor costs.      ""Food prices are coming down, but labor is not. That's doubly bad for restaurants,"" Senatore said. ""It's hard to convince everybody to operate in lock step.""When franchisees raise prices, she said, ""it just makes their prices look even higher relative to grocery stores.""Restaurant executives also pinned part of the blame for the second-quarter softness on the fractious U.S. presidential election and uncertainty spawned by terrorist attacks around the world. ""I think generally there's just a broader level of uncertainty in consumers minds at the moment,"" Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook said on the company's earnings call.  While such events loom as a risk to U.S. consumer spending, that threat was not enough to dissuade the National Retail Federation from boosting its retail sales growth forecast for the remainder of the year from 3.1 percent to 3.4 percent. The forecast excludes spending at restaurants.""There are many factors that could prove to be hurdles but our overall outlook is optimistic,"" NRF chief economist Jack Kleinhenz said in a statement on Tuesday.     McDonald's sales at U.S. restaurants open at least 13 months were up 1.8 percent in the quarter, far less than the 3.2 percent rise that analysts expected, according to research firm Consensus Metrix. McDonald's executives said they expected labor cost pressures to continue, but declined to elaborate. They did, however, note that the company generally needs same-restaurant sales to increase 2 percent to 3 percent to maintain profits.McDonald's total revenue declined 3.5 percent to $6.27 billion, in line with the average analyst estimate, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Net income in the quarter fell 9.1 percent to $1.09 billion, or $1.25 per share, in the quarter.The company recorded pretax charges of about $230 million, or 20 cents per share, in the latest quarter related to its program to sell company-owned stores to franchisees and relocation of its headquarters to Chicago.Excluding items, McDonald's earned $1.45 per share, beating analysts estimate of $1.38.

653,"   By Tom Polansek | OAK BROOK, Ill.  OAK BROOK, Ill. McDonald's Corp (MCD.N) will replace corn syrup in hamburger buns with sugar this month and has removed antibiotics that are important to human medicine from its chicken months ahead of schedule, it said on Monday, moves that are part of its drive to target increasingly health-conscious consumers.    The fast food company also said it eliminated artificial preservatives from Chicken McNuggets and several breakfast items, including scrambled eggs.McDonald's is reacting to a shift in consumer tastes toward healthier, more natural foods and competing with other restaurants that are overhauling their menus to feature items free of processed ingredients.McDonald's USA President Mike Andres told reporters at the company's headquarters that the changes announced on Monday will affect about half its menu and more adjustments would follow. Some consumers have turned away from products containing high-fructose corn syrup, which is derived from corn starch, because of concerns it may be linked to obesity. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has said it is unaware of any differences in the safety of foods containing equal amounts of corn syrup and sugar, or sucrose.  McDonald's is ""following the customers"" in switching to sucrose in buns used on Big Macs, Quarter Pounders, hamburgers and other sandwiches, said Marion Gross, senior vice president of McDonald's North America supply chain.""We know that they don't feel good about high-fructose corn syrup so we're giving them what they're looking for instead,"" she said.McDonald's stopped adding an artificial preservative to the cooking oil used to make Chicken McNuggets and removed artificial preservatives from pork sausage patties, eggs served on McGriddles breakfast sandwiches and scrambled eggs on breakfast platters. It also removed chicken skin, safflower oil and citric acid from the meat of its McNuggets, swapping them for pea starch, rice starch and powdered lemon juice.  Extra costs related to the changes will not be passed on to consumers, partly because a decline in commodity prices has reduced some food expenses, Andres said.Last week, McDonald's said the U.S. restaurant industry will raise prices far more than supermarkets this year, sending a chill through a sector that is searching for ways to protect itself from higher worker wages. McDonald's had previously planned to stop buying chicken raised with antibiotics important to human medicine from its suppliers, Tyson Foods Inc (TSN.N) and Keystone Foods, by March 2017. It completed the change earlier due to quicker than expected work by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which helped to verify that birds were not given the drugs, Gross said.Some health experts have raised concerns that the overuse of antibiotics for poultry may diminish their effectiveness in fighting disease in humans.

655,"   By Lisa Baertlein | LOS ANGELES  LOS ANGELES Wendy's Co, the fifth-largest U.S. fast-food chain by revenue, will quit using chickens raised with antibiotics important to human health by 2017, the company told Reuters on Thursday.Fast-food industry leader McDonald's Corp on Monday said it had completed its shift to using only using chickens raised without antibiotics important to human medicine, months ahead of its estimated March 2017 target. Concern has been growing among public health experts, consumers and shareholders that the overuse of such drugs is contributing to rising numbers of life-threatening human infections from antibiotic-resistant bacteria dubbed ""superbugs.""An estimated 70 percent of antibiotics important to human health are sold for use in meat and dairy production. Veterinary use of antibiotics is legal. However, as the number of human infections from antibiotic-resistant bacteria increases, consumer advocates and public health experts have become more critical of the practice of routinely feeding antibiotics to chickens, cattle and pigs.Wendy's and its chicken suppliers have been working to eliminate all antibiotics important to human medicine from chicken production, the company told Reuters on Thursday. As of June 2016, half of Wendy's chicken supply was raised without medically important antibiotics. Wendy's said it would be at 100 percent by next year.  Wendy's, which purchases more than 250 million pounds of chicken annually, also said it would commit to specific goals for the reduction of antibiotics important to humans in pork and beef production in 2017. With regard to beef, Wendy's said it is engaged with academics and industry experts on work that includes trials for probiotics, vaccines, feed supplements and nutrition composition.  The company posted the new policies to its website on July 28 but did not otherwise publicize the change, before speaking with Reuters.

659,"  * Washington warns $14.5 billion Irish bill may hurt relations* U.S. probe first alerted EU to tax schemes by Apple and others* Senator who chaired hearings blames IRS, says EU 'fills vacuum'By Foo Yun Chee and Alastair MacdonaldBRUSSELS, Aug 30 - The United States is furious at the European Union for handing Apple Inc a $14.5 billion tax demand on Tuesday but EU officials say it was Washington which put them on to the scheme in the first place.It was a U.S. Senate report in May 2013 revealing the tech giant's deal with the Irish government to rule a big slice of its global earnings untaxable that prompted the European Commission to launch its own inquiries the following month.The U.S. Treasury said the Commission's order that Apple pay 13 billion euros in back taxes to Ireland - which the company and Dublin are appealing - endangers EU-U.S. economic relations just as efforts to reach a transatlantic free trade pact unravel .A senior Democratic senator said Brussels had made ""a cheap money grab"" for U.S. revenues. But his party colleague who chaired hearings into Apple's taxes three years ago, Carl Levin, said the Europeans were only trying to take what U.S. authorities had failed to claim by not closing loopholes that allowed firms to hoard profits overseas.""The IRS has failed to stake a claim for U.S. taxes on those revenues,"" he said in a statement, referring to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. ""So Europe attempts to fill the vacuum. Shame on Apple for dodging U.S. taxes. Shame on the IRS for failing to challenge Apple's tax avoidance.""For Marcel Fratzscher, president of leading German economic think-tank DIW Berlin and author of a new book on growing inequality, the mudslinging between politicians reflects how global corporations have exploited competition for investment to blunt states' efforts to co-operate against tax avoidance.""Companies are playing one government against another,"" he told Reuters. EU LISTENED TO SENATE EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, a straight-talking Dane who dismisses talk of leading an anti-American crusade, says the hearings at the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations chaired by Levin were what gave her Spanish  predecessor grounds to demand disclosure by Apple and Ireland. ""The Commission listened and decided to look deeper into the matter,"" Vestager said in June, crediting media reporting and hearings in the British parliament for also providing evidence to help break secrecy around nearly 1,000 cases across Europe.The Commission said in its judgment on Apple that the United States and other countries were welcome to try and claim some of the unpaid taxes for themselves - highlighting just the complaints of Levin and other senators three years ago when they skewered Apple CEO Tim Cook for failing to bring cash home.As well as Apple, Starbucks Corp was ordered to pay more Dutch taxes and Amazon.com Inc and McDonald's Corp  are still being investigated; a series of EU accusations that Google, part of Alphabet Inc, has abused its market power have also fuelled complaints from U.S. President Barack Obama's administration that Europe is out to punish American success.Competition lawyer Pierre Sabbadini said political pressures drove different responses by different authorities. Leaks and public hearings on tax deals had created pressure among voters for the EU to act in 2013, he said, while the size of the companies targeted gave them clout with political leaders, too.""When investigation-target companies have grown to the size of Apple, they can reach out for political support,"" he said.The Obama administration has taken its own action to curb tax avoidance schemes lately. In April, amid public controversy over drug company Pfizer Inc's proposed merger with Allergan Plc of Ireland, it announced plans to curb so-called ""tax inversions"", by which U.S. firms have undertaken cross-border mergers in order to switch to a domicile abroad and so avoid U.S. taxes.Pfizer abandoned the merger.

Andres will be succeeded by Christopher Kempczinski, 47, currently McDonald's executive vice president of strategy, business development and innovation.  Kempczinski came to McDonald's last year from Kraft Foods Group [KRAFTB.UL], where he was executive vice president of growth initiatives and president of its international business.The United States is McDonald's top profit market and analysts said the announcement was unexpected. ""This comes as a surprise,"" Hedgeye Risk Management analyst Howard Penney said. ""The biggest question becomes the continuity of the turnaround,"" said Penney, who added that McDonald's has a deep bench of management talent. Jeff Stratton, who headed McDonald's USA before Andres, was 58 when he retired. He also held the job for about two years.Shares of McDonald's were up 0.3 percent at $115.66 in extended trading.

664,"  (Repeats story filed on Tuesday, no changes)* Washington warns $14.5 billion Irish bill may hurt relations* U.S. probe first alerted EU to tax schemes by Apple and others* Senator who chaired hearings blames IRS, says EU 'fills vacuum'By Foo Yun Chee and Alastair MacdonaldBRUSSELS, Aug 30 The United States is furious at the European Union for handing Apple Inc a $14.5 billion tax demand on Tuesday but EU officials say it was Washington which put them on to the scheme in the first place.It was a U.S. Senate report in May 2013 revealing the tech giant's deal with the Irish government to rule a big slice of its global earnings untaxable that prompted the European Commission to launch its own inquiries the following month.The U.S. Treasury said the Commission's order that Apple pay 13 billion euros in back taxes to Ireland - which the company and Dublin are appealing - endangers EU-U.S. economic relations just as efforts to reach a transatlantic free trade pact unravel . A senior Democratic senator said Brussels had made ""a cheap money grab"" for U.S. revenues.But his party colleague who chaired hearings into Apple's taxes three years ago, Carl Levin, said the Europeans were only trying to take what U.S. authorities had failed to claim by not closing loopholes that allowed firms to hoard profits overseas.""The IRS has failed to stake a claim for U.S. taxes on those revenues,"" he said in a statement, referring to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. ""So Europe attempts to fill the vacuum. Shame on Apple for dodging U.S. taxes. Shame on the IRS for failing to challenge Apple's tax avoidance.""For Marcel Fratzscher, president of leading German economic think-tank DIW Berlin and author of a new book on growing inequality, the mudslinging between politicians reflects how global corporations have exploited competition for investment to blunt states' efforts to co-operate against tax avoidance. ""Companies are playing one government against another,"" he told Reuters.EU LISTENED TO SENATE EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, a straight-talking Dane who dismisses talk of leading an anti-American crusade, says the hearings at the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations chaired by Levin were what gave her Spanish  predecessor grounds to demand disclosure by Apple and Ireland. ""The Commission listened and decided to look deeper into the matter,"" Vestager said in June, crediting media reporting and hearings in the British parliament for also providing evidence to help break secrecy around nearly 1,000 cases across Europe.The Commission said in its judgment on Apple that the United States and other countries were welcome to try and claim some of the unpaid taxes for themselves - highlighting just the complaints of Levin and other senators three years ago when they skewered Apple CEO Tim Cook for failing to bring cash home.As well as Apple, Starbucks Corp was ordered to pay more Dutch taxes and Amazon.com Inc and McDonald's Corp  are still being investigated; a series of EU accusations that Google, part of Alphabet Inc, has abused its market power have also fuelled complaints from U.S. President Barack Obama's administration that Europe is out to punish American success.Competition lawyer Pierre Sabbadini said political pressures drove different responses by different authorities. Leaks and public hearings on tax deals had created pressure among voters for the EU to act in 2013, he said, while the size of the companies targeted gave them clout with political leaders, too.""When investigation-target companies have grown to the size of Apple, they can reach out for political support,"" he said.The Obama administration has taken its own action to curb tax avoidance schemes lately. In April, amid public controversy over drug company Pfizer Inc's proposed merger with Allergan Plc of Ireland, it announced plans to curb so-called ""tax inversions"", by which U.S. firms have undertaken cross-border mergers in order to switch to a domicile abroad and so avoid U.S. taxes.Pfizer abandoned the merger.

665,"   By Foo Yun Chee and Padraic Halpin | BRUSSELS/DUBLIN  BRUSSELS/DUBLIN The European Commission ordered Apple Inc to pay Ireland unpaid taxes of up to 13 billion euros ($14.5 billion) on Tuesday as it ruled the firm had received illegal state aid.Apple and Dublin said the U.S. company's tax treatment was in line with Irish and European Union law and they would appeal the ruling, which is part of a drive against what the EU says are sweetheart tax deals that usually smaller states in the bloc offer multinational companies to lure jobs and investment.The U.S. feels its firms are being targeted by the EU and a U.S. Treasury spokesperson warned the move threatens to undermine U.S. investment in Europe and ""the important spirit of economic partnership between the U.S. and the EU.""    Starbucks Corp has been ordered to pay up to 30 million euros ($33 million) to the Dutch state, while Amazon.com Inc and McDonald's Corp are also under investigation by the Commission, the EU's executive arm. Apple's stock fell less than 1 percent.EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager questioned how anyone might think an arrangement that allowed Apple to pay a tax rate of 0.005 percent, as Apple's main Irish unit did in 2014, was fair.""Tax rulings granted by Ireland have artificially reduced Apple's tax burden for over two decades, in breach of the EU state aid rules. Apple now has to repay the benefits,"" Vestager told a news conference.  Analysts said the size of the claim underlined the Commission's aggressive stance, but since each case involves different circumstances and tax rules, lawyers said it was hard to see if further big claims were any more or less likely.Apple, which had more than $200 billion in cash and readily marketable securities at the end of June, is likely to see the case drag out for years in EU and possibly Irish courts. Apple warned investors in a July regulatory filing that the Commission's investigation could lead to ""material"" liability for further tax payments, but that it could not estimate the impact. On Tuesday the company said it expects to place ""some amount of cash"" in an escrow account.Tax experts say the European Commission faces a tough battle to convince courts to back up its stand. While the EU has found that certain tax regulations are anti-competitive, it has never before ruled whether countries have applied tax regulations fairly in the way it has with Apple, Starbucks and others. As a result, some lawyers and accountants said they doubted Apple would end up paying back any tax.“I am not persuaded by the reasoning the EU has applied,” said Tim Wach, global managing director at international tax advisers Taxand. ""ARTIFICIAL"" ARRANGEMENT    The EU's ruling challenges the way that Ireland agreed to tax the profits of Irish-registered Apple subsidiaries, through which most of its non-U.S. profits flowed.Apple Inc licenses the rights to technology designed in the United States to Irish subsidiaries. These then hire contract manufacturers to make devices which they sell to Apple retail subsidiaries around Europe and Asia. Since the manufacturing cost is a small portion of device sales prices and retail subsidiaries are allocated a small operating margin, Apple Ireland is very profitable. In 2011, it earned $22 billion after paying $2 billion to its U.S. parent in relation to the rights to Apple intellectual property.However, the Irish tax authority agreed only 50 million euros of this was taxable in Ireland, the European Commission said. Under the terms of Apple’s tax deal, first agreed in 1991 and renewed in 2007, Apple could allocate most of the profits earned by its Irish operating units to a ""head office"" that did not have any employees or own any premises.“This 'head office' had no operating capacity to handle and manage the distribution business, or any other substantive business for that matter,” the Commission said.The Commission said this agreement had no basis in tax law and was not available to others, and so represented state aid.Irish Finance Minister Michael Noonan said he profoundly disagreed with the decision and in order to preserve Ireland’s attractiveness for investment he would appeal. ""There is no economic basis for this decision. It's bizarre and it's an exercise in politics by the Competition Commission,"" Noonan said.""They don't have responsibility for taxes and they are opening a back door through state aid to influence tax policy in European countries when the European treaties say tax policy is a matter for sovereign governments,"" he added.Ireland's low corporate tax rate has been a cornerstone of the country’s economic policy for decades, drawing investors from multinational companies whose staff account for almost one in 10 of the country's workers.For many technology firms like Google and Facebook, a key attraction is that Ireland allows companies to adopt tax structures which see them pay much less than the 12.5 percent headline rate. The companies say they follow all tax rules.Apple said it was confident of winning an appeal.""The European Commission has launched an effort to rewrite Apple’s history in Europe, ignore Ireland’s tax laws and upend the international tax system in the process,"" CEO Tim Cook said in a letter to customers posted on Apple's website. ""A company’s profits should be taxed in the country where the value is created,"" he added.U.S. OPPOSITION    The U.S. Treasury Department published a white paper last week in which it said it was looking at possible responses to what it sees as unfair targeting of its firms, which could include extra taxes on the U.S. arms of European companies.The paper noted that the EU executive's tax rulings could cost the U.S. exchequer money. Under U.S. tax law, Apple's Irish profits are taxable if brought back to the United States – something the company would have to do if it wanted to use the money to pay dividends.But any tax paid in Europe is reduced from the tax due in the United States. The Treasury has said the Commission’s approach was at odds with EU tax law and international treaties.The Commission, which has also ruled European companies including carmaker Fiat and Swedish engineer Atlas Copco AB must pay tax claims worth over $350 million, said its application of competition law to tax rulings followed EU law and treated all companies equally.Nonetheless, the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg have already appealed EU rulings against their tax deals with multinationals.

""Given that the acquiring group is not here at all in South Africa we found that, if approved, it is unlikely to substantially lessen or present competition,"" said the commission's spokesman Itumeleng Lesofe, without elaborating.  In May 2014, Ramaphosa announced his complete disinvestment from Shanduka to avoid conflicts of interest with his government duties after President Jacob Zuma named him deputy president. Ramaphosa founded the company in 2001.

679,"   By Daniel Wiessner  A union-backed group said it had filed complaints on behalf of 15 U.S. McDonald's workers who say they were sexually harassed on the job, in the latest challenge to how the fast-food company and its franchisees treat employees.Fight for $15, which has organized strikes and protests calling for employers to raise wages, said on Wednesday that it filed the administrative complaints with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission against McDonald's USA LLC and individual franchisees in eight states over the last month.  Cycei Monae, a McDonald's worker in Flint, Michigan, said a manager showed her a picture of his genitals and said he wanted to ""do things"" to her, according to a complaint provided by Fight for $15. Corporate officials ignored her complaints, Monae said on a phone call with reporters on Wednesday.In another complaint, a worker in Folsom, California, said a supervisor offered her $1,000 for oral sex.  Thirteen of the complaints were by women, and two were by men, said Fight for $15, which the Service Employees International Union formed in 2012.“As the country’s second-largest employer, McDonald’s has a responsibility to set standards in both the fast-food industry and the economy overall,” Kendall Fells, organizing director for Fight for $15, said in a statement. McDonald's spokeswoman Terri Hickey said the company takes harassment complaints seriously and was reviewing the allegations. ""At McDonald’s, we and our independent owner-operators share a deep commitment to the respectful treatment of everyone,"" she said in a statement.The EEOC, a federal agency that enforces discrimination laws, does not comment on complaints it receives, it said. It can file lawsuits on workers' behalf or grant them permission to bring their own cases.  While most of the complaints were filed on behalf of employees at franchised restaurants that McDonald's Corp does not own, all of them say the company is responsible for the harassment because it controls working conditions there. McDonald's is also facing a class-action lawsuit in federal court in San Francisco by 800 workers at several franchised restaurants who say they are owed overtime pay and were forced to skip breaks.  The company has denied that it is a ""joint employer,"" a designation that could render it liable for labor law violations by franchisees and require it to bargain with workers at those restaurants if they unionize. In a case before the National Labor Relations Board, Fight for $15 claims the company is a joint employer of franchise workers who say they faced retaliation for joining in nationwide strikes organized by the group. McDonald's has said it neither retaliated against workers at its own restaurants nor instructed franchisees to do so.",2016-10-05,MCD,"Wed Oct 5, 2016 | 1:02pm EDT","McDonald's, franchisees hit with sexual harassment complaints",http://www.reuters.com//article/mcdonalds-complaint-idUSL2N1CB179?type=companyNews
680,"   By Carol Zhong and Anshuman Daga | HONG KONG/SINGAPORE  HONG KONG/SINGAPORE McDonald's Corp (MCD.N) is set to agree a deal to sell 20-year franchise rights for its Singapore and Malaysia outlets to Saudi Arabia's Reza group for up to $400 million, as part of a re-jig of its Asian business, people familiar with the matter said.Reza Food Services Co. Ltd, which owns and operates McDonald's restaurants in the western and southern region of Saudi Arabia, has tapped Malaysian bank CIMB (CIMB.KL) to finance the transaction, said two of the sources, who declined to be identified as the deal has not been publicly announced.The move is in line with McDonald's plans to bring in partners as it switches to a less capital-intensive franchise model in Asia.One person familiar with the Southeast Asian deal said McDonald's was keen to tie up with regional family-owned groups and local tycoons as it sought out long-term partners rather than buyout firms, which usually cash out of a business after a few years. Basic terms of the agreement had been finalised and the deal was expected to be completed by the year-end, the person said.CIMB declined to comment, while there was no immediate response from McDonald's. Reuters was not immediately able to reach Reza for a comment. Sources said CIMB would provide the bulk of the term loan to back the deal, and the financing would be denominated in both Malaysian ringgit and Singapore dollars.In July, McDonald's had said it was seeking franchise partners for its restaurants in Singapore and Malaysia and was negotiating with parties, but did not provide any details or a timeline. McDonald's has about 120 restaurants in Singapore and about 260 in Malaysia.Citing sources, Reuters reported last month that McDonald's had received final bids from at least three groups for its China and Hong Kong outlets.

Sales at established U.S. restaurants rose 1.3 percent, amid industry softness that executives partly blamed on lower grocery prices that encouraged some diners to cook at home. The result from the United States, which accounts for about 40 percent of overall profit at McDonald's, just exceeded analysts' lowered expectations, and was not as robust as the 2 percent U.S. same-store sales gain reported by rival Dunkin' Brands Group Inc (DNKN.O) on Thursday. McDonald's international restaurants easily beat expectations on same-store sales growth in Britain, Australia, Canada and Germany. As a result, global sales at restaurants open at least 13 months rose 3.5 percent for the third quarter, handily beating the 1.5 percent average gain expected by analysts. McDonald's Chief Executive Officer Steve Easterbrook has vowed to transform the 60-year-old chain into a ""modern, progressive burger company."" He has introduced the all-day breakfast, banned the use of medically important antibiotics in U.S. chicken, and has been working to speed up service and make it friendlier.Shares of McDonald's closed up 3 percent to $113.93, despite analyst warnings that fourth-quarter U.S. same-store sales could drop 2 percent due to the high bar set by the debut of the all-day breakfast in October 2015.RBC Capital Markets analyst David Palmer pressed executives on the conference call about what they will do next, given the ""common perception"" that all-day breakfast and McPick ""are running out of gas as sales drivers"" in the United States.    Easterbrook said international restaurants' ""experience of the future"" efforts, including digital kiosks and mobile apps, could bolster domestic operations.    The world's largest fast-food chain's net income increased 2.6 percent to $1.28 billion, or $1.50 per share, helped by lower food costs, cost cuts such as workforce reductions and better-than-expected global restaurant sales.

Comparable sales in the United States and Canada fell 0.5 percent.McDonald's Corp raised expectations across the fast-food industry last week after posting a better-than-expected 1.3 percent rise in U.S. restaurants.""In light of McDonald's more robust numbers, it is disappointing that Burger King did not push into positive territory,"" Neil Saunders, CEO of retail research firm Conlumino, wrote in a note.U.S. burger chains, including McDonald's, Burger King and Wendy's Co, are battling intense competition from upstart chains and meal-kit sellers.The sector is also under pressure from a drop in grocery prices, a trend that is encouraging more people to eat at home. Burger King introduced new menu items such as Whopperrito, a burger-burrito mash-up, and Cheetos Chicken Fries, but the launches failed to attract more customers.""Burger King has more work to do to increase its appeal – including focusing on core lines and the overall restaurant experience,"" Saunders wrote.Total comparable sales at Tim Hortons, which operates mainly in Canada, rose 2 percent in the third quarter, compared with a growth of 5.3 percent last year, when new lunchtime offers boosted growth.Restaurant Brands' net profit attributable to shareholders rose to $86.3 million, or 36 cents per share, from $49.6 million, or 24 cents per share, a year earlier. Total costs and expenses fell 3 percent to $655.2 million.Excluding items, the company earned 43 cents per share, beating the analysts' average estimate of 40 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Stephens analyst Will Slabaugh said the quarter's performance was ""sufficient."" ""QSR remains one of the few restaurants where investors can easily draw a multi-year path to margin improvement and earnings upside.""Oakville, Ontario-based Restaurant Brands' revenue rose 5.5 percent to $1.08 billion, beating analysts' estimate of $1.06 billion.The company raised its quarterly dividend to 17 cents per share from 16 cents.U.S.-listed shares of Restaurant Brands were down 2.1 percent at $46.01 in early trading.

696,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, November 07 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has downgraded the Long-Term Issuer  Default Rating (IDR) of McDonald's Corporation (NYSE: MCD) to 'BBB' from 'BBB+'.  The Short-Term IDR has been affirmed at 'F2'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.  McDonald's has approximately $26 billion of total debt.  The downgrade reflects Fitch's expectation that total adjusted debt/EBITDAR will  be sustained in the mid-to-high 3.0x range through 2018, with EBITDA stabilizing  around the current level. LTM EBITDA at Sept. 30, 2016 was $9.4 billion. Given  McDonald's aggressive financial strategy, debt reduction is not anticipated.  Furthermore, while U.S. comps have improved since the fall of 2015, due in part  to better store-level execution and the launch of All-Day Breakfast, Fitch does  not view recent performance as sustainable. According to Bloomberg data provided  by Euromonitor International, McDonald's has gradually lost share to improving  quick-service competitors and fast-casual operators in the U.S. limited service  restaurant industry since 2012. Fitch believes McDonald's will continue to lose  share over the medium term, although quarterly volatility in share trends is  anticipated, due to heightened competition and changing consumer preferences.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Leverage Expected to Remain Elevated  McDonald's debt balance increased to $26 billion at Sept. 30, 2016 from roughly  $15 billion at the end of 2014 due to the company's three-year $30 billion  shareholder cash return plan which is expected to be completed by the end of  2016. For the LTM period ended Sept. 30, 2016, total adjusted debt/EBITDAR was  approximately 3.6x. Fitch projects leverage in the mid-to-high 3.0x range with  EBITDA stabilizing around $9.4 billion through 2018. Free cash flow (FCF;  defined as cash flow from operations less capex less dividends) is projected to  approximate $1 billion annually through 2018 and is expected to be deployed  towards share repurchases.  U.S. Trends Soften, Share Losses Expected to Continue The U.S. represented 39% of McDonald's 36,525 restaurants, 34% of its $25.4  billion of revenue and 51% of its $7.1 billion of operating income in 2015.  Fitch is concerned about McDonald's share trends in the U.S. given softening  performance and the recent narrowing of the company's comp gap versus the  broader U.S. quick-service restaurant sandwich category. For the quarter ended  Sept. 30, 2016, U.S. comps rose 1.3% as 3.5% pricing offset negative guest  counts. Per McDonald's, its comp gap to the category narrowed to 0.6% last  quarter from 2.9% in the fourth quarter of 2015. Fitch anticipates the positive  September quarter comp gap was due to pricing, which according to McDonald's  exceeded the industry by about 1%. Fitch attributes McDonald's softening U.S. comps to higher pricing that led to  declines in guest counts, a recent slowdown in the broader industry, heightened  competition, and growing consumer preference for freshly prepared food at a good  value. McDonald's typically increases prices in line with food-away-from  inflation but the company's price increases have exceeded the industry over the  past three quarters. Given that value continues to drive traffic and the need  for operators to remain competitively priced, Fitch anticipates that McDonald's  will price more in line with the market in 2017. The USDA is forecasting  food-away-from-home inflation of 2% - 3% in 2017, versus 2.5% - 3.5% this year. McDonald's is responding to changing consumer preferences by emphasizing food  quality. The company is also emphasizing value with its McPick2 platform and  investing in the McDonald's Experience of the Future to enhance the customer  experience. However, Fitch believes McDonald's will continue to gradually lose  share over the medium term in the U.S. due to increased choices for consumers,  stemming from the growth of specialty burger shops like Shake Shack and Five  Guys, and some weakening in McDonald's brand perception within the hamburger  category and among younger and health-conscious consumers in recent years.  International Comp Trends Providing Offset Comp trends in McDonald's international markets have exceeded those in the U.S.  During the quarter ended Sept. 30, 2016, comps in the company's foundational,  international lead, and high-growth markets rose 10.1%, 3.3%, and 1.5%,  respectively. Strong performance in the U.K, Australia, and Canada, a recovery  in Japan and China following supplier food safety issues in 2014, and  locally-relevant value offerings contributed to this growth. Fitch projects  McDonald's global comps will decelerate to around 2% in 2017 and 2018, after  rising a projected 3.5% in 2016. International markets are expected to continue  to outperform the U.S. where Fitch expects less pricing and potentially weaker  guest count trends. Refranchising and Potential Asset Sale  McDonald's is on track with its goal of increasing its mix of franchised units  from 81% in 2014 to 93% by the end of 2018 and 95% longer-term. Since the start  of 2015, the company has refranchised nearly 1,000 of the 4,000 company-operated  units targeted. Moreover, McDonald's recently disclosed that it is actively  pursuing a transaction in China and is making progress in its search for  strategic partners in Malaysia and Singapore. McDonald's operated roughly 2,200  units in China and nearly 400 in Malaysia and Singapore combined in 2015.  McDonald's shift towards a higher mix of franchised units is consistent with  industry trends. In 2015, 35% or $8.9 billion of McDonald's $25.4 billion of  revenue was from franchising. The margin from franchising was 81.5% versus a  margin of 15.2% from operating restaurants. Fitch projects more than 50% of  McDonald's revenue will be from franchising by 2018, which will increase  stability of cash flow due to a steady stream of royalty and rental income.  McDonald's is also exploring the sale of a portion of its 50% ownership in  McDonald's Holdings Co. Ltd (McDonald's Japan) which operated 2,956 units at the  end of 2015 under an affiliate structure. Based on the entity's approximately  400 billion Japanese Yen ($3.8 billion) market capitalization, McDonald's stake  is worth nearly $2 billion. Fitch anticipates cash proceeds from this  transaction and refranchising could total over $4 billion and will be returned  to shareholders. G&A Cost Reductions to Continue Through 2017 McDonald's is targeting $500 million of annualized G&A cost reductions with the  vast majority being realized by the end of 2017. The goal represents nearly 20%  of McDonald's $2.6 billion expense base at the beginning of 2015. Savings will  be realized through refranchising, lower corporate overhead, and greater  efficiencies across global business services. The company expects to realize  $150 million of savings, excluding increased incentive compensation, by the end  of 2016. Fitch expects these savings along with increased franchise royalty and  rental-based income to offset operating income declines associated with  refranchising.  KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for McDonald's include:  --Revenue approximates $24.7 billion in 2016 and declines to below $20 billion  by 2018 due to refranchising; --Global SSS growth approximates 3.5% in 2016 and 2% in 2017 and 2018 due to 2%  - 3% pricing and flat to slightly negative guest counts; --Operating income grows 7% to $8 billion in 2016, is relatively flat through  2018 due to G&A cost reductions and expense management; --Total debt is sustained around $26 billion through 2018;  --FCF approximates $1 billion annually in 2017 and 2018; --Total adjusted debt-to-operating EBITDAR is in the mid-to-high 3x range  through 2018. RATING SENSITIVITIES Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a positive  rating action include:  --Total adjusted debt-to-operating EBITDAR sustained in the low-3x range;  --Global comps consistently above 2% along with the maintenance of market share  in the U.S. Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a negative  rating action include:  --Total adjusted debt-to-operating EBITDAR near 4x due to material declines in  operating income or increased debt;  --A year or more of negative global comps and greater than expected loss of  market share in the U.S.  LIQUIDITY McDonald's liquidity is supported by its FCF, cash balance, and a $2.5 billion  revolving credit facility that expires December 2019. As of Sept. 30, 2016,  liquidity totalled $4.8 billion and consisted of $2.3 billion of cash and $2.5  billion revolver availability. Debt maturities are estimated at $1.6 billion in  2017, $1.8 billion in 2018, and $1.5 billion in 2019. Fitch expects maturities  to be refinanced, as debt paydown is not anticipated. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has downgraded the following ratings:  --Long-Term IDR to 'BBB' from 'BBB+'; --Bank credit facilities to 'BBB' from 'BBB+'; --Senior unsecured debt to 'BBB' from 'BBB+'. The following ratings have been affirmed:  --Short-Term IDR at 'F2'; --Commercial paper at 'F2'.  The Rating Outlook is Stable.

697,"   By Chris Prentice and Lisa Baertlein | NEW YORK/LOS ANGELES  NEW YORK/LOS ANGELESMcDonald's, aiming to become more modern and nimble, is updating U.S. restaurants with self-service kiosk ordering, mobile payments, ""smart"" menu boards, custom sandwiches and table service, executives said on Thursday.The 61-year-old fast-food company has been overhauling its food with simpler ingredients and selling breakfast items 24-hours a day, but it is playing catch up in the technology realm to early adopters such as Domino's Pizza, Starbucks Corp and Panera Bread.About 500 of McDonald's more than 14,000 U.S. restaurants have made the changes with Florida, New York and Southern California the first regions to adopt the new format.Restaurants in San Francisco, Boston, Chicago and Seattle will start making the switch next year, according to the company, which declined to give a timeline for how long the changes will take to go nationwide.McDonald's will pilot mobile ordering in the United States in the first half of 2017 and do a national rollout in the second half, Chris Kempczinski, a former Kraft Foods executive who will take over as McDonald's USA president on Jan. 1, told journalists at a press event in New York. Mobile ordering and payment will be added to the McDonald's app, which has been downloaded by 16 million people, he said.Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook said the company was in the early stage of using technology. ""There is nothing more powerful than one-on-one customer experience"" such as smartphone apps, he said to Reuters. Still, some of McDonald's U.S. franchisees have chafed at the prospect of making significant investments at a time when labor costs are rising and restaurant sales growth is tepid. Analysts note that just 50 percent of U.S. McDonald's restaurants have been recently renovated, and the company wants new food and tech elements in addition to the restaurant makeovers.The cost of installing kiosks is between $50,000 and $60,000 and the company is willing to help with money or financing, McDonald's executives said. Eastbrook has said that equipment is not expected to reduce the number of workers in restaurants, since traditional order takers would be redeployed to help customers learn to operate kiosks and to deliver food to tables.  Demonstrating returns is key to convincing franchisees to make the switch, executives said. In a video, one UK executive said sales grew 8 percent in downtown London as a result of the initiative. ""People may not always like to change, but people like to make money,"" Kempczinski told Reuters.McDonald's USA draws on results from modernization projects in the United Kingdom, Australia and Canada as it pushes the effort. ""We've worked a lot of the kinks out,"" Easterbrook told Reuters.  Kempczinski said McDonald's may also pick up the pace of its response to consumer demands for simpler, more natural food. McDonald's USA already has switched to chicken raised without antibiotics important to human health, replaced margarine with butter in its Egg McMuffins, and swapped sugar for high-fructose corn syrup in its hamburger buns.Most recently, it said it would fully transition to cage-free eggs in the United States and Canada over the next decade.

702,"   By Robert Iafolla  McDonald's Corp has asked a federal judge to throw out a proposed class action filed by workers at a California franchise, arguing that it cannot be held liable for state law violations just because workers believed the company rather than the local franchisee was their employer. In a brief filed Friday, McDonald's, represented by Jones Day, tried to convince a federal judge for a second time to stop a lawsuit from proceeding under a theory of ostensible agency, a California common law doctrine that says a company can be held liable for labor law violations if workers reasonably believed it was their employer. The laws that the plaintiffs sued under, however, McDonald's argued, limit liability to those that have control over working conditions.

703,"   By Beh Lih Yi  KUALA LUMPUR (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Fast food giant McDonald's said it has dropped a labor supply agency in Malaysia after claims emerged that it was underpaying its migrant workers and housing them in appalling conditions.An investigation by British newspaper the Guardian said the agency supplying workers to McDonald's was withholding their salaries, which were as low as 75 U.S. cents an hour, underpaying promised wages, and confiscating their passports.The report was based on interviews with 15 Nepali workers who had worked at different McDonald's restaurants in the capital Kuala Lumpur.McDonald's said it has ended its contract with the agency,  Human Connection HR, and pledged staff welfare is a ""top priority"", with companies globally under mounting pressure to ensure their supply chains are free of slavery and exploitation.""Earlier this year, we became aware of certain circumstances relating to services provided by Human Connection HR which were not in compliance with our standards,"" spokesman Ron Christianson said in a statement.""As a result, we have terminated our contract with them."" There was no suggestion of any wrongdoing by McDonald's. Human Connection HR said it will hold a meeting and issue a response soon. Christianson would not confirm details of the exploitation, saying the workers were employees of the labor agency.""Because the workers are not employees of McDonald's, our efforts to address the issues were unsuccessful, as were proposals for McDonald's to assume responsibility for paying workers directly,"" he said.Human Connection HR had been supplying workers to McDonald's in Malaysia for ""a number of years"", Christianson added. He said the company's suppliers were bound to uphold a code of conduct which includes safeguarding worker's rights.McDonald's hires over 12,000 people in Malaysia, and less than 5 percent are foreign workers.Malaysia, which is Southeast Asia's third-largest economy,  relies heavily on foreign workers especially in construction, plantation and domestic work, but human rights campaigners have long voiced concerns that they face widespread abuses. Aegile Fernandez, director at Kuala Lumpur-based migrant rights group Tenaganita, said labor exploitation happens ""almost everyday"" among multinational firms in the country.She urged McDonald's to take responsibility and ensure its supply chain is free of exploitation and slavery.""They can't run away because they are the main company,"" she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.""No matter if you're in the United States or Europe, you have to ensure your suppliers are following all the regulations and upholding the rights of the workers.""

Jim, we thank and will forever remember you"", the company said.U.S. media reported that Delligatti died at his Pennsylvania home on Monday. In a 2007 interview with Reuters, Delligatti said it took two years to convince McDonald's that the Big Mac was a good idea.""I felt that we needed a big sandwich,"" he said. ""But you couldn't do anything unless they gave you permission."" The contents of the sandwich, immortalized by the popular jingle ""two-all-beef-patties-special-sauce-lettuce-cheese-pickles-onions-on-a-sesame-seed-bun"" are generally the same worldwide, although prices and nutrition value varies.The U.S. version of the Big Mac contains about 540 calories, 28 grams of fat and 25 grams of protein, according to the McDonald's website.

The company hired Morgan Stanley (MS.N) to run the sale of about 2,400 restaurants in China and Hong Kong.

The company will also keep for now its stores in South Korea, which it previously also wanted to sell, the person added.A McDonald's spokeswoman in Shanghai declined to comment. Carlyle declined to comment and CITIC did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. McDonald's in March said it was reorganizing operations in the region, looking for strategic partners in China, Hong Kong and South Korea as it switches to a less capital-intensive franchise model.McDonald's owns most of its more than 2,800 restaurants in the three markets. It is offering a 20-year franchise to buyers with a 10-year extension option. The Chinese and Hong Kong stores attracted bids from a variety of parties, including TPG Capital Management LP [TPG.UL] - which teamed up with mini-market operator Wumart Stores Inc - and real estate firm Sanpower Group Co Ltd [SPGCL.UL], which owns British department store House of Fraser Ltd [HFPLC.UL], Reuters previously reported.The sale comes at time when fast-food operators including McDonald's and Yum Brands Inc (YUM.N) are recovering from a series of food-supply scandals in China that have undermined their performance. Yum, best known for the KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell brands, agreed to sell a $460 million stake in its China unit to investment firm Primavera Capital and an affiliate of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N) ahead of a planned spin-off of the business.

708,"   By Quentin Webb | HONG KONG  HONG KONG China will still be on the menu for McDonald's. The $100 billion U.S. burger giant is poised to sell its outlets in mainland China and Hong Kong for up to $2 billion. Seeing this as a simple retreat from the Middle Kingdom is tempting, but wrong. As elsewhere, franchising is a better business than owning and operating stores. There are other benefits to having a Chinese partner too.The Oak Brook, Illinois company has picked private equity firm Carlyle and local outfit CITIC Group as buyers, according to Reuters. While the mooted price tag is lower than earlier talk of a $3 billion price, that's because McDonald's is keeping a 25 percent interest. Higher than average royalty fees by the American parent may also cut the upfront proceeds too. The stake retention looks like classic ""shmuck insurance"" – keeping a slice to avoid seller's remorse if things go better than expected. It could also help McDonald's keep a closer quality control eye over an important part of its global empire. China has been tricky for U.S. players, who have faced slowing growth, food scares, emerging local competitors and anti-American protests. For Yum Brands, whose network of KFC and Pizza Huts in China is three times larger than McDonald's there, the answer was to spin Yum China off to shareholders.  But Chinese earnings will still matter to both parent companies, and both local arms will keep expanding at breakneck pace. McDonald's has about 2,400 Chinese outlets, and will add 250 a year. The coffee world is equally enamoured of the Chinese consumer: Starbucks is opening a store every day on the mainland. For McDonald's, the sale moves it closer to Chief Executive Stephen Easterbrook's goal of having the vast majority of its restaurants operated by franchisees. That's a more attractive business model, but franchising has only in recent years become straightforward in China. Having a local ally in CITIC, China's oldest financial conglomerate, could also help McDonald's better understand local tastes and handle future difficulties. Yum China also brought in local partners. It is easier to bash a wholly American company than it is to bash one backed by the local establishment.",2016-12-08,MCD,"Thu Dec 8, 2016 | 4:19am EST",China is still firmly on the menu for McDonald's,http://www.reuters.com//article/uk-mcdonalds-m-a-breakingviews-idUSKBN13X0TV?type=companyNews
709,"   (Story corrects paragraph 10 to replace U.S. drugmaker Allegion with U.S. lock maker Allegion)McDonald's Corp (MCD.N) said on Thursday it would move its international tax base to the United Kingdom from Luxembourg after coming under increased scrutiny from European Union regulators over its tax arrangements in the small country.McDonald's said it would create a new international holding company domiciled in the UK that would receive the majority of  royalties from licensing deals outside the United States.""We are aligning our corporate structure with the way we do business, which is no longer in geographies, but in segments that group together countries with common market and growth characteristics,"" McDonald's said in a statement.The move will also help to cut costs, McDonald's said.The reorganization comes amid an investigation by the EU into what it says are sweetheart tax deals that smaller states in the bloc offer to multinational companies to lure jobs and investment.In August, the EU ordered Apple Inc (AAPL.O) to pay Ireland unpaid taxes of up to 13 billion euros ($13.8 billion), ruling that the iPhone maker had received illegal state aid. McDonald's potentially faced an order from the bloc to pay back taxes of $500 million to Luxembourg, the Financial Times reported in September. The company said in July it would create over 5,000 jobs in Britain by the end of 2017, in a sign of its commitment to the country after the vote on June 23 to leave the EU.A number of international companies have shifted their corporate registration or primary tax residence to the UK since Britain relaxed its rules on the taxation of companies' foreign subsidiaries in 2012. These include U.S. lock maker Allegion (ALLE.N), U.S. insurer Aon (AON.N) and Italian tractor maker CNH Industrial (CNHI.MI).Under UK rules, profits earned by overseas arms or a UK-registered company are effectively exempt from UK tax even if the income is untaxed.Tax campaigners say this allows companies shift profits out of the UK before being taxed and then allows companies bring the money back tax free. The moves studied by Reuters create few if any jobs and have helped the companies slash their tax bills. reut.rs/2gozu2EMcDonald's shares were up 0.6 percent at $120.63 at midday.
