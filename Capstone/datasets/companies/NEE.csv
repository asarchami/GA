0,"  Jan 15 California energy regulators said on Wednesday they approved NextEra Energy Inc's plan to use a different technology at its proposed $1.13 billion Blythe solar power plant, moving the 485-megawatt project a step closer to construction.In a 5-0 vote, the Energy Commission agreed to allow NextEra to switch to solar photovoltaic technology from the previously approved solar parabolic-trough system.""The project will spur California's transition to renewable energy and help advance its aggressive climate change goals,"" Commissioner Karen Douglas, the presiding member of the committee reviewing the Blythe project, said in a statement.NextEra spokesman Steve Stengel said in an email the company is still seeking approvals for the project from the U.S. Bureau of Land Management and is still looking for a company to buy the power from the proposed project. NextEra wants to build the project on federal public land controlled by the Bureau of Land Management.In December, the committee reviewing Blythe found the project may have ""environmental impacts that are cumulatively significant when considered along with the impacts of other projects in the region.""But the committee found the project's expected benefits - including a contribution to meeting California's Renewables Portfolio Standard, reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, the creation of nearly 500 peak construction jobs, and a boost to the economy -- justify an override of those environmental impacts. In September 2010, the Energy Commission approved the 1,000-MW Blythe solar project for a site located about eight miles (13 km) west of Blythe in eastern Riverside County on 7,043 acres (2,850 hectares) of federal public land.One megawatt can power about 1,000 homes. Solar Millennium, which went bankrupt at the end of 2011, filed an amendment with the commission in June 2012 to switch the project to solar photovoltaic technology.In April 2013, the project owner, NextEra, filed a revised amendment to reduce the project's physical size and generation capacity.NextEra's amended 485-MW project would be developed on 4,070 acres of land in four phases, with the first three consisting of 125 MW and the fourth generating 110 MW.Construction on the project is expected to last 48 months.

2,"  MADRID May 26 U.S. alternative energy group NextEra has filed a complaint against Spain before the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) over changes to renewable energy rules, the fourth complaint of its kind.The Spanish government has passed a series of measures over the past two years that cut and, in some cases, eliminate subsidies on renewable energy assets as part of reforms that many investors say change the original terms of their contracts.Three other foreign investors have also filed complaints against the changes with the ICSID, a member of the World Bank Group, which facilitates arbitration of legal disputes in international investment cases. The complaint by NextEra, posted on the ICSID website, was filed on May 23. Spain's new energy laws are aimed at mending years of policy that created a gap in regulated prices and costs, leading to a 30 billion euro ($41 billion) electricity tariff deficit.

3,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, June 04 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A-' rating to NextEra  Energy Capital Holdings' (Capital Holdings) $350 million 2.40% senior unsecured  debentures due Sept. 15, 2019. The current Issuer Default Rating (IDR) for  Capital Holdings and for its parent, NextEra Energy, Inc. (NEE), is 'A-', and  the Rating Outlook for both entities is Stable. NEE provides full guarantee of  Capital Holdings' debt and hybrids. The debentures are absolutely, irrevocably and unconditionally guaranteed by  NEE. The guarantee is an unsecured obligation of NEE and will rank equally and  ratably with all other unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of NEE. The net  proceeds from this offering will be added to Capital Holdings' general funds,  which will be used to repay a portion of total outstanding commercial paper (CP)  obligations and for other general corporate purposes. As of March 5, 2014,  Capital Holdings had outstanding commercial paper obligations of $1.435 billion.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Changing Business Mix To More Regulated/Contracted: NEE's continued shift away  from merchant businesses toward regulated investments and contracted  non-regulated renewable assets is supportive of its credit profile. Driving the  favorable shift in cash flow mix are factors such as base rate increases at  NEE's regulated utility subsidiary, Florida Power & Light (FPL), a recovering  Florida economy, completion of the regulated Lone Star transmission line in  2013, the rising contribution from contracted solar and wind investments, and  proposed investment in regulated natural gas transmission. In addition, absent a  significant recovery in the commodity environment, which Fitch is not expecting,  the contribution from non-contracted generation assets and other non-regulated  businesses will remain contained, in Fitch's opinion. Fitch forecasts that  regulated businesses will contribute between 60%-65% of NEE's EBITDA for the  next several years. Within the non-regulated businesses, management's emphasis remains on long-term  contracted renewable generation, specifically solar and wind. Fitch expects the  long-term contracted business to drive up to 63% of 2016 forecasted EBITDA for  Energy Resources, which is higher than 56% contribution in 2013 and  significantly above the 49% contribution in 2009. Fitch expects contractual  sources to continue to drive another 20% of NEE's consolidated EBITDA over the  next few years.  High Capex: Aided by yet another extension in Production Tax Credits (PTCs),  NEE's renewable portfolio continues to grow under Capital Holdings' wholly owned  subsidiary, NextEra Energy Resources (Energy Resources). Management expects to  develop 2,000-2,500 megawatts (MW) of new wind projects over 2013-2015, of which  1,672 MW have been committed and have long-term signed power purchase agreements  (PPAs). Management is also targeting approximately 1,100 MWs of solar projects  over 2013-2016, all of which has been contracted. Capital Holdings is also  increasing its regulated portfolio through investments in Federal Energy  Regulatory Commission (FERC) regulated gas pipelines. Fitch has assumed all  these projects come to fruition and have included them in its financial  projections but have not included any incremental capex opportunities.  The capex at FPL over 2014-2016 is being driven by the recently completed plant  modernization at Riviera Beach and the ongoing plant modernizations at Port  Everglades and other infrastructure improvements such as storm hardening and  reliability investments. The plant modernization projects have been approved by  the Florida Public Service Commission and, once completed, will earn a return  through the generation base-rate adjustment (GBRA) mechanism. As a result of  continued investments at both Capital Holdings and FPL, capex at NEE will  continue to be elevated throughout Fitch's forecast period of 2014-2016 (average  of $6.6 billion), albeit lower than the $9.5 billion peak reached in 2012. It is  highly likely that there is further upside to these capex estimates,  particularly for Capital Holdings, since any legislative extension of tax  benefits for wind and solar will be a further impetus for NEE to expand its  renewable portfolio.  Demonstrated Equity Support: Given the pressures on credit metrics today and  elevated levels of forecasted capex, management's emphasis on strengthening the  balance sheet is warranted to maintain the current levels of ratings. In this  regard, the company's equity issuance of $1.5 billion in 2013 in the form of  $400 million of common equity issued in November 2013, $600 million of equity  forward contract to be settled by the end of 2014, and $500 million of equity  units issued in September 2013, is positive for NEE's credit.  Formation Of A Growth-Oriented Limited Partnership: NEE recently announced its  decision to form Nextera Energy Partners, LP (NEP), which will be a publically  listed, yield driven growth oriented vehicle. NEP will initially own a portfolio  of 10 wind and solar assets with a generating capacity of 990 MW. NEE has  committed to provide a right of first offer (ROFO) to NEP over a six-year period  for additional 1,549 MW of wind and solar assets. NEE intends to sell-down a  portion of its ownership in NEP to public through an IPO and will own a general  partner interest in NEP through an affiliate. At present, Fitch views the formation of NEP as neutral to NEE's credit. The  small size of NEP and contemplated pace of sell-downs does not alter the  business mix of Energy Resources or NEE in any meaningful way. Fitch expects NEE  to use a portion of the sale proceeds for holding company debt reduction.  Management in its public comments has reinforced its commitment to credit  ratings and Fitch expects NEE to meet the targeted credit metrics on a pro forma  basis. As NEP grows larger and if NEE's ownership is progressively reduced,  Fitch could take a more conservative view of evaluating the cash distributions  from NEP relative to other sources of funds to service holding company debt.  Please refer to Fitch's release ""Fitch Views NEP Formation as Neutral to  Nextera's Ratings"" dated May 28, 2014, available at www.fitchratings.com, for  additional commentary on NEP and its implication for NEE's credit profile. Treatment Of Non-recourse Debt: NEE's credit metrics, as reported, show more  leverage than a median 'A-' financial profile for a utility or parent holding  company. A large portion of Energy Resources' generation portfolio is project  financed with debt that has limited or no corporate recourse. These projects,  however, tend to be highly leveraged (with typically a low investment grade  profile), which weakens the consolidated leverage metrics for NEE. In Fitch's  view, a better way to analyze NEE's metrics is to deconsolidate a majority of  the project financed entities and only include the upstream distribution from  these entities in NEE's credit analysis. The off-credit treatment to the limited  recourse debt at Energy Resources reflects Fitch's assumption that NEE would  walk away from these projects in the event of financial deterioration, including  those projects where a differential membership interest has been sold. These  projects typically comprise wind, solar as well as fossil assets. Non-recourse  debt associated with entities such as Lone Star Transmission is not  deconsolidated.  Weak But Strengthening Credit Measures: On a fully consolidated GAAP basis,  Fitch expects NEE's funds from operations (FFO) fixed-charge coverage to be  approximately 5.00x-5.25x over the forecast period of 2014-2016. FFO adjusted  leverage and adjusted debt/EBITDAR are expected to improve to 3.7x by 2016 from  year-end 2013 levels of 4.2x and 4.7x, respectively. NEE's FFO based metrics are  robust reflecting the beneficial cash tax position of the company and aligned  with an 'A-' rated financial profile for the sector. The biggest risk to Fitch  forecasts is the extent of tax equity used by Energy Resources to build its  renewable pipeline. Lower than expected tax equity proceeds for Energy Resources  due to a limited tax equity appetite among market participants in the future  will increase the reliance on project debt, thereby, putting pressure on the  consolidated GAAP financials. Extension of PTCs is another wild card since it  would spur a higher renewable development and likely lead to higher than  anticipated debt financing.  Fitch also looked at an alternative rating scenario, which incorporates  off-credit treatment to a large portion of limited recourse debt at Energy  Resources. Fitch accordingly excludes the debt, interest expense, EBITDA  contribution and tax attributes from such projects and includes only the  distributable cash flow. Adjusting for non-recourse debt, NEE's credit metrics  look stronger. FFO fixed-charge cover remains above 6.5x over the forecast  period. FFO adjusted leverage and adjusted debt/EBITDAR are both expected to  improve to 3.2x by 2016 under this scenario.  Strong Liquidity And Capital Access: NEE's ratings also reflect the company's  strong access to the capital markets, CP market and to banks for both corporate  credit and project finance. Liquidity is robust with committed corporate credit  facilities of the NEE group of companies aggregating approximately $8.8 billion,  excluding limited recourse or non-recourse project financing arrangements. Debt  maturities are manageable.  RATING SENSITIVITIES  Positive rating actions for NEE and Capital Holdings appear unlikely at this  time. Downward rating pressure could result from:  Inability to Reach Targeted Credit Metrics: A failure to achieve adjusted FFO  leverage between 3.75x - 4.0x by 2016 on a consolidated basis could lead to  negative rating action for NEE.  Deterioration in Florida Regulation: Any change in current regulatory policies  at Florida Public Service Commission would adversely affect NEE's and FPL's  ratings. Any weakness in the current business climate in Florida will also be a  cause for concern.  Increase In Business Risk Profile: A change in strategy to invest in more  speculative assets, non-contracted renewable assets or a lower proportion of  cash flow under long-term contracts would increase business risk and could  result in lower ratings for NEE. The high level of capital expenditures at both  FPL and Capital Holdings creates completion risks, as well as funding risk.  Aggressive Financial Strategy: Any deterioration in credit measures that result  from higher use of leverage or outsized return of capital to shareholders could  lead to negative rating actions. Fitch will continue to monitor management's  strategy with respect to NEP and an aggressive acquisition or financial  strategy, rising conflict of interest between NEE and NEP, or predominantly  shareholder focused use of sell down proceeds will have negative implications  for NEE's credit.  Change In Tax Laws or Regulations: Changes in tax rules that reduce NEE's  ability to monetize its accumulated production tax credits, investment tax  credits, and accumulated tax losses carried forward would be adverse to NEE's  cash flow credit measures.

4,"  (Adds details of both proposals)By Tom HalsJune 24 Energy Future Holdings rejected an unsolicited $2.3 billion restructuring plan by NextEra Energy Inc that would have given the alternative energy group a large stake in Energy Future's power lines unit, according to court filings.The proposal, which was revealed in court filings late Monday, was developed by NextEra and a group of investors that hold second-lien notes issued by Energy Future's EFIH unit, which in turn controls the Oncor power distribution business.EFIH, or Energy Future Intermediate Holding, rejected the proposal in favor of a plan already advanced by a group of investors who hold the unit's unsecured bonds, according to filings with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Delaware.Both proposals take the form of a loan to refinance EFIH's high-yielding second-lien notes, which would cut interest costs. Rather than repay the loan, when EFIH emerges from bankruptcy the financing would convert into an equity stake of a little more than 60 percent of the company. Shares of NextEra, the largest U.S. generator of renewable energy, closed up 1.1 percent at $100.73, near a 52-week high, on the New York Stock Exchange. The company is based in Juno Beach, Florida and a company spokeswoman said NextEra does not comment on potential transactions.Court filings reveal a flurry of last-minute changes to the two loan proposals as each group jockeyed to win over a meeting of the board of managers of EFIH on Sunday. In its final proposal, NextEra planned to contribute $1.6 billion to the package, according to court filings.Backers of the proposed NextEra loan said in court papers their proposal carried a lower interest rate, offered more money to unsecured creditors and would pay second-lien noteholders an early redemption payment, ending litigation on the issue.The company's board opted on Sunday to stick with the loan proposed by its unsecured bondholders, in part because the NextEra loan did allow the company to pursue other deals, according to court filings. NextEra and its second-lien noteholder partners could still get their loan approved. They asked Judge Christopher Sontchi to reject the unsecured creditors loan proposal when he hears the issue on June 30.Energy Future filed one of the largest U.S. bankruptcies in April and seeks to restructure more than $40 billion in debt as it was squeezed by falling natural gas prices.Energy Future also plans to spin off the unit that owns the TXU Energy retail utility and the power generating business known as Luminant to holders of $24.4 billion in secured debt.

10,"   By Nichola Groom  NextEra Energy Inc's (NEE.N) $4.3 billion plan to buy Hawaiian Electric Industries Inc (HE.N) has made solar companies uneasy, worried that the deal would reverse the island state's push to decentralize its power grid.In documents filed with Hawaii's utility regulator, SunPower Corp (SPWR.O), SunEdison Inc SUNE.N and a group backed by SolarCity SCTY.O say they are worried the acquisition would be bad for their businesses, many of which have grown dramatically in the Aloha State in just a few years. The deal, announced in December, needs Public Utilities Commission approval.Hawaii, with its sunny weather and sky-high electricity rates, is one of the world's best markets for solar power. Residents see solar as a solution to weaning the state off its reliance on pricey imported fuel oil. The percentage of rooftop solar installations on homes in Hawaii far surpasses that of any other state, so it is widely considered the Petri dish for integrating large amounts of so-called distributed generation. ""A decision on this merger could be a signal of what utility 2.0 looks like,"" Robert Harris, a Hawaii-based spokesman for The Alliance for Solar Choice, said in an interview. The group represents rooftop solar companies SolarCity, SunRun, Demeter Power, Solar Universe and Verengo Solar.In the filings, the companies express concern about NextEra's track record of favoring large centralized renewable energy plants over rooftop solar and worry that the deal will hurt competition. ""It raises the question of whether NextEra plans to have all the renewable energy provided by its subsidiary NextEra Resources,"" Sunpower said in its Feb. 18 filing, adding that it believed this would deny ""other renewable energy companies a fair opportunity to compete in the Hawaii market."" The company said it had spent millions of dollars on building its business in Hawaii over the last 16 years. SunPower is majority owned by France's Total (TOTF.PA).NextEra, which owns about 850 megawatts of solar and 11,500 MW of wind in the United States and Canada, said the concerns are unwarranted. The company's regulated utility, Florida Power & Light, has just a few thousand rooftop solar systems because the state's very low electricity prices make it more difficult for solar to compete with power from the grid.

14,"   By Tom Hals  NextEra Energy Inc said on Wednesday it was prepared to buy Energy Future Holdings Corp's distribution business, the bankrupt power company's crown jewel, potentially disrupting an agreed deal led by Hunt Consolidated.Energy Future Holdings, or EFH, is in the midst of a weeks-long trial to confirm its plan of reorganization, which is built around a sale of the power distribution business, known as Oncor, to creditors and Hunt. That deal has been valued at around $19 billion.""NextEra is currently prepared to consummate an alternative transaction,"" the Juno Beach, Florida-based company said Wednesday in a filing with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Delaware. ""NextEra's alternative transaction is the only proposal that can provide several significant benefits to Oncor, its customers, its creditors and EFH.""A spokesman for EFH declined to comment. The Hunt plan is built around the expectation that Oncor can be converted into a real estate investment trust, which would create value by lowering potential taxes. Dallas-based EFH also plans to spin off power plants and its retail electric utility business to creditors, although there is a risk those spin-offs could trigger a big tax bill. If U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Christopher Sontchi approves EFH's plan, the Hunt deal still faces several regulatory hurdles that opposing creditors say raise the risk Hunt could walk away.NextEra said its plan has a higher chance of success thanks in part to a strong balance sheet.

19,"   By Swetha Gopinath  Nov 20 SunEdison Inc's decision to halt sales of solar power plants to its dividend-paying ""yieldco"" units has drawn attention to the company's missteps at a time when the oil price slump has claimed renewable energy stocks as collateral damage.So-called yieldcos are publicly traded entities that house solar and wind projects sold to them by their parent companies.These units have long-term agreements to sell power, giving them stable cash flows, but they are dependent on the transfer of assets from their parents to increase dividends.Yieldcos are supposed to be safe bets for people looking to invest in the volatile solar market, which is why SunEdison's decision has prompted a selloff in its stock and raised fresh questions about the viability of the yieldco model.Some analysts and investors think SunEdison lost the plot as it tried to grow too quickly through acquisitions it couldn't afford, leaving it with little choice but to sell assets to third parties for higher prices rather than to its own units.So, they say, it's unlikely rivals will follow SunEdison's lead and halt sales to their asset-holding businesses.SunEdison, run out of Belmont, California, has lost two-thirds of its value since it said on Oct. 7 that it would halt so-called ""asset drop downs"". The company's stock hit a three-year low of $2.55 on Friday.""It's more a reflection of SunEdison's strategy than the yieldco structure,"" said Hood River Capital portfolio manager Brian Smoluch. ""I wouldn't throw out the whole asset class.""SunEdison's total debt of $11.67 billion is more than 10 times its market capitalization of about $900 million, according to Thomson Reuters data. Renewable energy companies such as SunPower Corp  and Transalta Corp have reassured investors that their plans to sell assets to their yieldcos remain intact.In fact, a drop in prices of yieldco stocks have opened up buying opportunities, investors say.Yieldcos of companies such as NRG Energy Inc and NextEra Energy Inc are good bets because the parents hold many assets that can be dropped down, they said.Prices for all yieldcos have fallen sharply this year, caught up in a selloff caused by weak oil prices.Up to Thursday's close, SunEdison's yieldcos - TerraForm Global Inc and TerraForm Power Inc - had lost about two-thirds of their value. NRG Yield Inc shares have dropped about 39 percent, while Nextera Energy Partners LP's have fallen about 23 percent.""All yieldcos are not created equal,"" said Rob Thummel, portfolio manager at Tortoise Capital Advisors LLC, adding that the yieldco structure remained the best way to play rising demand for solar and wind energy.SHOULD HAVE BEEN BORING Yieldcos have to be seen as stable income-producing investments like REITs, many involved in the industry say. ""Yieldcos should have been built as boring, fixed-income instruments,"" said Ted Brandt, chief executive of investment banking firm Marathon Capital LLC.""But Wall Street couldn't do that, they ended up ... packaging them as growth instruments,"" said Brandt, whose firm advises energy and infrastructure companies.Still, for some SuneEdison's situation has strengthened the case against the yieldco model.Critics say many yieldcos overpay for assets, and don't like the fact that they need to continually raise money to buy projects in order to boost dividends.""We don't really like the business models of U.S. yieldcos ... their acquisition appetite for projects is often bigger than the market opportunity,"" said David Richardson, managing director at investment firm Impax Asset Management.JinkoSolar Holding Co Ltd, which has been looking to list a yieldco, said on Thursday that the U.S. market was not ""favorable"" to solar yieldcos now.The MAC Global Solar Energy Index has fallen nearly 30 percent this year.Some also draw a comparison between yieldcos and Master Limited Partnerships, set up to hold their parents' oil and gas pipelines.MLPs were all the rage a few years ago, but have since fallen out of favor for the same reason that has hurt yieldcos - a slump in oil prices that hit dividend growth.

23,"   By Jessica DiNapoli | NEW YORK, July 14  NEW YORK, July 14 Fidelity Investments is working on preparing a bid with other creditors of Energy Future Holdings Corp to acquire through Energy Future's bankruptcy the company's crown jewel, Oncor, according to people familiar with the matter.Energy Future has been in bankruptcy for over two years. Plans for Oncor, a utility serving Texas that is prized for its steady cash flow, have come together and then collapsed over that time, partly because of financing and regulatory issues.Fidelity would have been one of the owners of Oncor had an earlier plan panned out.Now, the mutual fund giant, seeking to protect its original investment in Energy Future, joins a crowded field of bidders for the power distribution company. NextEra Energy Inc  is thought to be the lead bidder, according to people familiar with the matter, and Warren Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway Inc  has also ramped up its interest in Oncor, the people said. Creditors have estimated Oncor's value at $19 billion.Spokesmen for Fidelity, Energy Future and NextEra declined to comment. A request for comment from Berkshire Hathaway was not immediately returned. Energy Future began work on a new bankruptcy plan earlier this year.Like the prior plan, the new one calls for spinning off Energy Future's power plants and retail business to senior creditors, a process scheduled to wrap up this summer. Unlike the earlier plan, the spin off can happen without waiting for a deal on Oncor. Attorneys for Energy Future had been scheduled to have a new plan for the unit of the company that holds Oncor by July 8, but asked for a suspension of that deadline.Energy Future filed for bankruptcy burdened by debt stemming from a record 2007 leveraged buyout, led by KKR & Co LP, TPG and the private equity arm of Goldman Sachs Group Inc.

27,"   By Amrutha Gayathri  Power producer NextEra Energy Inc (NEE.N) said it agreed to buy bankrupt Texas power company Energy Future Holdings Corp's stake in Oncor Electric Delivery Co in a deal valued at about $18.4 billion.The deal will give NextEra access to the largest network of power lines in Texas. The company, whose shares were up 0.5 percent in morning trading, has been trying to buy Oncor for more than a year. The company said on Friday it would buy Energy Future's 80 percent indirect stake in Oncor through a newly formed subsidiary.Energy Future would spin off its power plants and retail electricity business under a reorganization plan.NextEra said the agreement to buy Energy Future would be filed in a Delaware court as part of the restructuring of the Texas company, allowing it to emerge from bankruptcy. NextEra will use $9.5 billion mainly to repay creditors of Oncor's holding company. The breakdown between cash and NextEra common stock to be provided to creditor classes will be closely scrutinized, said Angelo Thalassinos, a senior legal analyst at Reorg Research. Energy Future, the largest power company in Texas, filed for Chapter 11 in April 2014 after it failed to meet its debt obligations as electricity prices weakened. The bankruptcy is one of the largest ever in the United States.  When it filed for bankruptcy, the company was buried under debt of $42 billion, much of it taken to finance the buyout of what was then TXU Corp by KKR & Co, TPG Capital and an affiliate of Goldman Sachs.Oncor, which supplies power to 3.3 million customers, will become the power delivery business of NextEra after the transaction closes.     Separately, a unit of NextEra said on Friday it would sell two natural gas-fired power plants in Pennsylvania in a $760 million deal to an affiliate of private investment firm Starwood Energy Group Global LLC.Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC and Bank of America Merrill Lynch are NextEra's lead financial advisers for the Energy Future deal and Chadbourne & Parke LLP are its legal advisers.The takeover is expected to close in the first quarter of 2017.

The company said on Friday it would buy Energy Future's 80 percent indirect stake in Oncor through a newly formed subsidiary.Energy Future would spin off its power plants and retail electricity business under a reorganization plan.NextEra said the agreement to buy Energy Future would be filed in a Delaware court as part of the restructuring of the Texas company, allowing it to emerge from bankruptcy. NextEra will use $9.5 billion mainly to repay creditors of Oncor's holding company. The breakdown between cash and NextEra common stock to be provided to creditor classes will be closely scrutinized, said Angelo Thalassinos, a senior legal analyst at Reorg Research. Energy Future, the largest power company in Texas, filed for Chapter 11 in April 2014 after it failed to meet its debt obligations as electricity prices weakened. The bankruptcy is one of the largest ever in the United States.  When it filed for bankruptcy, the company was buried under debt of $42 billion, much of it taken to finance the buyout of what was then TXU Corp by KKR & Co, TPG Capital and an affiliate of Goldman Sachs.Oncor, which supplies power to 3.3 million customers, will become the power delivery business of NextEra after the transaction closes.     Separately, a unit of NextEra said on Friday it would sell two natural gas-fired power plants in Pennsylvania in a $760 million deal to an affiliate of private investment firm Starwood Energy Group Global LLC.Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC and Bank of America Merrill Lynch are NextEra's lead financial advisers for the Energy Future deal and Chadbourne & Parke LLP are its legal advisers.The takeover is expected to close in the first quarter of 2017.

The hardest hit utility so far was NextEra Energy Inc's (NEE.N) FPL power company in Florida, which reported a total of 983,000 customers affected by the storm. FPL said on its website it had already restored service to about 638,000 homes and businesses.

42,"  Almost 1.2 million homes and businesses were without power late Friday as Hurricane Matthew blasted Florida, Georgia and North and South Carolina, electric companies said.The outages are not as high as utilities had forecast and not expected to reach those levels because the storm has already passed most of the heavily populated southern part of Florida.On Thursday, NextEra Energy Inc's FPL power company, the biggest in Florida, forecast Matthew could leave as many as 2.5 million homes and businesses without service, some for extended periods of time.FPL said Friday afternoon it has already restored power to about 239,000 of the 923,000 affected by the storm, leaving about 685,000 still to be restored.Matthew, the fiercest cyclone to affect the United States since Superstorm Sandy hit the Northeast four years ago, triggered mass evacuations along the coast from Florida through Georgia and into South Carolina and North Carolina.  At 7 p.m. (2300 GMT) Matthew's eye or center was about 50 miles (80 km) east-northeast of Jacksonville Beach, Florida, with strong winds and storm surge already spreading into Georgia, the U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) said.Matthew skirted Florida on Friday morning with winds of up to 120 mph (195 kph) but had not made landfall by the evening. The NHC downgraded the storm to a Category 2 on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale of hurricane intensity as its sustained winds dropped to 110 mph. Category 5 is the strongest. Although weakening is forecast during the next 48 hours, Matthew is expected to remain a hurricane until it begins to move away from the southeastern United States on Sunday, the NHC noted.With so many power outages, the state's utilities do not have to import as much natural gas as usual to generate electricity. The amount of gas flowing into the state on the Florida Gas pipeline from Texas and Louisiana was expected to fall by about 800 million cubic feet per day on Friday from an average of 2.7 billion cubic feet per day over the past 30 days, according to Thomson Reuters data.

57,"   By Tom Hals | WILMINGTON, Del.  WILMINGTON, Del. Texas power company Energy Future Holdings Corp will start hearings in February to confirm its Chapter 11 bankruptcy exit plan and its proposed sale of its power lines business to NextEra Energy Inc (NEE.N) for $18.6 billion, a judge said on Thursday.Those hearings had been scheduled to begin on Thursday, but were postponed after the U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last month that the company owed holders of its first-lien and second-lien notes about $800 million more than anticipated.The company's plan is based on a sale of its main asset, its stake in the Texas-based Oncor power distribution business, to NextEra Energy of Juno Beach, Florida.Energy Future filed a modified plan of reorganization on Thursday that essentially shifted the cost of last month's appeals court ruling to holders of junior unsecured notes, by reducing their payout by roughly $800 million.  Those junior creditors argued to U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Christopher Sontchi in Wilmington, Delaware that NextEra should be on the hook for making the unanticipated payment to the first-lien and second-lien noteholders. If the Florida power company did not want to pay, then it should drop its merger plan, their lawyer argued.The unsecured noteholders also asked the judge for a six-week ""time out"" in the case.""We should be entitled to a short window to explore a potentially better alternative,"" said Abid Qureshi, a lawyer for Akin Gump Strauss Hauer Feld who represents the unsecured noteholders. He said the investors holding the unsecured so-called PIK notes wanted to see if they could find a buyer for Oncor to replace NextEra. Sontchi rejected their proposed schedule, saying it was important to move the two-and-a-half year case along or risk losing the NextEra deal.""A six-week time out is not reasonable,"" he said. ""There is a bird in hand here with NextEra."" Energy Future filed for bankruptcy in 2014 to cut its $42 billion in debt. The company has already spun off its power generation business, known as Luminant, and its TXU retail utility to senior lenders who were owed $24 billion. Energy Future was created from the record $45 billion leveraged buyout of TXU Corp in 2007, a deal led by KKR & Co and TPG Capital.
