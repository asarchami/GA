0,"   By Jennifer Ablan  Jan 16 Suvretta Capital Management, founded by a former portfolio manager for billionaire investors George Soros and Steven A. Cohen, told clients on Thursday that its bet against shares of J.C. Penney Company Inc. helped contribute to solid returns in the last two years.""On the short side, we have now generated profits three times (generating a total return of approximately 130 percent) in the past two years with our J.C. Penney positions,"" Suvretta Chief Investment Officer Aaron Cowen said in a client letter obtained by Reuters.Cowen, who was a former portfolio manager for Soros Fund Management and SAC Capital Advisors, said his $700 million-plus Suvretta Capital Management generated net returns of 8.9 percent for the fourth quarter and net returns of 26.3 percent for 2013.Soros Fund Management, which invests about $20 billion on his and his family's behalf, announced a large stake in J.C. Penney shares in early 2013 and began adding to its exposure as the year went on to become the retailer's second-largest investor at one point.The stock price of J.C. Penney, one of the oldest retailers in the nation, has lost 80 percent in the last two years. J.C. Penney said on Wednesday that it would close 33 stores across the country and shed about 2,000 jobs. The announcement indicated that the considerable management and investment turmoil of the last few years is not over. J.C. Penney fired one chief executive officer, Ron Johnson, last year and then brought back his predecessor, Myron E. Ullman III.""As we have written in the past, we have been amazed by how poorly JCP's strategic change negatively affected the business and by the inability of the Street to understand the magnitude of this failure,"" Cowen wrote. ""This strategic failure, along with headwinds we have seen in the middle end of the consumer market, was a powerful punch to JCP's business in the past year."" Cowen isn't bearish on all things consumer. He said in his letter that in 2013, Suvretta generated solid returns on its long positions in Dollar Tree Inc and Dollar General Corp, given the firm's positive view on serving the low-end consumer niche and the market's short-term bearishness on the low-end consumer due to the expiration of the payroll tax.""We like both of these investments, not only because the dollar store niche is under served and has a lot of expansion opportunity, but also because of the excellent management teams that are very shareholder friendly,"" he said.Suvretta also initiated a long position in Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc in the fourth quarter of 2012 when the firm felt that the multiple had compressed to the low end of its historical price-to-earnings range; the ""bear thesis"" that Chipotle is the same as Taco Bell was unfounded and that the restaurant chain's management was inclined to raise prices, which would boost both same-store sales and margins. Chipotle shares, which were recommended as short investment ideas by David Einhorn of Greenlight Capital and Jeffrey Gundlach of DoubleLine Capital, are up roughly 80 percent over the last year.Cowen said that as Chipotle management started to invest more in marketing and began to roll out catering, Suvretta believed Chipotle's multiple and earnings had a lot of room to expand. And though the increase in pricing was delayed until 2014, the thesis actually improved as 6.2 percent comparable- store sales growth in the third quarter proved that Chipotle ""had lots of levers left to pull, and the delayed pricing would result in a stronger moat versus weaker competitors who needed to raise prices to offset food inflation,"" Cowen wrote.While Suvretta has since exited its position, it is not because the firm has become bearish on Chipotle, Cowen said.""We believe it still offers a compelling, long-term investment. However, at 40x P/E and 20x EBITDA, the risk-reward has become less compelling. We have rotated capital into another restaurant investment, Burger King.""",2014-01-16,CMG,"Thu Jan 16, 2014 | 3:27pm EST","Suvretta cites big gains with J.C.

1,"   By Olivia Oran  Several full-service casual dining chains are looking to sell themselves, hoping that strong valuations from fast-growing rivals like Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (CMG.N) and Panera Bread Co (PNRA.O) mean that deals could be accomplished at favorable prices this year.Consumers have shunned restaurants that offer table service in favor of faster and cheaper options at the counter, an industry known as fast casual restaurants.As a result, a number of casual dining chains such as Ruby Tuesday Inc (RT.N) and TGI Fridays are exploring sales processes, people have told Reuters. Others like Dave & Busters and Darden's (DRI.N) Red Lobster chain are also considering sales.These companies have had their own struggles, but are coming to market at a time when valuations in the restaurant sector overall are at all-time highs.""The valuations for these brands appear pretty lofty in contrast to a pretty crummy operating environment for many of these companies which are rumored to be for sale,"" said Bob Derrington, an analyst at Wunderlich Securities.The stock prices of fast casual chains have soared, with companies trading at 23 times their last 12 months' earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.Even casual dining chains whose operating performances have deteriorated in the last several years have seen a spike in valuations. These chains, which traded at roughly nine times their last 12 month's EBITDA five years ago, are now trading at around 12 times, according to market data. One sizable restaurant deal has already been inked in January - Apollo Global Management LLC's (APO.N) agreement to acquire Chuck E Cheese parent CEC Entertainment Inc CEC.N for $1.3 billion.In the last two years, there were only two large restaurant deals: Roark Capital's acquisition of Carl's Jr. parent CKE Restaurants and Centerbridge's purchase of P.F.

It also said it would close 30 U.S. locations. Red Lobster, which Darden said it would sell or spin off amid pressure from activist investor firm Barington Capital as well as overall softness in casual dining, saw same-restaurant sales decline 4.5 percent in its fiscal second quarter ended November 24.""There are haves and have-nots in this business,"" said John Tibe, U.S. joint head of retail investment banking at JefferiesLLC.

Greenlight admitted that the firm's ongoing short position in Keurig Green Mountain Inc ""was our only significant loser,"" as the stock jumped more than $30 in the time period. Investors such as Einhorn take short positions in markets by borrowing shares and selling them, buying them back later at a lower price to make a profit.

Greenlight acquired shares at an average price of $35.49 and ended the first quarter at $38.85.As for SunEdison, a developer of solar power plants for businesses and utilities, Greenlight said the company was positioned as a winner due to the declining cost of solar energy combined with the rising cost of conventionally produced electricity.

Greenlight, overall, was down on the quarter, with a negative 1.5 percent return, as its short positions did worse than the long positions. Greenlight admitted that the firm's ongoing short position in Keurig Green Mountain Inc  ""was our only significant loser,"" as the stock jumped more than $30 in the time period.Investors such as Einhorn take short positions in markets by borrowing shares and selling them, buying them back later at a lower price to make a profit. The Chipotle position handed Greenlight a 33 percent loss, with the letter saying: ""This short gave us gas."" As for its short position in momentum stocks, Greenlight dubbed them ""The Bubble Basket"" and added that the firm had limited its short bets against certain momentum stocks because such bets can be ""dangerous"" when stock prices become disconnected from companies' fundamentals. ""What is uncertain is how much further the bubble can expand, and what might pop it,"" the letter said.Greenlight also closed short positions in Michael Kors Holdings Ltd, Australia's Fortescue Metals Group Ltd  and Canada's Loblaw Companies Ltd with losses, while selling profitable long positions in General Motors Co , Delphi Automotive Plc, NCR Corp and DST Systems Inc in the same period. Greenlight said the firm took new stakes in retailer Conn's Inc and SunEdison Inc. Shares in Conn's rose 7.65 percent on the day while SunEdison jumped 11.88 percent following the Greenlight recommendations.Conn's is a regional U.S. retailer of appliances and electronics with double-digit comparable store sales growth. Its share price fell from $79 at the start of the year to $32 after it cut its profit forecast due to bad debts. Greenlight acquired shares at an average price of $35.49 and ended the first quarter at $38.85.As for SunEdison, a developer of solar power plants for businesses and utilities, Greenlight said the company was positioned as a winner due to the declining cost of solar energy combined with the rising cost of conventionally produced electricity. ""The company has built a large pipeline of attractive projects secured by credit-worthy buyers of electricity,"" he said.Greenlight acquired shares at an average price of $15.55 and ended the first quarter at $18.84.

14,"  (Adds pay and industry details, comment by union pension adviser)By Ross KerberBOSTON May 15 Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc  failed to win a majority of shareholder support for its executive pay on Thursday, a noteworthy rebuke for the Denver restaurant chain that has been one of its industry's top performers.The pay had drawn criticism as too generous from public pension fund overseers and an influential union pension adviser, CtW Investment Group, which has put a new focus on reforming consumer companies.Chipotle spokesman Chris Arnold said via email that an advisory measure on the pay of the company's top executives received support from about 23 percent of shares voted at the company's annual meeting.""We take this very seriously,"" he said. Among Russell 3000 companies that have held pay votes so far this year, the next-lowest tally was at BroadSoft Inc. It received 27 percent support for its pay, according to consulting firm Semler Brossy.Chipotle spokesman Arnold said the company ""will continue to engage with our investors as we review our compensation programs that build value for all of our investors."" Chipotle is unusual in having dual chief executive officers, Steve Ells and Monty Moran. They were paid $25.1 million and $24.4 million, respectively, in 2013, according to the company's proxy statement.One of the main critics of Chipotle has been CtW Investment Group, the adviser to union pension funds. It said it expects the company's board to make changes.""With this overwhelming rejection of the pay plan by the Company's owners, we expect our board to get to work reining in runaway executive pay,"" said CtW Director Dieter Waizenegger in a statement. ""Chipotle's unbalanced approach to human capital management poses unacceptable risks to shareholders."" Annual advisory votes on executive pay plans are now widely required at U.S. companies and it is rare that they fail to win majorities.Among companies in the Russell 3000 index only eight had received less than 50 percent support this year through May 2, Semler Brossy said.Chipotle shares were down 2.1 percent at $493.88 on Thursday afternoon on the New York Stock Exchange.Over the past five years, Chipotle shares are up 558 percent, far ahead of the 111 percent advance on the S&P 500 Index over the same period.

CEOs often get well paid no matter how a company performs, Stringer said.Stringer said his office would vote the 2.6 million shares of McDonald's held in the city's pension funds against an advisory measure on executive pay, and that some investors worry income inequalities could threaten profit. ""You can't grow the economy the way we need to if low-wage workers don't have the money to spend on goods and services,"" he said.Stringer's funds also voted against the pay at Chipotle, whose co-CEOs Steve Ells and Monty Moran received total 2013 compensation of $25.1 million and $24.4 million, respectively. McDonald's Chief Executive Don Thompson made $9.5 million in 2013, down from $13.8 million in 2012.Chipotle shareholders offered a scant 23 percent support for a similar advisory pay proposal at the popular burrito seller on May 15, which has earned praise for eye-popping stock gains and scorn for supersizing compensation for its co-CEOs. But at least two big public pension fund managers that opposed Chipotle's pay proposal said they would support pay for McDonald's executives, including Thompson. The managers were the California State Teachers' Retirement System (CalSTRS) and the Florida State Board of Administration.Aeisha Mastagni, a CalSTRS Investment Officer, said the pay contests are quite different and noted how McDonald's market capitalization of $100 billion is more than six times that of Chipotle's. ""The compensation at McDonald's, in the grand scheme of things, it's quite reasonable,"" she said. She also noted how Thompson must cope with different challenges including a turn to healthier diets and having many more stores. McDonald's, she said, ""is a very different company than the growth story that's going on at Chipotle.""In addition, the influential proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services has recommended investors approve the pay at McDonald's, in contrast to its recommendation to vote against the Chipotle pay.Pay consultants view results below 70 percent support for executive pay as a sign that boards should revamp compensation, so even a close vote could pressure on McDonald's to make changes.McDonald's, in a proxy filing, asked shareholders to vote in favor of the pay proposal at its annual meeting, which will be closed to the media for the first time because of poor attendance. The vote comes as the chain battles market share losses to U.S. rivals and profit-squeezing spikes in beef costs.Shares in Chipotle have vastly outperformed McDonald's since 2010, rising 469 percent versus a 64 percent gain for the Golden Arches.

23,"  (Corrects paragraph 18 to show that Aaron Ryou buys lunch every day in Potbelly's hometown)By Lisa BaertleinLOS ANGELES, July 15 Early investors in Potbelly Corp have seen their shares in the toasted sandwich chain go cold.Expectations were high ahead of Potbelly's initial public offering in October. The roughly 300-unit Chicago-based sandwich chain was poised to grow, announcing plans to increase its restaurant count by at least 10 percent per year. And it had signed on Starbucks Corp Chief Executive Officer Howard Schultz's Maveron venture capital firm as its biggest investor.Shares more than doubled in their first trading session from $14 to almost $31.About nine months later, though, Potbelly's shares have shed those gains, and then some. Shares tumbled 25 percent, to $10.97, on July 10 after it warned of weak second-quarter sales, causing some analysts to blame company-specific problems rather than broader economic malaise. (The stock traded at $11.53 on July 15.)For growth-hungry investors seeking to replicate the success of Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc and Starbucks, it's a cautionary tale.""Companies like Starbucks and Chipotle come around once in a decade,"" William Blair restaurant analyst Sharon Zackfia said.Such long odds have not deterred investor appetite for restaurant IPOs, particularly those in the fast-casual category Chipotle popularized. Results have been mixed.Shares in Noodles & Co doubled in their June 2013 debut, to $36.75, almost 20 percent above their current price of about $29. Mediterranean-inspired Zoe's Kitchen Inc's jumped 65 percent, to $24.72, in its first trading day in April. Its shares also trade at around $29.Even before Potbelly went public there were signs the chain, which got its start as a food counter in an antique store in Chicago's tony Lincoln Park neighborhood, might not be the breakout hit investors hoped.Sales at established restaurants, a benchmark of industry performance, fell slightly in the first quarter of 2013, before the IPO, and have been down in the last two quarters.Returns on Potbelly restaurants are lower than at Chipotle and Panera Bread Co, and the chain had ""inconsistent performance"" in the critical New York City market, where it built 16 units in 18 months, Baird Equity Research analyst David Tarantino wrote in his first report on Potbelly in October 2013. Chipotle and Starbucks are known among investors for their ability to get more and more sales out of their shops, a skill that underpins their enviable same-restaurant sales growth.Panera was a top performer until late last year, when its CEO said ""operational friction"" limited the ability of its bakery-cafes to squeeze out higher sales.(For graphic on restaurant IPOs: link.reuters.com/suq42w)Potbelly boasts a ""neighborhood feel"" with homey decor, fresh-baked cookies and live music.Maveron remains Potbelly's largest shareholder, with 4.3 million shares as of May 15, according to the company. On Feb. 14, Maveron and related funds held 5.8 million shares, or a stake of nearly 20 percent, according to the company's proxy. Chicago software engineer Aaron Ryou, 33, buys lunch every day in Potbelly's hometown and says its expansion has hurt its novelty.""Now they're everywhere. It lost its luster,"" he said.Potbelly also lags bigger rivals such as Firehouse Subs, Jersey Mike's Subs and Jimmy John's Gourmet Sandwiches when it comes to having the best-tasting sandwiches, according to Consumer Reports surveys from 2011 and 2014. Privately held Subway, the biggest U.S. sandwich chain with a market share of roughly 60 percent, ranked lower than all of those chains.The proliferation of Potbelly and its rivals has only intensified what has long been a highly competitive business.The fast-food sandwich category Subway dominates grew 10.5 percent from the fall of 2012 to the fall of 2013. Adding to the pressure, fast-casual restaurant counts grew 5.9 percent during the same period, according to a restaurant census conducted by the NPD Group.""It's a crowded space,"" said Bob Goldin, executive vice president of Technomic.Neither the disappointing results from Potbelly nor the closure last week of cupcake purveyor Crumbs Bake Shop  appear to have cooled interest in restaurant IPOs.Chicken chain El Pollo Loco on Monday announced plans to go public. Other chains planning floats this year include The Habit Burger Grill, a popular upscale burger joint, fast-food chain Checkers Drive-In Restaurants Inc and arcade-eateries Dave & Buster's Inc.

24,"  Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc, one of the top-performing U.S. restaurant operators, on Monday reported a nearly 26 percent jump in quarterly profit after traffic to the burrito chain surged despite a menu price increase. The better-than-expected results prompted the company to boost a key sales forecast, and Chipotle shares soared almost 10 percent in after-hours trading to $646.71. Chipotle's stock, which was trading around $400 a year ago, is at all-time highs as many other established restaurant chains struggle to increase sales amid tepid economic growth and a move toward fresher and less-processed food.When the stock market closed on Monday, Chipotle had a market value of more than $18 billion. That was twice as much Burger King Worldwide, but still significantly less than former owner McDonald's Corp, with its market value of more than $96 billion.Denver-based Chipotle is known for serving antibiotic-free meats and organic produce. It has a loyal following among sought-after teen and young adult diners and is an investor favorite for its ability to crank sales out of its existing restaurants.  To that end, executives said on a conference call that Chipotle's service is the fastest it has ever been, due to added staff, increased training and software that analyzes performance. And, they said, service can keep getting faster. Sales at Chipotle restaurants open at least 13 months, a closely watched gauge of industry performance, increased 17.3 percent for the quarter, blowing past 23 analysts' average estimate for a gain of 10.5 percent. Chipotle reported a 13.4 percent same-restaurant sales rise for the first quarter.Chipotle is an outlier in the U.S. restaurant industry, which saw same-store sales rise just 0.3 percent in the second quarter, according to Black Box Intelligence, which tracks 19,000 restaurants. Based on last quarter's gains, Chipotle raised its forecast for same-restaurant sales growth, calling for an increase in the mid-teen percentages, versus its prior target for a high-single-digit percentage increase.Chipotle's second-quarter net income grew to $110.3  million, or $3.50 per share, from $87.9 million, or $2.82 per share, a year earlier. Revenue increased almost 29 percent to $1.05 billion.Chipotle raised prices during the second quarter to help offset higher costs for ingredients like beef, avocados, and dairy.

Traffic remained depressed amid tough competition from a range of rivals, which include Wendy's Co, Burger King Worldwide Inc  and privately held Chick-fil-A.Analysts had expected McDonald's U.S. comparable sales to fall just 0.3 percent, according to research firm Consensus Metrix. McDonald's results stood in sharp contrast to Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc, which on Monday reported a 17.3 percent jump in same-restaurant sales at its predominantly U.S. burrito restaurants.McDonald's said ongoing weakness in Germany was partly to blame for the 1 percent same-restaurant sales decline in Europe, which just beats out the United States as the fast-food chain's top revenue market. Analysts had expected a gain of 0.7 percent, according to Consensus Metrix. The Asia-Pacific, Middle East and Africa (APMEA) region rose 1.1 percent. The results got a boost from China, which just recovered from food safety and bird flu scares but now is embroiled in a new controversy over a major supplier's meat handling methods.

34,"  (Adds industry context, analyst and company comment, byline)By Lisa BaertleinJuly 21 Burrito chain Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc  last quarter achieved what many of its rivals could only dream of: It raised prices, yet attracted more diners during a period of sluggish economic growth.The Denver-based chain on Monday reported a nearly 26 percent jump in second-quarter profit after sales at established restaurants surged 17.3 percent.The better-than-expected results prompted Chipotle to boost its full-year same-restaurant sales forecast, and its shares rose almost 10 percent in after-hours trading to $648.80.Chipotle is known for serving antibiotic-free meats and organic produce, which appeal to trend-setting teen and young adult diners. Investors love the chain because its restaurants crank out more and more sales without increasing costs.Rival Panera Bread Co was on a similar trajectory until last year, when ""operational friction"" caused it to stumble on speed. Executives at Chipotle said speed of service is at record levels, due to its focus on nurturing top-performing staff and its use of technology that helps analyze and improve performance.""We are the fastest we have ever been at lunch time and at dinner time, but the averages throughout the entire day are speeding up as well,"" Chipotle co-Chief Executive Monty Moran said on a conference call with analysts.And, he said, service can get faster still. Investment Technology Group restaurant analyst Steve West agreed.""I wouldn't bet against Chipotle until they prove otherwise,"" said West, who noted that bears for years have wagered that Chipotle would hit its limit on service times.Based on last quarter's gains, Chipotle raised its forecast for 2014 same-restaurant sales growth to a mid-teen percentage range, from a single digit estimate previously. The company is an outlier in the U.S. restaurant industry, whose same-store sales rose just 0.3 percent in the second quarter, according to Black Box Intelligence, which tracks 19,000 restaurants.It is difficult for restaurants to raise prices when same-store sales growth is anemic, and McDonald's executives likely will face pricing questions after the company reports quarterly results on Tuesday morning.Chipotle boosted prices to help offset higher costs for ingredients like beef, avocados and dairy. While more people ate at the chain, some diners did switch from pricey beef to lower-cost chicken, executives said.Chipotle also has begun buying grass-fed, antibiotic-free beef from Australia to help ease tight supplies, co-Chief Executive Steve Ells said.Chipotle's stock, which was trading at around $400 a year ago, closed at $589.93 on Monday, valuing the company at more than $18 billion. That was twice as much Burger King Worldwide , but still significantly less than former owner McDonald's Corp, with its market value of more than $96 billion.

35,"   By Jeffrey Dastin  Corporate America can learn a lot from a chicken burrito. As many companies struggle to boost prices without alienating consumers, they may want to study Mexican-food chain Chipotle, which has managed to do both.Companies including Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (CMG.N), Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and PepsiCo (PEP.N)  have shown they're able to take advantage of quality, trendiness, and, in the case of Pepsi's snack foods, market dominance, to maintain high prices or even raise them faster than the inflation rate, now at about 2.1 percent in the U.S. Chipotle raised chicken-dish prices by 5 percent this year after leaving them untouched since 2011, and sales went up 29 percent last quarter.The Denver-based Mexican food specialist ""has done a great job cultivating a brand that commands pricing power,"" especially among millennials, who are mainly people in their 20s, said Morningstar analyst R.J. Hottovy. ""They've developed a very loyal following.""As the U.S. economy remains sluggish - full-year growth may now struggle to reach 2 percent – other companies such as mass market automaker Hyundai Motor Co (005380.KS) have felt the squeeze, with earnings under pressure from deep discounting in the U.S.Hershey Co (HSY.N) is raising candy bar and other product prices by an average of eight percent because of higher cocoa and dairy costs, even as it acknowledges the move will hurt its short-term sales. M&M maker Mars is following suit with a 7 percent increase.Chipotle is prospering even as it raises prices on burritos that are already expensive – about twice as much as those sold by Taco Bell (YUM.N). Besides its naturally-raised meats and organic ingredients such as beans and avocados, the company occupies the center of fast-casual dining - the booming ""sweet spot of the restaurant industry,"" according to Hottovy - in which customers order at a counter but eat quality products inside a hip space.And Chipotle is still growing. The chain runs about 1,700 restaurants in the U.S., and analyst Stephen Anderson at Miller Tabak estimates that it could grow to 3,100, expanding in less populated areas beyond its urban strongholds.Chipotle hadn't raised menu prices for three years, but the higher cost of ingredients compelled it to roll out up to a 6.5 percent average increase in the second quarter.To be sure, the hike did not go unnoticed: some customers said goodbye to steak burritos because their price jumped on average 4 percentage points more than Chipotle's chicken-based dishes, the company said.Other fast food chains haven't fared as well. Dunkin' Brands Group Inc (DNKN.O) cut its outlook for the year on Thursday, while quarterly profit fell more than expected at McDonald's Corp (MCD.N). The world's largest hamburger seller and other fast food chains have become ""hooked"" on discounting, Anderson said. While they built their reputations by delivering quick bites, new menu additions have often slowed their service, frustrating customers.""What [McDonald's needs] to do is further simplify the menu. It is too operationally complex, and I think that leaves a lot of potential for errors,"" Anderson said.In the last year, McDonald's converted its dollar menu to a ""$1-plus"" selection in its roughly 14,000 U.S. restaurants, but Anderson says increased competition both from convenience stores and the likes of Chipotle hurt its sales.Still, the tepid economy has mostly made consumers reluctant to spend on food, analysts say. In the absence of robust market growth, only the best and trendiest stand out, sometimes thanks to a more affluent customer cohort.Chipotle patrons tend to earn more than McDonald's customers, said Dan Greenhaus, the chief strategist at BTIG, making them ""more tolerant"" of higher prices. DIVERSE PRICE COMMANDERS Another pricing powerhouse, Apple, has studiously cultivated its high-end aura for years, and its iPhones and iPads continue to command a higher price tag on average than its rivals. In 2013, the company briefly turned to discounting to fend off competition by Samsung Electronics Co (005930.KS), but analysts say Apple has so far stuck to its knitting in 2014 – save for recent price cuts on its MacBook Air and iPod Touch.""Do they have a price premium [compared to the] competition? Absolutely,"" said Cross Research co-founder and analyst Shannon Cross. While she explained that Apple has refrained from hiking prices except when major currency movements occur, she said, ""In the consumer electronics world, keeping pricing flat is impressive.""Apple has now exceeded Wall Street gross-margin projections for three straight quarters – topping forecasts for around 37 percent with near-40 percent gross margins in the June quarter, as reported Tuesday - which contributed to its fastest earnings-per-share growth in seven quarters. PepsiCo recently succeeded in raising prices, too.Second-quarter sales rose 5 percent in its snack business and 2 percent for beverages, both buoyed by price increases. New product launches and inflation in regions such as Latin America caused the hikes, the company said.""For the balance of the year we feel comfortable that we can sustain pricing,"" PepsiCo chairman and CEO Indra Nooyi said Wednesday in a conference call.At Coca-Cola Co (KO.N), on the other hand, juice drink sales slowed after it raised prices to account for higher ingredient costs, the company said. Coke has no presence in the snack business, a fragmented market that PepsiCo dominates, according to Owen Fitzpatrick, head of U.S. equities at Deutsche Bank Asset and Wealth Management.""Snack foods are growing in terms of consumption, but when you look at carbonated soft drinks, people are moving away from them,"" Fitzpatrick said.Pepsi's snack strides suggest another source of pricing power: market dominance. Airline consolidation and fewer flights have also allowed for a steady increase in prices in that industry, according to Fitzpatrick.Yet competition is the reality that most face. While U.S. companies are hiring - the government said unemployment had reached a six-year low in June - many consumers still lack the confidence to spend unless a business truly gives them value.""If the [business] concept is old and tired, people just stop going to them,"" Anderson said.

40,"  (Adds context on menus, food ingredients)By Lisa BaertleinDec 10 McDonald's Corp said on Wednesday it plans to cut the number of items on its U.S. menus and use fewer ingredients in food as it moves to speed up service, bolster sales and offer consumers personalized options to compete better with Subway and Chipotle Mexican Grill.Mike Andres, the company's U.S. president, said starting in January menus will have eight fewer food items and five fewer Extra Value Meals.The world's biggest fast-food chain, which has not had a monthly gain in sales at established U.S. restaurants since October 2013, is also making the changes to reach out to consumers who are demanding simpler, more natural food choices.The company is testing its slimmed-down menus in six markets, including Bakersfield, California, and Knoxville, Tennessee, a spokeswoman said. The simplified menu boards will offer one Quarter Pounder with Cheese hamburger as compared with four on the regular menu, one Premium Chicken sandwich versus three, and one Snack Wrap versus three.Andres said McDonald's is not finished tweaking menus.""There's more to come,"" Andres said on a conference call with investors. ""We don't need to have a big menu board to offer variety."" The menu changes come as McDonald's plans to roll out its new ""Create Your Taste"" sandwich program to 2,000 of its 14,000-plus U.S. restaurants by the end of 2015.McDonald's is hoping that giving customers a choice of sandwich toppings will enable it to better compete with Subway and Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc, popular restaurants that allow diners to build their meals ingredient-by-ingredient. McDonald's abandoned a prior customization drive several years ago. Chief Executive Officer Don Thompson recently told Reuters that technology that allows customers to order from mobile phones and in-restaurant kiosks makes success more likely this time around.In addition, the company with the ""golden arches"" has been working to win back mothers and young diners, who increasingly want food that is fresh and minimally processed. In October, it launched a U.S. online campaign called ""Our food. Your questions."" aimed at addressing negative perceptions about its food quality.Andres said McDonald's ingredient labels need to be shorter and noted that simplifying ingredients is an enormous task, ""but we have to get started,"" offering a glimpse into how the company is rethinking its recipes.Busy McDonald's operators don't keep food in storage for very long, Andres said.

Anderson said the move should strengthen Chipotle's relationship with diners, many of whom like its ""food with integrity"" policy that focuses on using organic produce and antibiotic-free meats when those ingredients are available.""It shines their halo, but it has the potential to affect first-quarter"" results, said Anderson, who expects most Chipotle customers to switch to alternate proteins.    Citing the risk of lost sales, Anderson cut his first quarter per-share earnings forecast to a range of $3.84 to $3.87 from $3.93. He also lowered his growth forecast for sales at established restaurants to 10 to 10.3 percent from 11 percent. The supply crisis underscores the clash between the U.S. agriculture industry, commodity traders, food companies and American consumers, who have become increasingly concerned about what happens to their food before it reaches their plates.Chipotle made the decision Friday to cease buying pork from the unidentified supplier after one of its own auditors found ""inconsistencies"" with company standards requiring that pigs be raised with access to the outdoors or in deeply bedded barns. Chipotle also bans the use of antibiotics, but that was not the issue in this case, spokesman Chris Arnold said. Arnold declined to name the producer. Chipotle would not say how much pork it buys each year. It is not sure how long the shortages, which are largely confined to the eastern United States, will last. Starting on Thursday, Niman Ranch, Chipotle's biggest pork supplier, will increase its shipments until further notice,  said Jeff Tripician, an executive vice president for the farm.""They will start receiving 15 to 20 percent more pork from us on Monday,"" he said, noting that the extra product will come from Niman reserves. ""It won't solve their problem but it will help."" Finding additional supplies may be challenging for Chipotle, given that hog and beef herds in the United States have remained small, resulting in high prices for both organically- and conventionally-raised beef and pork.     While animal rights activists heralded Chipotle's decision to suspend the supplier that violated its rules, others were dismissive of supply chain squeeze having much impact on the broader food or farming sector.""It sounds like the problem can be fixed as soon as they take the little pigs for a walk,"" said James Burns, president of Chicago-based JBS Trading Co, a commodities brokerage firm.

43,"  Jan 13 Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc said it would suspend pork sales at about a third of its U.S. restaurants, following a routine audit that revealed one of its suppliers was not complying with its animal-welfare standards.The inspection of the undisclosed supplier exposed some inconsistencies in protocol, communications director Chris Arnold said. Suppliers must raise pigs with access to the outdoors or in deeply bedded barns to improve their comfort. They cannot use antibiotics.""We could fill that shortfall with conventionally raised pork, but the animal welfare standards fall well short of our requirements, and (we) simply aren't willing to make that compromise."" Chipotle will not serve ""carnitas"" at some of these restaurants, rather than use conventionally raised pork, said Arnold. Instead, the burrito seller is looking at a host of options to address the shortfall, including procuring additional pork from existing suppliers or finding more suppliers. Meanwhile, Chipotle could resume its relationship with the suspended supplier, if they become compliant with the company's standards, he added.

54,"  (Recasts first sentence with makeover plans, adds investor comments, company background)By Lisa BaertleinMarch  9 McDonald's Corp on Monday vowed to remake itself as a ""modern, progressive burger company"" after aggressive competition from Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc, Chick-fil-A and myriad ""better burger"" chains bit into U.S. restaurant sales last month.February ended the run of former Chief Executive Don Thompson. His short tenure included 2014, when falling profit, revenue and traffic resulted in one of McDonald's worst years in decades.Steve Easterbrook, a McDonald's insider who led two UK-based restaurant chains before returning to the company in 2013, took the helm at the Golden Arches on March 1.The company that virtually invented fast food has struggled to find the right recipe to meet diners' growing appetite for healthier, fresher food. In his first big move as CEO, Easterbrook last week announced that McDonald's USA will switch to chicken raised with fewer antibiotics. The policy, which will affect McNuggets and other products sold in its roughly 14,000 U.S. stores, will put McDonald's more in step with Chipotle and Chick-fil-A.McDonald's shares were up 0.8 percent at $97.90 at midday. The stock is up about 10 percent since Easterbrook's promotion was announced in late January. Sales at U.S. restaurants open at least 13 months dropped a steeper-than-expected 4 percent in February, contributing to the 1.7 percent decline in global sales for the month.Analysts, on average, had expected a 0.7 percent fall for the United States and a 0.3 percent drop worldwide, according to research firm Consensus Metrix.February sales results from Europe were slightly better than expected, but the unit that includes Asia continued to struggle with the after-effects of a supply chain scandal last year. McDonald's has been trimming complicated menus to speed up service; giving restaurant operators more control over aspects including regional food choices; testing customized burgers and sandwiches to compete with Chipotle, Subway and other popular restaurants; and tweaking advertising to emphasize ""Lovin,"" a play on the company's ubiquitous ""I'm lovin' it"" tagline.Still, one pension fund adviser on Monday renewed its call for McDonald's to shake up its board.""Today's disappointing numbers underscore the widespread reforms McDonald's requires ... and these changes must go beyond new management to include refreshing its stale and insular board,"" said Dieter Waizenegger, executive director of the CtW Investment Group, which advises union pension funds that hold a small percentage of McDonald's shares.(Reporting by Lisa Baertlein in Los Angeles; additional reporting by Sruthi Ramakrishnan in Bengaluru; editing by Savio D'Souza and Matthew Lewis)",2015-03-09,CMG,"Mon Mar 9, 2015 | 12:11pm EDT",UPDATE 2-McDonald's vows 'modern' makeover amid U.S. sales struggle,http://www.reuters.com//article/mcdonalds-sales-idUSL4N0WB3UX20150309?type=companyNews

Visa ended 4.07 percent higher at $68.01 after hitting a record high of $69.98, while MasterCard closed up 3.91 percent after China said it would open up its market to foreign firms for clearing domestic bank card transactions.McDonald's surged 3.13 percent after it said it was working on a plan to reverse its shrinking sales. A week ago, more than 80 percent of the S&P 500 companies to have posted their March-quarter earnings had beaten estimates. But with 121 reports now in, that number has slipped to 71.9 percent - just above the 70 percent earnings beat rate seen over the past four quarters.

65,"   By Lisa Baertlein  Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc on Monday said the 46 ingredients used in its roughly 1,800 restaurants were now free of genetically modified organisms, becoming the first major U.S. restaurant chain to make that switch.U.S. diners, particularly those in the sought-after young millennial generation, are seeking fresh foods that are less processed and more natural or organic. Part of that trend includes GMO-free foods.GMO advocates have warned that producing foods that are not genetically engineered would increase costs. Chipotle, however, said its move did not result in significantly higher ingredient costs, and it did not raise prices as a result of going GMO-free.   Some of the most popular U.S. GMO crops are corn, soybeans and canola, which are staple ingredients in virtually every type of prepared and packaged food, from soup and tofu to breakfast cereals and chips.  Scientists have spliced the DNA of those GMO crops with that from different species. The aim, among other things, is to make them resistant to pests or more tolerant to drought. Organic foods do not contain GMOs.While proponents and critics disagree over the safety, environmental impacts and effectiveness of genetically engineered crops, a consumer backlash against them already has led General Mills Inc to remove GMOs from its original Cheerios.  ""Though many countries have already restricted or banned the use of GMO crops, it's clear that a lot of research is still needed before we can truly understand all of the implications of widespread GMO cultivation and consumption,"" Chipotle founder and co-Chief Executive Officer Steve Ells said in a statement.""While that debate continues, we decided to move to non-GMO ingredients."" The company said its small ShopHouse Southeast Asian Kitchen chain also became GMO-free. Shares of Chipotle, which is also removing tortilla additives such as preservatives and dough conditioners, were up 0.6 percent to $641.11.

67,"   By Anjali Athavaley and Subrat Patnaik  Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (CMG.N) on Tuesday said its quarterly profit beat estimates, but the burrito chain reported lower than expected sales at its established restaurants, initially sending its shares down in extended trading. Sales at Chipotle restaurants open at least 13 months, a metric closely watched by Wall Street, dropped to 4.3 percent in the second quarter from double-digit percentage growth in the five prior quarters. It also fell short of the 5.8 percent increase projected by analysts polled by Consensus Metrix.

71,"   By Ross Kerber | BOSTON  BOSTON Aug 25 Popular consumer brands Discovery Communications, Chipotle Mexican Grill and CVS Health Corp pay their chief executive officers more than a thousand times what they pay their typical worker, giving them the biggest internal pay gaps among S&P 500 companies, according to a study released on Tuesday.The research from job-hunting website Glassdoor.com provides an early glimpse of data that publicly traded companies will be required by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to report starting in 2017. On average, the research showed that a CEO of an S&P 500 company makes 204 times as much as the company's median worker.""I don't think most people are aware of the inequality of payrolls within a firm,"" Glassdoor's chief economist, Andrew Chamberlain, said.The study used CEO compensation figures reported by 441 S&P 500 companies through Aug. 14 and Glassdoor.com user reports about salaries at those companies. Only companies for which Glassdoor had 30 or more worker salary reports were included. The data could be skewed if workers under-counted tips or bonuses, Glassdoor said. Cable network operator Discovery had the biggest pay gap. Its CEO, David Zaslav, was the highest paid among S&P 500 companies last year, at $156 million. That was 1,951 times the amount paid to Discovery's median worker, Glassdoor found.In second and third place were restaurant chain Chipotle and drugstore operator CVS, whose CEOs in 2014 received $28.9 million and $32.4 million, respectively, both more than 1,000 times their median workers, according to the study. CVS spokeswoman Carolyn Castel said its employees have opportunities to be promoted and receive higher pay, while its CEO is paid in line with industry standards. Discovery and Chipotle representatives did not return messages requesting comment.The Glassdoor study found the average CEO received $13.8 million, while the median worker at those CEO's companies made an average of $77,800. Glassdoor's findings were in line with other studies, said Todd Sirras, managing director of compensation consulting firm Semler Brossy. He said the new reporting requirements could add pressure on companies to change their executive pay plans.""It will be one more arrow to sling at companies,"" he said.In a few cases workers made more than their CEOs, such as at Google Inc where CEO Larry Page got $1 in 2014. His median worker got $153,150, Glassdoor said.(Reporting by Ross Kerber; Editing by Leslie Adler)",2015-08-25,CMG,"Tue Aug 25, 2015 | 9:00am EDT",Three big US consumer companies have highest CEO pay gaps -study,http://www.reuters.com//article/ceopay-gap-study-idUSL5N10Z3S820150825?type=companyNews

82,"  Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (CMG.N) on Tuesday posted disappointing third-quarter profits and said growth would cool further in 2016, sending shares in the popular burrito chain down more than 7 percent in extended trading.Chipotle has long been an investor favorite for its tough-to-replicate ability to increase sales without adding costs but higher expenses for labor, advertising and promotions took their toll in the quarter.    The higher costs more than offset declining outlays for ingredients such as avocados and dairy products.Third-quarter profit was up almost 11 percent to $144.9 million, or $4.59 per share, but that fell 3 cents short of analysts' average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Executives said they now expect 2016 sales at established restaurants to grow in the low-single-digit percentages. That would be a deceleration from the low-to-mid single-digit same-store sales growth it forecast for this year. Third-quarter sales at Chipotle restaurants open at least 13 months were up 2.6 percent, just better than analysts expected. But that was a tick down from the 4.3 percent growth in the second quarter and a significant slowdown from the double-digit percentage growth in the five quarters before that. Shares in the Denver-based chain fell $50.23 to $655.40 in extended trading. Chipotle, known for using antibiotic-free meat and removing genetically modified organisms from its ingredients, said it expected that this quarter would see the full restoration of pork supplies lost early this year when it suspended a supplier for not complying with its animal welfare standards. That supply hiccup affected about 600 restaurants, or about one-third of Chipotle's base.

""We offer our deepest sympathies to those that have been affected by this situation.""It is the third outbreak of food contamination at Chipotle restaurants since August. Those earlier cases involved salmonella and the highly infectious virus norovirus.The 1,700-outlet chain has grown quickly since it opened in 1993 with a single location, distinguishing itself from typical fast-food restaurants by touting its use of healthy and high-quality fresh ingredients in its menu of burritos, tacos and salads.There is a growing trend among restaurants, as with Chipotle, to use more fresh, unprocessed food. While that may be good for nutrition, experts say it raises the risk of foodborne illness because cooking kills pathogens that cause illness. The Oregon Health Authority said three cases of E. coli in Oregon and at least 19 in Washington have been linked to eating at Chipotle restaurants since Oct. 14, with ages ranging from  11 to 64. One third of affected customers have been hospitalized, but no deaths have been reported.But more cases are likely to be reported, the agency said, because some people who may have been infected with the intestinal bug likely have not yet sought medical care.​​""Health officials want people who have eaten at a Chipotle between October 14 and 23, and become ill with vomiting and bloody diarrhea, to see their health care provider and mention this outbreak,"" the agency said in a notice on its website. E. coli is among a vast array of bacteria that live in the human gut and which cause no problems. But some strains can cause serious symptoms and even be life-threatening, and are spread by oral contact with fecal matter.The incidents come on the heels of contamination outbreaks from other pathogens at the chain's restaurants in Minnesota and California this summer.Minnesota health officials in September said tomatoes used in 22 of Chipotle's restaurants infected dozens of patrons the month before with salmonella, including some who were hospitalized, largely in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area. The company has since switched tomato suppliers.    Public health officials in Simi Valley, California, in August confirmed that the contagious norovirus was the reason about 80 customers reported feeling ill after eating at a local Chipotle restaurant. The virus, which causes symptoms similar to those caused by E. coli, can be contracted from an infected person or from contaminated food, water or surfaces.Food poisoning outbreaks at restaurant chains happen infrequently, and often trigger lawsuits. But sales tend to recover relatively quickly, as seen in cases involving Taco Bell (YUM.N) in 2011 and Subway in 2008, unless the contaminations are lethal.Jack in the Box (JACK.O) almost collapsed in 1993 after four children died from eating contaminated and undercooked meat at that chain.

Sixteen people have been hospitalized and no deaths have been reported. The source of the food contamination has not been identified.The outbreak was first identified in Seattle, Washington and Portland, Oregon, and Chipotle closed all 43 restaurants in those markets on Oct. 31.Last week, the company reopened those units after deep-cleaning the properties and replacing food. But the new reports hitting the company, whose tagline is ""Food with Integrity,"" dealt another blow to the chain. Its shares tumbled 12.3 percent to $536.19 on Friday. Chipotle, which also has hired food safety consultants, is testing food and changing food preparation procedures, and said it is taking similar actions at the other restaurants linked to the outbreak.The new reports of illness were tied to Chipotle restaurants in Turlock, California; Akron, Ohio; Amherst, New York; and Burnsville, Minnesota.Due to the timing of visits - in late October and on Nov. 6 - and the average time of illness onset, Chipotle does not believe it is necessary to close those restaurants, company spokesman Chris Arnold said. The number of cases could go higher as state and federal investigators check to see if other reported E. coli illnesses match the Chipotle strain.One Chicago customer, who ordered a chicken bowl with brown rice on Friday afternoon, was undeterred by the news.""If it was closer to home, you might think about it more,"" said the customer, who declined to give his name. Analysts expect the outbreak, Chipotle's third food safety lapse this year, to dent sales.Investigators previously said that produce may be responsible for the outbreak, but the hunt is still on for the source of the food contamination.Seattle attorney Bill Marler, who is representing nearly three dozen people affected by the outbreak in Oregon and Washington state, said the increase in reported cases raises the likelihood that the culprit will be identified.""There has to be a common supplier with a common food item,"" Marler said.According to the CDC, most people infected with E. coli develop symptoms of illness about 3 to 4 days after contact with the germ.

106,"   By Lisa Baertlein | LOS ANGELES  LOS ANGELES The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said on Friday that three additional states reported E. coli infections from the same strain as the Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG.N) outbreak, sending shares in the chain down more than 12 percent.The reports of illness came from California, Ohio and New York, the CDC said, bringing to six the number of states affected. The outbreak started in Washington state and Oregon before appearing in Minnesota this week.The CDC earlier this week reported one Minnesota case with the same DNA fingerprint as the others, but it was not linked to the popular burrito chain.  In its update on Friday, the CDC reported that a second person in Minnesota who ate at Chipotle became ill from the same strain of E. coli. The CDC said 45 people have gotten food poisoning from the E. coli O26 outbreak strain, and of those, 43 reported eating at Chipotle.Shares in Chipotle fell by $75.32 to $536.19 following the CDC announcement. The new reports of illness were linked to Chipotle restaurants in Turlock, California; Akron, Ohio; Amherst, New York; and Burnsville, Minnesota. Due to the timing of reported visits - in late October and on Nov. 6 - Chipotle does not believe it is necessary to close those restaurants, spokesman Chris Arnold said. According to the CDC, most people infected with E. coli develop symptoms of illness about 3 to 4 days after contact with the germ. Chipotle said in a statement that investigators have suggested that it is not unusual to see additional cases as an investigation moves forward.Public health investigators first identified the E. coli O26 infections in people who had eaten at Chipotle restaurants around Seattle and Portland, Oregon. Chipotle last week reopened 43 restaurants in those areas after deep cleaning the eateries and replacing food. The company, which also has hired food safety consultants and is changing food preparation procedures, is taking similar actions at the other restaurants linked to the outbreak.

107,"   By Lisa Baertlein | LOS ANGELES  LOS ANGELES A widening U.S. E. coli outbreak has slammed sales at Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc, the company said on Friday, hours after federal authorities reported that people in nine states have now contracted food poisoning.Shares in the popular burrito chain tumbled nearly 8 percent to $518 in extended trading after Chipotle warned that sales at established restaurants could drop 8 to 11 percent for the fourth quarter from a year earlier. This would be the first such decline in company history. Investigators said the outbreak could widen again as local agencies upload data. Chipotle said in a regulatory filing that its sales could take more hits from ""further developments, including potential additional announcements from federal and state health authorities.""The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported related E. coli O26 illness in three new states. Forty-seven of the 52 people sickened say they ate at Chipotle before falling ill.The government investigators added Illinois, Maryland and Pennsylvania to a list of states that already included California, Minnesota, New York, Ohio, Oregon and Washington. There were seven more U.S cases, with four of those linked to Chipotle. The company said it has been tightening its food safety procedures.The source of the outbreak is still unknown. Investigators suspect a fresh produce item that was shipped from one location to multiple restaurants. Two of the newly reported illnesses started in October, and five started in November, suggesting the outbreak was not as short lived as previously thought.

This would be the first such decline in company history.Investigators said the outbreak could widen again as local agencies upload data. Chipotle said in a regulatory filing that its sales could take more hits from ""further developments, including potential additional announcements from federal and state health authorities.""The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported related E. coli O26 illness in three new states. Forty-seven of the 52 people sickened say they ate at Chipotle before falling ill. The government investigators added Illinois, Maryland and Pennsylvania to a list of states that already included California, Minnesota, New York, Ohio, Oregon and Washington. There were seven more U.S cases, with four of those linked to Chipotle.The company said it has been tightening its food safety procedures.The source of the outbreak is still unknown. Investigators suspect a fresh produce item that was shipped from one location to multiple restaurants.

A U.S. Food and Drug Administration laboratory analysis did not confirm the presence of E. coli in a sample of celery and onion mix collected from a Costco store in Montana, the agency said on Tuesday. The incident is the latest occurrence of E. coli where the source of the outbreak is unknown. Health officials have still not found the cause of an E. coli outbreak at restaurants owned by Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc in nine states.In the Costco outbreak, the celery and onion mix was made by Taylor Farms for use in the salad. In November, Taylor Farms Pacific Inc voluntarily recalled 71 products sold at retailers such as Safeway and Wal-Mart Stores Inc citing ""an abundance of caution"" due to the mix testing positive for E. coli in a sample taken by the Montana Department of Health. The state performed a rapid preliminary test and then sent a partial sample of the celery and onion mix to the FDA, which performed a more accurate test that involves growing a colony of the bacteria. Fourteen of 16 people bought or ate rotisserie chicken salad from Costco in the week before the illness started.Costco shares were little changed at $169 in after-hours trading. Chipotle warned that sales at established restaurants could drop 8 percent to 11 percent for the fourth quarter from a year earlier due to the outbreak. The time between ingesting E. coli bacteria and feeling sick is usually three to four days, but may be as short as one day or as long as 10 days, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Over 120 Boston College students have reported to Boston College Health Services with symptoms consistent with the norovirus, Boston College spokesman Jack Dunn said.The students have also been tested for E. coli, but results are awaited, he said.

Still, on Thursday, Ells took a more apologetic tone in emphasizing its safety changes.Ells said the affected Boston restaurant would reopen after being completely sanitized and having all of its employees tested for norovirus, which is highly contagious and spreads easily through contaminated food and surfaces.Regarding the E. coli outbreak, Ells said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has still not found an exact source for the bacteria, which can cause severe diarrhea and vomiting.He said Chipotle's new food safety procedures will put it 10 to 15 years ahead of industry standards.""We're doing a lot to rectify this and to make sure this doesn't happen again.""

The highly contagious virus can cause vomiting and diarrhea.The investigation announced on Wednesday is the latest headache for the company, which has seen sales slump after an E. coli outbreak sickened more than 50 people in nine states in October and November.That outbreak was followed by a norovirus incident at a  restaurant in Brighton, Massachusetts the week of Dec. 7, in which 120 Boston College students fell ill. (1.usa.gov/1JtQlLV) BROAD RANGE OF DOCUMENTS Chipotle said the subpoena was served in December. It  requires the company to produce a broad range of documents related to the August norovirus incident at its restaurant in Simi Valley, California, which sickened more than 200 people, including 18 workers.In September, two California residents sued Chipotle for damages in U.S. court after they said they became sick from eating at the Simi Valley location. Alyssa McDonald vomited repeatedly, developed ""explosive diarrhea,"" and suffered chest pains after eating at restaurant, according to court documents. Another customer said she had to go to a hospital emergency room for days.The Ventura County Health Department found her stool tested positive for norovirus, the lawsuit said.Ventura County health official Doug Beach said his office was interviewed by the FDA and U.S. Attorney's office in the fall. Authorities, he said, focused their lines of enquiry squarely on Chipotle. A federal investigation into a one-restaurant outbreak is surprising since there wasn't a clear interstate element, said Bill Marler, a Seattle-based lawyer who is representing customers saying they were sickened in Simi Valley.The FDA declined to comment specifically on the investigation. The U.S. Attorney's office declined to comment, as did Chipotle spokesman Chris Arnold.Chipotle said same-store sales were trending down 16 percent at the onset of December but fell 34 percent after the Brighton incident and the subsequent national media attention it garnered.Overall same-restaurant sales for December were down 30 percent, the company said.Any more incremental bad news, particularly if there is an unfavorable decision from the grand jury, could trigger consideration among shareholders of a management change, Maxim Group analyst Stephen Anderson said.The company, which also announced a $300 million share buyback, said it will fully cooperate with the probe.The company's shares have fallen nearly 30 percent since Oct. 31, when the first E. coli outbreak was reported.

145,"   By Sarah N. Lynch | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The U.S. Justice Department's consumer protection unit is looking into a norovirus outbreak at a Chipotle restaurant in California, in a sign that a recent probe launched by federal prosecutors in California is getting attention at Washington headquarters.Chipotle Mexican Grill has been under increasing scrutiny in the wake of a series of foodborne illnesses that have led to a decline in its shares and a projected plunge in its fourth-quarter same-store sales.Chipotle disclosed on Wednesday that the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of California had served the company with a grand jury subpoena in December as part of a criminal investigation by that office and the Food and Drug Administration.Officials in the Justice Department's Consumer Protection Branch contacted Los Angeles federal prosecutors to discuss the early stage inquiry on Thursday, according to people familiar with the matter.While officials in the Justice Department's headquarters in Washington often work with regional prosecutors, their interest in the Chipotle matter underscores the federal government's stepped-up enforcement of food safety laws in recent years.Prominent prosecutions include a 2015 case in which a subsidiary of ConAgra Foods Inc agreed to plead guilty and pay $11.2 million in connection with shipping peanut butter tainted with salmonella. In September, the former head of the Peanut Corporation of America was sentenced to 28 years in prison for his role in a salmonella outbreak that killed nine people.The subpoena over the Chipotle outbreak requires the company to hand over documents in connection with an August 2015 outbreak of norovirus at one of its restaurants in Simi Valley, which sickened more than 200 people.One of the sources, who asked not to be named because the probe is not public, said investigators at this point are only looking at the Simi Valley outbreak and that it is unclear where the inquiry will lead. A spokesman for Chipotle said the company plans to cooperate with the investigation as it moves forward.Chipotle has come under fire for a rash of recent outbreaks of foodborne illnesses at its restaurants across several states, involving E. coli, salmonella and norovirus.The incidents prompted the Los Angeles Department of Public Health to preemptively review its inspection records for local Chipotle restaurants, even though there have been no outbreaks there. The county also plans to call a meeting with Chipotle representatives to discuss food safety.""I suspect we'll find conditions that, in view of everything that's happening around the country, warrant us calling Chipotle in and reviewing our violation history with them,” said Angelo Bellomo, the Deputy Director of Health Protection. ""We don't wait,” he added. “We really shouldn't be waiting for foodborne illnesses or outbreaks to take action.""    Lawyers have said a federal investigation of the Chipotle outbreak is highly unusual, because past prosecutions involving foodborne illnesses have focused on food producers who were the original source of the problems such as farmers or food manufacturers, not the restaurants or stores that sold the products.They say the most likely legal tool that prosecutors could invoke is the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, which gives the Justice Department both criminal and civil powers to bring charges.Under that law, a company or individual can face felony or misdemeanor charges if ""adulterated"" food that is harmful to human health or is prepared in unsanitary conditions is introduced across state lines.  For it to be a felony, prosecutors must prove there was an intent to defraud or mislead.Experts say it remains unclear if the law could apply to Chipotle because the investigation so far is focused on just one restaurant location, and the outbreak involves norovirus- an illness that is easily transferred from person-to-person contact and may not be tied to an ""adulterated"" food.Reuters could not determine what legal theories prosecutors may be pursuing in the investigation.A Justice Department official declined to comment about Chipotle when asked by Reuters earlier this week.The unit within the U.S. Attorney's Los Angeles office that is leading the charge is a branch that specializes in environmental and community safety crimes.The head of the unit, Joseph Johns, has a track record for working on health and environmental crimes, including a 1998 case against juice maker Odwalla, which pleaded guilty and was fined $1.5 million in connection with an E. Coli outbreak that killed one person and sickened dozens. (Reporting by Sarah N.

146,"   By Lisa Baertlein and Noel Randewich | LOS ANGELES/SAN FRANCISCO  LOS ANGELES/SAN FRANCISCO Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc executives on Wednesday said they are confident that steps they are taking to tighten food safety at the popular burrito chain will prevent future food poisoning outbreaks.The company, which has won over diners and forced change on the restaurant industry by serving fresher, less-processed food, is grappling to overcome a series of outbreaks that have driven away diners, hammered its high-flying stock and spawned both a federal criminal probe and a shareholder lawsuit.Shares in Chipotle, which uses meat mainly from animals that have not been given antibiotics and removed genetically modified organisms (GMOs) from its food, were up 5.4 percent at $425.94 in afternoon trade on Wednesday. Still, the stock is down more than 30 percent from pre-E. coli outbreak levels.Among other things, executives said they are waiting for federal health officials to call an end to an E. coli outbreak that has sickened more than 50 people in nine states after first being linked to Chipotle restaurants in the Pacific Northwest on Oct. 31. We ""need to reassure our customers that this can't happen again, and that we are going to reduce the risk of this kind of an outbreak from occurring again to near zero,"" Chipotle founder and co-Chief Executive Steve Ells said at the ICR Conference in Orlando, Florida.The company is working with suppliers and employees to eliminate food contamination through sourcing, training and testing.Diners and food safety experts have been stunned by a recent series of Chipotle-linked outbreaks, which include E. coli, salmonella and norovirus. Investors at the ICR Conference pressed executives for assurances that the chain's food is safe and chided them for what, at times, has been perceived as a lack of humility in their dealings with investors and the public.Chipotle will begin efforts to woo back customers next month with stepped-up advertising and direct outreach to its most loyal customers.

""We held steady our investment in Chipotle, a longtime holding, deciding to hang in there, based in part on management's focus on productivity and comparable-restaurant sales,"" Contrafund portfolio manager Will Danoff said in a fourth-quarter update released this week.Chipotle hurt Contrafund's performance the most, shaving half a percentage point off the $110 billion fund's return in the fourth quarter, when its shares lost about a third of their value because of the E. coli outbreak.

160,"   By Noel Randewich | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Chipotle Mexican Grill's (CMG.N) stock climbed on Tuesday for a second consecutive day, ahead of the restaurant chain's fourth-quarter report, on bets that the fallout from recent outbreaks of food-borne illness has been fully priced in.The stock rose 1.3 percent, bringing its two-day gain to almost 7 percent, after the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Monday that recent E.coli outbreaks linked to Chipotle restaurants appeared to be over.The stock has recovered 20 percent from a 3-year low of $404.26 hit on Jan. 12, bolstered by company assurances that it could prevent future outbreaks, but it remains down 33 percent from September.A series of food-borne illnesses linked to Chipotle since October have driven away diners, hammered its high-flying stock and spawned both a federal criminal probe and a shareholder lawsuit. While Taco Bell and other restaurant chains have been linked to E.coli outbreaks in the past, Chipotle's troubles have been magnified because it markets itself as a seller of healthy, high-quality food.Its quarterly report after the market closes on Tuesday will give investors a fresh glimpse of how bad the damage has been, and how long it may take to recover. Chipotle has said same-store sales would drop 14.6 in the December quarter, its first three-month decline since it went public in 2006. Wall Street expects a continued impact from the outbreaks, with 2016 revenue falling 21 percent and net income down 18 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data.""I think you'll see first signs of a recovery in sales by the fourth quarter of this year, but I think even then it's going to be a gradual recovery,"" said Maxim analyst Stephen Anderson. After two analysts raised their price targets for Chipotle's stock this week, the median target of analysts tracked by Thomson Reuters is $484, just above Tuesday's price of $480.90 but far below the median target of $756 just three months ago.

161,"   By Sruthi Ramakrishnan  Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc's (CMG.N) plans to spend heavily on marketing and food safety after a spate of E.coli and norovirus outbreaks will help the burrito chain regain its popularity, analysts said, but it's anyone's guess when sales will recover.The troubled company said on Tuesday that sales at established restaurants plunged by more than a third in January after declining 15 percent in the fourth quarter.Chipotle's shares fell as much as 7 percent on Wednesday morning, but recovered to be down 3 percent at midday.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said on Monday that the E.coli outbreaks appeared to be over, but Chipotle now faces a nationwide federal probe into its food-safety practices.Denver-based Chipotle is famous for serving food made with fresh produce and meats raised without antibiotics.""While we do expect (comparable sales) trends to sequentially improve behind a major PR and advertising campaign set to launch next week and the recent closing of the CDC E. coli investigation, the pace of recovery remains quite uncertain,"" Raymond James analyst Brian Vaccaro said.A favorite with customers and investors alike until the E.coli outbreak, Chipotle's stock has lost a quarter of its value since its food safety problems began in November. ""We think Chipotle is pretty much near its low point and can't get any worse,"" said Sean Sun, associate portfolio manager at Thornburg Core Growth Fund (THCGX.O).At the end of December, 1.4 percent of Thornburg's assets were invested in Chipotle.Most restaurants that have experienced a food safety issue return to sustained same-store sales growth within 12-15 months, Wells Fargo analyst Jeff Farmer wrote in a client note. Farmer raised his rating on Chipotle stock to ""Outperform"" from ""Market Perform"".At least eight brokerages cut price targets on Chipotle's stock following the release of its results.The median price target is $475, suggesting the stock could rise 8 percent off Wednesday's low in the next 12 months.Chipotle's shares were changing hands around $430 in early afternoon trading. The company's spending could hit margins but show its willingness to regain sales momentum, analysts said.Several said investors should stay on the sidelines until sales showed signs of sustained recovery.""...We continue to have concerns over Chipotle's risk/reward profile,"" Cowen & Co analyst Andrew Charles said.Of 33 analysts covering the stock, 19 have a ""hold"" rating, 13 a ""buy"" or higher and one a ""sell"".

173,"   By Brian Snyder and Lisa Baertlein | BILLERICA, Mass./LOS ANGELES  BILLERICA, Mass./LOS ANGELES Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc received praise for its handling of potential norovirus infections at a Boston-area restaurant, as sick employees stayed home and the burrito chain quickly cleaned the restaurant.Shares of Chipotle fell as much as 6.1 percent early, then gained back some ground after the head of the Billerica, Massachusetts public health department said the restaurant was cleaned and would reopen on Thursday. The stock closed down 3.4 percent at $506.63.The closure of the Chipotle in the Boston suburb was seen as a partial test of a new food safety system rolled out after a series of illnesses hit the fresh burrito chain last year. That workers stayed home in particular was a good sign, said Doug Powell, publisher of the food safety site barfblog.com. ""It is an indication that the system is working,"" he said. But customers may focus only on the sickness, not the company response. For burrito fans, ""It's just - ooh, they're barfing at Chipotle again,"" Powell said.The company response was not a test of new measures to ensure ingredients are safe and avoid E.coli, he added.Chipotle food scares last year include two E.coli outbreaks linked to its restaurants that sickened more than 50 people in 10 states, as well as separate outbreaks of norovirus, a highly contagious virus known as the ""winter vomiting bug"", in Massachusetts and California that involved more than 350 diners. Three employees are suspected to have norovirus in Billerica, the town's Board of Health said. Earlier in the day, local Public Health Director Richard Berube told reporters that one of the three had been confirmed to have the virus.Berube said Chipotle has been ""very proactive"" and remaining staff at the burrito restaurant would be screened for norovirus, he added.Berube, the company and the Massachusetts Department of Public Health all said no customers were known to be sick.""They did the right thing,"" said Howard Penney, who covers the chain for Hedgeye Risk Management. However, he argued that Chipotle was still a ""broken company"" and that it would take years to return to its peak performance.

174,"   By Brian Snyder and Lisa Baertlein | BILLERICA, Mass./LOS ANGELES  BILLERICA, Mass./LOS ANGELES Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc received praise for its handling of potential norovirus infections at a Boston-area restaurant, as sick employees stayed home and the burrito chain quickly cleaned the restaurant.Shares of Chipotle fell as much as 6.1 percent early, then gained back some ground after the head of the Billerica, Massachusetts public health department said the restaurant was cleaned and would reopen on Thursday. The stock closed down 3.4 percent at $506.63.The closure of the Chipotle in the Boston suburb was seen as a partial test of a new food safety system rolled out after a series of illnesses hit the fresh burrito chain last year. That workers stayed home in particular was a good sign, said Doug Powell, publisher of the food safety site barfblog.com. ""It is an indication that the system is working,"" he said. But customers may focus only on the sickness, not the company response. For burrito fans, ""It's just - ooh, they're barfing at Chipotle again,"" Powell said.The company response was not a test of new measures to ensure ingredients are safe and avoid E.coli, he added.Chipotle food scares last year include two E.coli outbreaks linked to its restaurants that sickened more than 50 people in 10 states, as well as separate outbreaks of norovirus, a highly contagious virus known as the ""winter vomiting bug"", in Massachusetts and California that involved more than 350 diners. Three employees are suspected to have norovirus in Billerica, the town's Board of Health said. Earlier in the day, local Public Health Director Richard Berube told reporters that one of the three had been confirmed to have the virus.Berube said Chipotle has been ""very proactive"" and remaining staff at the burrito restaurant would be screened for norovirus, he added.Berube, the company and the Massachusetts Department of Public Health all said no customers were known to be sick.""They did the right thing,"" said Howard Penney, who covers the chain for Hedgeye Risk Management. However, he argued that Chipotle was still a ""broken company"" and that it would take years to return to its peak performance.

Restaurant-level operating margin was 19.6 for the fourth quarter.Chipotle sharply increased giveaways in February, mailing and texting coupons for free burritos.

179,"   By Lisa Baertlein | LOS ANGELES  LOS ANGELES Cesar Trejo broke his Chipotle habit after the chain's string of food safety lapses last year. This week, a free food offer lured him back, along with the urging of three friends who had returned without getting sick.""I saw all the news. I thought, 'I have to wait',"" said Trejo, 32. He used to eat at Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG.N) outlet near his job in downtown Los Angeles two to three times a week, until highly publicized reports linking the burrito seller to E. coli, salmonella and norovirus outbreaks scared him off.And wait he did. Monday marked the first time in three months that Trejo had set foot in Chipotle. He paid for a drink and used a coupon to get a free steak burrito bowl at the restaurant, which was relatively quiet during the lunch rush. Free food is the backbone of Chipotle's strategy to lure back Trejo and other ""top loyal"" customers, who dine at the chain at least 25 times a year and account for up to 20 percent of its sales.ITG Investment Research analyst Joe Fersedi said free food coupon redemptions appeared to spike in the second week of February. That was when credit card transactions under $4, which would be the cost of a free entree with a paid drink or chips, briefly topped 10 percent before returning to their historical level of around 2 percent in late February, said Fersedi. ""We have to wait to see if management turns on the 'promotion spigot' again,"" following last week's brief closure of a Massachusetts restaurant due to sick employees, Fersedi said.  Chipotle has not said how many burritos it has given away and one analyst said its ""unprecedented"" food giveaways are training diners to wait for more freebies.""Discounting and couponing is a drug. Consumers get addicted to it and it's all they want,"" said Howard Penney, who covers Chipotle for Hedgeye Risk Management.  Chipotle on Tuesday said February sales at established restaurants fell a steeper-than-expected 26 percent following a 36 percent drop in January. [L3N16N55Y]Those sales were down more than 27 percent in March due to  the closure of its restaurant in the Boston suburb of Billerica,  Chipotle said in a regulatory filing.

That said, paid transactions are 30 percent lower, executives said. The Pacific Northwest and the Northeast, which were most affected by 2015's food poisoning outbreaks, have been the slowest to recover. The company is also sending coupons to mobile phones and other devices. Redemption rates for those are significantly higher, at 67 percent.

187,"   By Lisa Baertlein | LOS ANGELES  LOS ANGELES Cesar Trejo broke his Chipotle habit after the chain's string of food safety lapses last year. This week, a free food offer lured him back, along with the urging of three friends who had returned without getting sick.""I saw all the news. I thought, 'I have to wait',"" said Trejo, 32. He used to eat at Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG.N) outlet near his job in downtown Los Angeles two to three times a week, until highly publicized reports linking the burrito seller to E. coli, salmonella and norovirus outbreaks scared him off.And wait he did. Monday marked the first time in three months that Trejo had set foot in Chipotle. He paid for a drink and used a coupon to get a free steak burrito bowl at the restaurant, which was relatively quiet during the lunch rush. Free food is the backbone of Chipotle's strategy to lure back Trejo and other ""top loyal"" customers, who dine at the chain at least 25 times a year and account for up to 20 percent of its sales.ITG Investment Research analyst Joe Fersedi said free food coupon redemptions appeared to spike in the second week of February. That was when credit card transactions under $4, which would be the cost of a free entree with a paid drink or chips, briefly topped 10 percent before returning to their historical level of around 2 percent in late February, said Fersedi. ""We have to wait to see if management turns on the 'promotion spigot' again,"" following last week's brief closure of a Massachusetts restaurant due to sick employees, Fersedi said.  Chipotle has not said how many burritos it has given away and one analyst said its ""unprecedented"" food giveaways are training diners to wait for more freebies.""Discounting and couponing is a drug. Consumers get addicted to it and it's all they want,"" said Howard Penney, who covers Chipotle for Hedgeye Risk Management.  Chipotle on Tuesday said February sales at established restaurants fell a steeper-than-expected 26 percent following a 36 percent drop in January. [L3N16N55Y]Those sales were down more than 27 percent in March due to  the closure of its restaurant in the Boston suburb of Billerica,  Chipotle said in a regulatory filing. Give a loyal customer a free burrito that does not make her sick and she'll come back again and tell friends to do the same, said Tushar Parashar, marketing strategist at Vivaldi Partners Group.""People who are seriously loyal are easy to win over,"" Parashar said. Casual customers concerned about a brand's health and hygiene are not so easy. ""A free burrito is not enough to get you to come back,"" Parashar said.""Chipotle needs months and months of clean bills of health before they put this in their rear view mirror,"" said Ashley McCown, president of Solomon McCown & Co, a crisis communications expert.

202,"   By Lisa Baertlein | LOS ANGELES  LOS ANGELES In its struggle to win back customers after last year's food safety issues, Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc is embracing  strategies it once rejected.    Executives at the formerly high-flying burrito chain announced plans this week to expand its menu, explore a loyalty program, spend heavily on traditional advertising and potentially put the brakes on some new restaurant deals - moves embraced by its competitors but not previously by Chipotle.    Successful brands such as Starbucks Corp and Panera Bread Co used similar strategies after they saw slowdowns in once robust sales.     ""Chipotle is just falling in line with the way the rest of the industry operates,"" said Darren Tristano, president of food service consulting firm Technomic.    After years of breakneck growth, now ""Chipotle is just your average restaurant company,"" said Hedgeye Risk Management restaurant analyst Howard Penney.     Before Chipotle was tied to E. coli, salmonella and norovirus outbreaks last year, it could raise prices with little to no pushback from diners. It also kept finding new ways to squeeze more sales and profits from its restaurants, fueling outsized share gains.    This week the chain posted its first-ever quarterly loss as millions of dollars in free food giveaways failed to lure back enough paying customers to satisfy Wall Street.     Shares are trading down more than 40 percent from their all-time high of over $742 on July 1.     Chipotle executives appear willing to step outside their comfort zone to fix what ails the chain, ""but we also question whether (Chipotle) will ever regain its lost luster,"" Deutsche Bank analyst Brett Levy said in a note.     The company plans to put chorizo on the menu, only its second protein addition in more than 20 years, and will experiment with loyalty programs, something it once dismissed as unnecessary discounts for frequent customers.     Chipotle is also investing heavily in traditional advertising focused on food quality, a major shift from is former dependence on offbeat marketing projects, such as quirky short promotional films.     After adding about 200 restaurants annually in recent years, Chipotle is now carefully reviewing new restaurant projects it had previously green-lighted, co-Chief Executive Monty Moran said.        ""We might walk away from some of those deals,"" Moran said on an earnings conference call on Tuesday.

203,"   By Tom Polansek | CHICAGO  CHICAGO The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has pushed back against complaints from Chipotle Mexican Grill that the health agency misinformed the public with its reporting of certain E. coli cases linked to the burrito chain.The federal regulators' defense of its actions comes as the burrito chain has revamped its food safety strategy to recover from a string of 2015 food safety lapses that have scared away customers and battered the company's formerly high-flying shares.

While the entire board was reelected, three members received unusually low numbers of votes.The New York City Pension Funds, which sponsored the successful proxy access proposal, had predicted that the vote would be a referendum on Chipotle's board.""Today's vote serves as a wake-up call for a board that urgently needs to restore investor confidence in the wake of costly risk oversight failures,"" Scott Stringer, investment adviser at the proposal's sponsor, the New York City Pension Funds, said in a statement.Those failures include a lack of response to early red flags on food safety, his office said. The proposal received 57 percent of votes cast, according to Reuters' calculations from  results in a Chipotle regulatory filing. A counterproposal by Chipotle that would have required a 5-percent ownership threshold failed with about 24 percent of votes in support.Company spokesman Chris Arnold said, ""We have a history of taking action in response to the outcome of shareholder votes, and I don't expect this will be any different."" He did not immediately clarify what action the company might now take. Several major pension funds supported the measure this year, including the California Public Employee Retirement System, which helped Stringer drum up investor support.Stringer has pushed through similar measures at other companies and made a similar proposal last year at Chipotle, citing what the fund saw as excessive executive compensation. That 2015 proposal failed after falling just short of winning majority support.

209,"  (Removes extraneous word from headline)By Lisa BaertleinLOS ANGELES May 10 Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc's  board members will be in the hot seat at the burrito chain's annual meeting on Wednesday, as shareholders fight to shake up the board after a string of food safety failures last year.Chipotle shares are down about 30 percent since October, when the company closed restaurants in the Pacific Northwest due to an E. coli outbreak. That news sparked intense scrutiny of other 2015 Chipotle-linked E. coli, salmonella and norovirus outbreaks, scaring away customers and sparking a federal criminal investigation.With that in mind, investors are weighing a New York City Pension Funds proposal that would allow an investor or group of investors owning 3 percent or more of the company's outstanding shares continuously for three years to nominate directors to the board.""Wednesday's vote on our proxy access proposal will serve as a referendum on this entrenched and unresponsive board,"" New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer, investment advisor and trustee of the NYC Pension Funds, said in a statement. Chipotle is running a counter proposal that would set the threshold at 5 percent.This is the second year in a row that the two sides have faced off over so-called proxy access. In 2015, the shareholder proposal fell just short of a majority, faring far better than the company's version. Proxy advisory firms Institutional Shareholder Services Inc (ISS) and Glass Lewis have recommended voting for the shareholder proposal and against Chipotle's version.Shareholder CtW Investment Group has separately called on fellow investors to vote against long-time board members Patrick Flynn and Darlene Friedman, saying the chain's recent food safety crisis shows the company needs a board that is more independent and diverse.ISS recommended votes against Flynn and audit committee chair Albert Baldocchi, given that committee's ""failure to provide sufficient oversight of food safety risk.""

210,"   By Lisa Baertlein, Tom Polansek and Julie Steenhuysen  Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG.N) has retained two leading food safety experts - including a critic of the burrito chain's early response to disease outbreaks last year - as it redoubles its efforts to guard against health scares.David Acheson, a former official at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the U.S. Department of Agriculture, was brought on as an adviser, Chipotle told Reuters.The company also confirmed it is working with David Theno, a food safety consultant and former Jack in the Box executive who is credited with fixing food safety at the fast-food chain following a deadly E. coli outbreak in the 1990s.The two are respected among food safety experts, and their involvement may signal an expansion in Chipotle's reforms. But the scope is not yet clear.Spokesman Chris Arnold confirmed the consultants were retained last year but would not say when or detail their duties. As recently as early December, Acheson was sharply critical of the company's initial response to the outbreaks.In March, the company announced it had hired James Marsden, a former meat science professor at Kansas State University, as executive director of food safety. Arnold said Marsden would have ""primary responsibility for our food safety programs.""Expanding its complement of food safety experts is part of Chipotle's effort to rebound from a spate of disease outbreaks - including E. coli, salmonella and norovirus - last year that crushed sales, repulsed customers and slashed $6 billion off its market valuation.Chipotle's ability to win back diners is vital to reviving sales and is expected to be a key topic at the company’s annual meeting on Wednesday. ""We have committed to establishing Chipotle as an industry leader in food safety, and we have assembled an extremely capable team to help us achieve that goal,"" Arnold told Reuters.Chipotle declined to make members of the team available for for interviews.""If I had to put together a dream team to fix something, you could do a lot worse,” said Don Schaffner, a food science professor at Rutgers University. But, he added: ""I’ve begun to wonder a little bit about too many cooks. Each of those guys is going to have a perspective on what to do to fix the problem.""Michael Doyle, director of the Center for Food Safety at the University of Georgia, said he expected the group's focus ""would likely be more on food safety preventive controls and less on food testing."" Chipotle's initial response emphasized testing ingredients for pathogens with the goal of stopping any source of illness from getting into its restaurants. The company touted a testing regime set up by another consultant, Mansour Samadpour, chief executive of IEH Laboratories & Consulting Group.Acheson criticized the Chipotle for relying too heavily on that one approach. ""I'm not a believer that you can test your way to safety,” he told Reuters in early December. At the time, he said the focus should be on improving food  sourcing and handling practices, including how suppliers are approved, “how they are leveraged in terms of training, storing, handling, and preparing of food.""Arnold said Chipotle continues to work with the IEH testing firm. Its more recent changes have focused on food preparation. For instance, Chipotle said on its latest earnings call that it had started blanching bell peppers in an effort to kill germs. The chain also has cut some small suppliers. Kenter Canyon Farms said it lost business providing oregano to Chipotle through a third-party distributor.“When that whole scandal happened with the E. coli, when they revamped their food safety. They cut ties with a lot of growers,” said Mark Lopez, sales director for the farm.Chipotle also began buying more red onions from Oregon-based River Point Farms, which said it is the country’s largest onion supplier, a source involved in the situation said. The goal was to make it easier for Chipotle to trace the origins of the products, according to the source, who did not want to be identified. River Point declined to comment.Chipotle's Arnold said the chain would continue to support smaller farms, and has committed to spending $10 million to help them meet its standards. But he said the company has noted that it may be difficult for ""some of our smaller suppliers to meet our heightened food safety standards.""Big chains - including Yum Brands Inc (YUM.N), the parent of Taco Bell and KFC, and McDonald's Corp - tend to work with a small number of large suppliers, which often have more resources and controls.

Contrafund, the largest mutual fund investor in Chipotle, reported owning 1.37 million shares at the end of April, compared with 1.74 million a month earlier, according to the fund's latest holdings disclosure, posted on May 29.Chipotle shares have fallen 39 percent since the end of September.

213,"   By Noel Randewich | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Shares of Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG.N) appear expensive as Wall Street awaits fresh data on the burrito chain's struggle to recover from a string of food-borne illness outbreaks. Sales data for May, which analysts believe the company might release in the next several days, could provide evidence of whether two-for-one deals are successfully luring customers back after Chipotle posted its first-ever loss in the first quarter.Its same-restaurant sales may have fallen 20 percent year-on-year in May, according to the consensus of analyst estimates tracked by Thomson Reuters. Chipotle does not normally provide mid-quarter updates, but it has done so occasionally in recent months in order to increase transparency around the crisis.Shares of Chipotle have dropped 40 percent since August after norovirus and E.coli outbreaks at some of its outlets led to a plunge in sales for the company, which markets its burritos and tacos as healthier than rivals' food. Estimates for Chipotle's earnings per share for this year have fallen much further than its stock price. Wall Street has slashed its average earnings estimate for 2016 to $4.81 per share from over $20 before the food safety crisis, according to Thomson Reuters data.  Chipotle's stock is now trading near 55 times the next 12 months' expected earnings, its priciest multiple since just after the Wall Street favorite listed its stock a decade ago. But with investors viewing 2016 as a near write-off for Chipotle because of the food contamination crisis, many are focusing on earnings expectations for next year, when profits  are seen rebounding to $11.86 per share. Based on that figure, Chipotle's stock is trading at a less stratospheric PE of 35, suggesting Wall Street is optimistic about the speed of the company's recovery.""We're debating visibility of the next month, let alone next year,"" said Cowen and Company analyst Andrew Charles. ""But we think they're going to move more toward normalized earnings as time progresses, and time will help heal the wounds.""Still, a federal criminal investigation, a potential rebound in commodity prices and rising minimum wages are major threats to Chipotle's future earnings potential, cautions Maxim analyst Stephen Anderson. Chipotle's stock has lost 6 percent since its disappointing first-quarter report on April 26. On Thursday it fell 2.52 percent to $418.36.Only a few restaurants' shares trade at PE multiples greater than Chipotle's. They include Shake Shack (SHAK.N) at 78, Zoe's Kitchen (ZOES.N) at 210 and Noodles & Co (NDLS.O) at 125, according to Thomson Reuters data.

222,"   By Sruthi Ramakrishnan  Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (CMG.N) reported a bigger-than-expected drop in quarterly comparable sales as food giveaways and enhanced safety measures failed to bring back diners shaken by a string of food-borne illnesses last year.The restaurant chain has given away millions of free burritos and other menu items such as guacamole and chips to revive sales growth after outbreaks of E. coli, salmonella and norovirus linked to its outlets put off customers.The company also launched its first-ever loyalty program in July and added chorizo, a spicy chicken and pork sausage, to its menu.In a sign the efforts may be starting to pay off, Chipotle reported an uptick in comparable sales in July.Still, shares were down 2.1 percent in volatile after-market trading on Thursday as investors focused on the slow pace of recovery.Profit for the second quarter ended June 30 slumped 82 percent, while sales were down 16.6 percent. ""While it has only been a few weeks since Chiptopia (loyalty program) launched, we are pleased to see that July sales comp trends have already improved by 200 to 300 basis points,"" Co-CEO Steve Ells said.Analysts, however, said it was too early to conclude that a sales recovery was underway.""I still think they have a long way to go ... don't think they have anything to cheer about,"" Maxim Group analyst Stephen Anderson said, adding there was little visibility into the next few quarters. Company executives said on a post-earnings call that it was very likely that Chipotle would launch a new loyalty program after ""Chiptopia"" ends in September.The company's net income slumped to $25.6 million, or 87 cents per share, in the second quarter ended June 30, from $140.2 million, or $4.45 per share, a year earlier.Sales at restaurants open at least 13 months fell 23.6 percent, more than the 20.6 percent drop expected on average by analysts polled by research firm Consensus Metrix. Revenue fell 16.6 percent to $998.4 million, down for the third straight quarter.Analysts on average had expected earnings of 93 cents per share on revenue of $1.05 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.The stock has lost more than a third of its value since food safety woes surfaced in October that led to the closure of dozens of Chipotle's restaurants.

229,"   By Caroline Valetkevitch  U.S. stocks ended little changed on Wednesday, though the Nasdaq eked out another record high close, as investors assessed the outlook for U.S. interest rates.A disappointing forecast from Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM.O) weighed on grocers. Sprouts shares were down 13.7  percent at $19.68, while Whole Foods (WFM.O) shares fell 5.3 percent to $29.08 and Kroger (KR.N) shares dropped 4.1 percent to $31.32.Investors have been weighing the likelihood of a rate hike this month from the Federal Reserve, with recent economic data including last Friday's weaker-than-expected jobs report suggesting the U.S. central bank could hold off for now.The Fed said on Wednesday afternoon in its Beige Book report of anecdotal information that the U.S. economy expanded at a modest pace in July and August, but there was little sign that wage pressures are being felt beyond highly skilled jobs.""Follow-through from last week's OK-but-not-tremendous employment number is sending the lower-for-longer interest rate message out there to people coming back from vacation,"" said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia.

231,"   By Subrat Patnaik  Activist investor William Ackman, wielding a stake of nearly 10 percent in Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (CMG.N), is likely to push for board changes and a franchising model, analysts said, as the fast-casual Mexican food chain struggles to win back customers.Ackman, whose Pershing Square Holdings oversees $12 billion for pension funds and other wealthy investors, is known for shaking up boards and trying to guide turnarounds.But he has had limited success with his investments in recent times. Pershing Square lost 20.5 percent in 2015, and was down 14.3 percent this year as of the end of August.Ackman is the largest shareholder in embattled Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc (VRX.TO) (VRX.N) and has a $1 billion short position in nutritional supplement maker Herbalife Ltd (HLF.N) that has so far proved unprofitable.Nomura analyst Mark Kalinowski is among analysts who expect Ackman to push for board changes at Chipotle, which was hit by E. coli, salmonella and norovirus outbreaks last year and has yet to fully recover.    Kalinowski said ""meaningful new blood"" was needed on the Chipotle board, which has come under fire for having served too long and for being too close to management. Ackman might pressure Chipotle to ""franchise outlets to drive unit growth and increase shareholder returns,"" Maxim Group analyst Stephen Anderson said in a note.     McDonald's Corp (MCD.N), Yum Brands Inc's (YUM.N) Pizza Hut and KFC, and Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) have embraced the franchising model to expand.However, Morgan Stanley analyst John Glass noted that  Chipotle had no existing franchisee base on which to build.Chipotle's shares were up 5.3 percent at $435.07 in early trading on Wednesday. Up to Tuesday's close, the stock had tumbled more than 42 percent in the last 12 months.The company's revenue has fallen for three straight quarters. Denver-based Chipotle has invested heavily to try to draw back customers, increasing food safety measures and offering free burritos and other menu items such as guacamole and chips.""We see no quick fix to what CMG really needs - a revitalization of top line,"" Glass wrote in a note.With the stake in Chipotle, Ackman is betting on a sector where he has seen success before. He previously made successful bets on Burger King and McDonalds and remains an investor in Restaurant Brands International (QSR.TO), the company that resulted from the merger of Burger King and Canada's Tim Horton's.However, analysts said Chipotle did not have the issues that activist investors typically deal with.""There is no real estate to sell or significant non-core assets to sell,"" said Howard Penney, who covers Chipotle for Hedgeye Risk Management.Twelve of 37 brokerages rate Chipotle a ""buy"" or higher, 19 ""hold"" and 6 ""sell"" or lower.

234,"   By Tom Polansek | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Chipotle Mexican Grill has agreed to financial settlements with more than 100 customers who fell ill after eating at its restaurants last year, lawyers for the consumers said, as it attempts to move on from a string of food-safety problems.The burrito chain's strategy of resolving claims out of court, which has not previously been reported, shows it wants to avoid drawn-out public battles over foodborne illnesses that battered the company's stock price and reputation.Terms of Chipotle's settlements with customers were confidential, lawyers representing them said this week.Chipotle has been working to revive sales growth after outbreaks of E. coli, norovirus and salmonella linked to its restaurants sickened more than 500 people last year and drove away customers.On Tuesday, activist investor William Ackman disclosed that his hedge fund had purchased a 9.9 percent stake in the company, saying it was undervalued. When asked about reported settlements, Chipotle spokesman Chris Arnold said the company ""does right by our customers and simply wanted to make things right for people who were affected by any of those incidents.""

237,"   By Julia Love and Alexandria Sage | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Apple Inc (AAPL.O) unveiled an iPhone 7 with high-resolution cameras and no headphone jack at its annual launch event Wednesday, though the biggest surprise was the debut of a three-decade-old Nintendo game franchise, Super Mario Bros, on the smartphone.While shares of Apple barely budged, Nintendo's (7974.T) U.S.-listed shares jumped 29 pct on investors' hopes that Super Mario would be another mobile gaming hit for the Japanese company akin to the wildly popular Pokemon Go.Much of the presentation headed by Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook was devoted to technical details of photography, wireless earphones, games from Nintendo, and a new version of Apple watch - with fitness features.The biggest iPhone technical improvements all had leaked, and Apple itself spoiled the surprise by sending out tweets of some details before Cook spoke. The company then deleted the messages.Apple has reported declines in iPhone sales for the last two quarters, which raised the stakes for the iPhone 7. Some consumers and analysts are considering waiting until 2017.“Just gonna wait on iPhone 8 cuz it’s the 10th anniversary of iPhone,” Tweeted @LewBruh near the end of the event. “Ya know they gonna do something big.”But Mike Binger, senior portfolio manager at Gradient Investments LLC in Minneapolis, said the new phone encouraged him that Apple was in good shape for a new sales cycle.""I think the iPhone 7, just from a replacement basis, will be a successful launch,"" he said.  The world's best-known technology company said the iPhone 7 would have one, zooming 12-megapixel camera. Starting at $649, it is the same price as the 6S predecessor. The larger 7 'Plus' edition, starting at $769, would feature two cameras, including a telephoto lens.Apple also removed the analog headphone jack from both new models, as was widely expected. The new headphones supplied by Apple with the phone will plug into the same port as the recharging cord, making it incompatible with most wired headphones without an adaptor. Apple includes the adapter.The phones will also work with Apple's new wireless headphones, called Air Pods, available in late October at a price of $159.The disappearance of the headphone jack “will probably annoy a certain amount of people” but they would likely get over it, Binger said. Apple described dropping the jack as an act of courage as it moved toward a wireless future with the optional Air Pods. Getting rid of the jack also increased room for stereo speakers, and Apple sharpened the technology on most features, from the camera to a pressure-sensitive home button to a boost in memory.The new phone will start shipping in major markets, including the United States and China, on Sept. 16. Bob O'Donnell of research firm TECHnalysis said Apple's new glossy black finish could be more popular than any tech feature, reflecting the slowdown in major tech innovations for smartphones.""While the camera improvements for the iPhone 7 Plus are nice, they are incremental for most and the lack of headphone jacks could offset that for others,"" he said.  Apple typically gives its main product, which accounts for more than half of its revenue, a big makeover every other year and the last major redesign was the iPhone 6 in 2014. Many are expecting a three-year cycle this time, culminating in a major redesign for 2017 to be called iPhone 8.Apple said its Apple Watch Series 2, with a swim-proof casing, will be available in more than 25 countries starting on Sept. 16.""I predict Watch sales will improve dramatically,"" said Tech analyst Patrick Moorhead. ""Most of the current Watch owners are early adopters and the next wave could be 10 times the size of that market.""    Apple also launched a new version of the device called the Apple Watch Nike+, in partnership with the athletic goods manufacturer Nike Inc (NKE.N), featuring GPS so athletes can track their runs. Shares of Fitbit Inc (FIT.N), which makes activity-tracking bands, closed down 2 percent on the emergence of such a high-profile competitor.

238,"   By Tom Polansek | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Consumer opinions of Chipotle Mexican Grill have slid in recent weeks on food safety concerns, pollster YouGov BrandIndex said on Wednesday, a move that hurts the burrito chain's efforts to recover from a string of foodborne illnesses last year.The YouGov data, requested by Reuters, shows that perceptions about Chipotle's quality on Tuesday returned to levels last seen in early August. Before the latest survey, brand perceptions had nosed into positive territory for the first time since last year.The survey was carried out the same day investor William Ackman disclosed after the market close that his hedge fund had purchased a 9.9 percent stake in Chipotle, buying in after the once high-flying company was battered by food-safety issues.""For at least some consumers, the outbreaks from last year still resonate and for those consumers, eating in a Chipotle even today is not worth the risk,"" said Ted Marzilli, YouGov BrandIndex's chief executive officer.Chipotle has given away millions of free burritos and other menu items, including guacamole and chips, to revive sales growth after outbreaks of E. coli, salmonella and norovirus linked to its outlets last year put off customers.  In July, the company reported an uptick in comparable sales for the month but said it had a bigger-than-expected drop in such sales in the quarter ended June 30.Ackman's fund said in a regulatory filing that Chipotle was undervalued.Chipotle's own research on consumer perceptions shows ""the overall trend is moving in the right direction,"" a spokesman said. ""Week-to-week fluctuations will always occur, but we tend to focus on longer-term trends,"" he said. YouGov said it interviews 4,800 people each weekday in the United States for its polls, with participants drawn from an online panel of more than 1.8 million people. On Tuesday, 4.5 percent more people said they had a negative rather than positive perception of Chipotle's brand, according to its data.  Consumer opinions dropped in the last quarter of 2015, with 31.2 percent more people saying in late December that they had a negative rather than positive perception of Chipotle's brand, according to YouGov.Brand perceptions have since improved steadily but remain below last summer, prior to the food-safety problems.Regarding quality, 4.8 percent more people said they felt positive rather than negative about Chipotle on Tuesday, according to YouGov. That was down from about 9 percent on Aug. 23 and from more than 20 percent a year earlier.

240,"   By Svea Herbst-Bayliss | BOSTON  BOSTON Activist investor William Ackman is hungry to repair Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG.N) after taking a stake in the burrito chain and could begin by shaking up a long-serving board and possibly replacing the two co-chief executives, analysts and investors said.Chipotle is struggling to revive sales after food-borne illness outbreaks and its share price is down nearly 40 percent in the last year. Ackman, who made his reputation by ousting what he considers underperforming board members and executives, in a filing on Tuesday called Chipotle shares undervalued and said he would speak with management but did not lay out  specific next steps. ""Ackman tends to come in forcefully and now everyone on the board, including the two CEOs, is under reconsideration,"" said Dieter Waizenegger, executive director of CtW Investment Group which works with union-sponsored pension funds that invest in Chipotle. Chipotle shares rose 5.9 percent to $438.45 on Wednesday, a day after Ackman's Pershing Square hedge fund disclosed a 9.9 percent stake in the chain. Ackman has helped force out Fred Green as CEO at Canadian Pacific and John McGlade as CEO at Air Products.Outside of personnel changes, Wall Street analysts say the usual activist game plan for revitalizing a restaurant chain, such as refranchising stores, is likely not in play. ""(Chipotle) has no existing franchise base to use to rekindle this, and there are significant risks to culture and execution,"" analysts at Morgan Stanley said in a research note. Instead, fund managers and analysts want the company to recapture its reputation for serving healthy food through quality control changes.  Chipotle ""begged for an activist to go in,"" said Waizenegger, citing its depressed stock price and chummy board.""The presence of a large and vocal investor may provide management with more incentive to hasten their turnaround efforts, which appear to have stalled,"" the Morgan Stanley analysts wrote.A Chipotle spokesman said on Wednesday that the chain has held its first call with Ackman and expects to meet with him soon. For Ackman, the investment in Chipotle takes him back to his wheelhouse of investing in fast food restaurants after he made money at McDonald's and Burger King. He also could have allies in Vanguard Group, the largest U.S. mutual fund company, which held a 9 percent stake in Chipotle at the end of June.  LEADERSHIP IN FOCUS Industry analysts expect Ackman will likely focus on helping revamp Chipotle's board, which has come under fire from shareholders for having served too long, lacking relevant skills and being too chummy with top management.At Chipotle, board members have served for an average 13 years, far longer than the average 8.5 years board members serve on S&P 500 companies, according to executive recruiting firm Spencer Stuart.Chipotle shares in June sank to their lowest level in three years following a bearish report from a Deutsche Bank analyst. And there is waning confidence in Chipotle's leadership in some quarters.  Sales at restaurants open at least 13 months fell 23.6 percent in the quarter ending June 30. The company said when it reported quarterly results on July 21 that comparable sales trends in July had improved by 200 to 300 basis points. ""Importantly, management has struggled to demonstrate a proven strategy,"" analysts at Barclays said in a Tuesday research note. ""Without a full sales recovery, we believe unit growth, restaurant margins, and ultimately EPS growth will remain tempered.""     Vanguard, in a rare move, this year voted against the pay package for Chipotle co-CEOs Steve Ells and Monty Moran. Their combined compensation was $27.4 million in 2015. CtW's Waizenegger said he would like to see the two executives have more stock ownership in the company. Vanguard was not immediately available to comment. In 2015, Ells and Moran realized a combined $154.4 million from exercising stock options, according to Chipotle’s proxy statement.Some things Ackman could pressure the company to work on include beefing up its expertise in marketing, cost control and information technology, industry analysts said.In their latest round of commentary letters to investors, several U.S. mutual fund managers said they believed Chipotle would get back on track with customers. The Fidelity Blue Chip Growth Fund, which owned $286.4 million worth of Chipotle stock at the end of July, said it remained ""cautiously optimistic"" on Chipotle and added slightly to the fund's position in the second quarter.

Run by portfolio manager Will Danoff, Contrafund reported holding about 790,177 shares in Chipotle at the end of August. That was down from about 980,000 shares in the previous month, according to Fidelity fund disclosures. Fidelity was not immediately available for comment.  Contrafund's reduced exposure comes as activist investor Bill Ackman works to revive the chain's sales. Earlier this month, Ackman's Pershing Square hedge fund disclosed a 9.9 percent stake in Chipotle.     Since the end of 2015 when Contrafund held about 1.95 million Chipotle shares worth $934 million, Danoff has cut the stake by 59 percent.  Chipotle is struggling to revive sales after food-borne illness outbreaks hit the chain. Its share price is down 41 percent in the past year, trading up 1.2 percent on Friday afternoon at $425.74.

249,"   By Lisa Baertlein  Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (CMG.N) on Tuesday reported a bigger-than-expected drop in quarterly sales at established restaurants as it fights to recover from a string of food safety lapses late last year.Shares in Chipotle fell 2.2 percent to $396.84 after the Denver-based burrito seller posted a 21.9 percent drop in third-quarter sales at restaurants open at least 13 months. That was steeper than the 18.7 percent decline expected by analysts polled by tracking firm Consensus Metrix.  While the company said it expects same-restaurant sales to fall again in the fourth quarter, it does expect them to grow in the ""high single digit"" percentages for all of 2017.Executives, who have depended on free and discounted food to lure back diners, laid out plans to rebuild sales and profits by improving service, debuting new technology and introducing new menu items. Analysts, who noted that sales declines are easing, took a wait-and-see stance on that news. ""There are still a lot of questions in the air,"" Stephens Inc analyst Will Slabaugh told Reuters.Chipotle's projects include a new ordering app, in-restaurant tablets, online ordering and payment for catering, and faster food preparation lines. Executives hope such efforts will deliver swifter, more accurate service without increasing labor costs.Chipotle added spicy chorizo sausage to U.S. menus this month, and executives said the chain's new offerings may include dessert.    ""These improvements are very gradual and do not provide any indication that Chipotle will return to full financial health at any time in the near future,"" Håkon Helgesen, retail analyst at Conlumino, said in an email.  Chipotle's third-quarter net profit fell to $7.8 million, or 27 cents per share, due to the chain's slow sales recovery, discounting and other charges. It reported net profit of $144.9 million, or $4.59 cents per share, a year earlier. The profit results from the latest quarter included a $14.5 million non-cash pretax impairment charge related to Chipotle's  15-unit ShopHouse Asian-themed chain, which is being put up for sale after missing internal targets.The company, which is also planning national television advertising, will open fewer restaurants. It forecast 195 to 210 restaurant openings for 2017, down from 220 to 235 expected this year.Chipotle's stock has lost about one-third of its value since food safety woes led to the temporary closure of dozens of Chipotle restaurants across the United States last year.

Chipotle has also hired crisis public relations firm Joele Frank, they added.    Neither Ackman nor his New York-based hedge fund, Pershing Square Capital Management LP, have publicly made any demands of Chipotle after becoming its second-largest shareholder last month.Billionaire Ackman is known for buying stakes in publicly traded companies and trying to force changes ranging from removing board members to selling off large parts of the company. The sources asked not to be identified because the assignments are not public. Wachtell and Chipotle did not return calls seeking comment, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and Joele Frank declined to comment on Thursday.

Chipotle is struggling to revive sales after a string of food borne illness outbreaks last year sent its shares tumbling. As a result, Chipotle on Tuesday posted another dismal quarterly earnings performance. Executives have vowed to make the chain leaner and more efficient. They have laid out plans for long-overdue investments in digital ordering and payments, deeper cost cuts, and said they would pursue strategic alternatives for its 15-unit ShopHouse Southeast Asian Kitchen chain. Chipotle in September said it welcomed Pershing Square's investment and appreciated its confidence in the company.Since then, Pershing Square and Chipotle have met at least once and have had telephone conversations, two people familiar with the matter said. They declined to discuss what the two sides have said to each other.

259,"   By Svea Herbst-Bayliss and Lisa Baertlein | BOSTON/LOS ANGELES  BOSTON/LOS ANGELESBillionaire investor William Ackman and Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG.N) have signed an agreement to engage in confidential discussions, a source familiar with the matter said, in a sign that the activist may be able to force change at the burrito chain without a costly and drawn-out proxy contest.Ackman, who took a nearly 10 percent stake in the beleaguered fast casual food chain two months ago and has not disclosed his strategy, wants multiple board seats with the aim of beefing up food safety and marketing, three people familiar with the matter said this week. Chipotle declined to comment on discussions with specific shareholders, but said it was committed to dialogue with investors including its largest shareholders and that it has been ""actively working on board refreshment."" A spokesman for Ackman's firm, Pershing Square Capital Management, declined to comment.The signing of the confidentiality agreement does not guarantee that a deal can be reached or is near, but it is a sign of a potential negotiated settlement between a board that has defended its founder-led management and an activist known for public, acrimonious fights. Chipotle shares have dropped 40 percent since a series of food borne illness outbreaks were linked to the chain in late 2015 and led to temporary restaurant closures across the United States. Sales have yet to recover to levels seen before the food safety incidents jolted confidence in the formerly top-performing restaurant operator. Chipotle recently hired a top Wall Street law firm, investment banks and a public relations shop to help defend itself against the hedge fund billionaire, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.The company's board has long been under fire from pension funds and other shareholders for being too insular, for the level of executive compensation, and for a handful of members having served more than 15 years. This week investors Amalgamated Bank and CtW urged shareholders to name an independent chairman, replacing founder and co-Chief Executive Steve Ells as leader of the board. They hope to take up the issue the next annual meeting and are beginning to lobby large institutional investors like Fidelity and Vanguard, both big holders of Chipotle shares. Ackman is known for loud campaigns, including an expensive but successful fight at Canadian Pacific (CP.TO) where he won seven board seats, but more recent plays have been less noisy.Last year, a member of Ackman's investment team joined the board at animal health company Zoetis (ZTS.N) and in 2013 his firm negotiated for seats at Air Products & Chemicals (APD.N). Both happened relatively quickly and quietly. Investors in a Pershing Square investment vehicle that invested in Air Products  saw a return of 45 percent after fees over three years, according to a letter seen by Reuters.Pershing Square said Zoetis was one of three winners in its portfolio last year, adding 1.2 percent, and the stock has risen 4.2 percent so far this year. Turning around Chipotle is a critical mission for Ackman, whose Pershing Square International fund has lost roughly 17 percent this year after dropping 16 percent last year. Chipotle added Stephen Gillett, a senior executive at Google X, to its board in March 2015. That move came two months before investors approved a non-binding proposal that gives investors more power to shake up the company's board by nominating new directors.""We have been committed to shareholder engagement for a number of years, and maintain ongoing dialogue with numerous investors, including our largest shareholders,"" the company said in a statement on Friday. ""We will continue to take whatever actions are necessary to deliver on our recovery and enhance shareholder value.""

His team believes that marketing, menu, cost-saving, technology and governance initiatives will help the shares rebound from a 40 percent swoon since last year's high-profile food safety lapses.In October, Reuters reported that Chipotle had hired a top Wall Street law firm, investment banks and a public relations shop to help defend itself against the hedge fund billionaire.Ackman said such hires are standard operating procedure for companies when an activist investor buys a stake. ""Our investors should not be concerned that we're in some kind of hostile engagement here,"" Ackman said on his fund's quarterly call with investors.Chipotle's board has been criticized by pension funds and other shareholders, who say it is too chummy, too generous with  executive compensation and too entrenched, with five of its nine directors having served 18 years or more. Two union-affiliated shareholders in Chipotle earlier this month filed a shareholder resolution to replace company chairman, founder and co-Chief Executive Steve Ells, with an independent director.

His team believes that marketing, menu, cost-saving, technology and governance initiatives will help the shares rebound from a 40 percent swoon since last year's high-profile food safety lapses.In October, Reuters reported that Chipotle had hired a top Wall Street law firm, investment banks and a public relations shop to help defend itself against the hedge fund billionaire.Ackman said such hires are standard operating procedure for companies when an activist investor buys a stake. ""Our investors should not be concerned that we're in some kind of hostile engagement here,"" Ackman said on his fund's quarterly call with investors.Chipotle's board has been criticized by pension funds and other shareholders, who say it is too chummy, too generous with  executive compensation and too entrenched, with five of its nine directors having served 18 years or more. Two union-affiliated shareholders in Chipotle earlier this month filed a shareholder resolution to replace company chairman, founder and co-Chief Executive Steve Ells, with an independent director.     People familiar with Ackman's thinking have suggested that he believes Chipotle's long-serving board is due for an overhaul. Ackman and his team did not mention Chipotle's board on Thursday's call.Chipotle last week said it was committed to dialogue with investors including its largest shareholders and that it has been ""actively working on board refreshment."" Reuters last week reported that Ackman and Chipotle signed an agreement to engage in confidential discussions, a sign that the activist may be able to wield change at the chain without an expensive and time consuming proxy contest.

265,"   By Lisa Baertlein | LOS ANGELES  LOS ANGELES Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (CMG.N), amid activist pressure to revamp its board and revive sales following last year's string of food safety lapses, will ""shortly"" announce a new slate of directors, founder and co-chief executive Steve Ells said on Tuesday.Billionaire investor William Ackman, who took a nearly 10 percent stake in the burrito chain three months ago, wants several board seats with the aim of beefing up food safety and marketing, three people familiar with the matter have told Reuters.Shares in Chipotle tumbled 7.8 percent to $365.33 on Tuesday when Ells said he was nervous about meeting full-year targets.  Executives blamed poor customer service and underperforming restaurants,  particularly in the Northeastern United States, for a slower-than-expected sales recovery.Shares in Chipotle have lost 40 percent of their value since Halloween weekend 2015, when the company's food safety problems began grabbing national headlines.  Chipotle co-CEO and director Monty Moran did not join fellow executives at Tuesday's Barclays investor conference in New York, fueling speculation by investors and analysts that he may be ousted in the shakeup. Moran has been co-CEO since January 2009 and rarely misses a presentation.Moran oversees operations at Chipotle. The company's operational challenges ""make you wonder about his absence at an investor meeting,"" Hedgeye Risk Management analyst Howard Penney said. Chipotle spokesman Chris Arnold said company management has not changed.Ells said Chipotle is taking a careful look at existing directors, with an eye toward what can be strengthened. In particular, he said the company is assessing long director tenures and considering new candidates with expertise in areas such as marketing, crisis management and corporate governance.Reuters last month reported that Ackman and Chipotle had signed an agreement to engage in confidential discussions, a sign that the activist may force change at the burrito chain without a costly and drawn-out proxy contest. ""We don't have any fundamental differences about the business,"" Ells said of Ackman.Chipotle's board long has been under fire from pension funds and other shareholders for being insular, entrenched and overly generous with compensation.Chipotle investors Amalgamated Bank and CtW in November  urged shareholders to name an independent chairman to replace Ells as leader of the board.  Five of Chipotle's nine directors have served for more than 18 years. Darlene Friedman, John Charlesworth and Ells are the longest serving with more than 20 years each.(This story corrects stock symbol, paragraph 1) (Reporting by Lisa Baertlein in Los Angeles; editing by Bill Trott and Grant McCool)",2016-12-06,CMG,"Tue Dec 6, 2016 | 1:31pm EST","Chipotle says new director slate due 'shortly,' recovery lags",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-chipotle-board-idUSKBN13V1P1?type=companyNews
