0,"  * U.S. watchdog says Tesoro 2010 explosion was preventable* Watchdog says oil industry needs to toughen standard* Tesoro disagrees with several of probe's findings   (Recasts first paragraphs, adds investigator comments and no comment from Washington state agency)By Erwin SebaJan 30 A U.S. safety agency blamed Tesoro Corp.  for an explosion at a refinery in Washington state that killed seven workers in 2010, saying in a draft report released on Thursday that the company had failed to identify the damage hydrogen was causing to steel components.The seven workers were engulfed by a fireball of hydrogen and naphtha at Tesoro's Anacortes refinery in 2010 when they were checking for leaks and helping with the start-up of another, nearby heat exchanger when piping on a heat exchanger in operation suddenly failed.Five of the workers died on the day of the explosion. Two others died within the following month.The U.S. Chemical Safety Board (CSB) also faulted industry practices recommended by the American Petroleum Institute, saying that they do not require refiners to take necessary steps to prevent high-temperature hydrogen attack that allows minute cracks to form in carbon steel like that on the heat exchanger which ruptured at the Anacortes refinery on April 2, 2010.The head of the agency's western regional office said the accident was preventable.""If Tesoro had used the materials to construct the heat exchanger that they used to repair the unit after the accident, then the accident wouldn't have happened,"" regional head Don Holmstrom said. He said that use of inherently safer technology was the surest way to prevent accidents like the rupture of piping on a naphtha hydrotreater heat exchanger at the Anacortes refinery.The CSB, a five-member board appointed by the president that investigates chemical fires, said in a statement that the investigation ""cited deficiencies in the company's safety culture that led to a 'complacent' attitude toward flammable leaks and occasional fires.""The agency said investigators also found that ""during the unit startup, Tesoro did not correct the history of hazardous conditions or limit the number of people involved in the hazardous non-routine startup of the heat exchangers.""In a statement, Tesoro criticized the draft report and said the board's investigation teams had suffered heavy turnover. ""We respectfully disagree with several findings in the draft report and, most importantly, take exception to CSB's inaccurate depiction of our process safety culture,"" Tesoro said.The company said it would discuss disagreements with the board over the probe's findings once the report is approved by the CSB.The CSB has no regulatory or law enforcement power, but recommends policies and standards to industry and government. It plans to vote on a final version of the report this year.EYES STATE STANDARDS  The CSB also said the Washington State Department of Labor & Industries, which regulates workplace safety, needed tougher standards and should perform a safety audit of the state's five refineries.A spokeswoman for Labor & Industries said the agency had no immediate comment on the CSB report on Thursday.The report suggests Washington state switch its regulatory system to one like that in the UK that requires use of the safest possible technology.A similar recommendation for California by the board staff led to sharp disagreements among the board's three members at a public meeting in Richmond, California, on Jan. 15. Two board members said such a radical overhaul would not ensure safer refineries and chemical plants.The California proposals were made after an Aug. 6, 2012, fire at Chevron Corp's Richmond refinery sent 15,000 San Francisco Bay-area residents to areas hospitals with complaints of respiratory problems.In its report about Tesoro's Anacortes blast, the CSB also said the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency does not enforce the use of inherently safer technology, but could do so under its current powers.The Anacortes explosion was the deadliest at a U.S. refinery since the 2005 explosion at a Texas City, Texas, refinery then owned by BP Plc., which killed 15 workers and injured another 180.In a separate investigation completed six months after the blast, the Washington Department of Labor & Industries found the explosion was preventable, but came about because Tesoro did not stick to its own guidelines for maintaining equipment.

2,"  * Entire fleet to have newest safety designs by mid-2014* Railport project on target for late 2014, early 2015By Kristen HaysHOUSTON, Feb 6 Independent refiner Tesoro Corp  is replacing older railcars in its crude-by-rail fleet with ones that have the latest safety designs, Chief Executive Officer Greg Goff told analysts on Thursday.He said 90 percent of Tesoro's fleet consists of railcars that meet the latest design standards embraced by the rail industry for all tank cars manufactured after October 2011. U.S. regulators have yet to impose such standards.By mid-2014, Tesoro will have replaced the remaining 10 percent of its fleet, currently comprising older cars, with ones that meet the industry's newer design standards, Goff said during the company's quarterly earnings call.Keith Casey, senior vice president of strategy and business development, told Reuters that as regulators consider imposing more stringent railcar standards, Tesoro decided to replace its remaining older cars ""proactively, in advance of the regulations.""Refiners, railcar makers and railroads are in talks with regulators on stronger standards in the aftermath of several fiery crashes as oil-by-train transport has surged in tandem with the U.S. crude production boom.It was the latest effort by a refiner to reassure the public about tank car safety following the crashes that sharply hiked scrutiny of moving oil by train.Last week Joe Gorder, chief operating officer for Valero Energy Corp, the largest U.S. refiner, told analysts that all 5,320 railcars the company has on order meet the newer standards. He said Valero could use the incoming newer cars to move crude and use the 6,000 cars it currently leases to move other materials, such as asphalt and ethanol, he said.PBF Energy Chairman Tom O'Malley said last year that the refiner expects to use all newer company-owned crude railcars by the end of 2014 as its rail capacity expands, and all of Phillips 66's crude cars meet the latest standard.Casey said Tesoro's replacement cars will be ""jacketed,"" or have a more puncture-resistant shell, as well as heating coils capable of moving undiluted heavy Canadian crude.While the change gives Tesoro the flexibility to start moving Canadian crude to its refineries, Casey said the company will initially stick to lighter inland U.S. crudes in cars with the additional protection against punctures or leaks.New regulations under consideration by the U.S. Department of Transportation's Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration could make all refiners, logistics companies and shippers that move oil by train replace or retrofit crude railcars made before October 2011. The railcar industry estimates that some 80,000 tank cars that haul flammable liquids, including crude, don't meet the post-October 2011 standards.Railcars involved in a runaway crude train that exploded and killed 47 people in Quebec last July were of the older design, as were cars that crashed into a derailed grain car in North Dakota in December, according to investigators.Crude movements rose 71 percent in 2013 compared with 2012,more than 10 percent of average U.S. output of 7.5 million barrels per day last year, according to the Association of American Railroads, the rail industry's trade group. MORE SHIPMENTS Tesoro began shipping Bakken crude via rail to its 120,000 bpd refinery in Anacortes, Washington, in September 2012, and has since begun shipping up to 12,000 bpd to its 166,000 bpd Golden Eagle refinery in Martinez, California.In addition, Casey said other potential sources for rail shipments include the Niobrara shale play in Wyoming and Colorado and the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico.The company also is seeking permits to build a $100 million joint-venture railport with Savage Services at the Port of Vancouver in Washington.The project, which remains on target to start up in late 2014 or early next year, would receive railed crude and then load it on barges or tankers to go to West Coast refineries run by Tesoro and other companies.Other refiners also receive crude via rail - particularly on the West and East coasts - to tap crudes that are cheaper than imports despite lacking pipeline infrastructure.Goff told analysts that the recent crude train crashes have prompted more ""public interaction"" with proposed rail project permitting.""We feel good about working through that,"" he said.He also said Tesoro implemented emergency procedures more than a year ago to respond to a crude train incident within two hours anywhere on the route from North Dakota to Washington state.",2014-02-06,TSO,"Thu Feb 6, 2014 | 5:55pm EST",UPDATE 2-Tesoro replacing older crude railcars in its fleet -CEO,http://www.reuters.com//article/tesoro-crude-rail-idUSL2N0LB0VK20140206?type=companyNews

8,"  * Construction now slated for late 2014-early 2015* Delay due to state-required environmental impact study* Project cost up to $150 mln-$190 mln, previously $100 mln   (Recasts with length of delay, adds detail about project and oil by rail on U.S. West Coast)By Kristen HaysHOUSTON, May 1 The start-up of a major Pacific Northwest rail-to-barge terminal that could bring hundreds of thousands of barrels per day of cheap North American crude to the U.S. West Coast will be delayed by at least a few months due to environmental requirements, the top executive at Tesoro Corp  said on Thursday.In addition, the cost for Tesoro's joint-venture project at the Port of Vancouver in Washington could be as much as 90 percent more than originally planned, Chief Executive Greg Goff said during the company's quarterly earnings call.The project is seeking permits to handle up to 380,000 barrels per day.The delay comes as opposition to the crude-by-rail movement, which is booming in tandem with the U.S. shale oil revolution, is gaining steam in the aftermath of several fiery crude train crashes and derailments since last summer. On Wednesday 15 railcars on a CSX Corp crude train derailed in Lynchburg, Virginia, catching fire and spilling about 831 barrels of oil into the James River.Tesoro and its partner, Savage Services, submitted environmental permit requests for the railport in August, and had expected the railport to start up in late 2014 or early 2015.On Thursday, Goff said construction is now expected to begin in that timeframe. The railport will be able to begin running before the entire project is completed, with initial volumes arriving in mid-2015. The entire project will be completed a year after construction starts, he said.The estimated cost of the railport also has risen, to a range of $150 million to $190 million, from about $100 million, Goff said. The cost will be split 50-50 between Tesoro and Savage. Goff said the project delay is because the company is waiting for the state to provide it with requirements for an environmental impact study.""We are in the window when the state will come out with their requirements for the EIS, and then we will comply with that,"" Goff said. ""That has put us somewhere between six to eight weeks behind schedule.""He said the company can respond quickly when the state provides those requirements, and ""it's the only delay that we've experienced so far."" MORE ACCESS Tesoro led the charge on the West Coast when it came to tapping cheaper inland U.S. and Canadian crudes. The company in September 2012 started up an offloading facility at its 120,000 barrel-per-day refinery in Anacortes, Washington, which receives up to 50,000 bpd of North Dakota Bakken crude.Other refiners have done the same or are trying, as no major pipelines move crude to the West Coast and rail has been the region's only way to substitute cheaper North American crude for more expensive imports.The railport project would serve the entire West Coast, not just Tesoro plants, and be the largest crude-by-rail operation in the region by far.While permits are seeking capacity up to 380,000 bpd, Goff has said actual volumes will hover around 300,000 bpd.(Reporting by Kristen Hays; Editing by Nick Zieminski and Leslie Adler)",2014-05-01,TSO,"Thu May 1, 2014 | 6:30pm EDT",UPDATE 2-Tesoro says plan for Washington state crude railport delayed,http://www.reuters.com//article/tesoro-crude-railway-idUSL2N0NN0PS20140501?type=companyNews
9,"   By Kristen Hays | ANACORTES, Washington  ANACORTES, Washington May 30 When Tesoro Corp  pioneered moving crude by rail to its Washington state refinery in 2012, it encountered little community opposition. The same goes for early adopters BP Plc and Phillips 66 .But Royal Dutch Shell may have a tougher go at it. Shell is seeking permits, from the same regional air quality control agency that approved the others, to transport by rail up to 70,000 bpd of Bakken crude to its 145,000 bpd Puget Sound refinery, at a time when a spate of fiery crude train crashes nationwide have stoked opposition to crude-by-rail.Indeed, there wasn't a community push back in 2012 when Tesoro began receiving up to six BNSF Railway Co mile-long crude trains a week - until another railroad's runaway crude train crashed into a Quebec town in July 2013, killing 47 people.BP and Phillips 66 also won approval for offloading projects at their Washington refineries in 2013, ahead of even more fiery, if not deadly, derailments.As officials review Shell's proposal, those who oppose the transporting of volatile oil from North Dakota by rail now say they want a comprehensive environmental review by the state.""There was no opposition to the other three proposals only because we weren't aware they were in formal permitting,"" said Terry Wechsler, an environmental attorney in northwest Washington who seeks more scrutiny. Shell declined to comment.LIFELINE  Those already operating say transporting oil by rail is a lifeline to cheaper crudes as no oil pipelines cross the Cascade Range. Without rail, Washington refineries are stuck with more expensive imports and declining Alaskan North Slope oil.""It was really starting to hurt our business out here,"" Bill Kidd, senior director of government affairs for BP Plc's  U.S. arm, said at the rail offloading operation next to the company's 225,000 bpd Cherry Point refinery near Blaine, Washington.BP started taking 70,000 bpd of Bakken in December, while  Tesoro began receiving 50,000 bpd at its 120,000 bpd Anacortes refinery in September 2012. Tesoro says incoming crude via rail reduced by a third what used to be nearly 450 ships that once delivered crude to its docks annually.Phillips 66 is building infrastructure to take 30,000 bpd at its 101,000 bpd Ferndale refinery by year-end.Tesoro and BP say they took extra steps for safety with closed systems. Thick hoses hook to the bottom of rail cars to drain crude into a pipeline that pumps it to storage tanks. While unloading, a smaller hose hooks into a vapor recovery system at the top, ensuring no gases escape.Savage Companies handles unloading for both once BNSF trains arrive.BP and Tesoro also removed tons of dirt from hillsides to ensure trains sit on flat surfaces.""We wanted to make sure it was flat enough so the rail cars can't move on their own,"" said Jason James, operations superintendent at Cherry Point.

""In the short term, the strikes are definitely driving prices up,"" said Phil Flynn of Price Futures Group in Chicago.U.S. gasoline and diesel fuel prices rose on Monday on concerns over supply, as well as a bounce in U.S. benchmark crude to about $50 a barrel.Gasoline futures traded in New York rose more than $0.05 to $1.53 a gallon, though retail gasoline prices are still at their cheapest in years after having fallen about 40 percent since the middle of 2014.The United Steelworkers union (USW) said Royal Dutch Shell Plc , the lead industry negotiator, halted negotiations early Sunday after the union rejected a fifth proposal from the company.

18,"   By Jarrett Renshaw | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Tesoro Corp (TSO.N) and Marathon Petroleum Corp's (MPC.N) contingency plans to employ replacement workers at two of their refineries after union employees hit the picket lines are under scrutiny by inspectors in both Kentucky and California, officials of the two states said Wednesday.Kentucky's Labor Department opened an investigation into Marathon’s Catlettsburg refinery after it received a compliance complaint on Monday, a day after union workers walked out, agency spokesman Daniel Lowry said.Lowry said the investigation involves health and safety issues.Marathon spokesman Brandon Daniels said the company is cooperating with the investigation, but said he had no further information. In California the state's Department of Industrial Relations had planned inspections at Tesoro's Carson refinery before the strike, once it was clear that the company and the local chapter of the United Steelworkers were not going to agree on a new contract, agency spokeswoman Julia Bernstein said Wednesday. The state has not sent inspectors to Tesoro's other refinery, in Martinez, which was shut due to the strike, she said.  Tesoro did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The California refineries are among nine facilities represented by the USW where workers have hit the picket lines. Eight of the plants have remained operational with replacement workers.The U.S. Department of Labor has an open investigation that dates back into Marathon's Galveston Bay facility, which is among the refineries where strikes have occurred, a department spokesman said. The investigation started on Dec 10, before the strikes and stems from a complaint regarding the recording of workplace injuries, the spokesman said.  Galveston Bay is the only Texas facility with an open investigation. Officials in Washington, where workers have walked out at Tesoro's Anacortes refinery, did not respond to questions about whether the facility was visited by inspectors. Often, a complaint or an incident gets the attention of state and federal inspectors. Since the walkout on Sunday, Tesoro's Carson refinery has reported two unexpected unit upsets to state regulators.     Further walkouts may be ordered at some of the other 63 refineries and chemical plants if advances are not made, the union has said. The walkouts are in support of a nationwide pact that would cover 30,000 workers and mark the industry's first big strike since 1980.Lynne Hancock, spokeswoman for the USW, said the replacement workers lack the rigorous training that USW workers receive.""They know the ins and outs of these facilities, and have years of training,” she said.

22,"   By Kristen Hays | HOUSTON  HOUSTON Tesoro Corp's proposed U.S. crude-to-barge port in Vancouver, Washington, may not be built until next year based on a possible timetable for Gov. Jay Inslee's approval, according to documents filed with a state council reviewing the project.Tesoro and its partner, Savage Services, had hoped by late this year to start loading railed-in crude onto vessels for delivery to U.S. West Coast refineries, mainly in California.Tesoro originally slated the to start up in late 2014, but pushed it to mid-2015 to accommodate lengthy reviews.However, a state council studying the $190 million, 360,000 barrels per day project may not send Inslee its recommendation of approval or rejection until early November. The governor then has two months to decide, which could be early 2016.The project requires an extensive review that includes an environmental impact study and a trial-like adjudication hearing where opponents and supporters can testify. Tesoro Chief Executive Officer Greg Goff told analysts on Thursday that a draft of the environmental impact study is slated to be released in May.The state's Energy Facility Site Evaluation Council (EFSEC) late last month ordered the adjudication process to start as well, setting deadlines for supporters and opponents to signal intent to participate. But EFSEC can take months to deliberate after the adjudication wraps up before sending Inslee its recommendation. EFSEC's current deadline to send that recommendation is March 2, ""and it is now apparent that date cannot be met,"" Tesoro and Savage told EFSEC earlier this month. The companies asked the council to consider moving that deadline to Nov. 1.State law requires EFSEC to send the governor its recommendation within a year of receiving a project permit application, but the council and the companies can agree to delays.Tesoro applied for the permit in August 2013. Last year the recommendation deadline was pushed to March 2015. Goff didn't mention those details on the quarterly analyst call. When pressed for a ""drop-dead"" date to get the council recommendation to the governor, Goff said it wasn't ""completely black and white"" on dates and deadlines, but the start of the adjudication process a positive sign.""All of the issues and everything that you deal with to get the permit seems to be progressing at a slower pace, but progressing well,"" Goff said.

The USW has said the company is also considering a counterproposal from the union.""We're going to talk about safe staffing one way or the other,"" Beevers said.

26,"  HOUSTON Feb 17 Tesoro Corp has approved two projects at its Washington state refinery to produce a petrochemical feedstock for export and cleaner gasoline, the company said on Tuesday.The company's $300 million mixed xylenes project, slated to start up in 2017, will gather reformate, a high-octane gasoline blending stock, from Tesoro's U.S. West Coast refineries at its 120,000 barrels per day refinery in Anacortes. There, a new unit will extract 15,000 bpd of xylene from the reformate primarily to export to Asian markets.Xylene is used primarily to make polyester fibers and films for clothing, food packaging and beverage containers, Tesoro said. C.J. Warner, Tesoro's executive vice president of strategy and business development, told analysts in December that gasoline supply on the West Coast was ample, while Asian demand for xylenes was growing. The company can extract xylene from reformate not needed for gasoline and export it at lower cost than U.S. Gulf Coast refineries because of the closer proximity to those markets, she said. The company also approved a $90 million naphtha isomerization project, slated to start up in 2018, that is intended to comply with reduced-sulfur gasoline regulations and cut gasoline production costs, Tesoro said. Naphtha is a building block for gasoline.

27,"   By Erwin Seba | HOUSTON  HOUSTON Negotiations will resume on Wednesday between Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSa.L) and union leaders as they haggle over a new wage contract for striking U.S. refinery workers, the company said.The two camps have been in a stalemate since the United Steelworkers union (USW) called walkouts early on Sunday at nine plants with about 10 percent of U.S. refining capacity, saying Shell, the lead negotiator for the oil companies, left the negotiating table when talks broke down.The talks have been tougher than in years past. A drop of more than 50 percent in oil prices since June has eroded profits of major oil companies, prompting executives to say they cannot afford to lift wages for workers.""Talks are scheduled for today,"" Shell spokesman Ray Fisher said.The union said in a text message that talks late on Tuesday made no progress and that they would resume on Wednesday. Shell called Tuesday's talks productive.Further walkouts may be ordered at some of the other 63 refineries and chemical plants it represents if advances are not made, the union has said.Neither side has said when on Wednesday they will meet. Shell has declined to detail the nature of the negotiations.Marathon Petroleum Corp (MPC.N) Chief Executive Gary Heminger, whose company owns two of the refineries with workers on strike, deferred to Shell as the lead negotiator regarding any comment, calling the talks a ""delicate situation.""    Since bargaining first started on Jan. 21, the union has rejected five offers from Shell. The union is seeking annual pay increases of 6 percent, double the size of those in the last agreement. It also wants work that has been given in the past to non-union contractors to start going to USW members, a tighter policy to prevent workplace fatigue and reductions in members' out-of-pocket payments for healthcare.While acknowledging that upstream businesses have been hurt, labor leaders say independent refiners and the refining units of integrated companies have been posting big profits thanks to cheap prices for U.S. crudes they turn into gasoline and diesel.The walkouts are in support of a nationwide pact that would cover 30,000 workers and mark the industry's first big strike since 1980.Most affected refineries are being run near normal by  trained managers, retirees and others from non-union plants brought in to replace workers.

28,"   By Jarrett Renshaw | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Tesoro Corp (TSO.N) and Marathon Petroleum Corp's (MPC.N) contingency plans to employ replacement workers at two of their refineries after union employees hit the picket lines are under scrutiny by inspectors in both Kentucky and California, officials of the two states said Wednesday.Kentucky's Labor Department opened an investigation into Marathon’s Catlettsburg refinery after it received a compliance complaint on Monday, a day after union workers walked out, agency spokesman Daniel Lowry said.Lowry said the investigation involves health and safety issues.Marathon spokesman Brandon Daniels said the company is cooperating with the investigation, but said he had no further information. In California, the state's Department of Industrial Relations had planned a routine inspection at Tesoro's Carson refinery before the strike, and decided to use the time to also check the qualifications of the replacement workers once the strike occurred, agency spokeswoman Julia Bernstein said Wednesday. The state has not sent inspectors to Tesoro's other refinery, in Martinez, which was shut due to the strike, she said.  Tesoro did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The California refineries are among nine facilities represented by the USW where workers have hit the picket lines. Eight of the plants have remained operational with replacement workers.The U.S. Department of Labor has an open investigation that dates back into Marathon's Galveston Bay facility, which is among the refineries where strikes have occurred, a department spokesman said. The investigation started on Dec 10, before the strikes and stems from a complaint regarding the recording of workplace injuries, the spokesman said.  Galveston Bay is the only Texas facility with an open investigation.Officials in Washington, where workers have walked out at Tesoro's Anacortes refinery, did not respond to questions about whether the facility was visited by inspectors. Often, a complaint or an incident gets the attention of state and federal inspectors. Since the walkout on Sunday, Tesoro's Carson refinery has reported two unexpected unit upsets to state regulators.     Further walkouts may be ordered at some of the other 63 refineries and chemical plants if advances are not made, the union has said. The walkouts are in support of a nationwide pact that would cover 30,000 workers and mark the industry's first big strike since 1980.Lynne Hancock, spokeswoman for the USW, said the replacement workers lack the rigorous training that USW workers receive.""They know the ins and outs of these facilities, and have years of training,” she said.

Not all refineries have adopted the policy.

33,"   By Erwin Seba | HOUSTON  HOUSTON The U.S. refinery strike widened on its 20th day, with workers at the nation's largest refinery walking off jobs and joining picket lines on Saturday as the United Steelworkers union (USW) pushes for a new contract that improves wages and safety.Strikes are underway or have been called at 15 plants, including 12 refineries with a fifth of U.S. crude processing capacity. The stoppages, which have forced companies to rely on trained temporary workers to keep plants running close to normal, are the largest in the refining sector since 1980.Shortly after talks between union and oil company representatives ended on Friday night, the union notified Motiva Enterprises [MOTIV.UL] of a strike by its members at the company's 600,250 barrel per day (bpd) refinery in Port Arthur, Texas.The USW also gave notices on Friday of strikes to begin in 24 hours at Motiva's 235,000 bpd Convent, Louisiana and 238,000 bpd Norco, Louisiana refineries and the Shell Oil Co chemical plant in Norco, the union said.""The industry’s refusal to meaningfully address safety issues through good faith bargaining gave us no other option but to expand our work stoppage,"" USW International President Leo Gerard said in a statement.Both sides indicated further negotiations this weekend had not been scheduled.Motiva is a 50-50 joint venture of Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Saudi Aramco [SDABO.UL]. Shell's U.S. arm Shell Oil Co is the lead oil company negotiator in talks with the USW for a national agreement on safety, pay and benefits.A Shell spokesman said the company was disappointed by the Port Arthur walkout and strike notices to the Louisiana plants. ""We believe this move sets the wrong tone for both parties to move forward and reach an agreement,"" said Shell spokesman Ray Fisher. ""We remain committed to continued safe operations and productive negotiations.""The strike that began Feb. 1 was last expanded Feb. 6, when workers at BP Plc-operated refineries in Indiana and Ohio were told to begin a work stoppage the following day.Workers were already on strike at Shell's 327,000 bpd joint-venture refinery in Deer Park, Texas, and an adjoining chemical plant. The Deer Park workforce walked out when the strike began on Feb. 1.The strike may complicate operations at the Port Arthur refinery, which failed to restore its second largest crude distillation unit (CDU) to full production after restarting on Friday following a three-day shutdown to fix leaking piping, sources told Reuters.The 195,000 bpd CDU is one of three at the refinery that do the initial refining of crude oil coming into the plant and provide feedstock for all other production units. The refinery's largest CDU, which has a rated capacity of 325,000, bpd is running at about 200,000 bpd, the sources said, because a 60,000 bpd hydrocracking unit is shut due to a malfunction. The hydrocracker produces motor fuel, primarily diesel, which has become a lucrative export for U.S. refiners.Motiva also shut a 92,000 bpd gasoline-producing fluidic catalytic cracking unit at the refinery in early January for an overhaul. It is scheduled to restart in the first half of March. Shell and the union had been meeting continuously since talks resumed on Wednesday following a week-long break for the company to reply to an information request and a counterproposal from the USW.Union negotiators rejected the seventh contract offer from Shell on Thursday night.  Earlier this week, the USW's lead negotiator, International Vice President Gary Beevers, told Reuters that safe staffing levels at refineries and chemical plants were a sticking point in the talks.Another point of contention is the absence of ""no retrogression"" language, which preserves agreements from previous contracts not addressed in negotiations this year.In addition to the two BP-operated plants, workers are striking at refineries and plants owned by Lyondell Basell, Marathon Petroleum Corp, and Tesoro Corp in California, Kentucky, Texas and Washington state. Only one refinery has shut down due to the strike.Tesoro's 166,000-bpd plant in Martinez, California, was scheduled prior to the strike for a partial shutdown to perform a planned multi-unit overhaul. Company officials decided to idle the entire plant after the walkout began and said production would not resume during the work stoppage.The USW is seeking a three-year, industrywide pact that would cover 30,000 workers at 63 U.S. refineries that together account for two-thirds of domestic capacity.

34,"   By Erwin Seba | HOUSTON  HOUSTON The largest U.S. refinery strike in 35 years entered its fourth week as workers at 12 refineries accounting for one-fifth of national production capacity were walking picket lines as of 12 a.m. CST (0600 GMT) on Sunday, according to union officials.A total of 6,550 members of the United Steelworkers union (USW) at 15 plants, including the 12 refineries, are involved in the work stoppage that began on Feb. 1 when talks for a new three-year contract between the USW and lead oil company negotiator Shell Oil Co stopped.Talks were resumed but have halted again after nearly reaching an agreement on Friday, said sources familiar with the negotiations.After the latest breakdown between the two sides, Steelworkers leaders targeted Shell, which is the U.S. arm of Royal Dutch Shell Plc, calling workers out at a chemical plant and three refineries in the company's Motiva Enterprises [MOTIV.UL] joint-venture with Saudi Aramco [SDABO.UL].The first work stoppage of the three refineries was at the nation's largest, the 600,250 barrel per day Port Arthur, Texas, refinery, where workers walked out at 12 a.m. on Saturday.Twenty-four hours later, USW members were also picketing at Motiva's 235,000 bpd Convent, Louisiana, and 238,000 bpd Norco, Louisiana, refineries and the Shell chemical plant in Norco.In announcing the strikes, USW International union President Leo Gerard said they were the result of the industry's bargaining tactics.""The industry’s refusal to meaningfully address safety issues through good faith bargaining gave us no other option but to expand our work stoppage,"" Gerard said in a statement.No new talks had been scheduled between the two sides.Shell and the USW were near an agreement for a new contract on Friday night, but other oil companies were unwilling to accept the bargain, said sources familiar with the talks.  ""As the lead company, Shell has the role to get the oil companies to come along,"" said one of the sources. ""The (union) leadership group decided Shell needed to be put on the list of targeted companies.""Shell spokesman said it was disappointed by the new strikes.In a letter Shell has sent to striking employees at its Deer Park, Texas, refinery and chemical plant, a copy of which was seen by Reuters, the company said the key sticking point was non-union contractors who perform daily maintenance, which the USW would like to see replaced with union workers.The company said it needed flexibility.""Hiring flexibility is a proven way to protect our core Shell workforce and the long-term economic viability of our workforce,"" the letter said. ""This strategy has served us all well, as we have not had to conduct any layoffs in decades."" The strike that began Feb. 1 was last expanded Feb. 6, when workers at BP Plc-operated refineries in Indiana and Ohio were told to begin a work stoppage the following day.Workers were already on strike at Shell's 327,000 bpd joint-venture refinery in Deer Park since the strike began on Feb. 1.The strike may complicate operations at the Port Arthur refinery, where two of three crude distillation units, the workhores of the refinery, are running below capacity and fuel-making units are shut for repairs or refurbishment.Shell and the union met continuously from Wednesday through Friday following a week-long break for the company to reply to an information request and a counterproposal from the USW.Union negotiators have rejected seven contract offers from Shell.  The USW's lead negotiator, International Vice President Gary Beevers, has told Reuters that safe staffing levels were a point of contention in the talks.The union also wants ""no retrogression"" language, which preserves agreements from previous contracts.In addition to the BP, Motiva and Shell plants, workers are striking at ones owned by Lyondell Basell, Marathon Petroleum, and Tesoro in California, Kentucky, Texas and Washington.

35,"   By Erwin Seba | HOUSTON  HOUSTON The largest U.S. refinery strike in 35 years entered its fourth week on Sunday as workers at 12 refineries accounting for one-fifth of national production capacity were walking picket lines.Sources familiar with the negotiations said talks may resume by mid-week to end the walkout by 6,550 members of the United Steelworkers union (USW) at 15 plants, including the 12 refineries.Representatives of both sides said no date has been set to restart negotiations, however.The strike comes as U.S. workers seek more pay in a strengthening economy. Wal-Mart Stores Inc has said its U.S. workers will get a raise to at least $9 an hour, while West Coast port workers have reached a tentative deal for a new contract after a months-long dispute.The refinery work stoppage began on Feb. 1 when talks for a new three-year contract between the USW and lead oil company negotiator Shell Oil Co broke down.Talks were resumed but halted again after nearly reaching an agreement on Friday, said sources familiar with the negotiations.After the latest breakdown between the two sides, Steelworkers leaders targeted Shell, which is the U.S. arm of Royal Dutch Shell Plc, calling workers out at a chemical plant and three refineries in the company's Motiva Enterprises [MOTIV.UL] joint-venture with Saudi Aramco [SDABO.UL].The work stoppage now includes the nation's largest refinery, Motiva's 600,250 barrel per day (bpd) Port Arthur, Texas, refinery. USW members are also picketing at Motiva's 235,000 bpd Convent, Louisiana, and 238,000 bpd Norco, Louisiana, refineries and the Shell chemical plant in Norco.In a letter to striking employees at the Shell and Motiva plants, company officials said Shell has offered annual pay raises of 2 percent in each of the first two years of a proposed three-year pact and a 2.5-percent increase in the third year.The company has also offered to study issues of worker fatigue, which has been cited as a factor in at least one fatal accident in the past 10 years.Shell also told striking employees the key sticking point was non-union contractors who perform daily maintenance. The USW would like to see them replaced with union workers.""Hiring flexibility is a proven way to protect our core Shell workforce and the long-term economic viability of our workforce,"" the letter said. ""This strategy has served us all well, as we have not had to conduct any layoffs in decades."" A union spokeswoman declined comment on Sunday about the letter.The Shell letter did not address the absence of ""no-retrogression"" language, which keeps agreements from previous contracts, including several on safety, in place. The lack of a no-retrogression clause has become a sticking point in talks, union leaders have said.Shell spokesman Ray Fisher said no-retrogression language has not been a focus of the talks so far. ""The four key areas of focus in the negotiations are wages, healthcare, use of contractors and fatigue,"" Fisher said. ""The union's 'no retrogression' proposal has not yet been a focus area of our negotiations.""

About 6,550 workers are walking picket lines at 15 plants, including 12 refineries that account for one-fifth of U.S. refining capacity. Refiners are using trained replacement workers, primarily managers and engineers, to keep plants running close to normal.In a text message on Monday night sent to union members and the news media, the USW called on Shell to return to the negotiating table.A spokesman said Shell looks forward to resuming negotiations. More information might come from a news conference USW International President Leo Gerard has scheduled for Tuesday morning in Atlanta.In a letter to employees, Shell said the major sticking point in the talks was the USW's push to shift daily maintenance work from non-union contractors to union members. The company said it offered a 6.5 percent increase in pay to the USW over the three years of the agreement.In a letter on Monday night, Tesoro Corp Executive Vice President Keith Casey urged striking workers to return to work at company refineries on the West Coast.""I can confirm we have had folks make this decision and rejoin us at all of our refineries,"" Casey said. ""The same is occurring across the industry.""Casey also said Tesoro is preparing to restart its 166,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) refinery in Martinez, California, which has been shut since Feb. 6 for a planned multi-unit overhaul.Workers are also striking at the Shell refinery and chemical plant in Deer Park, Texas, and at plants in California, Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio, Texas and Washington owned by BP Plc, Lyondell Basell NV, Marathon Petroleum Corp and Tesoro.

38,"   By Lawrence Hurley | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTONThe U.S. Supreme Court on Monday ducked a major ruling on whether Amtrak, the government-owned passenger rail company, wields too much clout in setting regulations that private freight carriers also must follow.The court, on a 9-0 vote, threw out a lower court ruling against the government by finding that Amtrak is a government entity, not a private company. But the court, in an opinion by Justice Anthony Kennedy, also said that further litigation is required to determine if there are constitutional problems with Amtrak's unique status within the regulatory framework.Among the potential questions raised by Kennedy is whether there are due process problems because a government-owned, nominally for-profit entity has regulatory authority over the industry in which it participates.Kennedy wrote that the ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit was based on the ""flawed premise"" that Amtrak was a private entity. The case was brought by the Association of American Railroads, which had challenged a federal law that gives Amtrak a key role in setting standards for railroads, including for on-time performance.Freight carriers own the tracks that Amtrak uses. They object to Amtrak's role because they can then be forced to pay damages if Amtrak trains fail to meet performance targets. Under the 1970 arrangement with private rail companies that led to Amtrak's creation, Amtrak trains get top priority on the tracks.  In return, private railroads no longer had to provide passenger service. The railroad law allows Amtrak and the U.S. Federal Railroad Administration to work jointly on the regulations.The railroad association challenged regulations finalized by the government in 2010 that freight carriers contend set unrealistic performance targets. Association members include BNSF Railway Company[BNISF.UL] and CSX Transportation Inc. The case is Department of Transportation v. Association of American Railroads, U.S. Supreme Court, No. 13-1080.  (Reporting by Lawrence Hurley; Editing by Will Dunham)",2015-03-09,TSO,"Mon Mar 9, 2015 | 12:27pm EDT",Supreme Court shunts Amtrak case down the line,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-usa-court-railway-idUSKBN0M51F620150309?type=companyNews
39,"  (Adds statement from Tesoro, details on wage hikes)By Erwin SebaHOUSTON, March 12 The United Steelworkers union and oil companies have reached a tentative deal to end the largest U.S. refinery strike in 35 years, the labor group and people familiar with the negotiations said on Thursday.The new agreement for about 30,000 workers would last four years, a year longer than previous agreements. The deal, which still needs to be ratified, may not end strikes right away at all refineries that have suffered walkouts as local union chapters could still need to work out pending issues.""We salute the solidarity exhibited by our membership,"" said USW International President Leo Gerard. ""There was no way we would have won vast improvements in safety and staffing without it."" Tesoro Corp told employees in a letter seen by Reuters it was ""supportive of the agreement"" and would try to quickly settle local issues ""to enable our employees return to work."" Lead industry negotiator Royal Dutch Shell Plc  did not comment.The tentative contract contains language that addresses worker fatigue, which is tied to accidents, and the use of contractors versus unionized labor. It also safeguards gains made in previous contracts, the union and sources said. They added that annual wage increases would be 2.5 percent the first year, 3 percent each in years two and three, and 3.5 percent in the fourth year.Twelve refineries with a fifth of U.S. refining capacity have been hit by strikes during the last 40 days. Companies have responded by calling in temporary workers after 6,550 people walked off the job. Only one plant, Tesoro's 166,000-barrel-per-day (bpd) refinery in Martinez, California, was shut by the strike as it was already undergoing maintenance when the walkout started. The company said it will reopen when the strike ends.The contract would cover refineries owned by Exxon Mobil Corp, BP Plc, Valero Energy Corp and Chevron Corp among others.On Wednesday, in a message to its members, the union said it was assembling its policy committee which represents the rank and file, to review proposals from industry during contract talks.That move was widely seen as a signal that the strike may be nearing an end as the union pushed for higher wages and what it called better safety practices in a new pact for about 60 plants.

45,"  (Updates with quotes, details on project and review process)By Kristen HaysHOUSTON May 8 Tesoro Corp's proposed railport project in Washington state will likely be pushed to next year as it undergoes a ""painfully slow"" government review process, the chief executive of the independent oil refiner told analysts on Friday.The $190 million, 360,000-barrels-per-day project would be the biggest in the United States, moving U.S. and Canadian oil via rail to the Port of Vancouver where it would be loaded onto vessels to supply West Coast refineries - mainly in California. Tesoro originally had hoped to begin operations in late 2014, and then pushed initial startup to mid-2015. Tesoro CEO Greg Goff said on Friday that ""something could happen in the first part of 2016.""""We're absolutely committed to the project. We believe it will be successful and we just have to keep focused,"" Goff said during a quarterly earnings call. No major crude pipelines move oil west across the Rocky Mountains, so West Coast refineries have limited access to North American crudes that are cheaper than imports.Some individual refineries receive crude via rail, but many such projects are stalled amid opposition in light of multiple fiery crude train crashes, the latest just two days ago in North Dakota. A Washington state council has begun a trial-like adjudication process as part of its review of the Tesoro project, and its environmental impact statement is slated to be released in mid-2015 - later than the May time frame Tesoro had previously expected.The council will then submit its recommendation to Washington Governor Jay Inslee, who has the final say on whether the railport will be built. He has two months from the date he receives the recommendation to decide.Goff said Tesoro and its partner, Savage Services, are doing ""everything possible to keep it moving forward, but at the end of the day we're somewhat at the mercy of how that council progresses.""

47,"   By Rory Carroll | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO A 52-day labor strike that led to a shutdown at Tesoro Corp's refinery in Martinez, California, helped boost the company’s bottom line last quarter, the company’s chief executive said on Friday, prompting cries that the state’s gasoline market needs to be reformed. “There’s no question that during the first quarter with what happened to Tesoro as a result of the disruption at the Martinez refinery because of the labor disruption and then with other operating and planned maintenance things across the whole system, it was very supportive to the margin environment there,” CEO Gregory Goff said during a call with investors. The 166,000 barrel-per-day Golden Eagle refinery, which is located in the San Francisco Bay Area, was undergoing maintenance when the United Steelworkers union called for a work stoppage at the plant as part of a national labor dispute that was resolved in March.  California wholesale gasoline prices rose at their quickest week-on-week rate ever in February when Exxon Mobil’s refinery in Torrance, California, was rocked by an explosion and fire, further constraining supply to the market. Jamie Court, president of Consumer Watchdog, said the comments show that the California market is not working for the average driver. He said Tesoro’s profit per barrel in the first quarter jumped by 20 cents, amounting to California profits of $119 million for Tesoro.  “California’s oil refiners are the only industry in America that make a fortune when their factories break down,” Court said. Tesoro spokeswoman Tina Barbee said the decision to stop production at Golden Eagle during the strike was a safety precaution since the refinery was undergoing maintenance when the strike was called. She said that there are many factors that impact margins on the West Coast.

48,"  (Corrects typo in ""they"" in second to last paraphraph)By Rory CarrollSAN FRANCISCO May 8 A 52-day labor strike that led to a shutdown at Tesoro Corp's refinery in Martinez, California, helped boost the company's bottom line last quarter, the company's chief executive said on Friday, prompting cries that the state's gasoline market needs to be reformed.""There's no question that during the first quarter with what happened to Tesoro as a result of the disruption at the Martinez refinery because of the labor disruption and then with other operating and planned maintenance things across the whole system, it was very supportive to the margin environment there,"" CEO Gregory Goff said during a call with investors.The 166,000 barrel-per-day Golden Eagle refinery, which is located in the San Francisco Bay Area, was undergoing maintenance when the United Steelworkers union called for a work stoppage at the plant as part of a national labor dispute that was resolved in March. California wholesale gasoline prices rose at their quickest week-on-week rate ever in February when Exxon Mobil's  refinery in Torrance, California, was rocked by an explosion and fire, further constraining supply to the market.Jamie Court, president of Consumer Watchdog, said the comments show that the California market is not working for the average driver. He said Tesoro's profit per barrel in the first quarter jumped by 20 cents, amounting to California profits of $119 million for Tesoro. ""California's oil refiners are the only industry in America that make a fortune when their factories break down,"" Court said.Tesoro spokeswoman Tina Barbee said the decision to stop production at Golden Eagle during the strike was a safety precaution since the refinery was undergoing maintenance when the strike was called. She said that there are many factors that impact margins on the West Coast.Also on Friday, California state Senator Ben Hueso, chair of the energy committee, and Senator Jim Beall, chair of the transportation committee, sent a letter to seven oil company CEOs, including Goff, asking questions about the state's gasoline market.They asked for the amount of gasoline and diesel kept in reserve at each refinery, how it is decided when to schedule refinery maintenance, and why retail gasoline prices increase when their competitors experience a refinery outage.In addition to Tesoro, the letter was sent to the CEOs of  Shell, Alon, Phillips 66, Valero, Exxon Mobil and Chevron.

51,"   By Kristen Hays | HOUSTON  HOUSTON U.S. refiner Tesoro Corp has ordered new crude oil railcars with features that surpass safety standards that federal regulators set this month, executives told Reuters.The 210 tank cars being built in northern Louisiana are so-called pressure cars, with the same design as those that carry liquid petroleum gases such as propane and butane, gas cargoes that are more flammable than crude oil.They will be delivered in the coming months after being ordered in early 2014.The new federal rules for all crude and ethanol railcars built after Oct. 1 of this year do not require strength to the level of a pressure car but are stronger than the standards adopted by the industry in 2011.Tesoro, like other oil-by-rail players, knew the federal standards were coming and the basics of what they would likely be. But the company went further with a stronger car, ""which is the primary thing we control,"" C.J. Warner, Tesoro's head of strategy and business development, told Reuters.The order was a sign the refiner wanted to get ahead of the coming regulations and avoid potential capacity bottlenecks at companies that build tank cars as shippers must now renovate their fleets.Booming North American onshore production spurred sharp growth in moving oil by rail, particularly for U.S. West and East coast refiners which otherwise must depend on more costly imports. No major crude pipelines move oil from the Midcontinent west across the Rocky Mountains or east through the Appalachians and densely populated northeastern states.Fiery derailments, caused in some cases by track failures, have become more frequent as oil-by-rail and crude-only trains carrying 100 cars or more went from nearly nothing five years ago to more than 1 million barrels per day late last year.Opposition to moving oil by rail spiked on safety concerns, prompting the U.S. Department of Transportation and Canada to impose new railcar safety standards.Tesoro isn't the only refiner that didn't wait for word from the U.S. DOT to order stronger cars. Phillips 66 confirmed to Reuters that it also last year ordered 350 non-pressurized new cars that mostly match the new DOT standard. Those cars will be delivered by year-end, the company said.THICKER HULLS Both sets of new cars have 9/16-inch-thick hulls, steel shields on the front and back and protections for valves and fittings where crude goes in on top and drains out the bottom, as the new rules require, company executives said. Tesoro's design modifies those fittings to handle crude rather than just LPGs.Tesoro's cars also have test pressure specifications of 200 pounds per square inch of internal pressure, twice that for non-pressurized cars. A test pressure is typically 20 to 40 percent of how much pressure it would take for the railcar to burst. That level of test pressure is standard for cars that transport LPGs or highly poisonous substances such as hydrogen cyanide, according to the Association of American Railroads.""When we saw the design, we were very comfortable that it would meet the new standards that we anticipated,"" John Hack, Tesoro's head of rail operations, told Reuters.For Tesoro, which hopes to build the largest oil-by-rail facility in the United States in Washington state, it's an investment in safety and continued access to cheaper North American crudes.""It's very important to us to continue to transport North American crude and get it from the Midcontinent out to the West Coast where it competes very nicely with the foreign crudes,"" Warner said. RETROFITS? By last year most refiners, including Tesoro and Phillips 66, no longer accepted shipments in older, weaker railcars such as those used on a runaway crude train that careened into the small Quebec town of Lac Megantic in mid-2013, killing 47 people.Early last year Tesoro needed to replace the last of its older cars and worked with its builder, Berkshire Hathaway Inc's Union Tank Car, to develop the new design, Warner said.Tesoro and Phillips 66 aim to use their newest cars in crude trains before deciding whether to order more. Both companies' fleets meet the 2011 industry standard for cars with 7/16-inch-thick hulls and reinforced valves.Those 7/16-inch cars don't have to be thrown out, but to move in crude-only trains, they will need added protections, including 'jackets', or an extra layer of steel around the tank, according to the DOT rules.Neither Tesoro's nor Phillips 66's new cars are equipped with specialized brakes that the DOT said crude-only trains must have starting in 2021 or be held to 30 miles per hour. An oil industry trade group is challenging that provision in court.Hack said Tesoro is talking with Union Tank Car on possibly outfitting crude railcars to add enhanced brakes before the 2021 deadline.""We have some time to make that decision,"" he said.

55,"   By Jessica Resnick-Ault and Mike Stone  Tesoro Corp (TSO.N) held talks to buy smaller rival oil refiner HollyFrontier Corp (HFC.N) earlier this year in a bid to join the top echelons of the competitive U.S. refining industry, according to people familiar with the matter.Both companies were in discussions in the first quarter of 2015, but the negotiations were scuttled after HollyFrontier's board of directors balked at Tesoro's terms, including the proposed price, the sources said this week.  The sources did not disclose Tesoro's offer price for HollyFrontier, which has a market capitalization of around $9 billion. Tesoro is still interested in a deal and the talks may be rekindled, the people said.The sources asked not to be identified because the negotiations were confidential. San Antonio-based Tesoro said it constantly reviews its portfolio to ensure it has the right asset mix to deliver shareholder value and growth, and declined to comment on speculation. Dallas-based HollyFrontier did not immediately comment.A combined company would be the fourth-largest independent U.S. refiner, with a network of oil processing plants stretching across the Midwest and West Coast, from Oklahoma to California and Alaska.HollyFrontier's shares rallied over 7 percent on the news and were on track for their biggest one-day gain in 3-1/2 years.HollyFrontier shares were last up 3.5 percent at $47.68 after rising as high as $49.54. Tesoro shares fell 2.7 percent at $95.21.    EXPANDING FOOTPRINT  If successful, buying HollyFrontier would end a four-year effort by Tesoro Chief Executive Officer Gregory Goff to expand the company's footprint eastward. He has also approached privately held refiner Sinclair, one source said.HollyFrontier would offer Tesoro access to the lucrative Rocky Mountain region, where refiners close to domestic crude production have seen margins rise as they have access to crude that can be difficult to transport to traditional refining centers on the Gulf Coast.Goff has already grown Tesoro from a sleepy West Coast-focused refiner into a prominent independent refiner with plants in North Dakota, California, Washington, Alaska, and Utah. He also jettisoned an underperforming Hawaii plant, spun off Tesoro's pipeline and logistics assets into a $4.2 billion master-limited partnership (TLLP.N), and formed a joint-venture rail yard in Vancouver to bring North American crude to make its refineries more competitive.Since the talks with HollyFrontier ended, Tesoro has had a cash windfall as its California-based refineries benefited from elevated gasoline prices due to outages at its competitors, which may help it lift its offer. Tesoro plans to release second-quarter earnings on Aug. 6, and Holly on Aug. 5.     Valued at $8.95 billion, HollyFrontier has refineries in Oklahoma, Kansas, Utah, New Mexico, and Wyoming, giving it access to the storage hub at Cushing, Oklahoma, and the Southwest, where the markets are closely related to the West Coast that Tesoro already serves.While the companies generally operate in adjacent territory, they do each operate plants in Salt Lake City. The companies might be forced to divest one of their two plants there as part of a transaction, one of the people said. FLURRY OF DEALMAKING While much smaller than Shell's $70 billion takeover of BG, set for completion in early 2016, the deal would be the first major tie-up between two independent refiners since the $7 billion merger of Holly Corp and Frontier Oil Corp in 2011. Recently, integrated companies like Marathon Oil Corp and ConocoPhillips have spun off refining to favor exploration and production.  It could touch off a flurry of dealmaking in the United States. Last week, Reuters reported that French oil major Total S.A. wants to sell a 50 percent stake in its sole U.S. refinery. The deal would also illustrate how refining has remained a bright spot during the year-long crude oil price rout that has battered shale and offshore producers, service providers and traders.Unlike the 2008 price crash, when refiners got pinched by low gasoline demand, drivers have been taking to the road in record numbers to take advantage of lower prices, bolstering the companies that turn cheap crude into valuable products like gasoline and diesel.Refiners have also benefited from a decades-old ban on U.S. crude exports, which prohibits the export of oil, but allows refiners to export diesel, gasoline and other fuels. As the U.S. shale boom has pumped a level of crude not seen since the 1970s, refiners have churned out record volumes of products for export.(Corrects 10th paragraph to remove reference to adding plants) (Reporting by Jessica Resnick-Ault and Mike Stone in New York; Editing by Meredith Mazzilli and Jeffrey Benkoe)",2015-07-30,TSO,"Thu Jul 30, 2015 | 1:58pm EDT",Exclusive: Tesoro held unsuccessful talks to buy HollyFrontier - sources,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-hollyfrontier-m-a-tesoro-idUSKCN0Q41WK20150730?type=companyNews

60,"  By Kristen HaysHOUSTON Aug 6 Oil drilling in Utah's Uinta Basin has ""dried up"" in light of low crude prices, and will affect availability of the waxy crude prevalent there, Tesoro Corp Chief Executive Greg Goff  told analysts on Thursday.Tesoro recently finished a $275 million conversion project at its 57,500 barrel-per-day (bpd) refinery in Salt Lake City, Utah, to double waxy crude processing capacity to 22,000 bpd.Goff said the plant can run other types of crude, and Tesoro is working to forecast waxy crude availability.""In the short term the economics that were originally behind the project are not as attractive as they were when we spent the money,"" Goff said during Tesoro's quarterly earnings call. Uinta trades at a discount to the U.S. crude benchmark, West Texas Intermediate, as it is more costly to produce, process and transport because it must be heated to flow and most moves by truck. As domestic crude prices plunged 58 percent from last year's triple-digit highs, that discount narrowed, prompting producers to pull back and focus on other more profitable oilfields.Baker Hughes Inc says drilling rigs in Utah fell to 4 last week from 24 a year ago, having declined since January. Newfield Exploration Co, the biggest Uinta oil producer, ceased drilling there earlier this year to cut costs.The Utah Department of Natural Resources said 2014 output in  Duchesne and Uintah counties - the centers of Uinta output - reached 32.9 million barrels in 2014, or 80.5 percent of the state's total. Through April this year output in those counties reached 10.7 million barrels, or 81 percent of the total. Rail shipments of Utah crude to California refineries also fell to nothing in June from 49,318 barrels in January.HollyFrontier Corp is doing a similar conversion project at its Woods Cross refinery in Utah that will increase capacity to 45,000 bpd from 31,000 bpd with ability to process up to 25,000 bpd of Uinta waxy crude.

61,"   By Kristen Hays | HOUSTON  HOUSTON PBF Energy Inc's purchase of Exxon Mobil Corp's California refinery marks Chairman Tom O'Malley's biggest bet yet on U.S. refining in the country's toughest market.The $537.5 million deal to buy Exxon's 155,000 barrels per day plant in Torrance with dock, storage and pipeline infrastructure will mark PBF's entrance into the market in California, where refiners spend more to make a required boutique gasoline blend and face stronger emissions regulations than anywhere else in the country.The state is also isolated without good pipeline connections to the rest of the country. So it is increasingly dependent on costlier foreign crude imports as output in California and Alaska decline, putting California refiners at a disadvantage relative to U.S. peers who can easily tap domestic oil.O'Malley, a legendary refiner, formed PBF in 2008 to buy U.S refineries and started with two in Delaware and New Jersey that Valero Energy Corp wanted to shed. East Coast refiners struggled, and some shut down, stuck with paying more for imports while peers in the Midwest and Gulf Coast reaped big profits on cheap and accessible shale oil.But the rise of crude-by-rail after his acquisitions let PBF and other surviving East Coast refiners tap that inland bounty and reduce reliance on imports.    California is a far different animal. Besides the costly mandated gasoline blend and a cap-and-trade system to cut emissions, talk of expanding oil-by-rail draws vehement opposition that grows with every new fiery crude train crash.""There is definitely a lot of pushback in California,"" said John Faulstich of refining consultancy Stillwater Associates. That opposition spreads north to Vancouver, Washington, where Tesoro Corp wants to build a 360,000 bpd railport to load railed-in crude onto vessels to supply West Coast refineries, mainly in California.But even with those issues, Torrance likely was still attractive, experts said.PBF is opening its checkbook wider for Torrance than it has for any other refinery. At $537.5 million for the 155,000 barrels per day plant, PBF is paying $34.67 a barrel - more than $16.72 a barrel it agreed in June to pay for Exxon's joint-venture 192,500 bpd refinery in Chalmette, Louisiana. Tesoro paid $1.18 billion in 2013 for BP Plc's 266,000 bpd refinery - or $44.36 a barrel - but that included a dock capable of handling the biggest oil tankers, storage tanks, pipelines and retail assets. Associated Torrance assets are similar, but do not include retail.Torrance, when running, ""is a gasoline beast,"" Credit Suisse analyst Ed Westlake said in a note to investors. The refinery provides about one-fifth of Southern California's gasoline supply - and 10 percent for the entire state.""Having that sort of market potential is probably something that's enticing them a lot more than any regulatory barriers,"" said Ryan Eggers, supervisor of the transportation fuels unit at the California Energy Commission.Refining margins have been strong on the West Coast this year - largely because Torrance has been out of the mix, hobbled by a February explosion. Tesoro Corp, for example, pocketed $16.73 in profit per barrel of refined products in the second quarter, up from $12.37 per barrel in the same period in 2014. ""If you were operating in California this year and you weren't Exxon, you made a ton of money,"" Faulstich said.Exxon aims to fix the equipment at Torrance, and sources familiar with the plant say the company aims to have that work done by mid-February - a year after the blast.  PBF said the plant would be ""restored to full working order"" by the time the deal closes in the second quarter 2016.

Shares of Tesoro, the benchmark's top performer during that period, are up 62 percent, followed by those of No. 2 performer Valero, up 40 percent.Falling oil prices tend to benefit refiners because they purchase crude as a feedstock for their refineries, which churn out valuable fuels such as gasoline and diesel.But portfolio managers say another reason they are interested in the sector is that the management teams at top U.S. refiners have become disciplined about their capital spending plans and are returning more cash to shareholders. ""The group has found religion, especially with capital deployment,"" said George Maris, manager of the $2 billion Janus Global Select Fund, which owned $39 million worth of Valero stock at the end of June.

68,"   By Kristen Hays | HOUSTON  HOUSTON A Washington state council on Tuesday released a massive government review of Tesoro Corp's proposed $210 million railport, the latest milestone in the company's hopes to build the largest oil-by-rail terminal in the United States.The 360,000 barrels-per-day project would move domestic and Canadian crude via train to Washington's Port of Vancouver on the Columbia River, where it would be transferred to vessels to feed West Coast refineries, largely in California.Tesoro had originally targeted late 2014 for startup, but the lengthy state review and growing opposition in light of multiple fiery crude train crashes since mid-2013 led to repeated delays.Tuesday's release of Washington's Energy Facility Site Evaluation Council (EFSEC)'s draft environmental impact statement on the project opened a 45-day stretch for public comment. After that, the council will submit its final report and recommendation to Gov. Jay Inslee, who has the final decision on whether it will be built. The report, which exceeds 1,000 pages including lists of resources used to compile it, does not take a position on the project. Instead, it examines its purpose, potential environmental impacts and how to mitigate them, safety considerations and other aspects.The report said all tank railcars that move crude to the proposed facility must meet the latest federal standards announced earlier this year with thicker hulls, steel shields on the front and back, and protections for valves and fittings where crude goes in the top and drains out the bottom.This year Tesoro received 210 so-called pressure railcars with more reinforcements designed to contain flammable liquid petroleum gas. The railport as proposed can receive up to four oil trains per day. According to Tesoro, it will receive mainly North Dakota Bakken and diluted Canadian heavy crude. It also could take shipments from other U.S. shale oilfields in Wyoming and Colorado as well as waxy crude from the Uinta Basin in Utah.The report also said that if the project is rejected, West Coast refineries could still tap North American crude via rail and pipelines where available as well as truck. Global Partners LP is expanding an oil and ethanol railport about 50 miles west across the river in Clatskanie, Oregon, where the state did not require such a lengthy and detailed review to receive permits.

78,"   By Kristen Hays | HOUSTON  HOUSTON On the heels of last month's Paris agreement to curb carbon emissions, independent refiner Tesoro Corp said it is working with several biofuel companies to run more crude made from renewable plants and waste at its California refineries, the company told Reuters on Tuesday.Using so-called biocrude from Fulcrum BioEnergy Inc and other partners is intended to lower Tesoro's costs to comply with California's Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS), which requires refineries to run more environmentally friendly produced crude.Rather than build or overhaul units to produce biofuels, Tesoro can blend biocrude into other crudes that feed existing refineries to generate LCFS credits, C.J. Warner, executive vice president of strategy and business development, said.Fuels made from the mix would be ""indistinguishable"" from current output, requiring no changes or upgrades to pipelines, fuel pumps or vehicles, she said.Tesoro also aims to satisfy federal Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) requirements to produce fuels made from biomass.Initially, the amount would be 1 percent or less of the combined 546,000 barrels per day of crude Tesoro's Los Angeles and San Francisco refineries can process. Warner said it will take time for the biocrude suppliers to increase output to a commercial scale. The California Air Resources Board and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency also must grant approvals before suppliers can move forward.In the meantime, Tesoro can work with the biocrude to ensure its addition to crude mixes have the right chemical makeup to run properly at the refineries.""It's another reason to get started now. There are a lot of things for us to do before we get this running at significant volumes,"" Warner said. It may be a while before consumers can put fuel made in part from biocrude in their gasoline tanks.Tesoro has a deal with Fulcrum BioEnergy to provide biocrude made from municipal solid waste at its $266 million, 10 million gallons per year Sierra plant under development near Reno, Nevada, expected to start up in 2018, the company said. The U.S. Department of Agriculture in 2014 awarded Fulcrum a $105 million loan guarantee to build the plant. Tesoro also is working with Ensyn Corp, which operates a 3 million gallon per-year biomass plant in Ontario.That plant has been qualified by the EPA to generate cellulosic renewable identification numbers (RINs) under the RFS.A third partner is Virent Inc, which also works with Royal Dutch Shell Plc.

98,"   By Jessica Resnick-Ault | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Chevron Corp completed an initial round of bidding on its Burnaby, British Columbia, refinery late last week, three people familiar with the process said on Tuesday.  The refinery, located east of Vancouver, can process 52,000 barrels of oil a day. It does not process bitumen, the heavy, tar-like substance extracted from Canada's oil sands, and so it might be less attractive to Canadian producers, the people said.Chevron said its ""expression of interest process"" is focused on the potential sale of refining and marketing assets in British Columbia, excluding Chevron Canada Ltd’s lubricants business. Tesoro Corp is among the bidders, the people said. The refinery and associated retail gasoline stations are being offered together, making it potentially more attractive for Tesoro, which has a retail arm.A spokeswoman for Tesoro declined to comment, saying the company constantly reviews its portfolio.  Par Pacific Holdings, based in Houston, which was seen as a possible contender for the plant, is not pursuing the refinery, according to one of the people. Reuters previously reported that Chevron had retained Goldman Sachs to sell the plant. Chevron is currently divesting several smaller refineries that are not seen as core assets. Chevron is expected to close on a sale of its Kapolei, Hawaii, refinery to One Rock Capital Partners on Nov. 1, according to two of the people. Chevron is also seeking a buyer for a refinery in South Africa.

The largest refining acquisition since 2011, announced earlier on Thursday, will make Tesoro the fourth-biggest U.S. refiner by capacity. The acquisition fills a hole in Tesoro's portfolio by giving it access to pipelines and refineries that connect to Texas' lucrative Permian shale basin. In the formation, lower-cost drilling has helped boost activity substantially as production has rebounded in 2016 after a two-year rout. The Permian was one of the best-performing shale formations during crude's two-year price rout. This year is expected to be the weakest for U.S. refiners since 2011, when the shale revolution began, due to sinking margins for converting crude to fuel. Access to the region and exposure to its growth is expected to be a boon for Tesoro. ""It fills a gap in Tesoro's midstream business; they didn't have any Permian exposure,"" said Sam Margolin, an analyst at Cowen & Co. Western's primary business in the formation is gathering - collecting oil from remote fields, pooling it together and bringing it to a hub, he said. The company also processes Permian oil at its El Paso, Texas, refinery.The acquisition adds refineries in the Southwest and upper Midwest as well as pipelines and gathering systems in basins besides the Permian, such as the Bakken in North Dakota. Oil rigs operating in the United States hit a seven-year low of 318 rigs in May. Since then, the number has increased by more than 130 rigs, with 85 of those added in the Permian alone, according to Baker Hughes data. Nearly half of the United States' operating oil rigs are in the Permian. The Permian Basin, located primarily in western Texas, has the lowest break-even costs of the major U.S. shale formations, making drilling there more lucrative and exposure to the basin critical. Some wells are considered profitable with oil trading as low as $30 a barrel, according to Pioneer Natural Resources, a major driller there.As oil production in the Delaware basin - a subsection of the Permian - comes online in the next two to three years, outpacing pipeline infrastructure and driving up profit, Western is well-positioned, the company's CEO, Jeff Stevens, told analysts on a conference call.Tesoro's acquisition reflects the conviction that refiners with pipelines and other logistical assets can be profitable through volatile price cycles of crude oil and refined products. ""The combined scale with the addition of Western's assets will improve our domestic crude oil supply opportunities, and should increase working capital efficiencies for both crude oil and refined products,"" said Greg Goff, Tesoro's chief executive since 2010, said on the call. The company's scale will also help brace against challenges in the sector, analysts said. Goff had expanded the company's portfolio even before Thursday's deal, buying two refineries, three logistics units and a biofuels firm. The deal is the biggest in the sector since 2011, when refiners Holly Corp and Frontier Oil merged.  Western Refining shareholders will receive 0.4350 Tesoro share for each share they own, or $37.30 in cash. The offer is a 22 percent premium to Western's close on Wednesday at $30.50.The total deal is valued at about $6.4 billion, including about $1.7 billion of Western Refining's debt and $605 million for a noncontrolling interest in Western Refining Logistics LP (WNRL.N).
