0,"  * Bank of America shares jump after earnings* Empire State manufacturing index, PPI increase* Fastenal shares plunge after earnings miss expectations* Dow up 0.8 pct, S&P 500 up 0.6 pct, Nasdaq up 0.8 pctBy Ryan VlastelicaNEW YORK, Jan 15 U.S. stocks rose on Wednesday, with the S&P 500 climbing to an all-time high after strong earnings from Bank of America and data signaled that the economy is improving.Bank of America Corp climbed 2.5 percent to $17.19 as one of the biggest boosts to the S&P after the second-largest U.S. bank said its quarterly profit surged by nearly $3 billion on an increase in revenue. The report comes a day after both JPMorgan Chase & Co  and Wells Fargo & Co also posted better-than-expected earnings, though Wells Fargo's mortgage lending slowed to the lowest level in five years.""So far so good with bank earnings this season, and it is very positive that we're seeing significant declines in foreclosures, which is very positive for the economy,"" said David Kelly, chief global strategist for JPMorgan Funds in New York.In the latest economic data, the seasonally adjusted Producer Price Index rose 0.4 percent last month, the biggest increase since June, although inflation pressures remained benign. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York's ""Empire State"" index of general business conditions climbed to its highest level in 20 months.The data reassured investors that the economy is able to stand on its own even as the Federal Reserve begins to slow its massive stimulus programs, which contributed to huge equity gains in 2013. Wall Street's rally on Wednesday erased some of 2014's early weakness, putting major indexes near break-even levels for the year. In its latest Beige Book report on business activity, the Fed said the economy grew at a moderate pace from late November through the end of 2013, with some regions of the country expecting a pickup in growth.""The general trend of economic numbers is pretty positive, and helping to get people over the shock of the recent weak payroll report,"" said Kelly, who helps oversee $400 billion in assets. ""An improving economy is a trend of 2014, and that will be good for equities throughout the year.""The Dow Jones industrial average was up 122.95 points, or 0.75 percent, at 16,496.81. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index was up 10.23 points, or 0.56 percent, at 1,849.11. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 31.88 points, or 0.76 percent, at 4,214.89. As its session peak, the S&P 500 climbed to 1,850.84, a record intraday high for the benchmark index.Trading will probably be driven by earnings as the season continues. With only 5 percent of the S&P 500 having reported results so far, 52 percent of companies have topped earnings expectations, according to Thomson Reuters data, a rate that is below the historical average of 63 percent.Tesla Motors Inc rose 3.7 percent to $167.20 a day after the electric car maker said that deliveries of its Model S sedan in the fourth quarter sharply exceeded what the company had forecast.SolarCity Corp gained 4.5 percent to $68.48 after the top U.S. solar installer unveiled a plan to allow investors, including individuals, to invest in its rooftop solar systems.Shares of Chelsea Therapeutics soared after an advisory panel to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration concluded on Tuesday that the company's drug to treat a rare form of low blood pressure is effective enough to warrant regulatory approval. The stock jumped 92.6 percent to $4.43.On the downside, Fastenal Co slid 5.1 percent to $45.73 as the S&P 500's biggest decliner after the industrial and construction supply company reported fourth-quarter earnings below expectations.",2014-01-15,FAST,"Wed Jan 15, 2014 | 3:00pm EST",US STOCKS-Wall St advances after strong bank results and data,http://www.reuters.com//article/markets-usa-stocks-idUSL2N0KP1MS20140115?type=companyNews

2,"  (Updates column published Friday with U.S. stock indexes' weekly percentage gains)By Angela MoonNEW YORK, July 6 With all the hoopla over the Dow topping 17,000 out of the way, the market's next focus will be whether the fast-approaching earnings season can justify U.S. stocks climbing further into record territory.Many factors point to second-quarter earnings poised to surprise substantially to the upside. There is a slight chance that profits for S&P 500 companies could return to double-digit growth for the first time in nearly three years.After Thursday's strong U.S. employment report, some economists have begun talking up prospects for a 4.0 percent annual growth rate in gross domestic product for the April-through-June period, a dramatic snap back from the first quarter's contraction of 2.9 percent.""It's a strong report that capped off a strong quarter. Everything in the report points to 4 percent growth in the second quarter,"" said Stuart Hoffman, chief economist at PNC Financial Services in Pittsburgh, referring to June's jobs data.Analysts polled by Reuters are calling for earnings growth for the second quarter of 6.2 percent, and a return to double digits in the third and fourth quarters: 10.9 percent and 11.9 percent, respectively. The last time that S&P 500 earnings achieved double-digit percentage growth was the third quarter of 2011, when the rate was 18 percent.But some signs suggest the 10 percent handle could be breached a quarter earlier by the time all of the second-quarter numbers are in. ""There is a chance that earnings could see double digits this quarter, but only a very slim chance. The strong jobs report can translate to better earnings after a period of time, but it can't be immediate,"" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer at Solaris Group in Bedford Hills, New York.This week, aluminum producer Alcoa Inc will get the earnings season started on Tuesday with second-quarter results after the closing bell. Family Dollar Stores, Inc will report quarterly results on Thursday. On Friday, earnings will be released by Fastenal Co, a supplier to the construction and manufacturing industries, and Wells Fargo & Co , the largest U.S. mortgage lender.SIGNS OF THINGS TO COME  First among the encouraging signs of profit growth: Earnings pre-announcements have the most positive skew in six quarters.Of 133 pre-announcements from S&P 500 components so far, 97 have been negative, 24 positive and 12 in line with existing forecasts, according to Thomson Reuters data. That puts the negative-to-positive ratio at 4-to-1 for the second quarter, the lowest since the fourth quarter of 2012. Moreover, that compares with 5.9-to-1 in the first quarter and 5.5-to-1 a year earlier in the second quarter of 2013.Second, actual earnings growth tends to exceed forecast growth by a sizable margin because companies and the analysts who track them tend to underestimate profits.Since 2009's fourth quarter when profit growth returned after the recession, actual S&P 500 earnings growth at the end of each quarterly cycle has exceeded the growth forecast at the start of each reporting period by an average of 5.7 percentage points. Even factoring out the outsized profit growth rates in the first six quarters following the recession, earnings have come in an average of nearly 3 percentage points higher than the forecast at the start of each reporting season.For the first quarter, for example, the profit growth rate on April 1 was pegged at 2.1 percent. When the numbers from all 500 companies in the index were tallied, though, growth was actually 5.6 percent.With the Dow and the S&P 500 in record territory and an S&P 500 price-to-earnings ratio of 15.6, the highest in nine years, a substantial break to the upside on earnings would be a welcome development for investors.On Thursday, the Dow Jones industrial average closed above the 17,000 milestone for the first time, and the Standard & Poor's 500 came within 1 percent of piercing through 2,000. For the short week, the Dow rose 1.3 percent, the S&P 500 gained 1.25 percent and the Nasdaq advanced 2 percent. The U.S. stock market was closed on Friday for the Fourth of July holiday.For the year, the Dow is up 3 percent for the year, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq are both up 7.4 percent.""We've had such a big move to this point that good data just isn't enough to drive this market much further. It's really coming down to company earnings. That's the only thing left that can lead this market higher,"" said Rick Meckler, president of  LibertyView Capital Management, an investment advisory firm in Jersey City, New Jersey.(Reporting by Angela Moon; Additional reporting by Richard Leong; Editing by Dan Burns and Jan Paschal)",2014-07-06,FAST,"Sun Jul 6, 2014 | 5:31pm EDT",UPDATE 2-Wall St Week Ahead-Double-digit profit growth may return in Q2,http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-stocks-weekahead-idUSL2N0PF0PA20140706?type=companyNews
3,"  * Indexes on track for worst week since April* Fastenal reports revenue below expectations* Futures up: Dow 26 pts, S&P 2.75 pts, Nasdaq 10.25 ptsBy Ryan VlastelicaNEW YORK, July 11 U.S. stock index futures were modestly higher on Friday, indicating a rebound from recent losses, though major indexes remained on track for their biggest weekly decline since April.* The S&P 500 has fallen for three of the past four sessions, dropping Thursday on concerns over the financial health of Portugal's top listed bank. Still, steady gains this year have left equities near record levels, and investors have used any uncertainty as an opportunity to take profits. * The second-quarter earnings season will be in focus. While few companies have reported so far, next week will bring the results of dozens of highly watched names, including several Dow components.* Early reports, including from Alcoa Inc, have been positive, though investors continue to watch for signs of revenue growth and confirmation that the economy rebounded in the second quarter after a dismal start to the year. * Fastenal Co reported second-quarter revenue that was below expectations. Late Thursday, Chevron Corp forecast rising second-quarter earnings as asset sales in Chad and elsewhere offset spiking currency charges.* S&P 500 e-mini futures rose 2.75 points and were above fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract. Dow Jones industrial average e-mini futures  rose 26 points and Nasdaq 100 e-mini futures rose 10.25 points.* For the week, the Dow is down 0.9 percent, the S&P is down 1 percent and the Nasdaq is down 2 percent. It is the biggest weekly decline for all three indexes since the week ended April 11. The CBOE Volatility index is up 22 percent this week, its biggest weekly spike since March. * In a cautious signal, the S&P closed under its 14-day moving average on Thursday, a sign of weak near-term momentum.* European shares rose 0.3 percent but were on track for a weekly decline of 2.9 percent. Portugal's Banco Espirito Santo steadied market jitters by reassuring investors over financial troubles at its biggest shareholder, though investors were in the dark about any potential losses.* In company news, Whirlpool Corp agreed to buy 66.8 percent of voting stock of Italy's Indesit Company SpA  for about $1.03 billion.* Westmoreland Coal Co fell in premarket trading a day after it said a public offering of 1.5 million shares was priced at $35.50 each, a discount to its Thursday closing price of $37.
