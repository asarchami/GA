0,"   By Esha Dey  Israel's Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (TEVA.TA) (TEVA.N) offered to buy U.S. neurology drugs maker NuPathe Inc PATH.O for $114 million plus milestone payments related to NuPathe's Zecuity migraine treatment.Teva's offer of $3.65 per share comes less than a month after Endo Health Solutions Inc (ENDP.O) said it would buy NuPathe for about $105 million, or $2.85 per share, plus milestone payments.Both Endo and Teva are offering NuPathe up to $3.15 per share in milestone payments related to Zecuity.Excluding milestone payments, Teva's offer represents a premium of 13 percent to NuPathe's Tuesday close.NuPathe shares were up 37 percent at $4.42 in late morning trading on Wednesday.""After review and discussion, the company board determined that the Teva proposal is reasonably expected to lead to a superior proposal,"" NuPathe said in a filing, adding that it planned to discuss the offer with Teva. However, analysts said that while Teva offered more up front, its milestone payments were based on Zecuity sales levels that were unlikely to be reached.Teva's offer would give NuPathe shareholders 85 cents per share when annual sales of Zecuity reach $100 million, another $1.00 when sales reach $300 million and $1.30 more when sales hit $450 million.Under the Endo offer, NuPathe shareholders would receive $2.15 per share when Zecuity sales exceed $100 million. The rest would be earned if sales exceed $300 million. ""I almost feel like (Teva's final milestone) is out there just for fun, because I don't really believe (Zecuity is) going to get to $450 million,"" Stifel Nicolaus and Co analyst Annabel Samimy said.""In terms of certain sales, I think Endo wins. In terms of the next tier, I think that is where the uncertainty comes in.""Zecuity, approved in the United States last January, is the only prescription migraine patch approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Its sales are estimated to reach about $181 million by 2018, according to Thomson Reuters data. The single-use, battery-powered patch delivers a commonly used migraine drug, sumatriptan, to treat both headaches and migraine-related nausea.Applied to the upper arm or thigh during a migraine attack, it delivers a 6.5 mg dose of sumatriptan through the skin over four hours.Migraine headaches, a neurological disorder, affect about 12 percent of the U.S. population.Analysts have said Zecuity could be a strategic fit for Teva and Endo, both of which offer multiple pain treatments.Endo was not immediately available for comment.(Reporting by Esha Dey in Bangalore; Editing by Don Sebastian and Saumyadeb Chakrabarty)",2014-01-08,ENDP,"Wed Jan 8, 2014 | 12:30pm EST",NuPathe gets takeover offer from Israel's Teva,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-nupathe-offer-teva-idUSBREA070OH20140108?type=companyNews

20,"   By Ankur Banerjee  Endo International Plc (ENDP.O) said Chief Executive Rajiv De Silva had stepped down and would be replaced by generics division head Paul Campanelli, as the drugmaker grapples with a large debt load and mounting pressure on some of its drug prices.Endo's shares rose as much as 18 percent to $23.98 on Friday as the company also maintained its full-year profit and revenue forecasts.Campanelli joined Endo in 2015 following the company's $8-billion acquisition of generic drugs maker Par Pharmaceutical, where he was CEO since 2012.At Endo, Campanelli headed the generic and OTC drugs business, which accounted for about 60 percent of the company's total revenue through the first half of 2016.Under De Silva, a former senior executive at Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc (VRX.TO), Endo embarked on a strategy of acquisition-fueled growth, drawing comparisons with the Canadian drugmaker.Valeant became a poster child for perceived flaws in the business model of specialty pharmaceutical companies as it came under intense scrutiny from politicians and regulators for its reliance on acquisitions and price hikes to juice growth. Analysts said Campanelli's appointment underscores the growing importance of Endo's generics business, adding that the transition could mark a shift in focus to operational execution from acquisition-led growth.""The news doesn't come as a surprise given Endo's stock performance and strategic shift toward a generic-focused portfolio,"" Leerink Partners analyst Jason Gerberry wrote in a client note.Up to Thursday's close of $20.26, Endo's shares had lost about 67 percent this year - the worst performer on the S&P 500 healthcare index .SPXHC. Reuters reported in June that Endo had held discussions with private equity firms about potential asset sales to reduce its more than $8 billion debt pile.Mizuho analyst Irina Koffler said the management's increased focus on differentiated assets rather than on growing scale is likely to make Endo more attractive to strategic buyers and could result in additional divestitures.""We continue to believe that Endo may be restructured and eventually sold to a larger generic player, which may be easier to achieve under new management,"" Koffler said. Endo, which offers a suite of specialty, generic and over-the-counter medical products, is also being investigated for its relationships with pharmacy benefit managers and marketing of its opioid painkiller Opana ER.The company agreed in March to stop marketing Opana ER pill as crush-resistant and stop downplaying the risks of addiction associated with the narcotic.  Endo's shares were up 15.3 percent at $23.35 on Friday.
