0,"  (Corrects with annual USDA slaughter figures paragraph nine)* Spread of deadly pig virus has tightened U.S. hog supply* An estimated 4 mln-5 mln pigs have died of virus in past 10 months* Disease does not affect humans, not a food safety risk* More processors likely to curtail slaughter operations in futureBy Meredith Davis and Christine StebbinsMarch 14 Smithfield Foods Inc, the world's largest pork processor, suspended hog slaughter at its Tar Heel, North Carolina, plant on Friday because of the spread of the deadly Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea virus (PEDv) which has tightened hog supplies, industry sources said.The Tar Heel plant, the company's largest pork processing facility, reduced its slaughter schedule this week to four days from five days, said the sources, who have knowledge of the plant's operations and hog purchases. They requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue. While it is not slaughtering hogs on Friday, the plant is processing meat from this week's kill, the persons said.Smithfield, acquired last year by China's Shuanghui International, said it does not comment on daily operations, minor disruptions, and openings or closings of processing plants.Friday's move follows days of market talk about U.S. pork processors cutting back working days because of reduced supplies, a measure that reflects the growing damage caused the virus. It is not clear how long the company will adhere to the shortened slaughter schedule. Smithfield may also reduce operations at its plant in Clinton, North Carolina, the sources said.The Tar Heel plant is the largest pork processing plant in the United States, with an estimated slaughter capacity of 30,000 to 34,000 hogs a day.Smithfield's decision to reduce the kill schedule in response to the hog virus is expected to be repeated by other companies in the weeks ahead as U.S. pork processors struggle to source hogs, analysts said.The United States, the world's largest pork exporter, slaughtered some 112 million hogs in 2013, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The pig virus has spread across the U.S. Hog Belt with swine specialists estimating that at least 4 million to 5 million hogs have died of PEDv since it was identified in the United States in May 2013.PEDv does not affect humans and is not a food safety risk.The tight supply of hogs was reflected in the U.S. government's weekly slaughter estimates on Friday. The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimated Friday's hog slaughter at 360,000 head, down 51,000 head from a week ago.The USDA estimated hog slaughter so far this year down 3.5 percent from the same period a year ago.""I think that kind of operating approach, cutting one day a week, is possibly coming to some Midwest plants in May,"" said Steve Meyer, livestock economist at Paragon Economics.Plants owned by Hormel Foods Corp, JBS Swift , and Triumph Foods are among Midwestern facilities  that plan either to  trim daily operations by a couple of hours, eliminate overtime or suspend Saturday slaughter, according to sources in the cash hog market.

1,"  (Recasts, adds analysts' views, updates shares)By Devika  Krishna KumarJune 5 J.M. Smucker Co forecast full-year profit above estimates as sales increased in its domestic consumer food business - which includes peanut butter and cooking oils - and despite rising coffee costs.The company's coffee business, which includes the Folgers and Dunkin Donuts brands, is its largest by revenue.Smucker, the biggest U.S. roaster, was forced to cut prices of packaged coffee earlier this year when arabica coffee prices plunged.But arabica prices have jumped nearly 90 percent in three months, allowing Smucker to raise list prices for the first time since 2011 on most of its U.S. packaged coffee.The company, which also makes Jif peanut butter and Crisco oils, forecast full-year adjusted earnings of $5.95-$6.05 per share. It expects sales to rise about 5 percent, implying revenue of about $5.9 billion. Analysts on average were expecting earnings of $5.98 on revenue of $5.77 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Profit in the company's domestic consumer food business  rose 6 percent to $95.7 million in the fourth quarter ended April 30, the company said on Thursday.Smucker said it expects its peanut-butter business to be the key contributor to earnings in its consumer foods business in 2015 as it enters into new contracts at lower prices. The company failed to benefit from a drop in peanut prices last year as it had signed long-term peanut purchase contracts unlike rivals such as Hormel Foods Corp, the owner of Skippy peanut butter.Smucker has been struggling to boost sales of its peanut butter and fruit spreads due to rising competition and consumers shifting away from artificially sweetened fruit spreads.Ohio-based Smucker said it expects its K-cups - coffee pods used in Keurig Green Mountain Inc's single coffee brewers - to achieve modest volume growth in 2015. The company's net income fell 9 percent to $118.5 million, or $1.16 per share, in the fourth quarter.Excluding items, profit was $1.21 per share.Net sales fell 8 percent to $1.23 billion, hurt by a 12 percent drop in sales in its U.S. retail coffee business as it cut prices to pass on lower green coffee costs realized during the year.Analysts on average had expected Smucker to earn $1.16 per share on sales of $1.24 billion.Smucker shares were up 1.5 percent at $104.44 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday.

4,"   By Carey Gillam  Jan 30 Processing lines at some U.S. hog slaughterhouses are moving too fast for inspectors to adequately address contamination and food safety concerns, according to an advocacy group that says it has obtained affidavits from four government meat inspectors.In the affidavits, released Friday by the Government Accountability Project, a ""whistle-blower protection"" organization, the inspectors detail experiences inside pork-processing plants participating in a pilot program engineered by the USDA to speed up lines while improving food safety and trim inspection costs.The inspectors, three of whom currently work for the U.S. Department of Agriculture while the fourth recently retired, allege they have seen practices that increase the risk of salmonella contamination of meat on the processing line.They also noted an increased level of contamination of meat with  ""cystic kidneys"" and ""bladder stems"" from the slaughtered animal carcasses.Joe Ferguson, a USDA inspector with 23 years at the agency who retired last year, said in one affidavit that the program is giving too much control over food safety to private industry. The USDA program is a pilot program being conducted in five pork-processing plants.A similar program is in place at U.S. poultry plants, and the labor union representing U.S. poultry inspectors has been battling the USDA in federal court, claiming the new program jeopardizes food safety. Under the program plant operators take on more responsibility for carcass inspection while government inspectors verify the effectiveness of the company's work.Hormel Foods Corp. operates or contracts with three plants piloting the government program, and the GAP group's Food Integrity Campaign said it was launching a petition drive urging Hormel to slow down its processing lines and conduct closer inspections.Hormel said that food safety is a top priority and it has found the government program allows for more efficient and effective oversight. Hormel's facilities meet or exceed USDA standards, the company said. The USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service also states that the new model is more efficient and provides enhanced food safety protection.In November, the USDA issued a report about the hog slaughter inspection program that concluded the plants in the program are performing as well as those not in it.USDA spokeswoman Catherine Cochrain said the USDA has not yet determined whether or not it will expand the program beyond the five pork plants.(Reporting By Carey Gillam; Editing by Alan Crosby)",2015-01-30,HRL,"Fri Jan 30, 2015 | 3:16pm EST","U.S. pork plant program draws criticism, Hormel petition",http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-pork-foodsafety-idUSL1N0V91JR20150130?type=companyNews

7,"   By Tom Polansek | CHICAGO, April 8  CHICAGO, April 8 A U.S. outbreak of a deadly strain of bird flu accelerated on Wednesday with the infection of a sixth turkey flock in Minnesota, the nation's top turkey-producing state, in less than a week.The infected flock of 310,000 turkeys was the ninth case of the H5N2 flu in Minnesota in just over a month and the biggest flock yet to be confirmed with the disease, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The virus was detected at a facility west of Minneapolis that is owned by a subsidiary of Spam maker Hormel Foods Corp, the company said.Since the beginning of the year, the flu, which can kill nearly an entire poultry flock within 48 hours, has also been found in birds from Oregon to Arkansas. The discoveries have prompted major overseas buyers such as Mexico and Canada to limit imports of U.S. poultry and companies such as Tyson Foods Inc to strengthen measures to keep the disease off farms.The number of infections is climbing as migratory ducks, which are believed to be spreading the disease, return to Minnesota to breed after spending the winter farther south, said Beth Thompson, assistant director of the Minnesota Board of Animal Health. The larger number of ducks likely increases the risk for wild birds to transmit the virus. Farm workers are probably infecting turkeys by tracking the virus into barns after stepping in contaminated duck feces, said John Glisson, vice president of research for the U.S. Poultry and Egg Association. Chicken flocks are also vulnerable.""Minnesota is a real hotbed for returning waterfowl,"" Glisson said. The USDA has said it believes migratory ducks are spreading the flu and sent a team to Minnesota to determine how it is moving into poultry flocks.So far, efforts to stop the spread by controlling human and vehicle traffic on farms have not worked. The number of infections may continue to rise through mid-May, when spring migration ends, said Steve Olson, executive director of the Minnesota Turkey Growers Association. New cases may accelerate again in the autumn when recently hatched ducks, which have never been exposed to the virus, begin migrating south, he added.The H5N2 flu will likely remain a threat to U.S. poultry for three to five years, Olson said, citing information from wildlife experts. That is how long it will take wild birds to develop immunity to the disease.No human cases have been detected.

The virus has been identified at a facility west of Minneapolis that is owned by a subsidiary of Hormel. Minnesota, the largest turkey-producing state in the country, has been the hardest hit so far, followed by farms in Arkansas, Missouri, the Dakotas, Wisconsin and Iowa.On Tuesday, Mexico, the biggest buyer of U.S. chicken, halted imports of live birds and eggs from Iowa.Bird flu was found in millions of hens at an egg-laying facility in Iowa on Monday, the worst case so far in the United States.Mexico's agriculture ministry said it and the country's animal health body, SENASICA, had tightened controls and the monitoring of migratory wild birds. It said they were in contact with bird farms in Mexico to detect any domestic cases. Migratory ducks are believed to be spreading the virus,  veterinarians have said. STATE OF EMERGENCY IN WISCONSIN Wisconsin declared a state of emergency on Monday over the  bird flu outbreak, and Governor Scott Walker authorized the state's National Guard to help contain the disease. Walker declared the emergency because three flocks have become infected in the past week, his office said. Guardsmen will help clean infected sites. Wisconsin is among 12 states where the H5N2 flu has been found in poultry since the beginning of the year. The other states are Arkansas, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota and Washington. Another strain, H5N8, has been found in California.On Saturday, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency said preliminary testing had confirmed H5 avian influenza on a second Ontario farm.Earlier this month, Canada confirmed H5 avian influenza on a turkey farm near Woodstock, Ontario.  Hormel's chief executive officer, Jeffrey M. Ettinger, said in a statement on Monday that the company was seeing ""significant challenges"" to its turkey supply chain because of the highly pathogenic avian influenza outbreaks in Wisconsin and Minnesota, where its Hormel and Jennie-O Turkey Store units are based.The company said that while it expected the outbreak to potentially ease as the weather turned warmer, tight meat supplies and operational challenges in its turkey business as a result of the bird flu outbreak would put pressure its earnings.The company said it now expected its fiscal 2015 non-GAAP adjusted earnings to be toward the lower end of its $2.50 to $2.60 per share outlook.Shares of Pilgrim's Pride, Tyson Foods Inc and Sanderson Farms closed down less than 1 percent on Tuesday.

14,"  Hormel Foods Corp, the maker of Spam lunch meat, said it expected sales at its Jennie-O Turkey Store business to fall about 15 percent in the second half of the year, due to a supply shortfall caused by an avian flu outbreak in the United States.However, shares of the company, which reported a better-than-expected second-quarter profit and reaffirmed its full-year profit forecast, rose 4.6 percent to $58.34 on the New York Stock Exchange.The Jennie-O business ended the second quarter facing substantial supply chain challenges, Chief Executive Jeffrey Ettinger said in a statement on Wednesday.""Many of our barns remain empty under quarantine... we will be purchasing some additional meat from external sources but at a higher cost,"" Ettinger said on a post-earning conference call.The company also said it expected the first half of 2016 to be ""somewhat subdued"" for the Jennie-O business.The business, which accounts for about 18 percent of Hormel's revenue, got about 78 percent of its turkeys from its farms in Minnesota and Wisconsin last year. About 5.5 million turkeys and egg-laying chickens have either died from the flu virus or are set to be culled in Minnesota, the largest producer of U.S. turkeys, state officials said this month.The virus has been confirmed in 16 states and Canada, and has devastated Midwestern poultry and egg producers in recent weeks, leading to the culling of 33 million birds.Food distributor Sysco Corp said this month that the outbreak would limit its supply of eggs and chickens that lay them for nine to 18 months, while Post Holdings Inc called the flu a ""force majeure event,"" affecting about 25 percent of its egg supply commitments. Hormel could not say when it would be able to get turkey volumes back to pre-outbreak levels.The company said last month that a fall in turkey supplies would push its full-year adjusted earnings towards the lower end of its forecast range of $2.50-$2.60 per share.Hormel's net income rose to $180.4 million, or 67 cents per share, in the second quarter ended April 26, from $140.7 million, or 52 cents per share, a year earlier, boosted by lower costs in its refrigerated foods business, its biggest.  Net sales rose 1.5 percent to $2.28 billion.Analysts on an average had expected earnings of 62 cents per share and revenue of $2.40 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

15,"   By P.J. Huffstutter | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Hormel Foods' chief executive cast doubt on federal forecasts for as much as 4 percent increase in turkey meat production on Wednesday, due to a devastating outbreak of avian flu that has ""significantly challenged"" its Jennie-O Turkey Store business.The U.S. Department of Agriculture's latest supply projections, released on May 12, forecast domestic turkey production would reach 5.979 billion pounds in 2015, a nearly 3.9 percent increase over last year.But the virulent H5 avian influenza strains continue to spread, reaching 16 states so far. To date, the outbreak has led to the deaths or scheduled euthanizations of more than 38 million birds, including nearly 4.4 million turkeys in Minnesota, the nation's top turkey producer, and more than 650,000 in Wisconsin.""I am skeptical as to the industry's ability to hit that 3 percent to 4 percent gain number,"" Hormel Chief Executive Officer Jeff Ettinger said on Wednesday during a call with analysts.Hormel's Jennie-O business, which accounts for about 18 percent of the company's revenue, drew most of its turkey supply from farms in Minnesota and Wisconsin last year, the company said. It also gets some turkeys from independent suppliers elsewhere. Hormel is one of the leading players in terms of turkey volume production in the United States.""I guess I have a hard time seeing how those numbers happen, if we are going to be short 20 percent in terms of at least turkeys coming into our system, and about 15 percent net of the meat we are going to buy,"" Ettinger said. Nationwide, at least 4 percent of the total U.S. turkey flock has been impacted by the outbreak, and about 8.5 percent of U.S. egg-laying hens, according to industry data.Farmers and some trade groups have expressed concern that, with Thanksgiving just seven months away, they may be running out of time to raise enough turkeys - the traditional centerpiece of holiday feasts - to meet the demand. [IN:nL4N0XV3DW]The economic impact is already being felt in the egg industry, with rising prices and tightening supplies. And Tyson Foods Inc Chief Executive Donnie Smith said on Wednesday that price hikes could be expected in deli products, too. ""Certainly that will have an impact on turkey lunch meat prices,"" Smith said at the BMO Farm to Market Conference in New York.Hormel shares were up over 4 percent on Wednesday after reporting better-than-expected results for the quarter ending April 26.

20,"  (Adds details, background, shares)May 26 Hormel Foods Corp said it would buy natural and organic meat processor Applegate Farms LLC for about $775 million to cater to an increasing demand for food free of antibiotics, hormones and artificial additives.Shares of Hormel, the maker of Spam lunch meat, rose 3.3 percent in extended trading on Tuesday.Major food companies are trying to shed artificial additives from their well-known brands to create healthier products.Larger rival Tyson Foods Inc said in April it plans to end the use of human antibiotics in its chicken by 2017. Last Friday, mass retailer Wal-Mart Stores Inc  issued guidelines to its meat, seafood, dairy and egg suppliers to reduce the use of antibiotics in their products.Applegate, whose sausages, bacon and other products are free of antibiotics and hormones, will operate as a standalone unit of Hormel's refrigerated foods business, Hormel said on Tuesday. Hormel said Applegate's selling shareholders were its founder Stephen McDonnell and Swander Pace Capital.McDonnell will serve as an adviser while Kerry Collins will continue as CEO for the ""next several months,"" Applegate said. Bridgewater, New Jersey-based Applegate's 2015 annual sales are expected to be about $340 million, Hormel said. It expects the transaction to add by about 7-8 cents per share to earnings in fiscal 2016.Credit Suisse was Hormel's financial adviser and Faegre Baker Daniels its legal counsel. Goldman Sachs & Co is financial advisor to Applegate and Ballard Spahr LLP and Fried Frank are its legal counsel.Shares of Hormel closed at $56.61 on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday.

It is limited to 16.3 ounce jars with a ""Best If Used By"" date of DEC1416LR1 with a package UPC code of 37600-10500. The jars were sent to distribution centers for Publix, Target and Walmart located in Georgia, Virginia, Alabama, North Carolina, South Carolina, Delaware and Arkansas, Hormel said. A Hormel spokesman said in an email that the metal shavings entered the jars because of an equipment malfunction that has since then been repaired. Foodborne objects that are greater than 7 mm (1/4 inch) in length may cause injury such as severe choking with airway obstruction, gastrointestinal perforation or secondary infection.

26,"   By Danny Na | CHICAGO  CHICAGO The U.S. Agriculture Department is reviewing the authenticity of a video that allegedly shows animals being beaten and feces-covered pigs at a hog slaughterhouse that supplies SPAM-maker Hormel Foods, and plans to investigate if the video proves to be real, the agency said on Wednesday.The 3:41-minute video was released on Wednesday by animal activist group Compassion Over Killing. The group says the video shows workers at a Quality Pork Processors (QPP) plant in Minnesota beating, dragging and slitting the throats of live animals that writhe in apparent pain. Federal law requires livestock be stunned unconscious before killing.The QPP slaughterhouse is one of five in a pilot project run by the USDA allowing plants to run at increased speeds but with reduced government oversight.The plant processes 19,000 hogs a day, according to the company's website. It exclusively supplies Hormel, one of the nation's leading producers of processed meat and pork products, whose other brands include Applegate natural and organic meats and Farmer John meats. Privately held QPP and Hormel could not be immediately reached for comment on Wednesday. Both QPP and Hormel are based in Austin, Minnesota.The Agriculture Department's Food Safety Inspection Service (FSIS) plans to ""aggressively investigate the case and take appropriate action"" if the film's authenticity is verified, it said in a statement. ""The actions depicted in the video under review are completely unacceptable,"" it added.In one scene of the video, pigs covered in feces or pus-filled abscesses are sent down the plant's conveyor belt. Erica Meier, executive director of Compassion Over Killing, told Reuters the video was filmed by a contractor, who took a job at the plant a few months ago. The group gave an unedited version to the USDA in late October, she said.The FSIS said the actions in the video may have taken place out of view of federal inspectors, who were on duty at other locations at the plant.Had such actions been seen by inspectors, the agency said, they would have resulted in immediate regulatory action against the plant. Animal rights groups have launched numerous undercover investigations of farms and processing plants. An exposé in August by Mercy For Animals of a Tennessee farm where workers were stabbing, clubbing and stomping on chickens led McDonald's Corp and Tyson Foods to sever ties with the farm.Meier said the USDA's pilot program - known as HACCP-Based Inspection Models Project (HIMP) - took inspectors away from the area being filmed.
