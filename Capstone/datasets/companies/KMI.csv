0,"  NEW YORK Jan 3 The New York Federal Reserve Bank filed a motion on Friday to dismiss a lawsuit brought by a former employee who claimed she was fired after refusing to alter a critical examination of Goldman Sachs Group Inc.The ex-employee, Carmen Segarra, said after examining Goldman's legal and compliance divisions for seven months, she found the bank did not have policies to prevent conflicts of interest as required by regulation.In a 30-page court document, lawyers for the New York Fed said some of Segarra's claims were ""implausible owing to numerous contradictions within her pleading.""""Most glaringly, the allegation that Goldman Sachs did not  have any conflict of interest policy is belied by plaintiff's own exhibits, which show that the 'nonexistent' policies were, in fact, available on Goldman Sachs's public website,"" the document said. Attorneys who filed the motion in federal court in the Southern District of New York and Segarra's lawyer, Linda Stengle, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A Goldman Sachs spokesperson also did not respond to a request for comment. According to Segarra's lawsuit, the New York Fed's Legal Compliance and Risk team voted to downgrade Goldman's annual rating pertaining to policies and procedures as a result of  findings. She alleges that two New York Fed officials overseeing the Wall Street bank, Michael Silva and his deputy Michael Koh, were concerned a downgrade would hurt the Goldman's business.Both Koh and Silva are named as defendants in Segarra's lawsuit, as well as her former supervisor, Johnathon Kim. Segarra was assigned to Goldman's legal and compliance divisions from October 2011 until May 2012, and looked into three controversial transactions related to Solyndra, Capmark and the merger of El Paso and Kinder Morgan Inc. At that point, Kim, Silva and Koh fired her and had her escorted from the building by security guards after weeks of disputes and pressure to change her examination findings, the lawsuit said.The case is Segarra v.

11,"  July 31 Kinder Morgan Energy Partners LP  said natural gas distribution companies in New England have agreed to buy firm gas on the U.S. energy company's proposed new pipeline into the region.A shortage of gas pipelines into New England forced energy firms there to pay record prices for gas supplies to heat homes and run a growing number of gas-fired power plants in the region during the recent unusually long and cold winter.The New England utilities agreed to transport about 0.5 billion cubic feet per day of long-term firm transportation on the proposed Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co (TGP) Northeast Energy Direct Project, Kinder Morgan said in a release on Wednesday.Included in the utility group are UIL Holdings Corp's  Berkshire Gas Co, Connecticut Natural Gas Corp and Southern Connecticut Gas Co, NiSource Inc's Columbia Gas of Massachusetts, Algonquin Power & Utilities Corp's  Liberty Utilities Corp, National Grid Plc, and three other utilities. Kinder said it was continuing negotiations with additional customers and expected to announce agreements soon.""Multiple studies continue to suggest there is a need for up to 2 billion cubic feet per day of new pipeline capacity into New England and neighboring markets,"" Kinder Morgan Natural Gas Pipelines East Region President Kimberly Watson said in the release. The Northeast Energy Direct project can provide up to 2.2 bcf of gas per day depending on final customer commitments, Kinder Morgan said. The project, which will connect New England to the Marcellus shale gas fields in Pennsylvania, will include new pipelines and equipment in Pennsylvania, New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Hampshire and Rhode Island.Kinder said it plans to begin the pre-filing process with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in September 2014, with the project expected to begin service in November 2018, subject to regulatory approvals.The Tennessee Gas Pipeline is a 13,900-mile (22,370-kilometer) pipeline that transports gas from Louisiana, the Gulf of Mexico and South Texas to the northeastern United States, including New York City and Boston.

12,"  (Adds details on deal, concerns about MLPs, background)Aug 10 Top U.S. pipeline company Kinder Morgan Inc said on Sunday it will put all its publicly traded units under one roof  in a $70 billion deal that responds to investor concerns about its growth prospects and complicated financial structure.The oil and gas pipeline company said it would shed the tax-advantaged legal structure it had popularized during the U.S. shale boom, the Master Limited Partnership (MLP), and fold its units into one company with a market capitalization of $92 billion organized as a C-corporation.The affected units include Kinder Morgan Energy Partners LP , Kinder Morgan Management, and El Paso Pipeline Partners.Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Rich Kinder had been under pressure from investors and last month on Kinder Morgan Partners' second-quarter earnings call said combinations of the Kinder companies were being evaluated. A source familiar with the deal said Kinder Morgan's overall valuation had suffered because it traded as four entities and the market struggled to understand it.The MLP structure also required the units to hand over much their cash to general partners, hurting its ability to make acquisitions that will now be easier to carry out, the source added.More broadly, MLPs have been coming under greater scrutiny. The Internal Revenue Service this year halted approvals for new ones that strayed from the traditional pipeline model, while some investors have said their weak corporate governance standards expose minority investors to added risks. The company expects the deal to close by the end of the year.""This combined entity will be the largest energy infrastructure company in North America and the third largest energy company overall,"" CEO Kinder said in a statement. In a July note to clients, analysts at Houston-based investment bank Tudor, Pickering Holt said the Kinder companies had underperformed for the last two years, held back by a ""stubbornly high cost of capital"" even though since 2012 about $40 billion in deals were struck that were intended to jump-start growth.An email sent to clients of independent research firm Hedgeye Risk Management last year called Kinder Morgan and its associated companies ""a house of cards.""Barclays and Citi acted as financial advisors to KMI, Barclays is providing committed financing for the transaction, and Weil Gotshal & Manges and Bracewell & Giuliani acted as legal counsel to KMI, according to the statement.Jefferies acted as financial advisor to KMP and KMR and Baker Botts acted as legal counsel to KMP and KMR.

18,"   By Kevin Drawbaugh | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The U.S. Treasury Department is looking into increased use by companies of the master limited partnership (MLP) as a business structure, a department spokesperson said on Monday, hours after a pioneering user turned its back on the MLP.Houston-based Kinder Morgan Inc (KMI.N), the biggest U.S. pipeline company, said it will consolidate into a single corporation, folding together its existing organization of several master limited partnerships (MLPs).The Treasury statement, sent in an email, came in answer to questions from Reuters following Kinder Morgan's news.""We at Treasury are looking into the effects of these transactions on future tax revenues,"" the spokesperson said. ""Instances where the tax base may be eroded serve as a reminder of why we need Congress to enact business tax reform that broadens the tax base and lowers tax rates.""Kinder Morgan's investors had grown concerned that the tax-advantaged MLP structure popularized by the company was hurting its growth and was too complicated.Under the terms of its restructuring, it will consolidate its MLPs Kinder Morgan Energy Partners KMP.N and El Paso Pipeline Partners LP EPB.N with Kinder Morgan Management LLC KMR.N and organize into a single C-corporation. The move represented a turning point for the rise of MLPs, which are publicly traded but pay no corporate income tax, unlike C-corporations which are more familiar to investors.MLP status has been limited by the Internal Revenue Service to certain kinds of businesses, including oil and gas companies and real estate investment trusts. But a range of other businesses in recent years have tried to use the MLP structure. The IRS, which answers to the Treasury Department, said in early April that it had temporarily stopped issuing private letter rulings (PLRs) that companies often seek to get the agency's blessing when setting up new MLPs. IRS Commissioner John Koskinen told reporters that the agency had imposed a ""pause"" on the rulings so it could review the qualifications for MLPs. An IRS spokesman said on Monday that the pause remains in place.

22,"  Top U.S. pipeline company Kinder Morgan Inc said on Sunday it will put all its publicly traded units under one roof  in a $70 billion deal, responding to investor concerns about its growth prospects and complicated financial structure.The oil and gas pipeline company said it would shed the tax-advantaged legal structure it had popularized during the U.S. shale boom, the Master Limited Partnership (MLP), and fold its units into one company with a market capitalization of $92 billion organized as a C-corporation.The affected units include Kinder Morgan Energy Partners LP, Kinder Morgan Management, and El Paso Pipeline Partners. The deal is comprised of $40 billion in Kinder Morgan Inc equity, $4 billion in cash and $27 billion in assumed debt. Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Rich Kinder had been under pressure from investors and last month on Kinder Morgan Partners' second-quarter earnings call said combinations of the Kinder companies were being evaluated.A source familiar with the matter said Kinder Morgan's overall valuation had suffered because it traded as four entities and the market struggled to understand it.The MLP structure also required the units to hand over some 40 percent of their cash to general partners, hurting Kinder Morgan's ability to make acquisitions that will now be easier to carry out, the source added.At one point, people involved in the transaction considered putting all the units into a single MLP, the source said.But MLPs, which pay no taxes if they distribute the bulk of their earnings to investors, have been coming under greater scrutiny.The Internal Revenue Service this year halted approvals for new MLPs that stray from the traditional pipeline model, some investors have said the weak corporate governance standards of MLPs expose minority investors to added risks, and others have warned their allure among yield-hungry investors could diminish if U.S. interest rates rise.     TAX SAVINGS The company said in a presentation on its website that the new structure would allow for better dividend growth of about 10 percent a year and bigger income tax savings. It expects the deal to close by the end of the year.It forecast a dividend of $2.00 in 2015, a 16 percent increase over the anticipated 2014 dividend of $1.72. ""This combined entity will be the largest energy infrastructure company in North America and the third largest energy company overall,"" CEO Kinder said in a statement.Kinder, a former Enron Corp executive, formed Kinder Morgan in 1997, growing the company from one with 175 employees to one that now has about 11,000 employees.Worth an estimated $10 billion, according to Forbes, he has pledged much of his fortune to charity.Kinder Morgan is credited with pioneering the use of MLPs that more than 100 capital-intensive companies in the energy sector have adopted, and the company's deal marks a significant pullback from the structure. Kinder Morgan, the largest midstream company in North America, has an interest in or operates some 80,000 miles of pipelines that move natural gas, refined products, carbon dioxide and crude oil.In a July note to clients, analysts at Houston-based investment bank Tudor, Pickering Holt said the Kinder companies had underperformed for the last two years, held back by a ""stubbornly high cost of capital"" even though since 2012 about $40 billion in deals were struck that were intended to jump-start growth.An email sent to clients of independent research firm Hedgeye Risk Management last year called Kinder Morgan and its associated companies ""a house of cards,"" though other analysts disagreed and said the company had strong fundamentals as U.S. output of oil and gas, and demand for infrastructure to move it, surges.Barclays and Citi acted as financial advisors to KMI, Barclays is providing committed financing for the transaction, and Weil Gotshal & Manges and Bracewell & Giuliani acted as legal counsel to KMI, according to the statement. Jefferies acted as financial advisor to KMP and KMR and Baker Botts acted as legal counsel to KMP and KMR.

25,"  HOUSTON Nearly everyone on Wall Street seems to like Kinder Morgan Inc's (KMI.N) $44 billion deal to scrap its master limited partnership (MLP) structure, except Kevin Kaiser.Kaiser, a 27-year-old Ivy League-educated analyst at independent research firm Hedgeye Risk Management, first took aim at the pipeline company in September. At the time, he recommended shorting Kinder Morgan Energy Partners in a report that claimed the company skimped on maintenance work to boost cash distributed to investors in its MLPs, an assertation the company disputed.Now, in a new report obtained by Reuters, Kaiser is recommending investors short Kinder Morgan Inc, which will be the remaining entity after it buys out its two MLPs El Paso Pipeline Partners LP EPB.N and Kinder Morgan Energy Partners LP KMP.N and Kinder Morgan Management LLC KMR.N for cash and stock. He argues the combined company will be overvalued and have too much debt. Kinder Morgan Inc's shares traded on Tuesday at $38.50.""With (pro forma) Kinder Morgan prices at a valuation comparable to Facebook's FB.N, the risk from here is to the downside,"" Kaiser wrote. ""The valuation risk is substantial and is exacerbated by the higher leverage. But anyone who was short Kinder Morgan Energy Partners would have had a very bad day on Monday when units rose 17 percent to close at $94.12. One MLP investor characterized short sellers as the biggest losers in the deal.""Nothing happened yesterday,"" Kaiser said in an interview. There was no value created. All they did was move around some deck chairs."" Kaiser, who is an active social media user, took a beating on Twitter on Monday and was even singled out by CNBC financial personality Jim Cramer in a column on the Street.com.    Still, analysts at Moody's plan to give the combined company an investment grade rating characterized as ""weak"" due to a high debt level and planned high dividend payout ratio. Moody's calculates that Kinder Morgan as a consolidated company will have a net debt-to-earnings ratio of 6 times before EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization), leaving it ""more leveraged than all of its peers,"" the rating agency said in a note on Monday.    Kinder Morgan declined to specifically comment on Kaiser's assertions. But on a conference call with analysts on Monday, Chief Executive Officer Rich Kinder said the deal would add ""immediate and significant value uplift"" to its investors.Kinder also said its debt to EBITDA ratio would move lower over time.

27,"  NEW YORK Aug 13 Buyout firm Carlyle Group LP  has hired banks for an initial public offering of Axalta Coating Systems LLC, according to people familiar with the matter, just a year and a half after it acquired the company from Dupont for $4.9 billion.Citigroup Inc and Goldman Sachs Group Inc have been given leading roles in the potential IPO of the performance coatings company, the people said on Wednesday. The IPO could raise as much as $1 billion, one of the people added.The sources asked not to be identified because the discussions are private. Bloomberg News reported on Axalta's IPO preparations earlier on Wednesday. Carlyle, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs declined to comment, while an Axalta spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Based in Philadelphia, Axalta makes liquid and powder coatings for the automotive and general transportation industries. It operates 35 manufacturing centers and does business in more than 130 countries, according to its website.Private equity firms typically hold on to companies between three and five years before they sell them. Carlyle's plans to take Axalta public in such a short time frame reflect the strength of the equity markets as well the private equity firm's confidence in Axalta's prospects as a public company. These plans, however, may not necessarily lead to a quick exit for Carlyle. For example, it took the Washington, D.C.-based firm more than six years for it to sell its shares in Hertz Global Holdings Inc. Carlyle took Hertz public in November 2006, just seven months after it acquired the company together with Clayton Dubilier & Rice LLC and Merrill Lynch Private Equity in a $15 billion deal.Other private equity firms have also rushed to take some of their biggest portfolio companies public. Apollo Global Management LLC floated oil and gas producer EP Energy Corp in the stock market in January, just eight months after acquiring it from Kinder Morgan Inc for $7.15 billion.

28,"   By Rory Carroll and Jennifer Chaussee | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO A San Francisco Superior Court judge on Friday dismissed a lawsuit brought by environmental groups against Kinder Morgan’s Richmond, California, rail terminal, which quietly began unloading crude oil from trains this year, saying the plaintiffs waited too long to file their complaint. The groups argued that since the company was given permission from regulators to begin accepting the deliveries without public notice, they were not immediately aware of the change. Judge Peter Busch acknowledged there were “deep concerns” about the new cargo, which passes through the densely populated city of Richmond, but said the plaintiffs missed the 180-day window to request that the permit be revoked. Suma Peesapati, an attorney for the environmental groups that brought the suit, said the company and regulators knowingly deceived the public. “This is just how the agencies and industry win – hide the information, make the change under the cover of night, and hope people don’t notice while the clock winds down on any hope to stop these dangerous and callous developments,” she said. Kinder Morgan and the regulator, the Bay Area Air Quality Management District, said they followed the law as written and denied doing anything in secret. California law does not require public notification or an environmental review for the permit, which was issued in February.  Friday’s ruling was met with hisses from environmentalists who attended the hearing, some of whom participated in a protest the previous day where they chained themselves to a fence at the facility. The Kinder Morgan terminal is the most substantial oil-by-rail facility in the state, handling up to 72,000 barrels per day. The crude is unloaded from incoming trains and placed on trucks bound for a Tesoro-owned refinery in Martinez.  The number of trains ferrying crude oil by rail to California from Canada and North Dakota's Bakken shale formation has jumped dramatically in recent years, prompting safety and environmental concerns. In July 2013, a train carrying crude oil derailed and exploded in a town in the Canadian province of Quebec, killing 47 people.

30,"  VANCOUVER, Sept 17 The Supreme Court of British Columbia has rejected a local municipality's bid for a temporary injunction to stop survey work for an oil pipeline expansion project proposed by Kinder Morgan Energy Partners.Justice Brenda Brown issued her decision on Wednesday, but her written reasons will not be released until next week.Burnaby mayor Derek Corrigan said he was ""disappointed and frustrated"" by the court's decision but said the municipality will continue to push for a permanent injunction.""We are considering whether or not we want to appeal the interim injunction denial,"" he said. ""We won't know that until we see the reasons sometime next week.""The court case is the latest in a long-running battle between the City of Burnaby, part of Metro Vancouver, and Kinder Morgan over the Texas-based company's plans to nearly triple the capacity of its Trans Mountain crude pipeline to 890,000 barrels per day. The company wants to twin the pipeline, which was built in 1953 and runs from the oil sand hub of Edmonton to its marine terminal in Burnaby. But the city, which has grown into a major urban center over the last 60 years, is opposed to the plan.While much of the new line would run along the existing right-of-way, the company has changed its preferred route through Burnaby and now wants to run a key segment under Burnaby Mountain, a local conservation site. City officials and crews hired by Kinder Morgan clashed last week over whether the company was allowed to cut down a handful of trees on the mountain to do survey work for the new route.The company said it had been granted permission to carry out the work by Canada's energy regulator, the National Energy Board (NEB), while the city argued it was against municipal law and blocked access to the site. Burnaby then asked the court for an injunction to block any work that would disrupt parkland. The pipeline company responded by asking the NEB to prevent the city from stopping its crews.The Trans Mountain expansion is supported by Canada's oil producers, who are eager to sidestep the over-supplied U.S. Midwest, where Canadian crudes sell at a discount to benchmark prices, and tap directly into foreign markets.But the project is facing growing opposition from communities throughout Metro Vancouver, who worry about the risks that come with more oil being stored in tanks in Burnaby and more tanker ship traffic on Pacific Coast waters.Kinder Morgan has said it needs access to the mountain to complete environmental and geotechnical studies that it must submit to the NEB before a Dec. 1 deadline. The regulator has already pushed back its decision on the project by about six months to January 2016.

31,"   By Kristen Hays and Terry Wade | HOUSTON  HOUSTON To capitalize on a flood of domestic and Canadian crude into the U.S. Gulf Coast, logistics giant Kinder Morgan Energy Partners is spending more than $1.5 billion in Houston to build the most flexible oil and fuel transport hub in the country.The company's expanding infrastructure smorgasbord includes a bit of almost everything at the increasingly crowded Houston Ship Channel –  all next door to the biggest concentration of refiners in the country.The buildout, executives say, responds to the increasingly dynamic world of physical crude trading in North America, where the variety of available crudes is growing, and is aimed at securing their central position in moving oil from the U.S. shale boom to market.

Following a hearing earlier this month, the board agreed it could trump local by-laws and ordered the city to stand down. ""Surveys and studies about Trans Mountain's proposed pipeline route through Burnaby Mountain are required in order to make a recommendation to the federal government about whether or not this project should proceed,"" the board said in a release.

40,"  VANCOUVER Nov 21 Kinder Morgan Energy Partners  said on Friday that crews have resumed survey work related to its Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project in the Vancouver suburb of Burnaby, even as Canadian police arrested more protesters at two work sites.Kinder Morgan said it was able to move its equipment onto Burnaby Mountain overnight and that crews would be working 24 hours a day for the next 10 to 12 days to complete drilling work required by regulators.The company, which hopes to nearly triple the capacity of the existing 300,000 barrel-per-day pipeline, plans to bore two holes deep into the mountain to test if it can run the expanded line under the conservation site, which is a popular hiking and picnic area for locals.Environmentalists, aboriginal groups and many area residents are opposed to the expansion, which would allow the company to ship more tar sands crude from Alberta to a port in Vancouver and on to Asian markets. A group of protesters, who call themselves the caretakers of the mountain, had for weeks been occupying the more remote of the two work sites. On Thursday, Canadian police began enforcing a court order for their removal, arresting 26 people. On Friday, eight more people were arrested, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) said in a statement, while three aboriginal protesters remain inside the injunction zone. Police are in talks to move them to a legal protest area nearby.Kinder Morgan, meanwhile, said it was setting up fencing and lights in preparation for starting drilling work. The company's proposal to expand the 60-year-old Trans Mountain pipeline is being reviewed by Canadian regulators, with a decision expected in early 2016.(Reporting by Julie Gordon; Editing by Richard Chang)",2014-11-22,KMI,"Fri Nov 21, 2014 | 7:41pm EST",Kinder Morgan resumes work on Canadian pipeline expansion,http://www.reuters.com//article/kinder-morgn-eng-pipeline-arrests-idUSL2N0TB31020141122?type=companyNews

43,"  HOUSTON Kinder Morgan Inc might export condensate as part of a resurrected plan to move Texas crude to Southern California via a converted natural gas pipeline, energy intelligence firm Genscape Inc reported in a blog post on Thursday.The pipeline and storage company is in talks with potential shippers for its Freedom Pipeline project, Genscape said, citing Tom Dobson, project director of Kinder Morgan Pipelines.It would be the first major crude pipeline from Texas into California, giving the Golden State access to cheaper inland crudes and cut dependence on more costly imports. ""We have always said that we will continue to look at this project and will build it if we get sufficient customer interest,"" Kinder spokesman Richard Wheatley said in an email on Thursday. ""This was discussion only, not a formal project announcement.""The company shelved the $2 billion project in mid-2013 because of lack of interest, but revived it with an added proposal to export processed condensate from third-party California docks, Dobson told Genscape at an energy conference in Los Angeles on Wednesday.   The line, as discussed, would move 100,000 bpd of condensate and 200,000 bpd of blended crude from far West Texas to Emido, California, near Los Angeles-area refineries, Dobson said.At least three companies - not including Kinder Morgan - are known to have received U.S. government approvals since September 2013 to export condensate, a very light form of crude. The rulings said condensate processed enough to qualify as a refined product could be exported without violating the decades-old U.S. crude export ban.Light processing provided by stabilizers, which removes natural gas liquids, and other more sophisticated distillation units meet that threshold. A fourth company, BHP Billiton Ltd, said it is moving forward with condensate exports without waiting for a ruling because the company is confident its minimal processing is satisfactory.Wheatley had no immediate comment on whether Kinder Morgan is seeking a ruling. Kinder Morgan's plan, if approved, would include a new 150,000 bpd atmospheric topping unit that could produce processed condensate, as well as gasoil and residual fuel to blend with crude, Dobson said.Export-bound condensate could then be shipped in batches separate from other crude blended to satisfy the requirements of California refineries built to run heavier oil, Dobson said.

45,"  (Corrects Kinder Morgan instrument code in paragraph 24)By Edward McAllister and David RandallNEW YORK Jan 12 With nearly a quarter of U.S. energy shares' value wiped out by oil's six-month slide, investors are wondering if the sector has taken enough punishment and whether it is time to pile back in ahead of earnings reports later this month.The broad energy S&P 1500 index gained more than 4 percent over the past month, suggesting many believe markets have already factored in the pain caused by oil prices tumbling by more than half since June below $50 a barrel.Yet since the start of this year, most energy stocks have given up some of those gains, revealing anxiety that some nasty surprises might still be lurking somewhere and that last month's bounce may not last.A closer look at valuations and interviews with a dozen of smaller firms ahead of fourth quarter results from their bigger, listed rivals, shows there are reasons to be nervous.What small firms say is that the oil rout hit home faster and harder than most had expected.""Things have changed a lot quicker than I thought they would,"" says Greg Doramus, sales manager at Orion Drilling in Corpus Christi, Texas, a small firm which leases 16 drilling rigs. He talks about falling rates, last-minute order cancellations and customers breaking leases.The conventional wisdom is that hedging and long-term contracts would ensure that most energy firms would only start feeling the full force of the downdraft this year.The view from the oil fields from Texas to North Dakota is that the pain is already spreading.""We have been cut from the work,"" says Adam Marriott, president of Fandango Logistics, a small oil trucking firm in Salt Lake City. He says shipments have fallen by half since June when oil was fetching more than $100 a barrel and his company had all the business it could handle.Bigger firms are also feeling the sting.Last week, a leading U.S. drilling contractor Helmerich & Payne reported that leasing rates for its high-tech rigs plunged 10 percent from the previous quarter, sending its shares 5 percent lower. DOWNGRADES AND RALLIES The apparent disconnect between energy stocks' recent recovery and the furious cuts in Wall Street's earning estimates could also be a sign that the sector's 24 percent plunge since June may not fully reflect how ugly it can still get.Thomson Reuters data shows Wall Street brokerages slashed their fourth quarter estimates for energy firms by over 7 percent in the past 30 days. They now predict earnings of S&P 500 energy firms to fall 20.7 percent in the fourth quarter and by 36.1 percent this quarter.The price-to-earnings ratio based on estimates for the next  12 months for S&P 500 energy stocks is around 17, more than 16.3 for the whole S&P 500 index and above the sector's 12.5 figure based on reported results, according to Thomson Reuters data. This suggests that either investors bet on a rebound in oil analysts do not see or they risk getting disappointed when the results come out.Yet several stocks have rallied in the past month. One striking example is Penn Virginia Corp, an exploration and production company, which soared by nearly 30 percent even as analysts cut their estimates by more than a third. Short interest of nearly 30 percent suggests the rally might be in part fueled by a ""short squeeze"" when sellers are forced to buy back the stock when it starts rising to cut their losses.Some analysts say though, many stocks have been sold off enough to offer good value.""If you have no exposure this is a good time to step in,"" Scott Wren, senior equity strategist at Wells Fargo Advisors said at the start of this year.Analysts who advocate buying energy stocks recommend big, high-dividend paying companies, such as Exxon Mobil or Chevron. Both stocks have outperformed the sector during the six-month rout in which companies, such as Chesapeake Energy  or Halliburton lost a third or more of their value.Smaller firms are considered more risky, among them oilfield service companies exposed to spending cuts by exploration and production companies. Analysts expect this year's budgets to fall by a quarter, but many firms have yet to finalize plans. RISKS AND SAFE BETS Investors got a taste how bets on ""the worst might be over"" scenario could go bad last month when Civeo Corp, a provider of temporary housing for the oil industry, issued a profit warning.The stock has struggled since oil headed south, but investors were still shocked how hard the company got hit, sending its shares crashing by more than 50 percent in one day.For sure, not all energy firms are equal.Civeo represents scores of companies whose fortunes are tied to the shale oil boom that made the United States the world's top producer, but also helped create a global supply glut that sent prices tumbling.In such a market, the safest bets are pipeline companies like Kinder Morgan Inc, whose shares have risen more than 16 percent in the last six months. Their business depends on traffic volumes, much like toll roads, and the U.S. government still forecasts production to rise this year.Independent refiners and integrated oil majors such as Exxon Mobil that combine exploration with production, refining and distribution, are also expected to brave the storm fairly well.Industry experts say larger, efficient and financially sound producers and services firms may also emerge as winners: taking over weaker rivals or gaining market share.""Good companies with bad balance sheets with productive properties, those are going to be targets,"" said Mark Chesen, a managing director of SSW Capital Advisors, a Pennsylvania-based investment bank that specializes in distressed mid-cap firms.But while hedge funds, buy-out firm, private equity and distressed debt investors gear up for 2015 as a year of energy deals, Chesen said they were likely to wait first for signs of oil prices stabilizing.""Until bottoming out I don't think institutional hedge funds will be interested,"" he said.

54,"   By Kevin Allison | CHICAGO  CHICAGO (Reuters Breakingviews) - Leave it to Harold Hamm to pump Kinder Morgan for a tidy gain. The Continental Resources boss is selling Hiland Partners, his private pipeline company, to its giant rival for $3 billion, more than enough to cover his nearly $1 billion divorce bill. The sale also eliminates a conflict of interest that arose from a 2013 deal between Hiland and Continental. Kinder Morgan, meanwhile, gets a prized - if pricey - foothold in North Dakota's Bakken shale.The transaction comes a little more than two months after a court slapped the oil magnate with one of the biggest divorce tabs in U.S. history. Hamm cut a check for most of the amount earlier this month. He recently took out a personal loan, though, backed by about a quarter of his roughly $10.4 billion stake in Continental.Selling Hiland also probably seals the end of a nettlesome spat with a group of minority Continental shareholders. They sued Hamm in 2013 after Continental invested $100 million in a Hiland pipeline project, alleging that the billionaire had benefited himself at other shareholders' expense. Continental maintained that the investment was proper, and an Oklahoma court dismissed the suit last August.Kinder Morgan, meanwhile, looks to be paying a healthy price to include in its sprawling web of oil connections one of North America's most valuable shale regions. The $89 billion pipeline operator disclosed few financial details of the acquisition, saying only that the $3 billion tab should amount to about 10 times Hiland's expected 2018 EBITDA. That's less than the nearly 17 times forward enterprise multiple on which Kinder currently trades. But the absence of any pre-2018 estimates suggests the company is shelling out a chunky multiple of next year's expected cash flow for the business, and it's an especially tumultuous time for energy markets.The comparatively steady nature of the oil pipeline industry means the acquisition should pay off eventually. That said, there's not much doubt that Hamm has netted himself a pretty sweet deal. CONTEXT NEWS  - Pipeline operator Kinder Morgan on Jan. 21 announced that it had agreed to pay $3 billion, including debt, for Hiland Partners, a privately held company controlled by Continental Resources Chief Executive Harold Hamm.- A group of Continental's minority shareholders sued Hamm in 2013 after Continental invested nearly $100 million in a pipeline being built by Hiland. The shareholders alleged that the investment benefited Hamm at other stockholders' expense. Continental said the lawsuit had no merit.- Hamm in November was ordered to pay $995 million to his ex-wife in one of the biggest divorce judgments in U.S. history. Continental said in a regulatory filing on Jan. 13 that Hamm had pledged about one-quarter of his shares in the company - currently worth about $2.8 billion - as collateral for a personal loan.- Kinder Morgan announcement: bit.ly/1JlyO2C   (The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist.

60,"   By Kristen Hays | HOUSTON  HOUSTON Kinder Morgan Inc's (KMI.N) proposed Freedom Pipeline, which would move West Texas crude oil to Southern California, is ""getting more interest"" from U.S. West Coast refiners, the head of the company's natural gas pipeline unit told analysts on Wednesday.Unit President Tom Martin said the company ""may have a shot"" at moving ahead with converting a natural gas pipeline to move crude and condensate to California ""if we can get the refiners on board.""The pipeline and logistics company first proposed the $2 billion project in 2012 but shelved it in May 2013 for lack of shipper interest. Martin said on Wednesday that the revamped proposal included adding a facility at the front end in Texas to provide crude blends that better match the Alaska North Slope (ANS) crude that California refineries typically process.The new proposal also involves shipping ultra-light crude, known as condensate, that could be exported from California, he said during the company's annual analyst meeting. Martin did not say whether Kinder Morgan has or is awaiting U.S. government approval to export condensate with enough processing to qualify as an exportable refined product.At least four other companies have received such approvals, and a fifth is moving ahead with exports without a ruling, satisfied that its minimal processing is sufficient. If approved, the Freedom Pipeline project would open another outlet for processed condensate exports that so far have been shipped from the U.S. Gulf Coast.In 2013, Kinder Morgan said the project could be revived if shipper interest warranted. Martin said the original proposal to convert the 740-mile (1,190-km) line to move crude and build more than 200 miles (320 km) of new pipe would have moved West Texas oil that did not match the types that West Coast refiners want. The new proposal includes a topping unit in Wink, Texas, that would produce processed condensate as well as gasoils and residual fuels to create ANS-like crude blends. ""It seems to be getting more interest from the refiners in the West,"" Martin said.

62,"  HOUSTON Kinder Morgan Inc is commissioning the first of two condensate splitters at its Houston Ship Channel complex after months of delays, the company said on Tuesday.""We are currently commissioning as planned on our splitter and expect to be at capacity later this month,"" Kinder spokeswoman Melissa Ruiz said.The first of two 50,000 barrels per day (bpd) splitters was originally targeted to start up last summer, but a manufacturer's delay in delivering a major component pushed commissioning to late 2014. But then bad weather and more vendor delays further set back startup until this month.The second 50,000 bpd splitter remains on target to start up in July. A splitter is a step up from oilfield stabilizers, which remove natural gas liquids from crude and condensate, and oil refineries. It ""splits"" condensate, a very light form of crude oil, into various components such as jet fuel, diesel and naphtha, a building block for gasoline.BP Plc has a 10-year deal with Kinder Morgan to buy all the output from both splitters to sell domestically or internationally. BP has also exported at least one cargo of lightly processed condensate from the Eagle Ford shale in Texas that had not been run through a splitter from the Houston Ship Channel.U.S. government regulators have given approvals to several companies to export stabilized condensate, saying it qualifies as an exportable refined product. Previously the industry believed condensate needed more sophisticated processing in a splitter or a refinery before the output could be exported without violating the decades-old U.S. crude export ban.

63,"  (Adds quotes from Keyera CEO)By Nia WilliamsCALGARY, Alberta, March 31 Canada's Keyera Corp  and midstream company Kinder Morgan Inc plan to build 4.8 million barrels of new crude oil storage in the marketing hub of Edmonton, Alberta, the two companies said on Tuesday.Capacity at the new terminal has potential to increase to 6.6 million barrels, depending on future demand.The terminal will be a 50-50 joint venture with Keyera's share of costs expected to be C$330 million ($260.36 million), while Kinder Morgan will potentially spend C$342 million on construction of tanks and a further C$69 million on connecting pipelines and infrastructure.In total, the two companies will build 12 crude storage tanks on land owned by Keyera. Commissioning on the first tanks is expected to start in the second half of 2017. ""Clearly there has been a growth in demand for crude storage as volumes continue to grow in Western Canada and land is becoming pretty tight in Edmonton,"" said David Smith, Keyera's chief executive officer. ""We had 80 acres of unused land and determined storage there would be a very attractive location.""Edmonton, one of Western Canada's major crude storage and marketing hubs, is a gathering point for oil sands production before it is shipped via pipeline or rail to markets in eastern Canada and the United States.Output from the oil sands is forecast to grow to 6.4 million barrels per day by 2030, up from 3.5 million bpd in 2014, according to the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers. Last week energy intelligence firm Genscape reported inventories in Edmonton hit roughly 64 percent of capacity.Smith said there is 7.2 million barrels of merchant storage available for leasing to customers in Edmonton, and 8.3 million barrels of regulated storage owned by pipeline companies Kinder Morgan and Enbridge Inc. The 4.8 million barrels of new storage is underpinned by a number of long-term take-or-pay contracts.It will be connected to Kinder Morgan's existing Edmonton storage terminals, the Trans Mountain pipeline to Canada's Pacific Coast and two Edmonton crude-by-rail terminals.Kinder Morgan will oversee construction and operate the new terminal once it is in service.""When this initial project is completed, we will have grown our merchant storage, exclusive of our Trans Mountain regulated storage assets, from basically zero tankage to a 12-million-barrel position in roughly a 10-year period,"" said Kinder Morgan Terminals President John Schlosser.($1 = 1.2675 Canadian dollars)   (Editing by David Gregorio and Lisa Shumaker)",2015-03-31,KMI,"Tue Mar 31, 2015 | 7:18pm EDT","UPDATE 1-Keyera, Kinder Morgan to build 4.8 mln bbls of Alberta crude storage",http://www.reuters.com//article/crude-storage-edmonton-idUSL2N0WX2XT20150331?type=companyNews

65,"   By Tom Hals  A Delaware judge found an affiliate of El Paso Corp liable for $171 million for overpaying in a pipeline deal, a ruling that could bolster the legal power of investors in an increasingly popular investment vehicle used in the energy sector.The judgment is one of the largest from the Delaware Court of Chancery, which is among the country's busiest venues for investor lawsuits. The opinion blasted directors and advisors for showing indifference to the investors in a master limited partnership (MLP) controlled by El Paso. Energy companies have used MLPs to hold assets with steady cash flows, like pipelines. The structures are popular with investors because they deliver higher dividends but have also been far more insulated from investor lawsuits than a corporation. ""You might have thought they were impregnable,"" said Larry Hamermesh of the Widener University School of Law in Wilmington.For that reason, the ruling and any possible appeal will be closely watched to see if investors in publicly traded MLPs gain more protections akin to shareholders in corporations.The lawsuit centered on the sale of two natural gas-related subsidiaries of El Paso to El Paso Pipeline Partners, an MLP controlled by the parent company.  The 2011 lawsuit was brought by a holder of common units of the MLP. The unitholder alleged the MLP overpaid for the subsidiaries for the benefit of the parent company.Judge Travis Laster found the directors for the MLP caved to parent company demands and approved a deal they had criticized in private.""Their actions evidenced conscious indifference to their responsibilities to El Paso MLP,"" Laster wrote in Monday's opinion.  El Paso and the MLP were acquired by Kinder Morgan Inc after the deals at the center of the lawsuit were completed. Kinder Morgan said it was disappointed by the ruling and it continued to believe the deals were in the best interest of the MLP.It said it was considering an appeal once outstanding issues in the cases were resolved.Attorneys for the general partner, which controlled the MLP, and the general partner's directors did not respond to a request for comment. Nor did attorneys for the plaintiff. The directors had argued the deal was fair because it would increase the distributions to holders of common units. Laster also criticized the work of the investment bank, Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co, which advised the three-member committee of the general partner that controlled the MLP.""Instead of helping the committee develop alternatives, identify arguments, and negotiate with the controller, Tudor sought to make the price that parent proposed look fair,"" Laster wrote. Tudor, which was not a defendant, did not respond to a request for a comment. The El Paso case was what is known as a derivative lawsuit, meaning any judgment is generally for the benefit of the company, not investors.

68,"   By Kristen Hays | HOUSTON  HOUSTON The state of Georgia's top transportation official has denied Kinder Morgan Inc's request for a key permit to build a $1.12 billion gasoline and distillate pipeline through the southeast part of the state.In a letter dated Monday, Georgia's Department of Transportation Commissioner Russell McMurray said he had determined that Kinder's proposed 360-mile (579 km) Palmetto Pipeline is not critical enough to allow the company to condemn property and obtain easements along its route to allow its construction.""There is substantial evidence that the construction of the proposed pipeline will not constitute a public convenience and necessity,"" McMurray said in the letter addressed to an attorney representing Kinder in the matter, a copy of which was received by Reuters.Kinder Morgan was ""evaluating all options to move forward with the project,"" Ron McClain, the company's head of products pipelines, said in a statement on Tuesday.The company did not elaborate on those options, but Georgia DOT spokeswoman Natalie Dale said on Tuesday that Kinder can appeal, ""likely to a court."" The 167,000 barrels per day (bpd) Palmetto Pipeline would run from Belton, South Carolina, to Jacksonville, Florida.The project would also involve more storage tanks and pump stations to add 125,000 bpd of capacity on part of Kinder's 3,100-mile-long, 700,000 bpd Louisiana-to-Virginia Plantation Pipeline system. That new capacity would stretch from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, to the Palmetto connection in South Carolina.

McMurray said multiple petroleum suppliers compete in those markets and there is no evidence Palmetto would affect prices.Kinder's McClain said on Tuesday that the project was ""vehemently opposed"" by some suppliers seeking to maintain ""artificially higher prices.""Kinder also had argued that the project would satisfy growing fuel demand in the Georgia region, but McMurray countered that demand has retreated since a 2006 high and is not expected to reach those levels through 2020.

71,"  HOUSTON, June 25 Kinder Morgan Inc aims to start up its second condensate splitter at its Houston Ship Channel complex next month, a spokeswoman said.The 50,000 barrels per day splitter is slated to begin commissioning next week to test all systems leading to startup, the spokeswoman said.Kinder Morgan started up the first of two 50,000 bpd splitters in late March after delays in delivery of manufacturer parts and weather issues pushed startup from mid-2014.Due to the boom in output of condensate in the U.S. shale plays, the oil industry is investing up to $2.4 billion in condensate splitters to ""split"" the very light form of crude into components like jet fuel, diesel and naphtha, a building block for gasoline, to sell domestically or export. It is more sophisticated than an oilfield stabilizer, which removes natural gas liquids from condensate, but does not make finished motor fuels like a refinery.BP Plc has a 10-year deal to buy all the output from both splitters. Magellan Midstream Partners has a similar deal with Trafigura for a 50,000 bpd splitter under construction in Corpus Christi, Texas.U.S. regulators say stabilized condensate qualifies as an exportable refined product, so companies can export it without having to run it through a splitter first. Some planned splitter projects have been altered or put on hold as companies gauge whether to move forward or build cheaper stabilizers.(Reporting by Kristen Hays; Editing by Marguerita Choy)",2015-06-25,KMI,"Thu Jun 25, 2015 | 12:31pm EDT",Kinder Morgan to start up second Texas condensate splitter in July,http://www.reuters.com//article/kinder-morgan-de-condensate-splitter-idUSL1N0ZB1EO20150625?type=companyNews
72,"  (Adds comments details from Kinder Morgan executive, background)By Kristen HaysHOUSTON, July 15 Kinder Morgan Inc is considering more export opportunities from Texas and the U.S. Northeast, including liquid petroleum gas, refined products and potentially crude, a top executive told analysts on Wednesday.""The market is very ripe in Houston right now, it's just a matter of which product makes the most sense,"" John Schlosser, head of Kinder Morgan's terminals division, said during a quarterly earnings call.Kinder Morgan already exports refined products and has increased its docks to 12 from four at its Houston Ship Channel complex. Those expansions accommodate nearby refiners seeking to increase exports. U.S. petroleum product exports rose 500,000 barrels per day to an average of 4.1 million bpd in the first four months of 2015 compared with the same span last year, and 40 percent of the increase was gasoline, diesel and jet fuel, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.Schlosser indicated Kinder Morgan is more interested in  refined product export capacity than that for LPGs or crude, though all are under consideration.LPG projects are ""very profitable"" and could compete with potential crude projects and other expansions, ""but we see more opportunities on the clean side, more so than the other two,"" he said. A decades-old ban prohibits domestic crude exports, but U.S. regulators allow exports of a very light form of crude known as condensate if minimally processed. Condensate makes up about half of Eagle Ford shale output in Texas, and is increasingly produced in other U.S. shale oilfields.Kinder Morgan operates a 300,000 bpd pipeline that moves Eagle Ford crude and condensate to Houston. That line also is connected to the Kinder/Magellan Midstream Partners  joint-venture Double Eagle pipeline that moves Eagle Ford condensate to Corpus Christi, Texas. Kinder Morgan this month started up the second of two 50,000 bpd condensate splitters that split the very light crude into other components like naphtha, a building block for gasoline, and distillates. BP Plc has a 10-year agreement to buy all the output from both units.Companies can export condensate with less sophisticated processing in smaller, cheaper stabilizers, which remove natural gas liquids, but don't make motor fuels.(Reporting by Kristen Hays; Editing by Chris Reese and Leslie Adler)",2015-07-15,KMI,"Wed Jul 15, 2015 | 6:41pm EDT","UPDATE 1-Kinder Morgan considering LPG, product and potential crude exports",http://www.reuters.com//article/kinder-morgan-de-exports-idUSL2N0ZV34P20150715?type=companyNews

Kinder Morgan operates a petroleum coke terminal in Port Arthur.Total's Tricia Fuller said coker operations were at minimal rates and operators had stopped taking coke from the unit due to the death.The sources said production at the 225,500 barrel per day (bpd) refinery's other units had been reduced.""We will restart (the coker) once we know it can be operated safely,"" Fuller said. The coker was not damaged in the incident, the sources said.Investigators from the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) were expected to open an investigation Saturday, Fuller said.Generally, U.S. refineries do not need permission from safety or environmental regulators to resume production following a fatality. Bulldozers were being used to push coke and coarse sand-like coke dust from beneath the 60,000 bpd delayed coking unit because a crane, the owner of which was unknown on Saturday, that is usually used to remove coke from the pit had been shut for repairs for several months, the sources said.Kinder Morgan spokeswoman Sara Hughes said she had no further information about the accident beyond confirmation of the worker's death. ""An investigation is being conducted,"" Hughes said.Petroleum coke, which can be used as a coal substitute, is made from the gunky, black residual crude that remains after all refinable material has been obtained from it.In a delayed coking unit, residual crude is injected into giant drums where it is heated until it hardens, a process that usually takes 24-48 hours.The coke is knocked out of the drums by high pressure jets of scalding water and falls into the coke pit beneath.Total is currently seeking a partner to purchase a 50-percent stake in the Port Arthur Refinery.

Previously, it was scheduled to be released on Jan. 26, 2016. ""We have received the updated steps and process from the NEB. We are currently reviewing the timeline and whether there are any implications to our project,"" Kinder Morgan spokeswoman Ali Hounsell said.Kinder Morgan currently has construction scheduled to start in the third quarter of 2016 and anticipates the pipeline will be in service by the third quarter of 2018. The NEB has 15 months from the date it determines a project application is complete to issue a decision or recommendation, but is allowed to exclude periods of time from that 15-month limit, effectively pausing the review. After receiving a recommendation from the NEB, the federal government would have up to three months to make a final decision. This is the second time regulators have imposed an exclusion period on the Trans Mountain application.It comes as a result of a decision by the hearing panel on Aug. 21 to strike evidence in favour of the pipeline prepared by consultant Steven Kelly, who was recently appointed to the NEB.Regulators were concerned that including evidence from Kelly would lead to questions about the impartiality of the review process.

85,"  (Adds details on dividend, funding)Oct 21 Kinder Morgan Inc on Wednesday increased its quarterly dividend but said the payout would grow a bit slower next year as the U.S. pipeline company seeks to maintain financial flexibility in a slumping commodities market.The company said it expects to increase its dividend by 6-10 percent in 2016. For 2015, the dividend is on track to grow 15 percent from a year ago.Analysts on a conference call peppered Executive Chairman Rich Kinder with questions about the dividend. He emphasized the new guidance was just a range and said the company has only started to work on its budget for next year.Executives stressed they were trying to strike a balance between investing in their business, avoiding dilutive equity raisings, keeping investment grade credit ratings, and paying a healthy dividend. ""We are going to be flexible in the future with respect to the dividend,"" said CFO Kim Dang.The company said it was planning to use an ""alternative source"" of funding that would allow it to refrain from tapping equity markets until the middle of next year. It did not offer details, but analysts say private equity funds are increasingly trying to move into the energy space.It also said it is starting to see opportunities for acquisitions over the next 6-12 months, after a joint venture announced this week that included BP Plc's U.S. terminals. Third-quarter net income attributable to Kinder Morgan fell nearly 43.5 percent, hurt by softening demand for domestic steel and continued weakness in global coal prices.""While we are largely insulated from commodity price impacts due to our predominately take-or-pay supported cash flows, we are not totally immune,"" Kinder said. The Houston-based company raised its quarterly dividend to 51 cents per share from 44 cents, which will help the company meet its full-year dividend target of $2 per share.The higher quarterly dividend equated to an annual payout of $2.04 per share.Net income attributable to Kinder Morgan to $186 million in the three months ended Sept. 30 from $329 million a year earlier.Excluding items, earnings fell to $348 million from $537 million. Revenue fell 13.6 percent to $3.7 billion, mainly on weakness in its CO2 business.

91,"  (Adds Greenpeace comment, Trudeau quote from August)By Randall PalmerOTTAWA Nov 18 Canada's environmental review of existing applications for crude oil pipeline projects is continuing despite the new Liberal government's plans to make the assessment process more robust, Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr said on Wednesday.""They have not stopped. The process continues,"" he told reporters on a conference call.""There will be a transition as we amend the ways in which the National Energy Board goes about the process of evaluating these projects, and we will announce those changes as soon as we can, but the process continues.""The Liberal government's pledge to toughen up the environmental review process for oil pipelines had raised the question of whether existing applications would require resubmission. Key projects are TransCanada Corp's application for the Energy East pipeline to take oil from Alberta and Saskatchewan to the East Coast, and the expansion of Kinder Morgan Inc's Trans Mountain Pipeline to the Pacific.Specifically addressing the Kinder Morgan application, Carr said the review was going ahead.He appeared less clear when asked about Energy East: ""I understand that any changes that we make to the process will have an effect on projects. I know that it's important, and we will be reviewing the situation and we will give you the results as soon as we can."" The minister said the government was committed to a process that has the confidence of Canadians.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, while campaigning in October for election, had said it was up to communities to decide whether to support Energy East. ""It is not up to government to support one project or another, it is up for a government to set the framework within which communities can choose, or not, to support a project,"" he said at the time.Nonetheless, Carr reiterated on Wednesday the government's opposition to Enbridge Inc's Northern Gateway pipeline.Greenpeace climate and energy campaigner Keith Stewart, referring to Trans Mountain, said he did not see ""how the Trudeau government can continue with the review of a pipeline under rules that Trudeau has denounced for ignoring climate impacts, failing to respect indigenous rights, and lacking a grounding in sound science.""He pointed to video footage (goo.gl/eVBmxS) of Trudeau saying in August that the new environmental process would apply to the Kinder Morgan line. Trudeau said it would not be approved in January because there would be a new Liberal government ""and that process needs to be redone.""(Reporting by Randall Palmer; Editing by Paul Simao and Alan Crosby)",2015-11-18,KMI,"Wed Nov 18, 2015 | 2:36pm EST",UPDATE 2-Canada says pipeline reviews proceed despite change to process,http://www.reuters.com//article/canada-politics-pipelines-idUSL1N13D1JJ20151118?type=companyNews

96,"  (Adds details, quotes)HOUSTON Dec 8 Kinder Morgan Inc slashed its dividend 75 percent on Tuesday, marking the first time the U.S. pipeline giant has cut payouts to shareholders since it has been a publicly traded company.The move, which will reduce the annual dividend to 50 cents a share from about $2 a share, is an acknowledgement that the worst oil price crash in six years is hurting once-resilient pipeline companies.Kinder Morgan shares have shed about half their value since the company first warned on Oct. 21 that payouts would slow. In after hours trade on Tuesday the shares fell nearly 7 percent to $14.67.Moody's put the company on credit watch negative last week after it bought a stake in a leveraged natural gas pipeline system, and several analysts downgraded the stock. Founder Rich Kinder said the smaller payout to investors would allow Kinder Morgan to avoid issuing equity while maintaining its investment grade credit rating.""We evaluated numerous options, including significant asset sales, but ultimately concluded that these other options were uneconomic to our investors in the long run. This decision was not made lightly,"" he said in a statement. Analysts at Tudor Pickering Holt told clients in a note that  the cash would be better spent reinvesting or buying back shares.""We'd argue that while market clearly hates the possibility of a dividend cut, a full payout is the least effective use for that cash."" Once the darlings of investors, growth prospects of pipeline companies have been undercut by a 50 percent slide in oil prices and tough environmental reviews that have delayed projects.Pipeline companies have been especially popular with investors in recent years for their ability consistently to pay and grow large dividends.But their attractiveness has faded since at least the summer as executives at some of the biggest pipeline companies, including Plains All American LP, have warned of slower or variable dividend growth.Investors say they are skittish over the prospect of rising U.S. interest rates, a dimmer outlook for additional new volumes of oil and natural gas flowing onto new midstream systems, as well as the potential for lower shipments and fees on existing lines.

100,"  CALGARY, Alberta Dec 15 Kinder Morgan Inc  filed its final written argument for the Trans Mountain crude oil pipeline expansion project with Canadian regulators on Tuesday, in a bid to gain approval for shipping more oil sands crude to the Pacific Coast.The pipeline currently ships 300,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude from Edmonton, Alberta, to Burnaby, British Columbia. The proposed expansion will nearly treble capacity to 890,000 bpd, providing more access to Asian markets.Environmental groups, aboriginal groups and local landowners in British Columbia have mounted fierce opposition to the project, and are fighting to block the expansion. Many pipeline opposition groups have been emboldened by U.S. President Barack Obama's rejection earlier this year of TransCanada Corp's cross-border Keystone XL pipeline, and are seeking to stall other proposed export routes. Kinder Morgan first filed its facilities application with Canada's National Energy Board in December 2013, but was required to file replacement evidence for a 64-page report prepared by a consultant who was later appointed to the NEB. Lawyers for the pipeline will deliver their oral summary of the final argument to the National Energy Board in Calgary on Thursday.

101,"  The British Columbia government said on Monday it will formally oppose the expansion of Kinder Morgan Inc's Trans Mountain pipeline to Canada's west coast, another blow to oil sands producers already reeling from a global crude price crash.Kinder Morgan wants to nearly treble Trans Mountain's capacity to carry 890,000 barrels per day of crude from landlocked Alberta, to Burnaby, British Columbia, where it can be loaded on to tankers and shipped to lucrative Asian refining markets.Alberta's carbon-intensive oil sands producers are desperate for improved access to international markets for their heavy crude, which is among the cheapest in the world and was priced at about $16.50 a barrel outright late Thursday afternoon.But the C$5.4 billion ($3.79 billion) project has run into fierce environmental and aboriginal opposition.British Columbia Environment Minister Mary Polak said Kinder Morgan had failed to provide the National Energy Board (NEB), a federal regulator, with an adequate plan to prevent or respond to an oil spill.In 2012 the province's premier, Christy Clark, outlined five conditions that any company wanting to build pipelines in British Columbia would need to meet to win approval from her Liberal government. These included a ""world-leading"" marine and land oil spill prevention, response and recovery practices.     ""We have not seen evidence that convinces us that those five conditions have been met,"" Polak told reporters.The British Columbia government did not entirely rule out the possibility of Kinder Morgan meeting their requirements in future, adding that it will continue to evaluate the project.""It does not close the door on them meeting that test in the future,"" Polak said. Kinder Morgan is confident that it will be able to satisfy British Columbia's conditions by the time the regulatory process is complete, it said in a statement.It could not meet all the requirements such as Aboriginal treaty rights alone and needed ""multiple parties"" to work together, the company said.Kinder Morgan filed a final written argument for the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project with Canadian regulators in December. The opposition to Trans Mountain's expansion comes after U.S. President Barack Obama in November rejected TransCanada Corp's Keystone XL pipeline in a victory for environmentalists.The same month, Canada's recently elected Liberal government said it will impose an oil tanker ban on British Columbia's northern coast, effectively slamming the door on Enbridge Inc's Northern Gateway pipeline.($1 = 1.4230 Canadian dollars) (Reporting by Sneha Banerjee in Bengaluru, Nicole Mordant in Vancouver and Nia Williams in Calgary; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila and Richard Chang)",2016-01-11,KMI,"Mon Jan 11, 2016 | 3:51pm EST",British Columbia to oppose Kinder Morgan's pipeline expansion,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-kinder-morgan-de-pipeline-idUSKCN0UP1SP20160111?type=companyNews

116,"   By Jarrett Renshaw | NEW YORK  NEW YORK U.S. oil and gas pipeline companies including Williams Companies Inc and Kinder Morgan Inc have contracts worth billions of dollars that might be at risk as Chesapeake Energy Corp aims to slash its debts amid collapsing energy prices.Chesapeake said on Monday it had no plans to file for bankruptcy after sources told Reuters the firm, whose debt is eight times its market value, had asked its longtime counsel to look at restructuring options.The way it deals with its financial woes could be a lifeline or death sentence for midstream pipeline companies. Often called the energy market's ""toll takers,"" they have long-term contracts with producers such as Chesapeake to move, process and store energy products, experts said. Many of these companies are master-limited partnerships, or MLPs. Chesapeake said it has commitments to pay about $2 billion a year for space on pipelines run by MLPs, federal filings show.During the U.S. shale boom, investors flocked to MLPs, which were growing as much as 8 percent a year.But investors have fled in droves out of fear that the companies will not maintain their hefty dividend-style distributions.But with oil prices at their lowest in 12 years due to a global supply glut with OPEC unwilling to slow production, profits at energy companies have plummeted and analysts do not expect any significant price recovery until at least 2017.CONTRACT RENEGOTIATION LIKELY  Williams has the most exposure to Chesapeake after buying Chesapeake's logistics assets for $6 billion in 2014, Jay Hatfield, portfolio manager of New York-based InfraCap, said.Other companies with contracts include Spectra Energy Partners LP, Columbia Pipeline Partners LP and Marathon Petroleum Corp's unit MPLX LP, according to SEC filings.These long-term contracts, often referred to as minimum volume commitments, were supposed to protect MLPs from major oil and gas price drops, because they include so-called minimum volume commitments, where customers pay pipeline operators whether they move any oil or not. But the latest leg down in crude's 19-month plunge has cast doubt over the perceived safety of those contracts as producers try to navigate the oil crisis.Experts said they expect Chesapeake will try to renegotiate contract terms, which would be the first major test of these deals and the so-called midstream companies that flourished during the U.S. shale boom. Williams and Chesapeake announced in September they renegotiated a batch of gathering and processing contracts, shifting away from minimum commitments to fee-based agreements. The deals were considered precedent setting at the time.  Williams declined to comment.Another risk is it could file for bankruptcy protection, which could give it the option discontinuing or renegotiating commercial contracts.Hatfield said he expects Williams will be forced to accept a 50-percent price cut in its contract price with Chesapeake, either through the courts or mutual renegotiation.That translates to a drop of about $300 million in annual cash flow for the $4 billion company.  ""It's not good, but it's not the end of the world,"" Hatfield said.In a note issued on Monday, Credit Suisse said the loss of its minimum volume commitments with Chesapeake would likely wipe out most of Williams' cash flows connected to those contracts. It said the losses could be up to $400 million.Its shares plunged 35 percent to $11.16 on Monday on the Chesapeake news along with a management change at its bidder, Energy Transfer Equity LP.""Certainly on the midstream side, everyone realizes that midstream isn't bulletproof,"" Doug Getten, a partner in the Securities and Capital Markets practice at Paul Hastings in Houston, said.A Spectra spokesman said its Chesapeake contract to supply gas out of the Marcellus region accounted for less than 3 percent of its 2015 revenues.Kinder Morgan, which scrapped the MLP model in 2014 but still remains an industry bellwether, did not disclose its exposure to Chesapeake, but a spokesman said the company continues to closely monitor its counterparty credit risk.Columbia Pipeline said it would respond to these questions in an upcoming investor call. Marathon's logistics arm did not reply to requests for comment.

129,"  (Adds opposition and challenges to the pipeline)By Julie GordonVANCOUVER May 19 Canada's energy regulator on Thursday recommended the approval of Kinder Morgan Inc's  plan to expand its Trans Mountain oil pipeline, subject to 157 conditions, clearing a major hurdle for the proposed trebling of capacity to serve lucrative Asian markets.The National Energy Board (NEB) said it found the C$6.8 billion ($5.19 billion) project, which would boost capacity from 300,000 barrels per day to 890,000 bpd, would not cause significant harm to the environment.The decision prompted immediate outcry from critics, who called on Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to block the twinning of the existing pipeline, which carries oil from Alberta to a port in Metro Vancouver.Trudeau's cabinet has until December to review the NEB's 533-page report and make its final decision. If approved, legal experts say protests and a flood of lawsuits from aboriginal groups will likely follow. Aboriginals in British Columbia never signed treaties and have been granted ""consent"" rights by the courts, sometimes interpreted as a veto. But Trudeau told Reuters on Thursday that while community consultation was vital, aboriginal groups do not have a veto over pipeline development.Building new oil pipelines in Canada has proven difficult in recent years, even with approvals. Enbridge Inc's  Northern Gateway pipeline was greenlighted in 2014, but fierce legal and social opposition has so far hindered construction.That has weighed on Canada's oil sands producers, who are desperate for new lines to get their product to international markets, where it can fetch a higher price. The NEB said it had determined the ""considerable benefits"" of the Trans Mountain expansion outweighed the ""residual burdens."" It also found that with mitigation measures and its conditions, the project ""would not likely cause significant adverse environmental effects.""The agency did note that there would be significant effects related to the increase in oil tanker traffic, though marine shipping is not regulated by the NEB. The expansion would boost oil tanker and barge traffic on Vancouver's waters nearly five-fold. Twinning the Trans Mountain pipeline will include the construction of nearly 1,000 km (621 miles) of new pipeline and the expansion of an existing marine terminal.If approved by cabinet, the company said construction could start in 2017, with the first shipments in 2019.A ministerial panel, named earlier this week, is now tasked with consulting with aboriginal groups and other communities on the proposal, with their report due in November.($1 = 1.3090 Canadian dollars)   (Additional reporting by Nia Williams in Calgary; editing by Richard Chang, Cynthia Osterman and Bernard Orr)",2016-05-19,KMI,"Thu May 19, 2016 | 7:57pm EDT",UPDATE 3-Canada regulator approves Kinder Morgan pipeline with conditions,http://www.reuters.com//article/kinder-morgan-de-pipeline-approval-idUSL2N18G1YV?type=companyNews

134,"  (Adds comments from company, regulator)By Julie GordonVANCOUVER, June 20 The City of Vancouver said on Monday it had taken legal action against the Canadian energy regulator's approval of Kinder Morgan's Trans Mountain pipeline expansion, which would increase the number of oil tankers passing through city waters.In a statement posted on the city's website, Mayor Gregor Robertson called the review by the National Energy Board (NEB) ""flawed and biased"" and said that it ignored scientific evidence on the consequences of a major oil spill and the impact of greenhouse gas emissions. The city filed its application for judicial review at the Federal Court of Appeal in Vancouver on Friday. The suit aims to quash the NEB's recommendation in favour of Kinder Morgan's plan to nearly treble capacity on the pipeline, which carries crude from Alberta to a port in Metro Vancouver.The regulator said last month that it had found the C$6.8 billion ($5.31 billion) project, which would boost capacity from 300,000 barrels per day to 890,000 bpd and the number of oil tankers in Vancouver waters nearly seven-fold, would not cause significant harm to the environment. But critics, who say the project will hasten the development of Alberta's oil sands and worry about the impact of an oil spill on Canada's west coast, were quick to pledge action against the regulator's decision.The Squamish First Nation, whose traditional territories include areas directly impacted by the pipeline and shipping routes, filed an application for judicial review late last week. Environmental groups have also taken legal action. The regulator declined to comment on the specific court actions, noting that the scope of its review of projects such as the Trans Mountain expansion is mandated under federal law.Ali Hounsell, a spokeswoman for the expansion project, said the company is reviewing the applications and ""will be responding more fully through the court process.""The NEB's recommendation on the project must still be reviewed by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's cabinet, with a final decision expected in December.

143,"  Kinder Morgan Inc said on Tuesday it shut several natural gas pipeline segments near the King Ranch gas processing plant in Kleberg County, Texas, after a fire on Monday morning.The incident occurred in the area of a supply header where several pipes are connected, said Kinder Morgan spokesman Richard Wheatley.He said no Kinder Morgan employees were hurt in the incident, which occurred at about 9:26 a.m. CDT (1426 GMT), adding that an investigation would begin as soon as the site was judged safe and any remaining fires were put out.The incident affected service through certain Kinder Morgan segments, including the Texas pipeline, Tejas pipeline and Mexico-Monterrey pipeline, Wheatley said.""We have a team onsite and are attempting to gain full access to the location,"" Wheatley said, adding he was unable to say whether the fire started with a pipe owned by Kinder Morgan or another company.A spokesman at Williams Cos Inc said gas flows on its Transco pipeline, which is connected to the King Ranch processing plant, were not affected by the incident. Officials at Energy Transfer, which owns the processing plant, were not immediately available for comment.Gas flows between the King Ranch processing plant and Kinder Morgan's Tennessee Gas Pipeline fell to 9 million cubic feet per day on July 18, the day the fire started, but have returned to 88 mmcfd, putting the amount of fuel moving through the receipt point near its 30-day average of 91 mmcfd, according to Thomson Reuters data. Gas traders said the Texas fire was having little effect on futures prices, noting that the latest hot weather forecasts and maintenance work on the Rockies Express pipe in the Ohio/Indiana area was having a bigger impact on the market. ""We are in touch with our customers and are determining impacts to them,"" Wheatley said.He could not say how much gas was flowing through the pipes before the fire or how much had been curtailed. Wheatley said gas can still flow through the affected pipes, except sections that were shut in. In a notification to the state pollution regulator on the Tejas pipeline, Kinder Morgan said ""Sweet pipeline quality natural gas ignited.""The Tejas pipeline is a 3,400-mile intrastate system located primarily along the Texas Gulf Coast that transports, purchases and sells natural gas in the Texas intrastate market, according to the company website.

146,"   By Alastair Sharp and David Ljunggren | TORONTO/OTTAWA  TORONTO/OTTAWA Canada's federal government on Monday vowed to bring in a minimum price on carbon emissions by 2018, prompting one energy-producing province to threaten legal action and another to demand approval of an oil pipeline in return.Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who took power last November promising to do more to protect the environment, said carbon pollution would cost C$10 a tonne in 2018, rising by C$10 a year until it reaches C$50 in 2022.Trudeau said the 10 provinces - which have traditionally resented what they see as federal heavy handedness - could either implement a carbon tax or a cap-and-trade market by then. Those that do neither will have a price imposed by Ottawa.Trudeau said his measures would help Canada meet greenhouse gas emission cuts agreed under the Paris climate change accords.But official data show Canada has little chance of meeting its goals, in part because of booming emissions from the energy sector. Trudeau also blamed what he called inaction by the previous Conservative government.""We're not going to shun science and we're not going to put off the inevitable,"" Trudeau told parliament, saying a carbon price would improve Canadians' health and spur investment in green businesses. Energy-producing provinces were not impressed. Brad Wall, premier of Saskatchewan, accused Trudeau of betrayal and said he would consider legal action.Alberta Premier Rachel Notley - usually a political ally of Trudeau - said she would ""not be supporting this proposal absent serious concurrent progress on energy infrastructure"".This was a reference to Kinder Morgan Inc's proposal to twin its Trans Mountain crude pipeline from the Alberta oil sands to the Pacific coast. Ottawa has until Dec. 19 to decide on the project, which is opposed by environmentalists. Trudeau said provinces would keep the revenues they collected under the new program.He spoke as federal Environment Minister Catherine McKenna met provincial counterparts to work on a carbon pricing deal.In a sign of protest, three ministers left early, and a scheduled final news conference was canceled. Ontario, Quebec, British Columbia and Alberta, Canada's four most populous provinces, either already have a price on carbon or are implementing one.Green groups were largely supportive, although Environmental Defence said Trudeau's plan was not ambitious enough.Federal legislators will vote this week on ratification of the Paris agreement to  curb climate-warming emissions, a vote that the majority Liberal government is certain to win.

149,"  HOUSTON Kinder Morgan (KMI.N) will begin construction on its Elba Liquefaction project near Savannah, Georgia, on Nov. 1, ahead of a final ruling from federal regulators on rehearing requested by environmental activists, the company said on Wednesday. The company received approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) on June 1, but the Sierra Club and associated individuals have since filed a request for a rehearing, which is still pending FERC. The project, which is supported by a 20-year contract with Shell, will be constructed and operated next to the existing Elba Island liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal and have capacity to export 2.5 million tonnes per year of LNG. A number of other projects under construction by the midstream giant are facing regulatory and legal hurdles at a time when energy infrastructure projects in North America are drawing increased scrutiny from environmental and native American groups.  Kinder Morgan on Wednesday said it was appealing a decision by a judge in Wood County, Ohio, who ruled the company did not qualify for eminent domain for the construction of its proposed Utopia Pipeline. That line would transport 50,000 barrels per day (bpd) of ethane and ethane-propane mix across Ohio to Windsor, Ontario. The company has filed lawsuits for eminent domain in other counties in Ohio for construction of the line, executives said, adding they were able to obtain the property they sought. ""It is typical in all of our projects that we try to avoid use of eminent domain and we negotiate with a spectrum of landowners,"" executives said, noting about 65 percent of the land acquired for its pipeline construction comes through easements without eminent domain.The appeal could take months, Kinder Morgan said.  Kinder Morgan's Trans Mountain Pipeline expansion, which would increase capacity on the line from 300,000 bpd to 890,000 bpd, remains under review by Canadian government, after the National Energy Board recommended its approval, subject to 157 conditions. A decision on that project is expected on Dec. 20, 2016.

159,"  WINNIPEG, Manitoba A Husky Energy Inc oil spill into a major Canadian river last summer that cut off drinking water supply for two cities was caused by ground movement that buckled a section of pipeline, the company said in a report to the Saskatchewan provincial government.Husky's report, which the company made public on Thursday, said the break was not due to material defects, such as corrosion. A supporting report by engineering firm Stantec said heavy rain may have triggered the ground movement.The spill happened as the Canadian government considers whether to allow oil pipeline projects proposed by Kinder Morgan Inc and TransCanada Corp. Oil pipelines are viewed by the oil-rich provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan as critical to move crude to tidewater, but they have drawn fierce opposition from environmental and indigenous groups.  The Saskatchewan break, discovered by Husky on July 21, occurred on land about 160 metres (525 feet) from the North Saskatchewan River, and leaked an estimated 225 cubic metres (225,000 litres) of crude oil, the report said. Forty percent of the oil entered the river. Cleanup operations concluded in October accounted for 210 cubic metres.The spill forced the cities of Prince Albert and North Battleford to temporarily find alternative sources of drinking water. The province said in September that it had recorded 148 wildlife deaths, including birds and fish. ""We know the impact this incident had on communities and would like to acknowledge the extraordinary assistance we’ve received throughout,"" Husky spokesman Mel Duvall said in an email. ""From the beginning we have taken full responsibility and continue to do so.""Husky said it will review leak detection procedures and ensure ground movement risks to pipelines are monitored. Regulators continue to review the incident.

160,"   By Nia Williams | VANCOUVER  VANCOUVER If Canada approves Kinder Morgan's Trans Mountain pipeline expansion, the company's four-year campaign for the project will be far from over. Next up is a battle against hardening opposition amongst some communities along its planned route.The C$6.8 billion ($5.04 billion) project is a big step toward opening up Asian markets to supply from Canada's massive oil sands. Kinder Morgan plans to build a pipeline parallel to an existing line and nearly triple capacity on the artery to 890,000 barrels per day.Without the expansion, Canadian oil sands producers may find it too costly to ship crude by rail, missing out on billions of dollars of export revenue.First, the crude must travel from the conservative heart of the Canadian oil industry in Alberta across mountains and grasslands to the liberal West Coast. The further west on the route, the stiffer the resistance to the plan.The pipeline ends at Burnaby, part of Vancouver's urban sprawl, which already hosts fuel tanks and the marine terminal for the existing pipeline, as well as a refinery. In opposition to further development thousands have taken to the streets vowing to block bulldozers if Trans Mountain construction goes ahead.Ottawa has until Dec. 19 to decide whether to approve it, but the decision could come as soon as this week.   Burnaby mayor Derek Corrigan said he would join the protests even if could end his political career.""It's not nice to be a politician who has been 15 years in this office, to be heading into the end of my career with something that would show civil disobedience,"" Corrigan, 65, told Reuters. ""I lose sleep about whether or not this is going to turn into being something ugly.""The backlash against a plan to build on sites already dedicated to energy infrastructure shows how entrenched opposition to new energy projects in North America has become.It also shows how the government is struggling to soothe public concerns despite its pledge to give local communities greater say in the approval process. Pipeline opponents - British Columbia municipalities, aboriginal groups and environmentalists - are fighting the expansion for reasons ranging from climate change concerns to fears of tanker spills, pipeline leaks or tank farm fires. INSPIRATION FROM THE SOUTH They draw inspiration from the fate of Enbridge's stalled Northern Gateway pipeline, TransCanada's rejected Keystone XL and protests against the Dakota Access pipeline built in the United States by Energy Transfer Partners. ""Simply because the government will issue a grandiose statement of approval does not mean the project will ever see the light of day,"" Grand Chief Stewart Phillip of the Union of BC Chiefs, an aboriginal organization, told Reuters in on the eve of a 3,000-strong anti-Trans Mountain rally in Vancouver's center.In an emailed response to Reuters, the project's media team cited Kinder Morgan's strong safety record in the area, but said it had not expected consensus on the project given a wide range of interests and opinions. It noted that the Canadian energy regulator had approved the new pipeline with 157 ""rigorous, but achievable"" conditions that address environmental and safety concerns that Kinder Morgan is committed to meet.The pipeline starts from a 140-acre (0.57 square km) tank farm outside of Edmonton where, like elsewhere in Alberta, new export pipelines enjoy public support as a way to revive the oil province's stuttering economy.About 800 kilometers (497 miles) west in Kamloops, a south central British Columbia city that unlike most of the province voted Conservative in the 2015 federal election, the local businesses and the mayor also back the pipeline.""Communities along the interior route have a familiarity with resource-based projects and what they bring,"" Kinder Morgan Canada President Ian Anderson said at a Kamloops Chamber of Commerce event this month.But further west, the sentiment turns against the pipeline. Earlier this month Liberal lawmaker Ron McKinnon urged Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to reject the expansion because of ""overwhelming"" opposition on the west coast, where his party did unexpectedly well in the last election. A recent poll commissioned by one of environmental groups found nearly a third of British Columbia's Liberal voters said they would be less likely to support the party if Trans Mountain goes ahead.From Kamloops the pipeline climbs over the steep Coquihalla Pass, which separates interior British Columbia from the Fraser Valley and the coast. As the vegetation turns from semi-arid scrublands to temperate rainforest and the route enters the fertile farming region, opposition intensifies. GRANDMOTHERS AND BULLDOZERS ""I know five grandmothers who will go and lie down in front of bulldozers...and I will absolutely join them,"" said Michael Hale, 72, a co-founder of Yarrow Eco Village near Chilliwack, a 20-acre farm under which the existing pipeline runs.""They may bring in the army, they may throw me in jail, but when I get out I will come back,"" he said.The pipeline ends at Burnaby Mountain tank farm near the Westridge marine terminal, which Kinder Morgan aims to expand to load 34 oil tankers a month from five now. Burnaby deputy fire chief Chris Bowcock says the planned increase in the number of oil storage tanks on Burnaby Mountain from 13 to 27 would raise the risk of a single tank fire spreading across the complex.Opponents, among them Vancouver mayor Gregor Robertson, also fear a potential oil spill would cripple the local economy powered by the Port of Vancouver, tourism, and increasingly, the film industry.Kinder Morgan says it is investing in extra safeguards to mitigate the probability of a tanker spill but opponents say the risk to the rugged coastline is too great.""Our first mother is the water,"" said Reuben George of the Tsleil-Waututh First Nation, whose lands face Westridge dock. ""We will do anything to protect it and we will not let the pipeline go through.""The aboriginal group is planning litigation if the government approves the project.In June, two conservation groups filed a lawsuit challenging the energy regulator's positive recommendation saying the oil tankers' route cut across a habitat of an 80-strong pod of killer whales protected under Canada's Species at Risk Act.If legal action fails, Trans Mountain's opponents say they will resort to civil disobedience. This month in Vancouver environmental groups gave free training on mass protests, blockades, and de-escalating confrontations with police.Asked how Kinder Morgan might respond, Anderson told reporters in Kamloops the company was prepared to talk to all who had a view about the project.""We'll see what unfolds and hopefully we can get through this period in a respectful way.""  (Editing by Simon Webb and Tomasz Janowski)",2016-11-28,KMI,"Tue Nov 29, 2016 | 5:14pm EST","RPT-Canada pipeline opponents ready to take on Kinder Morgan, Ottawa",http://www.reuters.com//article/canada-pipeline-transmountain-idUSL1N1DT01Q?type=companyNews
