0,"  (Adds DaVita, DOJ response)NEW YORK, March 24 Humana Inc, one of the largest U.S. providers of Medicare Advantage healthcare plans for older people, said on Tuesday that it believes a previously disclosed government query for information is part of a wider review involving many healthcare companies.Humana first said the U.S. Department of Justice had asked it to volunteer information about risk adjustment matters on Feb. 18.""Humana believes that this request for information is in connection with a wider review of Medicare risk adjustment generally that includes a number of Medicare Advantage plans, providers and vendors,"" the company said in a regulatory filing on Tuesday. The disclosure came the morning after DaVita Healthcare Partners Inc said in a regulatory filing that its JSA Medical Group unit had received a subpoena from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Inspector General. JSA provides medical services through clinics and pharmacies.DaVita said it had been advised by a Justice Department lawyer that the subpoena related to a civil investigation of Humana and its service providers' risk adjustment practices and data including patient diagnoses. DaVita said the time period involved was from 2008 through 2013 and that the subpoena related in particular to two Florida physicians that had previously contracted with it.The government makes risk adjustment payments to Humana and other companies that provide Medicare Advantage when they have patients who are sicker than average. ""As matter of policy, the department generally neither confirms nor denies the existence of an investigation,"" Justice Department spokeswoman Nicole Navas said.Susquehanna analyst Chris Rigg said in a research note that the Humana disclosure fit with the DaVita request and a notice to insurers from a Health and Human Services division earlier this year about its review of the use of patient in-home risk assessments by insurers.Humana shares were up 0.4 percent at $182.77 in morning trading. DaVita was down 0.6 percent at $82.32.

1,"   By Jonathan Stempel  DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc, one of the largest U.S. kidney dialysis providers, said it agreed to pay $450 million to settle a whistleblower lawsuit accusing it of deliberately wasting medicines in order to receive higher Medicare payments.The lawsuit alleged that DaVita, whose largest shareholder is Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc, used larger-than-necessary medicine vials or unnecessarily spread medicine dosages across multiple treatments, knowing that Medicare would pay for what it considered ""unavoidable"" waste.An agreement in principle to settle was disclosed in an April 16 filing with the U.S. federal court in Atlanta.DaVita made the terms public on Monday, when it reported a first-quarter loss that reflected a $298 million after-tax charge for the settlement. The Denver-based company set aside $495 million for the accord, including $45 million for legal fees and costs.""Although we believe strongly in the merits of our case, we decided it was in our stakeholders' best interests to resolve it,"" DaVita Chief Legal Officer Kim Rivera said in a statement. ""The potential mandatory penalties for being found in the wrong in even a small percentage of instances were simply too large."" The named plaintiffs were Alon Vainer, a nephrologist who has worked in dialysis clinics in Georgia, and Daniel Barbir, a registered nurse from that state.Their lawsuit brought under the federal False Claims Act began in October 2007. It was unsealed in July 2011 after the U.S. Department of Justice decided not to join it, often a sign it believes the case is not strong enough. In separate emails, L. Lin Wood and Marlan Wilbanks, lawyers for the plaintiffs, said their clients were pleased, and that they believed the settlement is a record for a whistleblower case that lacked government support.""Dr. Vainer and Nurse Barbir exhibited great courage and determination"" in pursuing the case, whose result ""primarily benefits the taxpayers of the United States,"" Wood said.DaVita posted a first-quarter loss of $110.6 million, or 52 cents per share, compared with a year-earlier profit of $183.3 million, or 85 cents. Excluding the settlement, profit was 86 cents per share, matching analyst forecasts according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net revenue rose 8 percent to $3.29 billion. Berkshire owned 17.9 percent of DaVita as of Dec. 31, Reuters data show.DaVita shares closed down 6 cents at $82.34 in regular trading on Monday on the New York Stock Exchange. The company announced results after U.S. markets closed.

3,"   By Jessica Dye  A federal judge in Colorado has declined to certify a class of patients who said Colorado-based healthcare clinic operator DaVita Healthcare Partners administered potentially hazardous dialysis products that increased their risk of suffering a heart attack. On Thursday, U.S. District Judge R. Brooke Jackson in Colorado said that individual issues were ""so central"" to plaintiffs' claims that certifying a class of as many as 300,000 members ""would not achieve significant economies of time, effort and expense.""
