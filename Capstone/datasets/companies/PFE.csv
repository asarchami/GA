0,"  * TSX rises 10.90 points, or 0.08 percent, to 13,692.38     * Six of 10 main index sectors advance     * Valeant is market's biggest positive influence     * Shaw slips after quarterly report      By John Tilak     TORONTO, Jan 14 Canada's main stock index edged higher on Tuesday as Valeant Pharmaceuticals gained after a report indicated its interest in a unit of Pfizer Inc  and telecoms shares rose after Globalive pulled out of a wireless auction.     Valeant shares climbed after Reuters reported that the drugmaker had expressed interest in buying Pfizer's branded generics business.      Investors were also encouraged as a gauge of U.S. consumer spending rose more than expected in December, indicating greater momentum for the world's biggest economy and lifting sentiment.       However, a decline in shares of Shaw Communications Inc , following the cable company's quarterly report, capped the gains.     Tuesday's modest advance was the benchmark index's fifth positive session in the last six trading days.     ""One of the game changers in 2014 could be macro risks fading and a global synchronized recovery emerging,"" said Paul Taylor, chief investment officer at BMO Asset Management, who sees the Toronto market benefiting from those trends.     Taylor, who expects the TSX to perform in sync with U.S. stocks this year, said the index could end 2014 at around 14,500.     The Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P/TSX composite index  closed up 10.90 points, or 0.08 percent, at 13,692.38.     Six of the 10 main sectors on the index were higher.     The telecoms group added 0.6 percent as Globalive's decision to stay out of a wireless auction boosted the big players. Rogers Communications gained 1.7 percent to C$47.86, Telus Corp advanced 0.6 percent to C$37.03, and BCE Inc  rose 0.7 percent to C$46.72.      Valeant jumped 4 percent to C$147.51 and had the biggest positive influence on the market. The move also helped push the healthcare sector up 1.3 percent.     Gold-mining shares gave back 1.2 percent. Goldcorp Inc  shed 2.6 percent to C$24.34, and Barrick Gold Corp  lost 1.2 percent to C$19.49.     Shaw shares slipped 1.7 percent to C$24.88 after the company posted a 4 percent rise in first-quarter profit but said it continued to lose customers in its main cable television business.

1,"   By Nadia Damouni, Jessica Toonkel and Soyoung Kim | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Drugmakers Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc (VRX.TO), Actavis Plc ACT.N and Mylan Inc (MYL.O) have all expressed interest in buying Pfizer Inc's (PFE.N) branded generics business, but no active discussions are going on at this time, according to three people close to the matter.The ""established products"" unit, which makes off-patent drugs, had global sales of $7 billion in the first nine months of 2013, accounting for 18 percent of Pfizer's revenue. Pfizer said in July it planned to separate its commercial operations into three units -- two mainly for patent-protected brands and the third for generics.According to the people close to the matter, Pfizer is aware of each of the companies' interest but is not yet ready to entertain a deal as it prepares the groundwork for a potential separation of the generics business. It has said the review could take three years.Pfizer, Valeant, Actavis and Mylan all declined to comment. All the sources asked not to be named because they were not authorized to speak with the media.A deal for the business -- which houses medicines that have lost market exclusivity, as well as mature, patent-protected products that are expected to lose exclusivity through 2015 -- could catapult a buyer like Valeant into the ranks of the biggest pharmaceutical companies in the world, but several hurdles remain.The Pfizer generics business is far bigger than the three pharmaceutical companies. Valeant had $3.7 billion in revenue in the first nine months of 2013, while Mylan and Actavis posted revenues of $5.10 billion and $5.9 billion, respectively.Structuring a deal would also be a challenge because a sale could incur heavy taxes for Pfizer. One way to reduce the tax bill would be to use a structure known as a Reverse Morris Trust, according to the people close to the matter.In that structure, a company spins off a unit that it wants to divest and that unit merges with a smaller company, with the smaller company running the combined entity. Overall, the transaction allows a parent company to sell a subsidiary in a tax-free manner. It is not clear whether Pfizer would entertain such a deal structure.Another challenge for potential buyers is the lack of historical financial information for the generics business, as Pfizer's efforts to split its commercial operations is a work in progress.Still, such a deal could be attractive, as it could immediately boost the buyer's earnings and increase its presence outside of North America, most importantly in emerging markets where many companies need to expand. Valeant has kept no secret of its desire to grow through acquisitions. Its chief executive officer, Michael Pearson, said this month that the company wants to become one of the world's top five pharmaceutical companies by market capitalization by the end of 2016, largely through acquisitions.Pearson also said that Valeant, which bought contact lens maker Bausch & Lomb Holdings Inc for $8.7 billion in August, is looking at a merger of equals as well as smaller deals. He said it will look this year to pull off one acquisition of a similar size as its Bausch purchase.Valeant also held talks with Actavis about a potential combination last year, although those discussions did not lead to a deal, according to media reports at the time.Meanwhile, Actavis completed a $8.5 billion deal to buy Warner Chilcott Plc in October, months after rejecting a takeover offer from Mylan.(Reporting by Nadia Damouni, Jessica Toonkel and Soyoung Kim in New York; Editing by Paritosh Bansal and Leslie Adler)",2014-01-14,PFE,"Tue Jan 14, 2014 | 6:23am EST","Exclusive: Valeant, Actavis, Mylan eye Pfizer's generics unit",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-pfizer-valeant-idUSBREA0D0CZ20140114?type=companyNews
2,"   By Ransdell Pierson  Pfizer Inc on Monday said one of its experimental drugs had failed to meet its goals in two late-stage studies among patients who had received prior treatment for advanced non-small cell lung cancer, the most common form of the disease.Although Pfizer continues to test the drug, called dacomitinib, in another Phase III study, hopes for its success have now largely faded, according to ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum.""We believe consensus expectations (for the drug) will be close to zero given today's readout"" of unsuccessful trial results, Schoenebaum said in a research note.In one of the failed trials, called ARCHER 1009, patients given Pfizer's once-daily pill did not show improved survival without the cancer worsening, compared with Roche Holding AG's widely used Tarceva (erlotinib).Tarceva is the current standard of care in patients with mutated forms of a protein called Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR). The protein plays a role in normal regulation of cell growth, but when mutated is believed to cause cells to proliferate and thereby help spur various types of cancer. Dacomitinib is designed to block several types of Epidermal Growth Factor receptors, while Tarceva and similar treatments for lung cancer target only one type of receptor.Cowen and Co had forecast annual sales of $500 million by 2020 for dacomitinib, if it were approved for lung cancer. That would make it a moderate-sized product for Pfizer, the largest U.S. drugmaker, which has annual revenue of $50 billion. Schoenebaum said there has been little investor interest in the drug and that Wall Street had expected it to generate annual sales of only $300 million by 2018.The second failed trial, named BR.26, involved patients that previously had failed to benefit from chemotherapy as well as from treatment with an EGFR inhibitor.Overall survival of patients taking the Pfizer drug was not prolonged in the study, compared with patients given a placebo. Pfizer said adverse events seen with dacomitinib were consistent with those seen in smaller earlier studies.In the meantime, Pfizer said dacomitinib is also being tested in a third late-stage trial, called ARCHER 1050, among patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer who have not received prior treatment. The study will compare dacomitinib with Iressa (gefitinib), an EGFR inhibitor sold by AstraZeneca Plc. Results from that study are expected in 2015.Pfizer shares were little changed in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.(Additional reporting By Vrinda Manocha in Bangalore; Editing by Savio D'Souza and Sofina Mirza-Reid)",2014-01-27,PFE,"Mon Jan 27, 2014 | 10:45am EST",Pfizer lung cancer drug fails in two large studies,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-pfizer-lungcancerdrug-idUSBREA0Q0NL20140127?type=companyNews

Other drugmakers, including Merck & Co (MRK.N) and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (BMY.N), are racing to develop a different class of cancer drugs called PD-1 inhibitors that enable the immune system to recognize cancer cells and attack them.Dolsten said Pfizer's own experimental immuno oncology drugs might be able to be used in combination with PD-1 inhibitors and other cancer drugs that target specific proteins.

12,"   By Ransdell Pierson  Pfizer Inc's experimental breast cancer drug significantly delayed progression of symptoms in a mid-stage trial, meeting the study's primary goal and keeping Pfizer in the forefront of a race for a new standard of care for the disease.Pfizer shares were up nearly 4 percent on positive findings for the oral treatment, called palbociclib, one of the company's most important experimental drugs that some analysts believe could eventually claim annual sales of more than $5 billion, if approved.The trial tested the pill in post-menopausal patients with locally advanced or newly diagnosed breast cancer that had spread to other parts of the body.""We are delighted with the final data,"" Pfizer said in a release, adding the company will discuss the successful data on progression-free survival with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ""to determine next steps"" for palbociclib.A secondary goal of the study is to determine whether palbociclib can prolong overall survival. But Pfizer spokeswoman Sally Beatty said the company does not yet have such data, because it takes longer periods to follow patients and gauge survival trends.Although Pfizer is conducting two larger late-stage trials of palbociclib, ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum noted the company has previously said it might discuss with the FDA the potential to seek approval of the medicine based upon mid-stage trial data, if the data warranted.Palbociclib, which blocks enzymes known as cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) 4 and 6, was taken in combination with a standard treatment called letrozole among women who were estrogen receptor positive - meaning tumors grow in response to estrogen - and HER2-negative, meaning that the HER2 protein is not causing the cancer. Such patients make up about 60 percent of advanced breast cancer cases. Letrozole is the chemical name of Femara, a Novartis AG drug that belongs to a class of treatments called aromatase inhibitors that block production of estrogen.Pfizer on Monday did not present detailed data from the trial results, saying they would be presented at a scientific meeting in San Diego in April.HIGHLY IMPRESSIVE EARLIER DATA The success of the trial, called Paloma-1, follows highly favorable interim data that Pfizer unveiled in December 2012. At that point in the study, those taking both palbociclib and letrozole went an average of 26.1 months before tumors worsened. That compared with 7.5 months for those taking letrozole, but not palbociclib. The 18.6-month difference was considered statistically significant. Side effects from palbociclib were similar to those previously reported, Pfizer said on Monday. The earlier interim results had shown that patients taking the drug combination experienced anemia, fatigue and neutropenia - a decline in white blood cells called neutrophils that can put patients at higher risk of infection.Palbociclib was designated a ""breakthrough"" drug by the FDA last April based on initial data from the trial.The FDA grants ""breakthrough"" status to drugs that may offer substantial improvement over existing treatments for serious or life-threatening diseases. The status helps to speed up the approval process. Pfizer has started two late-stage trials of the drug - Paloma-2 and Paloma-3 - in patients with advanced breast cancer.Paloma-2 will test the same drug combination, palbociclib and letrozole, as an initial treatment for breast cancer.Paloma-3 will evaluate palbociclib in combination with another hormone therapy, fulvestrant, in women whose cancer has progressed after hormonal therapy. The drug, sold under the brand name Faslodex by AstraZeneca Plc, is called an estrogen receptor antagonist.Companies trying to develop treatments similar to palbociclib include Novartis and Eli Lilly & Co.Breast cancer killed more than 508,000 women worldwide in 2011, according to the World Health Organization.Pfizer shares were up 3.7 percent at $31.53 on Monday morning on the New York Stock Exchange.(Reporting by Ransdell Pierson in New York; additional reporting by Esha Dey in Bangalore; editing by Ted Kerr and Matthew Lewis)",2014-02-03,PFE,"Mon Feb 3, 2014 | 11:28am EST",Pfizer breast cancer drug succeeds in mid-stage trial,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-pfizer-study-cancer-idUSBREA120OD20140203?type=companyNews

16,"  WASHINGTON Feb 6 Pfizer Inc, the world's largest drugmaker, has beaten back generic competition for the pain medicine Lyrica, its biggest product, with a U.S. appeals court ruling that competing generic products would infringe on the company's patents.The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which handles all patent appeals, ruled on Thursday that Teva Pharmaceuticals USA Inc, Lupin Ltd, Actavis Inc and other generic competitors had infringed on Pfizer's patents.The decision upholds a ruling by the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware that said that the generic versions may not be sold. Lyrica, which is approved to treat neuropathic pain caused by diabetes, shingles and other conditions, is Pfizer's biggest product, with global sales in 2013 of $4.6 billion.

17,"  By Toni ClarkeFeb 11 An advisory panel to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said on Tuesday that available evidence does not prove that the painkiller naproxen, sold under the brand names Aleve and Naprosyn, carries a lower cardiac risk than rival products.The panel was convened after a retrospective analysis from multiple clinical trials published last year in The Lancet suggested naproxen was less dangerous to the heart than other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen and Celebrex.Panelists recommended the FDA leave the current product labeling as is, at least pending the outcome of a large ongoing study, known as Precision, that compares naproxen with ibuprofen and Celebrex. The FDA is not bound to follow the advice of its advisory panels, but typically does so.The FDA's final decision could have wide implications for the way in which these drugs are prescribed and used in the future, and it will have implications for whether the Precision trial is able to continue. The panel voted 16-9 that while the retrospective combining of results from different studies, known as meta-analysis, hints at a relative benefit for naproxen over other NSAIDs, the data is not reliable and does not warrant changing the prescribing information to reflect a differentiated risk.""Meta-analyses are good for raising questions but not settling them,"" said panelist Dr. Sanjay Kaul, a cardiologist and professor at UCLA School of Medicine.In 2005 the FDA determined that all NSAIDs should carry a warning about cardiovascular risk but said there was no evidence that the drugs carried different levels of risk. While the panel agreed that more information has come to light since then, they are looking to Precision to answer the question once and for all. Naprosyn is a prescription product sold by Roche Holding AG , while Aleve is sold over the counter by Bayer AG . Ibuprofen is marketed as Advil by Pfizer Inc  and Motrin by Johnson & Johnson. Celebrex is a prescription product made by Pfizer.Over-the-counter generic versions of both naproxen and ibuprofen are also available. One of the key questions in front of the panel was whether to modify the Precision trial, which has been going on for seven years at the request of the FDA. The trial is being funded by Pfizer and run by the Cleveland Clinic.Dr. Steven Nissen, chairman of the clinic's Department of Cardiovascular Medicine and lead investigator on the Precision study, told the panel the trial has enrolled nearly 27,000 patients, more than 95 percent of the total needed, and that he expects it to be complete around the end of 2015.Precision is an academically directed trial whose scientific governance resides with an unpaid independent executive committee, Nissen said, and represents the best opportunity to date to answer long-standing questions about the safety of NSAIDs that the FDA has been wrestling with since the withdrawal of Merck & Co.'s Vioxx a decade ago after it was linked to an increased risk of heart attack.Dr. Garret FitzGerald, director of the Institute for Translational Medicine and Therapeutics at the University of Pennsylvania who helped craft the meta-analysis published in The Lancet, told the panel that waiting for the Precision results would shed little light on the relative risk of the drugs.In the end, the panel recommended waiting for Precision and said there should be no modification to the way the trial is being conducted.",2014-02-11,PFE,"Tue Feb 11, 2014 | 4:05pm EST",UPDATE 2-FDA panel says data does not support lower heart risk of naproxen,http://www.reuters.com//article/painkillers-fda-idUSL2N0LG1IY20140211?type=companyNews

20,"  (Adds details on standard Pneumovax vaccine, updates share price, final two paragraphs)By Ransdell Pierson and Caroline HumerFeb 24 Pfizer Inc said on Monday that Prevnar 13, its blockbuster vaccine against childhood infections, prevented pneumonia outside of hospitals in people age 65 and older, in one of the largest drug trials ever conducted.The 85,000-patient study, called CAPiTA, also showed that Prevnar 13 prevented invasive pneumococcal disease, meaning infections of Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteria in the bloodstream and other normally sterile sites in the body.Wall Street analysts have predicted that success of the trial would boost annual sales of Prevnar 13 by $1 billion or more, as doctors steer elderly patients to the product.""We expect the U.S. and other developed markets to broadly recommend adult use of the product,"" given favorable results from the study, J.P. Morgan analyst Chris Schott said in a research note. Schott said he expects Prevnar 13 sales among adults of $300 million in 2015, rising to $1.5 billion in future years as it is more widely used for that population.An estimated 300,000 adults aged 50 and older are hospitalized every year because of pneumococcal pneumonia, a substantial cause of illness and death, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.Prevnar 13, sold under the brand name Prevenar 13 in many markets outside the United States, is one of Pfizer's biggest products. The drug, and an older version of the vaccine known as Prevnar 7, have annual sales of $4.4 billion, making them the company's second-biggest franchise. During the trial, Prevnar 13 met its primary goal of preventing a first episode of community-acquired pneumonia. It also met a secondary goal of preventing a first episode of invasive bloodstream infections, which are typically far more severe than pneumonia without such bloodstream involvement.Pfizer said data from the study, conducted in the Netherlands, would be presented at a medical meeting in India next month.The FDA in early 2010 approved Prevnar 13, to protect children against additional strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteria that cause an array of diseases, including pneumonia, ear infections and meningitis. But the U.S. health regulator in late 2011 widened the approved use of Prevnar 13 to include adults age 50 and older, to prevent pneumonia and invasive infections. The approval was conditioned, however, on success of the now-completed CAPiTA study.Favorable data from the study are expected to be added to the package insert label of Prevnar 13, greatly boosting the attractiveness of the vaccine to doctors with elderly patients.Tim Anderson, an analyst with Sanford Bernstein & Co, said relatively few adults have yet been vaccinated with Prevnar 13. He predicted adult sales will rise to $1.3 billion in 2020 and that total sales of the Prevnar franchise will rise to $6 billion that year.The standard pneumonia vaccine, Pneumovax from Merck & Co , is approved to prevent pneumococcal disease in patients 50 years and older and children as young as 2 at risk of pneumococcal infections. But it is not considered highly effective.Pfizer shares rose 1.7 percent to $31.99 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange, amid a 0.7 percent gain for the ARCA Pharmaceutical Index of large U.S. and European drugmakers.

24,"  A U.S. court ruled invalid a patent covering Pfizer Inc's blockbuster Celebrex painkiller, the drugmaker said, giving generic rivals an earlier U.S. entry that analysts estimated could cost the company $3 billion in revenue by the end of 2015.Pfizer shares closed down 1.4 percent on the New York Stock Exchange.Pfizer said it would appeal the ruling, made by the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, which invalidated a patent covering how Celebrex is administered to treat osteoarthritis.Celebrex has annual global sales of about $3 billion, including $2 billion in the United States. It is the fourth-biggest product for Pfizer, which has total annual company sales of about $52 billion. Pfizer, in its full-year 2014 profit forecast, had assumed Celebrex would maintain its U.S. marketing exclusivity through December 2, 2015 based on the so-called method of use patent, Morningstar analyst Damien Conover said. He said the court's decision, if not overturned on appeal, could cost Pfizer $1 billion in revenues this year and $2 billion next year.Conover said he had been surprised by Pfizer's confidence in the method of use patent, because they are rarely upheld by U.S. courts. The drug's basic chemical patent lapses on May 30, 2014, and generic companies including Teva Pharmaceuticals Inc and Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc have sought approval to sell their cheaper versions at that point.

25,"   By Ransdell Pierson | March 12  March 12 Pfizer Inc's Prevnar 13 vaccine, designed to protect against pneumonia, performed well in a large-scale trial among elderly patients, boosting the chances of strong sales of the blockbuster product, analysts said.The trial, whose results were announced on Wednesday, cut by 46 percent initial episodes of pneumonia acquired outside of hospitals from infection with a common family of bacteria.The study also showed that adults aged 65 and older who were immunized with the vaccine were 75 percent less likely, compared with patients taking placebos, to develop ""invasive"" infections in the bloodstream with Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteria, with or without pneumonia. That secondary goal of the trial was achieved by an impressive margin. Meeting another secondary goal, there was a 45 percent reduced incidence of first situations in which the pneumonia was caused by the bacteria, but the bacteria were not detected in the bloodstream or any other normally sterile site in the body.Pfizer last month said Prevnar 13, used mainly to prevent infections with the bacteria in young children, had met primary and secondary goals of the 85,000-patient trial, called CAPiTA. But the largest U.S. drugmaker, at the time, did not provide clinical data from the study, which was conducted in the Netherlands. Prevnar 13, sold under the brand name Prevenar 13 in many markets outside the United States, is one of Pfizer's biggest products. It and an older version of the vaccine known as Prevnar 7 have combined annual sales of $4.4 billion, making them the company's second-biggest franchise.J.P. Morgan analyst Chris Schott on Wednesday said he expects $300 million of Prevnar 13 sales in the adult population in 2015, thanks to the ""robust"" data in the CAPiTA study, growing to $1.5 billion over time. Alex Arfaei, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets, was far more bullish. He called the results of the trial ""positive and better than our expectations"" and predicted adult sales of Prevnar 13 would reach $4.1 billion in 2016.Arfaei, in a research note, predicted especially strong demand among adults outside of the United States in countries where smoking and other factors make people more vulnerable.

26,"  By Ransdell PiersonMarch 17 Amgen Inc said its experimental new type of  cholesterol-fighting drug met the primary goal of a late-stage trial by slashing ""bad"" LDL cholesterol levels in patients with a genetic tendency towards high levels of the artery-clogging fat.Amgen said on Monday patients given its injectable drug evolocumab once a month, on top of standard daily statin treatments, showed ""clinically meaningful"" improvement compared with taking statins alone after 12 weeks of treatment. The drug is also known as AMG-145.The Phase 3 study, called TESLA, involved 49 adult and adolescent patients with a rare condition called homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. The condition, seen in about one in a million individuals, can cause a four-fold increase in levels of LDL cholesterol, greatly raising the risk of heart disease.Evolocumab works by blocking PCSK9, a naturally occurring protein that keeps LDL levels elevated in the bloodstream. Other drugmakers, including Pfizer Inc, and a partnership between Regeneron Inc and Sanofi, are racing with Amgen to complete trials of potentially lucrative anti-PCSK9 antibodies.""You could have two or three drugs here, each with upwards of $3 billion to $4 billion in annual sales,"" said Richard Purkiss, an analyst with Atlantic Equities.The PCSK9 inhibitors are one of the most closely followed new classes of medicines, Purkiss said, even though they will probably not be prescribed for the average patient with high cholesterol. If approved, ""they would be used mainly for very high-risk patients, who have frustratingly high LDL despite statin treatment,"" he said.Purkiss said Regeneron and Sanofi had been ahead of the pack in terms of completing clinical trials, but that Amgen's trials had picked up speed and its drug could be the first to market.In Amgen's now-completed TESLA study, the safety risk was similar between those taking evolocumab in combination with statins, and those taking statins alone, Amgen said, with the most common adverse events including upper respiratory tract infection, gastrointestinal inflammation and stuffy nose. Data from the trial will be presented at a future medical conference, Amgen said. The world's largest biotechnology company noted that favorable results have previously been reported in five other Phase III trials of its experimental medicine, which involved different populations.They have included trials among mainstream populations whose high cholesterol is not due to serious genetic causes, as well as trials among those who cannot tolerate statins and instead take a different type of cholesterol fighter called Zetia (ezetimibe) from Merck & Co.In mid-stage studies, evolocumab has cut LDL levels by as much as 60 percent more than with statins alone.Such results have bolstered faith among doctors and industry analysts that the drug and other PCSK9 inhibitors might be a good option for patients who are unable to reach target LDL levels with statins and other standard treatments.Amgen shares were up 1.8 percent in midday trading on the Nasdaq, amid a 1.5 percent gain for the NYSARC Biotech Index .",2014-03-17,PFE,"Mon Mar 17, 2014 | 12:24pm EDT",UPDATE 2-Amgen drug meets goal for those with high genetic cholesterol,http://www.reuters.com//article/amgen-cholesterol-idUSL2N0ME0N020140317?type=companyNews

Xalkori, with current annual sales of about $350 million, is expected to get a significant boost from the new data. Cowen and Co has predicted the medicine will generate annual peak sales of $1.05 billion by 2020. Pfizer is also developing an array of other cancer medicines that work through new mechanisms, with the aim of becoming a major player in the oncology field.Pfizer shares were up 0.6 percent at $31.67 in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

29,"  March 25 Pfizer Inc's Xalkori delayed progression of lung cancer longer than chemotherapy in patients who had never previously been treated for the disease, according to results of a late-stage study released on Tuesday.The medicine, which received U.S. approval in 2011 for lung cancer patients who have a specific gene mutation, had shown in a previous Phase III trial that it significantly delayed disease progression among those who have already undergone chemotherapy for non-small-cell lung cancer, the most common form of the illness. The drug is used among patients who have a mutation in the so-called ALK gene, as determined by an approved diagnostic test. The mutation only occurs in a small percentage of patients with lung cancer, but makes them good candidates for treatment with Xalkori.

30,"   By Bill Berkrot and Ransdell Pierson | WASHINGTON, March 29  WASHINGTON, March 29 Amgen Inc's drug from a high profile new class of experimental medicines lowered ""bad"" LDL cholesterol by 55 percent to 66 percent compared with a placebo in a trio of late-stage clinical trials, according to data presented on Saturday.Amgen had previously said the drug, evolocumab, met the main goals of five late-stage trials involving some 4,000 patients by significantly outperforming placebo or another cholesterol medicine in a variety of patient populations.Saturday's presentation at the American College of Cardiology scientific meeting in Washington marked the first time the magnitude of LDL lowering and other details from the late stage studies were unveiled. Results of the other two Phase III studies will be presented at the meeting on Sunday.The data also showed that two dosing regimens of the injected drug - 140 milligrams every two weeks or 420 mg once a month - were equally effective in reducing LDL levels.""We're seeing excellent efficacy and the safety profile appears no different than placebo, so you can't get better than that,"" Dr. Michael Koren, one of the lead investigators on two of the evolocumab studies, said in a telephone interview.Evolocumab belongs to a highly promising class of drugs called PCSK9 inhibitors that block a protein that reduces the liver's ability to remove LDL from the blood. They are expected to be used in patients who cannot tolerate widely used and highly effective statins, such as Pfizer Inc's  Lipitor, and in those unable to get their cholesterol levels low enough using currently available medicines.""In terms of the LDL lowering, these drugs are as good or better than anything we have,"" said Koren, who presented data from the trial called Mendel-2 at the ACC meeting. In that 614-patient study, evolocumab reduced LDL 55-57 percent more than a placebo and up to 40 percent more than Merck & Co's cholesterol fighter Zetia in patients not on any other cholesterol drugs.It also helped about 70 percent of patients get their LDL down to 70 or lower, Koren said. That had been the target for high risk patients before controversial new guidelines announced last year eliminated specific target numbers.Amgen said it will file its application seeking U.S. approval of evolocumab sometime this year. The drug is expected to compete with similar medicines also in late stages of development from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc in partnership with Sanofi and from Pfizer. Analysts have forecast eventual annual sales of $3 billion or more for each of the drugs, assuming insurers agree to pay for them. Some industry analysts expect them to cost thousands of dollars a year, far above the costs of statins.The companies are conducting large, so-called outcomes studies to prove that the new medicines reduce heart attacks and strokes, as statins have, in addition to dramatically lowering LDL levels. The FDA has indicated that it would not necessarily wait for results from those years-long trials to approve the drugs.Earlier this month, the FDA asked companies developing PCSK9 inhibitors to assess potential cognitive impairment side effects that have been reported with some cholesterol drugs.""I can tell you in Medel-2 there was no (cognitive impairment) signal whatsoever,"" said Koren, chief executive of the Jacksonville Center for Clinical Research in Florida. Scott Wasserman, Amgen's executive medical director for global development, said the same has been true of other evolocumab studies.""We've looked at our data very, very carefully and are  continuing to look at it very carefully in combination with the FDA. We haven't seen any (neurocognitive) safety signals,"" Wasserman said in a telephone interview.In the study called Descartes, a 52-week trial of 901 patients already on statins or other lipid lowering medicines, evolocumab on average lowered LDL by 57 percent versus placebo.The 329-patient, 12-week Rutherford-2 study tested the Amgen drug in subjects with familial hypercholesterolemia, a genetic condition involving extreme, dangerously high cholesterol. For those patients, who were already on statins and other lipid lowering therapies, evolocumab took down LDL levels by 59-66 percent compared with placebo.Koren said he expects the first PCSK9 approvals to come for that patient population with additional approvals to follow for those who can't take statins.""It's really the most exciting story since statins, no question, and I think that's pretty universally held in the preventive cardiology community,"" Koren said.

34,"   By Deena Beasley  Pfizer Inc's experimental breast cancer drug in a clinical trial nearly doubled the amount of time patients lived without their disease getting worse, but overall survival was not yet shown to be statistically significant, researchers said.The Phase 2 study, which involved women with the most common form of breast cancer, found that those treated with hormone drug letrozole plus Pfizer's palbociclib lived for an average of 20.2 months before their cancer progressed, compared with 10.2 months for patients given letrozole alone.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has granted ""breakthrough"" status for palbociclib. Pfizer is still discussing a regulatory pathway for the drug and has not decided whether to seek accelerated approval based on Phase 2 trial results, said Mace Rothenberg, chief medical officer for Pfizer's oncology unit.Palbociclib is viewed as one of the company's most important experimental drugs that some analysts believe could eventually claim annual sales of more than $5 billion, if approved by regulators.The trial tested the pill, which targets proteins involved in cell division, in post-menopausal women with locally advanced or newly diagnosed breast cancer that had spread to other parts of the body. The women had cancer that was both estrogen receptor positive - meaning tumors grow in response to estrogen - and HER2-negative, meaning that the HER2 protein is not causing the cancer. Such patients make up about 60 percent of advanced breast cancer cases.The initial data showed overall survival of 37.5 months for the combination treatment, compared with 33.3 months for patients given just letrozole, an estrogen blocker sold by Novartis AG under the brand name Femara.Researchers said that because only about 30 patients in each arm of the 165-patient trial had died it was still too early to define the drug's impact on survival. ""The curves are starting to separate ... It hasn't reached statistical significance, but patients are still being followed,"" said Dr. Richard Finn, associate professor of medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles, and a lead author of the study.Side effects seen in the trial, including low blood cell counts and fatigue, were manageable, he said in a telephone interview ahead of the study's presentation on Sunday in San Diego at a meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research.Hormonal agents, like Femara, have extended survival for women with estrogen-positive, HER2 negative breast cancer, but there have been no big advances in treatment for nearly two decades, said Dr Judy Garber, a breast cancer specialist at Boston's Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and AACR representative not involved in the palbociclib trial.

38,"  * Senate Finance Committee Chairman Wyden calls for reform* Total of profits stashed abroad up 93 percent 2008-2013* GE tops list, followed by Microsoft, Pfizer, Merck, AppleBy Kevin Drawbaugh and Patrick Temple-WestWASHINGTON, April 8 Foreign profits held overseas by U.S. corporations to avoid taxes at home nearly doubled from 2008 to 2013 to top $2.1 trillion, said a private research firm's report, prompting a call for reform by the Senate's top tax law writer.""The new numbers ... certainly highlight what is one of the key challenges for tax reform. I do think there need to be some reforms in this area,"" Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden told reporters on Tuesday on Capitol Hill.Under U.S. law, corporations do not have to pay income tax on most of their overseas profits until they are brought into the United States. These earnings can be held offshore for years if they are classified as indefinitely invested abroad. Research firm Audit Analytics said in a report issued last week that the total of such earnings was up 93 percent from 2008 to 2013, citing federal financial filings for companies listed in the Russell 1000 index of U.S. corporations.Conglomerate General Electric Co had the biggest pile of earnings stored abroad, at $110 billion, the firm said.Next were software maker Microsoft Corp, with $76.4 billion; drugmakers Pfizer Inc, with $69 billion, and Merck & Co Inc, with $57.1 billion; and high-tech group Apple Inc, with $54.4 billion, it said.In response, GE said in a statement: ""GE operates in more than 170 countries, and most of these overseas earnings have been reinvested in active business operations like manufacturing facilities and loans to non-U.S. customers."" Microsoft, Merck and Pfizer were not immediately available for comment. Apple did not respond to requests for comment.BAUCUS AND WYDEN  Congress has quarreled for years over the law that lets multinationals stash profits abroad tax-free. Some favor killing the law - known as offshore corporate income tax deferral - and some back a one-time tax holiday that would let companies bring foreign profits home, or ""repatriate"" them, at a low tax rate.Debate over offshore deferral flared again in November when Wyden's predecessor as finance committee chairman, former Democratic Senator Max Baucus, proposed doing both. Baucus resigned weeks later to become U.S. ambassador to China.Wyden in the past has called for repeal of offshore deferral, along with a repatriation holiday, among other changes to the tax code, which he last month called ""a rotten carcass that the special interests feast on.""No decisive action is likely for now, however, with Congress deadlocked over fiscal issues at least until after the November mid-term congressional elections, according to policy analysts.Next year lawmakers are likely to mount another push to overhaul the tax code, a politically difficult feat that has not been pulled off since 1986, when Republican President Ronald Reagan and a divided Congress managed to get it done.The top U.S. corporate income tax rate is 35 percent, though few multinationals pay anywhere near that thanks to tax-reducing loopholes written into the code in the past 28 years, including some that have enabled wider use of offshore deferral.

39,"  * Gilead drug costs $84,000 for 12-week treatment* Insurers, WHO, congressmen critical of pricing* New drugs feature high cure rates, few side effectsBy Susan HeaveyWASHINGTON, April 10 The leading U.S. pharmaceutical industry trade group on Thursday defended the cost of Gilead Sciences Inc's new hepatitis C drug, Sovaldi, saying such treatments offer a priceless breakthrough for patients with the liver-destroying virus.""Their lives, in short, will be transformed,"" Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) President John Castellani said at the group's annual meeting in Washington. ""The value to these patients, and to their loved ones and society - you can't put a price tag on it.""Gilead's Sovaldi costs about $84,000 for a 12-week course of treatment, or $1,000 a day.That has drawn fire from health insurers, including state Medicaid programs, as well as U.S. lawmakers who are investigating Sovaldi's hefty price tag. This week, the World Health Organization joined the chorus of those seeking affordability for such drugs.While Gilead has said it is working to offer lower prices in dozens of developing countries, critics say such treatments should cost hundreds of dollars, rather than tens of thousands. Another treatment from Johnson & Johnson that some doctors have been combining with Sovaldi as other new medicines advance toward approval, costs about $66,000. Sovaldi, which was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration late last year, is well on track to post record-breaking sales in its first year on the market.Analysts with Capital Alpha have said 2014 sales of the drug could reach up to $15 billion, a figure that would top peak sales of Pfizer Inc's cholesterol fighter Lipitor, which had been the world's top-selling medicine before its patent protection lapsed.As many as 150 million people worldwide, including about 3.2 million in the United States, have hepatitis C, which is caused by contact with contaminated blood, often through shared needles by drug abusers or, prior to routine blood screening, from blood and organ transplants.Many people can carry the virus for decades before symptoms appear. But if untreated, it can cause serious liver damage and lead to cirrhosis, liver cancer, the need for a liver transplant or death. ""For the first time, 150 million people who are chronically infected with hepatitis C can be treated and cured of this terrible disease,"" Castellani said.He said debate over the price of new anti-viral drugs to treat the chronic condition, and the value they bring to patients, has gone ""askew,"" and warned that researching and developing them comes at a high cost to manufacturers.Defenders of the new medicines point out that older current multi-drug regimens cost at least as much, cure about 75 percent of patients, require 24 or 48 weeks of treatment and have miserable side effects that lead many to delay or discontinue treatment.The newer medicines being developed by several companies have demonstrated in clinical trials cure rates well in excess of 90 percent with minimal side effects and will require 12 weeks or fewer of treatment. Those companies, including AbbVie Inc, Merck & Co  and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co, are likely to be drawn into the pricing controversy as their new medicines edge  closer to approval amid fears that millions of patients will now come forward to seek treatment, causing a massive cost burden to insurers and governments.Merck and Bristol-Myers presented new hepatitis C data on Thursday at a major liver disease meeting in London  . Gilead, AbbVie and others will also present clinical trial data at the meeting.""Policy makers ... need to value innovation and stop implying that it comes cheap,"" Castellani said.Foster City, California-based Gilead, which paid $11 billion to acquire the company that had the rights to Sovaldi, has said it is working with government officials and others to help create a globally tiered pricing structure.That plan includes licensing the drug to three or four Indian generic manufacturers to allow sale of the medicine at lower prices in some 60 developing nations.Separately on Thursday, Indian generic drugmaker Natco Pharma Ltd called on the government to deny Sovaldi a patent in India, a source with knowledge of the matter said, potentially clearing the way to launch a much cheaper version of the drug.(Additional reporting by Bill Berkrot in New York; editing by Matthew Lewis)",2014-04-10,PFE,"Thu Apr 10, 2014 | 1:04pm EDT",U.S. drug industry group defends price of Gilead hepatitis drug,http://www.reuters.com//article/health-hepatitis-gilead-phrma-idUSL2N0N20YI20140410?type=companyNews
40,"  * AstraZeneca, Pfizer, UK charity link in multi-drug trial* Scope to test up to 14 drugs within same clinical study* Approach marks radical break with traditional trial design* Advances in genetic medicine allows remodelled trials* Could cut time and cost of bringing drugs to marketBy Ben HirschlerLONDON, April 17 Scientists and drugmakers are pioneering a new kind of clinical trial that changes the way cancer drugs are studied, potentially cutting both the time and cost of bringing them to market.Instead of testing one drug at a time, a novel lung cancer study announced on Thursday will allow British researchers to test up to 14 drugs from AstraZeneca and Pfizer  at the same time within one trial.The aim is to quickly pinpoint medicines that can fight advanced lung cancer by targeting specific rare genetic mutations - and it upends the normal approach of putting a particular drug at the centre of a study.Harpal Kumar, chief executive of charity Cancer Research UK, which is working on the 25-million-pound ($42-million) project with the two drugmakers, said the new approach would ""re-write the rule book on how we do clinical trials"". ""We are shifting the emphasis from designing a trial around a specific drug to designing it around selecting from a range of drugs for a specific patient,"" he told reporters.The National Lung Matrix trial, which is expected to open in July or August at centres across Britain, is part of a growing trend in cancer research to remodel the way new drugs are tested to keep up with the age of genomic medicine - fine-tuning treatments to the genetic profile of patients.The U.S. group Friends of Cancer Research said in November it was backing a similar multi-drug, multi-arm clinical trial to evaluate five experimental lung cancer drugs.Because any single gene mutation behind a particular cancer can be extremely rare, perhaps affecting as few as 1 or 2 percent of patients, studying one drug at a time is extremely challenging.The new trial offers a way around this by creating a protocol under which scientists can test patients' tumour samples for multiple gene faults and then assign them to an appropriate drug from among those in the trial for testing. NO RANDOMISATION Significantly, it does away with the idea of randomisation, where some patients are given a treatment and others get a ""control"" substance for comparison - traditionally the gold standard in drug testing.Increasingly, researchers are questioning whether such randomisation makes sense in patients with incurable cancer if a certain treatment is genetically bound to work much better in some people than others. Faster, smaller testing could shave years off the usual drug approval process. That also points to lower costs, although firms will be left with small markets from which to recoup investment.""It's premature to talk about pricing but it will make drug development more cost-effective,"" said Menelas Pangalos, AstraZeneca's head of innovative medicines.Mace Rothenberg, senior vice president at Pfizer Oncology, said: ""It should be a more efficient process but it is for a more niche, focused group of patients.""The new trial in non-small cell lung cancer will use up to 12 experimental drugs from AstraZeneca, including two compounds designed to boost the immune system that will be given to patients who do not show one of 21 sets of gene faults.Pfizer, meanwhile, is supplying Xalkori, which is approved for certain rare lung cancers and may also work in some even more unusual types, as well as the experimental drug palbociclib, which has shown promise in breast cancer.Around 15 to 20 patients will be given each drug initially  and promising medicines could be fast-tracked into larger-scale testing. Those that show no benefit will quickly be dropped.Kumar said new medicines could be added to the existing trial as science advances, and he hopes other drug companies will join the programme in due course.A successful programme in lung cancer could also lead to the concept being rolled out into testing drugs for other tumour types, he said.(Editing by Kate Kelland and Janet Lawrence)",2014-04-16,PFE,"Wed Apr 16, 2014 | 7:01pm EDT",New kind of trial aims to speed cancer drug development,http://www.reuters.com//article/health-cancer-trials-idUSL6N0N63N520140416?type=companyNews

Celebrex's basic chemical patent is set to expire this May.Pfizer said on Thursday it would continue to defend the patent extending its marketing exclusivity.""(The deal) helps them to get through 2014 with a lot less competition,"" Morningstar analyst Damien Conover said.""As soon as other generics get in, (Pfizer's) sales will erode even quicker.""

The deal settles Pfizer's patent infringement lawsuit against Teva.The U.S. drugmaker has also sued other generic drugmakers, including Mylan Inc and Actavis Inc, which are seeking U.S. regulatory approval to sell their own versions of Celebrex.Deals between patent holders and generic drug makers have come under increasing regulatory scrutiny because of their potential to delay the launch of cheaper medicines. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission is seeking a settlement of $1 billion or more from drugmakers, including AbbVie Inc , Actavis Plc and Teva, for settling patent-related lawsuits that allegedly end up making drugs more expensive.Celebrex, which is used to treat arthritis pain and inflammation, generated about $2.92 billion in sales in 2013, according to Pfizer's annual regulatory filing.""Under certain conditions, the license will be royalty-bearing, through the remaining term of the patent (Dec. 2, 2015),"" a Pfizer spokesman told Reuters in an email.The company declined to reveal other terms of the settlement.Teva's U.S.-listed shares were up 1 percent at $50.41 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, while Pfizer's shares were little changed at $30.24.

53,"   By Andrew Longstreth | NEW YORK, April 21  NEW YORK, April 21 Pfizer Inc has agreed to pay $190 million to settle a class-action lawsuit alleging the pharmaceutical company took steps to delay market entry of generic versions of its epilepsy drug Neurontin, according to court documents filed on Monday.Lawyers representing a class of Neurontin purchasers disclosed the terms of the settlement in a motion filed in New Jersey federal court seeking approval of the deal. The lawsuit, first filed in 2002, alleged that Pfizer took multiple steps to maintain its exclusivity on the sale of Neurontin, including sham patent infringement lawsuits and promotion of the drug for unapproved uses.Buyers of Neurontin claimed that Pfizer's activity forced them to pay inflated prices for the drug. Pfizer, which denied wrongdoing in the case, did not immediately return a message seeking comment. ""We're happy with the result after a long and hard litigation,"" said Robert Kaplan, one of the attorneys for the plaintiffs. In 2004, Pfizer agreed to pay $430 million to federal and state governments and pleaded guilty to criminal charges of illegally marketing Neurontin, a drug the company obtained with its 2000 acquisition of Warner Lambert Corp.The case is In re Neurontin Antitrust Litigation, No. 02-1390, U.S. District Court, District of New Jersey.

That would make Lilly's Elanco unit the world's second-largest animal health business when that deal closes early next year.A flurry of dealmaking has overtaken the global pharmaceutical industry recently as most large companies try to focus on a small number of leading businesses, while smaller specialty and generic producers seek greater scale.Deal values have almost doubled since the start of 2014 to $77.9 billion from a year earlier, according to Thomson Reuters data.The overhaul at Novartis marks the end of a yearlong review of its sprawling portfolio after the departure of longtime Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Daniel Vasella, the architect of the merger of Ciba-Geigy and Sandoz that led to the company's formation in 1996.The Swiss drugmaker said it would buy London-based GSK's oncology products for $14.5 billion plus another $1.5 billion that depends on the results of a trial in melanoma.The deal will strengthen Novartis's world No. 2 position in cancer behind crosstown rival Roche Holding AG. Novartis said GSK was buying its vaccines, excluding flu, for $5.25 billion plus potential milestone payments of up to $1.8 billion and ongoing royalties. The companies also will form a joint venture in consumer healthcare.The transactions, and their hint of more deals ahead for the drug sector, lifted the ARCA Pharmaceutials Index 1.8 percent.Lilly's Elanco animal health unit will acquire about 600 animal health brands from Novartis, including vaccines and anti-parasite medicines that will allow it to enter the acquaculture, or fish farming, market.This would be the eighth and largest acquisition since 2007 for Elanco, which by global sales would trail only Zoetis Inc , which also specializes in products for farm animals and pets.""With this transaction, we'll go from being No. 5 to No. 3 on the pet side globally and become a top 2 or 3 player in every segment"" of products for farm animals, Jeff Simmons, Lilly's head of animal health, said in an interview.Last year Elanco had sales of $2.15 billion, compared with $1.1 billion for Novartis Animal Health.""Novartis has agreed (to) an elegant set of transactions that either removes or strengthens its underperforming assets, while boosting its oncology portfolio,"" Jefferies analysts said. In afternoon New York Stock Exchange trading, Novartis shares were up 1.4 percent at $86.63, while GSK rose 4.2 percent to $55.34. Lilly dipped 0.9 percent to $60.32.FIGHTING FIT Novartis CEO Joe Jimenez said the revamp would help make the company ""fighting fit"" to meet the challenges of the global healthcare industry over the next 10 years.He told reporters the deals would lower overall sales by about $4 billion but result in higher profits as the company swaps lower-margin vaccines for higher-margin oncology drugs.Cancer is a particular focus for some drugmakers as novel medicines show promise by boosting the body's immune system. ""We reckon the real value of the (cancer) deal should be searched for in the pipeline and the newly launched products, strengthening Novartis' position in melanoma and hematology,"" Vontobel analyst Andrew Weiss said.Analysts at Swiss broker Notenstein were also upbeat, saying the new cancer drugs would help Novartis to navigate patent expiries on top-selling medicines more easily.However, analysts at Barclays described the price tag of as much as $16 billion for the oncology assets as ""rather hefty.""Drugmakers are stocking up their oncology pipelines as they bet that combinations of drugs will become the future of cancer care. A desire to boost its oncology business is seen as a key factor behind Pfizer's reported interest in AstraZeneca.Cancer is an extremely competitive marketplace, however, and some analysts said it was right for GSK to exit a field where it was only No. 14 in the world.GSK boss Andrew Witty said the company did not have the scale to compete in cancer drugs, so it made sense to put them into ""the hands of somebody who is a world leader in oncology.""Conversely, he said the deals with Novartis strengthened two of GSK's core businesses: vaccines, given in more than 2 million shots every day, and consumer health, where the company will take the lead in running a business worth about $10 billion in annual revenue with the Swiss group.The deals were another step in his strategy of focusing on areas of strength, he said, moving further away from the monolithic model of drugs companies that tried to do everything.After the deal, GSK will get 70 percent of sales from its franchises in respiratory, HIV, vaccines and consumer health.Novartis said it would start a separate sale process for its flu business immediately, which was not part of the GSK deal.Lilly said it would fund its animal health transaction with $3.4 billion of cash and $2 billion of loans, and it expected cost savings of about $200 million per year within three years of closing the deal.Bank of America Merrill Lynch advised Lilly, while Goldman Sachs Group Inc advised Novartis on the animal health deal. GSK said Lazard and Zaoui & Co were its joint financial advisers.($1 = 0.5951 British Pounds)   (Additional reporting by Alice Baghdjian, Ben Hirschler, Anjuli Davies, Ransdell Pierson and PJ Huffstutter.

58,"   By Rod Nickel  At any given time, the acquisitive chief executive of Valeant Pharmaceuticals Inc is brokering multiple deal discussions and eyeing as many as 50 buying opportunities.It's not the usual way of doing business in the drug sector, where research and development is often considered a company's lifeblood. But then there is little that's typical about Michael Pearson's approach to business.Pearson's latest target, with help from activist investor Bill Ackman, is Allergan Inc, maker of anti-wrinkle treatment Botox. Valeant and Ackman's Pershing Square Capital Management launched an unsolicited $47 billion bid on Tuesday to buy the company.The deal is another bold step in a strategy Pearson put into motion soon after leaving McKinsey & Co, where he spent 23 years advising companies - including Valeant - on turnarounds, acquisitions and strategy. Within the pharmaceuticals industry, that makes him a consummate outsider, a Canadian-born CEO with the eye of a strategic management consultant.Named Valeant's chief executive in 2008, Pearson started snapping up dermatology products such as sunscreen and anti-aging items in a plan with aggressive revenue growth targets. In 2010, Canada's Biovail Corp and U.S.-based Valeant merged, with the combined company assuming the Valeant name, the Canadian head office, and keeping Pearson as CEO.""What he has done so far is quite brilliant,"" said Gautam Dhingra, chief executive of High Pointe Capital Management, a Valeant shareholder. ""Mike Pearson, coming in as an outsider who didn't grow up in the pharma industry, although he consulted in the pharma industry, perhaps he was able to take a more objective and calculating look.""Pearson tapped Howard Schiller, a former chief operating officer of the investment banking division at Goldman Sachs, to be his chief financial officer in 2011, a move that has helped Valeant's acquisitive strategy.The plan that has so impressed Dhingra rests on three pillars, he says:* Cut spending on research and development;* Spend instead on acquisitions with proven products that will add to earnings, and cut expenses;* And domicile intellectual properties in tax havens such as Barbados, using Valeant's Canadian head office and looser laws on taxing repatriated profits. ""You combine those three ideas, and it's a powerful combination,"" Dhingra said. Traditionally, he said, ""a company's status is determined to some extent by coming up with a new, big drug. It's possible others have a hard time changing that mindset.""It doesn't hurt investor confidence that Valeant has consistently been a top stock performer, climbing more than 80 percent in the last year alone.Pearson grew up in a family of modest means in London, Ontario, the son of a phone installer who sacrificed to send his son to prestigious Duke University in North Carolina, according to a feature last year in the Globe and Mail.Early on, Pearson revealed himself as someone who was willing to work hard to achieve. As a youth, he joined the Boy Scouts and rose to Eagle Scout, the organization's highest rank.The hard work has carried over into the head office, where Pearson favors a lean, decentralized approach that allows local managers to run their geographical areas.The approach includes Pearson and Schiller wringing millions or hundreds of millions in cost savings out of their acquisitions, often more than expected. Pearson joked about his parsimonious style at a meeting with about 200 investors and analysts on Tuesday in a New York office building, an unusually grandiose setting for Valeant.""We still care about every penny,"" Pearson told the audience.

Pearson, Ackman said, made him pay for his own burrito at a recent meeting when the activist investor requested it instead of food already provided.Cost cuts at Allergan would focus on ""people sitting in offices,"" not staff who deal with customers, Pearson said.CAUTION IN SOME QUARTERS Pearson's unusual approach doesn't have universal support.""One of the reasons we have not participated in the name has been because of certain issues as it pertains to aggressive accounting policies and the speed of their acquisitions,"" said John Goldsmith, vice-president of Montrusco Bolton Investments, which holds some Valeant shares on behalf of clients. Valeant supplements its results and guidance with a measure called cash earnings per share, an adjusted measure not in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.For a CEO, Pearson is an unpolished public speaker. Still, he has carried out dozens of deals in his six years at the helm of Valeant, ranging from the obscure to bigger names such as Bausch + Lomb, Medicis Pharmaceutical Corp and Obagi Medical Products. Revenue has grown nearly eight-fold to $5.8 billion last year.Pearson has not hit a home run every time he has targeted a company. He held talks last year with generic drugmaker Actavis Plc about a combination that didn't lead to a deal, and as recently as January he was eyeing Pfizer Inc's branded generics business, according to sources.There may appear to be little strategy involved in targets that include such disparate products as contact lenses, prescription drugs and acne treatments. But Pearson has been clear about favoring segments where patients often pay out of pocket, such as ophthalmology and dermatology, cutting Valeant's exposure to cost-sensitive insurers.He also likes spending to buy proven drugs already on the market, preferably with no expiring patents in the near term, to the unknowns of research and development departments.""He's made the company really justify their R&D spending,"" said Morningstar analyst David Krempa in an interview.The longer-term risk of cutting work on a new pipeline of products is weaker organic growth prospects and an unhealthy reliance on a steady diet of new deal opportunities.Pearson sees no shortage of those and this year upped the ante, promising to vault Valeant from among the world's 15 biggest pharmaceutical companies by market cap to the top five. Swallowing Allergan would double Valeant's market cap to around $84 billion, based on Monday's close, pushing the company past the halfway point to its $150 billion goal by the end of 2016.The pace of acquisitions and the goal of more than tripling Valeant's market cap concern Krempa, who otherwise holds a positive view of Valeant and Pearson.""We'd rather just see him focus on maximizing the return on investment rather than focusing on just getting big to get big,"" he said.

Drugmaker AstraZeneca rose 4.7 percent, with trading volumes in the stock more than three times its 90-day average, after the Sunday Times reported a 60-billion-pound ($101 billion) approach from U.S. peer Pfizer.      Both companies declined to comment. Analysts at Citigroup said in a research note they expected Pfizer ""to push aggressively ahead with a second approach"", referring to the reported rejection of the offer. Pfizer stock rose 1 percent.     GlaxoSmithKline rose 5.2 percent after an asset-swap with Swiss peer Novartis, which announced a multi-billion dollar revamp. Shire rose 7.6 percent on hopes that sectoral takeover activity would spread.       ""M&A activity shows a certain confidence on the part of the executives of the companies. The AstraZeneca would be one of the biggest deals ever done for a London-listed company,"" Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets, said.     ""It's true to say that when deals like this come off, more follow suit.

The FTSE 100 hit a peak of 6,867 points in late January, its highest level since early 2000 and is now less than 3 percent below that level, having recovered from a slide driven by concern over a slump in emerging markets economies and tension between Russia and Western powers over Ukraine.     However, it has been stuck in a 200-point range for the last six weeks. Tuesday's move took the index to the top end of that range, but analysts were cautious.     ""We're still in quite a wide range, and there hasn't been too much outside of the pharma sector to make us think that we'll break out of it soon,"" Jeremy Batstone-Carr, analyst at Charles Stanley, said.

The index finished below its intraday high - its highest since April 4, and technical analysts said it was too early to tell whether the challenge to the resistance area could be sustained and if the index would break out of the range.     ""The FTSE 100 cash index is posting a rebound but is challenging the upper end of the short term trading range at 6,706,"" Trading Central technical analyst Nicolas Suiffet said.

63,"  LONDON, April 22 Shares in European drugmakers received a shot in the arm on Tuesday amid a flurry of activity, with Novartis striking a multi-billion dollar deal with GlaxoSmithKline and reports U.S. giant Pfizer had approached Britain's AstraZeneca over a deal.Pfizer and AstraZeneca declined to comment on a Sunday Times report of a possible $100 billion deal, but the potential bid fueled speculation the sector was ripe for consolidation as drugmakers build scale in specialized areas where they can find growth.The European healthcare sector index was up 2.8 percent at 0927 GMT, led by AstraZeneca, up 6.5 percent at 4,030 pence, and GSK, up 5.4 percent at 1,643 pence.Shares in Britain's Hikma Pharmaceuticals and BTG also rose more than 4 percent, while Shire, a perennial subject of takeover speculation, was up 4.6 percent.Analysts also pointed to Belgium's UCB SA, up 3.1 percent, and Switzerland's Actelion, 1.5 percent stronger, as potential targets for a larger rival. Citi said the ""usual suspects were likely to return to focus"", noting that previously cited potential targets in Europe included Shire, Actelion and UCB, based on either promising pipelines or significant cost and tax synergies.""We expect renewed interest in the use of offshore cash held by US companies to fund ex-US M&A,"" the analysts said in a briefing note. The Sunday Times cited sources saying informal conversations had taken place between Pfizer and AstraZeneca but the British company resisted the approach.A big driver behind Pfizer's interest is drugs to treat cancer, including promising experimental medicines in AstraZeneca's pipeline know as immunotherapies, analysts said. Novartis is also strengthening its oncology portfolio with the GlaxoSmithKline deal, an area in which GSK said it ranked outside the global top 10.The Swiss drugmaker is paying $14.5 billion for GSK's oncology business and is also divesting its vaccines business to GSK for $7.1 billion plus royalties.In a separate transaction, Novartis said it had agreed to divest its animal health division to Eli Lilly for about $5.4 billion.Novartis shares rose 2.5 percent in morning trade to 76.5 euros.

""These numbers highlight why the interest (from Pfizer) is there.

68,"   By Kevin Drawbaugh  A wave of tax-driven overseas deal-making by U.S. companies gained momentum with drugmaker Pfizer Inc's (PFE.N) announcement on Monday that it had made takeover bids for UK rival AstraZeneca Plc (AZN.L), fueling political concerns about tax ""reflagging"" strategies.Pfizer said it wants to buy AstraZeneca and merge the two companies into a UK holding company with a UK tax domicile, while maintaining its operational headquarters in New York. It would likely be the largest deal ever done that included such a so-called tax ""inversion.""If a deal goes through - which is far from certain given AstraZeneca has so far rejected Pfizer's overtures - it would likely mean a loss of corporate tax revenue for the United States, and a lower effective tax rate for the combined entity than the two companies pay now.For 2013, Pfizer disclosed an effective rate of 27.5 percent and global cash income tax paid of $2.87 billion, including income taxes paid to the U.S. government and other state and foreign tax authorities, based on company filings.The Pfizer proposal triggered concern in Washington. ""This further demonstrates the urgency for tax reform,"" said a spokeswoman for Democratic Senator Ron Wyden, chairman of the tax-writing U.S. Senate Finance Committee.""Now is the time to undertake comprehensive reform to ensure our country stays competitive on a global stage and continues to be the best place for corporate investment,"" the spokeswoman said.Governments worldwide are increasingly wary of corporate tax avoidance. The Obama administration earlier this year included a proposal in its 2015 budget to clamp down on deals like the one Pfizer is pursuing. The administration's proposal is unlikely to go anywhere though with Congress deadlocked on tax issues.The U.S. Internal Revenue Service on Friday issued a separate notice limiting shareholders' tax-free treatment in inversion transactions.TAX-DRIVEN DEALS RAMP UP Since the 2008 global financial crisis, about two dozen U.S. companies have shifted their legal tax residences to lower-tax countries via corporate deals, versus about the same number over the previous 25 years, a Reuters review of transactions showed.Ireland, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Canada and Britain lately have been the most common destinations of U.S. companies seeking new tax domiciles, replacing preferred havens of years past such as Bermuda and the Cayman Islands. Buying AstraZeneca would allow Pfizer to escape the comparatively high 35-percent U.S. corporate income tax rate.The United States has one of the highest such tax rates in the world, though most multinational companies pay less than that due to plentiful loopholes.Pfizer spokeswoman Joan Campion said the UK holding company structure being contemplated ""provides for a more efficient tax structure that doesn't subject AstraZeneca's non-U.S. profits to U.S. tax."" Campion declined further comment.Inversions allow U.S. corporations to escape that high rate by moving to a lower-tax country, via an acquisition, a merger or the creation of a new holding company. They can also reduce overall U.S. profits in a process known as ""earnings stripping"" that involves loading up the legacy U.S. business with tax-deductible debt, said academics and private tax watchdog groups.The AstraZeneca transaction would also give Pfizer a way to spend some of an estimated $69 billion it is holding abroad under a law that lets U.S. companies shelter overseas earnings from U.S. taxes by keeping them out of the United States.OMNICOM-PUBLICIS DEAL  Another large inversion deal is New York advertising firm Omnicom Group Inc's (OMC.N) proposed $35-billion merger with Paris rival Publicis Groupe SA <PUBP.PA). This transaction is encountering approval delays among European tax authorities.Omnicom and Publicis announced in mid-2013 they planned to merge into a new corporate holding company to be based in the Netherlands, with operating units staying in New York and Paris.The merger was described then as tax-free to shareholders of both companies, with each side getting about 50 percent of the shares in the new Dutch holding company. The deal was then expected to close in late 2013 or early 2014.Last week, Omnicom said Dutch and UK tax authorities had not yet approved the deal, which Omnicom had previously said would save $80 million a year in taxes. A plan to make the company tax resident in the UK while being domiciled in the Netherlands had become a particular stumbling block.Omnicom-Publicis is more like a merger of equals than it is an inversion, but ""the practical impact of this transaction is that the company is achieving a corporate inversion,"" said Bret Wells, a professor at the University of Houston Law Center who has studied corporate inversions for years.Though the Obama budget proposal is unlikely to become law anytime soon, it does indicate that the U.S. government is trying to grapple with the question of inversions. ""It's been a decade since the first inversion legislation was enacted and Obama is now trying to tighten the rules,"" said Steven Rosenthal, a tax expert and senior fellow at the Urban Institute, a policy think tank in Washington, D.C.""There's a lot of concern about losing U.S. companies to these reflagging operations,"" he said.IRS TAKES STEP The IRS's move last week ""further evidences the government's narrow reading of the inversion rules and dovetails with the Obama administration's 2015 budget proposal to narrow the scope of permitted inversions,"" said international law firm Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft LLP in an emailed update to clients on tax-related merger and acquisition developments.""More companies are currently considering inversions by merger, including mergers involving two or more foreign jurisdictions,"" said Linda Swartz, chair of Cadwalader's tax group. ""Companies have become more comfortable with the prospect of inverting as the number of announced deals has steadily increased this year.""The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, a Paris-based club of major industrial economies, is studying tax base erosion and the related issue of profit shifting by multinational corporations among units in different countries.The United States was among members of the G20 nations that endorsed the OECD project. ""Profits should be taxed where economic activities deriving the profits are performed and where value is created,"" said a declaration of the G20 leaders in September after a summit meeting in St. Petersburg, Russia.The IRS has addressed inversions, which are generally thought to have first emerged in 1982, by trying to define what is and is not a foreign business, and by trying to curb opportunities for earnings stripping, but with little success.A flurry of deals from 1997 through 2002 saw several major U.S. companies reflag in Bermuda and the Cayman Islands. Congress cracked down with a stricter law in 2004 and the flow of deals dried up for a few years.The latest wave of deals got under way in 2008 after the financial crisis abated. The wave has continued amid inconclusive IRS efforts to define how much presence a corporation must have in the United States and abroad to be treated as a foreign company for U.S. tax purposes.(Additional reporting by Tom Bergin and Ben Hirschler in London; Nicola Leske, Olivia Oran, Nadia Damouni, Leila Abboud and Ransdell Pierson in New York; Editing by Martin Howell)",2014-04-28,PFE,"Mon Apr 28, 2014 | 7:02pm EDT",Pfizer move to join tax-driven deal-making raises red flags in U.S,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-usa-tax-pfizer-analysis-idUSBREA3R1FL20140428?type=companyNews
69,"  (Adds details of legal challenge, background)April 28 Actavis Plc said on Monday it has sued the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, challenging its decision to award exclusive rights to Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd to sell a generic version of Pfizer Inc's blockbuster painkiller Celebrex.A similar lawsuit was announced Friday by Mylan Inc  over generic drug marketing exclusivity for Celebrex. Actavis alleges that FDA improperly awarded sole exclusivity to Teva despite an earlier ruling from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit that resulted in the expiration of that entitlement. Teva, the world's largest generic drugmaker, earlier this month signed a deal that would allow it to launch a generic version of Celebrex in December. Celebrex's basic chemical patent is set to expire this May. Deals between patent holders and generic drugmakers have come under increased regulatory scrutiny because of their potential to delay the launch of cheaper medicines.Celebrex, which is used to treat arthritis pain and inflammation, generated about $2.92 billion in sales in 2013, according to Pfizer's annual regulatory filing.

71,"   By Ben Hirschler and Ransdell Pierson | LONDON/NEW YORK  LONDON/NEW YORK U.S. drugmaker Pfizer Inc approached Britain's AstraZeneca Plc two days ago to reignite a potential $100 billion takeover and was rebuffed, raising investor expectations it will have to increase its offer to close the deal.Pfizer said on Monday it proposed a takeover to AstraZeneca in January worth 58.8 billion pounds ($98.9 billion), or nearly 47 pounds per share. It had contacted its British rival again on Saturday, seeking to discuss further a takeover.The chase was welcomed by investors in both companies, as deal-making grips the healthcare industry. AstraZeneca shares were up 11.7 percent at $76.69 in New York on news of the latest offer, which would be the biggest foreign acquisition of a British company and one of the largest pharmaceutical deals. Pfizer shares were up 3.8 percent at $31.92 on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday afternoon.AstraZeneca said Pfizer's suggested offer undervalued the company ""very significantly,"" adding that Pfizer wanted to pay 70 percent in shares and only 30 percent in cash. AstraZeneca urged its shareholders to take no action and said it remained confident of its independent strategy.""I feel pretty confident of a higher bid coming,"" said Neil Veitch, global and UK investment director at SVM Asset Management, which owns AstraZeneca shares. ""I think it's more likely than not that we'll see an agreed deal somewhere in that 52 to 53 pound range.""Buying AstraZeneca would boost Pfizer's pipeline of cancer drugs and create significant cost and tax savings. Under British takeover rules, Pfizer has until May 26 to announce a firm intention to make an offer or back away.The renewed approach comes amid a wave of mergers and acquisitions in the sector, pushing the value of deals to $153 billion so far this year, as the industry restructures amid healthcare spending cuts and competition from cheap generics.""Society wants products faster, they want more products and they want value,"" Pfizer Chief Executive Ian Read told reporters. ""Industry is responding to society's request for increased efficiencies and productivity.""Read said AstraZeneca had declined to engage in talks and the U.S. group was now considering how to proceed, but he remained convinced that combining the two companies made strategic sense and would benefit AstraZeneca investors.NEW DRUG PIPELINES Pfizer's original proposal, made to the board of AstraZeneca on January 5, would have valued AstraZeneca shares at 46.61 pounds each - a premium of around 30 percent at the time.AstraZeneca said the proposal comprised 13.98 pounds in cash and 1.758 Pfizer shares for each AstraZeneca share. ""My guess is it will go for somewhere between 50 and 55 (pounds a share),"" said Dan Mahony, a fund manager at Polar Capital, who raised his stake in AstraZeneca in February last year. ""I doubt Pfizer will want to go completely hostile.""Most of Pfizer's past deals have been conducted on a friendly basis, including its 2009 purchase of Wyeth for $68 billion. But it has been willing to play hardball if needed, as it did in 2000 with its $90 billion purchase of U.S. rival Warner-Lambert, with which it won full ownership of cholesterol fighter Lipitor, the best-selling drug of all time.Read told U.S. analysts that since the initial approach to AstraZeneca, both companies had seen experimental drugs fare well in trials. At the same time, Pfizer concluded it was too difficult to pursue big deals domestically while being on the hook for higher U.S. tax rates.""We're coming from a position of strength, on our near-term pipeline"" of experimental drugs, Read said.Recent favorable data includes results for Pfizer's experimental breast cancer medicine palbociclib.INDEPENDENT FUTURE  Pfizer's declaration turns up the heat under AstraZeneca Chief Executive Pascal Soriot, who has been in the job since October 2012 and who made clear last week he saw an independent future for the group, flagging spin-offs of two noncore units as one option to create more value.Soriot has been credited with reviving AstraZeneca's previously thin pipeline of new drugs, badly needed to offset a wave of patent expiries on older drugs, and shares in the group have now risen more than 60 percent under his tenure.However, his overhaul - including an ambitious plan to move the company's research and corporate headquarters to Cambridge, England - is still a work in progress and he has also come under fire from some shareholders over executive pay.Read said it was premature to say who would lead a combined company.Buying AstraZeneca would give Pfizer a number of promising - though still risky - experimental cancer medicines known as immunotherapies that boost the body's immune system to fight tumors. It could also generate significant cost savings for the U.S. group.Acquiring a foreign company also makes sense for Pfizer as it has tens of billions of dollars accumulated through foreign subsidiaries, which, if repatriated, would be heavily taxed. The drugmaker has more recently been divesting certain operations, while mega-mergers had fallen out of fashion in the pharmaceuticals industry following skepticism about how well some of them have worked.HEFTY RETURN But CEO Read said large deals could also make good sense and buying AstraZeneca would ""maintain the flexibility for the potential future separation of our businesses.""The transaction would complement both Pfizer's innovative drug businesses and also its established products business - comprising older and off-patent medicines - which many analysts expect to be eventually spun off.In addition to using offshore cash, buying AstraZeneca would be tax-efficient since Pfizer could redomicile to Britain and enjoy lower tax rates, thanks to attractive incentives to companies that manufacture and hold patents in the country.Pfizer envisages combining the two drugmakers under a new UK-incorporated holding company, although the head office and stock market listing would remain in New York. But the suggested deal has triggered worries about jobs in Britain's drug sector, viewed as a key industry by the government.AstraZeneca has already laid off thousands of staff as it shrinks its cost base to cope with a fall in sales due to patent losses on blockbuster medicines, while Pfizer has shuttered a research site in Sandwich, southern England.Read said Pfizer had contacted the British government about its plans on Monday, after Finance Minister George Osborne said on Friday that any deal was ""a commercial matter between the companies"".A spokesman for Prime Minister David Cameron told reporters on Monday that any Pfizer takeover bid would be assessed by ""independent procedures and frameworks.""Bank of America Merrill Lynch, JP Morgan and Guggenheim Securities are advising Pfizer, while Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Evercore Partners are working for AstraZeneca.(Additional reporting by Ransdell Pierson in New York and Simon Jessop in London; editing by Mark Potter, David Holmes, Bernadette Baum and Matthew Lewis)",2014-04-28,PFE,"Mon Apr 28, 2014 | 5:28pm EDT",Pfizer chases AstraZeneca for potential $100 billion deal,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-astrazeneca-pfizer-idUSBREA3R0H520140428?type=companyNews

The transaction would amass scale  for Pfizer, broaden the company's portfolio and pipeline and could provide some  tax advantages.Pfizer, which is headquartered in New York, Monday confirmed it had approached  London-based AZ in January 2014 regarding a possible merger, and again this  month. AZ confirmed discussions with Pfizer but said there was no specific offer  to acquire the company. Pfizer contends a completed transaction would combine  highly complementary innovative and established pharmaceutical businesses,  enhancing its ability to meet patients' needs. Pfizer's interest in AZ represents a possible return to mega-deals not seen  since the last decade. Recent consolidation in the pharmaceutical industry has  been more targeted in nature. An AZ buy would broaden Pfizer's portfolio and  pipeline, just as when the company acquired Wyeth in October of 2009. The AZ  acquisition would cost Pfizer approximately $99 billion (compared to $68 billion  for Wyeth), and underscores Pfizer's experience with larger acquisitions. Pfizer's January proposal to the board of AZ included a combination of cash and  shares in the combined entity which represented an indicative value of $76.62  per AZ share and a premium of approximately 30%. Pfizer said in a statement that  it is considering its options with respect to AZ.Importantly, a company of Pfizer's size with approximately $70 billion of cash  tied up abroad would likely consider acquisition alternatives that are  accompanied by some sort of tax advantage. A completed Pfizer/AZ transaction  would likely result in a new U.K.-incorporated holding company, according to  Pfizer, and would translate to a lower tax rate than in the US. An AZ acquisition would likely have a negative to neutral effect on Pfizer's  credit profile. However, the potential impact remains unclear until more  specific transaction details become available. Fitch affirmed Pfizer's Issuer  Default Rating (IDR) at 'A+' on April 4. The Rating Outlook is Stable.We anticipate Pfizer will continue to generate strong free cash flow and  maintain solid liquidity during the intermediate term, with significant  international cash balances and adequate access to the credit markets. Fitch  believes Pfizer will continue to aggressively deploy cash toward acquisitions  and share repurchases.",2014-04-29,PFE,"Tue Apr 29, 2014 | 9:12am EDT","RPT-Fitch: Pfizer, AstraZeneca Combo Would Achieve Strategic Aims",http://www.reuters.com//article/fitch-pfizer-astrazeneca-combo-would-ach-idUSFit69871320140429?type=companyNews

""If they had enough in their own pipeline, they wouldn't need to buy a big company; they'd be doing smaller collaborations.""Liss still believes the deal makes sense because it could create $4 billion in annual cost-savings for Pfizer, knock down its tax rate by rebasing the biggest U.S. drugmaker to Britain, and bring Pfizer potentially lucrative cancer drugs from AstraZeneca that work by stimulating the immune system.""Pfizer's problem is they have a very thin drug pipeline,"" said John Boris, an analyst with Suntrust Robinson Humphrey. ""And this is a very clear admission of that,"" he said, referring to Pfizer's two rebuffed efforts since January to buy AstraZeneca.Read appeared to head off the criticism on Monday in discussing his efforts to reignite talks with Astra. He told investors that Pfizer had redoubled its efforts to buy AstraZeneca after favorable data from trials of new and experimental company drugs allowed it to act from ""a position of strength.""But industry watchers questioned that description. Pfizer had hoped to turn a corner on its research when it won regulatory approvals over the past three years for kidney cancer treatment Inlyta and Xalkori for lung cancer after a decade without any significant new drugs. But both have seen weak sales. Two newer treatments that had been deemed potential blockbusters with billions of dollars in sales, Xeljanz for rheumatoid arthritis and Eliquis to prevent blood clots that can cause strokes, have failed to take flight.Experimental breast cancer drug palbociclib, which has been deemed Pfizer's most exciting product in development, is now expected to face stiff competition from more effective and safer drugs in the same class being developed by rivals, Boris said.HOLES IN THE PIPELINE Pfizer has chased down and swallowed three other major drugmakers in the past 15 years, beginning with its hostile acquisition of Warner Lambert. The deal gave it full ownership of cholesterol fighter Lipitor, which went on to become the world's biggest medicine, and created opportunity for deep cost cuts that propped up earnings for several years. But Pfizer's profits were on the downswing by 2003, after the company failed to come up with new products to replace aging blockbusters. So Pfizer spent $60 billion that year to acquire Pharmacia Corp, counting on thousands of job cuts and other cost savings to get its earnings growing again.When Pfizer's laboratories remained unproductive, and the company was faced with impending generic competition for Lipitor, Pfizer paid $68 billion in 2009 for Wyeth.Morningstar analyst Damien Conover said Pfizer is not facing impending patent expirations on big medicines, with the exception of painkiller Celebrex, so is not desperate for a merger as it was with the Wyeth deal.But Conover said Pfizer needs cost cuts because it will likely generate average annual earnings growth of only 2 percent over the next five years with its existing products, half the average likely growth for other large drugmakers. ""They have a few potential blockbusters, but not of the magnitude of Merck (MRK.N) or Bristol-Myers (BMY.N),"" Conover said, which have strong immuno-oncology programs.

87,"  * Lawmakers want to protect research and jobs in UK* Planned $100 bln bid would be biggest ever of a UK firm* Pfizer unable to commit on jobs or investment   (Adds FT report on David Cameron's representatives in talks)By Kylie MacLellan and Ben HirschlerLONDON, April 30 British lawmakers intend to investigate U.S. drugmaker Pfizer's planned $100 billion takeover of British rival AstraZeneca in a bid to ensure scientific research and jobs are protected.Members of the parliamentary business, innovation and skills committee are worried that the deal, which would be the biggest-ever foreign acquisition of a British company, could threaten the country's strategic interests.""We are keen to look closely at it,"" committee member Ann McKechin told Reuters. ""We will see how events pan out over the next few days, but clearly given the scale of the proposed merger it is important that we consider the impact not just on shareholders but also on employees and the wider interests of the UK.""AstraZeneca, Britain's second-biggest drugmaker behind GlaxoSmithKline, is an important part of the life sciences sector and employs nearly 7,000 staff in the country.The committee's chairman Andrew Bailey said it would be looking to hold an inquiry ""pretty quickly"", and those called to give evidence were likely to include ministers such as Business Secretary Vince Cable and representatives from the Treasury.The British government has so far adopted a neutral stance on the matter, with finance minister George Osborne saying any deal between the two companies would be a commercial matter. ""The line that this is a straightforward commercial issue that the government has no role in is too laid back,"" said Bailey. ""In AstraZeneca we have a company that amounts to 2.3 percent of our total exports, is a world leader in research in pharmaceuticals and is very strategically positioned in this country.""Committee member Katy Clark said Pfizer's management would also probably be among those called to any inquiry.The Financial Times, citing a senior Whitehall official, reported late on Wednesday that Prime Minister David Cameron had appointed two of his most senior officials to lead government negotiations with Pfizer on his behalf. (link.reuters.com/cuc98v) Politicians are wary of foreign takeovers in the light of Kraft's 2010 acquisition of Cadbury, when the U.S. food group promised to keep open a key factory, only to go back on the pledge soon after the deal was completed.""The committee previously had a great deal of concern over the Cadbury takeover, so I think this is one we will really have to closely analyse what is on offer,"" McKechin said.Pfizer already has a tarnished reputation in Britain after it announced plans in 2011 to shut a major drug research site in Sandwich, southern England, where Viagra was invented, with the loss of nearly 2,000 jobs.The U.S. firm says it views Britain as an attractive location for both pharmaceutical research and manufacturing - helped by recent government tax incentives - but cannot make any firm commitments on future investment or jobs.Pfizer Chief Executive Ian Read is in Britain to lobby politicians and investors about the company's plans. Despite the government's neutral stance, behind the scenes officials are warning Pfizer against making draconian research job cuts, industry sources said.Pfizer has made two approaches to AstraZeneca, both of which have been rebuffed. The company is widely expected to come back with a revised offer before a May 26 deadline for it to ""put up or shut up"" under UK takeover rules.

The regulatory filing said Express Scripts received a subpoena on Feb. 27 from the U.S. Department of Justice, District of Rhode Island. It requested information on the company's contractual arrangements with Pfizer Inc, Bayer AG, Biogen Idec Inc and EMD Serono Inc, a unit of Germany's Merck KGaA, concerning multiple sclerosis drugs Betaseron, Rebif and Avonex.A subpoena received on March 31 from the Attorney General of New Jersey sought information regarding arrangements made by Express Scripts and Medco - a leading PBM that Express Scripts bought in 2012 - with British drugmaker AstraZeneca Plc  concerning heartburn drug Nexium. The third subpoena came April 8 from the U.S. Department of Labor, and asked for information regarding Express Scripts' and Medco's client relationships from 2009 until present, Express Scripts said in the filing.Express Scripts late on Tuesday posted a lower-than-expected first-quarter profit and decreased its earnings forecast for full-year 2014, saying adjusted prescription volume would be less than it had anticipated.Results were hurt by severe winter weather in the quarter as well as later-than-expected enrollment in public health insurance exchanges under the Affordable Care Act, the company said.(Reporting by Ransdell Pierson; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)",2014-04-30,PFE,"Wed Apr 30, 2014 | 1:10pm EDT",Express Scripts says significance of subpoenas still unclear,http://www.reuters.com//article/express-scr-subpoenas-idUSL2N0NM1L620140430?type=companyNews

101,"   By Olivia Oran and Soyoung Kim | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Rumors about a massive healthcare deal were circulating in industry circles, months before Pfizer Inc disclosed its $100 billion pursuit of Britain's AstraZeneca Plc, according to several industry bankers and lawyers.As rivals and bankers assessed what it could mean for different companies in the industry, one aspect touched nearly everyone: what it could mean for an increasingly popular U.S. tax loophole.U.S. healthcare companies worried that if a household name like Pfizer changed its domicile to Britain to lower its tax rate as a result of a deal with AstraZeneca, it would spur Congress into action and close the tax arbitrage opportunity, called tax inversion, for everyone else, these people said.The fear of such an outcome - even though it is likely many months, if not years, away - added new urgency to companies such as Botox-maker Allergan Inc and generic drugmaker Mylan Inc that were already looking at European targets, people familiar with these situations said.Allergan declined to comment. Its CEO David Pyott has said that he would be uncomfortable doing a deal where the tax benefit, and not strategy, was the principal driver. Mylan could not be immediately reached for comment.Now that Pfizer's plans are out in the open, pitching by bankers on inversion targets has reached a fever pitch. While tax arbitrage deals have so far largely been in the pharmaceutical sector, bankers and lawyers said U.S. technology, consumer and industrial companies are also now looking into the possibility of doing a tax inversion deal.One banker, who declined to be identified because he is actively advising companies on such deals, said the Pfizer plan ""will get people to try to move a lot quicker"" so that they can get a deal ""grandfathered in"" before any possible law change.WASHINGTON WORRIES Tax inversions allow U.S. companies, which face one of the highest tax rates in the world - a federal tax rate of 35 percent, and an overall rate that can be close to 40 percent including state and local taxes - to move to a lower-tax country by buying or creating a new holding company. Since 2008, about two dozen U.S. companies have used the strategy, versus about the same number over the previous 25 years, according to a Reuters review of transactions.Ireland, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Canada and Britain lately have been the most common destinations of U.S. companies seeking new tax domiciles. The U.K. tax rate for companies is due to drop to 20 percent from 21 percent next year.This year, most of those deals have happened in healthcare, which is in the midst of an unprecedented bout of deal-making. More than $153 billion worth of deals have already been announced so far this year in the sector, the highest since Thomson Reuters began tracking data. Several more are in the works, and many of those have tax arbitrage as one of the crucial drivers for the transaction as well.As the industry had feared, Pfizer's plans have triggered concerns in Washington, with lawmakers calling for comprehensive tax reform. On Wednesday, a U.S. Treasury official said the Obama administration is seeking ways to curb tax-dodging by U.S. businesses that reincorporate overseas.""Inversion transactions illustrate the need for comprehensive business tax reform that would lower corporate tax rates and limit the ability of multinationals to shift income outside the U.S.,"" the Treasury official said, noting that the administration knows such deals ""are occurring and aren't being caught by the current rules."" Analysts and lawmakers say the chances of Congress passing a new law anytime before the November mid-term U.S. elections are slim given the gridlock between Democrats and Republicans over the tax reform question. They expect Congress to take up tax reform sometime next year.""Without some kind of tax reform in this country, there are huge benefits to large multinationals re-domiciling into more tax-friendly jurisdictions,"" Ray McGuire, Citigroup Inc's global head of corporate and investment banking, told an M&A panel at the Milken Institute Global Conference in Los Angeles earlier this week.NOT ALL ARBITRAGE While tax advantages have become a major driver for deals, bankers and lawyers said their clients in general are thinking of business needs first when assessing potential targets. The frenzied dealmaking in healthcare comes as the industry restructures amid healthcare spending cuts and competition from cheap generics.""People may be pitching clients to do inversions now because of a concern that the rules may change over time, but the companies we deal with every day are thoughtful about these things and do not just chase deals for tax purposes alone,"" said Gordon Caplan, a partner at Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP.Buying AstraZeneca, for example, would boost Pfizer's pipeline of cancer drugs and generate significant cost savings. But it would also allow it to re-domicile to Britain and enjoy lower tax rates.U.S. drugmaker Mylan, which has been seeking to buy Swedish drugmaker Meda AB, was looking to do an inversion deal because it was at a disadvantage compared to foreign generic rivals, people close to the matter said. Major competitors include Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd, which is based in Israel, and Actavis Plc, which re-domiciled to Ireland through a 2013 acquisition of Warner Chilcott. Both face lower tax rates.Mylan, these people said, is also worried that if it doesn't complete an acquisition, it would be bought by another company that has already completed an inversion.Similarly, Allergan first approached Shire Plc in recent months in part because of the tax arbitrage opportunity. But now it, too, faces the prospect of being swallowed up by an unwanted bidder, Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc in partnership with activist investor Bill Ackman. That has prompted Allergan to consider once again making a bid for Shire, despite being rebuffed when it made a previous overture, sources told Reuters earlier this week.""There is a sense that the government will change the tax rules, when and if they get around to rewriting the tax code as they have talked about doing,"" said one M&A lawyer who is working on these deals and therefore did not want to be identified. ""So if people want to do these deals they better do them soon.""(The story corrects spelling of Willkie in paragraph 18 from 'Wilkie')(Additional reporting by Kevin Drawbaugh in Washington and Greg Roumeliotis in Los Angeles; Editing by Paritosh Bansal, Martin Howell)",2014-05-01,PFE,"Thu May 1, 2014 | 9:53am EDT",Pfizer's designs on AstraZeneca stir tax envy among rivals,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-usa-tax-mergers-idUSBREA4003G20140501?type=companyNews

Shares of ConocoPhillips gained 2 percent to $76.52 while the stock of Chevron, which posted a lower-than-expected quarterly profit on Friday, dipped 0.2 percent to $124.72.The S&P 500 healthcare sector, down 0.8 percent, was among the day's weakest sectors.

106,"   By Ben Hirschler | LONDON  LONDON U.S. drugmaker Pfizer Inc increased its offer for AstraZeneca Plc to 63 billion pounds ($106 billion) on Friday, but the British company promptly rejected the proposal, which would create the world's biggest pharmaceuticals company.AstraZeneca's board said the offer undervalued the company ""substantially"" and was not an adequate basis on which to engage with its suitor.Industry analysts and investors said that raised the possibility that Pfizer would now take the takeover plan, which would boost its pipeline of cancer drugs and create significant tax and cost savings, direct to AstraZeneca shareholders.The U.S. group would much prefer an agreed deal, since hostile takeovers typically take longer, require a higher final price and carry more risks because the bidder cannot access the target's books to assess its business.One AstraZeneca investor said Pfizer management had made clear in meetings this week that it wanted a friendly deal but it was determined to the see the transaction completed and a hostile bid was a potential ""tool"".While Pfizer has given assurances to the British government on retaining drug research in Britain, a spokesman for Prime Minister David Cameron said AstraZeneca's fate would be determined by shareholders, not the state.Friday's 50 pounds ($84.47) a share indicative offer followed AstraZeneca's decision to rebuff an earlier proposal that valued it at 58.8 billion pounds, or 46.61 pounds per share.Some investors and analysts had expected that the sweetened offer would be enough to bring AstraZeneca's board to the negotiating table, even if it was not accepted, and the swift rejection suggests Pfizer may now go over the board's head.""I think it's making it increasingly likely that Pfizer is going to come back with a hostile bid,"" said Mick Cooper, analyst at Edison Investment Research.Leading investors have met with Pfizer Chief Executive Ian Read this week in London and some feel that an offer of 50 pounds or above is certainly worth discussing.""Given where the shares have come from, this doesn't look unreasonable,"" one of AstraZeneca's 10 largest shareholders said of the latest Pfizer offer. AstraZeneca shares were trading at around 30 pounds a year ago, but confidence in the company's cancer drug pipeline has built up strongly since then.""We expect Pfizer ultimately to have to sweeten its offer based on discussions we have had with investors, many citing a price within the 52-55 pounds range and some above this, and our analysis of the EPS accretion for Pfizer,"" said Mark Clark, an analyst at Deutsche Bank.Investors had previously said they were looking for at least 50 pounds a share and also wanted more cash in the mix. The new offer would have given them 32 percent cash and 68 percent shares, little different from the 30-70 split offered originally.Many analysts are convinced Pfizer will raise its offer again, not least because it wants to get the deal done before any possible change in U.S. tax rules that might prevent it moving its tax base to Britain.Pfizer's latest proposal would have seen shareholders receiving, for each AstraZeneca share, 1.845 shares in the combined company and 15.98 pounds in cash. Commenting on the offer, AstraZeneca Chairman Leif Johansson said: ""Pfizer's proposal would dramatically dilute AstraZeneca shareholders' exposure to our unique pipeline and would create risks around its delivery.""He also highlighted the fact that the small cash component would leave investors exposed to the risks faced by Pfizer in executing an ambitious mega-merger.POLITICAL STORM Shares in the British group slipped back 0.2 percent to 48.07 pounds by 1335 GMT. The stock had already gained ground in late trading on Thursday on speculation that Pfizer would come back with an improved offer, including a larger cash element, and there was some disappointment that the cash component had not increased more.Pfizer shares fell 0.5 percent in early New York trading.The takeover plan, which would be the largest acquisition of a British company by a foreign business, has stirred political controversy in Britain. In an attempt to smooth relations with the government, Pfizer CEO Read wrote to Cameron, promising to complete a substantial new research center planned by AstraZeneca in Cambridge and retain a manufacturing plant in Macclesfield.The Cambridge site, in particular, is viewed as important to the development of the so-called ""golden triangle"" of Britain's life sciences industry, spanning Oxford, Cambridge and London.Read also said that 20 percent of the enlarged group's research and development workforce would be in Britain, which a Pfizer spokesman said would represent a ""very substantial"" increase in its research efforts in the country.""We make these commitments for a minimum of five years, recognizing our ability, consistent with our fiduciary duties, to adjust these obligations should circumstances significantly change,"" Read added in a letter to Cameron.Science minister David Willetts said Pfizer had moved a long way in its commitments to British science and research, but the opposition Labour party was scathing about the potential deal.""Pfizer has a very poor record on previous acquisitions. Do we really want a jewel in the crown of British industry, our second biggest pharmaceutical firm, to basically be seen as an instrument of tax planning?"" said business spokesman Chuka Umunna.Pfizer's reputation is under a cloud in Britain following a decision three years ago to shut most of its research work at a large R&D center in Sandwich, southern England, where Viagra was invented, with the loss of nearly 2,000 jobs.Any eventual deal will be studied by antitrust regulators around the world, including those in China, where scrutiny could be especially intense since Pfizer and AstraZeneca rank No. 1 and No. 2 among multinational suppliers in the country's prescription drug market.($1 = 0.5919 British Pounds)(Additional reporting by Paul Sandle, Kate Holton, Brenda Goh, Chris Vellacott and Soyoung Kim; Editing by David Goodman, David Holmes and Will Waterman)",2014-05-02,PFE,"Fri May 2, 2014 | 1:22pm EDT",AstraZeneca rejects Pfizer's raised bid of $106 billion,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-astrazeneca-pfizer-idUSBREA3R0H520140502?type=companyNews

Pfizer's latest proposal would have seen shareholders receiving, for each AstraZeneca share, 1.845 shares in the combined company and 15.98 pounds in cash.     Commenting on the offer, AstraZeneca Chairman Leif Johansson said: ""Pfizer's proposal would dramatically dilute AstraZeneca shareholders' exposure to our unique pipeline and would create risks around its delivery.""     He also highlighted the fact that the small cash component would leave investors exposed to the risks faced by Pfizer in executing an ambitious mega-merger.       POLITICAL STORM     Shares in the British group slipped back 0.2 percent to 48.07 pounds by 1335 GMT. The stock had already gained ground in late trading on Thursday on speculation that Pfizer would come back with an improved offer, including a larger cash element, and there was some disappointment that the cash component had not increased more.     Pfizer shares fell 0.5 percent in early New York trading.     The takeover plan, which would be the largest acquisition of  a British company by a foreign business, has stirred political controversy in Britain.     In an attempt to smooth relations with the government, Pfizer CEO Read wrote to Cameron, promising to complete a substantial new research centre planned by AstraZeneca in Cambridge and retain a manufacturing plant in Macclesfield.     The Cambridge site, in particular, is viewed as important to the development of the so-called ""golden triangle"" of Britain's life sciences industry, spanning Oxford, Cambridge and London.      Read also said that 20 percent of the enlarged group's research and development workforce would be in Britain, which a Pfizer spokesman said would represent a ""very substantial"" increase in its research efforts in the country.     ""We make these commitments for a minimum of five years, recognising our ability, consistent with our fiduciary duties, to adjust these obligations should circumstances significantly change,"" Read added in a letter to Cameron.     Science minister David Willetts said Pfizer had moved a long way in its commitments to British science and research, but the opposition Labour party was scathing about the potential deal.     ""Pfizer has a very poor record on previous acquisitions. Do we really want a jewel in the crown of British industry, our second biggest pharmaceutical firm, to basically be seen as an instrument of tax planning?"" said business spokesman Chuka Umunna.     Pfizer's reputation is under a cloud in Britain following a decision three years ago to shut most of its research work at a large R&D centre in Sandwich, southern England, where Viagra was invented, with the loss of nearly 2,000 jobs.     Any eventual deal will be studied by antitrust regulators around the world, including those in China, where scrutiny could be especially intense since Pfizer and AstraZeneca rank No. 1 and No. 2 among multinational suppliers in the country's prescription drug market.

While the report provided an encouraging read on the labor market, many market participants said Wall Street's gains over the week made further advances unlikely.""The market has gotten to fairly full level in terms of valuation, and at this point, we need strong earnings to drive the market higher. Economic news is not enough for some at this point,"" said Rick Meckler, president of investment firm LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey.So far in this earnings season, 75 percent, or 374 companies, in the S&P 500 have reported. Among those, 68.2 percent beat analysts' earnings expectations, 9.9 percent met expectations and 21.9 percent were below estimates, according to data complied by Thomson Reuters. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 22.15 points, or 0.13 percent, to 16,536.72, the S&P 500 lost 1.31 points, or 0.07 percent, to 1,882.37 and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 8.075 points, or 0.2 percent, to 4,119.376.Despite the day's decline, all three indexes are still up more than 1 percent for the week.U.S. job growth picked up at its fastest pace in more than two years in April and the unemployment rate dived to a 5-1/2 year low of 6.3 percent, the Labor Department said. The payrolls gain of 288,000 was the largest since January 2012 and beat Wall Street's expectations for an increase of just 210,000. The unemployment rate tumbled 0.4 percentage point, touching its lowest since September 2008. The Labor Department attributed the decline to a drop in the number of unemployed people reentering the labor market as well as a fall in new entrants into the labor force.In company news, U.S. drugmaker Pfizer Inc 's sweetened 63 billion pound ($106 billion) bid for AstraZeneca Plc was promptly rejected by the British company Friday.

Part-nationalised RBS surged 9.2 percent, the top FTSE 100 riser, after trebling its profit in the first quarter, benefiting from improved cost control and a reduction in losses from bad loans.Jefferies said the bank's earnings were more than twice consensus estimates, with impairments 48 percent below forecast.Also rising after robust results was InterContinental Hotels Group, which proposed a special dividend along with its strongest room revenue performance in seven quarters. Its shares jumped 8.1 percent.""InterContinental has delivered a stellar performance. Growth in revenue per available room is ahead of expectation ... while the return of hotel sale proceeds in the form of a special dividend is ahead of schedule,"" Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers equity analyst Keith Bowman said. Meanwhile, non-farm payrolls showed the U.S. economy added 288,000 jobs in April, beating a 210,000 consensus forecast and fuelling the view that the world's biggest economy is regaining pace after bad weather hit growth early in the year.RBS, IHG and the encouraging U.S. data helped lift the FTSE 100 by 17.03 points, or 0.3 percent, to 6,825.90 points by 1506 GMT, a fresh two-month high.Of companies that have reported quarterly earnings so far, 82 percent of FTSE 100 companies have beaten or met expectations, compared to 57 percent of STOXX Europe 600  companies. However, only 18 percent have met or beaten forecasts for revenues on the FTSE 100, Thomson Reuters StarMine data showed.""(The StarMine) figures tell you everything you need to know.

111,"   By Ben Hirschler | LONDON  LONDON U.S. drugmaker Pfizer Inc's effort to sweeten its bid for Britain's AstraZenaca Plc with commitments on research, manufacturing and jobs is claimed as a coup by the UK government, but many are deeply skeptical.Pfizer Chief Executive Ian Read wrote to Prime Minster David Cameron giving a five-year commitment to complete a new research center in Cambridge, retain a factory in Macclesfield, and put a fifth of its research staff in Britain.Cameron's spokesman described the letter as ""a positive sign with significant undertakings on research, jobs and investment"".Yet five years is not long at all in an industry like pharmaceuticals, with 10 to 15 year product cycles, and Pfizer made clear it could ""adjust these obligations should circumstances significantly change"".Britain has been burnt before on foreign takeovers - notably Kraft Foods Group Inc's 2010 acquisition of Cadbury, when the U.S. firm promised to keep open a key factory, only to renege on that soon after the deal was completed.Pfizer's reputation is also under a cloud following a decision three years ago to shut most of its research work at a large R&D center in Sandwich, southern England, where Viagra was invented, with the loss of nearly 2,000 jobs.Against that background, trades unions urged ministers and AstraZeneca shareholders not to be wooed by Pfizer's warm words.""Similar undertakings were given by U.S. multinationals before which have proved to be worthless,"" said Allan Black, national officer for the chemicals industry at the GMB Union. Chuka Umunna, business spokesman for Britain's opposition Labour party, told BBC radio that Pfizer's previous acquisitions had ""led to deep cuts in the research facilities and ... intellectual asset-stripping"".A Pfizer spokesman said in response to those claims that the company recognized that its bid approach created uncertainty, which is why it had taken the unusual step of giving long-term commitments.Pfizer executives said those commitments were based on placing more drug discovery work in Britain to tap into its great science and its history of collaboration between private and public sectors.""The quality of the science that is done in the UK is second to none,"" Rod MacKenzie, Pfizer's head of PharmaTherapeutics R&D, told Reuters in an interview. PATENT BOX The U.S. group will also benefit from Britain's ""patent box"" system, which came into effect last year and offers a special ultra-low 10 percent tax rate on profits earned from patents.MacKenzie said the 20 percent staff commitment would translate into much greater investment by Pfizer in the country: ""We will be increasing our R&D workforce in the UK - it will be a substantial increase.""But he declined to give a specific prediction of how many scientists the combined company would employ in Britain, if the deal comes off, and also declined to speculate as to what the increased research effort in Britain would mean for Pfizer laboratories in other countries. AstraZeneca, which employs 6,700 staff in Britain, has plans to open a new $500 million research and corporate headquarters in Cambridge, southern England, by 2016 - the centerpiece of chief executive Pascal Soriot's overhaul of the company and, the government hopes, a new beacon for British life sciences.The current plan is for the Cambridge site to house 1,600 scientists and 400 head office staff, and MacKenzie said Pfizer would broadly follow through on that plan.""The intent is to build out essentially the strategy that they had, whether it is 1,600 exactly I'm not sure, but it would be certainly of that order,"" he said.Roger Barker, director of corporate governance at the Institute of Directors, cautioned against viewing Pfizer's move as a U.S. giant seeking to gobble up a key part of Britain.""It is misleading to present AstraZeneca as some kind of UK national champion,"" he said, noting that the firm is a multinational enterprise that was created through mergers British, Swedish and American companies.""The majority of its employees are based outside Europe and its shareholders are overwhelmingly foreign institutional investors,"" he said. ""It is run by a Frenchman and chaired by a Swede. It is a multinational company active in a global economy.""(Writing by Kate Kelland; Editing by Will Waterman)",2014-05-02,PFE,"Fri May 2, 2014 | 11:10am EDT",Pfizer's science vows to Britain: promise or placebo?,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-astrazeneca-pfizer-science-idUSBREA410KK20140502?type=companyNews
112,"   By Ransdell Pierson and Bill Berkrot | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Employees at Pfizer Inc's U.S. research centers, such as the La Jolla, California site that specializes in cancer drugs, may want to dust off their resumes if the company's proposed acquisition of Britain's AstraZeneca comes to fruition.Pfizer said on Friday it was determined to reach a deal that would restore its status as the world's biggest pharmaceutical company despite AstraZeneca's rejection of its latest cash and stock offer of 63 billion pounds ($106 billion).To reassure the British government about its proposal, Pfizer has promised the combined company would keep 20 percent of its research and development workforce in the country. It also vowed to complete construction of a research center planned by AstraZeneca in Cambridge, England, and retain a manufacturing plant in the northern town of Macclesfield.""There's no doubt in my mind that if they are making these concessions to the British government, there will be cuts on this side of the Atlantic,"" said Raghuram Selvaraju, healthcare equity research analyst with Aegis Capital.Cost savings through large numbers of job cuts, typically described by companies as ""synergies,"" are a key component of any big merger deal. A Pfizer deal for AstraZeneca would be no different.Since the deal would give Pfizer control of AstraZeneca's extensive and promising portfolio of oncology drugs in development, Pfizer's own cancer and vaccine research center on the Pacific coast near San Diego could face the chopping block. ""If I was a Pfizer R&D employee in the U.S. and this merger goes through, I would be very fearful of my job, especially if I was based in La Jolla,"" Selvaraju said.""Pfizer has a history of shutting down facilities; they don't thin down head count; they shut down an entire facility and pick up their stakes and move away.""Pfizer declined to comment on where any job cuts might come from. The company would not disclose how many people work at the La Jolla facilities or other U.S. research centers. Pfizer's 25-acre La Jolla campus includes five buildings totaling more than 500,000 square feet, with specialized laboratories and equipment.John LaMattina, Pfizer's research chief from 2004 to 2007 and currently a senior partner at PureTech Ventures in Boston, agreed that the La Jolla cancer research jobs as well as neuroscience researchers in Cambridge, Massachusetts, were likely in jeopardy. He said Pfizer could also fold its U.S.-based immunology and respiratory research into existing AstraZeneca operations in Britain.""If I was in any of these places, I'd worry about this deal going through,"" said LaMattina, noting that three oncology research sites that existed when he was in charge were later consolidated into the one California site. Pfizer spent $6.68 billion on research and development in 2013, down from an R&D budget of $7.48 billion in 2012. At its height following the 2009 acquisition of Wyeth, R&D expenses were about $11 billion.With Pfizer's promise to protect the UK research, jobs at AstraZeneca's oncology and neuroscience research centers near Boston and its MedImmune cancer research and development operation in Gaithersburg, Maryland, could also come under the cost-cutting knife.Selvaraju said wholesale job cuts in the United States appeared likely because workers here have less protection than in Europe. ""It's easier to let people go,"" he said, noting employers don't have to give much severance or that much notice.Leerink Partners analyst Seamus Fernandez agreed that a significant portion of the synergies ""will come from the substantial overlaps in the U.S."" He also predicted some cuts would come from duplications in emerging markets and in Germany.""This deal makes a lot of sense from a business standpoint,"" LaMattina said. ""But for R&D it stinks.""(Editing by Frank McGurty and David Gregorio)",2014-05-03,PFE,"Sat May 3, 2014 | 8:11am EDT",Pfizer U.S. research jobs jeopardized by promises to UK for merger,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-astrazeneca-pfizer-jobs-analysis-idUSBREA4205520140503?type=companyNews

The raised offer followed unsolicited Pfizer approaches in late April and January.Investors and analysts say Pfizer needs to raise its offer as high as 52 to 55 pounds per share to close the deal, as well as increase the cash portion to as much as 50 percent from around 30 percent.While several analysts and shareholders said Pfizer needs to do a deal of this sort to restore its fading competitive edge, those who talked to Reuters did not believe Chief Executive Ian Read was likely to go over the heads of AstraZeneca management and directly to shareholders quickly.

Pfizer has declined to comment on its strategy.""We believe we will make an offer that is attractive to the shareholders of AstraZeneca,"" said Pfizer spokeswoman Joan Campion.A hostile bid would be complicated by the fact that Pfizer needs the deal to have a substantial stock component in order to do the tax inversion and re-domicile in Britain.

115,"   By William James | LONDON  LONDON Britain's opposition Labour party called on Sunday for an inquiry into a potential takeover of British firm AstraZeneca by U.S. drugmaker Pfizer, accusing the government of ""cheerleading"" for a deal.AstraZeneca on Friday rejected a 63 billion pound ($106 billion) bid from Pfizer, but the U.S. firm is expected to pursue its efforts to acquire Britain's second largest pharmaceutical company.""We need a more substantive assessment of whether this takeover is in the national economic interest before the UK government allows itself to be seen to be supporting it,"" Labour leader Ed Miliband said in a letter to Prime Minister David Cameron.While the government has talked with both AstraZeneca and Pfizer, it has said it has no intention of intervening in the deal and considers it a matter for the companies' boards and shareholders.But a year away from a national election, which polls show Labour would win if the vote were held now, Miliband's comments emphasize the high political, as well as financial, stakes.Party leaders want to be seen protecting Britain's interests while avoiding nationalistic rhetoric that may spook other future overseas investment. Ministers from the current two-party coalition have been pressing Pfizer over jobs and continued investment in research and development facilities in Britain. On Friday, Cameron's office said he was considering assurances from Pfizer Chief Executive Ian Read.""We are going to have tests which ensure that this get-together becomes a great Anglo-American project, or it doesn't happen,"" Conservative party Spokesman Grant Shapps told Sky TV.Miliband said the government's approach so far amounted to cheerleading for Pfizer's bid. ""I have seen the assurances you have received from Pfizer, but this merger would have an impact for decades to come, so it is not enough to have a few specific promises that only last for the next few years,"" Miliband said in his letter.BUSINESS ATTITUDE The centre-right Conservative party has cast the potential takeover as a success for finance minister George Osborne in attracting foreign companies to Britain by creating a favorable tax and regulatory environment. For centre-left Labour however, the call for government intervention to defend national interests is the latest move to take on big businesses in the name of protecting voters.Business lobby groups have expressed concern over Labour's hands-on approach to markets, while the government has called the party ""anti-business"". However opinion polls show Labour has 36 percent of the public vote, a 3 percentage point lead over Cameron's Conservatives.Last year Labour wiped billions off the share values of energy firms by announcing that it would freeze electricity prices for 20 months if it won power, and has since launched similar campaigns to shake up the banking and water industries.Miliband said last week that he wanted to take on landlords with a set of new rules governing the property rental market, and on Sunday he said he was looking at whether the government should take a greater role in running railways.($1 = 0.5927 British Pounds)(Editing by Catherine Evans/Ruth Pitchford)",2014-05-04,PFE,"Sun May 4, 2014 | 8:01am EDT",UK's Labour call for inquiry into Pfizer's AstraZeneca bid,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-astrazeneca-pfizer-politics-idUSBREA4301S20140504?type=companyNews

On Friday, Cameron's office said he was considering assurances from Pfizer Chief Executive Ian Read.""We are going to have tests which ensure that this get-together becomes a great Anglo-American project, or it doesn't happen,"" Conservative party Spokesman Grant Shapps told Sky TV.Miliband said the government's approach so far amounted to cheerleading for Pfizer's bid. ""I have seen the assurances you have received from Pfizer, but this merger would have an impact for decades to come, so it is not enough to have a few specific promises that only last for the next few years,"" Miliband said in his letter.BUSINESS ATTITUDE  The centre-right Conservative party has cast the potential takeover as a success for finance minister George Osborne in attracting foreign companies to Britain by creating a favourable tax and regulatory environment.For centre-left Labour however, the call for government intervention to defend national interests is the latest move to take on big businesses in the name of protecting voters.Business lobby groups have expressed concern over Labour's hands-on approach to markets, while the government has called the party ""anti-business"". However opinion polls show Labour has 36 percent of the public vote, a 3 percentage point lead over Cameron's Conservatives.Last year Labour wiped billions off the share values of energy firms by announcing that it would freeze electricity prices for 20 months if it won power, and has since launched similar campaigns to shake up the banking and water industries.Miliband said last week that he wanted to take on landlords with a set of new rules governing the property rental market, and on Sunday he said he was looking at whether the government should take a greater role in running railways.($1 = 0.5927 British Pounds)   (Editing by Catherine Evans/Ruth Pitchford)",2014-05-04,PFE,"Sun May 4, 2014 | 7:55am EDT",UPDATE 2-UK's Labour call for inquiry into Pfizer's AstraZeneca bid,http://www.reuters.com//article/astrazeneca-pfizer-politics-idUSL6N0NQ06R20140504?type=companyNews

118,"   By Ransdell Pierson and Bill Berkrot | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Pfizer Inc's top officials said on Monday they are weighing all strategies, including potential hostile maneuvers, in the company's effort to seal a $106 billion takeover of British drugmaker AstraZeneca Plc.""Any option you can think of would be an option,"" Pfizer Chief Financial Officer Frank D'Amelio said in a telephone interview, when asked whether Pfizer might take its case directly to AstraZeneca shareholders before a May 26 deadline.That is the date by which British takeover law requires Pfizer to either make a bid for the London-based rival or walk away, unless both companies agree to seek an extension of the deadline.""What we really need is to have AstraZeneca engage with us,"" D'Amelio said. ""We need to be able to do the right kind of analytics that need to get done,"" he added, referring to the ability to study the British drugmaker's books.Asked whether hostile moves could hurt integration of the two companies, Chief Executive Ian Read said, ""No, in my opinion, all it does is delay the planning."" Regardless of whether the deal arises from friendly negotiations or a hostile approach, it is likely to end on good terms if successfully completed, Read said.""Both companies are full of really great people that realize this is the organization they're in and they want to make it as successful as possible,"" he said.Pfizer on Friday raised its initial cash and stock offer from about $99 billion to $106 billion in its third effort to bring AstraZeneca management to the table. AstraZeneca quickly rejected the new bid, which said it significantly undervalued the company. Read, who said he was disappointed by the company's refusal to engage, last week met with a small number of top AstraZeneca investors in Britain to hear their views on a deal.""We listened to their shareholders and made what we thought was a compelling offer which fully valued AstraZeneca,"" he said. The latest offer would value AstraZeneca at about 50 pounds per share. Investors and analysts say Pfizer may need to raise its bid to 52 pounds to 55 pounds to reach a deal.Earlier on Monday, Pfizer reported disappointing first quarter sales, but slightly beat Wall Street earnings forecasts due to sharp cost cuts. Sales came in $730 million below analysts' expectations on declines for its older generic medicines and for key branded products, such as Viagra, Lipitor and Celebrex.Asked if Pfizer would pursue a different big drugmaker if its efforts to buy AstraZeneca fail, Read said, ""Right now we're focused on winning on Plan A.""Are there other strategies? There's always other strategies,"" Read said.(Reporting by Ransdell Pierson and Bill Berkrot; Editing by Michele Gershberg, Bernadette Baum and Richard Chang)",2014-05-05,PFE,"Mon May 5, 2014 | 4:02pm EDT",Pfizer signals open to hostile option for AstraZeneca,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-pfizer-astrazeneca-idUSBREA440N720140505?type=companyNews

The Institute for Supply Management said its services sector index rose in April, hitting the fastest pace in eight months and topping expectations.Shares had opened lower, weighed by geopolitical events as Ukrainian forces were ambushed by separatists on Monday, triggering heavy fighting on the outskirts of the rebel stronghold of Slaviansk, a day after a Ukrainian police station in Odessa was stormed.""We shook off a lot of the morning jitters, and the ISM services came out and showed pretty good growth, and that obviously brought back some buyers,"" said Ryan Detrick, senior technical strategist at Schaeffer's Investment Research in Cincinnati, Ohio.

121,"   By Ransdell Pierson and Bill Berkrot | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) reported quarterly revenue well below Wall Street expectations on falling sales of key brands and generic drugs, underscoring its interest in pursuing a $106 billion bid for rival AstraZeneca (AZN.L) to promote new business growth.Pfizer said on Monday it raised its bid last week in response to what it had heard from AstraZeneca shareholders and believed it to be a ""compelling"" offer.AstraZeneca quickly rejected the sweetened bid, saying it ""substantially"" undervalued the company, and on Monday it declined to comment on Pfizer's substantial revenue shortfall in the first quarter.""We are very disappointed with their unwillingness to engage in conversations,"" Pfizer Chief Executive Officer Ian Read said of AstraZeneca's management.Pfizer said total first-quarter revenue fell 9 percent to $11.35 billion, which was $730 million below Wall Street expectations. Revenue would have fallen 6 percent, if not for the stronger dollar, which lowers the value of sales outside the United States.Pfizer shares fell 2.6 percent to $29.95 in midday trading.To assuage concerns about potential layoffs of researchers in Britain, Pfizer vowed that 20 percent of the research and development workforce of a combined company would remain in the U.K. That created fears that U.S. researchers would bear the brunt of expected job cuts, especially those at its oncology research center in La Jolla, California.Read, on a conference call with analysts on Monday, said the company will maintain ""a massive presence"" of researchers in the United States, but did not provide specifics.The largest U.S. drugmaker earned $2.33 billion, or 36 cents per share, in the quarter. That compared with $2.75 billion, or 38 cents, in the year-earlier period, when the company reported gains from the transfer of product rights. Excluding special items, Pfizer earned 57 cents per share.Analysts, on average, expected 55 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.""Definitely the results on the top line came in weaker than we were anticipating,"" said Morningstar analyst Damien Conover, who cited disappointing sales of generics outside the United States.Pfizer's earnings ultimately met his expectations because the company was able to cut costs, Conover said.Pfizer still expects 2014 adjusted earnings of $2.20 to $2.30 per share, but the forecast assumes that painkiller Celebrex will not face U.S. generic competition this year.

It made its second spurned approach on April 26, with an offer valued at 50 pounds ($84.34) a share.

Proceeds from those deals also enabled Pfizer to aggressively buy back shares and boost its dividend.Pfizer has said, however, it could not divest any of its units until 2017, after it has compiled three years of sales and earnings data for each.In its earnings report, Pfizer said it still expected to buy back about $5 billion worth of its shares this year, with $1.7 billion already repurchased.Sales at its Vaccines, Oncology and Consumer Healthcare unit dipped by $20 million to $2.17 billion, while sales of global innovative pharmaceuticals, involving drugs that still have patent protection, fell 7 percent to $3.07 billion.(Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)",2014-05-05,PFE,"Mon May 5, 2014 | 1:09pm EDT",Pfizer sales way off mark as company pursues AstraZeneca,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-pfizer-results-idUSBREA4409J20140505?type=companyNews

The former Soviet republic is sliding toward war.""The short-term issue is Ukraine.

The 10-day volume average was just under 16 million. The S&P 500 is just 1.2 percent below its record close set a month ago. Despite improving economic data, including a narrowing of the trade gap reported earlier on Tuesday, the S&P 500 is facing a technical hurdle as it nears its all-time high.""We're at resistance and we need something credible to push us through it. The economy has to undergo a transition from a very weak first quarter, and we're waiting for more proof on that,"" said Harbor Advisory's De Gan.The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI fell 129.53 points or 0.78 percent, to 16,401.02, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 16.94 points or 0.9 percent, to 1,867.72 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 57.296 points or 1.38 percent, to 4,080.759. AIG (AIG.N) shares fell 4.1 percent to $50.54 a day after posting a 27 percent drop in quarterly income. Financials .SPSY, down 1.4 percent, were the largest decliners among the S&P 500's top ten industry sectors.Athenahealth (ATHN.O) shares slumped 13.9 percent to $109.21, a day after hedge fund manager David Einhorn said the company is part of a portfolio of overvalued stocks his Greenlight Capital was betting against. Office Depot Inc ODP.N raised its forecast for full-year adjusted operating income and said it would close at least 400 stores in the United States over two years, sending shares up 15.8 percent to $4.83.Adding to a string of major deals in the healthcare industry, Bayer (BAYGn.DE) acquired Merck's (MRK.N) consumer care business for $14.2 billion.

132,"   By Ben Hirschler | LONDON  LONDON AstraZeneca Plc laid out its defense against Pfizer Inc's $106-billion takeover approach on Tuesday by predicting its sales would rise by three quarters over the next decade, although only after a short-term drop.With promising new medicines expected to lift annual revenue above $45 billion by 2023, up from $25.7 billion in 2013, selling out to the U.S. group now would deprive investors of huge gains, it argued.""The increasingly visible success of our independent strategy highlights the future prospects for our shareholders,"" said Chairman Leif Johansson. ""These are benefits that should fully accrue to AstraZeneca's shareholders.""Chief Executive Pascal Soriot said plunging AstraZeneca into a disruptive merger would also jeopardize its ability to deliver on the new drug pipeline, which is expected to account for 30 percent of the 2023 sales total.Investors and analysts agree Britain's second-biggest drugmaker has an improving experimental portfolio in areas ranging from cancer to asthma, but they remain nervous about the uncertain commercial future of many products.AstraZeneca has rebuffed three approaches from Pfizer, which wants to create the world's biggest pharmaceuticals company - and cut its tax bill - by buying the group. It said on Friday that the U.S. firm's latest offer of 50 pounds a share ""substantially"" undervalued the company.The group has not ruled out a deal altogether, however, and people familiar with the matter said it was willing to talk if there were a compelling offer. Several large shareholders have told Reuters they would be open to a deal at a higher level.Shares in AstraZeneca were down 2.7 percent at 46.80 pounds at  11:10 am ET (1510 GMT).""OVERLY OPTIMISTIC"" Sales are set to fall over the next three years as older medicines lose patent protection, slipping to $24.5 billion by 2016 and $23.6 billion in 2017, according to Thomson Reuters consensus analyst forecasts. AstraZeneca has previously said it disagrees with analysts and sees sales back up at last year's level by 2017. Now it is forecasting ""strong and consistent"" growth from 2017 to 2023, driven by new treatments for cancer, diabetes, heart disease and lung disorders.It also flagged up a possible therapy for Alzheimer's disease, a notoriously high-risk area for drug development.Growth in core earnings per share, which excludes certain items, is expected to exceed revenue growth during this period, it added.Jefferies analysts said the forecasts appeared ""overly optimistic"" but the detailed product breakdown might help raise the price and cash mix in any deal. In addition to a higher bid, AstraZeneca also insists there should be more cash than the 32 percent suggested by Pfizer, with the balance paid in shares.AstraZeneca launched its 10-year sales forecast defense salvo a day after Pfizer CEO Ian Read renewed his call for the British company's board to enter talks. Read insisted his offer was ""compelling"" and signaled he was now weighing all options, including a possible hostile bid or looking at other targets, though he stressed that buying AstraZeneca remained ""Plan A"".Pfizer's pursuit of AstraZeneca has created a political stir in Britain, with critics of the U.S. group's approach fearing that a takeover will lead to big cuts in drug research, despite assurances given by Pfizer to the government.Officials have said a deal would be a commercial matter for the two companies but business minister Vince Cable said Britain could use its powers to assess if a takeover was in the public interest, while lawmakers called on Pfizer's bosses to appear before parliament.CANCER FOCUS Most investor interest centers on AstraZeneca's experimental cancer medicines designed to boost the immune system. Such drugs promise to revolutionize treatment of many tumor types and would also complement Pfizer's line-up of oncology medicines. But AstraZeneca is lagging rivals such as Bristol-Myers Squibb Co, Merck & Co and Roche Holding AG in this field.""This is a company that has made significant progress in moving its pipeline forward over the last 18 months,"" said Alistair Campbell, an analyst at Berenberg Bank. ""Is it enough on a fundamental basis to justify the current share price? Personally, I don't think so - at least not without the certainty you need in terms of knowing clinical trial outcomes.""Among individual products, AstraZeneca said heart drug Brilinta had the potential to deliver annual sales of around $3.5 billion by 2023, with diabetes and respiratory medicines both adding about $8 billion apiece.In cancer it forecast potential peak sales of $6.5 billion for its experimental immunotherapy drug MEDI4736 - the product that has excited most interest from investors and analysts.AstraZeneca said last month it planned to push ahead with late-stage Phase III testing of MEDI4736, following evaluation of positive Phase I data that will be presented at an American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) conference on May 30-June 3.The detailed presentations on this and other experimental cancer medicines will be important for AstraZeneca and rivals, and could move its shares - but may be just too late for the Pfizer bid battle.Pfizer has a deadline of May 26 to make a firm offer or walk away under British ""put up or shut up"" takeover rules.""They've got drug candidates in what look to be really exciting areas,"" said Dan Mahony, a fund manager at Polar Capital, who raised his stake in AstraZeneca last year. ""But it is not clear to us yet who, across the industry, has the best drug.""(Additional reporting by Anjuli Davies; Editing by David Stamp and Will Waterman)",2014-05-06,PFE,"Tue May 6, 2014 | 12:05pm EDT",AstraZeneca fights Pfizer bid by predicting sales surge - eventually,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-astrazeneca-pfizer-idUSBREA3R0H520140506?type=companyNews
133,"  (Adds explanation of public interest intervention)LONDON May 6 Britain could use its public interest powers to intervene in U.S. drugmaker Pfizer's  potential takeover of British pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca , Business Secretary Vince Cable said on Tuesday.Prime Minister David Cameron is facing growing pressure from lawmakers to secure undertakings from the New York-based company if it pulls off Britain's biggest takeover by a foreign buyer.""The government must and will approach it from a position of even-handed neutrality and recognise that this is ultimately a matter for the shareholders of both companies,"" Cable told parliament. ""One of our options as the government would be to consider using our public interest test powers. This would be a serious step and not one that would be taken lightly but I'm open-minded about it whilst stressing that we are operating within serious European legal constraints."" The public interest test is enshrined in British merger law and gives ministers the power to intervene in deals, but only for a limited number of reasons, mainly national security, media company mergers and banks.Cable said the current structure did not give the government scope to address concerns about jobs and research and development investment raised by the potential Pfizer takeover.

134,"  * Forecasts $45 billion sales by 2023 as new drugs deliver* EPS growth expected to exceed revenue growth over 2017-23* Biggest pipeline hopes hinge on new cancer drugs   (Adds further comment from CEO, 2016 and 2017 consensus forecasts, more on politics)By Ben HirschlerLONDON, May 6 AstraZeneca Plc laid out its defence against Pfizer Inc's $106-billion takeover approach on Tuesday by predicting its sales would rise by three quarters over the next decade, although only after a short-term drop.With promising new medicines expected to lift annual revenue above $45 billion by 2023, up from $25.7 billion in 2013, selling out to the U.S. group now would deprive investors of huge gains, it argued.""The increasingly visible success of our independent strategy highlights the future prospects for our shareholders,"" said Chairman Leif Johansson. ""These are benefits that should fully accrue to AstraZeneca's shareholders.""Chief Executive Pascal Soriot said plunging AstraZeneca into a disruptive merger would also jeopardise its ability to deliver on the new drug pipeline, which is expected to account for 30 percent of the 2023 sales total.Investors and analysts agree Britain's second-biggest drugmaker has an improving experimental portfolio in areas ranging from cancer to asthma, but they remain nervous about the uncertain commercial future of many products.AstraZeneca has rebuffed three approaches from Pfizer, which wants to create the world's biggest pharmaceuticals company - and cut its tax bill - by buying the group. It said on Friday that the U.S. firm's latest offer of 50 pounds a share ""substantially"" undervalued the company.The group has not ruled out a deal altogether, however, and people familiar with the matter said it was willing to talk if there were a compelling offer. Several large shareholders have told Reuters they would be open to a deal at a higher level.Shares in AstraZeneca were down 2.7 percent at 46.80 pounds at 1510 GMT. ""OVERLY OPTIMISTIC"" Sales are set to fall over the next three years as older medicines lose patent protection, slipping to $24.5 billion by 2016 and $23.6 billion in 2017, according to Thomson Reuters consensus analyst forecasts.AstraZeneca has previously said it disagrees with analysts and sees sales back up at last year's level by 2017. Now it is  forecasting ""strong and consistent"" growth from 2017 to 2023, driven by new treatments for cancer, diabetes, heart disease and lung disorders.It also flagged up a possible therapy for Alzheimer's disease, a notoriously high-risk area for drug development.Growth in core earnings per share, which excludes certain items, is expected to exceed revenue growth during this period, it added. Jefferies analysts said the forecasts appeared ""overly optimistic"" but the detailed product breakdown might help raise the price and cash mix in any deal. In addition to a higher bid, AstraZeneca also insists there should be more cash than the 32 percent suggested by Pfizer, with the balance paid in shares.AstraZeneca launched its 10-year sales forecast defence salvo a day after Pfizer CEO Ian Read renewed his call for the British company's board to enter talks.Read insisted his offer was ""compelling"" and signalled he was now weighing all options, including a possible hostile bid or looking at other targets, though he stressed that buying AstraZeneca remained ""Plan A"".Pfizer's pursuit of AstraZeneca has created a political stir in Britain, with critics of the U.S. group's approach fearing that a takeover will lead to big cuts in drug research, despite assurances given by Pfizer to the government.Officials have said a deal would be a commercial matter for the two companies but business minister Vince Cable said Britain could use its powers to assess if a takeover was in the public interest, while lawmakers called on Pfizer's bosses to appear before parliament. CANCER FOCUS Most investor interest centres on AstraZeneca's experimental cancer medicines designed to boost the immune system. Such drugs promise to revolutionise treatment of many tumour types and would also complement Pfizer's line-up of oncology medicines.But AstraZeneca is lagging rivals such as Bristol-Myers Squibb Co, Merck & Co and Roche Holding AG  in this field.""This is a company that has made significant progress in moving its pipeline forward over the last 18 months,"" said Alistair Campbell, an analyst at Berenberg Bank. ""Is it enough on a fundamental basis to justify the current share price? Personally, I don't think so - at least not without the certainty you need in terms of knowing clinical trial outcomes.""Among individual products, AstraZeneca said heart drug Brilinta had the potential to deliver annual sales of around $3.5 billion by 2023, with diabetes and respiratory medicines both adding about $8 billion apiece.In cancer it forecast potential peak sales of $6.5 billion for its experimental immunotherapy drug MEDI4736 - the product that has excited most interest from investors and analysts.AstraZeneca said last month it planned to push ahead with late-stage Phase III testing of MEDI4736, following evaluation of positive Phase I data that will be presented at an American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) conference on May 30-June 3.The detailed presentations on this and other experimental cancer medicines will be important for AstraZeneca and rivals, and could move its shares - but may be just too late for the Pfizer bid battle.Pfizer has a deadline of May 26 to make a firm offer or walk away under British ""put up or shut up"" takeover rules.""They've got drug candidates in what look to be really exciting areas,"" said Dan Mahony, a fund manager at Polar Capital, who raised his stake in AstraZeneca last year. ""But it is not clear to us yet who, across the industry, has the best drug.""

They are viewed as a promising new approach to fighting the memory-robbing condition and have taken center stage after an injectable class of medicines targeting beta-amyloid plaque failed or fell short in trials conducted by Pfizer and Eli Lilly.Merck & Co is currently in the lead in the BACE inhibitor field, with the first Phase III data from the U.S. company's program likely to emerge in around 2017.

It said the combined group would be able to expand its global research, speed up the development of treatments and broaden its footprint in emerging markets.A combined Pfizer-AstraZeneca would be the world's largest pharmaceuticals business and save Pfizer billions of dollars in taxes by shifting its domicile to Britain, although it would still be run out of New York.

141,"   By Ben Hirschler | LONDON  LONDON Ten-year sales forecasts from AstraZeneca (AZN.L) - a central plank of its defense against a $106 billion bid approach from Pfizer (PFE.N) - underscore how valuing drugs is an art as well as a science.While imponderables exist in any corporate valuation, pharmaceuticals are especially tricky, given the hazards of drug development and the long timelines of an industry where it typically takes 10 to 15 years to bring a new product to market.AstraZeneca's prediction of sales above $45 billion by 2023 was widely seen as over-optimistic by industry analysts who have a more conservative view on many of the myriad factors that feed into modeling future drug sales.One thing is certain: most experimental drugs fail.The average new drug has just a 6 percent chance of making it to market when it enters initial Phase I testing in humans, according to Thomson Reuters CMR International, which specializes in measuring pharmaceutical R&D performance.This rises to 69 percent by the time a new medicine reaches final Phase III clinical trials, and 90 percent once it is submitted for regulatory approval.""There will be things in our pipeline that won't work - that's par for the course,"" Briggs Morrison, AstraZeneca's global head of medicines development, said on Wednesday.Nonetheless, Morrison, who worked for Pfizer until 2012, believes his colleagues at AstraZeneca have honed the art of predicting future sales by blending the factors behind a new drug's commercial success.The first pass involves evaluating the technical aspects of whether a medicine actually works, followed by judging whether wary regulators are likely to give it a green light, and then finally assessing its likely market share and pricing. Given the many variables and the risk of over-promising and under-delivering, most drug companies prefer not to make long-term sales forecasts in normal times.But these are not normal times for AstraZeneca, and it hopes that by sharing key parts of its internal Long Range Plan, prepared for the board each year, it can prove it is worth a lot more than the 50 pounds per share offered by Pfizer.MOLECULAR ROULETTE For investors, pharmaceutical investment remains to a large degree a game of molecular roulette.Skimming through a 44-slide presentation on the new forecasts this week, AstraZeneca Chief Executive Pascal Soriot acknowledged the uncertainties but argued his group had one of the most compelling and visible pipelines in the industry. He compared his forecasts to those made by Genentech before it was acquired by Roche ROG.VX in 2009. In that case, the numbers were achieved, but the sales did not all come from the expected products.Overall, AstraZeneca believes its drug pipeline has a 36 percent chance of success, with potential peak annual sales of $63 billion translating to $23 billion on a risk-adjusted basis.But the success rate varies hugely from product to product.Alzheimer's drug AZD3293, which is about to enter Phase III testing and could in theory have annual sales of $5 billion, has a mere 9 percent probability of success, while the Phase III inhaled lung drug PT003 has a better than two-thirds chance.

That would mean asking regulators to judge whether the deal was in the national interest.""I absolutely agree with what the business secretary said yesterday but let me be clear, the most important intervention we can make is to back British jobs, British science, British R&D, British medicines and British technology,"" Cameron said.""The assessment that I want is from the business department on this deal,"" he added. ""I will judge all these things about does it expand British jobs, British investment, British science?""The opposition Labour party has called on Cameron to expand the provisions of the public interest test to allow ministers more power over any possible takeover of AstraZeneca, though any move to do so could face legal challenges.Just a year before a parliamentary election, those demands have increased the pressure on Cameron to be seen as tough on Pfizer while not discouraging foreign investment.Media reports that two advisers to Cameron had previously been paid by Pfizer were dismissed by the prime minister spokesman, who said there was ""nothing in"" them. SUGAR PILLS Imposing such a test could further complicate Read's bid - already twice rejected by AstraZeneca - to create the world's largest pharmaceuticals business and save Pfizer billions of dollars in taxes by shifting its domicile to Britain.Pfizer has sought to allay fears that the proposed takeover would deal a blow to drug research, saying the new company would bolster innovation and speed the development of new treatments.It said the combined group would be able to expand its global research, speed up the development of treatments and offer its products more widely in emerging markets.Read and AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot will appear before two parliamentary committees next week to explain the merger.""AstraZeneca is one of the bastions of the UK's world-leading pharmaceutical sector,"" said Labour lawmaker Andrew Miller, who chairs the science and technology committee.""Next week's hearing will be an opportunity for us to scrutinise the pledges on research and development being made as part of this potential takeover and pose questions about how the government will ensure that these commitments are met.""AstraZeneca itself has already made large cutbacks as it has struggled to sustain profits in the face of a wave of patent expiries and past lack of success in its research laboratories.It announced plans to shutter its Charnwood research and development centre in central England in 2010, a year before Pfizer's decided to close most of its drug research at Sandwich.AstraZeneca's planned move to a new site in Cambridge will also involve further job losses, with the number of R&D posts in Britain expected to fall by around 400 to 2,200 by 2016.

While five-year CDS on AstraZeneca have tightened 21% in the past month,  Pfizer's CDS have widened 28%. 'Credit protection for both pharmaceutical giants  is still pricing strong, though market sentiment appears to be improving for  AstraZeneca and souring for Pfizer,' said Director Diana Allmendinger.Part of the reason may be AstraZeneca's announced aggressive revenue targets in  an effort to ward off a potential Pfizer takeover.  Conversely, 'the markets are  anticipating that Pfizer would likely have to take on debt to acquire  AstraZeneca, which would stress its leverage ratios,' said Allmendinger. Fitch Solutions case studies build on data from its CDS Pricing Service and  proprietary quantitative models, including CDS Implied Ratings. These credit  risk indicators are designed to provide real-time, market-based views of  creditworthiness. As such, they can and often do reflect more short term market  views on factors such as currencies, seasonal market effects and short-term  technical influences.

157,"  * Up 2 percent on speculation of 53 stg-plus a share offer* AstraZeneca meeting shareholders to canvass views   (Adds AstraZeneca talking to shareholders, analyst comment, Investor holding)By Sudip Kar-Gupta and Ben HirschlerLONDON, May 8 AstraZeneca shares gained 2 percent on Thursday on speculation that U.S. drugmaker Pfizer  was about to return with a higher bid worth more than 53 pounds ($89.9) a share, traders said.A bid at that level would value Britain's second-biggest pharmaceuticals group at around $113 billion.Pfizer's pursuit of AstraZeneca in potentially the biggest ever foreign takeover of a British firm has provoked a political storm, with Prime Minister David Cameron demanding Pfizer give stronger guarantees it will keep jobs and investment in the country. Pfizer's previous approach, which was promptly rejected by the AstraZeneca board, initially valued the group at $106 billion - but the value of that cash-and-stock offer has since slipped because of a fall in Pfizer shares following weak quarterly results.A stock market report in the Daily Mail newspaper said many investors believed Pfizer was working with its advisers on a ""knockout offer"" of more than 53 pounds per share that would be made by the weekend.""The deal is not there, but it's not off the table either,"" Dafydd Davies, senior trader at London-based Prime Wealth Group, said. Pfizer Chief Executive Ian Read is heading to London next week to lay out his case for a merger in front of two parliamentary committees on May 13 and 14.A Pfizer spokesman had no comment on the company's bid plans.Investors are betting that a deal will get done, despite the political noise. ""One way or another, I think the deal will go ahead,"" said Beaufort Securities sales trader Basil Petrides. Analysts at Barclays, who believe Pfizer could make the deal pay at any price up to 56 pounds a share, said in a note to clients last Friday that AstraZeneca shares could fall 21 percent if the U.S. company walked away.AstraZeneca laid out a defence strategy on Tuesday by flagging up the potential of a range of promising experimental medicines that it said would boost sales by three quarters over the next decade.Chief Executive Pascal Soriot and his management team are now following up with a series of meetings with leading shareholders to get their feedback. The British group has not ruled out a deal altogether and people familiar with the matter said it was willing to talk if there was a compelling offer.Soriot, who is credited with reviving the company's drug pipeline, has won the support of a number of investors, including leading shareholder Investor, which owns 4.1 percent and has had a stake in legacy firm Astra since 1924. Investor's Marcus Wallenberg also sits on the drugmaker's board.Several other large shareholders, however, have told Reuters they would favour engagement with Pfizer to secure a higher offer.

158,"   By Ben Hirschler | LONDON  LONDON U.S. drugmaker Pfizer (PFE.N) is under fire on both sides of the Atlantic as it weighs its next move to buy British rival AstraZeneca (AZN.L), which could be a sweetened offer next week.A strategic question for Pfizer and its advisers is whether to come back with a new bid before bosses from both companies are grilled by UK lawmakers on May 13-14, or wait until the end of the week.Two people familiar with the matter said on Friday it would be more ""polite"" for Pfizer to explain its current position to the two parliamentary committees before pushing out a new offer.The New York-based company's record of slashing jobs after a string of earlier mergers has provoked a political backlash against the proposed $106 billion takeover at home and in Britain, with two U.S. state governors joining the fray on Thursday.Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley and Delaware Governor Jack Markell wrote to Pfizer Chief Executive Officer Ian Read ""expressing deep concerns"" about the planned deal, given the fact that AstraZeneca employs 5,700 people in the two states.Many in the United States fear Pfizer's promise to Britain that the combined company would keep 20 percent of its research and development workforce in the country will inevitably jeopardize American jobs.It is the same fear that agitates politicians in Sweden, where Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt said his country had already had ""negative experiences"" with Pfizer after it failed to honor promises on jobs following its 2002 acquisition of Pharmacia. In Britain, however, there are concerns that Pfizer's vows leave too much room for it to renege on its promises, and Prime Minister David Cameron, who initially welcomed Pfizer's ""robust"" assurances, now wants more commitments.Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said on Friday that the government needed to be confident about any such promises. ""Our focus is to make sure that, if the companies decide to proceed, the commitments ... are serious ones, are durable ones, and are ones that will stick,"" he said at a Reuters newsmaker event in London.There is also growing disquiet about Pfizer's desire to reincorporate in Britain to cut its tax bill, with U.S. Democratic senators weighing legislation to prevent such tax ""inversions"". ASTRAZENECA ROADSHOW AstraZeneca has rejected successive approaches from its larger American rival and Chief Executive Pascal Soriot is now on a roadshow with advisers to meet dozens of leading investors and lay out his strategy for a prosperous independent future.Soriot has secured the backing of several high-profile shareholders but others have told Reuters they would like him to engage with Pfizer if the U.S. group makes an improved offer.Shares in AstraZeneca, which rallied nearly 2 percent on Thursday on talk that an improved bid might be imminent, fell back 1.8 percent on Friday afternoon.

159,"  * Pfizer may delay any new bid until after meeting UK lawmakers* State governors worried about losing American jobs* Any Pfizer promises must be ""ones that will stick"" - Clegg* Collapse of ad agency merger a different case - sourceBy Ben HirschlerLONDON, May 9 U.S. drugmaker Pfizer is under fire on both sides of the Atlantic as it weighs its next move to buy British rival AstraZeneca, which could be a sweetened offer next week.A strategic question for Pfizer and its advisers is whether to come back with a new bid before bosses from both companies are grilled by UK lawmakers on May 13-14, or wait until the end of the week.Two people familiar with the matter said on Friday it would be more ""polite"" for Pfizer to explain its current position to the two parliamentary committees before pushing out a new offer.The New York-based company's record of slashing jobs after a string of earlier mergers has provoked a political backlash against the proposed $106 billion takeover at home and in Britain, with two U.S. state governors joining the fray on Thursday. Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley and Delaware Governor Jack Markell wrote to Pfizer Chief Executive Officer Ian Read ""expressing deep concerns"" about the planned deal, given the fact that AstraZeneca employs 5,700 people in the two states.Many in the United States fear Pfizer's promise to Britain that the combined company would keep 20 percent of its research and development workforce in the country will inevitably jeopardise American jobs.It is the same fear that agitates politicians in Sweden, where Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt said his country had already had ""negative experiences"" with Pfizer after it failed to honour promises on jobs following its 2002 acquisition of Pharmacia.In Britain, however, there are concerns that Pfizer's vows leave too much room for it to renege on its promises, and Prime Minister David Cameron, who initially welcomed Pfizer's ""robust"" assurances, now wants more commitments.Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said on Friday that the government needed to be confident about any such promises. ""Our focus is to make sure that, if the companies decide to proceed, the commitments ... are serious ones, are durable ones, and are ones that will stick,"" he said at a Reuters newsmaker event in London. There is also growing disquiet about Pfizer's desire to reincorporate in Britain to cut its tax bill, with U.S. Democratic senators weighing legislation to prevent such tax ""inversions"".ASTRAZENECA ROADSHOW  AstraZeneca has rejected successive approaches from its larger American rival and Chief Executive Pascal Soriot is now on a roadshow with advisers to meet dozens of leading investors and lay out his strategy for a prosperous independent future.Soriot has secured the backing of several high-profile shareholders but others have told Reuters they would like him to engage with Pfizer if the U.S. group makes an improved offer.Shares in AstraZeneca, which rallied nearly 2 percent on Thursday on talk that an improved bid might be imminent, fell back 1.8 percent on Friday afternoon.""I can't see there being much movement from these levels until there's more clarity on Pfizer's intentions,"" said Central Markets trading analyst Joe Neighbour.The collapse of a $35 billion merger between advertising giants Omnicom and Publicis has added some uncertainty around the proposed giant pharmaceutical deal.The Omnicom-Publicis tie-up would also have involved an advantageous change of tax residence but faced a series of problems, including anti-trust hurdles in China, which may also snag Pfizer.The deals are, however, fundamentally different.

""So one way of doing that is to consolidate and is to take out overlapping functions.""Under British takeover rules, Pfizer has until May 26 to make a firm bid for AstraZeneca or walk away.That puts pressure on Read and his team to get a deal signed quickly and many investors believe Pfizer is likely return next week with an improved offer of more than 53 pounds a share - including a larger cash element - in an attempt to get AstraZeneca to the negotiating table.""There is a lot of speculation about another bid coming,"" Osborne said in a BBC radio interview.Pfizer has a tarnished reputation in Britain after it announced plans in 2011 to shut a major drug research site in Sandwich, southern England, where Viagra was invented, with the loss of some 1,700 jobs.But the company is also working with many academic scientists in the country and on Friday signed a deal with top universities on research into rare diseases.(Editing by Andrew Heavens and Toby Chopra)",2014-05-10,PFE,"Sat May 10, 2014 | 10:59am EDT","UPDATE 1-Under fire, Pfizer hits back as weighs next Astra move",http://www.reuters.com//article/astrazeneca-pfizer-read-idUSL6N0NW0EC20140510?type=companyNews

178,"  * Most marketed and pipeline drugs invented elsewhere* Global drug companies agnostic in sourcing best science* $106 bln Pfizer bid stirs up political storm on job fearsBy Ben HirschlerLONDON, May 11 How British is AstraZeneca? With a French chief executive, Swedish chairman, 40 percent of its sales in the United States and 87 percent of its staff overseas, the answer is not simple.Formed from an Anglo-Swedish merger 15 years ago, even its roots are only half British. Yet a $106 billion takeover bid from U.S. group Pfizer has forced politicians at Westminster to line up in defence of British jobs and science.The pharmaceuticals group, which is fighting the approach, is an important science anchor for Britain and has close ties to top universities. However, it gets a dwindling portion of medicines from its UK laboratories.That reflects the realities of the modern drugs industry, in which companies chase the best science, regardless of geography.Of the top 10 medicines sold by AstraZeneca, three - all for cancer - were invented in its labs near Manchester, four came from Sweden, one from its U.S. research site, one from the U.S. biotech industry and one from Japan.The Japanese drug, cholesterol fighter Crestor, was acquired from Shionogi and is now the group's biggest seller. Future drug sales will rely even less on its British lab work. Only one of the 13 experimental medicines in the pipeline that AstraZeneca management highlighted when it laid out its defence was invented in-house.The rest flow from acquisitions and licensing deals that AstraZeneca has struck in recent years with U.S. companies such as Pearl Therapeutics, FibroGen and Amgen, as well as some smaller British biotech firms.Many of the most promising new drugs come from the Maryland-based biotech business MedImmune, which AstraZeneca acquired for $15.6 billion in 2007 in a deal that was slammed at the time by investors as a waste of money.""It is difficult to really pinpoint the nationality of a drug company today,"" said Patrick Flochel, global pharmaceutical sector leader at Ernst & Young.""Is it where it was originally born or the language they speak or where it is headquartered or where it pays most of its taxes or where most of the employees come from? In many ways, pharma companies are more American than anything else because that's the biggest market."" Pfizer's attempt to pull off the largest foreign takeover of a British company has created a political storm. Many scientists and some politicians have said its record of slashing jobs after previous deals will undermine a vital high-tech sector.Pharmaceuticals is one area where Britain punches above its weight. Despite accounting for just over 2 percent of the global drugs market, it is responsible for a tenth of research and development expenditure.FIVE-YEAR PLEDGE  Pfizer CEO Ian Read has made a five-year promise to complete a research centre that AstraZeneca plans to build in Cambridge, retain a big factory in the northwestern English town of Macclesfield and put a fifth of its research staff in Britain.But five years is not long in an industry with 10 to 15 year product cycles, and Pfizer has also said it could adjust its promises if circumstances change ""significantly"", prompting government demands for more binding commitments.There are reasons for concern about jobs. The past decade has seen a wave of cutbacks across the pharmaceuticals industry, with Pfizer responsible for many of the deepest cuts after swallowing smaller rivals such as Wyeth, Warner-Lambert and Pharmacia.AstraZeneca, too, has wielded the knife regularly. The group was formed in 1999 by the merger of Sweden's Astra and Britain's Zeneca, which was itself created in 1993 by the break-up of Imperial Chemical Industries, for many years the bellwether of the British economy.After expanding staff numbers from 2000 to 2007, AstraZeneca's headcount has shrunk every year since 2008, reflecting its difficulties in finding enough new drugs to replace those going off patent.It now employs 51,500 people worldwide, 6,700 of them in Britain - a far smaller ratio of local to international staff than at British bank Barclays, which last week announced 19,000 job cuts in a workforce that is roughly half British-based.AstraZeneca's planned move to its new state-of-the-art site in Cambridge will also involve further job losses, with the number of research and development posts in Britain expected to fall by around 400 to 2,200 by 2016.""The changes we have made globally and in the UK to the shape and size of our organisation over the recent years are part of the transformation of AstraZeneca to ensure the business is fit for future growth and sustainable success,"" a company spokeswoman said.Amidst the growing political controversy on both sides of the Atlantic, Pfizer is weighing its next move, which could be a sweetened offer for AstraZeneca in the coming week.

""Looming patent expiries and near term revenue losses jeopardise its ability to deliver on its very promising pipeline,"" Pfizer said in a written submission to a parliamentary committee.Pfizer's Scottish-born Chief Executive Ian Read faces tough questions from British lawmakers on Tuesday about his plans to acquire AstraZeneca - a deal driven in large part by Pfizer's wish to cut its tax bill.Lawmakers will also interrogate AstraZeneca's French CEO Pascal Soriot and business minister Vince Cable on Tuesday. Then a second parliamentary committee on May 14 will question both CEOs again, along with British science minister David Willetts, about the science aspects of the deal.In response to worries about safeguarding the British company's research, Pfizer's R&D head Mikael Dolsten posted a video on Pfizer's website saying he had been through five different mergers which did not disrupt drug research.""If you keep your sense of curiosity and an open mind, you can learn tremendously,"" he said.""We must stay laser-focused on our important projects. And that's, of course, true for Pfizer scientists and AZ scientists and will be true also if we can make a potential combination come together."" Dolsten said there was ""a really great fit"" with the products that AstraZeneca had in its portfolio, with potential for combining drugs in areas such as lung cancer to offer much more effective treatments.There is considerable scepticism about Pfizer's long-term commitment to British jobs, given its record of cost cutting after past acquisitions and after it said it could adjust those promises if circumstances change ""significantly.""But Pfizer said the fact it had made the promises as part of its offer made them legally binding and the pledges should be given ""full weight"".Prime Minister David Cameron said on Sunday he had made ""very good progress"" in securing guarantees from Pfizer, though the firm's latest statements contained no new offers. SWEETENED OFFER? Pfizer is widely expected to come back with a sweetened offer for AstraZeneca this week, though people familiar with the matter said it was likely to wait until after the parliamentary select committee hearings.The British group rejected a May 2 cash-and-stock offer worth 50 pounds a share from its larger American rival, and CEO Soriot has been on a roadshow to meet leading investors and lay out his strategy for a prosperous independent future.Soriot has secured the backing of several high-profile shareholders, but others have told Reuters they would like him to engage with Pfizer if the U.S. group makes an improved offer.In addition to wanting a higher price - many analysts think Pfizer will have to offer around 55 pounds a share - investors are also keen to increase the proportion of cash in any deal from 32 percent at present.Pfizer is limited in the amount of cash it can offer since in order to keep the tax advantages of re-domiciling to Britain it must ensure at least 20 percent of the enlarged group is British-owned.Under British takeover rules, Pfizer has until May 26 to make a firm bid for AstraZeneca or walk away.A slide in Pfizer's share price following its first-quarter results last week has reduced the current value of its May 2 offer to just under 48 pounds. AstraZeneca shares traded 0.3 percent higher at 46.15 pounds by 1115 GMT.Pfizer has a tarnished reputation in Britain after shutting down most of its drug research in Sandwich, southern England, where Viagra was invented, with the loss of some 1,700 jobs.

However, it gets a dwindling portion of medicines from its UK laboratories.That reflects the realities of the modern drugs industry, in which companies chase the best science, regardless of geography.Of the top 10 medicines sold by AstraZeneca, three - all for cancer - were invented in its labs near Manchester, four came from Sweden, one from its U.S. research site, one from the U.S. biotech industry and one from Japan. The Japanese drug, cholesterol fighter Crestor, was acquired from Shionogi and is now the group's biggest seller.Future drug sales will rely even less on its British lab work. Only one of the 13 experimental medicines in the pipeline that AstraZeneca management highlighted when it laid out its defence was invented in-house.The rest flow from acquisitions and licensing deals that AstraZeneca has struck in recent years with U.S. companies such as Pearl Therapeutics, FibroGen and Amgen, as well as some smaller British biotech firms.Many of the most promising new drugs come from the Maryland-based biotech business MedImmune, which AstraZeneca acquired for $15.6 billion in 2007 in a deal that was slammed at the time by investors as a waste of money.""It is difficult to really pinpoint the nationality of a drug company today,"" said Patrick Flochel, global pharmaceutical sector leader at Ernst & Young. ""Is it where it was originally born or the language they speak or where it is headquartered or where it pays most of its taxes or where most of the employees come from? In many ways, pharma companies are more American than anything else because that's the biggest market.""Pfizer's attempt to pull off the largest foreign takeover of a British company has created a political storm. Many scientists and some politicians have said its record of slashing jobs after previous deals will undermine a vital high-tech sector.Pharmaceuticals is one area where Britain punches above its weight. Despite accounting for just over 2 percent of the global drugs market, it is responsible for a tenth of research and development expenditure.FIVE-YEAR PLEDGE  Pfizer CEO Ian Read has made a five-year promise to complete a research centre that AstraZeneca plans to build in Cambridge, retain a big factory in the northwestern English town of Macclesfield and put a fifth of its research staff in Britain.But five years is not long in an industry with 10 to 15 year product cycles, and Pfizer has also said it could adjust its promises if circumstances change ""significantly"", prompting government demands for more binding commitments.There are reasons for concern about jobs. The past decade has seen a wave of cutbacks across the pharmaceuticals industry, with Pfizer responsible for many of the deepest cuts after swallowing smaller rivals such as Wyeth, Warner-Lambert and Pharmacia.AstraZeneca, too, has wielded the knife regularly. The group was formed in 1999 by the merger of Sweden's Astra and Britain's Zeneca, which was itself created in 1993 by the break-up of Imperial Chemical Industries, for many years the bellwether of the British economy.After expanding staff numbers from 2000 to 2007, AstraZeneca's headcount has shrunk every year since 2008, reflecting its difficulties in finding enough new drugs to replace those going off patent.It now employs 51,500 people worldwide, 6,700 of them in Britain - a far smaller ratio of local to international staff than at British bank Barclays, which last week announced 19,000 job cuts in a workforce that is roughly half British-based.AstraZeneca's planned move to its new state-of-the-art site in Cambridge will also involve further job losses, with the number of research and development posts in Britain expected to fall by around 400 to 2,200 by 2016.""The changes we have made globally and in the UK to the shape and size of our organisation over the recent years are part of the transformation of AstraZeneca to ensure the business is fit for future growth and sustainable success,"" a company spokeswoman said.Amidst the growing political controversy on both sides of the Atlantic, Pfizer is weighing its next move, which could be a sweetened offer for AstraZeneca in the coming week.

186,"   By Ben Hirschler | LONDON  LONDON May 14 Pfizer faces calls to extend its commitment to UK jobs and research to least 10 years as the U.S. drugmaker's boss prepares for a second day of questioning from lawmakers over its plan to buy AstraZeneca .After an initial grilling in which Chief Executive Ian Read admitted a merger would mean job losses and reduced research spending, Read returns for another session of tough questioning by a parliamentary science committee on Wednesday.Pfizer has indicated it could raise its offer for Britain's second-biggest drugmaker from $106 billion, if AstraZeneca is prepared to talk, but lawmakers are deeply concerned about the impact of a takeover on the country's science base.The U.S. company has a record of making deep job cuts after past takeover of companies like Wyeth, Warner-Lambert and Pharmacia.On Tuesday, the chairman of the business committee, Adrian Bailey, said Pfizer had been called a ""praying mantis"" and a ""shark that needs feeding"", and he asked Read: ""What can you say to this committee to convince us that this is a leopard that has changed its spots?"" That critical tone is likely to be carried over into the second day of hearings, when the lawmakers will focus on the  concerns of the scientific community, which has had close ties with AstraZeneca and its legacy companies for decades.Nobel laureate Paul Nurse, the president of the Royal Society and one of Britain's top scientists, wrote to the chairman of the science committee Andrew Miller to express his concern that Pfizer's promises so far were vague and inadequate. Pfizer has given a five-year commitment to complete AstraZeneca's new research centre in Cambridge, retain a factory in the northwestern English town of Macclesfield and put a fifth of its research staff in Britain if the deal goes ahead.But it has also said this could be altered if circumstances change ""significantly"" and Scottish-born Read said he could not commit to maintaining a specific R&D budget for Britain.Nurse said a five-year pledge was simply not good enough. ""A five-year commitment to the UK is insufficient. A commitment of at least 10 years is required. Science is not a quick win,"" he wrote.AstraZeneca has rejected Pfizer's cash-and-stock offer, which was worth 50 pounds a share at the time it was made on May 2, arguing that it has a bright future as an independent business, with a pipeline of promising new drugs.The British company's French-born CEO Pascal Soriot said Pfizer's proposal not only undervalued his company but risked disrupting its research and delaying getting life-saving new drugs to market.Parliamentary select committees cannot block corporate transactions but they can question executives ferociously, as banks, energy companies and Rupert Murdoch's News Corp  have all found out in the past.

187,"   By Ben Hirschler and Kate Holton | LONDON  LONDON U.S. drugmaker Pfizer hinted it could raise its proposed $106 billion offer if AstraZeneca would only engage in talks, as its boss was grilled by UK lawmakers on his commitment to British research spending and jobs.In response AstraZeneca said it would have to consider a compelling offer but accused Pfizer of an ""opportunistic"" proposal and a ploy to cut taxes that risked its reputation.Pascal Soriot, the French-born boss of AstraZeneca, came out fighting after Pfizer's Chief Executive Ian Read made clear the New York-based group would not rule out a hostile bid if Britain's second-biggest drugmaker did not enter merger talks.Having warned that AstraZeneca could wither without its financial muscle, Pfizer expressed its frustration at being rebuffed, and said on Tuesday that working with the UK company's board could help deliver ""optimal deal terms"" which AstraZeneca could recommend to its shareholders.Soriot - who appeared after Read to answer questions from a parliamentary select committee - said Pfizer's proposal risked disrupting its research and delaying getting life-saving new drugs to market, as well as undervaluing the business.""What will we tell the person whose father died from lung cancer because one of our medicines was delayed - and essentially was delayed because in the meantime our two companies were involved in saving tax and saving costs?"" he asked.Pfizer's plan to cut its tax bill by re-domiciling to Britain if it buys AstraZeneca also posed a reputational risk, Soriot added.""The proposed tax inversion structure, we are afraid, could generate substantial controversy and potentially delay this merger and potentially impact the reputation of our company.""AstraZeneca rejected Pfizer's May 2 cash-and-stock offer worth 50 pounds a share and said it had a bright future as an independent business. But by early afternoon on Tuesday its shares had risen 2 percent to 47 pounds on anticipation it would have to consider a second proposal. ""If Pfizer continues to aggressively pursue the deal by raising the price, then AstraZeneca's board would have to little choice but to engage,"" said Ketan Patel, analyst at Ecclesiastical Investment Management, a holder of AstraZeneca shares.Pfizer is expected to come back with a sweetened offer for AstraZeneca this week, although people with knowledge of the matter said it would likely wait until after the parliamentary hearings. Both chief executives, who gave confident performances, will appear before another panel on Wednesday to answer questions about the science aspects of the deal.PUBLIC INTEREST Pfizer's bid would be the largest foreign takeover of a British firm and is opposed by many scientists and politicians who fear it will undermine Britain's science base.Parliamentary select committees cannot block corporate transactions but they can question executives ferociously, as banks, energy companies and Rupert Murdoch's News Corp have all found out: The media coverage resulting from these sessions confirmed them as corporate bad guys for much of the public and placed future dealings under even closer scrutiny. British business minister Vince Cable told the panel Pfizer's assurances on jobs, research and manufacturing had to be meaningful and binding or the government could take action.""When we are talking to the companies about assurances, they have to understand that as a government we would under certain circumstances consider intervention,"" he said, though he added that doing this using public interest rules was ""quite tricky"" and would have to comply with European merger law.Pfizer has a tarnished reputation in Britain after shutting down most of its research in southern England where Viagra was invented, with the loss of some 1,700 jobs.Now it faces skepticism about its long-term commitment to AstraZeneca, though Read told the panel: ""I'm a man of my word.""Pfizer has given a five-year commitment to complete AstraZeneca's new research centre in Cambridge, retain a factory in the northwestern English town of Macclesfield and put a fifth of its research staff in Britain if the deal goes ahead. Having pledged to keep a fifth of research jobs in Britain, Scottish-born Read said he could not commit to maintaining a specific R&D budget there.""We'll be efficient by some reduction in jobs. What I cannot tell you is how much or how many or where. We'll look at this as our global combined footprint and then we'll make decisions,"" Read said.He told the panel he expected the combined research expenditure of the merged drugmaker would be lower than that of the two separate companies, noting one of the drivers of his proposed deal was to increase efficiency to keep both firms competitive in an increasingly tough marketplace.WRONG PRESCRIPTION Allan Black, national officer for the GMB trade union, told the select committee: ""The lawyers we've consulted don't see any obvious mechanism to make a five-year commitment binding.""Tony Burke, Assistant General Secretary of Unite, the UK's biggest trade union, said members were ""very, very concerned"" about Pfizer's record of cutting 65,000 jobs worldwide since 2005.AstraZeneca pushed out details on its new drug pipeline late Monday and early Tuesday morning, flagging good news on drugs for asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus and diabetes to prove it can stand on its own.Unite ran an advertisement in the country's biggest free morning newspaper Metro on Tuesday, saying Pfizer was ""the wrong prescription for Britain.""(With additional reporting by William James; Editing by Sophie Walker)",2014-05-13,PFE,"Tue May 13, 2014 | 1:03pm EDT",UK lawmakers give Pfizer stick as it waves carrot at AstraZeneca,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-astrazeneca-pfizer-idUSBREA3R0H520140513?type=companyNews

199,"   By Deena Beasley  Britain's AstraZeneca Plc, the target of a $106 billion takeover effort by Pfizer Inc, released promising data on Wednesday for a new lung cancer treatment targeting a genetic mutation that helps tumors evade current treatments.The drug, known as AZD9291, in an early-stage trial shrank tumors in 51 percent of patients. Tumors shrank in 64 percent of patients found to have the mutation, known as T790M, which develops in about half of lung cancers that become resistant to drugs known as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors.These drugs, such as Roche's Tarceva, or erlotinib,  are used to treat various solid tumor cancers with mutated or overactive EGFR. Around 15 percent of patients with non-small cell lung cancer, the most common form of the disease, have mutations in the EGFR gene.But most of them will eventually become resistant to available EGFR inhibitors, said Dr. Pasi Janne, professor of medicine at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School in Boston and the study's lead investigator.""The issue of drug resistance has been the bane of chemotherapy treatment of cancer for decades,"" Dr Peter Yu, president-elect of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,  said during a press conference. Research that has enabled a better understanding of the molecular underpinnings of cancer is now extending to development of drugs that target new mutations, he said.AZD9291 is one of several new drugs flagged by AstraZeneca last week in a bid to convince investors of the strength of its experimental pipeline, one of its key attractions for Pfizer. AstraZeneca has so far rebuffed the approaches from its rival.[ID:nL6N0O05HX] The British company forecasts that peak annual sales of the cancer drug could reach $3 billion, which is more than the $1 billion to $2 billion currently predicted by analysts.The Phase 1 trial, featured ahead of the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) later this month, involved 199 patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer with EGFR mutations whose disease worsened despite treatment with a current EGFR inhibitor. The most common side effects seen in the trial included diarrhea and rash, but researchers said the level of toxicity was less severe than is seen with available EGFR inhibitors. AstraZeneca is currently conducting a Phase 2 study of AZN9291 in patients with the T790M mutation at a daily dose of 80 milligram, which it said could enable accelerated regulatory filing in the second half of next year.AZN9192 has been granted ""breakthrough"" status by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as a second-line therapy for non-small cell lung cancer. Astra has said it will also study the drug as an initial treatment for eligible lung cancer patients.Investors are keen to get a look at other cancer data from Astra due to be presented at the ASCO meeting. The company's MEDI4736 has the potential to become one of the first in a new class of drugs known as anti-PDL1 treatments that fight cancer by boosting the immune system.

202,"   By Ben Hirschler and Paul Sandle | LONDON  LONDON Pfizer (PFE.N) said it would ringfence the development of important drugs if it acquired AstraZeneca (AZN.L), rejecting a charge from the British company that a takeover would disrupt important research and put lives at risk.""As we put these companies together, we will continue with our pipeline, AZ will continue with theirs,"" Pfizer's Chief Executive Ian Read told lawmakers on a second day of questioning about what could be the biggest ever UK corporate deal.""We would ringfence any important products and they would continue to be developed. There is absolutely no truth to any comment that some products of critical nature would be delayed getting to patients, if anything we would accelerate that to patients.""AstraZeneca said on Tuesday that Pfizer's proposal risked disrupting its research and delaying getting life-saving new drugs to market, as well as undervaluing the business.""What will we tell the person whose father died from lung cancer because one of our medicines was delayed - and essentially was delayed because in the meantime our two companies were involved in saving tax and saving costs?"" the British company's Chief Executive Pascal Soriot said on Tuesday.On a second day in Parliament focused on the concerns of the science community, Read faced calls from a committee of lawmakers and other speakers for Pfizer to extend its commitment to UK jobs and research from five years to 10 or more.""I would like to see a longer period than that (five years),"" science minister David Willetts told the committee.British Prime Minister David Cameron said he was seeking the best possible guarantees from Pfizer. ""This government has been absolutely clear that the right thing to do is get stuck in to seek the best possible guarantees on British jobs, on British investment, and British science,"" he told lawmakers in parliament on Wednesday.The U.S. boss had earlier defended his five-year horizon, saying it was enough time to select medicines that had the greatest chance of approval and the biggest opportunity to meet the needs of patients.Pfizer had changed its R&D strategy to avoid lengthy, and ultimately fruitless, research by bringing in commercial and development expertise at the proof of concept stage in the assessment of experimental drugs, he said.""It's very important for me for productivity to ... hold (scientists) accountable, to say 'I'm allocating you capital on a five-year period and I'm going to review that on five-year periods',"" he said. Pfizer has indicated it could raise its offer for Britain's second-biggest drugmaker from $106 billion, if AstraZeneca is prepared to talk, but lawmakers are deeply concerned about the impact of a takeover on the country's science base.The U.S. company has a record of making deep job cuts after past takeovers of companies including Wyeth, Warner-Lambert and Pharmacia.FEWER SCIENTISTS Read said on Wednesday there would likely be fewer scientists in a newly combined company than currently work in the two firms, but he declined to put any numbers on it. Nobel laureate Paul Nurse, the president of the Royal Society, Britain's national academy of science, wrote to the chairman of Parliament's science committee Andrew Miller to express his concern that Pfizer's promises so far were vague and inadequate.Pfizer's five-year commitment includes completing AstraZeneca's new research center in Cambridge, retaining a factory in the northwestern English town of Macclesfield and putting a fifth of its research staff in Britain if the deal goes ahead.But it has also said this could be altered if circumstances changed ""significantly"" and Scottish-born Read said he could not commit to maintaining a specific R&D budget for Britain.Nurse said a five-year pledge was simply not good enough.""A five-year commitment to the UK is insufficient. A commitment of at least 10 years is required. Science is not a quick win,"" he wrote.AstraZeneca has rejected Pfizer's cash-and-stock offer, which was worth 50 pounds a share at the time it was made on May 2, arguing it has a bright future as an independent business, with a pipeline of promising new drugs.So-called Parliamentary select committees cannot block corporate transactions but they can question executives ferociously, as banks, energy companies and Rupert Murdoch's News Corp (NWSA.O) have all found out in the past.(Additional reporting by William James; Editing by Mark Potter, Greg Mahlich)",2014-05-14,PFE,"Wed May 14, 2014 | 4:25pm EDT",Pfizer pledges to ringfence key new drugs in AstraZeneca deal,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-astrazeneca-pfizer-idUSBREA3R0H520140514?type=companyNews

Pfizer is widely expected to return with a sweetened offer in coming days.""We continue to build our pipeline and we are encouraged by the progress in the development of key assets,"" Chief Executive Pascal Soriot said in a statement.Its new lung cancer drug, known as AZD9291, targets a genetic mutation that helps tumors evade current treatments. AstraZeneca believes it could sell as much as $3 billion a year.Results from an early-stage Phase I trial of the drug, released late on Wednesday, showed AZD9291 shrank tumors in 51 percent of patients.

213,"  (Adds analyst comment, background; updates shares)By Bill BerkrotMay 16 Pfizer Inc, which is in the process of trying to acquire British rival AstraZeneca  for more than $100 billion, on Friday said it planned to file for U.S. approval for palbociclib, its experimental drug for advanced breast cancer, in the third quarter.The largest U.S. drugmaker said it made the decision to submit its application to the Food and Drug Administration following discussions with the regulatory agency about the results of a midstage clinical trial.Morningstar analyst Damien Conover said he believed Pfizer may be looking to strengthen its position in negotiations with AstraZeneca by showcasing its own cancer drugs, although he had considered an FDA filing based on the Phase II data a strong possibility. The strength of AstraZeneca's portfolio of experimental cancer medicines has been cited as one of the reasons Pfizer wants to acquire the company, and has been a centerpiece of the case Astra has made in seeking a significantly higher offer.AstraZeneca has rejected a $106 billion approach from its larger U.S. rival. Pfizer is widely expected to raise its cash and stock bid for Astra ahead of a May 26 deadline under UK law.Palbociclib had received the FDA's new breakthrough designation given to help speed up the approval process for potentially important new medicines. Pfizer presented data from the trial at a cancer meeting last month. Patients in the study who took the experimental Pfizer medicine plus the hormone drug letrozole went 20.2 months on average before their cancer began to worsen, compared with 10.2 months for those that received only letrozole.Palbociclib is considered to be one of the most important medicines in Pfizer's developmental pipeline. A rival drug is also being developed by Eli Lilly and Co, which several analysts have said appears promising. Morningstar's Conover forecast peak sales of more than $2 billion for palbociclib and gives the drug a 70 percent chance of approval based on the current data.He also noted that potential rival drugs from Lilly and Swiss drugmaker Novartis lag behind Pfizer in the development process.""Pfizer will have the first mover advantage, which is pretty significant, especially in cancer,"" Conover said.Pfizer shares were up 0.5 percent at $29.19 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

AstraZeneca's chief executive has not ruled out discussions at the right price.Pfizer has given a five-year promise to have 20 percent of its research staff in Britain, where AstraZeneca has its headquarters, but it has not spelt out what this means in absolute numbers.At the same time, the U.S. company has said that the overall research budget of a merged group would be lower than the sum of the two companies' individual research budgets. The numbers suggest Sweden is right to be worried.Pfizer currently has around 11,000 staff working in research worldwide, while AstraZeneca has 9,000, and the two companies together employ 3,450 in Britain - 2,600 at AstraZeneca and 850 at Pfizer - representing 17.25 percent of the combined total.But AstraZeneca plans to shed 400 research posts by 2016 as it moves to a new site in Cambridge, suggesting that research centers in Sweden and the United States will have to take a larger share of future job cuts if Pfizer is to hit its 20 percent target.In Sweden, AstraZeneca employs 5,900 people, of whom 2,200 work in research and development (R&D), representing 25 percent of the independent company's R&D total. Borg and Bjorklund said they had spoken to the British government about their concerns that the deal was largely motivated by tax and cost cutting priorities. They also pointed to the experience of Pfizer buying Pharmacia, which led to big research cutbacks.""SEMI-HOSTILE"" OFFER Sweden has in the past been reluctant to agree to European Union rules that would require public interest tests for business deals but Borg said Pfizer's ""semi-hostile bid"" might force a rethink.""Essentially, we want to retain an open regime, but at the same time, if you behave in the way that Pfizer is doing, then you undermine the legitimacy of that open regime,"" he told reporters. Borg, Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt and opposition leader Stefan Lofven have previously expressed fears the $106 billion approach would lead to job losses in Sweden.Borg, Loof and Bjorklund said in a signed opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal that the guarantees offered by Pfizer over retaining research and jobs in Europe were not sufficient.""If there is no further clarity regarding the effects of Pfizer's possible semi-hostile takeover of AstraZeneca, our conclusion ... is that AstraZeneca's owners should seriously consider rejecting Pfizer's proposal,"" the ministers said.""Pfizer's potential takeover could be interpreted as a sign of short-term capitalism, which we believe is not in the interest of important life-science research in Sweden, in the UK or elsewhere.""The ministers said that since 1999, Pfizer had acquired companies which together employed about 124,000 people. However, the net increase in its workforce since then was only around 25,000, meaning that nearly 100,000 employees had lost their jobs.The U.S. company, which faced similar charges of ruthless cuts from British lawmakers this week, argued that such overall figures did not take account of businesses that had since been spun off.

They also pointed to the experience of Pfizer buying Pharmacia, which led to big research cutbacks.""SEMI-HOSTILE"" OFFER  Sweden has in the past been reluctant to agree to European Union rules that would require public interest tests for business deals but Borg said Pfizer's ""semi-hostile bid"" might force a rethink.""Essentially, we want to retain an open regime, but at the same time, if you behave in the way that Pfizer is doing, then you undermine the legitimacy of that open regime,"" he told reporters.Borg, Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt and opposition leader Stefan Lofven have previously expressed fears the $106 billion approach would lead to job losses in Sweden.Borg, Loof and Bjorklund said in a signed opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal that the guarantees offered by Pfizer over retaining research and jobs in Europe were not sufficient.""If there is no further clarity regarding the effects of Pfizer's possible semi-hostile takeover of AstraZeneca, our conclusion ... is that AstraZeneca's owners should seriously consider rejecting Pfizer's proposal,"" the ministers said.""Pfizer's potential takeover could be interpreted as a sign of short-term capitalism, which we believe is not in the interest of important life-science research in Sweden, in the UK or elsewhere.""The ministers said that since 1999, Pfizer had acquired companies which together employed about 124,000 people. However, the net increase in its workforce since then was only around 25,000, meaning that nearly 100,000 employees had lost their jobs.The U.S. company, which faced similar charges of ruthless cuts from British lawmakers this week, argued that such overall figures did not take account of businesses that had since been spun off. Pfizer also said AstraZeneca itself had reduced its British workforce by around 40 percent in the last few years.

219,"  TOKYO May 16 Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd , Japan's biggest drug company, has no interest in acquisitions driven by tax benefits or synergies, its chief financial officer said, dismissing the forces behind Pfizer Inc's $106 billion offer for AstraZeneca PLC.Takeda CFO Francois-Xavier Roger also rejected the idea that greater size would necessarily be an advantage for his company, the world's 12th largest pharmaceutical company.""We don't believe that being huge is necessarily good. You lose flexibility and agility. Agility is something we value because it allows you to move fast,"" Roger told Reuters in an interview on Friday.Pfizer's pursuit of Britain's AstraZeneca, which has so far been rejected, is driven in large part by the prospects of a lower-tax domicile in the UK, and has spurred expectations of similar offers.Tax savings could be a particularly compelling motive for Japanese companies, which pay among the highest corporate tax rates in the industrialised world and have lobbied hard for reductions. But Roger said tax and cost savings were not currently important considerations that could lure his company into an acquisition deal.""To make a move just for cost-cutting and for tax is not an exciting proposal. You won't see Takeda doing that,"" he said. ""If we go back to acquisitions we would focus again on strategic acquisitions and what they bring to us. Millennium brought us access to oncology, so I have access to a new franchise and a better footprint in the U.S.""He did not dismiss tax and synergy benefits entirely from any M&A discussion, but added: ""It shouldn't be the main driver."" Roger also played down the issue of size when asked about the behemoth that the industry would confront if the union between Pfizer and AstraZeneca were to go through.""We don't feel any pressure,"" he said.""For example, we don't have any objective whatsoever of being in the top 10 in the pharmaceutical industry. Today we are ranking about number 12. If this deal happens we will be number 11, and maybe one day we will be number 10. It doesn't really matter to us.""Citing the example of Abbott Laboratories, which spun off its patent-protected drugs last year, he said: ""They went the other way, probably because they became too big. At the end of the day it's about being agile, being able to move fast, and being efficient in what you do.""

220,"  STOCKHOLM May 16 Owners of drugmaker AstraZeneca, which has half its roots in Sweden, should seriously consider rejecting U.S. rival Pfizer's  proposed takeover unless the consequences are mapped out more clearly, three Swedish government ministers said.Finance Minister Anders Borg, Enterprise Minister Annie Loof and Education Minister Jan Bjorklund said in a signed opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal that Sweden had been reluctant to agree to EU rules that would require public interest tests for business deals.""However, the arguments against such regulation get weaker when we consider past experiences of non-cooperative transactions, such as the one Pfizer is currently trying to accomplish, and the implications they hold for medical research,"" the ministers said. Borg, Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt and opposition leader Stefan Lofven have previously expressed fears the $106 billion approach bid would lead to job losses in Sweden.

It has met entrenched opposition from AstraZeneca, as well as many politicians and scientists who fear cuts to jobs and research.The U.S. group said its new offer was final and could not be increased. It said it would not make a hostile offer directly to AstraZeneca shareholders and would only proceed with an offer with the recommendation of the AstraZeneca board.Pfizer also increased the cash element in its offer to 45 percent, with AstraZeneca shareholders set to receive 1.747 shares in the enlarged company for each of their AstraZeneca shares and 24.76 pounds in cash.The new offer represents a 15 percent premium over the current value of a cash-and-share approach made on May 2 - worth 50 pounds a share at the time - which was swiftly rejected by AstraZeneca.Nonetheless, two analysts - Raghuram Selvaraju of Aegis Capital and ISI Group's Mark Schoenebaum - said they believed the sweetened offer would boost Pfizer's earnings quickly, with Schoenebaum predicting an uplift from 2015.Pfizer also revealed it had written to AstraZeneca's chairman on May 16 offering 53.50 pounds a share - 40 percent in cash - but had been told that this still substantially undervalued the company, prompting it to make the latest last-ditch offer. ""We believe our proposal is compelling for AstraZeneca's shareholders and that a Pfizer-AstraZeneca combination is in the best interests of all stakeholders,"" Pfizer Chief Executive Ian Read said in a statement.He expressed frustration at AstraZeneca's refusal to engage in talks and urged the British company's shareholders to pressure its board to start discussions.""Following a conversation with AstraZeneca earlier today, we do not believe that the AstraZeneca board is currently prepared to recommend a deal at a reasonable price,"" Read said. ""We remain ready to engage in a meaningful dialogue but time for constructive engagement is running out.""Two banking sources earlier described 55 pounds a share as the ""magic number"" at which a deal could get done and Selvaraju of Aegis said Pfizer's declaration that its offer was ""final"" would concentrate minds at AstraZeneca.""The main thing that will be likely to get AstraZeneca to engage is that Ian Read, who is a tough guy, has basically said this is our final offer,"" he said.In the absence of further discussions or an extension of the deadline for making a firm offer under British takeover rules, Pfizer's proposal will expire at 5 p.m. London time on May 26. An AstraZeneca spokeswoman said she had no immediate comment on Pfizer's latest proposal, which would see Pfizer shareholders owning 74 percent of the combined company, with AstraZeneca shareholders holding 26 percent.The increased offer had been widely expected. Pfizer said last week it would consider a higher offer as it urged AstraZeneca's board to enter talks.DRUG PIPELINE HOPES The British firm has laid out details of its pipeline of new drugs and argues there is no inevitability about a Pfizer deal, although its management also acknowledges the board would have to consider a compelling bid.Investors have backed AstraZeneca in rejecting 50 pounds a share, but many have said they would want it to engage in discussions if Pfizer came back with an improved offer. They fear AstraZeneca shares will tumble if Pfizer walks away. There has been a mounting political backlash against the proposed deal in Britain, the United States and Sweden, where AstraZeneca has half its roots.The Swedish government launched a concerted effort on Friday against a merger it fears will lead to cuts in science jobs and research, echoing concerns aired by British lawmakers at two parliamentary hearings last week and fears for U.S. jobs in states where AstraZeneca has a large presence.Pfizer's bid would be the largest foreign takeover of a British firm and is opposed by many scientists and politicians who fear it will undermine Britain's science base.British Prime Minister David Cameron has said he wants more assurances from Pfizer, and science minister David Willetts said last week he would like to see longer guarantees on investment than the five years currently promised by Pfizer.The UK government has held exploratory discussions with Brussels about strengthening its ability to force Pfizer to honour commitments on jobs and research under European Union rules.But Cameron, head of the free-market Conservative Party, has also said Britain does not want to be seen to be pulling up the drawbridge to foreign companies.Although Pfizer has given a five-year commitment to complete AstraZeneca's new research centre in Cambridge, retain a factory in northern England and put a fifth of its research staff in Britain, it has said this could be adjusted if circumstances change ""significantly"".Pfizer's Read said on Sunday: ""We stand by our unprecedented commitments to the UK government.""The tax aspects of the deal, meanwhile, have sparked anger in the United States, where lawmakers are now considering legislation to prevent so-called corporate inversions, under which U.S. companies re-incorporate overseas to avoid U.S. taxes.Inversions have helped fuel a wave of deals in the pharmaceuticals sector in recent months, but buying AstraZeneca would allow Pfizer to carry out the largest such deal yet.($1 = 0.5942 British Pounds)   (Additional reporting by Michele Gershberg in New York; Editing by Larry King, Cynthia Osterman and Eric Walsh)",2014-05-18,PFE,"Sun May 18, 2014 | 7:58pm EDT",UPDATE 4-Pfizer raises bid for AstraZeneca to $117 billion,http://www.reuters.com//article/astrazeneca-pfizer-idUSL6N0O413J20140518?type=companyNews

226,"  * Pfizer considering sweetening offer for British drugmaker* May 26 deadline for U.S. to make formal offer or walk away* Significant gap in price ideas between two sides* Pfizer wants agreed deal but hostile bid not ruled outBy Ben Hirschler and Anjuli DaviesLONDON, May 18 Pfizer is considering raising its offer for AstraZeneca as it works with its advisers against the clock in a battle where they have just eight days left to move under British takeover rules.Pfizer still hopes to get AstraZeneca into negotiations before the May 26 deadline for it to make a formal bid or walk away, but has not ruled out a hostile bid in the $100 billion-plus takeover fight, people familiar with the matter said.""Going hostile is the least favourite option but taking the offer direct to shareholders is a possibility,"" said one source. Pfizer made a cash-and-stock takeover approach worth $106 billion or 50 pounds a share on May 2, although its value has since slipped to around 48 pounds, reflecting a fall in Pfizer's shares.The U.S. group wants to create the world's largest drugs company, with a headquarters in New York but a tax base in Britain, and would much prefer a recommended deal allowing it access to AstraZeneca's books.But the gap in pricing the company between the two sides is described as ""meaningful"" and ""significant"" by sources, suggesting Pfizer will have to make a sizeable jump in price to secure engagement with its rival.In rejecting Pfizer's May 2 proposal, AstraZeneca argued that the price undervalued it substantially and the offer also exposed shareholders to significant risks, since 68 percent of the transaction would be in Pfizer shares rather than cash. Chief Executive Pascal Soriot has laid out details of AstraZeneca's promising pipeline of new drugs and argues there is ""no inevitability"" about the Pfizer deal, although he also acknowledges the board would have to consider a compelling bid.55 POUNDS ""MAGIC NUMBER"" Investors have backed AstraZeneca in rejecting 50 pounds a share but many want it to engage if Pfizer comes back with an improved offer, with two banking sources describing 55 pounds as the ""magic number"" at which a deal could get done.

229,"   By Ben Hirschler | LONDON  LONDON Britain's AstraZeneca on Monday rejected a sweetened and ""final"" offer from Pfizer, puncturing the U.S. drugmaker's plan for a merger to create the world's biggest pharmaceuticals group.The rebuff came nine hours after Pfizer said on Sunday night it had raised its takeover offer to 55 pounds a share, or around 70 billion pounds ($118 billion) in total, and would walk away if AstraZeneca did not accept it.The rejection left some major shareholders fuming as shares in AstraZeneca slumped 11 percent to close at 42.88 pounds after falling as much as 15 percent - their biggest ever intra-day decline. Pfizer rose 1 percent in New York.AstraZeneca Chairman Leif Johansson told Reuters he now saw no prospect of a deal with Pfizer before a deadline of May 26 set under British takeover rules, or any likelihood of that deadline being extended.Experts also said Pfizer had left itself no room to return with a last-minute higher offer due to the strict takeover code.Pfizer wants to create the world's largest drugs firm, with a headquarters in New York but a tax base in Britain, where corporate tax rates are lower than in the United States. The plan has met entrenched opposition from AstraZeneca, as well as politicians and scientists who fear cuts to jobs and research.""It died of multiple wounds. Too little cash, too many suspicions about Pfizer's motives, and too little confidence in its assurances about jobs,"" said Erik Gordon, professor at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business.

He blamed Pfizer for calling a halt to discussions after a telephone call lasting more than an hour with Pfizer's chairman and CEO Ian Read on Sunday afternoon.In addition to the inadequate price, Johansson also slammed what he said was a lack of industrial logic behind Pfizer's move; the risks posed to shareholders by the controversial tax plans; and the threat to life science jobs in Britain, Sweden and the United States.""Pfizer's approach throughout its pursuit of AstraZeneca appears to have been fundamentally driven by the corporate financial benefits to its shareholders of cost savings and tax minimization,"" Johansson said in a statement. ""From our first meeting in January to our latest discussion yesterday, and in the numerous phone calls in between, Pfizer has failed to make a compelling strategic, business or value case.""But many of Johansson's shareholders were deeply unimpressed. ""We do not think the Astra management have done a good job on behalf of shareholders,"" said one fund manager at a top-10 investor in the group.Alastair Gunn of top-30 shareholder Jupiter Fund Management said: ""We are disappointed the board of AstraZeneca has rejected Pfizer's latest offer so categorically. They should have at least engaged in a constructive conversation with Pfizer.""However, Pfizer's proposed takeover, which would be the largest-ever foreign acquisition of a British company, is opposed by many scientists and politicians who fear it would undermine Britain's science base.The U.S. group said its new offer was final and could not be increased. It said it would not make a hostile offer directly to AstraZeneca shareholders and would only proceed with an offer with the recommendation of the AstraZeneca board.Pfizer had also increased the cash element in its offer to 45 percent, under which AstraZeneca shareholders would get 1.747 shares in the enlarged company for each of their AstraZeneca shares and 24.76 pounds in cash. The new offer represents a 15-percent premium over the current value of a cash-and-share approach made on May 2 - worth 50 pounds a share at the time - which was also swiftly rejected by AstraZeneca.Pfizer's Read said he believed his proposal was ""compelling"" for AstraZeneca shareholders and expressed frustration at its refusal to talk, urging the British company's shareholders to pressure its board to engage.TAKE A BREAK In the absence of further discussions or an extension of the deadline for making a firm offer under British takeover rules, Pfizer's proposal will expire at 5 p.m. (1600 GMT) on May 26. After that, it would have to wait six months before making another bid.""AstraZeneca will have six months to demonstrate that it was right to reject Pfizer's offer, or face the prospect of a fresh approach,"" said analyst Mick Cooper at Edison Investment Research. While Pfizer would have to wait on the sidelines until November, it would be possible for AstraZeneca to initiate talks from late August, if it decided it wants coax a higher offer.The latest increased offer had been widely expected. Pfizer said last week it would consider a higher offer as it urged AstraZeneca's board to enter talks.The British firm has laid out details of its pipeline of new drugs and argues it has no need for a deal. However, many analysts believe its projections that it can increase sales by 75 percent to $45 billion a year by 2023 are over-optimistic.There has been a mounting political backlash against the proposed deal in Britain, the United States and Sweden, where AstraZeneca has half its roots.The Swedish government launched a concerted effort on Friday against a merger that it fears will lead to cuts in science jobs and research, echoing concerns aired by British lawmakers at two parliamentary hearings last week, and fears for U.S. jobs in states where AstraZeneca has a large presence.British Prime Minister David Cameron has said he wanted more assurances from Pfizer, in the event of a takeover, although as the head of the free-market Conservative Party he does not want to be seen to be deterring foreign corporate investment.Pfizer gave a five-year commitment to complete AstraZeneca's new research centre in Cambridge, retain a factory in northern England and put a fifth of its research staff in Britain, but added that these pledges could be adjusted if circumstances changed ""significantly"".The tax aspects of the deal, meanwhile, have sparked anger in the United States, where lawmakers are now considering legislation to prevent what are known as corporate inversions, under which U.S. companies re-incorporate overseas to avoid U.S. taxes.Inversions have helped fuel a wave of deals in the pharmaceuticals sector in recent months.

230,"   By Bill Berkrot | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Pfizer Inc may have called its $118 billion bid for AstraZeneca Plc a ""final"" offer, and its British rival sees no prospect of a deal being revived. But Wall Street isn't ready to call in the undertakers.""The deal is wounded, but perhaps not dead,"" said Mark Schoenebaum, an analyst with ISI Group in New York.Morningstar analyst Damien Conover in Chicago said the odds of an AstraZeneca purchase had fallen well below the 50 percent mark.AstraZeneca shareholders, some of them already expressing their disappointment over the company's rebuff of Pfizer, may still pressure the board to reconsider, analysts and fund managers said on Monday. That could force the British company to engage with Pfizer, the largest U.S. drugmaker.If they don't, Pfizer could come back with a new price in six months' time as prescribed by UK takeover rules.""I still have to believe this deal is far from dead,"" said Raghuram Selvaraju, healthcare equity research analyst with Aegis Capital in New York, noting that substantial stakeholders on both sides want the deal to happen.""If Pfizer can tweak its bid a little bit more, then AstraZeneca shareholders are getting a very good deal, and they should take it,"" Selvaraju said. ""They're really not that far apart as far as I can tell."" When Pfizer delivered its ""final"" cash-and-stock offer of 55 pounds per share - or around 70 billion pounds - on Sunday, it said it would walk away rather than go directly to shareholders in a hostile takeover maneuver. AstraZeneca management had indicated any offer below 58.85 pounds per share undervalued the company.""It seems like Pfizer was very adamant about wanting to do the deal. The latest salvo of discussion suggests the chances have declined, but they're not zero,"" said Les Funtleyder, author of ""Healthcare Investing"" and a consulting partner in U.K.-based Bluecloud Healthcare consulting firm.Pfizer spokeswoman Joan Campion said in an emailed statement: ""The fate of the deal is now up to AstraZeneca's shareholders. We believe our final proposal represents compelling and full value for AstraZeneca shareholders.""If the deal goes through, it would create the world's largest drugmaker. FEW OTHER TARGETS One of the primary reasons driving Pfizer's bid for AstraZeneca is the UK's significantly lower corporate tax rate, which Pfizer could take advantage of if it were allowed to redomicile in Britain. Those kinds of savings would not be available if it chose another takeover target.Len Yaffe, portfolio manager of the San Francisco-based healthcare fund StockDoc Partners, which has Pfizer holdings, said he believes Pfizer should focus on building its pipeline of drugs in development rather than tax engineering.""Where they would get a better return in the long term, it would make sense for them to buy,"" Yaffe said, citing large biotech companies such as Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Gilead Sciences Celgene and Biogen Idec, whose promising new drugs have lifted their stock prices. Pfizer Chief Executive Officer Ian Read has signaled the company won't consider large U.S. drugmaker acquisitions, given the comparatively high tax rates.AstraZeneca has been promoting its own pipeline, especially its cancer immunotherapy drugs, in making the case that Pfizer has undervalued the company. CEO Pascal Soriot forecast revenue growing above $45 billion by 2023.""Pascal Soriot can say whatever he wants about projections that go out 10 years. The only thing we know about such projections is that they will be wrong,"" Selvaraju said.For tax-inversion purposes, GlaxoSmithKline with a market cap of $132 billion was the only comparable target, according to Selvaraju.""GlaxoSmithKline is nowhere near as weak as AstraZeneca,"" he said. ""It almost has to be (AstraZeneca) or Pfizer goes back to playing the waiting game.""(Reporting by Bill Berkrot; Editing by Michele Gershberg and Jan Paschal)",2014-05-19,PFE,"Mon May 19, 2014 | 6:37pm EDT",Pfizer-AstraZeneca deal not quite dead yet,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-astrazeneca-pfizer-comeback-idUSBREA4I0UM20140519?type=companyNews
231,"  * Rebuff to new offer angers AstraZeneca shareholders* Pfizer offers 55 pounds a share in ""final"" proposal* Says won't go hostile, only proceed with agreed deal* AstraZeneca shares fall 11 pct as hopes of deal dive   (Adds Breakingviews link)By Ben HirschlerLONDON, May 19 Britain's AstraZeneca on Monday rejected a sweetened and ""final"" offer from Pfizer , puncturing the U.S. drugmaker's plan for a merger to create the world's biggest pharmaceuticals group.The rebuff came nine hours after Pfizer said on Sunday night it had raised its takeover offer to 55 pounds a share, or around 70 billion pounds ($118 billion) in total, and would walk away if AstraZeneca did not accept it.The rejection left some major shareholders fuming as shares in AstraZeneca slumped 11 percent to close at 42.88 pounds after falling as much as 15 percent - their biggest ever intra-day decline. Pfizer rose 1 percent in New York.AstraZeneca Chairman Leif Johansson told Reuters he now saw no prospect of a deal with Pfizer before a deadline of May 26 set under British takeover rules, or any likelihood of that deadline being extended.Experts also said Pfizer had left itself no room to return with a last-minute higher offer due to the strict takeover code.Pfizer wants to create the world's largest drugs firm, with a headquarters in New York but a tax base in Britain, where corporate tax rates are lower than in the United States. The plan has met entrenched opposition from AstraZeneca, as well as politicians and scientists who fear cuts to jobs and research.""It died of multiple wounds. Too little cash, too many suspicions about Pfizer's motives, and too little confidence in its assurances about jobs,"" said Erik Gordon, professor at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business.

Analysts had expected interest rates to rise, but with rates touching seven-month lows, the bond rally has helped U.S. stocks from falling further and kept at bay a long-expected correction.""The big story is the bond market, that is the one thing that stands out like a sore thumb,"" said Stephen Massocca, managing director at Wedbush Equity Management LLC in San Francisco.""If we did not get this big decrease in rates, the (stock) market would've corrected,"" Massocca said.

The British drugmaker rejected a sweetened and final merger offer from Pfizer that would have created the world's largest pharmaceuticals group. Pfizer shares climbed 1.1 percent to $29.45. AT&T slid 1.9 percent to $36.03 and dragged on the Dow a day after the telecom company said it will acquire DirecTV  for $48.5 billion, as it seeks fresh avenues of growth beyond the maturing U.S. cellular business.  DirecTV shares fell 1.4 percent to $84.92.Equities have come under pressure recently with the S&P 500 marking consecutive weekly declines for the first time since January as investors have become concerned about the U.S. economy's growth prospects. Last week, readings on retail sales and consumer sentiment fell shy of expectations while labor and housing data provided reason for optimism. But with the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note  at 2.5 percent, investors may have been compelled to wade into equities and help keep them afloat.""Part of this - driven by where rates are at and bonds continuing to rally - when you might look for a pullback in the stock market, that is making stocks look more attractive,"" said Stephen Massocca, managing director at Wedbush Equity Management LLC in San Francisco.""It is maybe preventing a decline of which we are a little overdue in the stock market, from a valuation perspective."" The Dow Jones industrial average fell 1.93 points or 0.01 percent, to 16,489.38. The S&P 500 gained 4.83 points or 0.26 percent, to 1,882.69. The Nasdaq Composite  added 29.79 points or 0.73 percent, to 4,120.38.Small-cap stocks, often the first beneficiaries of growth, managed to rebound. The small-cap Russell 2000 index was up 0.7 percent after three straight declines. The index has several times approached correction territory, a decline of 10 percent from a recent high, only to bounce back slightly.Investors' defensive posture has been reflected by a sector rotation into utilities, telecoms and energy, which have outperformed the broader S&P 500 over the past three months.Campbell Soup Co fell 2.9 percent to $43.81 and ranked as the S&P 500's worst performer.

237,"  * FTSEurofirst 300 closes down 0.2 pct at 1,358.91 points* AstraZeneca slumps after rejecting ""final"" Pfizer bid* Deutsche Bank capital increase hits bank stocksBy Sudip Kar-GuptaLONDON, May 19 European equities were pulled down on Monday by the pharmaceuticals group AstraZeneca, which slumped after rejecting a bid from Pfizer, and by Deutsche Bank's announcement of a capital increase.The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index, which last week hit a 6-year high of 1,372.81 points, closed down 0.2 percent at 1,358.91 points. The euro zone's blue-chip Euro STOXX 50 index also fell 0.1 percent to 3,169.90 points.AstraZeneca's shares dropped 11.1 percent to take the most points off the FTSEurofirst 300, after the British company rejected a sweetened ""final"" cash-and-stock offer from Pfizer, casting doubt on the U.S. drugmaker's plan to create the world's biggest pharmaceuticals group.""Despite Pfizer having spent a large amount of money and time, the signal seems clear from AstraZeneca's board of directors, UK politicians and mainstream media that this is a bad deal, and we see limited efforts from Pfizer going forward,"" said Peter Garnry, head of equity strategy at Saxo Bank. ""Its shareholders will not appreciate a fourth attempt as it will inflate the valuation too much, relative to deal risk,"" he added.BANK SHARES WEAKEN  Deutsche Bank's shares fell 1.7 percent after it announced an 8 billion euro ($11 billion) capital increase.The fall pushed the STOXX Europe 600 Bank Index down by 0.8 percent, with some analysts and investors expecting that other banks may also have to raise capital to strengthen their balance sheets.""The banks are under all sorts of pressure at the moment. I think that quite a few investors got into the banks' rally quite late and have been caught out at the top,"" said Rupert Baker, equity sales executive at Mirabaud Securities.In spite of Monday's pullback, some investors were still upbeat on the prospects for European equities, with both the FTSEurofirst 300 index and the STOXX Europe 600 Bank Index up by nearly 20 percent since the start of 2013. Richard Marwood, senior investment manager at AXA Investment Management, said prospects that the European Central Bank (ECB) could cut interest rates next month were providing a relative safety net for equities, since any such move by the ECB would hit returns on bonds and enhance the appeal of equities.Nick Davis, European equities fund manager at Threadneedle Investments, also said European shares looked a good bet in the long run, with the FTSEurofirst 300 index up by 3 percent since the start of 2014.""Europe is moving in the right direction. This process has been and will likely continue to be volatile, given the necessary adjustments, but we expect the market will ultimately reward those patient enough to look through the volatility,"" he said.($1 = 0.7289 Euros)(additional reporting by Francesco Canepa; Editing by Kevin Liffey)",2014-05-19,PFE,"Mon May 19, 2014 | 12:52pm EDT",AstraZeneca and Deutsche Bank drag down European shares,http://www.reuters.com//article/markets-europe-stocks-idUSL6N0O53TJ20140519?type=companyNews
238,"  * FTSE 100 down 0.2 percent* AstraZeneca dives after rejecting Pfizer offer* Airlines buoyed by Ryanair resultsBy Tricia Wright and Alistair SmoutLONDON, May 19 Britain's top shares fell on Monday, dented by a sharp drop in pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca after it rejected rival Pfizer's higher takeover bid.AstraZeneca dived 11.1 percent after turning down Pfizer's 55 pounds/share take-it-or-leave-it offer.That steep decline was the biggest drag on the FTSE 100  by some margin, with the index closing down 11.26 points, or 0.2 percent, at 6,844.55 points. AstraZeneca had risen more than 27 percent in the month since the first Pfizer bid was reported, and traders said that a deal was now unlikely after Pfizer appeared reluctant to engage in a hostile approach.""With Pfizer saying they won't go hostile, it looks like it is pretty much dead,"" Will Hedden, sales trader at IG, said.""The rhetoric from certain government sections about securing jobs in the UK will have been a hurdle and certainly put off AstraZeneca shareholders."" Recent price moves had left AstraZeneca trading at a forward price/EPS multiple of 19.5, according to StarMine data, compared to 15.5 for GlaxoSmithKline and 14.3 for Sanofi , and over double its 10-year median of 9.3.But following Monday's share price pull-back, Citi took the opportunity to add AstraZeneca to its Focus List Europe.It reckoned the market still under-appreciated AstraZeneca's portfolio in both immune-oncology and the management of auto-immune related disease. The FTSE 100 retraced some of the previous week's 0.6 percent gain, which saw it touch 14-year highs. On Thursday it came within 0.8 percent of all-time highs set in December 1999.""With the FTSE 100 close to all-time-high territory, concerns have once again been raised in relation to valuation, which is creating something of a headwind,"" said Jeremy Batstone-Carr, analyst at Charles Stanley.In common with AstraZeneca, the broader market is also trading above long-run average valuations. The FTSE 100 trades at a price to earnings ratio of 13.8, compared to a 10-year average of 11.8, Thomson Reuters Datastream showed.The top two risers were airlines easyJet, up 4.7 percent, and International Consolidated Airlines, up 3.5 percent, as forecast-beating results from Irish peer Ryanair  buoyed the sector.Both easyJet and International Consolidated Airlines succumbed to profit taking in recent sessions - down 10 percent and 6.9 percent respectively last week - as investors cashed in profits on powerful rallies seen over the past 12 months.

""Given the increase in the offer we would encourage the AstraZeneca management to recommence their engagement with Pfizer, and subsequently their shareholders,"" the fund manager, which owns 2 percent of AstraZeneca, said.Schroders' comments echoed those of other shareholders, including Jupiter Asset Management Ltd, which were dismayed at AstraZeneca's rejection of Pfizer's offer on Monday.Astra said that under UK takeover rules, there could be no further talks with Pfizer and that the U.S. drugmaker could not privately or publicly even suggest it was willing to raise its ""final"" rejected bid prior to a May 26 deadline unless a third party made a higher offer. ""This restriction that prevents further negotiation on value is a consequence of Pfizer's actions,"" AstraZeneca Chairman Leif Johansson said in a statement.Pfizer declined to comment on the AstraZeneca statement. The largest U.S. drugmaker had previously said it was now up to Astra shareholders to urge the board to reconsider Pfizer's final offer.The deal would have created the world's biggest drugs group. Instead, AstraZeneca's rejection triggered the biggest intra-day slump in its shares since the creation of the company through a merger of British and Swedish businesses in 1999.The anger, however, was not universal. ""I think Astra did the right thing. I don't think that Pfizer was a suitable partner,"" said Dominic Rossi, London-based Fidelity's global chief investment officer for equities, arguing the deal was motivated by Pfizer's desire to cut taxes.""The Astra board has taken a very difficult decision. They understood in rejecting the offer they would be criticised by some shareholders. We will now have to wait two to three years to see whether they were right. With a little luck they could well be."" Fidelity owns 1.2 percent of AstraZeneca, according to Thomson Reuters data.Anne Richards, chief investment officer at Aberdeen Asset Management which holds 2.4 percent of the British drugmaker, also said Pfizer's offer ""certainly wasn't a knock-out.""Veteran fund manager Neil Woodford, who controls AstraZeneca shares in funds he runs for wealth manager St James's Place , said he was ""relieved that AstraZeneca appears to have retained its independence.""Strict British takeover rules mean the angry stalemate between AstraZeneca and Pfizer is almost certain to end with no deal, unless AstraZeneca's board did a U-turn and recommended Pfizer's final offer.AstraZeneca shares ended 0.5 percent higher in London, while their shares on the New York Stock Exchange rose 1.7 percent shortly before the close of trading.

254,"   By Chris Vellacott | LONDON  LONDON Some leading AstraZeneca Plc shareholders were at odds over whether the British drugmaker made the right decision in rejecting Pfizer Inc's final $118 billion bid to buy the company.Schroder Investment Management Ltd (SDR.L), AstraZeneca's (AZN.L) 12th-biggest shareholder, urged the drugmaker on Tuesday to restart takeover talks with Pfizer (PFE.N) while Fidelity Worldwide Investment (UK) Ltd, holder of the 18th largest stake in Astra, backed the British company's stance.The division highlighted a split among investors following the collapse of a potential transaction, leaving many shareholders frustrated at missing out on a big windfall.Schroders said it was disappointed with ""the quick rejection by the AstraZeneca board"" of an improved 55 pounds-a-share offer and the decision by Pfizer to ""draw a premature end to these negotiations by calling their latest proposal final.""""Given the increase in the offer we would encourage the AstraZeneca management to recommence their engagement with Pfizer, and subsequently their shareholders,"" the fund manager, which owns 2 percent of AstraZeneca, said.Schroders' comments echoed those of other shareholders, including Jupiter Asset Management Ltd (JUP.L), which were dismayed at AstraZeneca's rejection of Pfizer's offer on Monday. Astra said that under UK takeover rules, there could be no further talks with Pfizer and that the U.S. drugmaker could not privately or publicly even suggest it was willing to raise its ""final"" rejected bid prior to a May 26 deadline unless a third party made a higher offer.""This restriction that prevents further negotiation on value is a consequence of Pfizer's actions,"" AstraZeneca Chairman Leif Johansson said in a statement.Pfizer declined to comment on the AstraZeneca statement.

257,"   By Guy Faulconbridge and Alissa de Carbonnel | LONDON/MOSCOW  LONDON/MOSCOW Prince Charles's comparison of Russian President Vladimir Putin with Adolf Hitler triggered a diplomatic row on Thursday when Moscow scolded the heir to the British throne for what it said was an outrageous attempt to sully Russia's reputation over Ukraine.During a trip to Canada, the 65-year-old prince told a Jewish woman who fled from Poland during World War Two that in Ukraine ""Putin is doing just about the same as Hitler"", according to the Daily Mail newspaper.Charles's remarks, described by a royal source as ""well-intentioned"" and not meant to be made public, caused a stir in Britain because the royal family is not expected to voice political views in public.""If these words were truly spoken, then, without doubt, they do not reflect well on the future British monarch,"" a spokesman for the Russian Foreign Ministry told a news conference.""We view the use of the Western press by members of the British royal family to spread the propaganda campaign against Russia on a pressing issue - that is, the situation in Ukraine - as unacceptable, outrageous and low.""Russian diplomats were seeking an official explanation over the remarks, which are especially emotive for a country that lost more people than any other in World War Two.But the British Foreign Office said it had told a senior Russian official in London on Thursday that it would not comment on reports of private conversations. Putin, a former KGB spy who has repeatedly spoken about the sacrifices of what Russians call the Great Patriotic War, lost a brother in the Nazi siege of Leningrad.The Soviet Union lost more than 20 million people in the war and the victory over Nazi Germany is celebrated across Russia as a national triumph.But Putin's annexation of Ukraine's Crimea province has prompted some Ukrainian protesters and even some Western politicians to make comparisons between the 61-year-old Russian president and the actions of Hitler.Former U.S. secretary of state Hillary Clinton had to clarify remarks in March suggesting Putin's justification for his incursion into Crimea to protect ethnic Russians was reminiscent of claims made by Hitler over foreign territories. HEIR TO THE THRONE It was not the first time that the man destined to be king has taken British politicians and royal watchers by surprise. In a private diary that was leaked, he once described the Chinese Communist leadership as ""appalling old waxworks"".Queen Elizabeth, Charles's 88-year-old mother, has never aired any such emotive sentiments in public, though her husband, Prince Philip, is famous for a host of unusually blunt comments and off-the-cuff remarks.""This was a private conversation and we are not exactly sure what was said. It certainly wasn't meant to be a diplomatic intervention,"" said Clarissa Campbell Orr, historian of the monarchy at Anglia Ruskin University in Cambridge. ""But this is a very sensitive issue for Russia. We know the Russians are offended but the prince was not making an official statement.

258,"  * FTSE slips 0.1 pct, posts biggest weekly loss since April* Tullow, Burberry among top fallers* AstraZeneca stages late bounce on Pfizer deal speculation* UK stock market shut on MondayBy Francesco CanepaLONDON, May 23 Britain's top equity index slipped on Friday to record its biggest weekly loss in more than a month, led by selloffs in oil group Tullow and luxury brand Burberry.AstraZeneca bucked the downtrend as traders placed speculative bets on a deal with U.S. suitor Pfizer Inc  ahead of Monday's offer deadline.Shares in Tullow fell 1.2 percent as the oil explorer said one of its wells in Ethiopia hit water. The stock has lost more than a third of its value since 2013 following a string of disappointing exploration updates. ""It's another disappointing result in East Africa for Tullow and the market, in our view, already prices in success above the existing discoveries in this region,"" Brian Gallagher, an analyst at Investec, said.""This mean that Tullow needs to start finding the mark soon or the upside assumption could soon be challenged.""The FTSE 100 closed 0.1 percent lower at 6,815.75 points, recording a 0.6 percent fall on the week, the steepest since April 10.Luxury group Burberry, down 1.7 percent, was among top FTSE fallers as a price target cut and gloomy comments by Exane reignited concerns about the brand, which is heavily exposed to volatile emerging market currencies. Shares in AstraZeneca, however, rose 1.2 percent after staging a late bounce. Under British takeover rules, Pfizer's latest takeover offer expires on May 26, after which the U.S. group would have to wait six months before making another bid.""The market is pricing in a cheap call for something to happen over the weekend,"" a trader in London said. EU ELECTIONS Appetite for European shares has been sapped by uncertainty over the outcome of EU parliamentary elections, in which strong performances by Eurosceptic parties could undermine governments' efforts to move towards greater integration.Shares in Italy and Greece are likely to come under pressure if Eurosceptic parties gain ground in the European polls.""The effect on the UK markets is to exacerbate the traditional risk-off into a long weekend, especially when the United States is also off,"" Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, said.The market shrugged off early indications that Britain's anti-EU UKIP party had made widely anticipated gains in local elections.""UKIP may win the European parliament elections by tapping into anti-EU, anti-immigration sentiment,"" analysts at Berenberg wrote in a note.""But that is a protest vote. European election voter turnout is low, the parliament is of limited relevance, and governments often get a kicking in mid-term elections.""

261,"  (Adds futures prices, company news)     LONDON, May 23 European shares are expected to open steady on Friday, with investors seen avoiding strong bets ahead of Ukrainian and European election results.     At 0625 GMT, futures for the Euro STOXX 50, Britain's FTSE 100 , Germany's DAX and France's CAC were flat to 0.09 percent lower.     Investors will keep a close eye on Ukraine, where more than a dozen servicemen were reported killed on Thursday in a clash with pro-Russian separatists, fuelling security concerns ahead of Sunday's presidential election, seen as crucial for its fragile democracy.      ""Fears are that a presidential election will merely polarise the two sides and could be a trigger for an escalation of fighting,"" Jonathan Sudaria, dealer at Capital Spreads, said.     ""With the (European Union) voting already under way, concerns are brewing that the corridors of power in Brussels could be full of eurosceptic, anti-establishment parliamentarians.""     The EU's marathon parliamentary election kicked off on Thursday when Britain and the Netherlands voted, with right-wing, anti-EU parties expected to attract a surge of protest votes in many countries on a low turnout.      Analysts said there were concerns the EU elections could destabilise some euro zone governments at home. In Italy, for example, a poor result for Prime Minister Matteo Renzi's party could weaken his drive for swift reforms that he promised when he took power.     Italian and Spanish stocks underperformed firmer equity markets elsewhere in Europe on Thursday on caution ahead of the EU election results. Italy's FTSE MIB  closed down 1.1 percent, while Spain's IBEX fell 0.1 percent.     The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index, edged up 0.1 percent to 1,366.29 points - in sight of a six-year high of 1,372.81 points set last week.

264,"   By Ben Hirschler | LONDON  LONDON On a sunny day in San Francisco last January, AstraZeneca Chief Executive Pascal Soriot was on his way to the Westin St. Francis hotel on Union Square to give investors some unexpectedly good news.After long refusing to put a date on when the British drugmaker's sales figures would pull out of a nosedive, Soriot surprised the market on January 14 with a bold prediction that sales by 2017 would be back at 2013 levels.What shareholders did not know at the time was that two days earlier AstraZeneca had written to U.S. rival Pfizer rejecting its offer to buy the London-based group for close to $100 billion.Shares rose on the 2017 sales forecast as investors looked forward to a time when AstraZeneca would finally put behind it a wave of patent expiries on its drugs. It was a defiant performance by Soriot - CEO for little over a year - whose long-term forecast suggested much of Wall Street had got his firm's valuation all wrong.""Essentially we believe that we can return to growth faster than most people have been forecasting so far,"" he told the annual JP Morgan Healthcare Conference. ""Our next step would be that, by 2020, we want to launch at least 10 new medicines.""The previous week in New York, Frenchman Soriot and Swedish Chairman Leif Johansson had met with Scottish-born Pfizer boss Ian Read and his New Jersey finance head Frank D'Amelio to discuss details of a possible deal in the neutral ground of the Pierre hotel overlooking a snowy Central Park.Those talks in turn had been prefaced by an email and phone call from Read to Johansson proposing a merger on November 25.So both sides had plenty of time to develop a war-game for what was always going to be a politically charged takeover fight, involving the biggest attempted foreign takeover of a British firm and the creation of the world's largest pharmaceuticals group - with a conveniently reduced tax bill.Yet despite a horde of advisers, Pfizer walked away on May 26 empty-handed, exactly four weeks after going public with its bid interest.The fight was actually lost a week earlier after an angry stand-off on Sunday May 18 in which both sides blamed each other for closing down talks on a $118 billion offer that was ""only"" about $8 billion adrift from the price AstraZeneca wanted.UNFINISHED BUSINESS This may not be the end, of course. Under UK takeover rules Pfizer is allowed to make a new approach in November, while AstraZeneca could invite Pfizer back into fresh talks on a new offer at the end of August, if the chorus from its shareholders demanding talks is loud enough. It is a prospect some in the Pfizer camp are keen to talk up. ""Most shareholders seem to think that this transaction is a good value-creating idea and that we are very close on price,"" said one person close to the U.S. firm. ""I'm still hopeful that by the end of the year we will see this combination happening.""A person familiar with the matter in the AstraZeneca camp also admitted: ""It's still alive. There's still a lot of premium (in the share price).""Whether Pfizer pounces again and AstraZeneca can escape once more depends on Soriot's ability to prove his firm's research labs have what it takes to deliver on his bold promises of growth by 2017 and a 75 percent increase in drug sales by 2023.The first step in doing that involves Soriot climbing on yet another plane to America at the end of the week, this time to Chicago, where his team will showcase the latest clinical data on its cancer drugs at the May 30 to June 3 annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO).AstraZeneca has already reported some good clinical trial results for one new lung cancer drug, known as AZD9291, which will be presented to doctors in full at ASCO. [ID:nL1N0O1084]That leaves the biggest question-mark over MEDI4736, a drug designed to fight tumors by tapping the immune system, which is being tested in combination with other medicines and which AstraZeneca reckons could become a $6.5 billion-a-year seller. The quality of the clinical data on MEDI4736 will give investors important clues, but they will also be watching just as closely how similar drugs perform at ASCO from rivals like Roche, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Merck & Co.At the same time, AstraZeneca will look at its own deal-making options, including potential partnership agreements in cancer and other areas. It has already said it is exploring such options in infection and neuroscience.Whatever the news from ASCO and on deals, however, many AstraZeneca investors remain deeply frustrated - and puzzled - at the way the biggest deal in the history of the pharmaceutical industry slipped away this month, depriving them of a windfall.The reasons for that lie in the fraught weekend of May 17-18, when, after two days of grilling for both CEOs in front of two committees of British lawmakers, Pfizer came back with a sweetened offer of 53.50 pounds a share on the Friday night.BRINKMANSHIP Read and his advisers were convinced they had tapped into what AstraZeneca's shareholders were thinking - indeed, Read met again with investors after the hearings - and they were sure they had an offer that would bring their target to the table. That proved to be a miscalculation.The new price certainly got AstraZeneca's attention at a lengthy meeting of its board on May 17 at the London offices of law firm Freshfields, and led to a phone call lasting more than an hour between the two sides on May 18, when AstraZeneca made clear it needed at least 58.85 pounds.Read's last-ditch act of brinkmanship - issuing a final offer of 55 pounds a share, without warning - failed to break the AstraZeneca board's resolve and also failed to trigger a decisive investor rebellion.It was not the script most investors had expected, not least because Pfizer had always got its prey in the past, and the initial maneuvers following its 50 pounds-a-share offer on May 2 also seemed to play out well for the U.S. firm.Pfizer's letter to British Prime Minister David Cameron offering reassurances on jobs and research initially won a warm reception from the government. The political atmosphere then turned hostile for Pfizer, however, and AstraZeneca's fightback - playing up its revitalized pipeline of cancer drugs - brought some solid support from a few vocal investors.What happens next will depend on how much pressure Soriot and his team face from shareholders, some of whom are already demanding that management pay packages be linked to the company's shares reaching the 55 pounds share price that Pfizer had offered or the 58.85 that AstraZeneca reckons it is worth.Investor ambivalence is highlighted by BlackRock, the biggest shareholder, which backed the board's dismissal of Pfizer on price, but also wants more talks down the road.AstraZeneca always said it was ready to talk if Pfizer offered the right price, but it also insisted that key execution risks had to be addressed or eliminated, principally Pfizer's controversial plan to make Britain its tax base, without which the financial logic of the deal would collapse.Things reached a nadir in the eyes of many of those involved when Soriot told lawmakers that a merger could cost lives by delaying vital new cancer drugs, a statement one person on Pfizer's side described as ""poisoning the well"".So could things have turned out differently? Yes, according to one source in the AstraZeneca camp, who said Pfizer should simply have moved faster. Read was right to spot the promise of AstraZeneca's cancer pipeline but too slow to act.The real tactical error, he said, was not to have gone with a bid in November or pushed harder in January, before AstraZeneca shares took heart from Soriot's audacious forecasts.(Additional reporting by Anjuli Davies and Soyoung Kim; Editing by Will Waterman)",2014-05-26,PFE,"Mon May 26, 2014 | 7:09pm EDT",How AstraZeneca escaped Pfizer's clutches this time,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-astrazeneca-pfizer-insight-idUSBREA4P0IN20140526?type=companyNews

AstraZeneca could reach out to Pfizer after three months and Pfizer could take another run at its smaller British rival in six months time, whether it is invited back or not.Pfizer's move came two hours before a 5.00 pm (1200 ET) deadline to make a firm offer or walk away, under UK takeover rules. Its decision to quit the stage, at least for now, had been widely expected after AstraZeneca refused its final offer of 55 pounds a share.""Following the AstraZeneca board's rejection of the proposal, Pfizer announces that it does not intend to make an offer for AstraZeneca,"" Pfizer said in a short news release.The biggest U.S. drugmaker promised it would not go hostile by taking its offer directly to AstraZeneca shareholders, leaving the fate of what would have been the world's largest ever drugs merger in the hands of its target, whose board would have had to make a complete U-turn to get a deal done.""We continue to believe that our final proposal was compelling and represented full value for AstraZeneca based on the information that was available to us,"" said Ian Read, Pfizer's chairman and chief executive.Pfizer's final offer was at a price that many analysts and investors had previously suggested would bring AstraZeneca to the table for serious negotiations. But in rejecting an earlier offer of 53.50 pounds as undervaluing the company, the British group indicated it needed a bid more than 10 percent higher, or at least 58.85 pounds per share, for its board to consider a recommendation.Pfizer had urged AstraZeneca shareholders to agitate for engagement and several expressed disappointment at its intransigence, although others - encouraged by AstraZeneca's promising drug pipeline - backed the firm's standalone strategy.AstraZeneca Chairman Leif Johansson welcomed Pfizer's decision to back down, which he said would allow the British company to focus on its growth potential as an independent company.What happens next will depend upon whether AstraZeneca's share price deteriorates in the coming weeks and how hard its shareholders push for it to revisit a deal with Pfizer. BlackRock, AstraZeneca's biggest shareholder, backed the board's rejection of Pfizer's 55 pounds a share offer, but urged it to talk again in the future.POLITICAL OPPOSITION The proposed transaction ran into fierce opposition from politicians in Britain, Sweden - where AstraZeneca has half it roots - and the United States over the likelihood that the marriage would lead to thousands of job cuts.Ultimately, it was price and the lack of room for eleventh-hour maneuvering by Pfizer that killed the deal. Pfizer had several reasons for taking aim at AstraZeneca for what would have been its fourth mega-merger in 14 years.Highest on the list appeared to be Pfizer's desire to take part in a recent trend of so-called tax inversions, under which it could reincorporate in Britain and pay significantly lower corporate tax. Pfizer would also be able to use tens of billions of dollars it has parked overseas, avoiding high U.S. taxes for repatriating the huge cash pile.Pfizer also had its eye on a promising portfolio of drugs in AstraZeneca's developmental pipeline, especially several potentially lucrative cancer medicines.It was this pipeline that AstraZeneca management used to make its case for Pfizer significantly undervaluing the company.Chief Executive Pascal Soriot went as far as making a 10-year forecast for a 75 percent rise in sales by 2023.""As we said from the start, the pursuit of this transaction was a potential enhancement to our existing strategy,"" Pfizer's Read said.

273,"   By Ana Nicolaci da Costa and Jamie McGeever | LONDON  LONDON May 27 Sterling weakened against the dollar on Tuesday after a fall in British mortgage lending gave investors an excuse to cash in on the pound's recent gains a day after U.S. drug company Pfizer abandoned its attempt to buy Britain's AstraZeneca.Data from the British Bankers' Association painted a mixed picture of the housing market but showed Britain's banks last month approved the lowest number of mortgages since August.One week before the Bank of England releases its own mortgage data for April, the figures cooled some of the fervour surrounding the housing market and tempered some of the more bullish expectations that the BoE could start raising interest rates later this year.The mortgage approvals numbers ""have just underlined the fact that perhaps the housing market might be undergoing (some) deceleration,"" Jeremy Stretch, head of currency strategy at CIBC World Markets.""Also from the equity side, you have that M&A fizz which had been potentially supporting sterling...that has been taken off the agenda at least for the short-term as well. Those two factors together were seen as disappointing somewhat,"" he said, referring to the Pfizer-Astrazenaca saga. Pfizer on Monday walked away from its attempt to buy AstraZeneca for nearly 70 billion pounds but markets were closed that day for holidays in Britain and the United States.Sterling fell to its lowest in more than a week against the dollar to $1.6790, down around a quarter of one percent on the day, while it was off around 0.1 percent against the euro at 81.10 pence per euro.Sterling has been rising steadily since last year, underpinned by expectations that a rapid economic recovery will see the BoE be the first major central bank to raise interest rates, most likely early in 2015 but maybe even sooner. BoE deputy governor Charlie Bean's comments on Sunday that the bank's plan to raise rates gradually means the first hike could come earlier than may otherwise have been the case had underpinned the currency in early trade before the mortgage data.British yields were little changed on the day, with the 10-year yield broadly steady at 2.64 percent and the Gilt future settling 3 ticks lower at 110.87.The yield premium gilts offers over equivalent German Bunds,  however, was 3 basis points higher at 125 bps as recent European Central Bank commentary reinforced the view that the euro zone and UK central banks are on a diverging monetary policy path. ECB President Mario Draghi said on Sunday ""more pre-emptive action may be warranted to ward off deflation"".The pound may still be poised to launch another test of $1.70 against the greenback. The pound traded as high as $1.6996 earlier this month, a level not seen since August 2009.It may be a slow grind higher though, if market positioning is any guide. The latest data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission released on Friday show speculators were net long of sterling to the tune of $3.48 billion.That is the heaviest net long position held by short-term FX trading accounts among major currencies, a reflection that their most bullish bets are for the pound to appreciate. Essentially, the market is already heavily betting this way and there may not be much more upside potential from here on.""Sterling positioning remains the longest of any of the currencies covered here. However, positioning is no longer increasing, which may constitute a significant headwind for the pound,"" JP Morgan strategists wrote in a note on Tuesday.

276,"  * Brokers downgrade stock after Pfizer abandons takeover bid* Shares down 2.3 percent but still above mid-April level   (Adds further broker downgrades, details)By Ben HirschlerLONDON, May 27 Shares in AstraZeneca  fell 2.3 percent on Tuesday after U.S. drugmaker Pfizer  said it would not make a formal bid to acquire its smaller British rival.Pfizer's decision - announced on Monday during a public holiday - had been widely expected after a rejection by AstraZeneca's board of its final offer of 55 pounds a share. Under British takeover rules, AstraZeneca could reach out to Pfizer in three months and Pfizer could take another run at its smaller British rival in six months' time, whether it is invited back or not. But an immediate deal is off the agenda.Pfizer's final offer was at a price that many analysts and investors had previously suggested would bring AstraZeneca to the table for serious negotiations. But in rejecting an earlier offer of 53.50 pounds as undervaluing the company, the British group indicated that it needed a bid more than 10 percent higher, or at least 58.85 pounds per share, for its board to consider a recommendation.Pfizer had urged AstraZeneca shareholders to agitate for engagement and several expressed disappointment at its intransigence, though others - encouraged by AstraZeneca's promising drug pipeline - backed the standalone strategy. The shares fell back to 42.29 pounds by 0820 GMT, still a premium to the undisturbed price of 37.82 pounds before Pfizer's bid interest was first reported in mid-April.Several brokerages, including Societe Generale, Panmure Gordon and Kepler Cheuvreux, cut their recommendations or price targets for AstraZeneca after Pfizer's decision to abandon its attempt to buy the British company.SocGen analyst Stephen McGarry, who downgraded the stock to ""sell"" from ""hold"" and set a price target of 36 pounds a share, said the onus was now on AstraZeneca to deliver on its bullish forecasts for sales to grow 75 percent to $45 billion by 2023.Now that the Pfizer bid has gone, AstraZeneca will need to deliver on its aggressive 2023 targets, he said in a note, adding that SocGen believes the targets are likely to be ""unattainable without AstraZeneca adding to its revenue and profit stream via M&A activity"".

277,"   By Ben Hirschler | LONDON  LONDON On a sunny day in San Francisco last January, AstraZeneca Chief Executive Pascal Soriot was on his way to the Westin St. Francis hotel on Union Square to give investors some unexpectedly good news.After long refusing to put a date on when the British drugmaker's sales figures would pull out of a nosedive, Soriot surprised the market on Jan. 14 with a bold prediction that sales by 2017 would be back at 2013 levels.What shareholders did not know at the time was that two days earlier AstraZeneca had written to U.S. rival Pfizer rejecting its offer to buy the London-based group for close to $100 billion.Shares rose on the 2017 sales forecast as investors looked forward to a time when AstraZeneca would finally put behind it a wave of patent expiries on its drugs. It was a defiant performance by Soriot - CEO for little over a year - whose long-term forecast suggested much of Wall Street had got his firm's valuation all wrong.""Essentially we believe that we can return to growth faster than most people have been forecasting so far,"" he told the annual JP Morgan Healthcare Conference. ""Our next step would be that, by 2020, we want to launch at least 10 new medicines.""The previous week in New York, Frenchman Soriot and Swedish Chairman Leif Johansson had met with Scottish-born Pfizer boss Ian Read and his New Jersey finance head Frank D'Amelio to discuss details of a possible deal in the neutral ground of the Pierre hotel overlooking a snowy Central Park.Those talks in turn had been prefaced by an email and phone call from Read to Johansson proposing a merger on Nov. 25.So both sides had plenty of time to develop a war-game for what was always going to be a politically charged takeover fight, involving the biggest attempted foreign takeover of a British firm and the creation of the world's largest pharmaceuticals group - with a conveniently reduced tax bill.Yet despite a horde of advisers, Pfizer walked away on May 26 empty-handed, exactly four weeks after going public with its bid interest.The fight was actually lost a week earlier after an angry stand-off on Sunday May 18 in which both sides blamed each other for closing down talks on a $118 billion offer that was ""only"" about $8 billion adrift from the price AstraZeneca wanted.UNFINISHED BUSINESS This may not be the end, of course. Under UK takeover rules Pfizer is allowed to make a new approach in November, while AstraZeneca could invite Pfizer back into fresh talks on a new offer at the end of August, if the chorus from its shareholders demanding talks is loud enough. It is a prospect some in the Pfizer camp are keen to talk up. ""Most shareholders seem to think that this transaction is a good value-creating idea and that we are very close on price,"" said one person close to the U.S. firm. ""I'm still hopeful that by the end of the year we will see this combination happening.""A person familiar with the matter in the AstraZeneca camp also admitted: ""It’s still alive. There's still a lot of premium (in the share price).""Whether Pfizer pounces again and AstraZeneca can escape once more depends on Soriot's ability to prove his firm's research labs have what it takes to deliver on his bold promises of growth by 2017 and a 75 percent increase in drug sales by 2023.The first step in doing that involves Soriot climbing on yet another plane to America at the end of the week, this time to Chicago, where his team will showcase the latest clinical data on its cancer drugs at the May 30 to June 3 annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO).AstraZeneca has already reported some good clinical trial results for one new lung cancer drug, known as AZD9291, which will be presented to doctors in full at ASCO.That leaves the biggest question-mark over MEDI4736, a drug designed to fight tumors by tapping the immune system, which is being tested in combination with other medicines and which AstraZeneca reckons could become a $6.5 billion-a-year seller.The quality of the clinical data on MEDI4736 will give investors important clues, but they will also be watching just as closely how similar drugs perform at ASCO from rivals like Roche, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Merck & Co. At the same time, AstraZeneca will look at its own deal-making options, including potential partnership agreements in cancer and other areas. It has already said it is exploring such options in infection and neuroscience.Whatever the news from ASCO and on deals, however, many AstraZeneca investors remain deeply frustrated - and puzzled - at the way the biggest deal in the history of the pharmaceutical industry slipped away this month, depriving them of a windfall.The reasons for that lie in the fraught weekend of May 17-18, when, after two days of grilling for both CEOs in front of two committees of British lawmakers, Pfizer came back with a sweetened offer of 53.50 pounds a share on the Friday night.BRINKMANSHIP Read and his advisers were convinced they had tapped into what AstraZeneca's shareholders were thinking – indeed, Read met again with investors after the hearings - and they were sure they had an offer that would bring their target to the table. That proved to be a miscalculation.The new price certainly got AstraZeneca's attention at a lengthy meeting of its board on May 17 at the London offices of law firm Freshfields, and led to a phone call lasting more than an hour between the two sides on May 18, when AstraZeneca made clear it needed at least 58.85 pounds.Read's last-ditch act of brinkmanship - issuing a final offer of 55 pounds a share, without warning - failed to break the AstraZeneca board's resolve and also failed to trigger a decisive investor rebellion.It was not the script most investors had expected, not least because Pfizer had always got its prey in the past, and the initial maneuvers following its 50 pounds-a-share offer on May 2 also seemed to play out well for the U.S. firm.Pfizer's letter to British Prime Minister David Cameron offering reassurances on jobs and research initially won a warm reception from the government. The political atmosphere then turned hostile for Pfizer, however, and AstraZeneca's fightback - playing up its revitalized pipeline of cancer drugs - brought some solid support from a few vocal investors.What happens next will depend on how much pressure Soriot and his team face from shareholders, some of whom are already demanding that management pay packages be linked to the company's shares reaching the 55 pounds share price that Pfizer had offered or the 58.85 that AstraZeneca reckons it is worth.Investor ambivalence is highlighted by BlackRock, the biggest shareholder, which backed the board’s dismissal of Pfizer on price, but also wants more talks down the road.AstraZeneca always said it was ready to talk if Pfizer offered the right price, but it also insisted that key execution risks had to be addressed or eliminated, principally Pfizer's controversial plan to make Britain its tax base, without which the financial logic of the deal would collapse.Things reached a nadir in the eyes of many of those involved when Soriot told lawmakers that a merger could cost lives by delaying vital new cancer drugs, a statement one person on Pfizer's side described as ""poisoning the well"".So could things have turned out differently? Yes, according to one source in the AstraZeneca camp, who said Pfizer should simply have moved faster. Read was right to spot the promise of AstraZeneca's cancer pipeline but too slow to act.The real tactical error, he said, was not to have gone with a bid in November or pushed harder in January, before AstraZeneca shares took heart from Soriot's audacious forecasts.

278,"   By Ben Hirschler and Bill Berkrot | LONDON/NEW YORK  LONDON/NEW YORK Pfizer abandoned its attempt to buy AstraZeneca for nearly 70 billion pounds ($118 billion) on Monday as a deadline approached without a last-minute change of heart by the British drugmaker.The decision ends a month-long public fight between two of the world's biggest pharmaceutical companies that sparked political concerns on both sides of Atlantic over jobs and corporate tax maneuvers.British rules now require an enforced cooling-off period. AstraZeneca could reach out to Pfizer after three months and Pfizer could take another run at its smaller British rival in six months time, whether it is invited back or not.Pfizer's move came two hours before a 5.00 p.m. (12.00 p.m. ET) deadline to make a firm offer or walk away, under UK takeover rules. Its decision to quit the stage, at least for now, had been widely expected after AstraZeneca refused its final offer of 55 pounds a share. ""Following the AstraZeneca board's rejection of the proposal, Pfizer announces that it does not intend to make an offer for AstraZeneca,"" Pfizer said in a short news release. The biggest U.S. drugmaker promised it would not go hostile by taking its offer directly to AstraZeneca shareholders, leaving the fate of what would have been the world's largest ever drugs merger in the hands of its target, whose board would have had to make a complete U-turn to get a deal done.  ""We continue to believe that our final proposal was compelling and represented full value for AstraZeneca based on the information that was available to us,"" said Ian Read, Pfizer's chairman and chief executive.Pfizer's final offer was at a price that many analysts and investors had previously suggested would bring AstraZeneca to the table for serious negotiations.     But in rejecting an earlier offer of 53.50 pounds as undervaluing the company, the British group indicated it needed a bid more than 10 percent higher, or at least 58.85 pounds per share, for its board to consider a recommendation.Pfizer had urged AstraZeneca shareholders to agitate for engagement and several expressed disappointment at its intransigence, although others - encouraged by AstraZeneca's promising drug pipeline - backed the firm's standalone strategy. AstraZeneca Chairman Leif Johansson welcomed Pfizer's decision to back down, which he said would allow the British company to focus on its growth potential as an independent company.What happens next will depend upon whether AstraZeneca's share price deteriorates in the coming weeks and how hard its shareholders push for it to revisit a deal with Pfizer.     BlackRock, AstraZeneca's biggest shareholder, backed the board’s rejection of Pfizer's 55 pounds a share offer, but urged it to talk again in the future. POLITICAL OPPOSITION    The proposed transaction ran into fierce opposition from politicians in Britain, Sweden - where AstraZeneca has half it roots -  and the United States over the likelihood that the marriage would lead to thousands of job cuts.     Ultimately, it was price and the lack of room for eleventh-hour maneuvering by Pfizer that killed the deal.    Pfizer had several reasons for taking aim at AstraZeneca for what would have been its fourth mega-merger in 14 years.     Highest on the list appeared to be Pfizer's desire to take part in a recent trend of so-called tax inversions, under which it could reincorporate in Britain and pay significantly lower corporate tax. Pfizer would also be able to use tens of billions of dollars it has parked overseas, avoiding high U.S. taxes for repatriating the huge cash pile.    Pfizer also had its eye on a promising portfolio of drugs in AstraZeneca's developmental pipeline, especially several potentially lucrative cancer medicines.     It was this pipeline that AstraZeneca management used to make its case for Pfizer significantly undervaluing the company.  Chief Executive Pascal Soriot went as far as making a 10-year forecast for a 75 percent rise in sales by 2023.""As we said from the start, the pursuit of this transaction was a potential enhancement to our existing strategy,"" Pfizer's Read said. ""We will continue our focus on the execution of our plans, bringing forth new treatments to meet patients’ needs and remaining responsible stewards of our shareholders’ capital.”The merger would have restored Pfizer as the world's largest drugmaker by sales, a position it relinquished to Swiss-based Novartis when billions of dollars in annual revenue evaporated after its top-selling cholesterol fighter Lipitor began facing generic competition in 2011.

280,"  (Corrects to Reimbursement Intelligence from Intelligence Reimbursement, to Whang as co-president from president, to Steve Miller from Stuart Miller)By Caroline Humer and Deena BeasleyNEW YORK/LOS ANGELES May 28 Shocked by the rapid adoption of a new $84,000 hepatitis C treatment, U.S. health insurers are trying to make sure they aren't blindsided by other drugs being developed and are looking for ways to limit their use from the day they are launched.Manufacturer Gilead Sciences Inc says 30,000 people have received hepatitis drug Sovaldi so far, and that sales hit a record-breaking $2.3 billion within a few months. The treatment, typically 84 pills taken over 12 weeks, completely cures the disease in more than 90 percent of patients.As many as 3.2 million Americans are infected by hepatitis C, and the cost of giving most of them Sovaldi would surpass $200 billion. Some insurers have already put conditions on who can get the drug, and states including California and Texas have slowed or put treatment on hold while they study what to do.Insurers warned that these unforeseen costs will cut 2014 earnings and require rate hikes. Now, at industry conferences, in conversations with investors, and in private, they are pushing Gilead's rivals, a group that includes AbbVie Inc , Merck & Co and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co , to discount their own new hepatitis C treatments when they come to market starting this fall. Such a high-profile campaign by insurers before drugs are even approved is new.They are also signaling they will restrict who can get coverage for new cholesterol drugs being developed by Amgen Inc , Pfizer Inc and a partnership of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc and Sanofi SA.By law, insurers cannot deny access to new drugs if they represent a real improvement for patients, leaving drug companies with the upper hand in most price discussions. When comparable competitors, or a generic version is on the market about a decade later, insurers have room to steer patients away from the new drugs, and pharmaceutical companies cut prices steeply and give big discounts.But insurers have not faced such a highly effective drug aimed at a widespread disease that is so expensive and so quickly adopted. The previous record for a drug reaching blockbuster status was set in 2011, when hepatitis C therapy Incivek from Vertex Pharmaceuticals raked in $1.56 billion for the entire year. Sovaldi has sold more in a quarter of the time.As a result, insurers are taking a harder line on which patients should get Sovaldi, based on the drug's clinical data.Sovaldi is ""game-changing"" for insurers' thinking, said John Whang, co-president of Reimbursement Intelligence, a consulting firm that helps pharmaceutical companies set prices. The only way for them to respond is to control the volume of treatment used, he said.PUBLIC SHAMING  In a sign of how serious the industry has become, the largest insurer lobby group last week took Gilead to task at a public conference.""The company in this case is asking for a blank check and you can't give anyone anymore a blank check because it will blow up family budgets, state Medicaid budgets, employer costs and wreak havoc on the federal debt,"" said Karen Ignagni, president of America's Health Insurance Plans.Gilead argues that Sovaldi's price is worth it, since it will replace even costlier spending on hospital visits and treatments for cirrhosis or liver failure. It has not budged on price for the hepatitis C drug, although Gregg Alton, Gilead's executive vice president for corporate and medical affairs, acknowledged that insurers are going to start negotiating.U.S. drug spending reached a record $329 billion in 2013, driven by a double-digit increase in prices for new cancer, HIV and hepatitis C therapies. Express Scripts, the nation's largest pharmacy benefit manager, expects spending on such specialty drugs to rise an additional 63 percent from 2014 to 2016, driven by an 1,800 percent increase in hepatitis C drug costs.Successful drugs can cost $1 billion to bring to market, including spending on research, development and marketing. Supporters of drug companies say big advances necessitate high prices.""We are the only country in the world that pays exorbitant prices to provide innovation first here, but that's what we need and that's what the American people have come to expect,"" said Richard Burr, a Republican Senator from North Carolina who has spent decades working on bipartisan health bills.LIMITING USE  Hepatitis C complications can take years to develop, which gives insurers and government health agencies leeway to determine when treatment should start.Many insurers, which manage most of the 150 million people covered by employer-based plans as well as some government Medicare and Medicaid plans, require patients to get authorization before using Sovaldi. Some limit the drug to patients with a certain genetic type of the disease.Express Scripts has been pushing for all but the sickest patients to wait for new therapies that are expected to compete head-to-head with Sovaldi late this year. It is also pressing rival manufacturers for low prices, hoping to avoid the shock of Sovaldi, which sped through trials and regulatory approval and caught insurers by surprise.""In this particular case there was very little discussion pre-launch. But other companies are now already discussing potential future price points in response,"" said Steve Miller, Express Scripts Chief Medical Officer.AbbVie and Merck both declined to comment on whether discussions with insurers about their new drugs were underway.Gilead, which says it discussed the Sovaldi launch with insurers, is in talks over which patients should be treated with its next hepatitis C pill. That will be a two-drug combination that will eliminate the need for a companion drug that nearly doubles Sovaldi's current total cost. Industry analysts expect the company will price it closer to Sovaldi's $84,000 than to the $150,000 cost of a combination of Sovaldi and a Johnson & Johnson drug that some doctors prescribe.Mick Kolassa, chairman of pricing consultancy Medical Marketing Economics, in Oxford, Mississippi, who advises pharma companies, says insurers are being aggressive. ""We are seeing some of them step up and flex their muscles,"" he said.CHOLESTEROL DRUGS IN SIGHT More scrutiny of new pricing is likely ahead as the country comes to terms with how it should pay for expensive drugs, according to John Castellani, Chief Executive Officer of leading drug industry lobby group Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America or PhRMA.Sovaldi has shown that patients are bearing too much of the drug's costs because of rising co-payments, co-insurance and deductibles, he told Reuters, laying the blame on factors controlled by insurance companies.But patient advocates are not choosing sides yet, which may have the effect of giving insurers room for action.""I think the fault lies with both the for-profit insurers and the drug companies,"" said Anne Donnelly, director of healthcare policy at the San Francisco-based Project Inform, which advocates for hepatitis C patients. The system has not changed to reflect the impact of new effective, expensive drugs, she said.The next big price battle centers on a new class of cholesterol drugs known as PCSK9 inhibitors, which help the liver to clear ""bad"" LDL cholesterol from the blood.Large-scale studies show the new drugs can help patients who cannot tolerate, or get enough benefit from, the most widely-used cholesterol drugs, statins. The PCSK9 therapies are expected to cost thousands of dollars a year, far above the price of statins sold as generics.Drugmakers are expected to push for the new medicines to be used by 7 million to 20 million people, or up to 30 percent of the 71 million Americans with high cholesterol. Insurers already are questioning whether the estimates of use are legitimate.""There is really no need to take these new medications and spread them out across a larger community of people who will respond to existing treatments, many of which are generic,"" Aetna Inc's National Medical Director for Pharmacy Policy Ed Pezalla said in an interview.

285,"  (Adds comment from plaintiffs' lawyer and company's denial of liability)May 28 German drugmaker Boehringer Ingelheim said on Wednesday it would pay about $650 million to settle U.S. lawsuits that claimed the company's blockbuster blood thinner, Pradaxa, had caused severe and fatal bleeding in patients.Boehringer said it expected to resolve about 4,000 claims with the settlement. The claimants had accused the company of not issuing sufficient warnings of the risks associated with Pradaxa.While Boehringer denied liability, it said the deal would allow it to avoid the distraction and uncertainty of a lengthy litigation process. ""BI stands resolutely behind Pradaxa and believed from the outset that the plaintiffs' claims lacked merit,"" said Desiree Ralls-Morrison, senior vice president and general counsel, Boehringer Ingelheim USA Corp. A lawyer for the plaintiffs, Mikal Watts, said he was hopeful that claimants would receive compensation within a year as lawyers move to implement the settlement. The amount each individual receives will vary depending on the severity and nature of the alleged injury, he added.""I think it's a good settlement for a lot of people that need help,"" Watts said.

286,"  May 31 A combination of two drugs developed by AstraZeneca Plc, olaparib and cediranib, was shown in a mid-stage study to nearly double the length of time certain ovarian cancer patients lived without their disease getting worse.After spurning a $118 billion takeover approach from Pfizer Inc, Britain's AstraZeneca is aiming to show investors at this weekend's meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology in Chicago that its pipeline of cancer drugs offers an opportunity for future sales growth.The 90-patient study is the first to look at a drug that blocks a cell repair enzyme known as PARP, olaparib, together with a drug designed to prevent the formation of blood vessels needed by tumors, cediranib, for treating ovarian cancer.It demonstrated progression-free survival of 17.7 months with the combination treatment, compared with 9 months for olaparib alone. Patients in the trial had recurrent cancer that had initially responded to treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy or had cancer related to the BRCA gene. Side effects, including high blood pressure, fatigue and diarrhea, occurred more frequently in patients treated with the combination therapy. Researchers said past trials of standard chemotherapy in the same patient population have shown progression-free survival of between eight and 13 months.Platinum-based chemotherapy is one of the main treatments used for ovarian cancer. However, it can make patients very sick and typically loses effectiveness over time. ""The significant activity that we saw with the combination suggests that this could potentially be an effective alternative to standard chemotherapy,"" Dr Joyce Liu, the study's lead author and an oncologist at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, said in a statement.AstraZeneca has projected that sales of olaparib could reach $2 billion a year, but Wall Street estimates are lower. Leerink forecast sales of the drug at $900 million in 2026.

289,"  (Corrects typo in headline to read 'AstraZeneca' and not 'AztraZeneca')By Deena BeasleyCHICAGO, June 3 AstraZeneca Plc, in the headlines for spurning buyout offers from Pfizer Inc, aims to regain prominence in oncology with compelling trial results and a splashy exhibit booth at the world's largest meeting of cancer doctors.The company is seen as No. 4 in a race to develop the first drug in a new class that fights cancer by unleashing the body's immune system, behind rivals Roche, Merck & Co  and Bristol-Myers Squibb.In a presentation during the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting in Chicago, Chief Executive Officer Pascal Soriot said AstraZeneca was progressing faster than he had expected with its cancer drug pipeline - an asset that figured prominently in its decision to rebuff Pfizer.""We remain resolute in our ambition to bring these next-generation cancer medicines to patients as fast as possible,"" Soriot said in an investor presentation late on Monday.Wall Street analysts said data at the ASCO conference, which started on Friday and will end on Tuesday, provided evidence that AstraZeneca has made progress. A 2 percent rise in the company's London-listed shares since the meeting began suggests no major disappointments.""This is more like confirmation than anything revolutionary,"" said Les Funtleyder, a consulting partner with U.K.-based Bluecloud Healthcare consulting firm. Pfizer walked away from a takeover bid on May 26. The U.S. drugmaker can be invited back to talks by AstraZeneca, Britain's second-largest pharmaceuticals company, in three months or make a fresh approach on its own in six months under UK rules.AstraZeneca became known in recent years more for cholesterol drug Crestor and ulcer pill Nexium, which are both due to lose patent protection soon.The company, which seeks a return to a leading role in oncology, broke new ground decades ago by developing tamoxifen and other hormonal therapies that are still widely used to treat breast cancer and prostate cancer.AstraZeneca also developed one of the first ""targeted"" cancer drugs, Iressa. It was pulled from the U.S. market after a large clinical trial showed no survival benefit in lung cancer. The company's prominent front-row exhibit booth at the ASCO meeting had an airy space-age feel with videos on monitors describing its experimental drugs. Long lines formed for free fruit smoothies.""It's a bigger booth than AstraZeneca has had in the past,"" said Briggs Morrison, the company's chief medical officer. ""Our intent is to make people know how serious we are.""In all, AstraZeneca presented data from over 40 scientific abstracts for experimental cancer drugs. It said that one of its most closely watched therapies, MEDI4736, may be safer than some rivals, allowing it to be used at higher doses in combination with other drugs. AstraZeneca acquired the drug in its 2007 takeover of U.S.-based MedImmune. A study funded by the National Cancer Institute showed a combination of two AstraZeneca drugs - olaparib, which blocks a cell-repair enzyme known as PARP, and cediranib, which prevents formation of blood vessels needed by tumors - extended the length of time that ovarian cancer patients lived without getting worse.Both drugs had been effectively shelved by AstraZeneca after initial clinical trials produced underwhelming results.""If that happened today, we would never have walked away,"" said Bahija Jallal, AstraZeneca's executive vice president, global medicines development. ""The culture today is to follow the science.""Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez called the ovarian cancer data the biggest upside surprise at the conference, noting that the drug combination might eventually replace chemotherapy, which would double olaparib's potential sales.MEDI4736 is part of a closely watched class of drugs known as anti-PD-L1 therapies, which block a tumor's ability to evade the immune system's defenses. A small study in lung cancer patients who tested positive for PD-L1, presented on Tuesday, showed that 39 percent responded to MEDI4736.AstraZeneca expects that more data looking at a combination of MEDI4736 and tremelimumab in lung cancer will be presented in September at the annual meeting of the European Society for Medical Oncology.Investors are eager to see whether those results improve upon disappointing lung cancer data from Bristol-Myers, whose combination of melanoma treatment Yervoy and PD-L1 drug nivolumab produced lower-than-expected response rates and a high rate of side effects.

293,"   By Andrew Longstreth | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Within the next two weeks, the U.S. Supreme Court is expected to rule in a major case that could make it much harder for shareholders to band together against public companies in securities fraud class actions. If the court rules in favor of Halliburton (HAL.N) and against a group of shareholders, then the oilfield services company won't be the only business to gain. A handful of other major companies would also likely reap immediate benefit.Those companies, including drug makers Merck & Co Inc (MRK.N) and Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), banks HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA.L) and Regions Financial Corp (RF.N), and casino company Las Vegas Sands Corp (LVS.N), are defendants in shareholder lawsuits that have been granted class action status. A decision setting a higher bar for class actions would not end the lawsuits, but it would allow these defendants to file briefs demanding that shareholders have to again seek court approval for the status - and this time under a new, tougher standard. If they fail to get that approval, the cases would effectively end.In 2013, settlements were reached in 67 cases totaling $4.8 billion, according to Cornerstone Research. A ruling in the oil company's favor in Halliburton v. Erica P. John Fund could save other businesses facing pending class actions hundreds of millions of dollars collectively. Around 200 shareholder class actions are filed every year alleging that misleading statements and material omissions made by companies and their executives caused a stock’s share price to drop. Nearly 400 shareholder securities class actions are  pending in various stages of litigation, according to data gathered by the Stanford Law School Securities Class Action Clearinghouse.But only a relatively small number of the pending cases have been granted class action status. In each instance, a judge must determine at a certification hearing whether the status is appropriate. One consideration is whether the people in the class have common issues or merely related ones. To be a class, they must have common issues.'FRAUD ON THE MARKET' Class certification is a critical stage in shareholder class actions because it puts pressure on defendants to settle by increasing the liability they face. Generally, the larger the class size, the more damages a company faces and the more that plaintiffs' lawyers can make. Law firms can receive as much as a third of the settlement in attorneys' fees.In the case before the Supreme Court, Halliburton is seeking to overturn a 1988 decision, Basic v. Levinson, which adopted the “fraud on the market theory.” Under the theory, a defendant's material misrepresentation that affects the price of publicly traded securities is presumed to have been relied on by a purchaser who suffered a loss.That theory assumes public information about a company is known to the market and plaintiffs do not have to show that they relied on a specific misrepresentation, only that they purchased shares before the truth came out.In the case against Halliburton, shareholders alleged it understated asbestos liabilities while overstating both  revenues in its engineering and construction business and the benefits of its merger with Dresser Industries. The court has several options, including leaving intact Basic v. Levinson to maintain the status quo. At the other extreme, it could overturn Basic v. Levinson - and so doom securities class actions by requiring plaintiffs to show they relied on misinformation when they purchased securities. A third option would be to find a middle ground that would require plaintiffs to show that the misrepresentation had a significant effect on the stock price but that would not overturn Basic. During oral arguments, some of the justices appeared to signal that the middle option would be their preference. The middle option would still be a win for the defendant corporations by creating more hurdles for shareholders to clear before being allowed to sue as a group.Merck is facing one of the largest pending shareholder cases that already has class action status. The lawsuit, filed in 2005, alleges that the company made misleading statements about its painkiller drug Vioxx, which the company withdrew from the market in 2004 over concerns that it increased the risk of heart attacks and strokes. The plaintiffs alleged that after Merck disclosed the problems with Vioxx, its market capitalization shrunk by billions of dollars.In January 2013, U.S. District Judge Stanley Chesler of New Jersey certified a class of individuals and entities who purchased Merck securities from May 21, 1999, to Sept. 29, 2004. HALT IN THE PROCEEDINGS Foreshadowing the potential impact of the Halliburton decision, a lawyer for Merck in November asked a federal judge in New Jersey to put a halt to proceedings in the case pending the outcome of the Supreme Court decision in Halliburton. The lawyer said the plaintiffs’ case rested squarely on the fraud on the market theory and that part of the case would likely have to be re-litigated following the Halliburton decision. The court denied the request. Merck and an attorney for the plaintiffs had no comment on the potential impact of Halliburton on the case.HSBC could also benefit from the Supreme Court’s ruling. The bank is appealing a $2.46 billion judgment against one of the company’s units, formerly known as Household International Inc. The plaintiffs alleged that Household was engaged in systemic predatory lending and that it misrepresented the credit quality of its loan portfolio.The judgment, entered by a federal judge in Chicago last year, was the largest ever following a securities fraud class action trial, according to the plaintiffs’ law firm.On appeal to the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, lawyers for HSBC are seeking an order vacating the judgment and sending the case back to the district court. In a brief filed in February, HSBC said that if the Supreme Court jettisons Basic’s presumption of reliance on a misrepresentation, a class status review ""will be beyond question.”Pfizer is facing a trial later this year over allegations made by shareholders that it fraudulently misrepresented the safety of its Celebrex and Bextra pain-relieving drugs. The lawsuit covers investors who bought Pfizer stock between Oct. 31, 2000, and Oct. 19, 2005, a period in which the company's share price fell by roughly half and its market value tumbled by well over $100 billion.Pfizer and the plaintiffs agreed to delay the trial until after the Halliburton decision. In a letter to the court, Pfizer said it believed that after the Halliburton decision, it “may be necessary to revisit class certification or other pre-trial motion practice.”",2014-06-12,PFE,"Thu Jun 12, 2014 | 11:35am EDT","Merck, Pfizer, HSBC could be big winners from shareholder case",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-usa-court-halliburton-analysis-idUSKBN0EN10620140612?type=companyNews
294,"  * Synairgen gets $7.25 mln now, milestones up to $225 mln* Deal bolsters Astra's key respiratory medicine business* Continues bolt-on dealmaking after Pfizer's failed bid* Synairgen shares jump 46 percent   (Adds jump in Synairgen shares, more on Pfizer bid approach)By Ben HirschlerLONDON, June 12 AstraZeneca has struck a deal worth up to $232 million in milestone payments to acquire rights to a drug from Synairgen for treating respiratory tract viral infections in patients with severe asthma. Britain's second-biggest drugmaker - subject of a $118 billion bid by Pfizer that failed last month - said on Thursday it would pay UK-based Synairgen a $7.25 million upfront fee and potential development, regulatory and commercial milestones of up to $225 million for rights to the drug, codenamed SNG001.The deal, which sent in shares in Synairgen surging 46 percent by 0740 GMT, marks a continuation of AstraZeneca's strategy of striking bolt-on product licensing deals in key therapeutic areas, such as respiratory medicine.Some analysts have speculated AstraZeneca might also consider a much larger acquisition to try to see off the threat of a renewed Pfizer approach. But others believe the British firm will come under pressure from shareholders to revive talks with its larger U.S. rival. Under British takeover law, AstraZeneca can reach out to Pfizer in late August to discuss a sweetened bid, or Pfizer could make renewed overtures in November, whether it is invited back or not.Pfizer Chief Financial Officer Frank D'Amelio, speaking to the Goldman Sachs annual healthcare conference on Wednesday, said talks about a deal with AstraZeneca had fallen down over price, rather than any other issues.Synairgen's SNG001 is an inhaled interferon beta medicine that was originally invented at the University of Southampton, southern England. AstraZeneca plans to start a mid-stage Phase IIa study with the drug in early 2015 in patients with severe asthma, building on results from an initial Phase lla trial in a broad asthma population.Severe asthma is a growing focus for major drugmakers, which are looking to a range of novel biotech medicines to help difficult-to-treat patients.""SNG001 is an innovative and targeted therapy that has, if successful, the potential to offer a step-change in the treatment of severe asthma, and possibly COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease),"" said Maarten Kraan, AstraZeneca's head of respiratory, inflammation and autoimmune medicines.In addition to making milestone payments and covering the future development costs for SNG001, AstraZeneca will also pay tiered royalties ranging from a single-digit up to mid-teens percentage rate on any eventual commercial sales.Synairgen shares were up 24 pence or 45 percent at 76.03p by 0749 GMT, having risen as high as 85.95p, their highest since 2006.

The news sent shares in Cellectis surging 50 percent higher, valuing the company, which was founded in 1999, at around 195 million euros ($264 million).Boosting the body's immune system to fight tumours is a hot area for drug research and was one of the factors that attracted Pfizer to Britain's AstraZeneca - along with the potential to cut costs and taxes.The technology used by Cellectis involves reprogramming immune system cells to hunt out cancer and represents a different approach to that used by drugs under development at AstraZeneca.The French company's research is still at an early stage but it hopes to start clinical trials in 2015, initially with a drug for leukaemia that it has already partnered with unlisted pharmaceuticals group Servier.Under the new deal, Cellectis will receive an upfront payment from Pfizer of $80 million, as well as funding for research costs. The French biotech firm will also be eligible to get development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments of up to $185 million per Pfizer product, plus tiered royalties on any eventual sales.Pfizer has exclusive rights to develop products against 15 biological targets for fighting cancer it selects, while another 12 targets can be selected by Cellectis.In addition, Pfizer will buy a stake of about 10 percent in Cellectis through newly issued shares at 9.25 euros each.  Cellectis is developing Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cell, or CAR-T, immunotherapies using engineered cells from a single donor for use in multiple patients.This so-called allogeneic approach is in contrast to other autologous technologies that rely on engineering a patient's own T-cells and the aim is to make it possible to treat cancer using a standardised, off-the-shelf therapeutic product.Pfizer's research head Mikael Dolsten said he believed that combining the French group's skills with Pfizer's experience in developing cancer drugs would create ""a world-class partnership."" Cellectis said it expected to open a site in the United States to work more closely with scientists at Pfizer.Novartis currently leads the field in CAR-T drug development, with autologous products in clinical trials for leukaemia, lymphoma, mesothelioma and pancreatic cancer.The Swiss drugmaker highlighted the potential of such treatments in fighting tumours both in the blood and solid organs in a presentation to investors on Wednesday.

304,"  * U.S. experts vote against accelerated approval of olaparib* Research productivity central in defence to Pfizer bid* AstraZeneca mis-steps may revive prospects of takeoverBy Ben HirschlerLONDON, June 26 A vote by U.S. experts against accelerated approval of a new ovarian cancer drug from AstraZeneca has dented its claims of research prowess, which were used to see off a $118 billion bid from Pfizer .In itself, the setback will have little impact on earnings prospects - but it coincides with heightened scrutiny of the British drugmaker's research and development (R&D) machine and continued talk that Pfizer may return if it stumbles.Pfizer backed off last month after AstraZeneca trumpeted its drug pipeline and predicted sales would climb 75 percent to $45 billion by 2023 - a highly ambitious target.But many shareholders are unhappy that the Anglo-Swedish group did not engage with Pfizer and problems with important new drugs may stir discontent.The U.S. group could revive its plan later this year to forge the world's biggest drugmaker, in a move that would also cut its tax bill through moving its tax base to Britain. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee (ODAC) said on Wednesday that AstraZeneca should be required to submit further clinical data before its experimental medicine olaparib is approved.""The rejection by ODAC comes at a critical time because failed R&D efforts may make AstraZeneca shareholders more inclined to push AstraZeneca into Pfizer's arms,"" said Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson. ""Every bit of slippage at the company probably does tilt the balance slightly more in favour of a future Pfizer-AstraZeneca tie-up.""Anderson sees a less than 50 percent chance of either AstraZeneca inviting Pfizer back to talks or the U.S. company returning with a higher offer, but said the situation remained fluid. Other analysts are more upbeat on a deal.BNP Paribas said in a research note this week that an increased offer of around $127 billion would still make economic sense, while Jefferies earlier this month predicted an 80 percent probability of AstraZeneca inviting Pfizer back after an enforced cooling-off period ends in late August. DEAL HIATUS Given the present hiatus, many hedge funds have switched attention away from AstraZeneca to the likes of AbbVie's  attempt to buy Shire, industry sources said.Other factors could also encourage or deter Pfizer's renewed interest, including any move by AstraZeneca to make a large acquisition of its own or dispose of certain drugs. The company has already said it is partnering talks for an experimental Alzheimer's medicine. Cancer is the most valuable element in AstraZeneca's pipeline and earlier this month it received generally positive feedback when experimental findings with new treatments were presented at a major U.S. conference.But the real test for new drugs is winning approval from regulators and getting prescriptions written by doctors.AstraZeneca said it was disappointed by the ODAC decision, which means it is likely to have to wait for further clinical trial data due at the end of 2015, rather than getting a hoped-for green light in October.Seamus Fernandez, an analyst at Leerink, said the decision was a surprise and would substantially narrow AstraZeneca's lead over smaller rivals Tesaro and Clovis, which are also developing similar so-called PARP inhibitor drugs.AstraZeneca has flagged olaparib as a potential $2 billion-a-year seller, although some industry analysts see sales at less than half that amount.A company spokeswoman said the monotherapy use of olaparib for ovarian cancer assessed by the U.S. expert panel this week was only one element of a broad development programme.AstraZeneca is also assessing olaparib in combination with another medicine called cediranib, as well as looking at it as a potential therapy for breast and gastric cancers.

309,"   By James Davey | LONDON  LONDON U.S. baby product retailer Destination Maternity will continue its pursuit of Britain's Mothercare after revealing on Wednesday it had two bid proposals rejected.Mothercare confirmed it had spurned an increased offer proposal from Destination Maternity of 300 pence a share that valued the UK company at 266 million pounds ($453 million).    That proposal on June 1 implied a premium of 29 percent to Mothercare's closing share price on Tuesday of 232.5 pence. Mothercare shares were up 11 percent at 259 pence by 1100 GMT.Destination Maternity CEO Ed Krell said: ""We are seeking to engage with the board of Mothercare on a constructive basis with the goal of completing a recommended transaction."" He said there was a compelling rationale for a combination of the two companies.Destination Maternity's 300 pence proposal comprised 230 pence in cash and shares valued at 70 pence in a new holding company that would be listed on the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq but incorporated in the UK, and which would also own the U.S. firm's existing business.    That structure would allow the U.S. firm to benefit from Britain's lower company tax rate compared with the United States. Britain's corporate tax rate has already attracted other U.S. predators, including drug company Pfizer, which failed in an attempt to takeover rival AstraZeneca. Mothercare said it rejected Destination Maternity's proposal on June 3, saying it ""significantly undervalued Mothercare and its attractive prospects,"" and had ""significant transaction execution risks,"" given the proposed transaction structure and tax inversion.Under Britain's takeover rules Destination Maternity has been given until July 30 to announce a firm intention to make an offer for Mothercare, or walk away.   ""While the offer price should be attractive to shareholders, an initial look at Destination does not suggest to us that it would be an easy deal for Destination to digest,"" analysts at Liberum said. ""This could draw out other potential bidders.""      Mothercare, hit hard by cut-price competition from supermarket groups and online retailers in its main UK market, issued a profit warning in January and prior to Wednesday its shares were down 41 percent so far this year. The company, which has more than 1,200 stores worldwide, has been trying to fight back by revamping UK stores, closing weaker ones and expanding online and abroad.     It had aimed to make a profit on its loss-making British operations by 2015, but said in January that 2016 to 2017 was now more realistic. Nasdaq-listed Destination Maternity, which trades from over 1,900 retail locations, has a market value of 316 million pounds. Its shares have fallen 23 percent so far this year.Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Mike Dennis noted that the economic value of Destination Maternity's bid proposal was 381 million pounds - 266 million pounds in equity, average net debt of 65 million pounds and a pension deficit of 49.7 million pounds.

310,"  * U.S. drugmaker urges deal in talks with Shire shareholders* Reiterates desire to engage in negotiations with Shire* No indication on possibility of raising $46 billion offer* Low-profile approach contrasts with Pfizer move on AstraBy Ben HirschlerLONDON, July 3 AbbVie Chief Executive Richard Gonzalez has pressed the case for his $46 billion pursuit of drugmaker Shire in discreet meetings with shareholders in London this week and is now weighing his next move, according to people familiar with the matter.Shire shareholders who met with Gonzalez said he had reiterated the case for a deal, arguing that AbbVie would create more value from Shire's assets than the hyperactivity and rare diseases specialist could do on its own.One person described the meeting he attended as fairly uneventful, with AbbVie giving no indication on the possibility of raising its offer - a move widely expected in order to get the deal done. Gonzalez, who under British takeover rules has until July 18 to make a firm bid for Shire or walk away, has flown back to Chicago for the U.S. long holiday weekend.AbbVie declined to comment on the meetings.Shire has rejected three separate proposals from the U.S. group, arguing the last offer of 46.26 pounds a share in cash and stock fundamentally undervalued the company. While AbbVie has yet to budge on price since Reuters first revealed its bid interest on June 19, it has stated that a deal at 46.26 would lift its earnings ""materially"" - a comment taken by analysts as a signal that it can afford to pay more.""I'm certainly expecting a revised offer - they are not going to come to the shareholders like this and then disappear,"" said Navid Malik, head of life sciences research at Cenkos Securities, who has a 52 pounds target for the shares.Shire shares were 0.8 percent higher at 45.81 pounds by 0825 GMT.Sources familiar with the situation said Gonzalez was ready to consider bidding more but first wanted to explain his case direct to major Shire shareholders and urge them to put pressure on Shire to engage, while also getting to hear their views on valuation. AbbVie has already made clear it wants to start serious talks with Shire and gain access to its books to get more clarity on sales prospects for certain key drugs, although it has not ruled out going hostile.In contrast to Pfizer's recent high-profile - and  unsuccessful - bid for AstraZeneca, AbbVie's pursuit of Shire is much more low key, reflecting the U.S. company's publicity-shy nature and the lack of a big political dimension to the proposed takeover.Gonzalez has eschewed media interviews during his round of meetings with investors this week.""One of the challenges with the Pfizer situation was it was very high profile because of the size of the deal and the large infrastructure AstraZeneca has in the UK,"" Malik said. ""AbbVie is taking a more discreet approach.""Shire, while founded in Britain, is today managed out of Boston, headquartered in Dublin and has most of its sales in the United States, resulting in a minimal business footprint in Britain.AbbVie is eager to buy Shire, both to reduce taxation by redomiciling in Britain - a tactic known as inversion - and to diversify its drug portfolio. The U.S. company currently gets nearly 60 percent of its revenue from rheumatoid arthritis drug Humira, the world's top-selling medicine, which loses U.S. patent protection in late 2016.

314,"  (Corrects 10th paragraph to show Pfizer bought Warner Lambert, Pharmacia and Wyeth (not Pfizer)By Ransdell PiersonJuly 24 Eli Lilly and Co's quarterly revenue plunged due to generic competition for its Cymbalta depression drug and its Evista osteoporosis treatment, but cost controls helped earnings beat forecasts.Lilly on Thursday said it had earned 68 cents per share in the second quarter, above the analysts' average forecast of 65 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Sales of Cymbalta, which lost U.S. patent protection in December, tumbled 73 percent to $401 million. Evista, which began facing cheaper generics in March, had a sales drop of 61 percent to $108 million.The Indianapolis drugmaker's sales and earnings have been badly hurt since late 2011, when its top-selling Zyprexa schizophrenia drug lost U.S. patent protection and faced competition from cheaper generics.The expiration of patents and resulting decline in revenue have been a problem for most U.S. drugmakers and are among the reasons for a surge in mergers and acquisitions in the sector. But rather than attempt to merge with another big drugmaker, Lilly has vowed to remain independent and rely on its own product lineup to get back on track.Chief Executive Officer John Lechleiter told CNBC on Thursday that he planned to stick with that strategy and selectively make small or mid-size acquisitions to bolster Lilly's drug pipeline.By contrast, Pfizer Inc, which faces looming patent expirations on several big drugs and has developed few top sellers in recent years, has tried several times since November to buy AstraZeneca Plc. It officially abandoned that quest in May, but under British takeover law could make renewed overtures to its smaller rival in November. Pfizer has said it would lower its tax rate considerably by buying AstraZeneca and domiciling the combined company in the United Kingdom, a maneuver known as a tax inversion. Other healthcare companies are pursuing similar deals.Pfizer, in seeking mega-mergers in the past, has focused on big U.S. rivals, having bought Warner Lambert, Pharmacia and Wyeth since 2000. These deals provided huge cost cuts that have propped up its earnings.Lechleiter, in the television interview, said Lilly had not been approached by Pfizer and did not ""intend to be anyone's target."" But he said high U.S. corporate taxes put U.S. companies at a disadvantage. ""Companies doing inversions are simply trying to level the playing field,"" he added.Lilly said it had earned $734 million, or 68 cents per share, in the second quarter. That compared with $1.21 billion, or $1.11 per share, a year earlier, when the company took charges for closing a distribution center and other costs.Although revenue fell 17 percent to $4.94 billion, it topped Wall Street expectations of $4.90 billion.Lilly said it still expected earnings this year of $2.72 to $2.80 per share, excluding special items.Shares of Lilly were down 2 cents at $64.23 in early trading.

315,"   By Ben Hirschler | LONDON  LONDON AstraZeneca (AZN.L) has the chance next week to showcase its financial resilience after resisting a $118 billion takeover bid from Pfizer (PFE.N) - and, ironically, it will get a helping hand from its U.S. foe.Second-quarter results from the British drugmaker will be boosted by a $200 million milestone payment from Pfizer, following the U.S. company's launch of an over-the-counter version of AstraZeneca's heartburn medicine Nexium in May.AstraZeneca's Chief Executive Pascal Soriot will also be able to point to better results than initially expected due to a delay in generic versions of the prescription form of Nexium when he unveils results on July 31.A strong showing by AstraZeneca in the near term - both in  financial terms and in progress with its drug pipeline - is crucial for Soriot, who needs to pull out all the stops to prove that Pfizer's offer undervalued the firm.Many investors believe Pfizer will be back in late November after an enforced six-month cooling-off period - assuming AstraZeneca does not invite it back before then - because the logic of a deal remains strong. Pfizer would slash its tax bill by moving its tax address to Britain, in a process known as inversion. The case for such tax inversions remains compelling, as evidenced by AbbVie's (ABBV.N) successful pursuit of Shire (SHP.L). AstraZeneca earnings may be down from a year ago, however, reflecting ongoing competition from copycat forms of many other medicines, which will remain a drag on growth until about 2017. The $200 million Pfizer payment is expected to be booked as other income and included in core earnings per share (EPS), AstraZeneca's preferred measure of performance. The payment, triggered by the launch of OTC Nexium, is set to boost EPS by 12 cents, according to Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez, who rates the stock a market perform and forecasts core EPS of $1.13.It is not clear if all analysts have yet factored in this one-off windfall, with consensus forecasts pointing to a quarterly core EPS of $1.06, down from $1.20 a year ago. RANBAXY'S PAIN IS ASTRAZENECA'S GAIN AstraZeneca's sales for the quarter are forecast to be little changed from a year ago, at about $6.27 billion, as loss of exclusivity on some aging products is offset by the buyout of a previous diabetes joint venture with Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY.N).New diabetes drug Farxiga is expected to be a bright spot in the quarter, although sales of the older diabetes treatments Bydureon, Byetta and Onglyza are proving sluggish.Lung drug Symbicort is also performing well in the United States and has taken business from GlaxoSmithKline's (GSK.L) Advair, which is now flagging.  New heart drug Brilinta is expected to see some sales growth in the quarter, although Jefferies analysts said prescription data for the product showed no sign of a breakout from recent lackluster trends. Jefferies has AstraZeneca shares as a hold.AstraZeneca has a program of clinical trials underway involving more than 80,000 patients to try and expand the use of Brilinta, but it will take several years to deliver results.  A major bonus for Soriot and his team is the lack of any generic competition to prescription Nexium in the United States, despite the expiry of patent protection on the product which could have cleared the way for a launch at the end of May.India's Ranbaxy Laboratories (RANB.NS) holds the rights to sell the first generic copy of the popular prescription medicine but its continuing problems with meeting regulatory standards in manufacturing have delayed a launch. Nexium had global sales last year of $3.87 billion and U.S. sales of $2.12 billion.

316,"   By Ransdell Pierson | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Pfizer Inc's vulnerability to cheaper generics and its weak roster of experimental medicines will be on display Tuesday when the company reports quarterly earnings, reviving interest in its pursuit of AstraZeneca Plc or other deals to fortify its pipeline.The largest U.S. drugmaker, whose laboratories have not come up with any big-selling new medicines for a decade, is expected to report significantly lower second-quarter revenue.While many industry watchers expect Pfizer to re-engage with Britain's AstraZeneca in coming months, some say the U.S. drugmaker should consider targets more focused on biotechnology, a strategy that has paid off for Merck & Co and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. Although Pfizer is conducting trials of promising products - including breast cancer drug palbociclib and vaccines against meningitis and staph aureus - it needs far more drugs to generate meaningful sales growth, said Ori Hershkovitz, analyst with the Tel Aviv-based Sphera Fund, which holds Pfizer shares.    ""Pfizer is in a very desperate spot, having seen most of its pipeline disappoint and facing multiple patent expirations,"" he said. ""It needs growth; it needs to buy a pipeline."" Pfizer on May 26 officially abandoned its six-month quest for AstraZeneca after its final $118 billion offer was spurned. Investors still see a rationale for the deal, which would allow Pfizer to enjoy lower corporate tax rates as a UK-based company and a promising pipeline of new cancer treatments. Under British takeover law, AstraZeneca could reach out to Pfizer in August and Pfizer could make renewed overtures to its smaller rival in November.""I definitely think Pfizer will come back for Astra at a somewhat higher bid,"" Hershkovitz said. But he recommended Pfizer consider smaller targets whose treatments might broaden  its existing research priorities, such as Belgium's UCB SA and Switzerland's Actelion Ltd. UCB, which makes treatments for epilepsy, rheumatoid arthritis and Parkinson's disease, has annual sales of $5 billion, and a market value of $17 billion. Actelion sells lucrative drugs for orphan diseases, rare and often life-threatening conditions that command high prices. It has annual sales of $2 billion and a market capitalization of $15 billion.  Leerink Swann analyst Jason Gerberry has said it might make sense for Pfizer to buy Dublin-based generic drugmaker Actavis, which itself just bought U.S. specialty drugmaker Forest Laboratories for $25 billion.Disappointment with Pfizer is reflected in its stock price, which has fallen 1.4 percent this year, against a 11 percent gain for the ARCA Pharmaceutical Index of large U.S. and European drugmakers. Over the past two years, its shares have risen 27 percent, versus a 44 percent jump for the drug sector.A fresh wave of patent expirations on Pfizer's top drugs is approaching. Its Celebrex painkiller faces generics in the United States late this year, while impotence treatment Viagra goes generic in 2017. The company's biggest product, Lyrica for nerve pain, loses U.S. patent protection by 2018. The three drugs have combined annual sales of almost $9 billion, and account for almost 20 percent of Pfizer's total revenue.     Biotechs with drugs already on the market and which also  have exciting technologies should be on Pfizer's wish list, said Navid Malik, analyst with London-based Cenkos Securities. He cited companies such as Celgene Inc and Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc.Roger Pomerantz, who headed business development at Merck from 2010 until last summer, said the potential of Merck's immuno-oncology drugs - medicines which train the immune system to recognize cancer cells - was not recognized even within the company for several years after it acquired them.""It's who you have on the inside helping you understand the science"" that counts, he said.

317,"   By Ransdell Pierson  Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), which in May abandoned its $118 billion bid for AstraZeneca Plc (AZN.L), on Tuesday left investors guessing whether it would renew its pursuit of its British rival, but said it was considering other deals.The largest U.S. drugmaker reported higher-than-expected second-quarter revenue, helped by growing demand for its cancer medicines. But overall sales fell on competition with newer rival drugs and cheaper generics, trends that have quickened Pfizer’s efforts to buy companies and drugs that can fortify its medicine chest.Under UK takeover rules, AstraZeneca can attempt to re-engage with Pfizer in August, and Pfizer can make another run at AstraZeneca in November. Pfizer officials on Tuesday gave no hints of whether they would do so, although Chief Executive Ian Read said Pfizer is not currently ""doing any work on AstraZeneca"" because of a six-month quiet period imposed by U.K. regulators.""I think it's best to remain silent,"" Read said on an investor conference call, citing the takeover rules.Pfizer officially gave up its six-month quest to buy AstraZeneca after its final bid was rejected on May 26. It had hoped to locate the combined company in Britain, which has lower taxes than the United States, a maneuver called tax inversion. Read said Pfizer was also looking at other potential deals  and that taxes would be one of three major considerations.Other factors are whether a potential acquisition is undervalued, and whether cost savings from a deal would offset a premium price for shares of the target company.Read said Pfizer shareholders appreciated the company's limiting the final Astra offer to 55 pounds a share, rather than the minimum bid of 59 pounds that the British company had wanted. While 4 pounds might not seem a major chasm, Chief Financial Officer Frank D'Amelio quickly interjected in an interview, ""Every pound was $2 billion."" Pfizer shares have been flat this year due to declining revenue, while the drug sector as a whole has seen shares rise 11 percent.In the next four years, generic rivals will challenge well-known Pfizer products such as the Celebrex painkiller, Lyrica nerve pain treatment and anti-impotence drug Viagra, putting pressure on Pfizer to acquire new products.JP Morgan analyst Chris Schott speculated Pfizer may seek other tax-inversion opportunities if it is unable to reach a friendly deal with AstraZeneca. In the meantime, Pfizer is developing new drugs, including a promising treatment for breast cancer called Palbociclib that could be approved next year.Pfizer's research chief, Mikael Dolsten, said new uses for its Prevnar vaccine against pneumococcal bacteria and Xeljanz arthritis treatment could also bolster Pfizer. New vaccines against staph aureus and c. difficile bacteria could prove to be hidden gems in the Pfizer pipeline, he added.Pfizer earned $2.91 billion, or 45 cents per share, in the second quarter. That compared with $14.1 billion, or $1.98 per share, a year earlier, when it received more than $10 billion in proceeds from the spinoff of its animal health business, creating Zoetis (ZTS.N).

Nine of the 10 primary S&P 500 sectors fell on the day.United Parcel Service shares fell 3.7 percent to $98.86 after the world's biggest courier company slashed its earnings forecast for the year due to spending to boost capacity. It also reported second-quarter earnings that were below expectations. Rival shipping company FedEx Corp was down 1.6 percent at $147.14. The Dow Jones Transportation index, which is often viewed as a proxy for business activity, fell 1.4 percent. It is about 3 percent away from the record closing high hit last week.UPS is the latest bellwether name whose results have disappointed investors, following Amazon.com Inc and Boeing Co last week. Nonetheless, this earnings season has largely been a positive for equities.With more than half the S&P 500 having reported already, almost 70 percent have topped earnings expectations, according to Thomson Reuters data, well above the long-term average of 63 percent. More than 63 percent have topped revenue forecasts, above the long-term average of 61 percent.""If we started to see more negative outlooks, that would be a reason to pause, but so far this earnings season speaks to the health of corporate America and suggests markets still have room to run,"" said David Lebovitz, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Funds in New York. Telecom stocks were the only sector of the market to rise on Tuesday, adding 2.2 percent after Windstream Holdings  filed to spin off assets into a tax-efficient publicly traded real estate investment trust. The stock jumped 12.3 percent to $11.83 in its busiest trading day on record. Frontier Communications added 14.3 percent to $6.79.After the market closed, Twitter Inc jumped 14.5 percent to $44.20 in extended trading after the social networking company reported second-quarter results, which included revenue that more than doubled. The shares had closed up 1.7 percent in regular NYSE trade ahead of the results.Dow component American Express Co also reported after the market closed; its shares were little changed after the bell.The Dow Jones industrial average fell 70.16 points, or 0.41 percent, to 16,912.43, the S&P 500 lost 8.93 points, or 0.45 percent, to 1,969.98, and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 2.21 points, or 0.05 percent, to 4,442.70. The Nasdaq's decline was tempered by biotechnology shares, with the Nasdaq Biotech index up 1.1 percent.Dow components Pfizer and Merck, the No. 1 and No. 2 U.S. drug companies, respectively, reported better-than-expected results. Merck's new drugs offset declining sales of those facing generic competition. Pfizer was helped by growing sales of its cancer medicines. Merck rose 1.1 percent at $58.58 while Pfizer shed 1.2 percent to $29.73.Corning Inc dropped 9.3 percent to $20 after reporting earnings that came in below estimates as demand fell for its Gorilla Glass, which is used in iPhones and Galaxy devices.Economic data had little impact on the direction of equities.U.S. consumer confidence jumped in July to a high not seen since October 2007, but single-family home prices fell 0.3 percent in May on a seasonally adjusted basis, falling short of expectations.President Barack Obama said the United States was imposing new sanctions on Russia in the energy, arms and finance sectors, following similar moves by the European Union in reaction to Moscow's support for rebels in eastern Ukraine.About 57 percent of stocks traded on the New York Stock Exchange closed lower on the day while about 47 percent of Nasdaq-listed shares ended in negative territory. About 5.59 billion shares traded on all U.S. platforms, according to BATS exchange data, compared with the month-to-date average of 5.54 billion.

319,"  (Adds CEO, CFO, analyst comments, details on experimental drugs, paragraphs 4-15)By Ransdell PiersonJuly 29 Pfizer Inc, which in May abandoned its $118 billion bid for AstraZeneca Plc, on Tuesday left investors guessing whether it would renew its pursuit of its British rival, but said it was considering other deals.The largest U.S. drugmaker reported higher-than-expected second-quarter revenue, helped by growing demand for its cancer medicines. But overall sales fell on competition with newer rival drugs and cheaper generics, trends that have quickened Pfizer's efforts to buy companies and drugs that can fortify its medicine chest.Under UK takeover rules, AstraZeneca can attempt to re-engage with Pfizer in August, and Pfizer can make another run at AstraZeneca in November.Pfizer officials on Tuesday gave no hints of whether they would do so, although Chief Executive Ian Read said Pfizer is not currently ""doing any work on AstraZeneca"" because of a six-month quiet period imposed by U.K. regulators.""I think it's best to remain silent,"" Read said on an investor conference call, citing the takeover rules.Pfizer officially gave up its six-month quest to buy AstraZeneca after its final bid was rejected on May 26. It had hoped to locate the combined company in Britain, which has lower taxes than the United States, a maneuver called tax inversion.Read said Pfizer was also looking at other potential deals  and that taxes would be one of three major considerations.Other factors are whether a potential acquisition is undervalued, and whether cost savings from a deal would offset a premium price for shares of the target company. Read said Pfizer shareholders appreciated the company's limiting the final Astra offer to 55 pounds a share, rather than the minimum bid of 59 pounds that the British company had wanted.While 4 pounds might not seem a major chasm, Chief Financial Officer Frank D'Amelio quickly interjected in an interview, ""Every pound was $2 billion.""Pfizer shares have been flat this year due to declining revenue, while the drug sector as a whole has seen shares rise 11 percent.In the next four years, generic rivals will challenge well-known Pfizer products such as the Celebrex painkiller, Lyrica nerve pain treatment and anti-impotence drug Viagra, putting pressure on Pfizer to acquire new products. JP Morgan analyst Chris Schott speculated Pfizer may seek other tax-inversion opportunities if it is unable to reach a friendly deal with AstraZeneca.In the meantime, Pfizer is developing new drugs, including a promising treatment for breast cancer called Palbociclib that could be approved next year.Pfizer's research chief, Mikael Dolsten, said new uses for its Prevnar vaccine against pneumococcal bacteria and Xeljanz arthritis treatment could also bolster Pfizer. New vaccines against staph aureus and c. difficile bacteria could prove to be hidden gems in the Pfizer pipeline, he added. Pfizer earned $2.91 billion, or 45 cents per share, in the second quarter. That compared with $14.1 billion, or $1.98 per share, a year earlier, when it received more than $10 billion in proceeds from the spinoff of its animal health business, creating Zoetis.Excluding special items, Pfizer earned 58 cents per share. Analysts on average expected 57 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Sales fell 2 percent to $12.77 billion but exceeded Wall Street expectations of $12.46 billion.Sales of oncology medicines rose 16 percent to $570 million, but generic medicines that Pfizer calls established products and sells in emerging markets had lower sales.Pfizer stuck to its prior earnings forecast of $2.20 to $2.30 per share for the full year.Merck & Co, the second-biggest U.S. drugmaker, also reported higher-than-expected quarterly results on Tuesday.Pfizer shares closed down 1.2 percent to $29.73.

330,"   By Ben Hirschler | LONDON  LONDON AstraZeneca raised its sales and earnings forecasts for the year on Thursday, showing resilience after seeing off a $118 billion takeover approach from rival Pfizer two months ago.Second-quarter sales and earnings both beat expectations, helped by several one-off factors, including a product-related payment from Pfizer worth $200 million.Chief Executive Pascal Soriot has fought hard to demonstrate that AstraZeneca has a strong independent future and does not need the kind of mega-merger offered by its bigger U.S. rival,  despite the fact some investors favor a deal.He declined to comment on whether Pfizer might return but said he would flag AstraZeneca's progress as a standalone group at an investor day on Nov. 18 - just before a mandatory six-month cooling off period ends and Pfizer can renew its approach.Soriot has gained credit for his firm's pipeline of promising new cancer drugs, while the respiratory business has been boosted by strong demand for Symbicort, which has taken business from GlaxoSmithKline's rival drug Advair.AstraZeneca moved to boost its lung drug franchise further on Wednesday by acquiring rights to Spanish group Almirall's lung treatments in a deal worth up to $2.1 billion. Sales in the quarter rose 4 percent to $6.45 billion, despite generic competition to some drugs, generating core earnings - which exclude certain items - up 8 percent at $1.30 a share.Industry analysts, on average, had forecast sales in the quarter of $6.29 billion and earnings of $1.10 a share, according to Thomson Reuters data.“There is clearly visible momentum across our business as we continue to execute on our strategy of returning to growth and achieving scientific leadership,” Soriot told reporters. “We now have one of the most exciting pipelines in the industry.” He also said he hoped to strike partnering deals in the second half of 2014 for certain anti-infective and neuroscience drugs - including an experimental treatment for Alzheimer's - which will help reduce some of the firm's drug development costs.GENERIC NEXIUM DELAY Revenue in 2014 is now expected to be in line with 2013 at constant exchange rates - an increase on the previous forecast of a low to mid single-digit percentage decline - and core earnings per share are set for a low double-digit decline instead of a percentage decrease in the teens.Deutsche Bank analyst Mark Clark said the results represented a ""big beat"" but were flattered by one-time items and the improved outlook for the year was likely to be taken in its stride by the market. Shares in the company were little changed at 4,351 pence by 6:42 a.m. ET.A raft of patent expiries will pressure sales and profits until at least 2017 but Britain's second-biggest pharmaceuticals group is currently enjoying a partial reprieve, due to the delayed U.S. launch of a generic form of heartburn pill Nexium.

India's Ranbaxy Laboratories holds the rights to sell the first generic copy of the popular drug but its continuing problems with meeting regulatory standards in manufacturing have delayed a launch. AstraZeneca's quarterly results were also boosted by a $200 million milestone payment from Pfizer, following the U.S. company's launch of an over-the-counter version of Nexium in May, and a $80 million payment related to the Japanese launch of diabetes drug Forxiga.

335,"  LONDON Could Pfizer (PFE.N) acquire GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) as a ""plan B"" after failing to land AstraZeneca (AZN.L)? It would be a stretch but not totally impossible, according to analysts at Berenberg Bank.GSK’s market capitalization has slumped to $117 billion, or just under Pfizer’s failed offer for AstraZeneca, following weak quarterly results and a warning on full-year profits last week. [ID:nL6N0PY3FQ]Pfizer would have to offer a premium to that, but even if it paid $164 billion, or 20 pounds a share, with $74 billion in cash, it would still end up with a highly earnings-boosting deal, the bank said in a note on Friday.""This is perhaps a stretch, but not totally unrealistic,"" the analysts wrote.Pfizer, which has a market value of $183 billion, declined to be drawn this week on whether it would renew its bid for AstraZeneca later this year, as it is allowed to do, but said it was still considering big deals. [ID:nL2N0Q40JW] Buying a large British drug company is attractive to U.S.-based Pfizer because it would slash its tax bill by moving its tax address to Britain, in a process known as inversion.GSK and Pfizer already work together through the ViiV Healthcare joint venture in HIV/AIDS, which contains one of GSK's most promising new drugs, Tivicay.Acquiring GSK would also bolster Pfizer's vaccine business and give it a leading position in respiratory medicine, even if GSK is struggling with competition in this field. There would be further potential to combine the two firm's mature products. But there are also good reasons for Pfizer to think very hard before considering a move on GSK.The U.S. company is keen to grow in cancer, but GSK has just sold this part of its business to Novartis NOVN.VX, and it is instead bulking up in consumer healthcare, a area Pfizer quit some years back.  GSK, meanwhile, has said its complex three-way Novartis deal could create new options, and there has been speculation of a possible break-up of the company several years down the road.""GSK may just be too large for Pfizer to handle, but as a plan B it has some merits,"" Berenberg concluded.

336,"  (The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.)By John WasikCHICAGO Aug 4 For healthcare, gray is the new black.The fastest-growing segment of the global population is aged 60 and over, according to the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs. That slice of humanity is expected to increase by 45 percent by 2050.The surge in the older population has contributed to a wave of new product introductions in biotechnology, medical devices and pharmaceuticals, and expansion of healthcare services.In addition, healthcare is a remarkably durable sector for investors, soldiering on despite periodic market downturns, like the one seen last week when the S&P 500 index had its worst week since 2012.Overall, there's a bounty of money being spent on healthcare that's unlikely to be impacted by other economic trends.One of the best ways to own the biggest players in the healthcare industry is through the Vanguard Health Care ETF , which holds global giants like Johnson & Johnson , Pfizer Inc. and Merck and Co.. Charging 0.14 percent in annual management expenses, the Vanguard fund, which is almost entirely invested in U.S.-based stocks, gained 20 percent for the 12 months through Aug. 1, compared with 15 percent for the S&P 500 Total Return Index. Long-term, the Vanguard fund has been a solid performer, averaging 10.5 percent annually for the decade through Aug. 1. That compares with an average 7 percent return for the MSCI World NR stock index.For more non-U.S. exposure, consider the iShares Global Healthcare ETF, which charges 0.48 percent for annual expenses.The iShares fund has about 60 percent of its portfolio in North American stocks, with the remainder in European and Asian-based companies such as Novartis AG, Roche Holding AG and GlaxoSmithKline PLC. The fund gained 19 percent over the 12 months through Aug. 1. For a more focused play on leading-edge biotech and genomic companies, the First Trust NYSE Arca Biotech Index ETF  samples some of the hottest companies in that sub-sector. Holdings include industry leaders Gilead Sciences Inc., Biogen Idec Inc. and InterMune Inc..The First Trust fund was up nearly 25 percent for the 12 months through Aug. 1; it charges 0.60 percent in annual expenses.GOOD VALUATIONS AVAILABLE  Since most institutional portfolio managers have seen the merits of healthcare stocks for years, there are probably few bargains available, although some sectors are pricier than others. Biotech stocks, in particular, are in high demand, although they experienced a sell-off earlier this year.""On the other hand,"" Fidelity Investments analyst Eddie Yoon said in a recent report, ""some large-cap, stable growth companies across the (healthcare) sector continue to appear attractive, based on their stable underlying business fundamentals.""Unlike other sectors such as consumer discretionary that are directly tied to overall economic conditions, healthcare is often insulated from broader economic trends. When the S&P 500 index dropped 37 percent in 2008, the Vanguard fund only lost 23 percent; the First Trust fund was off 18 percent. While biotech stocks tend to be volatile, the mainstream healthcare companies are seen as defensive holdings and more immune to broader market pressures and poised for bankable growth.Long term, the more volatile biotech stocks of today may be tomorrow's winners. The growing science of genomics will allow biotech companies to customize drugs to a patient's genetic make-up. Just three years ago it cost $95 million to sequence a human genetic code. Now it costs about $4,000, with the price dropping every year. That will translate into more precise treatments with fewer side effects.There are several concurrent waves of innovation in health information technology, diagnostics and delivery of services. More patients can be monitored and treated at home with the improvement in information technology. Diseases are being discovered and treated earlier, which means fewer hospitalizations.In the United States alone, healthcare spending is buoyed by the $3 trillion spent annually on Medicare patients. While policymakers say this number is unsustainable and must be reined in, that does not change a key fact: Some 10,000 Baby Boomers are turning 65 every day. They will continue to demand the best drugs and treatments.

340,"  (Repeats for additional subscribers)By Jessica DyeAug 8 Pharmaceutical giant Pfizer is facing a mounting wave of lawsuits by women who allege that the company knew about possible serious side effects of its blockbuster anti-cholesterol drug Lipitor but never properly warned the public.In the past five months, a Reuters review of federal court filings shows, lawsuits by U.S. women who say that taking Lipitor gave them type-2 diabetes have shot up from 56 to almost 1,000.Lawsuits began to be filed not long after the Food and Drug Administration in 2012 warned that Lipitor and other statins had been linked to incidents of memory loss and a ""small increased risk"" of diabetes. According to plaintiffs' lawyers, women face a higher risk than men of developing diabetes from using Lipitor, and gain fewer benefits.The recent spike in lawsuits followed a decision by a federal judicial panel to consolidate all Lipitor diabetes lawsuits from around the country into a single Federal courtroom in Charleston, South Carolina. Pfizer opposed the consolidation, arguing it would prompt copycat filings. The first case is scheduled to be tried next July.Pfizer said in a statement that it denied liability and would fight the lawsuits.It is not uncommon for a drugmaker to get hit with thousands of lawsuits over its products after the FDA orders a label change alerting users to newly found risks. Takeda Pharmaceutical, for instance, is facing more than 3,500 federal lawsuits since 2011 when the FDA ordered it to update the label on its diabetes drug Actos to warn about bladder cancer. Takeda has denied liability.But several factors set the Lipitor diabetes cases apart from those against other drug companies. For one, Lipitor is the best-selling prescription drug of all time, racking up global sales of more than $130 billion since it went on the market in 1996. More than 29 million patients in the United States have been prescribed the drug, suggesting there is a vast pool of potential plaintiffs.On the other hand, potentially complicating matters for plaintiffs, the FDA emphasized the benefits of statins even as it warned of the risks. When the labeling change was released in 2012, a top FDA official underscored that the agency still stood behind the drugs: ""Clearly, we think that the heart benefit of statins outweighs this small increased risk (for diabetes),"" Amy Egan, a deputy director for safety at the agency's Division of Metabolism and Endocrinology, said in a statement at the time.Statins are a class of drugs that block the liver's production of cholesterol to reduce the risk of heart disease. Type 2 diabetes, once known as adult-onset or noninsulin-dependent diabetes, is a chronic condition that affects the way the body metabolizes glucose.RISKS AND BENEFITS The seemingly mixed message from the FDA suggests that litigation will focus on two questions: how big a diabetes risk do women using Lipitor face, and whether that risk is mitigated by the drug's cardiovascular benefits. H. Blair Hahn of Mount Pleasant, South Carolina, the lead lawyer appointed to represent Lipitor plaintiffs in federal court, said the plaintiffs contracted diabetes as a consequence of taking Lipitor, and that women with diabetes see the length and quality of their lives reduced.""We will ask a jury to decide what it's worth to take five years of someone's life,"" Hahn said. He said the nearly 1,000 cases filed so far represent 4,000 women, and that the number of cases could ultimately reach 10,000 or more.Pfizer said it believes Lipitor did not cause the plaintiffs' diabetes. Women who are prescribed Lipitor to control cholesterol may share other risk factors that make them vulnerable to the disease, such as high blood pressure or obesity, the company said.The Pfizer statement said there is an ""overwhelming consensus"" in the medical community about statins' benefits. BELLWETHER TRIALS The first Lipitor trial, scheduled for next July before U.S. District Judge Richard Gergel, will be one of several so-called ""bellwethers"" used to gauge the strength of other cases.

341,"   By Jessica Dye  Pharmaceutical giant Pfizer is facing a mounting wave of lawsuits by women who allege that the company knew about possible serious side effects of its blockbuster anti-cholesterol drug Lipitor but never properly warned the public.In the past five months, a Reuters review of federal court filings shows, lawsuits by U.S. women who say that taking Lipitor gave them type-2 diabetes have shot up from 56 to almost 1,000. Lawsuits began to be filed not long after the Food and Drug Administration in 2012 warned that Lipitor and other statins had been linked to incidents of memory loss and a ""small increased risk"" of diabetes. According to plaintiffs' lawyers, women face a higher risk than men of developing diabetes from using Lipitor, and gain fewer benefits. The recent spike in lawsuits followed a decision by a federal judicial panel to consolidate all Lipitor diabetes lawsuits from around the country into a single Federal courtroom in Charleston, South Carolina. Pfizer opposed the consolidation, arguing it would prompt copycat filings. The first case is scheduled to be tried next July.Pfizer said in a statement that it denied liability and would fight the lawsuits. It is not uncommon for a drugmaker to get hit with thousands of lawsuits over its products after the FDA orders a label change alerting users to newly found risks. Takeda Pharmaceutical, for instance, is facing more than 3,500 federal lawsuits since 2011 when the FDA ordered it to update the label on its diabetes drug Actos to warn about bladder cancer. Takeda has denied liability.But several factors set the Lipitor diabetes cases apart from those against other drug companies. For one, Lipitor is the best-selling prescription drug of all time, racking up global sales of more than $130 billion since it went on the market in 1996. More than 29 million patients in the United States have been prescribed the drug, suggesting there is a vast pool of potential plaintiffs. On the other hand, potentially complicating matters for plaintiffs, the FDA emphasized the benefits of statins even as it warned of the risks. When the labeling change was released in 2012, a top FDA official underscored that the agency still stood behind the drugs: ""Clearly, we think that the heart benefit of statins outweighs this small increased risk (for diabetes),"" Amy Egan, a deputy director for safety at the agency's Division of Metabolism and Endocrinology, said in a statement at the time.Statins are a class of drugs that block the liver's production of cholesterol to reduce the risk of heart disease. Type 2 diabetes, once known as adult-onset or noninsulin-dependent diabetes, is a chronic condition that affects the way the body metabolizes glucose. RISKS AND BENEFITS The seemingly mixed message from the FDA suggests that litigation will focus on two questions: how big a diabetes risk do women using Lipitor face, and whether that risk is mitigated by the drug's cardiovascular benefits.H. Blair Hahn of Mount Pleasant, South Carolina, the lead lawyer appointed to represent Lipitor plaintiffs in federal court, said the plaintiffs contracted diabetes as a consequence of taking Lipitor, and that women with diabetes see the length and quality of their lives reduced. ""We will ask a jury to decide what it's worth to take five years of someone's life,"" Hahn said. He said the nearly 1,000 cases filed so far represent 4,000 women, and that the number of cases could ultimately reach 10,000 or more.     Pfizer said it believes Lipitor did not cause the plaintiffs' diabetes. Women who are prescribed Lipitor to control cholesterol may share other risk factors that make them vulnerable to the disease, such as high blood pressure or obesity, the company said.The Pfizer statement said there is an ""overwhelming consensus"" in the medical community about statins' benefits. BELLWETHER TRIALS The first Lipitor trial, scheduled for next July before U.S. District Judge Richard Gergel, will be one of several so-called ""bellwethers"" used to gauge the strength of other cases.

345,"  Aug 13 An influential U.S. medical advisory panel on Wednesday recommended that people 65 and older be given Pfizer Inc's blockbuster Prevnar 13 vaccine to protect against pneumococcal bacteria that can cause pneumonia and other infections.The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), in a 13-2 vote, recommended that elderly patients take Pfizer's vaccine, even if they had previously been vaccinated with Merck & Co's leading Pneumovax vaccine. But the panel, which provides medical advice to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, expressed concern that the federal Medicare insurance program for the elderly currently is unable to cover Prevnar 13 for patients who have already taken Pneumovax.  A Medicare official, speaking to the panel in Atlanta, said his agency would have to change its rules in order to qualify such patients for reimbursement, and that its evaluation would likely stretch out until January 2016.

346,"  (Adds sales forecast, more details)LONDON Aug 13 AstraZeneca, which fended off a $118 billion takeover approach from Pfizer in May, reported positive results for an experimental gout drug on Wednesday that could boost its sales modestly.The drug, lesinurad, is not forecast by analysts to be a major seller but its success in three late-stage clinical trials is a vindication of AstraZeneca's ability to develop new medicines and comes after recent progress in cancer treatments. The three Phase III studies all showed the potential of lesinurad, a selective uric acid re-absorption inhibitor, for use in combination with existing medicines as a treatment for gout - a painful joint condition caused by the build-up of uric acid in the blood.However, the drug did also cause more side effects, especially at higher doses, than seen with the older drugs used on their own. The company said detailed results would be submitted to a scientific meeting later this year, and it would prepare a regulatory submission for a 200 mg dose of the drug in combination therapy. Industry analysts forecast annual sales of lesinurad to reach $281 million by 2019, according to consensus forecasts compiled by Thomson Reuters Pharma.AstraZeneca acquired lesinurad after buying U.S. company Ardea Biosciences for $1.26 billion two years ago.

347,"  Bristol-Myers Squibb Co and Pfizer Inc on Thursday said U.S. regulators have approved an expanded use for their Eliquis blood clot preventer, to treat blood clots in the legs and lungs.The drugmakers said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration also approved use of the pill to reduce risk of recurrent blood clots in the deep veins of the leg, called deep vein thrombosis, and in the lung, called pulmonary embolism, following initial therapy.Leg clots, if untreated, can travel to the heart, lungs and brain, and cause heart attacks and stroke. Lung clots, which can choke off blood flow, are linked to high mortality rates and require immediate treatment. Eliquis, which works by blocking a protein called Factor Xa that is involved in the clotting process, is already approved to prevent strokes in patients who have an irregular heartbeat called atrial fibrillation. It is meant to be an alternative to warfarin, an older oral drug that can cause serious bleeding episodes and comes with strict dietary restrictions and the need for frequent blood checks.  In large clinical trials involving patients with leg and lung clots, Eliquis was shown to cause far fewer cases of major bleeding than standard treatment with blood clot preventer enoxaparin for five days, overlapped by treatment with warfarin. Eliquis was shown to be similarly effective as standard care.Bristol-Myers and Pfizer are hoping the new approved use for Eliquis will significantly boost demand for Eliquis, whose sales have been very disappointing since it was introduced in late 2012. It garnered $171 million in sales in the second quarter. That pales with blockbuster sales of a similar drug from Johnson & Johnson called Xarelto, and a different but new type of blood clot preventer called Pradaxa, sold by privately held German drugmaker Boehringer Ingelheim.

350,"   By Ben Hirschler | LONDON  LONDON Shares in drugmaker AstraZeneca have climbed more than 7 percent this week, fueled by speculation of renewed takeover interest from Pfizer, following an abortive $118 billion (71 billion pounds) takeover attempt in May.But while British takeover rules mean deal talks could be back on the cards as early as Aug. 26, following the ending of the first of a two-stage cooling-off period, many investors and analysts see the year-end as a more likely time for any return.""I'm not expecting anything next week,"" said Dan Mahony, a fund manager at Polar Capital, who increased his stake in AstraZeneca last year. ""I know the stock is rallying on anticipation but I suspect if anything is going to happen it is more likely to happen in November or December.""Pfizer Chief Executive Ian Read has made clear he is still considering big deals to revive his firm's pipeline and cut its tax bill - something buying AstraZeneca would allow it to do via a so-called inversion that would shift its tax base to Britain.However, Read has little leverage right now. Pfizer cannot take the initiative and launch a public bid until Nov. 26 - six months from when it walked away after AstraZeneca rejected its last offer - though AstraZeneca can invite it back from Aug. 26.British rules also allow Pfizer to make a single offer via a private phone call to AstraZeneca. But this single offer option is rarely used in takeover situations as the bidder has no way to take things further if the target simply says ""no"".As a result, Pfizer would need to make a knockout offer at a big premium to its last bid of 55 pounds a share, which many analysts view as unlikely given Read's reluctance to close the gap in May to the 58.85 pounds AstraZeneca indicated it wanted. CANCER DRUG HOPES The one factor that could force AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot back to the table this month would be sustained pressure from his shareholders, a number of whom are disgruntled that he let Pfizer's offer slip away. Yet there has been no high-profile investor rebellion so far - and Soriot has been steadily building up hopes for his company's new cancer drugs, adding respiratory medicines through a deal with Almirall and putting behind him a damaging U.S. investigation into heart drug Brilinta.AstraZeneca aims to present more convincing evidence for its experimental medicines at a cancer conference in Madrid in late September, and Soriot intends to highlight the potential of the full line-up of new drugs at an investor day on Nov. 18.The decision to time that investor event just one week before Pfizer has a free hand to renew its approaches suggests AstraZeneca is ""very unlikely"" to invite Pfizer to make a new offer once the three-month cooling off period ends next week, according to analysts at Jefferies.Political uncertainty has also played into the British group's hands to some extent, with recent U.S. threats to clamp down on tax inversions provoking fears that such tax-saving deals may in future be blocked.  Following the failure to buy AstraZeneca in May, healthcare bankers says Pfizer has been looking at other targets.Ireland-based Actavis would represent one good alternative, according to analysts at Leerink, and Berenberg believes Pfizer could even contemplate buying AstraZeneca's larger British rival GlaxoSmithKline.But neither offers as good a fit as AstraZeneca, whose pipeline of immune system-boosting cancer drugs would complement Pfizer's currently narrow oncology portfolio.AstraZeneca shares were 2.2 percent high at 43.79 pounds by 1.50 p.m. BST, outperforming a 0.6 percent gain in the European drugs sector.

351,"  * Deal boosts Roche's presence in respiratory medicine* $74 per share cash offer represents 38 pct premium* Roche sees transaction neutral for core EPS in 2015* Consensus 2019 sales for InterMune lung drug $1.04 bln   (Adds comments from Roche CEO, analyst)By Ben Hirschler and Caroline CopleyLONDON/ZURICH, Aug 24 Roche Holding AG  has agreed to buy U.S. biotech company InterMune Inc  for $8.3 billion in cash, marking the latest multibillion-dollar deal in a consolidating pharmaceutical sector.The Swiss drugmaker said on Sunday it would pay $74.00 a share through a tender offer for InterMune, representing a premium of 38 percent to the closing price on Aug. 22.The acquisition, which has been recommended by the boards of both companies, is the largest by Roche since 2009, when it bought out the remaining stake it did not already own in U.S. group Genentech for around $47 billion.Chief Executive Severin Schwan said the deal would allow Roche to broaden and strengthen its respiratory portfolio, adding he believed there was a good strategic and cultural fit between Roche and the California-based biotech firm.""For us at Roche, this transaction is a good example of a value-creating bolt-on acquisition; we focus on targeted acquisitions that really compliment our portfolio (...) rather than trying to diversify or going into mega mergers,"" he told reporters on a conference call.The sale of InterMune will not surprise investors hugely as people familiar with the matter said on Aug. 13 InterMune was working with financial advisers to evaluate strategic options, due to takeover interest from big drugmakers.Shares in the InterMune rose sharply on that news, so the $74 offered by Roche marks a 63 percent premium to the stock's level on Aug. 12. Such a hefty premium is not unusual in biotech takeovers, reflecting intense competition for promising new drugs among larger companies, which rely on small innovative firms for a growing proportion of their products.Adding InterMune to its portfolio will give Roche a promising new drug, pirfenidone, for treating a progressive and ultimately fatal scarring condition of the lungs. Pirfenidone is approved for so-called idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) in Europe and Canada, and is undergoing U.S. regulatory review.Industry analysts expect the drug, which is given as a pill, to have sales of $1.04 billion in 2019, according to consensus forecasts compiled by Thomson Reuters Pharma.The deal is a further step by Roche to diversify away from its reliance on cancer drugs, where it is the world leader, by expanding into other disease areas, such as respiratory medicine.Roche already markets Pulmozyme for cystic fibrosis and Xolair for severe asthma in the United States and has other experimental respiratory products in clinical development, including another severe asthma drug called lebrikizumab. However, the Swiss group's efforts to produce successful non-cancer drugs from its own labs have been mixed, with setbacks in recent years for experimental drugs against heart disease, diabetes and schizophrenia.""BOLT-ON"" ACQUISITION Although it is paying a big price for InterMune, the deal is seen inside Roche as a ""bolt-on"" acquisition, given the company's own market value of around $250 billion.Roche said the transaction was expected to be neutral for its core earnings per share in 2015 but would boost profits from 2016 onwards. It said guidance for this year remained unchanged.The Swiss company generates a large amount of cash, leading to persistent speculation about deals. In practice, its track record since Genentech has been for a series of small-scale purchases. It notably backed away from a $7 billion pursuit of gene sequencing firm Illumina Inc two years ago. Recently, there has been talk that Roche might buy the shares in Japan's Chugai Pharmaceutical Co Ltd that it does not already own for about $10 billion, although Chugai has denied it was in talks for a such a deal.Schwan declined to comment on whether the InterMune deal would make a buyout of Chugai less likely. He said Roche would continue to pursue targeted ""bolt-on"" acquisitions.Even after swallowing InterMune, Roche would still have the leverage to ""very easily"" buy out the rest of Chugai and do something else, said Kepler Cheuvreux analyst Fabian Wenner. But he conceded such a move may now be ""somewhat less likely"".InterMune had considered selling itself about three years ago but decided not to pursue a deal at that time due to uncertainty over clinical data for pirfenidone, people familiar with the matter told Reuters previously.Roche said its interest in a deal was triggered following positive late-stage trial results for the drug in May. The medicine also received a ""breakthrough therapy"" designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The term is reserved for drugs for serious diseases that appear to offer a substantial advance on existing therapies.The FDA is due to give is verdict on whether to approve pirfenidone by Nov. 23 and Roche said it expected the launch the drug in the United States this year.Healthcare companies are merging at a record pace, with year-to-date activity topping $346 billion, compared to $212 billion in the year-ago period, Thomson Reuters data showed.Recent large deals have included AbbVie Inc's $54 billion acquisition of Shire Plc and Medtronic Inc's  acquisition of Covidien Plc for $43 billion. AstraZeneca Plc, meanwhile, fended off a $118 billion takeover attempt by Pfizer Inc.Under the terms of the InterMune agreement, Roche will commence a tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares in the U.S. firm no later than Aug. 29.Citi is acting as financial adviser to Roche, while Centerview Partners and Goldman Sachs are acting for InterMune.

352,"   By Ransdell Pierson  Pfizer Inc said Tuesday it will test its Xalkori lung cancer drug with Merck & Co's experimental immunotherapy pembrolizumab, in hopes the combination will improve the outcomes for patients taking the approved Pfizer therapy.The largest U.S. drugmakers said the combination study will begin in 2015 and be conducted by Pfizer. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.Xalkori, which has annual sales of $400 million and is also known by its chemical name, crizotinib, was approved in 2011 for lung cancer patients who have a specific mutation in the so-called ALK gene, as determined by an approved diagnostic test.The mutation occurs in a small percentage of patients with non small cell lung cancer, the most common form of lung cancer. It makes them good candidates for treatment with Xalkori, a targeted drug that can help shrink or slow tumor growth for these patients.    Pembrolizumab works by removing the brakes from the immune system, allowing it to detect and destroy cancer cells. The differing mechanisms of action from combination therapy are meant to deliver a one-two punch to cancer cells.The Merck drug, called a PD-1 inhibitor, is expected to be approved within months in the United States and to become a blockbuster treatment for melanoma, and possibly later for lung cancer and other types of cancer, depending on results of ongoing clinical trials. Merck, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Swiss drugmaker Roche and AstraZeneca Plc are leading the charge in developing PD-1 inhibitors or similar immunotherapies. Some industry analysts believe the medicines will capture combined annual sales of up to $30 billion by 2025. Merck and Pfizer previously said they would collaborate in combination trials of pembrolizumab both with Pfizer's approved Inlyta (axitinib) treatment for kidney cancer, and with an experimental drug called PF-2566 that Pfizer is evaluating in numerous cancer types. PF-2566 stimulates activity of 4-1BB (CD-137), a protein involved in regulation of immune cell proliferation. ""For Pfizer, these collaborations help secure their drugs in a market that is going under a paradigm shift"" toward immunotherapies, said Morningstar analyst Damien Conover. ""I see it more of a defensive move to make sure Pfizer's drugs are being used in the anti-PD-1 space, instead of being bypassed.""Merck is not studying pembrolizumab in combination with its own experimental drugs, but has other combination studies planned or underway with a growing number of drugmakers, including Amgen.

357,"  FRANKFURT Germany's Bayer unveiled plans to launch three new studies to expand the uses of its anti-clotting drug Xarelto, one of its top five new medicines.Xarelto, which competes with the Eliquis pill developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer in stroke prevention, reached sales of $1.7 billion in the 12 months to June. Analysts estimate annual sales could rise to more than $9.5 billion by 2020.The drug, jointly developed with U.S. firm Johnson & Johnson, is currently approved for uses including the prevention of strokes caused by atrial fibrillation, a type of arrhythmia.Bayer said on Friday that a Phase III trial involving about 7,000 patients would examine whether Xarelto can help prevent the recurrence of strokes in patients who have suffered strokes of undetermined cause.""We really have just as many strokes due to undetermined causes as to atrial fibrillation,"" Frank Misselwitz, head of the Therapeutic Area Cardiovascular and Coagulation at Bayer HealthCare, told Reuters. A second Phase III trial announced on Friday will examine the potential benefits of Xarelto in reducing thrombotic vascular complications in more than 5,000 patients with peripheral artery disease.The third new study is a Phase II trial designed to evaluate Xarelto for long-term prevention of acute coronary syndrome in patients who have suffered from the illness. If the study involving between 2,000 and 3,000 patients is successful, a Phase III study will follow, Bayer said.Misselwitz declined to say whether expanding the uses of Xarelto would prompt Bayer to raise its estimate of the drug's peak sales potential, which Chief Executive Marijn Dekkers has so far put at about 3.5 billion euros a year. ""But these are major illnesses,"" Misselwitz said with reference to the planned trials. Bayer shares were flat at 1441 GMT, against a 0.8 percent lower Dax index. Xarelto is also currently used to treat and prevent deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolisms and to reduce the risk of strokes and blood clots in patients with an irregular heart beat that is not caused by heart problems.

360,"  * Phase II study to assess MEDI-4736 in colorectal cancer* Move may open large new market for experimental drug* Company's cancer drugs part of attraction for Pfizer* AstraZeneca shares up 2 percent   (Adds sales forecasts, detail on competitors, latest shares)By Ben HirschlerLONDON, Aug 29 Hopes for AstraZeneca's  promising cancer drug pipeline were boosted on Friday by news the company had moved its immuno-oncology medicine MEDI-4736 into a mid-stage study in colorectal cancer.The drug, which is designed to help the immune system fight tumours, will be tested in 48 patients with advanced disease in the Phase II trial, according to an update on the website clinicaltrials.gov (here)Analysts at UBS said the decision opened up ""a potentially multi-blockbuster opportunity"", given that colorectal cancer is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States.AstraZeneca is already studying MEDI-4736 in lung cancer and head and neck cancer. Head of medicines development Briggs Morrison said in July that it might start tests in another tumour type in 2014 but he did not identify colorectal cancer as a target at the time. Shares in AstraZeneca, which also remain propped up by speculation of a possible renewed bid from Pfizer, rose 2.1 percent to 45.74 pounds by 1000 GMT, outperforming a 0.4 percent gain in the European drugs sector.Although British-based AstraZeneca fended off a $118 billion takeover attempt by Pfizer in May, the U.S. drugmaker could still decide to return to the fray.Pfizer Chief Executive Ian Read has made clear he is still considering big deals to revive his firm's pipeline and cut its tax bill - something buying AstraZeneca would allow it to do via a so-called inversion that would shift its tax base to Britain.Recently, speculation has grown that Read might look at other targets, such as Ireland-based Actavis. But Actavis, which is a major seller of generic drugs, would not be as good a fit strategically as AstraZeneca.AstraZeneca's pipeline of immune system-boosting cancer drugs would complement Pfizer's currently narrow oncology portfolio - and progress with MEDI-4736 might make it a more attractive target. MEDI-4736 is part of a closely-watched class of drugs known as anti-PD-L1 therapies, which block a tumour's ability to evade the immune system's defences.$6.5 BILLION SALES? MEDI-4736 is seen as AstraZeneca's most important new drug hope and it was one of several experimental products flagged by the company in May in a bid to convince investors the group has a healthy future as an independent company. Overall, the British company forecasts its new products will help its sales rise 75 percent to $45 billion by 2023 - a number viewed as optimistic by many analysts. Within this, it forecast potential peak sales for MEDI-4736 of $6.5 billion, including use in combination therapies.UBS, which rates AstraZeneca a ""buy"", said it currently expected MEDI-4736 could generate peak sales in solid tumours of $1 billion but success in colorectal cancer would likely make this estimate highly conservative.""If this peak sales figure is raised to $5 billion, for example, then the NPV (net present value) upside could be around 5 pounds per share, without risk-adjustment,"" it said.The new open-label Phase II study, which is not yet open for patient recruitment, is being run by the New York-based Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in collaboration with AstraZeneca.AstraZeneca is seen as No. 4 in a race to develop the first drug in a new immuno-oncology class, behind rivals Merck & Co , Roche and Bristol-Myers Squibb, but it still has the capacity to steal a march in certain areas.Its rivals have yet to initiate dedicated studies in colorectal cancer, although the disease is being explored by competitors as part of studies looking at multiple tumours.AstraZeneca is due to present more data on MEDI-4736 in lung cancer and head and neck cancer at an oncology conference in Madrid at the end of September.In recent years, the British drugmaker has become best known for its cholesterol drug Crestor and its ulcer and heartburn pill Nexium. But it has a long history in oncology, having broken new ground decades ago in developing tamoxifen and other hormonal therapies.

361,"  * FTSE 100 up 0.1 percent* Tesco slashes profit forecast and dividend* Supermarket groups trade sharply lower* Astra buoyed by speculation of new Pfizer bidBy Tricia WrightLONDON, Aug 29 British shares inched higher on Friday in cautious trade as investors awaited inflation figures for the euro zone which may shed light on the European Central Bank's next move, though shares in Tesco dropped sharply on the back of a profit warning.Tesco slumped 6.2 percent after it cut its profit forecast for the second time in two months and slashed its interim dividend by 75 percent as tough operating conditions continued to ravage its business.Tesco, which had issued a profit warning in July as it announced the departure of its chief executive Phil Clarke, also said its new head Dave Lewis would start work on Monday, a month earlier than expected, and launch a full review of the company. ""They were pretty awful figures,"" Joe Rundle, head of trading at ETX Capital, said.""I think that probably the market will give them a little bit of a break because of the new CEO coming in, starting a month early, so at least they're trying to be proactive, but I think the worrying sign is they're cutting their dividend and a lot of people are in it for the dividend.""Rundle saw scope for the shares, which have been languishing at 10-year lows, to trend towards 200 pence - some 13 percent below current levels. The Tesco profit warning took its toll on sector peers, with Sainsbury and Morrisons both down 3.5 percent.Despite these sharp falls, the FTSE 100 managed to make headway, up 7.49 points, or 0.1 percent, at 6,813.29 points by 0816 GMT, partly thanks to gains from AstraZeneca.Shares in the drugmaker rose 2.2 percent, fuelled once again by talk of renewed takeover interest from Pfizer, following an abortive $118 billion takeover attempt in May.The same speculation has triggered a more than 11 percent rise in the shares over the last two weeks. ""(There is) a plethora of business taking place this morning (in Astra's shares), which I attribute to traders not wanting to be positioned short over the weekend should something be announced when the markets are closed,"" ayondo markets' senior trader Jordan Hiscott said.Also proving supportive, hopes for AstraZeneca's promising cancer drug pipeline were boosted on Friday by news the company had moved its immuno-oncology medicine MEDI-4736 into a mid-stage study in colorectal cancer.Euro zone inflation, due at 0900 GMT, is seen dropping to 0.3 percent in August, following a surprise dip to 0.4 percent in July, according to a Reuters poll of analysts.The data will be at the centre of the ECB's policy meeting next week, driving the debate about whether the central bank should accelerate existing policy measures to fight the risk of deflation.The FTSE has risen around 4 percent in the past 2-1/2 weeks, helped by expectations of ECB stimulus. The index had climbed to 6,894.88 points in mid-May, its highest level in more than 14 years. But it has not passed 6,900, considered a key hurdle before the FTSE can challenge record highs around 7,000.""It (ECB stimulus) is priced in to a large degree, but because interest rates are so low equities remain the asset class of choice to achieve yield,"" Lex van Dam, a hedge fund manager at Hampstead Capital, said.

362,"  * Good news for new PCSK9 drug class but needs confirmation* Sanofi, Regeneron vying with drugs from Amgen and Pfizer* Data from four alirocumab studies unveiled at ESC congressBy Ben HirschlerBARCELONA, Aug 31 An experimental cholesterol-lowering drug from Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals roughly halved the number of heart attacks and strokes in a clinical trial, researchers reported on Sunday.The result is not conclusive, because the analysis was done retrospectively, but it provides the first evidence that targeting a protein known as PCSK9 could slash cardiovascular risks for millions of patients.The injectable drug, alirocumab, is from a new class of medicines, which are also being developed by Amgen and Pfizer. They lower ""bad"" LDL cholesterol in a new way and are widely expected to reap multibillion-dollar sales.The finding is likely to spur enthusiasm about the drugs, which could reach the market next year, although experts said it still needed to be confirmed in a much larger trial.Sanofi and Regeneron said in July that nine big studies showed consistent LDL reductions with alirocumab, but details from four of these trials have only now been unveiled at the European Society of Cardiology annual meeting in Barcelona.The encouraging cardiovascular data come from an interim safety analysis of one of these studies showing patients on alirocumab were less prone to a combination of cardiovascular events, including cardiac death, heart attack, stroke and chest pain requiring hospitalisation.Both groups of patients got traditional anti-cholesterol statin pills in addition to alirocumab or a placebo. Among the alirocumab group, 1.4 percent of patients suffered a major cardiovascular event against 3.0 percent of those on placebo. The ongoing 2,341-patient study, called Odyssey Long Term, is expected to conclude early next year but researchers said the early sign of efficacy was clearly positive.""To have this result emerge so quickly in this study is very encouraging,"" said Jennifer Robinson, a cardiologist at the University of Iowa, who led the study.No other drugmaker has previously released data suggesting reduced cardiovascular risk from PCSK9 inhibitors.Patrick O'Gara of the Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston and president of the American College of Cardiology said the finding was ""biologically plausible"" but the post-hoc or retrospective nature of the analysis necessitated caution.""It's so much wished-for that we must be careful,"" he said. WATCHING SIDE EFFECTS Sanofi and Regeneron are in a fierce race with Amgen, which last week became the first company to file with regulators to sell its product evolocumab.The French and U.S. partners hope to close the gap after paying $67.5 million last month for a voucher from BioMarin Pharmaceutical designed to assure alirocumab an expedited U.S. regulatory review.It is unclear if the rival PCSK9 drugs will prove to be very different from each other but Sanofi's research head Elias Zerhouni thinks alirocumab should enjoy an early advantage from the preliminary indication of improved cardiovascular results. That may help convince cost-conscious healthcare providers to pay up for an expensive new medicine before results from the large 18,000-patient trial are available in 2017 or 2018.""It has to be confirmed by the big outcomes study but it is the first scientific indication that there is something other than a statin that potentially shows you can get a reduction in risk,"" Zerhouni told Reuters.All four trials presented in Barcelona showed alirocumab cut LDL by around 50-60 percent after 24 weeks. Side effects included stuffy nose and upper respiratory tract infections.Doctors and regulatory authorities are watching closely to see if cutting LDL so sharply may have an adverse effect on other parts of the body, notably the brain.So far, there is no sign of this. There was a small non-statistically significant trend towards more neurocognitive problems in Odyssey Long Term but the other three studies showed alirocumab patients had fewer such issues.PCSK9 drugs will be targeted first at people with a rare familial condition that raises their cholesterol dangerously, as well as statin-intolerant patients and those at high-risk of a heart attack who struggle to control LDL on current medicines.Sanofi and Regeneron estimate this high-risk group totals around 21 million patients in the United States and Europe.Whether the drugs, which will be offered in pre-filled syringes and auto-injector pens, will be used more generally depends on how their cost-effective they are deemed to be.The companies say it is premature to talk about price but it is clear the antibody-based therapies will not be cheap, with Barclays analysts suggesting $6,000 a year as a possible price in the United States, with a lower price likely in Europe.

365,"   By P.J. Huffstutter and Tom Polansek | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Zoetis Inc has received a conditional license from the U.S. Department of Agriculture for its vaccine against a deadly piglet virus and will begin selling it this month in the United States, the company said on Wednesday.Shares of Zoetis, the world's largest animal-health company, reached an all-time high of $36.65 and were up 0.7 percent at $35.73 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.With its new vaccine, Zoetis joins a growing push by both the agriculture and pharmaceutical industries to combat the spread of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDv), which has killed about 13 percent of the U.S. hog herd over the past year.Results from preliminary studies on the product have been ""promising,"" said Joelle Hayden, spokeswoman for USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.""They’ve shown sufficient data that we think the vaccine will be effective,"" she said about Zoetis. The vaccine comes as veterinarians warn that outbreaks of the virus are expected to surge this fall and winter because PEDv thrives in cold weather.Zoetis' product means that hog farmers now have two PEDv vaccine options. Earlier this year, USDA granted a similar conditional approval to Iowa-based Harrisvaccines for its PEDv vaccine.Merck & Co. Inc's animal health unit is also working on a PEDv vaccine. Zoetis was spun off from drugmaker Pfizer Inc last year.   The fast-moving virus has killed an estimated 8 million piglets since it was first identified in the United States last year, pushing U.S. pork prices to record highs.The conditional license will allow Zoetis to sell the two-dose inactivated vaccine directly to veterinarians and hog farmers alike, for use on healthy pregnant sows, while the company continues to conduct further tests both in research laboratories and in field tests at customers' farms.Zoetis declined to comment on the company's research, how successful the vaccine has been in reducing mortality rates in baby pigs or what field tests have shown so far. Company officials did not say how much the vaccine will cost. ""We have proven at least some efficacy of those antibodies produced with the sow of being transferred to the baby piglets,"" Gloria Basse, vice president of the company's U.S. pork marketing, said in an interview.Zoetis said it was exploring new international markets, including Canada, Mexico and Japan, for the vaccine. Concerns over the virus have fueled contamination fears among U.S. trading partners and prompted a four-month ban on imports of live U.S. pigs into China. ""Really anywhere there’s a customer need, that's where we are going to be involved in the discussion around product relevance,"" said Catherine Knupp, president of research and development for Zoetis. She said the company would look for local partnerships for such projects.

370,"  * U.S. moves against tax-avoidance 'inversion' deals* Burger King-Tim Horton deal to proceed* Action may deter Pfizer from returning to bid for AstraZeneca   (Adds Kies, Scalia comments, background, closing share prices)By Kevin Drawbaugh and Soyoung KimWASHINGTON/NEW YORK, Sept 23 Tough new U.S. government rules on corporate ""inversion"" deals, aimed at making the tax-avoidance transactions less desirable, undermined share prices in nearly a dozen companies on both sides of the Atlantic on Tuesday.Analysts and tax lawyers were studying the damage to deals currently in the works and the outlook for future such deals, in which U.S. companies escape high taxes at home by shifting their domiciles abroad.Although the new rules will make some deals costlier and others more difficult, fast-food chain Burger King Worldwide Inc  said it will proceed with its $11.5 billion transaction with Canada's Tim Hortons Inc.""This deal has always been driven by long-term growth and not by tax benefits,"" the two companies said in a statement.Corporate deal-makers were surprised by harsher-than-expected changes to the inversions rulebook unveiled by the Treasury Department late on Monday. Inversions have surged this year and caused concern in Washington about the threat they pose to the U.S. corporate income tax base.Rule changes include blocking what the Treasury dubbed ""creative"" strategies to move cash around or to bring overseas profits into the United States without paying U.S. taxes, and redefining inversions to make shifting tax domiciles more difficult.Effective immediately, the rules will mean little for companies that have already inverted. But for at least 10 companies in the midst of completing deals, and for those considering inversions, the impact could be significant.Tax experts said the rules would have the biggest impact on  companies that invert to gain lower-cost access to unrepatriated profits, or earnings held overseas to avoid U.S. taxes.Burger King was not in this situation, said Ken Kies, managing director of Washington tax lobbying firm Federal Policy Group. ""It really depends on whether or not a favorable tax treatment of unrepatriated earnings was a key aspect of the economics of your deal,"" he said. ""If it wasn't, then what they've done here won't have much of an impact.""Still, most pending deals could become more costly for the buyers. They include AbbVie Inc and its $54.7 billion deal to acquire Ireland's Shire Plc, as well as Medtronic Inc and its $42.9 billion takeover of Covidien Plc. Neither of those transactions, the biggest of the year, was expected to fall apart completely, partly because paying a break-up fee to walk away would likely be even more costly. AbbVie would have to pay Shire a $1.6 billion penalty if it were to renege on their merger agreement, for instance.Medtronic has a contract that lets it or Covidien walk away from their deal if the U.S. Congress changes tax law. The Treasury's new rules fall short of that, so a break-up fee likely would loom in this case, too, if the merger were called off.Experts said companies would likely scrutinize the new Treasury rules for potential legal challenges, but that they could not count on the rules being overturned.CHALLENGES POSSIBLE  With a grid-locked Congress failing to act, investors had been expecting an Obama administration clamp-down on inversions. But the rules it announced were farther-reaching than anticipated, analysts at Deutsche Bank said.An inversion typically involves a U.S. company buying a smaller, foreign rival and reincorporating in its home country, where taxes are lower, opening a range of options for the combined business to lower its U.S. and global tax bills.About 50 such deals have taken place since the early 1980s, but the pace has picked up, with half of them completed since the 2008-2009 credit crisis, according to a Reuters review.One of the new Treasury rules will prevent inverted companies from using ""hopscotch"" loans that allow them to avoid dividend taxes when tapping tax-deferred foreign profits.Another rule bars inverters from gaining access to offshore profits by using ""decontrolling"" strategies that restructure foreign units so they are no longer U.S.-controlled.The Treasury is also tightening limits on the levels of ownership that former U.S. investors can retain in an inverted company for it to qualify for foreign tax treatment under U.S. law, a move that will make doing the deals more difficult.Finally, new rules would restrict ""skinny down"" and ""spinversion"" restructuring strategies that companies use to try to get around existing restrictions on inversions. The U.S. Treasury has acknowledged that one rule, which officials said was ""relatively small,"" is broad enough to hit even companies that are not inverting. A senior official said some cash transfers from non-inverted foreign corporations to U.S. subsidiaries could now be taxed.Treasury officials said any deals completed as of Monday were not affected, while deals completed later would be.Legal experts said companies would have more leeway to challenge the rules if they had been applied retroactively, which the Treasury decided not to do. But the rules will still be scrutinized, said Eugene Scalia, a lawyer at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher who has successfully challenged other federal rules.""When a federal agency says it's acting because Congress won't, that always raises the question whether the agency has proper authority under current law,"" Scalia said.Bankers and analysts said they expect more action on tax inversions from the Obama administration.""This move is a good and necessary start toward discouraging corporate inversions, which cost U.S. taxpayers billions in lost revenue,"" said Thomas Hungerford, a tax expert at the Economic Policy Institute, a think tank.SHARES DIVE In London, AstraZeneca, which had been the target of a failed inversion bid by U.S. drugmaker Pfizer Inc, slid 3.6 percent. The Treasury rules were seen as possibly deterring Pfizer from making another bid after a $118 billion takeover attempt failed in May.AbbVie closed down 2 percent in New York, while Pfizer, the biggest U.S. pharmaceutical company, dipped 0.4 percent. Burger King closed down 2.7 percent.AbbVie officials had no immediate comment.Other U.S.-listed issues under pressure from the Treasury actions included Abbott Laboratories, down 2.1 percent; Covidien, down 2.5 percent, and Medtronic, down 2.9 percent.

373,"  * U.S. moves against tax-avoidance ""inversion"" deals* Burger King-Tim Horton deal to proceed* Action may deter Pfizer from returning to bid for AstraZeneca   (Recasts with Medtronic comments, update stock moves)By Kevin Drawbaugh and Soyoung KimWASHINGTON/NEW YORK, Sept 23 Tough new U.S. rules on corporate ""inversions"" on Tuesday sent a chill through the market for the tax-avoidance deals, both pending and potential, with share prices falling sharply in nearly a dozen companies on both sides of the Atlantic.As investors sold stocks involved in inversions, in which U.S. companies escape high taxes at home by redomiciling abroad, analysts and tax lawyers were surveying the damage to deals currently in the works and the outlook for future transactions.Despite new rules that will make some inversions costlier and others more difficult to do, Burger King Worldwide Inc  said it will proceed with its $11.5 billion deal with Canada's Tim Hortons Inc, stressing that the transaction was not about tax benefits.In announcing their intention to proceed, the two companies said in a statement: ""This deal has always been driven by long-term growth and not by tax benefits.""The U.S. Treasury Department unveiled harsher-than-expected changes late on Monday to the existing rule book for inversions, which have surged this year and caused concern in Washington about the threat posed to the U.S. corporate income tax base.Effective immediately, the rules will mean little for companies that have already inverted. But for at least 10 companies in the midst of completing such deals, and for those considering inversions, the impact will be significant.Most pending deals could become more costly for the buyers, such as AbbVie Inc and its $54.7 billion deal to acquire Ireland's Shire Plc, as well as Medtronic Inc  and its $42.9 billion takeover of Covidien Plc.Neither of these transactions, the biggest of the year, was expected to fall apart completely, partly because paying a break-up fee to walk away would likely be even more costly. AbbVie would have to pay Shire a $1.6 billion penalty if it were to renege on their merger agreement, for instance. Medtronic has a contract that lets it or Covidien walk away from their deal if the U.S. Congress changes tax law. The Treasury's new rules fall short of that, so a break-up fee likely would loom in this case, too, if the merger were called off.'HOPSCOTCH' LOANS TARGETED With a grid-locked Congress failing to act, investors had been expecting an Obama administration clamp-down on inversions. But the rules it announced were more far-reaching than anticipated, analysts at Deutsche Bank said.""Inversion deals now are clearly going to be very difficult to pull off,"" said Navid Malik, head of life sciences research at Cenkos Securities.An inversion typically involves a U.S. company buying a smaller, foreign rival and reincorporating in its home country, where taxes are lower, opening a range of options for the combined business to lower its U.S. and global tax bills. About 50 such deals have taken place since the early 1980s, but the pace has picked up, with half of them completed since the 2008-2009 credit crisis, according to a Reuters review.A key target of the Treasury's actions is foreign profits held offshore by U.S. multinationals under a tax rule that defers taxes on profits until they are brought to the United States.One of the new Treasury rules will prevent inverted companies from using ""hopscotch"" loans that allow them to avoid dividend taxes when tapping tax-deferred foreign profits.Another rule will bar inverters from gaining access to  offshore profits by using ""decontrolling"" strategies that restructure foreign units so they are no longer U.S.-controlled.The Treasury is also tightening limits on the levels of ownership that the former U.S. investors can have in an inverted company for it to qualify for foreign tax treatment under U.S. law, a move that will make it harder to do the deals.The U.S. Treasury has acknowledged that one of the new rules is broad enough to hit companies that are not inverting. A senior official, who asked not to be named, said some cash transfers from foreign corporations to U.S. subsidiaries could now be taxed, even if not involved in an inversion. ""There's a relatively small provision ...which would affect both inverted and non-inverted, basically any foreign-owned firms,"" the official told reporters on Monday.Treasury officials said on Tuesday that the rules were effective immediately and that any deals completed as of Monday were not affected, while deals completed later would be. Despite this, some investment bankers on Tuesday expressed uncertainty about the finality and timing of the rules.Bankers and analysts also said they expect more from the Treasury Department. ""This move is a good and necessary start toward discouraging corporate inversions, which cost U.S. taxpayers billions in lost revenue,"" said Thomas Hungerford, a tax expert at the Economic Policy Institute, a think tank.SHARES REACT No two inversions are exactly alike, so the impact of the rules will depend on the aspects of inversion each deal emphasizes, whether it is protecting foreign profits from U.S. taxation or gaining access to foreign profits already deferred.In London, AstraZeneca, which had been the target of a failed inversion bid by U.S. drugmaker Pfizer Inc, slid 3.6 percent. The Treasury rules were seen as possibly deterring Pfizer from making another bid after a $118 billion takeover attempt failed in May.AbbVie slid 2.3 percent in midday U.S. trading, while Pfizer, the biggest U.S. pharmaceutical company, dipped 0.3 percent. Burger King was down 2.2 percent in New York.AbbVie officials did not have any immediate comment on the latest developments.Other U.S.-listed issues under pressure from the Treasury actions included Abbott Laboratories, down 1.6 percent; Covidien, down 2.4 percent; Medtronic, down 3.1 percent; and Mylan, down 0.1 percent.

374,"  * U.S. moves against tax-avoidance ""inversion"" deals* Burger King-Tim Horton deal to proceed* Action may deter Pfizer from returning to bid for AstraZenecaBy Ben Hirschler and Dan BurnsLONDON/NEW YORK, Sept 23 The U.S. Treasury's move to curb deals that allow U.S. companies to escape high taxes at home wiped a combined $12.3 billion off the shares of nearly a dozen companies on both sides of the Atlantic on Tuesday, as investors reacted to the surprisingly far-reaching action.But it was unclear whether the tougher stance adopted by the Obama administration on ""inversion"" deals that allow companies to escape high U.S. taxes by reincorporating abroad, which followed a wave of public criticism, would end any of the handful of deals currently in the works.Burger King, which is in the process of an inversion deal with Canada's Tim Horton's, said Tuesday it would proceed with its $11.5 billion deal despite the Treasury actions, saying the transaction was not about the tax benefits.Nonetheless, the shares of some companies involved in or interested in merger deals were dealt strong blows. In London, AstraZeneca slid 3.6 percent, while Shire fell 2.5 percent.The U.S. Treasury move was seen as adding some risk around the deal for AbbVie to buy Shire for $55 billion and might deter Pfizer from making another attempt to acquire AstraZeneca, after a $118 billion takeover attempt failed in May.AbbVie slid 1.7 percent in midday U.S. trading, while Pfizer, the biggest U.S. pharmaceutical company, dipped about 0.3 percent.More than a half dozen other companies in the United States and Europe saw their shares fall on the Treasury action.Tim Horton was the only stock in the group to gain on the day, with its shares were up 0.2 percent in Toronto, though shares of Burger King Worldwide were down 1.5 percent in New York. In announcing the intention for Burger King to proceed with its deal for Tim Horton, the two companies said in a statement: ""This deal has always been driven by long-term growth and not by tax benefits.""Investors had been expecting some action from the Obama administration to clamp down on tax-avoidance inversions but the steps announced on Monday were more far-reaching than anticipated, analysts at Deutsche Bank said.The new rules, effective immediately, will make new inversions more difficult to do and less potentially rewarding - but whether that will be enough to scupper deals that are pending or under consideration is not clear.The action follows months of political debate, with Democrats urging prompt legislative action and Republicans pushing to address the problem later, perhaps in 2015, as part of a broader overhaul of the loophole-riddled federal tax code.""Inversion deals now are clearly going to be very difficult to pull off,"" Navid Malik, head of life sciences research at Cenkos Securities, said.That could kill off prospects of Pfizer returning to bid for AstraZeneca at the end of November, when a six-month cooling-off period imposed by British takeover rules comes to an end and the U.S. group can publicly launch a new offer, Malik said. Other analysts were less certain. Andrew Baum of Citi said the Treasury move would have a limited impact on the economic case for a Pfizer-AstraZeneca deal - though the threat of additional measures could give the U.S. group pause - and he still expects Pfizer to return after the Nov. 26 deadline.Both Pfizer and AstraZeneca are bound by rules that mean they cannot comment on deal prospects. However, the British firm said previously that the controversial tax issue was a big risk for investors that could cause major delays to any transaction.The Shire deal may still go ahead, since it is already in train, although AbbVie will likely lose upside from planned tax savings, making the picture uncertain. The transaction is due to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2014.""Shire has enough momentum in its business and a good enough pipeline that it would be attractive to AbbVie anyway,"" Malik said. ""The tax inversion was the icing on the cake.""Shire and AbbVie officials did not have any immediate comment on the latest developments. INVERSION SURGE Other U.S.-listed issues under pressure from the Treasury actions included Abbott Laboratories, down 1.5 percent; Covidien, down 2.8 percent; Medtronic, down 3.5 percent; and Mylan, down 0.3 percent.In Europe, UK-based Smith & Nephew and Swiss biotech group Actelion, two other perennial targets of bid speculation, fell 2.8 percent and 2.6 percent, respectively.Inversions have surged in the past year, pursued by healthcare companies in particular, although the Burger King-Tim Horton's deal shows the appeal extends into other sectors.Medical technology group Medtronic, meanwhile, is working to close an inversion deal into Ireland with rival Covidien, while Mylan plans to buy certain Abbott's drugs in developed markets outside the United States in another tax-cutting transaction.About 50 such deals have taken place since the early 1980s, but the pace has picked up, with half of those completed since the 2008-2009 credit crisis, according to a Reuters review.A key target of Treasury's actions is foreign profits held offshore by U.S. multinationals under a U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) rule that defers taxation on such profits unless and until they are brought into the United States.One new Treasury rule will prevent inverted companies from using ""hopscotch"" loans that allow them to avoid dividend taxes when tapping such tax-deferred foreign profits.

376,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, September 26 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Pfizer Inc.'s  (Pfizer's) ratings, including the 'A+' Issuer Default Rating (IDR). The rating  actions apply to approximately $37.8 billion of consolidated debt outstanding as  of June 29, 2014. The Rating Outlook is Stable. A full list of ratings follows  at the end of this press release. KEY RATING DRIVERS --Fitch forecasts that Pfizer will operate with total debt leverage ranging  between 1.5x and 1.7x, driven by relatively flat profitability and debt levels,  leaving the company little flexibility at its current 'A+' rating.  --Fitch believes Pfizer will continue to aggressively deploy cash towards  acquisitions, share repurchases and an increasing dividend.  --The company's patent cliff is generally manageable with roughly 16% of branded  revenues exposed to patent expiration in the next three years. One of its  at-risk products, Enbrel, is a biologic that Fitch expects will lose far less  market share to generic competition than what typically occurs with small  molecules.  --Pfizer is making headway in shepherding a number of projects through its  pipeline. Notable progress has been made in advancing treatments for symptoms of  menopause and cancer and also for vaccines to prevent of neisseria meningitidis  and clostridium difficile infections.  --Fitch expects Pfizer will face incrementally declining organic revenues  through 2016. Fitch's expectation incorporates the anticipated performance of  Pfizer's mature, new and pipeline products, while factoring in patent expiries,  moderate macroeconomic headwinds and the beneficial effect of the Affordable  Care Act (ACA). --Pfizer will likely continue with narrowing its strategic focus on human  branded pharmaceuticals. Its efforts should improve long-term profitability and  growth, mitigating the negative effect of a less-diversified business model.  --Fitch anticipates Pfizer will generate strong free cash flow (FCF) and  maintain solid liquidity during the intermediate term, with significant cash  balances and adequate access to the credit markets.  LEVERAGE LEAVES LITTLE FLEXIBILITY Pfizer's current leverage (total debt/EBITDA) at June 29, 2014 of 1.72x, leaves  the company little flexibility at its current 'A+' rating. Fitch anticipates  that Pfizer will operate with total debt leverage ranging between 1.5x and 1.7x,  driven by relatively flat profitability and debt levels. FCF and cash on hand  should be sufficient to fund targeted acquisitions and share repurchases without  requiring additional debt. Fitch's rating for Pfizer does not incorporate any  large transformative acquisitions.  AGGRESSIVE CASH DEPLOYMENT TO PERSIST Fitch believes Pfizer will continue to aggressively deploy cash towards  acquisitions and (to a lesser degree) share repurchases. The relative intensity  between the two options will likely be driven by available targets and the  relative returns to shareholders. In addition, Fitch expects that Pfizer will  remain committed to an increasing dividend over time. In May 2014, Pfizer decided to abandon its attempt to acquire AstraZeneca (AZN)  for roughly $119 billion. Pfizer's proposed acquisition was based on strategic  portfolio opportunities and a more favorable tax status, particularly regarding  the repatriation of future foreign earnings to the U.S. The company continues to  demonstrate its willingness to pursue large strategic transactions, demonstrated  by its recent pursuit of AZN and completed acquisitions of Warner-Lambert,  Pharmacia and Wyeth. MANAGABLE PATENT EXPIRIES The company's intermediate-term patent cliff is manageable. Over the next three  years, roughly 16% of the company's drug portfolio is at-risk of losing market  exclusivity, including two of its five best-selling medicines - Celebrex  (approximately 6% of total firm sales) and Enbrel (approximately 8% of total  firm sales). Generic competition in the U.S. for Celebrex is expected as early  as December 2014, and the base patent for Enbrel expires internationally  beginning in 2014. Pfizer does not have rights to Enbrel in the U.S. and Canada,  but does receive modest royalty income from Amgen for sales in those regions.  Fitch does not expect that Enbrel will face as serious a competitive threat from  generic alternatives as will Celebrex. Enbrel is a biologic, and a generic  biologic that is automatically interchangeable with Enbrel will not likely  emerge. Therefore, Fitch expects competitive challengers will require  significant research and marketing investments, making steep price discounts and  drastic market share gains by competitors less likely.  PIPELINE SUCCESSES Helping to mitigate the anticipated revenue challenges from patent expiries,  Pfizer has added new revenue sources over the past two years, including Duavee  (vasomotor symptoms of menopause), Prevnar 13 (pneumococcal vaccine expanded  use), Xeljanz (arthritis) and Bosulif (cancer).  The company is making progress with late-stage pipeline candidates, such as  tafamidis (polyneuropathy), bivalent rLP2086 (Neisseria meningitidis vaccine),  PF-06425090 (Clostridium difficile vaccine) and palbociclib (breast cancer). In  addition, Pfizer is conducting clinical trials that could expand the market of  currently marketed products by garnering regulatory approvals for their broader  clinical use. NARROWING STRATEGIC FOCUS Fitch anticipates that Pfizer will continue to sharpen its strategic focus on  human branded pharmaceuticals. While decreasing the diversity of its product  portfolio, an increased focus will enable the company to improve the  productivity of its core operations, including research & development, marketing  and manufacturing. Fitch believes the company's Global Established  Pharmaceuticals business and its Consumer Health business are possible  divestment candidates. EXPECTED SOFT ORGANIC REVENUES Fitch expects the net effect of patent-protected product sales, lost share due  to products with near-term patent expirations and the ramp up of recently  introduced products will result in slightly declining organic revenues through  2016. Fitch's revenue forecast assumes moderate uptake of recently launched  products, Celebrex's loss of market exclusivity in December 2014, Enbrel's loss  of European market exclusivity in 2014, and Lyrica's loss of market exclusivity  in Europe in 2013. In addition, the persistence of weak macroeconomic trends  presents a headwind, while somewhat offset by a modest tailwind from the  expected increase in the rolls of the insured in 2014-2016 from the Affordable  Care Act. STRONG CASH FLOW EXPECTED Fitch forecasts $6 billion to $7 billion of free cash flow (cash flow from  operations minus capital expenditures and dividends) for Pfizer in 2014. The  forecast incorporates relatively durable margins supported by a stable sales mix  and a strong focus on cost control. In addition, aggregate pricing across the  company's product portfolio is expected to be supportive for margins in the near  term. SOLID LIQUIDITY Fitch looks for Pfizer to maintain solid liquidity through strong FCF generation  and ample access to the credit markets. FCF for the LTM ending June 29, 2014 was  $11 billion. At the end of the period, Pfizer had approximately $34.1 billion in  cash/short-term investments and full availability on its $7 billion revolver,  maturing in October 2018. Fitch views Pfizer's debt maturity schedule as manageable and expects the  company to refinance the vast majority of its upcoming maturities with  additional borrowings. Pfizer has approximately $3 billion of long-term debt  maturing in 2015, $4.3 billion in 2016 and $4 billion in 2017. RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: While Fitch does not anticipate a positive rating action in the near  term, future developments that may individually or collectively, lead to such an  action include: --If Pfizer maintains gross debt leverage in the range of 1.0x to 1.3x; --If the company sustains strong operational performance through the current  patent cliff period, including relatively stable to positive trends in revenues,  margins and FCF Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a  negative rating action include: --If pressure on operations is significant enough to result in sustained gross  debt leverage greater than 1.7x as a possible result of marketplace pressures,  adverse actions from regulatory bodies or unfavorable clinical developments; --If Pfizer pursues a transaction (acquisitions/share repurchases) that places  pressure on gross leverage without the expectation of delveraging in a timely  manner. DEBT ISSUE RATINGS Fitch has affirmed Pfizer Inc.'s ratings as follows: --IDR at 'A+'; --Short-term IDR at 'F1'.  --Commercial paper program at 'F1'; --Credit facility at 'A+'; --Senior unsecured notes at 'A+'. The ratings apply to roughly $30.9 billion of debt (excluding subsidiary debt)  outstanding at June 29, 2014. The Rating Outlook is Stable. Fitch has also affirmed the ratings of Pfizer's consolidated subsidiaries as  follows: Wyeth LLC --IDR at 'A+'; --Senior unsecured notes at 'A+'. The ratings apply to roughly $5.5 billion of subsidiary debt outstanding at June  29, 2014. The Rating Outlook is Stable. Pharmacia Corp. --IDR at 'A+'; --Senior unsecured notes at 'A+'. The ratings apply to roughly $1.4 billion of subsidiary debt outstanding at June  29, 2014. The Rating Outlook is Stable.

377,"   By Bill Berkrot  Pfizer Inc's Xalkori, which treats lung cancer patients with a specific gene mutation, proved effective in shrinking tumors in those with an even rarer form of the disease, according to data presented at a medical meeting on Saturday.In the study of 50 non-small cell lung cancer patients with a rearrangement of the ROS1 gene, Xalkori treatment led to significant tumor shrinkage in 36 of them, or 72 percent, and halted tumor growth in an additional 9 patients, researchers reported.Xalkori, known chemically as crizotinib, was approved to treat patients with a mutation of the ALK gene, along with a companion diagnostic test to identify those with the mutation, which accounts for about 4 percent of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC). About 1 to 2 percent of NSCLC patients are believed to be ROS1 positive - the result of a fusion of two genes that are usually separate.""This is the first definitive study to establish crizotinib's activity in a large group of patients with ROS1-positive lung cancer and confirms that ROS1 is a bona fide therapeutic target in those patients,"" Dr. Alice Shaw, the study's lead investigator from the Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center in Boston, said in a statement.The average duration of response to the oral drug taken twice daily was 17 months, and half of the patients were still receiving treatment with no evidence of tumor progression, researchers said. ""The remissions induced by crizotinib in ROS1-positive patients are quite prolonged, and (treatment) resistance appears to emerge much later, on average, than what we have seen with other targeted therapies for lung cancer and melanoma,"" Shaw said. The study was presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) meeting in Madrid and published in the New England Journal of Medicine.Advances in diagnostic tools and the understanding of human genetics have enabled doctors to identify patients with the ROS1 mutation. ""This is a great example of success in personalized medicine,"" said Dr. John Iafrate, medical director of  Massachusetts General's Center for Integrated Diagnostics and one of the study's leaders.

379,"  (Adds analyst comment)By Deena BeasleyOct 5 Medical equipment supplier Becton Dickinson & Co has agreed to buy CareFusion Corp , a maker of infusion pumps and other medical devices, for $12.2 billion in cash and stock, marking the latest multibillion-dollar healthcare sector deal.Becton said on Sunday it would pay a total of $58.00 a share - $49.00 in cash and 0.0777 of a share of Becton Dickinson - for each share of CareFusion. This would represent a premium of 26 percent to the closing price on Oct. 3.The acquisition, recommended by the boards of both companies, would aim to combine the two U.S.-based companies' complementary products for preparing, administering and monitoring medications and would also extend the companies' geographic reach.Becton Dickinson makes products to deliver and administer drugs, like disposable needles, syringes and intravenous catheters, while CareFusion makes products to store the drugs and to deliver them, such as infusion pumps.""The combined entity will offer a 'one-stop-shop' solution for hospitals, which are looking for sourcing efficiencies as they navigate a tough healthcare environment,"" ISI Group analyst Vijay Kumar said in a research note. He said the new company will be a market leader in the $20 billion medication management segment.A combined company ""could improve patient safety plus reduce costs at the same time,"" said Vincent Forlenza, Becton Dickinson's chairman, chief executive officer and president in a telephone interview. Cost-related healthcare reforms, including those mandated under President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act, have spurred consolidation for U.S. health systems and hospitals, the main customer for suppliers of medical equipment.""This is an industry that from a customer perspective is consolidating,"" said Kieran Gallahue, CareFusion's chairman and CEO. ""Healthcare systems around the globe are looking for companies that can bring greater scale to them - it is a way to drive down costs while improving safety.""Forlenza said Becton's geographic reach - around 60 percent of its sales are outside of the United States and 25 percent of sales are in emerging markets - offers a strong platform for products from CareFusion, which currently relies on the domestic market for 75 percent of its revenue. Becton said the transaction is expected to provide double-digit earnings growth, on an adjusted basis, in the first full year, and will be accretive to net earnings in fiscal year 2018.Kumar estimated that in its first year, the deal would increase Becton's cash earnings per share by 15 percent. On a ""fully synergized"" basis, he expects the deal to be 40 percent accretive to cash EPS.Healthcare companies have been merging at a record pace, with year-to-date activity topping $346 billion, compared to $212 billion in the year-ago period, Thomson Reuters data  showed as of September.Medical device maker Medtronic Inc's planned acquisition of Covidien Plc for $43 billion is another recent deal aimed at increasing supplier leverage in negotiating sales to hospitals. Other recent large deals in the healthcare sector have included AbbVie Inc's planned $54 billion acquisition of Shire Plc. AstraZeneca Plc fended off a $118 billion takeover attempt by Pfizer Inc.Each of those transactions involved so-called ""tax inversion"" in which U.S. companies look to avoid high taxes by acquiring overseas assets and reincorporating in countries with lower tax rates. In reaction, the U.S. government last month took measures aimed at limiting the benefits of redomiciling overseas.The Becton-CareFusion deal is not a tax inversion - CareFusion is based in San Diego, while Becton is headquartered in Franklin Lakes, New Jersey.The deal, subject to regulatory and CareFusion shareholder approvals and customary closing conditions, is expected to close in the first half of next year.At closing, the companies said Becton Dickinson shareholders will own around 92 percent of the combined company and CareFusion shareholders will own around 8 percent.Goldman, Sachs & Co served as financial advisor to Becton Dickinson, and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP provided legal counsel. Perella Weinberg Partners LP and Barclays Plc. served as financial advisors to CareFusion, while Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz acted as its legal advisor.

380,"  (Corrects paragraph 5 to say the EpiPen is produced my Mylan Inc, not Pfizer Inc)Oct 9 Impax Laboratories Inc said it gained access to an emergency anti-allergen injection, epinephrine, by acquiring two privately held Pennsylvania drugmakers for $700 million.Epinephrine is used to fight sudden allergic reactions such as severe rashes and swelling of the windpipe.Impax said it bought Lineage Therapeutics Inc, which sells a generic epinephrine drug administered through its USP auto-injector system, and Tower Holdings Inc.Tower, which like Lineage is based in Horsham, Pennsylvania, makes Adrenaclick, the branded version of the Lineage drug.Both products compete with Mylan Inc's EpiPen, far and away the leader in the nearly $1 billion market. Impax's shares rose 11.2 percent to $26.52 in premarket trading on Thursday.Four out of every 100 children in the United States have a food allergy, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most allergic reactions are caused by food, insect stings, medications and materials such as latex.Impax's deal comes nearly two months after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration raised concerns about the company's factory in Taiwan, casting doubt on the future of its experimental Parkinson's drug, Rytary. Impax moved its manufacturing operations to Taiwan in June last year after the FDA cited problems in it manufacturing plant in California.Rytary is the only drug the company is developing on its own. Nearly 94 percent of Impax's second-quarter revenue of $188 million came from the sale of generic products. Hayward, California-based Impax said the deal would add about 90 cents per share to 2015 earnings.Analysts currently expect the company to report earnings of 75 cents per share in 2015.Thursday's deal includes seven generic products and a drug to treat parasitic worm infections, Albenza.Tower Holdings and Lineage Therapeutics are expected to generate revenue of $215 million-$225 million in 2014, Impax said.Up to Wednesday's close, Impax's stock had dropped 5.2 percent this year.

The panel is not obligated to follow the recommendations, although it typically does so.Chantix, once touted as Pfizer's next blockbuster drug, has also faced scrutiny over its possible links to heart problems and seizures.Pfizer paid out $273 million in 2012 to settle about 80 percent of known lawsuits related to Chantix. Sales of the drug fell to $648 million in 2013, compared with $883 million in its first full year of sales in 2007.Five not-for-profit organizations filed a citizen petition last week after Pfizer applied to the regulator to remove the warning.The petition asked the FDA to include risks of aggression/violence, psychosis, and depression to the black box warning.

387,"   By Anjuli Davies | LONDON  LONDON A decision by U.S. drugmaker AbbVie (ABBV.N) to scrap its plans to buy Dublin-based Shire (SHP.L) could mean that bankers miss out on up to $135 million in fees linked to the deal.Wall Street bank JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) risks being the biggest loser. It was sole adviser to Abbvie and had been set to earn $45 million in fees, a substantial portion of which were to be paid on completion, according to Abbvie's deal prospectus. Shire's advisers  -- Goldman Sachs (GS.N), Morgan Stanley (MS.N), Citi (C.N), Deutsche Bank  (DBKGn.DE) and Evercore (EVR.N) -- were set to share a fee pool of between $70 and $90 million, according to estimates from Thomson Reuters/Freeman Consulting. It is not known how much could still be payable to advisors. Bankers will typically earn about 10 percent of the fee total if a deal fails, according to the consulting firm.For example, British water company Severn Trent paid 19 million pounds ($30.4 million) in fees to its legal and financial advisers when it fended off a takeover bid by a Canadian-led consortium of investors in 2013. ""If a deal is hostile, defense advisers tend to get full fees,"" Lam Nguyen, director at Freeman told Reuters.  ""But even though this deal was not hostile, the target's advisers might be liable to share a piece of the break-up fee but it really depends case-by-case"", he added. JPMorgan, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley declined to comment. Evercore and Citi could not immediately be reached for comment. Abbvie was also set to pay $220 million in financing-related transaction fees, according to the prospectus, including $137 million for the establishment of an undrawn bridge facility arranged by JPMorgan.  AbbVie has recommended shareholders vote against the proposed $55 billion takeover of Shire after a change in U.S. tax rules. The U-turn hands a major scalp to the U.S. Treasury, which has been fighting to make tax-avoiding acquisitions more difficult and could deter further dealmaking. Abbvie is also liable to pay a break-up fee of about $1.64 billion if AbbVie's shareholders follow the advice and reject the transaction. The Shire episode has also fueled doubts about whether Pfizer (PFE.N), which abandoned a $118 billion bid for AstraZeneca (AZN.L) in May after its offer was rejected, will ever make another run at its British rival.Global investment banking fees in the first nine months of the year were at their strongest level since 2007, totaling $68.8 billion as a string of mega deals drove deal volumes up 60.1 percent to $2.66 trillion, Thomson Reuters data shows. JPMorgan topped the global investment banking league table during the period with $5 billion in fees or 7.2 percent of overall wallet-share (Editing by Keith Weir)",2014-10-16,PFE,"Thu Oct 16, 2014 | 10:39am EDT",Banks could miss out on $135 million fees as Abbvie drops Shire deal,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-shire-m-a-abbvie-fees-idUSKCN0I51UG20141016?type=companyNews

391,"  * Governments or multilateral agencies may offer indemnity* Topic expected to be discussed at Geneva vaccines meeting* Companies say issue won't delay accelerated vaccine work* Pfizer could help with production as companies join forces   (Adds comment on Pfizer role, reaction from Sierra Leone)By Ben Hirschler and Stephanie NebehayLONDON/GENEVA, Oct 23 Drugmakers are looking for some kind of indemnity from governments or multilateral agencies against possible losses or claims arising from the widespread emergency use of new Ebola vaccines in Africa.While the issue will not delay the industry's work to accelerate production and clinical testing of three experimental vaccines, it is likely to be discussed at a high-level meeting in Geneva on Thursday.World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Margaret Chan will chair the meeting, which includes industry executives, representatives from countries including those affected by Ebola, drug regulators and funders.GlaxoSmithKline Chief Executive Andrew Witty said a system of indemnity made sense given the unique situation in which companies are being urged by the WHO to fast-track the supply of novel vaccines in a matter of months rather than years. There is currently no proven vaccine against Ebola and drug companies have been wary in the past of investing in the area, since the commercial opportunity is small. Potential losses or claims arising from the use of new vaccines would represent an additional hurdle.Many drug companies are now discussing ways to help out with production, including some like Pfizer that are not directly involved in Ebola vaccine development.Witty said indemnity was not a concern for the early phase of testing, when thousands of doses are expected to be given to frontline healthcare workers as part of a clinical trial programme in January, but it would be needed when vaccines were rushed into much more widespread use.""I think it is reasonable that there should be some level of indemnification because the vaccine is essentially being used in an emergency situation before we've all had the chance to confirm its absolute profile,"" he told BBC radio.""That's a situation where we would look for some kind of indemnification, either from governments or from multilateral agencies."" Brian Greenwood, a professor of clinical tropical medicine at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, agrees that drug companies should not have to shoulder all the risk. ""There would have to be some sort of guarantee,"" he told Reuters.MANUFACTURING CAPACITY Leading drugmakers say they are ready to work together to speed up the supply of Ebola vaccines. Johnson & Johnson research head Paul Stoffels, who hopes to produce more than 1 million doses of an Ebola vaccine next year, said he was discussing collaboration with both GSK and other companies such as Pfizer, which has significant capacity to make a variety of biotech drugs and vaccines.""We are looking at capabilities for biological production to upscale further,"" Stoffels said in Geneva.The meeting is set to discuss ways to streamline the vaccine supply process and ensure there are adequate financial resources.""WHO is organising this meeting to discuss how to access vaccines when they are proven safe and how to finance them,"" a spokesman for the United Nations agency said.Europe is also set to provide 200 million euros ($250 million) of funding to develop new Ebola vaccines, as well as drugs and diagnostic tests, sources said. An announcement on the European move is now expected for next week.""We are now in a situation where we are desperate and we are looking for solutions,"" Yvette Stevens, Sierra Leone ambassador to the U.N. in Geneva, told Reuters.GSK currently has the most advanced vaccine, the first doses of which are expected to be ready for use late this year, while clinical trials on a second vaccine from NewLink Genetics  have just started and J&J will begin testing a third one in January.""This is an unprecedented pace of development. We are literally doing in maybe five or six months what would normally take five or six years,"" Witty said. ""I've already ordered five production lines to allow us to expand production.""

393,"  * Olaparib recommended for treatment of ovarian cancer* Drug also being tested in breast and gastric cancers* AstraZeneca sees potential sales of $2 billion a year* EMA also backs new drugs from Pfizer, Baxter, Clinuvel   (Adds AstraZeneca comment, further details)By Ben HirschlerLONDON, Oct 24 AstraZeneca's cancer drug pipeline received a boost on Friday, as European regulators recommended approval of an experimental medicine against ovarian cancer.The green light from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for olaparib, or Lynparza, is welcome news since the product hit a road bump in June when a U.S. panel voted against its accelerated approval. AstraZeneca has flagged the medicine as a potential $2 billion-a-year seller.Olaparib blocks an enzyme involved in cell repair and is designed for patients with certain hereditary gene mutations. It also has promise in treating other cancers, opening up a substantial market opportunity.""We are committed to investigating the full potential of olaparib and have a number of studies underway in multiple tumour types including breast and gastric cancer,"" said Briggs Morrison, AstraZeneca's chief medical officer. The treatment is expected to be the first drug in the so-called PARP inhibitor class to reach the market in Europe.The EMA said its committee of experts on new drugs also recommended approval of Pfizer's Duavive for oestrogen deficiency, Baxter International's Rixubis for haemophilia and Clinuvel's Scenesse for phototoxicity.Recommendations for marketing approval by the European Medicine Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) are normally endorsed by the European Commission within a couple of months. An AstraZeneca spokeswoman said a final decision on olaparib's approval was now expected in January 2015. The British company also hopes to hear back from regulators on the approvability of the medicine in the United States by Jan. 3.Cancer medicine is central to AstraZeneca's claims that it has a strong independent future, after fending off a $118 billion takeover bid from Pfizer in May.As part of its defence, the British drugmaker set out a bullish set of forecasts for its drug pipeline and predicted that group sales would climb 75 percent by 2023.Most interest is focused on the company's rapidly developing line-up of experimental immunotherapy treatments, which boost the immune system's ability to fight cancer. Research presented at a cancer congress in Madrid last month suggests AstraZeneca is in a strong position in this field.Shares in AstraZeneca pared losses by 1130 GMT to stand 0.6 percent down on the day, after falling as much as 2 percent earlier on news of an $11 billion share buyback plan by Pfizer.Some investors saw the move as reducing the likelihood that Pfizer would renew its pursuit of AstraZeneca, although analysts cautioned against reading too much into the U.S. company's decision to continue its share repurchase plans.

394,"  LONDON/NEW YORK U.S. drugmaker Pfizer is to continue buying back stock, with the board authorizing a new $11 billion share repurchase plan, deflating expectations that it will make a new bid for AstraZeneca.Shares in AstraZeneca fell 1.2 percent by 0800 GMT on Friday following the news.The largest American pharmaceuticals company, whose shares gained more than 1 percent after the announcement late on Thursday, said the move was in addition to the $1.3 billion remaining on its current share buyback program.Pfizer, which has a market valuation of about $180 billion, earlier this year failed in its $118 billion bid to buy British rival AstraZeneca. It has an opportunity to make a fresh run at its target from late November under British takeover rules. Pfizer Chief Executive Ian Read has said the company is continuing to look at deals but investor hopes for a new bid have dwindled recently because of the introduction of new U.S. tax rules.The U.S. government's tax proposals are designed to make it harder for American firms to shift their tax bases out of the country and into lower cost jurisdictions in Europe, as Pfizer would do by buying AstraZeneca. The likelihood of Pfizer resuming its pursuit has also been diminished following the collapse of U.S. drugmaker AbbVie's $55 billion plan to buy Dublin-based Shire, as a result of the new U.S. tax regulations.     But while investors may well view the big new share buyback as another blow to the idea of a Pfizer bid, ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum cautioned against reading too much into it. ""We cannot and should not necessarily make that read-across,"" he said in a note.

Under UK takeover rules, it can make a new approach in late November.D'Amelio on Tuesday said the new Treasury rules issued on Sept. 22 create bigger roadblocks for inversion deals.

But Read quickly interjected, ""If we were to say 'prohibitively,' it would imply you can't do an inversion. I don't think they're prohibitively harder. They've made it more difficult to realize the value, and hence may influence what you're willing to pay to get an inversion.""In a conference call earlier on Tuesday, Read noted the Treasury Department has suggested additional restrictions may be coming. ""I can't predict what they are going to do - no one can,"" Read said, adding he was worried about the ""uncertain situation.""U.S. drugmaker AbbVie two weeks ago walked away from its $55 billion deal to buy Dublin-based drugmaker Shire, another tax-inversion deal, citing the new Treasury rules.

It was granted accelerated approval following tests in 2,800 adolescents in the United States and Europe.After receiving three doses of the vaccine, 82 percent had antibodies in their blood that killed four different strains of meningitis B that typically cause disease in the United States, compared with fewer than 1 percent before vaccination.The most common side effects associated with the vaccine included inflammation at the site of the injection, headache and diarrhea.It is the first approved U.S. vaccine that prevents invasive disease caused by serogroup B of the bacterium Neisseria meningitidis. It causes disease in an estimated 20,000 to 80,000 people a year globally, according to Pfizer.

Chief Executive Pascal Soriot, who has fought hard to prove AstraZeneca has a strong independent future and does not need the kind of mega-merger offered by Pfizer, said he would use the better financial outlook to accelerate investment in new drugs.The company will also get an upfront payment of $325 million from Aegerion Pharmaceuticals, after agreeing to sell the U.S. company its rare disease drug Myalept.Soriot sought to reassure shareholders new investments would be managed carefully by predicting that earnings next year would be no worse than the lower end of the range expected for 2014.""Cost control will likely be a major focus in 2015 as the company tries to mitigate the damage of finally losing Nexium in the U.S.,"" said Berenberg Bank analyst Alistair Campbell.AstraZeneca now expects ""core"" earnings per share (EPS), which exclude some items, to fall around 10 percent this year at constant rates. That is better than anticipated previously, but is offset by an anticipated currency hit of about 5 percent. Deutsche Bank analyst Mark Clark said market forecasts for EPS were likely to be adjusted down by a few percent for 2014 and up a small amount for 2015, though this was ""of limited relevance to the long term pipeline-led return to growth story"". Soriot is winning credit for building up the company's new drug pipeline.BUILDING UP DEFENSES  The biggest hopes are centered on cancer, where AstraZeneca is vying with rivals such as Bristol-Myers Squibb, Merck & Co and Roche in the hot area of immunotherapy treatments, which boost the immune system to fight tumors.AstraZeneca presented promising early drug data at a cancer conference in September and more results are expected at an investor day on Nov. 18, just eight days before Pfizer is allowed to make a fresh bid under British takeover rules.The investor day is seen as an opportunity to shore up defenses and maximize value from the pipeline. Analysts believe AstraZeneca is likely to give details of new experimental drugs that are set to enter clinical trials.Shares in AstraZeneca slipped 0.6 percent by 0850 GMT (3.50 a.m. EST), broadly in line with the European healthcare sector. Sales in the third quarter rose 5 percent to $6.54 billion, generating core earnings down 13 percent at $1.05 a share.Industry analysts, on average, had forecast sales in the quarter of $6.41 billion and earnings of $1.03 a share, according to Thomson Reuters.Although the pipeline momentum is certainly building, AstraZeneca still faces major challenges, with a raft of patent expiries expected to pressure sales and profits until 2017, according to analyst forecasts.  That reflects loss of exclusivity on AstraZeneca's top-selling cholesterol-lowering drug Crestor in 2016, as well as the coming hit from competition to Nexium, which is expected to have its biggest impact in 2015. AstraZeneca now assumes, for planning purposes, that no generic versions of Nexium will reach the U.S. market in 2014.India's Ranbaxy Laboratories holds the rights to sell the first generic copy of the popular drug but its continuing problems with meeting regulatory standards in manufacturing have delayed a launch.

They almost entirely remove the tax benefits,"" he told reporters. ""It makes a tax inversion much less attractive.""The collapse of AbbVie's planned $55 billion acquisition of Shire, in another deal driven by tax considerations, also highlighted the tax hazards, he added.Pfizer has not revealed whether it would consider a new run at AstraZeneca but CEO Ian Read said last week he believed tax inversions could still be an option. Under British takeover rules, Pfizer can make a new public offer for AstraZeneca from Nov. 26. Some investors think the U.S. company will return, while others are sceptical.""The likelihood of a bid has receded since the collapse of the AbbVie bid for Shire and the decision of Pfizer management to commence a $11 billion share buyback programme,"" said Ketan Patel, an analyst at Ecclesiastical Investment Management.Shares in AstraZeneca fell 1.8 percent by 1240 GMT, while the European healthcare sector lost 1.2 percent.FLOOR UNDER 2015 EARNINGS Soriot sought to reassure shareholders new investments would be managed carefully by predicting that earnings next year would be no worse than the lower end of the range expected for 2014.

415,"   By Nishant Kumar | LONDON  LONDON Hedge funds specializing in bets on mergers and acquisitions are starting to see investors withdraw funds, prompting them to take a more cautious approach after being caught out by more than 500 corporate deals globally failing this year.Part of a broader industry strategy aimed at making money from major corporate events, these deal-focused funds gained an average 13 percent in 2013, their best year since 2010, which helped them lure in a net $10 billion in new cash through August this year, data from industry tracker Eurekahedge showed.But a series of failed deals, including the collapse of a $55 billion tie-up between UK drugmaker Shire (SHP.L) and U.S. peer AbbVie (ABBV.N), has led to losses for some of the world's biggest proponents of the strategy, with investors pulling out $3.3 billion in the last two months alone.""The AbbVie/Shire break, in particular, has led to a far reaching de-risking exercise for many funds,"" said Pierre di Maria, head of event driven strategy at Cheyne Capital.""Those funds have reduced their gross exposure to deals in order to lessen their overall risk and to be able to face any upcoming redemptions,"" he added.        The year had started well as a combination of low interest rates, weak global economic growth and companies flush with cash boosted M&A deals. As of Nov. 10, deal volume was up 47 percent year-on-year to $2.9 trillion, Thomson Reuters data showed. However, at the same time, deals worth $580 billion have been pulled, the most since 2008, trapping many funds on the wrong side of the so called ""merger arbitrage"" trade, which aims to eke out returns by capturing the spread between a company's market price and the price at which it may be acquired.BOLD BETS  The recent blow from AbbVie pulling its bid for Shire -- after the U.S. government moved to curb deals designed to cut taxes -- has led to losses for the likes of Paulson & Co, Tyrus Capital and Elliott Management.  ""The deal breaks have made managers more conscious of political risk and intervention within the M&A space,"" said Jeff Holland, a managing director at hedge fund investor Liongate Capital Management.While the Shire deal was only the fourth-biggest deal to fall apart this year, behind the abandoned 70 billion pounds ($110.4 billion) bid by Pfizer (PFE.N) for AstraZeneca (AZN.L) in May, many funds had bet big on its success. That concentration was reflected in Shire's share price fall when the deal broke up -- 22 percent, about twice that of AstraZeneca when it went through a similar situation. Following the Shire deal collapse, merger arbitrage spreads, or the difference between a company's share price and the price at which it may be bought, on other deals widened by 2.5 percent on average as a number of hedge funds liquidated positions, presenting an investment opportunity for some, said Di Maria of Cheyne Capital, adding he had nearly doubled the size of his merger arbitrage portfolio. DEEP LOSSES          Hedge fund manager John Paulson, who invested 1.44 billion pounds in Shire on Oct. 14, saw his Advantage fund lose 13.6 percent in October, according to an investor, while Elliott Associates said it may take legal action against AbbVie for scuttling the deal and losses.  Another fund to take a hit was Tyrus Capital, which bet both on Shire's share price rising and AbbVie's share price falling. The $1.4 billion Tyrus Capital Event Fund ended October down about 6.5 percent, fund data obtained by Reuters showed.  ""This has raised questions about portfolio concentration of hedge funds on some risky M&A deals,"" said Philippe Ferreira, head of research at Lyxor Asset Management.""We are advising investors having a strong exposure to event driven to diversify their portfolios,"" he added.An index from Eurekahedge tracking event-driven funds fell 2.1 percent in October, its biggest monthly decline since 2011, highlighting their poor recent performance. Investors keen to capture merger arbitrage returns, which are less correlated to other strategies, but reluctant to shoulder the risk of losses from another big deal collapse, may also consider passive funds, which buy and sell stocks involved in deals but tend to be more diversified.Such a strategy has already outperformed the average active event driven hedge fund manager this year. The IQ Merger Arbitrage ETF, for example, has returned 3.4 percent this year and was flat in October.

416,"   By Pamela Barbaglia and Sophie Sassard | LONDON  LONDON Pfizer (PFE.N) appears unlikely to make a fresh bid for AstraZeneca (AZN.L) in 12 days time, when an enforced cooling-off period ends, and the U.S. drugmaker is now weighing other less risky targets.People with direct knowledge of the situation said Pfizer has been reviewing different takeover scenarios with a U.S. investment bank ahead of Nov. 26, when it is allowed to renew its pursuit of AstraZeneca under UK takeover rules.This includes a close analysis of the benefits of a tax-saving deal to buy Dublin-based generic drugmaker Actavis ACT.N, which has a market value of around $64 billion against AstraZeneca's $94 billion. ""I am pretty sure that no-one at AstraZeneca is ready to agree a friendly deal,"" said a banker who met with the British company recently and has insights into Pfizer's strategy. ""The hurdles are now getting bigger and bigger. A deal would take longer and would be more expensive. In that context, Actavis is becoming more attractive, although it would not be a great story,"" he added, explaining Actavis would not offer the same synergies and opportunities in oncology as AstraZeneca.Pfizer's Chief Executive Ian Read told analysts in October that the company remained interested in lowering its tax bill, despite a U.S. clampdown on companies using so-called inversion deals to move their tax base overseas.""We still believe that on a case-by-case basis there is meaningful value to be had from inversions,"" Read said. AstraZeneca Chief Executive Pascal Soriot, however, said last week that the risks of inversion deals had increased markedly since the U.S. rules changes, as evidenced by the collapse of AbbVie's (ABBV.N) $55 billion plan to buy Shire (SHP.L).  Many investors agree with that reading.""I would not put it (the chance of a new Pfizer bid for AstraZeneca) at more than a 20-30 percent probability,"" said Norbert Janisch, portfolio manager at Raiffeisen Capital Management in Vienna, which is a shareholder in AstraZeneca.  DEAL HUNGRY AstraZeneca has been buoyed recently by progress with new drugs but its shares, which are trading 25 percent above the level before news of Pfizer's interest emerged in April, still contain a takeover premium.

417,"  (For more Reuters DEALTALKS, double click on )* Pfizer reviewing takeover scenarios beyond Astra -sources* Chance of U.S. firm renewing Astra pursuit seen receding* Enforced cooling-off period ends on Nov. 26* Pfizer taking close look at Actavis as target -sourcesBy Pamela Barbaglia and Sophie SassardLONDON, Nov 14 Pfizer appears unlikely to make a fresh bid for AstraZeneca in 12 days time, when an enforced cooling-off period ends, and the U.S. drugmaker is now weighing other less risky targets.People with direct knowledge of the situation said Pfizer has been reviewing different takeover scenarios with a U.S. investment bank ahead of Nov. 26, when it is allowed to renew its pursuit of AstraZeneca under UK takeover rules.This includes a close analysis of the benefits of a tax-saving deal to buy Dublin-based generic drugmaker Actavis , which has a market value of around $64 billion against AstraZeneca's $94 billion. ""I am pretty sure that no-one at AstraZeneca is ready to agree a friendly deal,"" said a banker who met with the British company recently and has insights into Pfizer's strategy.""The hurdles are now getting bigger and bigger. A deal would take longer and would be more expensive. In that context, Actavis is becoming more attractive, although it would not be a great story,"" he added, explaining Actavis would not offer the same synergies and opportunities in oncology as AstraZeneca.Pfizer's Chief Executive Ian Read told analysts in October that the company remained interested in lowering its tax bill, despite a U.S. clampdown on companies using so-called inversion deals to move their tax base overseas.""We still believe that on a case-by-case basis there is meaningful value to be had from inversions,"" Read said. AstraZeneca Chief Executive Pascal Soriot, however, said last week that the risks of inversion deals had increased markedly since the U.S. rules changes, as evidenced by the collapse of AbbVie's $55 billion plan to buy Shire .Many investors agree with that reading.""I would not put it (the chance of a new Pfizer bid for AstraZeneca) at more than a 20-30 percent probability,"" said Norbert Janisch, portfolio manager at Raiffeisen Capital Management in Vienna, which is a shareholder in AstraZeneca. DEAL HUNGRY AstraZeneca has been buoyed recently by progress with new drugs but its shares, which are trading 25 percent above the level before news of Pfizer's interest emerged in April, still contain a takeover premium.The political difficulties of staging what would be the biggest ever foreign takeover of a British company also remain considerable, with a general election in May 2015 that the opposition Labour party, which opposed Pfizer's earlier bid, could well win.It all means Pfizer would, once again, have to try for a friendly deal, and analysts doubt AstraZeneca's board would come to the table for less than 60 pounds a share, against 47 pounds at present.Pfizer's problem is that the tax advantages of buying AstraZeneca are now considerably less than in May, when its 55 pounds-a-share offer was rejected.The U.S. group's need for a deal remains, however, given its vulnerability to cheaper generics and its relatively weak line-up of experimental medicines, which is spurring Read and his lieutenants to look at other options.""The truth is that Pfizer has never stopped looking at targets in Europe after the AstraZeneca debacle,"" said one  banker familiar with Pfizer's strategy.AstraZeneca, meanwhile, plans to set out its stall at a Nov. 18 investor day.

421,"   By Ludwig Burger and Ben Hirschler | FRANKFURT/LONDON  FRANKFURT/LONDON Pfizer (PFE.N) dampened investors' expectations of a renewed bid for AstraZeneca (AZN.L) on Monday by signing a major cancer drug deal with Germany's Merck KGaA (MRCG.DE), reducing the U.S. firm's need for Astra's products.Merck will get an upfront payment of $850 million from the U.S. drugmaker for sharing rights to develop its experimental immunotherapy drug with Pfizer. It is also eligible for up to $2 billion in payments based on the medicine's future success.Merck's MSB0010718C is part of a class of drugs known as anti-PD-L1 therapies, which work by blocking a tumor's ability to evade the immune system's defense.The exclusive nature of the deal means Pfizer and Merck cannot collaborate with any other drugmaker in the PD-LI or related PD-1 area, unless they jointly agree to do so.  Such immune-boosting medicines represent the hottest area of cancer research and are also a major focus for AstraZeneca, which has a rival anti-PD-L1 product in development called MEDI4736.Winning access to AstraZeneca's cancer pipeline has been viewed as a major goal for Pfizer, which was unsuccessful with a $118 billion bid for the British group in May. It has a chance to renew its approach under British takeover rules from Nov. 26. Shares in Merck jumped 2.4 percent on the news, while AstraZeneca slid 2.2 percent by 0510 ET. The British company's stock had already fallen on Friday after several people familiar with the matter said Pfizer seemed unlikely to renew its approach.Pfizer said immuno-oncology was ""a top priority"" for the firm but a spokeswoman said British rules did not allow it to make any comment on its intentions toward AstraZeneca.HIGH PRICE  As a result of the cost of the deal, Pfizer said it now expected its 2014 reported diluted earnings per share to be between $1.40 and $1.49, compared with $1.50-1.59 indicated previously.The drugmaker is paying a high price for a medicine that has yet to prove itself in full-scale clinical tests, reflecting intense competition among firms wanting to do a deal, according to Belen Garijo, who will head Merck's healthcare business from next year.Merck said in September it in talks about a partnership deal  for the drug, which is being investigated as a treatment for lung and ovarian cancer, as well as the rare skin cancer Merkel cell carcinoma. Pfizer and Merck will develop the German company's treatment as a single therapy as well as in combinations with Pfizer's and Merck's portfolio of approved and experimental drug candidates.Up to 20 high clinical development programs are expected to begin in 2015, including as many as six Phase II or III trials that could be used to seek regulatory approval.Merck's drug is some way behind rivals from Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY.N), Roche ROG.VX, AstraZeneca and U.S. namesake Merck & Co (MRK.N), so advancing it quickly in clinical tests with a deep-pocketed partner such as Pfizer makes good sense, according to analysts at Berenberg Bank.

422,"   By Ben Hirschler | LONDON  LONDON Pfizer's (PFE.N) deal to buy rights to a promising drug from Germany's Merck KGaA (MRCG.DE) will enable it to compete strongly in the fast-growing field of cancer immunotherapy, its research head said.Some analysts have criticized Pfizer for being late to the hot new area of cancer research but Mikael Dolsten said on Monday his firm had now put together a strong portfolio of experimental immuno-oncology treatments.The deal for Merck's MSB0010718C -- part of a class of drugs known as anti-PD-L1 therapies that block a tumor's ability to evade the immune system -- means Pfizer will compete with other ""first wave"" developers of PD-L1 or related PD-1 drugs, Dolsten said.""It gives a tremendous acceleration for Pfizer,"" Dolsten said in a telephone interview. ""I would see this partnership making us highly competitive within the first wave of immuno-oncology.""  In addition to sharing rights to Merck's drug, for which Pfizer is paying $850 million upfront and up to $2 billion based on future success, Pfizer also has other drugs designed to ""check"" different parts of the immune system.""It's part of a long-term commitment to immuno-oncology, so you will see Pfizer introduce every year for quite some time  new immuno-onoclogy drugs, either new checkpoint antibodies, vaccines or bi-functional antibodies,"" Dolsten said. Citing British takeover rules, he declined to comment on what the tie-up with Merck meant for Pfizer's interest in similar cancer medicine from AstraZeneca (AZN.L), which rejected a $118 billion bid from the U.S. group in May.As well as being somewhat later in the development process than rival drugs -- particularly from U.S.-based Merck & Co (MRK.N) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY.N) -- Merck KGaA's MSB0010718C has also been linked with lymphopenia, or abnormally low levels of white blood cells called lymphocytes in some patients. However, Dolsten said he did not believe this was a clinically significant concern. ""We don't see that as an issue,"" he said.

AstraZeneca, which saw off a $118 billion approach from Pfizer in May, is his biggest holding.The company's work on immune-boosting cancer treatments is advancing especially fast, Chief Executive Pascal Soriot said, meaning it can now formally add it as a sixth growth business ahead of the new drugs reaching the market.AstraZeneca's five existing growth platforms of heart drug Brilinta, diabetes, respiratory medicine, emerging markets and Japan currently make up more than half of its revenue.

""We cannot overnight replace (heartburn and cholesterol drugs) Nexium and Crestor. Those are tremendous products, they are very profitable and when they go they really leave a hole in the till.""

Executives from AstraZeneca presented details of its new drugs to investors at a six-hour meeting with analysts. The event comes eight days before British takeover rules allow Pfizer to renew its pursuit, an option some investors now see as unlikely after the U.S. company signed a major cancer drug deal with Germany's Merck KGaA on Monday that reduced its need for AstraZeneca's products.Soriot said it was ""hard to comment"" on the read-across from the Pfizer-Merck tie-up.Woodford said he thought there remained a 50/50 chance of Pfizer approaching AstraZeneca again, despite new U.S. curbs on the kind of tax-cutting deal Pfizer had planned to do, since the U.S. firm still needed to replenish its medicine chest despite the Merck deal.""Pfizer doesn’t really have a pipeline of new drugs but AstraZeneca does,"" he said. Most AstraZeneca investors have focused their interest on its cancer drug portfolio, particularly immuno-oncology where it has 13 combination trials underway and 16 planned.It is also making rapid progress with a new pill against lung cancer, called AZD9291, which is now expected to be filed for U.S. approval in the second quarter of 2015.Previously, the filing date was the second-half of next year and the acceleration means the drug will have gone from first tests in humans to regulatory submission in a record time of just over two years.AstraZeneca is in a race with U.S. biotech company Clovis Oncology, which is developing a similar medicine.Scientists at the British drugmaker also plan to move several more experimental cancer medicines into clinical testing that would boost the immune system's ability to fight tumors in novel ways.

The event comes eight days before British takeover rules allow Pfizer to renew its pursuit, an option some investors now see as unlikely after the U.S. company signed a major cancer drug deal with Germany's Merck KGaA on Monday that reduced its need for AstraZeneca's products.Soriot said it was ""hard to comment"" on the read-across from the Pfizer-Merck tie-up.Woodford said he thought there remained a 50/50 chance of Pfizer approaching AstraZeneca again, despite new U.S. curbs on the kind of tax-cutting deal Pfizer had planned to do, since the U.S. firm still needed to replenish its medicine chest despite the Merck deal.""Pfizer doesn't really have a pipeline of new drugs but AstraZeneca does,"" he said.Most AstraZeneca investors have focused their interest on its cancer drug portfolio, particularly immuno-oncology where it has 13 combination trials underway and 16 planned.It is also making rapid progress with a new pill against lung cancer, called AZD9291, which is now expected to be filed for U.S. approval in the second quarter of 2015.Previously, the filing date was the second-half of next year and the acceleration means the drug will have gone from first tests in humans to regulatory submission in a record time of just over two years.AstraZeneca is in a race with U.S. biotech company Clovis Oncology, which is developing a similar medicine.Scientists at the British drugmaker also plan to move several more experimental cancer medicines into clinical testing that would boost the immune system's ability to fight tumours in novel ways.

435,"  PARIS Former Wyeth chief executive Bernard Poussot looks to be out of the running to take over as the next boss of French drugmaker Sanofi, as Swiss rival Roche said on Friday he was joining its board.Poussot, who was schooled in Paris and ran the U.S. pharmaceuticals group before it was acquired by Pfizer in 2009, was seen by some analysts as a potentially good choice to run Sanofi.Sanofi has been hunting for a new boss since the October ousting of Chris Viehbacher as CEO, following a clash with the board over his management style.Sanofi's chairman, Serge Weinberg, who has taken the helm in the interim, said last week that France's high tax burden made it hard to recruit top executives, although he declined to comment on individual candidates for the job. Weinberg has said he will look for the best candidate, irrespective of nationality, but most industry observers believe the right person will at least have to be fluent in French. Olivier Bohuon, chief executive of medical devices maker Smith & Nephew, has also been tipped as a frontrunner for the post but people familiar with the matter said he told staff last month he had no plans to leave the British firm. Other names floated by industry observers include Olivier Brandicourt, head of Bayer's healthcare business, and Christophe Weber, president of Japan's Takeda. Pascal Soriot, the chief executive of AstraZeneca has also been suggested by industry observers as a potential candidate but is not expected to be interested.

Morgan Healthcare conference in San Francisco.He said animal trials of the experimental PCSK9 pill have demonstrated ""a substantial reduction"" in cholesterol.Trials of Pfizer's experimental drug bococizumab, a large-molecule antibody that is given by injection every two weeks, have shown that it lowers cholesterol by around 60 percent.""We view this as a franchise approach,"" Dolsten said.  He expects Pfizer's experimental PCSK9 vaccine, designed to induce the body to produce its own PCSK9 antibodies, to enter human testing in 2016.""Imagine going to your doctor to get a shot for cholesterol,"" he said, noting that, if successful, the vaccine might eventually be an annual injection.Amgen Inc, as well as a partnership of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc and Sanofi SA, are also developing antibody drugs that target PCSK9. Wall Street analysts have forecast that each of the three could reach peak annual sales near $2 billion.

446,"   By Kate Kelland  LONDON - The international charity Medecins Sans Frontieres urged drugmakers GlaxoSmithKline and Pfizer on Tuesday to slash the price of their pneumococcal vaccines to $5 per child in poor countries.In a report on vaccine prices ahead of an international donor conference in Berlin at the end of January, MSF slammed Big Pharma companies and said the cost of vaccinating a child in the world's poorest countries was now 68 times higher than in 2001.The ""skyrocketing"" prices mean many countries can't afford expensive new vaccines such as those that protect against pneumococcal disease, which kills about a million children a year, MSF's report said.""A handful of big pharmaceutical companies are overcharging donors and developing countries for vaccines that already earn them billions of dollars in wealthy countries,"" said Rohit Malpani, policy and analysis director for MSF's access campaign. Responding to the criticism, GSK said in a statement that it was already barely covering its costs with the price it charges poorer countries for its pneumococcal shot, Synflorix, which it said was ""one of the most complex we've ever manufactured"".""Many of our available vaccines are advanced and complex and require significant upfront capital investment to make and supply,"" it said, adding that to discount pneumococcal vaccines further would threaten GSK's ability to supply them long-term.Pfizer also said its pneumococcal shot, Prevenar 13, was highly complex. ""It takes more than two years to create one batch of Prevenar 13, encompassing some 500 separate quality control tests ... multiple facilities and hundreds of trained professionals,"" it said in a statement.

447,"   By Kate Kelland, Health and Science Correspondent | LONDON  LONDON Jan 20 the international charity Medecins Sans Frontieres urged drugmakers GlaxoSmithKline  and Pfizer on Tuesday to slash the price of their pneumococcal vaccines to $5 per child in poor countries.In a report on vaccine prices ahead of an international donor conference in Berlin at the end of January, MSF slammed Big Pharma companies and said the cost of vaccinating a child in the world's poorest countries was now 68 times higher than in 2001.The ""skyrocketing"" prices mean many countries can't afford expensive new vaccines such as those that protect against pneumococcal disease, which kills about a million children a year, MSF's report said.""A handful of big pharmaceutical companies are overcharging donors and developing countries for vaccines that already earn them billions of dollars in wealthy countries,"" said Rohit Malpani, policy and analysis director for MSF's access campaign. Responding to the criticism, GSK said in a statement that it was already barely covering its costs with the price it charges poorer countries for its pneumococcal shot, Synflorix, which it said was ""one of the most complex we've ever manufactured"".""Many of our available vaccines are advanced and complex and require significant upfront capital investment to make and supply,"" it said, adding that to discount pneumococcal vaccines further would threaten GSK's ability to supply them long-term. Pfizer also said its pneumococcal shot, Prevenar 13, was highly complex. ""It takes more than two years to create one batch of Prevenar 13, encompassing some 500 separate quality control tests ... multiple facilities and hundreds of trained professionals,"" it said in a statement.MSF's report said pneumococcal shots alone accounted for about 45 percent of the cost of fully vaccinating a child against 12 diseases.

All times in ET/GMT)  Apple Inc is expected to report one of its strongest quarters ever, helped by strong unit sales of its larger-screen iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. The new iPhones are helping Apple chip away at Samsung Electronics' dominant position in its home turf of South Korea, according to a monthly report released by Hong Kong-based market research company Counterpoint. November was the first full month that the iPhones were sold in the country. Some analysts have speculated that Apple, which gets more than half its revenue from outside the United States, will feel the weight of a surging dollar on its results.Wall Street expects Pfizer Inc, the largest U.S. drugmaker by sales, to report higher fourth-quarter results, helped by sales of new cancer treatments and growing sales of mainstay brands such as Lyrica for pain and its Prevnar vaccine against pneumococcal infections. Investors will look for clues about whether Pfizer is still interested in a mega-merger to help bolster future earnings, following its failed efforts last year to buy British drugmaker AstraZeneca and move its tax base to Britain.The Federal Open Market Committee begins a two-day meeting on interest-rate policy. Separately, the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond issues manufacturing and services indices for January (1000/1500), while the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas releases the service sector outlook survey for January. (1030/1530)Consumer goods giant Procter & Gamble, which said in August last year it would sell half its brands in the next two years and cut jobs to revive sales growth and save costs, reports earnings before the market opens. The company has since sold brands including Duracell and has undertaken several management reshuffles. Investors will look for more details on how it plans to fix its ailing beauty business, which brands the company plans to sell next and where it will look to cut costs, as well as comments on impact of a stronger dollar, which hurt quarterly sales at rival Kimberly-Clark.AT&T Inc, the No. 2 U.S carrier, will report fourth-quarter earnings following a flurry of promotional activity in the holiday season that analysts expect to have squeezed margins and pressured subscriber churn and addition of new postpaid users. Investors will look for details on 2015 guidance and AT&T's investments in the AWS-3 spectrum auction as the telecom price war mounts and the company readies to close its deal to buy DirectTV later this year.Amgen Inc is expected to post a higher fourth-quarter profit and provide its first forecast for 2015. Investors will look for news on the ongoing restructuring at the world's largest biotechnology company and any new insight into the potential impact of the approval of the first U.S. biosimilar of the company's drug Neupogen, as well as how foreign exchange rates will influence 2015 earnings.Bristol-Myers Squibb Co is expected to report lower fourth-quarter sales and earnings, amid falling sales of its treatments for HIV and the loss of diabetes drugs that it sold off earlier in the year to AstraZeneca Plc. Investors will focus on how the company's promising array of immuno-oncology drugs are faring in clinical trials, and how well Opdivo is doing after being approved in Japan and the United States to treat melanoma.The Commerce Department's durable goods orders report is expected to show orders rose 0.5 percent in December after falling 0.9 percent in November. Core capital goods orders are expected to have risen 0.5 percent last month after declining 0.5 percent in November (0830/1330).

Separately, Standard & Poor's releases its S&P Case/Shiller Home Price Index for November. (0900/1400)Diversified manufacturer 3M Co's fourth-quarter revenue is expected to rise by about 3 percent. Investors will be looking at the extent of the fallout from the strong dollar, given that 3M gets more than 60 percent of its sales from outside the United States.Chemical company DuPont is expected to report a higher fourth-quarter profit on expectations that it benefited from a rise in operating margins in most of its businesses. The focus this quarter will be on the company's response to activist investor Nelson Peltz's call to break up the conglomerate. Peltz, who nominated himself and three other members from his Trian Fund to DuPont's board earlier this month, has been stepping up pressure on the company to break up. DuPont has insisted that it is more beneficial to keep all its businesses together, but with a proxy fight for the board underway, the company could look to strike a compromise. DuPont has already announced plans to spin off its performance chemicals business and it expects to record a related $315 million charge this quarter. Investors will look for details on the spin-off and subsequent listing. Yahoo Inc CEO Marissa Mayer is set to outline the company's plans for the 15 percent stake in Chinese ecommerce giant Alibaba, when it reports fourth-quarter results after markets close. Investors are pressuring Yahoo to sell the stake, worth nearly $37 billion, in a tax-efficient manner and return the money to shareholders. But Yahoo, which is struggling to turn around its core business, may want to use some of the proceeds for acquisitions. Yahoo's plans for the stake could set the stage for a confrontation with shareholders and put Mayer's future at risk.Caterpillar Inc is expected to report fourth-quarter earnings before markets open. Analysts will be watching to see whether strength in the company's construction business in the United States offsets a slump in earth-moving equipment in the mining industry. A big question for Caterpillar's business moving forward is what impact the drop in oil prices will have on its business supplying equipment to the oil and gas industry. The market expects earnings per share of $1.59 for the quarter.Specialty glass maker Corning Inc is expected to post fourth-quarter revenue marginally above expectations, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine, due to increased demand for its Gorilla Glass. The company expected core sales in its specialty materials business to fall in the quarter as there were no major mobile launches. Analysts will look for a forecast for its cover glass business. UBS analyst Amitabh Passi sees an incremental upside if the company undertakes strategic alternatives such as the divestment/consolidation of Dow Corning.Lockheed Martin Corp, the Pentagon's No. 1 supplier, is expected to report higher fourth-quarter profit and revenue despite pressure on U.S. defense spending, as sales to commercial customers in United States as well as international governments picked up. Lockheed gets 17 percent of its revenue from international markets and 1 percent from U.S. commercial customers. Canadian National Railway reports fourth-quarter results after markets close. The Canadian company may be asked about the impact of lower oil prices on its crude-by-rail business, and about how its operations are running after last year's serious congestion problems. CN is expected to report a rise in earnings, to 97 Canadian cents a share from 76 Canadian cents, and revenue of C$3.12 billion, up from C$2.75 billion a year earlier, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.American Airlines Group Inc reports fourth-quarter results. While analysts were mildly disappointed with the company's lower-than-expected guidance for unit revenue in the fourth quarter, they expect bullish guidance for 2015, thanks to the plummeting price of oil. The largest U.S. airline by passenger traffic has participated in the full price drop because it does not hedge its fuel consumption.Hard-disk drive maker Western Digital Corp is expected to report second-quarter profit and revenue above analysts' estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine, benefiting from businesses upgrading computers and higher demand for storage used in servers and data centers. An improving PC market is also expected to help the company. Investors will look out for updates on the company's full-year forecast.Video game publisher Electronic Arts Inc is expected to a third-quarter report profit above estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine, as it focuses more on its big selling titles such as ""FIFA"". The company might see revenue fall after the smash success of ""Battlefield 4"" a year earlier. The videogame developer has been making a push to a ""freemium"" model, where games are free to download and revenue is generated through in-game purchases. Analysts believe the company's mobile growth may soon outpace the already rapidly growing mobile market.Virtualization software maker VMware Inc is likely to report a fourth-quarter profit above estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine. The company is expected to benefit from new license sales and contract renewals. Activist-investor Elliot Management, which has been pushing parent EMC Corp to spin off VMware since October, reached a standstill agreement with EMC this month, easing pressure on the company until September. Investors will look for commentary from VMware on the spin-off prospects and growth outlook. Freeport-McMoRan Inc, the world's biggest listed copper producer, is expected to report lower fourth-quarter earnings on the back of weaker metal and oil prices and volumes. Freeport, whose debt has ballooned to $19 billion in the wake of several oil acquisitions, is likely to announce capital spending cuts as it deals with a funding shortfall of up to $5 billion this year due to weak cash flow. Analysts expect the Arizona-based miner to cut dividends and announce a slowdown in the development of its deepwater Gulf of Mexico oil assets. It could also delay completing the expansion of its Cerro Verde copper mine in Peru. Asset sales and joint venture agreements may also be on the cards. The market will want an update on Freeport's negotiations with the Indonesian government on its contract in that country.New York-based Coach Inc reports second-quarter results before the bell. The company, known for its poppy handbags, has struggled to keep up with its affordable luxury competitors, particularly Kate Spade & Co and Michael Kors Holdings Ltd. The accessories retailer said this month it would buy privately held women's luxury shoe company Stuart Weitzman Holdings LLC for about $574 million, in an attempt to better compete with its fast-growing rivals.  Printer maker Lexmark International Inc is expected to report a fourth-quarter profit slightly below estimates, according to Thomson Reuters Starmine. Analysts expect currency pressure to have affected operating profit by about 20-25 percent and believe the company has cut costs to compensate. Analysts also expect lower revenue from the hardware and supplies segment for 2015.  Nucor Corp's fourth-quarter results are expected to be hurt by the rising tide of steel imports thanks to the strong U.S. dollar, falling domestic steel prices, and ongoing complications at an iron facility in Louisiana. Analysts expect earnings per share of 55 cents for the quarter. AK Steel Holding Corp also reports fourth-quarter results, with analysts watching for insight on steel prices and demand moving forward. The market expects AK Steel to report quarterly earnings per share of 7 cents.Network gear maker Juniper Networks Inc is expected to post fourth-quarter revenue marginally above expectations, driven by a rise in Web 2.0 customers and cable offerings. However, analysts expect to see weakness in routing, switching and security in the quarter and the first half of 2015, due to lower spending by U.S service providers.Coal miner Peabody Energy Corp is expected to report a bigger fourth-quarter loss, hurt by tepid demand in an oversupplied U.S. coal market. Coal producers are struggling with weak met coal demand and a U.S. rail jam that has impeded efforts to ride on a recovery in thermal coal demand. Investors will look for comments on the company's cost-cutting efforts as they expect Peabody to benefit from falling oil prices and a weaker Australian dollar. The company gets about 40 percent of its revenue from Australia. Investors will also look for more information on Peabody Energy and Glencore's joint venture at two neighboring mines in Australia's Hunter Valley in November.Canadian business-software maker Open Text Corp is expected to post a higher second-quarter profit, driven by demand for its cloud service business. A strong average selling price is also expected to help the company, which bought data analytics provider Actuate in January. Investors will look for comments on how the Actuate acquisition will help the company.Semiconductor maker Applied Micro Circuits Co will likely include an update on its progress selling new low-power server chips when it reports third-quarter results after markets close. The company is one of a handful to use technology adapted from smartphones to challenge Intel's dominance of the data center.Mexico releases economic activity data which will reveal how growth fared in November (0900/1400). Trade balance data will show how factory exports behaved in December, after posting their biggest decline in nearly two years the prior month (0900/1400).(Compiled By Astha Rawat in Bengaluru; Editing by Simon Jennings)",2015-01-26,PFE,"Mon Jan 26, 2015 | 2:56pm EST","What to Watch in the Day Ahead - Tuesday, Jan. 27",http://www.reuters.com//article/amers-whattowatch-idUSL4N0V54OG20150126?type=companyNews
451,"  (Repeats for additional subscribers)By Ransdell PiersonNEW YORK Jan 26 A new wave of experimental cancer drugs that directly recruit the immune system's powerful T cells are proving to be immensely effective weapons against tumors, potentially transforming the $100 billion global market for drugs that fight the disease.But top oncology researchers are concerned about the two emerging technologies, citing dangers seen repeatedly in clinical trials including the potentially fatal buildup of toxic debris from killed tumor cells and damage to healthy tissue. Such side effects could block regulatory approval if they aren't controlled, researchers and drug company executives said in interviews with Reuters.In some trials, the two new approaches, known as CAR T cells and bispecific antibodies, have eliminated all traces of blood cancers in 40 percent to 90 percent of patients who had no remaining options. The drugs could reap annual sales in the tens of billions of dollars for their manufacturers, especially if they can also eliminate solid tumors in such terminally ill patients.CAR T cells, or chimeric antigen receptor T cells, are T cells that have been removed from the body and attached through genetic engineering to an antibody fragment that recognizes a specific tumor protein. T cells are an especially powerful disease-fighting kind of white blood cell. The result is a drug with the killing power of a greatly enhanced T cell, combined with the tumor-spotting ability of an antibody.Bispecific antibodies are a twist on conventional antibodies, Y-shaped proteins whose two arms grasp for the same protein target found on cancer cells.With bispecifics, one arm of the antibody typically grasps a cancer cell while the other arm takes hold of T cells, bringing the mortal enemies into contact. The T cell punches holes into the adjacent tumor cell and injects deadly enzymes. Conventional antibodies, by contrast, don't directly recruit T cells.""Unleashing the killing power of the T cell directly on the tumor cells allows a large increase in potency of these antibodies,"" said Dr. David Scheinberg, chairman of molecular pharmacology at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.Investor excitement over these therapies have helped boost interest from companies including Amgen Inc and Roche  and have fueled a jump in share prices of smaller firms such as Kite Pharma Inc, Juno Therapeutics and Bluebird Bio.""We take patients that have failed every treatment, every chemo combination, that have just two to six months to live. You give them a CAR, and within 3 to 4 weeks you can see massive tumors melting away,"" said Arie Belldegrun, chief executive officer of Kite. The company went public in June and announced a partnership with Amgen earlier this month.CAR T cells could cost $300,000 to $500,000 per patient, if approved, making them among the world's most expensive drugs and testing the ability of insurers to pay for them, said Les Funtleyder of E Squared Asset Management. The hedge fund owns shares of Kite Pharma. Bispecific antibodies could command prices of $200,000 or higher, he said.The potency of the experimental drugs comes with some dangerous potential side effects. In the killing process, inflammatory chemicals from the medicines and the tumor cells, called cytokines, are released into the bloodstream and can cause fever, low blood pressure and rapid heartbeat that can be life-threatening. The drugs, because of their unique structure and how they work, make it harder to predict whether they will go astray, said Dr. Bindu George, team leader of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Office of Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies, who called CAR T drugs perhaps the most interesting new technology.Most CAR T cells and bispecific antibodies in development identify blood cancer cells by a specific protein, CD19, found on the surfaces of lymphomas and leukemias. Because the same protein can also be found on non-cancerous cells, the drugs can go off track and attack healthy tissues.""Our biggest concern would be an off-target toxicity that wasn't expected and we didn't know the cause of it,"" George said. In that case, ""we might have to ask (the drugmaker) for additional information, how the toxicity happened, what organ it was, and literally go back to the drawing board.""TAMING A POWERFUL DRUG Researchers have used anti-inflammation medications to tame some of the adverse reactions, not always successfully. A study of CAR T cell treatment sponsored by Juno for patients with aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was briefly put on hold after two people died. Unlike antibodies, which are excreted from the body within days or weeks, engineered CAR T cells are expected to circulate for years or even a lifetime in the bloodstream, potentially providing lasting benefits, but also risks.""You can start to reject normal tissues; it can kill organs or cause autoimmune disease, and you don't want that,"" said Zelig Eshhar, a professor emeritus of the Weizmann Institute in Israel who pioneered the CAR approach.To reduce that danger, researchers are attempting to build ""suicide switches"" into CAR T cells to turn them off after they have wiped out all signs of cancer.At least 30 bispecific antibodies are believed to be in development, including ones from Roche, Johnson & Johnson, AbbVie and Eli Lilly.A growing number of drugmakers are also racing to develop the first CAR T therapies, including Kite, Novartis, Juno, Cellectis and its partner Pfizer Inc, and Bluebird, in partnership with Celgene Corp. EXPENSIVE OPTION The FDA in December approved the first bispecific, Amgen's $178,000 Blincyto for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) that did not respond to previous treatment. The cancer, prevalent in children, is diagnosed each year in an estimated 6,020 Americans, killing about a fourth of them.One third of patients in the Amgen study had no detectable cancer for nearly seven months after receiving the drug through a month-long infusion.A main hope for Blincyto is that it will keep patients alive until they can receive stem cell transplants, their best chance of a possible cure.CAR technology may also come to the rescue where few options remain.""If doctors and specialists learn how to control this very powerful gun, CAR T cells could save hundreds of thousands of people in the United States,"" said Ori Hershkowitz, a Tel Aviv-based fund manager with Sphera Funds, which owns shares of Kite and rival CARs developer Novartis.A Novartis trial showed 27 of 30 children and adults with ALL had no signs of the disease after being treated with its CAR T drug. Some 78 percent of patients were still alive six months after treatment, while some sustained remission for up to two years.But everyone in the study developed cytokine release syndrome, including a severe form of it in 27 percent of patients.""It certainly needs to be watched and evaluated,"" said Usman Azam, global head of cell therapies for Novartis. He still believes the drug's benefits provide ""compelling hope that you can potentially cure patients.""Roche's Genentech unit is conducting a mid-stage trial of a bispecific antibody to treat head and neck cancer and colorectal cancer. It is studying a dozen others in preclinical trials against cancer, Alzheimer's disease and inflammatory diseases.Paul Carter, a Genentech executive, was cautious about the prospects.""It's too early to say whether this will be a home run, although there's optimism it will be at least a base hit that will help us figure out how to go further.""

453,"   By Ransdell Pierson | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Jan 26 A new wave of experimental cancer drugs that directly recruit the immune system's powerful T cells are proving to be immensely effective weapons against tumors, potentially transforming the $100 billion global market for drugs that fight the disease.But top oncology researchers are concerned about the two emerging technologies, citing dangers seen repeatedly in clinical trials including the potentially fatal buildup of toxic debris from killed tumor cells and damage to healthy tissue. Such side effects could block regulatory approval if they aren't controlled, researchers and drug company executives said in interviews with Reuters.In some trials, the two new approaches, known as CAR T cells and bispecific antibodies, have eliminated all traces of blood cancers in 40 percent to 90 percent of patients who had no remaining options. The drugs could reap annual sales in the tens of billions of dollars for their manufacturers, especially if they can also eliminate solid tumors in such terminally ill patients.CAR T cells, or chimeric antigen receptor T cells, are T cells that have been removed from the body and attached through genetic engineering to an antibody fragment that recognizes a specific tumor protein. T cells are an especially powerful disease-fighting kind of white blood cell. The result is a drug with the killing power of a greatly enhanced T cell, combined with the tumor-spotting ability of an antibody.Bispecific antibodies are a twist on conventional antibodies, Y-shaped proteins whose two arms grasp for the same protein target found on cancer cells.With bispecifics, one arm of the antibody typically grasps a cancer cell while the other arm takes hold of T cells, bringing the mortal enemies into contact. The T cell punches holes into the adjacent tumor cell and injects deadly enzymes. Conventional antibodies, by contrast, don't directly recruit T cells.""Unleashing the killing power of the T cell directly on the tumor cells allows a large increase in potency of these antibodies,"" said Dr. David Scheinberg, chairman of molecular pharmacology at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.Investor excitement over these therapies have helped boost interest from companies including Amgen Inc and Roche  and have fueled a jump in share prices of smaller firms such as Kite Pharma Inc, Juno Therapeutics and Bluebird Bio.""We take patients that have failed every treatment, every chemo combination, that have just two to six months to live. You give them a CAR, and within 3 to 4 weeks you can see massive tumors melting away,"" said Arie Belldegrun, chief executive officer of Kite. The company went public in June and announced a partnership with Amgen earlier this month.CAR T cells could cost $300,000 to $500,000 per patient, if approved, making them among the world's most expensive drugs and testing the ability of insurers to pay for them, said Les Funtleyder of E Squared Asset Management. The hedge fund owns shares of Kite Pharma. Bispecific antibodies could command prices of $200,000 or higher, he said.The potency of the experimental drugs comes with some dangerous potential side effects. In the killing process, inflammatory chemicals from the medicines and the tumor cells, called cytokines, are released into the bloodstream and can cause fever, low blood pressure and rapid heartbeat that can be life-threatening.The drugs, because of their unique structure and how they work, make it harder to predict whether they will go astray, said Dr. Bindu George, team leader of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Office of Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies, who called CAR T drugs perhaps the most interesting new technology. Most CAR T cells and bispecific antibodies in development identify blood cancer cells by a specific protein, CD19, found on the surfaces of lymphomas and leukemias. Because the same protein can also be found on non-cancerous cells, the drugs can go off track and attack healthy tissues.""Our biggest concern would be an off-target toxicity that wasn't expected and we didn't know the cause of it,"" George said. In that case, ""we might have to ask (the drugmaker) for additional information, how the toxicity happened, what organ it was, and literally go back to the drawing board.""TAMING A POWERFUL DRUG Researchers have used anti-inflammation medications to tame some of the adverse reactions, not always successfully. A study of CAR T cell treatment sponsored by Juno for patients with aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was briefly put on hold after two people died.Unlike antibodies, which are excreted from the body within days or weeks, engineered CAR T cells are expected to circulate for years or even a lifetime in the bloodstream, potentially providing lasting benefits, but also risks. ""You can start to reject normal tissues; it can kill organs or cause autoimmune disease, and you don't want that,"" said Zelig Eshhar, a professor emeritus of the Weizmann Institute in Israel who pioneered the CAR approach.To reduce that danger, researchers are attempting to build ""suicide switches"" into CAR T cells to turn them off after they have wiped out all signs of cancer.At least 30 bispecific antibodies are believed to be in development, including ones from Roche, Johnson & Johnson, AbbVie and Eli Lilly.A growing number of drugmakers are also racing to develop the first CAR T therapies, including Kite, Novartis, Juno, Cellectis and its partner Pfizer Inc, and Bluebird, in partnership with Celgene Corp.EXPENSIVE OPTION  The FDA in December approved the first bispecific, Amgen's $178,000 Blincyto for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) that did not respond to previous treatment. The cancer, prevalent in children, is diagnosed each year in an estimated 6,020 Americans, killing about a fourth of them.One third of patients in the Amgen study had no detectable cancer for nearly seven months after receiving the drug through a month-long infusion.A main hope for Blincyto is that it will keep patients alive until they can receive stem cell transplants, their best chance of a possible cure.CAR technology may also come to the rescue where few options remain.""If doctors and specialists learn how to control this very powerful gun, CAR T cells could save hundreds of thousands of people in the United States,"" said Ori Hershkowitz, a Tel Aviv-based fund manager with Sphera Funds, which owns shares of Kite and rival CARs developer Novartis.A Novartis trial showed 27 of 30 children and adults with ALL had no signs of the disease after being treated with its CAR T drug.

462,"   By Ransdell Pierson  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday approved Pfizer Inc's Ibrance, a potential new standard of care for  advanced breast cancer, in a regulatory decision that came more than two months earlier than expected.Wall Street has considered the drug, whose chemical name is palbociclib, to be one of the most promising medicines in Pfizer's development pipeline. It was approved for previously untreated postnopausal women whose cancer cells have receptors to the female hormone estrogen and who do not have mutations in the HER2 gene that can contribute to uncontrolled growth of breast cells.Such patients represent the largest proportion of breast cancer cases and are typically treated with the chemotherapy tamoxifen or letrozole, a drug used to prevent production of estrogen.Cowen and Co analyst Steve Scala has estimated Ibrance could generate annual sales of $3 billion by 2020.   It works through a new mechanism of action, by blocking two enzymes involved in cell division, CDK4 and CDK6. In one clinical trial, the average patient taking Ibrance in combination with the standard treatment letrozole went 20.2 months without a worsening of symptoms - twice the length of time of those taking letrozole alone.""This approval represents the first treatment advance for this group of women in more than 10 years,"" said Mace Rothenberg, the head of oncology for Pfizer. UCLA which helped test the drug for Pfizer, in a statement, said Ibrance produced ""groundbreaking results"" in studies conducted at the university and has potential to become a mainstay treatment. Ibrance will give a big boost to Pfizer as it attempts to bolster its medicine cabinet with new cancer drugs, including ones that work by harnessing the immune system to recognize and kill tumor cells. The largest U.S. drugmaker badly needs big-selling new drugs to boost its earnings, following patent expirations on many of its biggest brands and a relatively thin supply of promising drugs in late-stage trials.

464,"   By Bill Berkrot and Ransdell Pierson | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Feb 5 Pfizer Inc's $15 billion deal to buy Hospira Inc will allow the largest U.S. drugmaker to benefit from specialty generic medicines that are commanding far higher prices than traditional off-patent pills, industry investors and analysts said.High demand for many of its injectable sterile drugs, including outright shortages in some cases, has allowed Hospira  to increase prices in recent years.Pfizer said on Thursday it will be adding the business to its unit of ""global established products"" - now primarily a collection of conventional pills that have gone off-patent and steadily lost value due to competition from cheap generics.The combination will make the established products unit a more attractive play for investors should Pfizer eventually spin it off or sell it, a decision expected in 2017.""A lot of established products are diminishing assets, whereas the generics business is growing nicely for specialty injectables. The portfolio tends to be more durable,"" said Kevin Kendra, an analyst with Gabelli & Co, which holds Hospira shares. Pfizer said the $37 billion global market for sterile injectables in 2013 will double to $70 billion by 2020. Such products include cancer drugs delivered by infusion pump, intravenous medicines, pre-filled syringes, bags and vials used by hospitals.They are harder, and more expensive, to manufacture with the proper quality controls than traditional pills, and the number of companies that specialize in their production has dropped dramatically in recent years due to a wave of consolidation among generics companies.Hospira had a series of quality control problems beginning in 2010 at its plant in North Carolina and later facilities in India and elsewhere, since fixed, as well as several product recalls, contributing to shortages. ""It hurt Hospira when they couldn't supply, but now that they've gotten their plants fixed up, they're benefiting from competitors' own manufacturing issues,"" Kendra said.For the first nine months of 2014, Hospira sales grew more than 14 percent to $3.34 billion. Pfizer's established products unit saw sales decline 9 percent in 2014 to $25.1 billion.Pfizer can now vastly expand sales of the products it is acquiring due to its global presence. Some analysts say that will help justify the 39 percent premium it agreed to pay for Hospira, which makes about 80 percent of its sales in the United States. ""The combined company will leverage Pfizer's global commercial network to expand Hospira's portfolio into Europe and the emerging markets,"" JP Morgan analyst Chris Schott said.Pfizer's manufacturing expertise could also boost confidence in quality controls.""Pfizer is one of the best sterile products manufacturers in the industry, which should be comforting"" to U.S. health regulators, Suntrust Robinson Humphrey analyst John Boris said.In fact, industry experts believe the Hospira deal bolsters the case for separating the Pfizer established products business soon.""It would make that established products business that much more attractive on a global basis with this addition of Hospira's revenue base,"" said Len Yaffe, portfolio manager of the StockDoc Partners healthcare fund that holds both Pfizer and Hospira shares.

U.S. crude CLc1 rose 4.2 percent to settle at $50.48 following increased violence in producer Libya and on an expected boost in oil demand from China's central bank easing.Some euro zone concerns eased as well. Greece proposed a bridging program until the end of May to allow time for debt talks, vowing to do everything in its power to avoid default. On Wednesday, the European Central Bank abruptly said it would stop accepting Greek bonds in return for funds. ""The market's trying to get its hands around what's going on in Greece. There was an expectation it might blow up. Now, certainly in the short term, it looks like we won't be seeing any fireworks,"" said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial in Waltham, Mass.The day's move put the S&P 500 back into positive territory for the year after days of volatile price action, largely driven by moves in oil.  Pfizer (PFE.N) was among the biggest boosts to the S&P 500 after it said it would buy Hospira Inc HSP.N for about $15 billion to boost its portfolio of generic injectable drugs and copies of biotech medicines.

468,"   By Caroline Humer and Ransdell Pierson  Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) said it would buy Hospira Inc HSP.N for about $15 billion to boost its portfolio of generic injectable drugs and copies of biotech medicines.Pfizer is known for prescription medicines like impotence treatment Viagra and Lyrica for nerve pain, but many of its biggest brands, including cholesterol treatment Lipitor and painkiller Celebrex, have lost patent protection and are facing cheaper generics. The company needs new products to keep its earnings growing. Hospira makes generic versions of injectable drugs that are widely used in hospitals, through vials, syringes and bags, as well as pumps used to deliver them and other fluids. It also sells several biosimilars, or copies of biotech drugs, overseas and has others in development.Pfizer offered $90 per share in cash, a 39 percent premium to Hospira's closing stock price on Wednesday. Hospira shares soared 35 percent to nearly $88 on Thursday, while Pfizer was up 2.7 percent at $32.93.The proposed acquisition is Pfizer's largest since the New York company failed in its attempt to buy AstraZeneca Plc (AZN.L)(AZN.N), which rebuffed its $118 billion approach last year but has remained a subject of takeover speculation. Pfizer said the latest move showed its commitment to deploy capital and deliver revenue and earnings-per-share growth in the near term. The company said it expected the deal to add 10 cents to 12 cents per share to earnings in the first full year after it closes.""I don't think this deal is a game changer for Pfizer but helps them build out their sterile injectables business without wildly overpaying for assets, as the company has done in the past,"" said portfolio manager Les Funtleyder of E Squared Asset Management.Pfizer expects the deal, which requires regulatory and shareholder approvals, to close later this year, immediately boosting earnings and enabling the company to cut annual costs by $800 million over the next three years. Chief Executive Officer Ian Read said the Hospira deal would not delay any breakup of Pfizer, an action the company has said it could take by 2017 if an accounting analysis determines it makes sense.BIOSIMILAR ATTRACTION Drugmakers are racing to develop biosimilars, which typically cost 20 percent to 30 percent less than the original, as big-ticket patents on biotech drugs expire and cash-strapped healthcare systems cut costs. Biosimilars are expected to account for about one-quarter of the $100 billion in sales from off-patent biological drugs by the end of the decade, according to a study compiled by Thomson Reuters BioWorld.There are no approved biosimilars in the United States yet.Lake Forest, Illinois-based Hospira is seeking approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to market a biosimilar of Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ.N) blockbuster arthritis treatment Remicade. Pfizer and Hospira are dominant players in the hospital anti-infectives business and are also developing many of the same biosimilars, so Pfizer could wind up selling many overlapping products, Suntrust Robinson Humphrey analyst John Boris said.  Hospira is developing more than a half-dozen biosimilars in partnership with Celltrion Inc (068270.KQ) of South Korea and would therefore have to pay royalties on those products coming to market.""We don't think this is a major issue for the transaction,"" Read told analysts on a conference call.Boris said Pfizer would probably try to divest some of those assets to focus on its own wholly owned biosimilar candidates, including versions of Roche Holding AG's ROG.VX Herceptin for breast cancer, Rituxan lymphoma treatment and Avastin lung cancer drug, as well as of Abbott Laboratories Inc's (ABT.N) Humira arthritis treatment.The total value of the deal is about $17 billion, including debt, the companies said. Hospira had $1.75 billion in outstanding long-term debt as of Sept. 30, according to a regulatory filing.Pfizer's financial advisers are Guggenheim Securities, J.P. Morgan (JPM.N) and Lazard (LAZ.N), with Ropes & Gray LLP as legal adviser and Clifford Chance LLP advising on international regulatory matters.Morgan Stanley (MS.N) is Hospira's financial adviser, while Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP & Affiliates are its legal adviser.

470,"   By Danielle Robinson  NEW YORK, Feb 5 (IFR) - Merck & Co's US$8bn jumbo bond is just the tip of the iceberg of debt supply from the healthcare sector in the months ahead with brand names like Novartis and Pfizer set to compete for investor cash.At least US$50bn of debt is expected to be launched through  loans and bonds issues, and in a variety currencies including euros and dollars.Actavis, for example, is the biggest debt financing being readied to back its US$66bn purchase of Allergan. The line up also includes AmerisourceBergan, Merck kGaA, LabCorp and Zimmer. All need to finance acquisitions that have been partly driven by record-low borrowing costs.Pfizer joined that list on Thursday with a US$15bn acquisition of Hospira. About US$6bn of the deal could be funded with new debt, analysts said.Many of the companies have made acquisitions to strengthen product offerings as their old blockbuster drugs go generic.""A lot of pharmaceutical firms are struggling to find internal growth drivers and are looking for acquisitions to boost that growth,"" said Julie Stralow, healthcare analyst at Morningstar. The pace of M&A is expected to continue this year, albeit slightly slower than 2014 given the absence of tax-inversion trades, as companies take advantage of strong capital markets.""As long as low interest rates and high equity prices remain such positive factors, it's hard to see the M&A activity stop,"" said Stralow. BIG APPETITE Merck showed on Thursday there is no shortage of investor interest for pharma deals, and stock prices have consistently rallied on news of big acquisitions.The drug company attracted almost US$30bn of demand, and is set to lock in very cheap coupon rates. ""Investor reaction is extremely favorable to M&A with acquirers' share prices reacting positively to deal announcements,"" said Joe Kohls, co-head of global healthcare investment banking at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.""This, combined with the low interest rate environment and a focus on top and bottom line growth, is lending confidence to the belief that M&A is the preferred use of capital deployment within healthcare.""So far there hasn't been a problem with too many pharma bonds crowding the market, as acquisition financings have been well paced.That, however, is more of a coincidence than planning by either the companies or their underwriters.""We land the planes as they are ready to come in,"" said a senior syndicate manager at one of the five biggest bond houses on Wall Street.""Right now it's fairly orderly and the timing between landings is very manageable so as to not cause a glut.""

472,"   By Robert Cyran  (Reuters Breakingviews) - Pfizer has made more than its share of value-destroying acquisitions. The pharmaceutical giant's $15 billion purchase of Hospira could reverse that history. The injectable-drug maker's strength in non-branded medications should boost Pfizer's own generics unit - and open the way for spinning it off.Pfizer deals tend to look good in theory but fail in practice. The New York-based company spent nearly $220 billion buying Warner-Lambert, Pharmacia and Wyeth between 2000 and 2009. It promised huge value-creating savings, but the transactions and the cost cutting ended up confusing employees, turning laboratories into ineffective bureaucracies and prompting qualified scientists to flee. There's a reason Pfizer is worth only $208 billion today.The Hospira acquisition seems to have more going for it. Cost savings will amount to $800 million, according to Pfizer, with a present value, after taxes, of at least $1 billion more than the roughly $4 billion acquisition premium. The deal may also boost revenue. The company can expand Hospira's drug sales beyond Europe and North America and into developing markets, where Pfizer does a lot of business.Investors tacked almost $6 billion onto Pfizer's market value after the acquisition was announced on Thursday. Some may have forgotten the company's wretched M&A history, but more likely they see the happy possibility of a slimmer pharmaceutical firm.The company is, in fact, weighing a breakup in 2017 or later, continuing a pattern set by Chief Executive Ian Read. Since he took the helm in late 2010, Pfizer has sold its infant nutrition business for $12 billion and a pill production unit for $2.4 billion and spun off its animal health business. The company's stock has doubled over that period, easily outperforming the S&P 500.By 2025, patents will expire on a huge number of so-called biologic therapies - drugs produced in living cells - prompting the loss of more than $100 billion in annual sales across the industry. Hospira is big in the fast-growing and relatively new business of making non-branded copies of those drugs.Pfizer's generic medications division is, meanwhile, shrinking. If Hospira can inject some vigor - or even growth - into that business, the reward could be an investor-pleasing spinoff. CONTEXT NEWS  -  Pfizer announced on Feb. 5 that it had agreed to buy injectable drug-maker Hospira for about $15 billion, or $90 a share in cash.

474,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, February 06 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Pfizer Inc.'s (Pfizer's)  ratings, including the 'A+' Issuer Default Rating (IDR). The rating action  follows Pfizer's announcement that it will acquire Hospira, Inc. (HSP) for  roughly $17 billion which includes approximately $1.7 billion in HSP debt. The  rating action applies to approximately $38.9 billion of consolidated debt  outstanding as of Sept. 28, 2014. The Rating Outlook is Stable. A full list of  ratings follows at the end of this press release. KEY RATING DRIVERS Builds Existing Portfolio: The acquisition will add to Pfizer's global  established pharmaceutical (GEP) business, particularly in the area of sterile  injectable drugs and biosimilars. Both areas offer value-added margins and  growth opportunities within the generic pharmaceutical/biopharmaceutical space,  given the relative complexity involved in developing and manufacturing such  products. Conversely, the process for small-molecule drugs is relatively more  straightforward and commoditized.    Synergies Likely: Fitch believes that Pfizer can achieve its stated $800 million  in annual cost savings by 2018 through sensible integration, which it has  demonstrated successfully with past acquisitions. In addition, the acquisition  offers revenue synergies, given that Hospira's products are sold mainly in the  U.S. and Europe, while Pfizer has a strong presence in emerging markets, where  the company will be able to commercialize Hospira's products.  Future Plans for GEP Business Remain Uncertain: Fitch believes the acquisition  fits well into Pfizer's GEP business, given the increased scale and  complementary products and geographies. However, it remains unclear whether  Pfizer is 'building-to-own' or 'building-to-sell' its GEP business through the  acquisition of Hospira. Either way, the acquisition could, in the short term,  moderate the pace at which Pfizer pursues other large acquisitions. Still No Tax Inversion: Unlike Pfizer's proposed merger with AstraZeneca, the  Hospira acquisition does not offer Pfizer a tax-inversion benefit. Business  development risk remains, since the company may continue to seek an acquisition  that fits well strategically and offers improved tax efficiencies.. Fitch's  belief is driven by the Pfizer's persistence in pursuing AstraZeneca and the  sheer size of the deal.  Stressed Leverage: Pfizer has stated it will issue roughly $5 billion in debt to  fund the transaction. The company will likely assume Hospira's $1.7 billion of  debt as well. Despite Fitch's expectation that Pfizer will continue to generate  stable operating performance and significant free cash flow (FCF), leverage  could remain above 1.7x during the two years following the transaction's close.  This will provide the company with little to no flexibility to increase leverage  further within the 'A+' rating category. Manageable Patent Expiries: The company's intermediate-term patent cliff is  manageable. Over the next three years, roughly 16% of the company's drug  portfolio is at risk of losing market exclusivity, including two of its five  best-selling medicines - Celebrex (approximately 6% of total firm sales) and  Enbrel (approximately 8%). Generic competition in the U.S. for Celebrex is  expected as early as December 2014, and the base patent for Enbrel expires  internationally beginning in 2015. Pfizer does not have rights to Enbrel in the  U.S. and Canada, but does receive modest royalty income from Amgen for sales in  those regions.  Fitch does not expect that Enbrel will face as serious a competitive threat from  generic alternatives as will Celebrex. Enbrel is a biologic, and a generic  biologic that is automatically interchangeable with Enbrel will not likely  emerge. Therefore, Fitch expects competitive challengers will require  significant research and marketing investments, making steep price discounts and  drastic market share gains by competitors less likely.  Pipeline Successes: Helping to mitigate the anticipated revenue challenges from  patent expiries, Pfizer has added new revenue sources over the past two years,  including Ibrance/palbociclib (breast cancer), Trumenba (Neisseria meningitis  vaccine), (Duavee (vasomotor symptoms of menopause), Adult Prevnar 13  (pneumococcal vaccine expanded use), Xeljanz (arthritis) and Bosulif (cancer).  The company is making progress with late-stage pipeline candidates, such as  tafamidis (polyneuropathy and PF-06425090 (Clostridium difficile vaccine). In  addition, Pfizer is conducting clinical trials that could expand the market of  currently marketed products by garnering regulatory approvals for their broader  clinical use. KEY ASSUMPTIONS: Fitch's key assumptions for Pfizer's 'A+'/Stable Outlook include: --Flat-to-down organic revenue growth, which is more than offset by the addition  of at least $4 billion in base annual Hospira sales and potential gains through  the realization of revenue synergies in emerging markets during 2015-2016; --Relatively stable margins driven by new product introductions and the  achievement of $800 million in acquisition-related cost savings by 2018; --Annual FCF (cash flow from operations minus capital expenditures minus  dividends) of $5.5 billion to $6.5 billion during 2015-2016; --Leverage to decline to or below 1.7x by 2018 through increased operational  EBITDA or a combination of debt reduction and increased EBITDA. Pfizer does have  roughly $11 billion of debt maturing during the next three years, offering  opportunities for debt repayment' --No major business development initiatives that would meaningfully increase  leverage. RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: While Fitch does not anticipate a positive rating action in the near  term, future developments that may individually or collectively, lead to such an  action include: --If Pfizer maintains gross debt leverage in the range of 1.0x to 1.3x; --If the company sustains strong operational performance through the current  patent cliff period, including relatively stable-to-positive trends in revenues,  margins and FCF. Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a  negative rating action include: --If integration cost savings are not substantially achieved on schedule and the  company does not offset the shortfall with other operational improvements or  debt reduction; --If pressure on operations is significant enough to prevent the company from  returning to a sustainable gross debt leverage of 1.7x or lower. This could stem  from marketplace pressures, adverse actions from regulatory bodies or  unfavorable clinical developments; --If Pfizer pursues a transaction (another large acquisition and/or significant  share repurchases) that places pressure on gross leverage without the  expectation of deleveraging in a timely manner. LIQUIDITY Solid Liquidity: Fitch looks for Pfizer to maintain solid liquidity through  strong FCF generation and ample access to the credit markets. FCF for the LTM  ending Sept. 28, 2014 was $9.5 billion. At the end of the period, Pfizer had  approximately $33.4 billion in cash/short-term investments and full availability  on its $7 billion revolver, maturing in October 2018. Fitch views Pfizer's debt maturity schedule as manageable and expects the  company to refinance the vast majority of its upcoming maturities with  additional borrowings. Pfizer has approximately $3 billion of long-term debt  maturing in 2015, $4 billion in 2016 and $3.9 billion in 2017. DEBT ISSUE RATINGS Fitch has affirmed Pfizer Inc.'s ratings as follows: --IDR at 'A+'; --Short-term IDR at 'F1'.  --Commercial paper program at 'F1'; --Credit facility at 'A+'; --Senior unsecured notes at 'A+'. The ratings apply to roughly $32 billion of debt (excluding subsidiary debt)  outstanding at Sept. 28, 2014. The Rating Outlook is Stable. Fitch has also affirmed the ratings of Pfizer's consolidated subsidiaries as  follows: Wyeth LLC --IDR at 'A+'; --Senior unsecured notes at 'A+'. The ratings apply to roughly $5.5 billion of subsidiary debt outstanding at  Sept. 28, 2014. The Rating Outlook is Stable. Pharmacia Corp. --IDR at 'A+'; --Senior unsecured notes at 'A+'. The ratings apply to roughly $1.4 billion of subsidiary debt outstanding at  Sept. 28, 2014. The Rating Outlook is Stable.

475,"  (Repeats story that originally ran on Thursday)By Bill Berkrot and Ransdell PiersonNEW YORK Feb 5 Pfizer Inc's $15 billion deal to buy Hospira Inc will allow the largest U.S. drugmaker to benefit from specialty generic medicines that are commanding far higher prices than traditional off-patent pills, industry investors and analysts said.High demand for many of its injectable sterile drugs, including outright shortages in some cases, has allowed Hospira  to increase prices in recent years.Pfizer said on Thursday it will be adding the business to its unit of ""global established products"" - now primarily a collection of conventional pills that have gone off-patent and steadily lost value due to competition from cheap generics.The combination will make the established products unit a more attractive play for investors should Pfizer eventually spin it off or sell it, a decision expected in 2017.""A lot of established products are diminishing assets, whereas the generics business is growing nicely for specialty injectables. The portfolio tends to be more durable,"" said Kevin Kendra, an analyst with Gabelli & Co, which holds Hospira shares. Pfizer said the $37 billion global market for sterile injectables in 2013 will double to $70 billion by 2020. Such products include cancer drugs delivered by infusion pump, intravenous medicines, pre-filled syringes, bags and vials used by hospitals.They are harder, and more expensive, to manufacture with the proper quality controls than traditional pills, and the number of companies that specialize in their production has dropped dramatically in recent years due to a wave of consolidation among generics companies.Hospira had a series of quality control problems beginning in 2010 at its plant in North Carolina and later facilities in India and elsewhere, since fixed, as well as several product recalls, contributing to shortages. ""It hurt Hospira when they couldn't supply, but now that they've gotten their plants fixed up, they're benefiting from competitors' own manufacturing issues,"" Kendra said.For the first nine months of 2014, Hospira sales grew more than 14 percent to $3.34 billion. Pfizer's established products unit saw sales decline 9 percent in 2014 to $25.1 billion.Pfizer can now vastly expand sales of the products it is acquiring due to its global presence. Some analysts say that will help justify the 39 percent premium it agreed to pay for Hospira, which makes about 80 percent of its sales in the United States. ""The combined company will leverage Pfizer's global commercial network to expand Hospira's portfolio into Europe and the emerging markets,"" JP Morgan analyst Chris Schott said.Pfizer's manufacturing expertise could also boost confidence in quality controls.""Pfizer is one of the best sterile products manufacturers in the industry, which should be comforting"" to U.S. health regulators, Suntrust Robinson Humphrey analyst John Boris said.In fact, industry experts believe the Hospira deal bolsters the case for separating the Pfizer established products business soon.""It would make that established products business that much more attractive on a global basis with this addition of Hospira's revenue base,"" said Len Yaffe, portfolio manager of the StockDoc Partners healthcare fund that holds both Pfizer and Hospira shares.

476,"   By Caroline Humer, Ransdell Pierson, Vidya L Nathan and Natalie Grover  Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) said it would buy Hospira Inc HSP.N for about $15 billion to boost its portfolio of generic injectable drugs and copies of biotech medicines.Pfizer is known for prescription medicines like impotence treatment Viagra and Lyrica for nerve pain, but many of its biggest brands, including cholesterol treatment Lipitor and painkiller Celebrex, have lost patent protection and are facing cheaper generics. The company needs new products to keep its earnings growing. Hospira makes generic versions of injectable drugs that are widely used in hospitals, through vials, syringes and bags, as well as pumps used to deliver them and other fluids. It also sells several biosimilars, or copies of biotech drugs, overseas and has others in development.Pfizer offered $90 per share in cash, a 39 percent premium to Hospira's closing stock price on Wednesday. Hospira shares soared 35 percent to nearly $88 on Thursday, while Pfizer was up 2.7 percent at $32.93.The proposed acquisition is Pfizer's largest since the New York company failed in its attempt to buy AstraZeneca Plc (AZN.L)(AZN.N), which rebuffed its $118 billion approach last year but has remained a subject of takeover speculation. Pfizer said the latest move showed its commitment to deploy capital and deliver revenue and earnings-per-share growth in the near term. The company said it expected the deal to add 10 cents to 12 cents per share to earnings in the first full year after it closes.""I don't think this deal is a game changer for Pfizer but helps them build out their sterile injectables business without wildly overpaying for assets, as the company has done in the past,"" said portfolio manager Les Funtleyder of E Squared Asset Management. Pfizer expects the deal, which requires regulatory and shareholder approvals, to close later this year, immediately boosting earnings and enabling the company to cut annual costs by $800 million over the next three years.Chief Executive Officer Ian Read said the Hospira deal would not delay any breakup of Pfizer, an action the company has said it could take by 2017 if an accounting analysis determines it makes sense.BIOSIMILAR ATTRACTION  Drugmakers are racing to develop biosimilars, which typically cost 20 percent to 30 percent less than the original, as big-ticket patents on biotech drugs expire and cash-strapped healthcare systems cut costs.Biosimilars are expected to account for about one-quarter of the $100 billion in sales from off-patent biological drugs by the end of the decade, according to a study compiled by Thomson Reuters BioWorld.There are no approved biosimilars in the United States yet.Lake Forest, Illinois-based Hospira is seeking approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to market a biosimilar of Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ.N) blockbuster arthritis treatment Remicade.  Pfizer and Hospira are dominant players in the hospital anti-infectives business and are also developing many of the same biosimilars, so Pfizer could wind up selling many overlapping products, Suntrust Robinson Humphrey analyst John Boris said. Hospira is developing more than a half-dozen biosimilars in partnership with Celltrion Inc (068270.KQ) of South Korea and would therefore have to pay royalties on those products coming to market.""We don't think this is a major issue for the transaction,"" Read told analysts on a conference call.Boris said Pfizer would probably try to divest some of those assets to focus on its own wholly owned biosimilar candidates, including versions of Roche Holding AG's ROG.VX Herceptin for breast cancer, Rituxan lymphoma treatment and Avastin lung cancer drug, as well as of Abbott Laboratories Inc's (ABT.N) Humira arthritis treatment.The total value of the deal is about $17 billion, including debt, the companies said. Hospira had $1.75 billion in outstanding long-term debt as of Sept. 30, according to a regulatory filing.Pfizer's financial advisers are Guggenheim Securities, J.P. Morgan (JPM.N) and Lazard (LAZ.N), with Ropes & Gray LLP as legal adviser and Clifford Chance LLP advising on international regulatory matters.Morgan Stanley (MS.N) is Hospira's financial adviser, while Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP & Affiliates are its legal adviser.

482,"  (Adds details)By Andrew CallusPARIS Feb 20 Sanofi's new boss Olivier Brandicourt could earn up to 4.2 million euros ($4.8 million) a year at the drugs group and  pocket an extra 4 million euros within 12 months as a one-off golden handshake.The pay of the former medical doctor, due to take up his new role from April, was revealed in a statement from the company on Friday, a day after the 59-year-old Bayer executive was named as replacement for Chris Viehbacher, who was sacked in October. Brandicourt will get 1.2 million euros as a fixed sum, plus a performance-related amount targeted at 150 percent of that and capped at 250 percent.His fixed pay is slightly below Viehbacher's 1.26 million euro award for 2014, but at 250 percent against 200 percent, the variable portion makes his earnings potential higher. Brandicourt will also get 220,000 stock options and 45,000 performance shares a year in Sanofi, matching Viehbacher's award.He has a higher cash earnings potential than Patrick Pouyanne, who took over last October as CEO of oil group Total , which vies with Sanofi for status as France's largest company by stock market value. Pouyanne has the same fixed salary, but his variable pay is capped at 165 percent.Rival U.S. drug company Pfizer, similar in size by annual revenue, paid its chief executive Ian Read a $1.8 million  2013 salary plus an annual incentive award of $3.4 million for a total $5.2 million (4.6 million euros), with stock awards and stock options on top.Brandicourt's 4 million euro golden handshake, billed as compensation for loss of benefits at his former employer, is split into two parts: the first 2 million will be paid when he reports for work on April 2; the second will be paid in January 2016 ""subject to conditions of continued employment"".

483,"  * Approval of first U.S. biosimilar drug imminent* FDA set to decide on approval of Novartis' Zarxio* EU experience shows wide variation in biosimilar use* Tender, quota systems key to price and uptakeBy Ben Hirschler and Deena BeasleyLONDON/LOS ANGELES, March 6 A revolution is brewing in healthcare with lower-cost copies of complex biotech drugs finally set to reach the United States, nine years after so-called biosimilars were launched in Europe.The potential for copycats to take business from original biotech brands is grabbing investors' attention and was a key factor in Pfizer's recent move to buy injectable drugmaker Hospira for about $15 billion.The first approval for a biosimilar in the United States is expected imminently - Zarxio, Novartis' copy of Amgen's white blood cell-boosting product Neupogen.But Europe's experience shows the economics of biosimilars can be unpredictable.The conventional wisdom has been that such copycats, which are still far more difficult to make than standard chemical drugs, will sell at a modest discount of perhaps 20 to 30 percent to the original biotech brands.Yet when Norway's drug procurement agency held its latest national hospital tender in January for a biosimilar copy of Johnson & Johnson and Merck's Remicade it was offered a whopping 69 percent discount to the original brand.The decision to slash the price was made by Orion Pharma , which distributes the biosimilar known as Remsima in Norway for South Korea's Celltrion.Both Remsima and Remicade, which is forecast to be the world's second-biggest drug this year with sales of more than $9 billion, contain the antibody infliximab for rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease.Orion's move raises questions about the economics of biosimilars and the competitive threat they pose to originator companies - as well as the profit margins they offer to companies making them. An Orion spokeswoman said the deep discount reflected the ""tough pricing competition"" in the Nordic region.MEGABUCKS AT STAKE As an early adopter, Norway is a biosimilars test-bed and Remsima is particularly important as the first copy of an antibody drug, while Norway's tender system makes it especially price-sensitive.Norwegian doctors have cheered the low price, which frees up resources to treat more patients or pay for other newer medicines, such as cancer immunotherapy.""Our experience has been very good,"" said Jorgen Jahnsen, professor of medicine at the University of Oslo, who has treated around 80 patients with Remsima since January 2014 and believes it works just like Remicade.""Other countries may not achieve the same price reduction as in Norway but it can still be significant,"" he added. With a population of only 5 million, Norway is a minnow in the global pharmaceuticals marketplace.The megabucks are at stake in larger European nations like Germany, France and Britain, countries where Remsima was launched last month, and in the United States.Express Scripts, the biggest U.S. manager of pharmacy benefits, predicts competition to Remicade and 10 other big biotech drugs could save the United States $250 billion over the next decade.And Steve Miller, the firm's chief medical officer, reckons that's conservative, since discounts could be larger than the 30 percent his company has assumed, while new competitors could force originators to discount their prices.He sees biosimilars acting like conventional generic drugs in driving down costs and creating financial headroom for new medicines.Americans have been using standard generic drugs - exact copies of drugs with expired patents - for 30 years. But the regulatory pathway for biosimilars, which are made in living cells and can never be exact replicas of originals, was only established by healthcare reform in 2010. FDA DECISION The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is due to give its verdict by March 8 on Zarxio, made by Novartis' generics unit Sandoz. A green light is expected after it won unanimous backing from an FDA panel in January.The arrival of biosimilars threatens companies heavily reliant on biotech drugs, like AbbVie and Roche , and Citigroup predicts a transfer of at least $110 billion of value from innovator companies to copycat producers in the next decade.Some big pharma companies, like Pfizer and Amgen, are hedging their bets with plans to produce their own biosimilars.The big unknown is how quickly biosimilars will be adopted in clinical practice.Europe's experience suggests that take-up hinges on the stance of governments and insurers.A analysis published in October by consultancy IMS Health found biosimilar penetration in Europe ranged from 1 percent to 99 percent across different products and markets, depending on whether countries had prescription quotas for biosimilar drugs, tenders or other mechanisms to encourage use.Key U.S. unknowns include the FDA's stance on naming biosimilars on pharmacy lists, questions over the extrapolation of a drug's use to multiple diseases, and the extent to which states will allow any prescription switching.There are also legal challenges, with Amgen seeking an injunction to block the launch of Zarxio, while a crucial FDA panel to consider Remsima was recently postponed.""We hope that there is not a problem with the application,"" said Express Scripts' Miller. ""The sooner we can get these great new products to the marketplace, the sooner Americans can enjoy the same savings Europeans have been enjoying.""(Editing by Pravin Char)",2015-03-06,PFE,"Fri Mar 6, 2015 | 2:00am EST",INSIGHT-Copy me: Europe shows U.S. a path to cheaper biotech drugs,http://www.reuters.com//article/health-biosimilars-idUSL5N0W54GH20150306?type=companyNews

489,"   By Ben Hirschler | LONDON  LONDON Pfizer is seeking new vaccine opportunities across the age spectrum as it broadens its portfolio by delivering shots into the arms of adolescents and the elderly, as well as infants.Previously reliant on just one vaccine, the blockbuster Prevnar, the U.S. drugmaker is now expanding its product line-up through both in-house development and by shopping for assets in a consolidating sector.In December it closed a deal to buy Baxter International's portfolio of marketed vaccines in a $635 million deal that will help it reach a broader population.Susan Silbermann, head of Pfizer Vaccines, said she was open to more such acquisitions, although there were fewer assets for sale in vaccines than in pharmaceuticals, where a race for promising new drugs has triggered a deal-making frenzy.""We are an important growth engine for the company and there are lots of ways to grow. We will continue to grow with our current portfolio -- much of which is new anyway -- but if we have external opportunities that would be great,"" she said in an interview during a visit to London.""Having a broad portfolio helps us in terms of our positioning and presenting in front of healthcare professionals and governments."" For many years the vaccines industry has been dominated by five big companies, but that has shrunk to four with GlaxoSmithKline's purchase of Novartis' business. The other large players are Sanofi and Merck.CORNERSTONE PRODUCT  Prevnar, which protects against pneumococcal bacteria that can cause pneumonia and other infections, will remain Pfizer's cornerstone vaccine for the foreseeable future, with both a new 13-strain version of the shot and an older seven-strain one generating sales of $4.5 billion in 2014. That made it the group's second-biggest franchise.Pfizer is diversifying, however, by developing a pipeline of new vaccines, even as it extends the use of Prevnar 13 into the over-65s in a move expected to boost sales.A recently approved vaccine for meningitis B together with other vaccines in development point to growth possibilities. The new meningitis B vaccine will go head-to-head with Bexsero, a rival developed by Novartis and taken on by GSK. Pfizer also has high hopes for a second wave of vaccines beyond this, including experimental shots against Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium difficile, two potentially life-threatening infections often caught in hospital.Aside from infectious diseases, there is an intriguing anti-smoking vaccine designed to block the uptake of nicotine by the brain in early-stage clinical testing and another against allergic asthma. Both highlight a push into non-traditional adult markets.

490,"  (Adds cost details, Pfizer details)By Deena BeasleySan Diego, March 15 Studies of a new class of experimental cholesterol-lowering drugs signal that they can reduce by half the risk of heart attack and other major cardiovascular problems compared to standard treatment alone.Doctors at the annual meeting of the American College of Cardiology, where the studies were presented, called the results ""encouraging,"" but said larger, controlled trials are needed to fully understand the drugs, known as PCSK9 inhibitors.An analysis of about 4,500 patients who stayed on treatment for nearly a year after completing earlier trials of Amgen Inc's  Repatha, also known as evolocumab, found that 0.95 percent of those given the drug and standard therapy suffered a cardiovascular event, compared with 2.18 percent of the group on standard treatment, which ranged from diet changes to drugs such as statins.Amgen defined ""event"" as death, heart attack, stroke or ""mini-stroke,"" unstable chest pain or heart failure requiring hospitalization, or the need for a procedure to restore bloodflow to the heart.Side effects more frequent, but still rare, in patients treated with Repatha included neurocognitive problems, such as confusion, something the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has said should be monitored closely. Scott Wasserman, Amgen's head of cardiovascular and metabolic therapies, told Reuters that the company does not believe there is a safety issue.Neurocognitive side effects were also more common in the treatment arm of an 18-month, 2,300-patient trial of a rival PCSK9 drug being developed by Sanofi SA and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc.The drug, Praluent, was shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems from 3.3 percent for placebo patients to 1.7 percent for the treatment group. ""Events"" in this trial were defined only as death, heart attack, stroke and chest pain requiring hospitalization. ""Some of the endpoints in these trials are kind of soft, and they aren't prospective studies,"" said Dr. Anthony DeMaria, director of the cardiovascular center at the University of California San Diego who was not involved in the trials. ""It's encouraging that the larger trials are likely to succeed, but we still need those trials.""Dr Marc Sabatine, lead investigator of the Repatha study, said data for both drugs ""are very consistent ... it appears that cutting LDL by 61 percent translates to a roughly 50 percent reduction in cardiovascular events.""Numerous trials have shown that PCSK9 inhibitors significantly lower blood levels of ""bad"" LDL cholesterol, but investors expect widespread use will hinge on whether the drugs are proven to prevent death, heart attacks and other serious heart problems. The experimental drugs are antibodies, given by injection, designed to target the PCSK9 protein that maintains LDL cholesterol in the bloodstream. They work differently from statins - pills, now available as low-cost generics, that block the liver's production of LDL cholesterol in the first place.Both Amgen and Sanofi/Regeneron have filed for FDA approval of their drugs, based on trials showing that they lower LDL in patients whose cholesterol is not controlled by other drugs, those who cannot tolerate other drugs and people genetically predisposed to high cholesterol.The FDA is slated to decide on Amgen's application for Repatha by Aug. 27, while the regulatory deadline for Praluent, also known as alirocumab, is July 24.Health insurers are already bracing for the impact on drug spending. Express Scripts Holding Co, the largest manager of prescription drug plans for U.S. employers, projects an annual cost as high as $10,000 per patient for PCSK9 drugs, which it says could be used for 10 million Americans.Both Amgen and Sanofi/Regeneron do not expect definitive data on cardiovascular outcomes for their drugs until larger trials conclude in 2017. Pfizer Inc,, which has not yet filed for regulatory approval of its PCSK9 drug, said it expects outcomes data in a similar time frame.

Morgan acted as financial adviser   (Adds plan for additional investment, J.P. Morgan role)By Ben HirschlerLONDON, March 17 The world's first venture capital fund dedicated to finding new ways to prevent and treat dementia has raised more than $100 million with the backing of the British government and several of the world's leading drugmakers.The global Dementia Discovery Fund is unique in focusing on a single difficult to treat disorder and in bringing together industry and government. Drug companies involved include GlaxoSmithKline, Johnson & Johnson, Eli Lilly, Pfizer and Biogen Idec.The initiative, announced by Britain's health minister Jeremy Hunt at a meeting in Geneva on Tuesday, follows a Group of Eight (G8) nations conference in London in December 2013 that set a goal of finding a cure or effective treatment for Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia by 2025.GSK's head of research and development Patrick Vallance told Reuters the 2025 goal was ""hugely ambitious"" but that pooling resources through the new fund to back promising ideas from academic groups and small biotech firms would help to accelerate research. ""It's tough to crack but the science is moving,"" Vallance said. ""People are now beginning to look at subsets of dementia and the genetics of neurodegeneration, so there are real opportunities.""Venture capital funds are a common source of finance for high-risk, early-stage life science research, but the new fund is the first to focus solely on dementia.The British government, which has worked with J.P. Morgan  as financial adviser in setting up the fund, said that additional interested investors would have an opportunity to participate at a later stage. As well as providing financial support, research projects that secure the fund's backing will gain expert advice during the critical early stages of research, with charity Alzheimer's Research UK also involved alongside industry.Individual pharmaceutical companies wanting to go on to  develop particular projects commercially will be able to bid for rights to do so, with money raised from the bidding process to be reinvested in the fund.The British government, as project leader, is contributing $22 million, while GSK is putting in $25 million and J&J $10 million, with further money coming from other companies.Dementia, of which Alzheimer's is the most common form, affects close to 50 million people worldwide and is set to reach 135 million by 2050, according to non-profit campaign group Alzheimer's Disease International.There is still no treatment that can slow the progression of Alzheimer's.

492,"   By Ransdell Pierson  Pfizer Inc and Eli Lilly and Co will resume  late-stage studies of their drug tanezumab for chronic pain after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration lifted a partial hold on trials of it and similar medicines.Pfizer expects to receive a $200 million upfront payment from Lilly as a result of the development, the companies said on Monday.The FDA, in December 2012, restricted clinical studies of tanezumab and other pain drugs that work by blocking a protein called nerve growth factor (NGF), because of nervous-system side effects seen in animal studies conducted by other companies. But the agency allowed trials of the non-narcotic medicine against terminal cancer pain to continue.Pfizer and Lilly said they will now resume the chronic pain studies because the FDA, after reviewing positive nonclinical data on the nervous system responses to tanezumab, had lifted the partial hold. If tanezumab is approved, it could have sales of $100 million in 2020, Cowen and Co has forecast, which could grow further as the drug is approved for new pain conditions. Still, Tanezumab could face competition from anti-NGF drugs being developed by others, including a partnership of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc and Sanofi.Shares of Pfizer surged 2.9 percent to $35.23 in morning trading Monday. Eli Lilly was up 1.3 percent at $77.10.  Pfizer and Lilly agreed in 2013 to jointly develop and sell tanezumab for several pain-related conditions, with the companies equally sharing development expenses and future sales.Tanezumab had shown initial promise in relieving pain in the knee and lower back, but Pfizer in 2010 suspended large late-stage trials of the drug for those conditions due to reports that patients' osteoarthritis had worsened.The FDA, however, later recommended that the osteoarthritis trials continue if safeguards were put in place and patients did not simultaneously take other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. One of Pfizer's biggest products is Celebrex, another pain and arthritis drug, which had global sales last year of $2.7 billion. But its sales are expected to plunge this year, following the drug's loss of U.S. marketing exclusivity in December.

The China Food and Drug Administration regulatory agency could not immediately be reached for comment.The move comes as drugmakers face growing difficulties obtaining approvals for medicines in China, the world's No. 2 drug market, where pharmaceutical executives say over-stretched regulators have added more red tape to the process of bringing drugs to market.""Based on a careful assessment of this situation, we have decided to cease our vaccines commercial operations in China at this time, effective immediately,"" Pfizer spokeswoman Trupti Wagh said in comments emailed to Reuters. Prevenar is the only vaccine Pfizer sells in China, and the move doesn't affect its other operations in the country.Strong growth in China sales of drugs including Prevenar helped Pfizer offset weaker global revenue growth last year.Pfizer's vaccines sales team has around 200 staff and ""most colleagues will be impacted"", Wagh added. Pfizer has over 9,000 employees in China, according to its website, working in business segments including research and development, prescription drugs and consumer health products. China's fast-growing healthcare market is a magnet for global drugmakers, medical device firms and hospital operators, all keen to get a slice of a medical bill estimated to hit $1 trillion by 2020. Drug spending alone is set to hit $185 billion by 2018, according to IMS Health.However, China's drug approval backlog jumped a third last year, authorities said earlier this month, reflecting rising industry concern that it is getting harder to get medicines approved. Wagh said Pfizer would work with Chinese regulators to bring Prevenar 13 - an updated version of the vaccine - to market at some point in future, although she added there was no clear timeframe for this.Pfizer's global revenues from the Prevenar family of products, which includes Prevenar, was $4.5 billion last year, up 12 percent against 2013, the firm said in its annual report. This included ""strong operational growth"" in China.Prevenar is used to help prevent pneumococcal disease, a bacterial infection which can lead to illnesses such as pneumonia, meningitis and sepsis, according to the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases. It is the only vaccine approved to treat children under two years-old for the condition in China, Pfizer's Wagh said.The World Health Organization estimates there were around 14.5 million cases of serious pneumococcal disease in 2000, resulting in nearly 1 million deaths of young children.

In a filing Monday in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, Pfizer's lawyers - Sheila Birnbaum and Mark Cheffo of Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan - said the plaintiffs have ""long been on notice"" that they would need to find a new expert for the cases, and that it was ""outrageous"" they had not yet done so.

502,"   By Ransdell Pierson  Pfizer Inc said on Wednesday the first formal late-stage trial of its approved treatment for advanced breast cancer, Ibrance, was stopped early after the medicine met its goal of delaying progression of the disease in previously treated patients.J.P.Morgan analyst Chris Schott said in a research note that the successful trial results should boost demand for the recently approved treatment, which works differently than approved medicines and has blockbuster sales potential. Some analysts have predicted the drug could eventually generate annual sales of more than $5 billion.Pfizer said the Phase 3 study, called Paloma 3, was halted after an independent data monitoring board determined that Ibrance, also known as palbociclib, had proven its effectiveness among patients with advanced disease who had previously been treated with anti-estrogen drugs. Data from the study will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting, the largest U.S. drugmaker said.Patients taking Ibrance in combination with AstraZeneca Plc's Faslodex (fulvestrant), a widely used treatment to block estrogen, were deemed to have fared better in terms of disease progression than those taking Faslodex alone.The trial enrolled patients whose breast cancer was classified as estrogen-receptor positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (ER+/HER2-).  Ibrance was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in February for such patients, but only ones who had not previously been treated for advanced disease.The accelerated approval was based on results of a study that showed Ibrance delayed progression of disease significantly longer than Novartis AG's Femara(letrozole), a member of another class of breast cancer treatments called aromatase inhibitors.Pfizer is conducting a large trial called Paloma-2, which ithopes will confirm the benefits of Ibrance as a first-line treatment, in combination with Femara. Ibrance works by blocking two enzymes, cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6, that are involved in cell growth.A number of other drugmakers, including Eli Lilly and Co, are testing drugs that block the same or similar enzymes, as potential treatments for various cancers.

506,"   By Jessica Dye  Pfizer Inc scored a key victory Friday when it was cleared of liability in the first U.S. trial involving claims that its antidepressant Zoloft can cause birth defects in children born to women who take the drug while pregnant. Plaintiff Kristyn Pesante claimed that Pfizer failed to warn that using Zoloft during pregnancy could cause birth defects and sought damages after her son was born with a rare, serious congenital heart problem. Following a week-long trial in St. Louis, Missouri, jurors deliberated briefly before clearing Pfizer of liability, according to a Pfizer spokeswoman Neha Wadhwa. Pesante had sought both compensatory and punitive damages, accusing Pfizer of downplaying Zoloft's risks in order to boost sales. Hundreds of lawsuits saying Zoloft can lead to cardiac and other birth defects have been filed in U.S. state and federal courts. While not binding on the other cases, Friday's verdict is ""particularly significant"" because Pesante's was the first case selected by plaintiffs for trial and featured much of the same medical evidence and theories underpinning other cases across the country, Wadhwa said.  Pesante's 2012 lawsuit said that Pfizer touted Zoloft as a treatment for depression in pregnant women that had a lower risk of side effects than similar drugs. She said she took the drug during her first trimester and was not aware at the time of the risks. But Pfizer has disputed any scientific link between Zoloft and birth defects and said that its position is supported by individual medical groups including the American Heart Association, American Psychiatric Association and American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. A lawyer for plaintiffs did not immediately return requests for comment. Approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Zoloft is part of a widely prescribed group of antidepressants known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs.  In 2010, GlaxoSmithKline Plc paid an undisclosed amount of money to settle some U.S. lawsuits linking another SSRI, Paxil, to birth defects. The next Zoloft trial is scheduled to take place later this year in state court in Philadelphia.

509,"   By Ransdell Pierson  A large study of Bristol-Myers Squibb Co's Opdivo treatment has been halted after proving the drug is effective against the most common form of lung cancer, the company said, positioning the medicine for far wider use than its already approved lung cancer and melanoma indications.The U.S. drugmaker on Friday said the study, called Checkmate-057, was stopped early after an independent data monitoring committee concluded that Opdivo provided a survival advantage over docetaxel, a standard chemotherapy, among patients with previously treated non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).The so-called PD-1 inhibitor, which works by taking the brakes off the immune system, was approved by U.S. regulators last month to treat the less-common ""squamous"" form of NSCLC that had spread following treatment with chemotherapy. Opdivo is also approved for use against metastatic melanoma following treatment with Yervoy, another Bristol-Myers immuno-therapy. Opdivo, whose chemical name is nivolumab, competes with Merck & Co's Keytruda, a PD-1 inhibitor that is approved to treat melanoma and which is also being tested against NSCLC. Merck, which aims by midyear to seek U.S. approval of Keytruda for both squamous and non-squamous NSCLC, must now contemplate the likelihood of Bristol-Myers eventually competing in both arenas.     The rival drugs are also in trials against a variety of other cancers. AstraZeneca Plc, Pfizer Inc and other drugmakers are developing their own PD-1 inhibitors, or similar drugs known as PD-L1 inhibitors. Wall Street expects the products to generate combined annual sales of more than $30 billion by 2025, with lung cancer seen as the most lucrative potential use.Data from several trials of the promising new family of cancer drugs is slated to be released over the coming week at the annual meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) in Philadelphia. Sanford Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson on Friday said Wall Street is expecting Opdivo to be the market leader among the PD-1 inhibitors, with peak annual sales of $7 billion by 2020. But he recommended that investors buy shares in ""multiple players in the immuno-oncology category.""He said in a research note, ""Because of the size of the I/O opportunity, in our view there will be more than one way to win.""Bristol-Myers shares rose 2.9 percent to $65.55 in midday trading, while Merck shares retreated 1.3 percent to $57.07, also on the New York Stock Exchange.

515,"   By Olivia Oran, Ben Hirschler and Pamela Barbaglia | NEW YORK/LONDON  NEW YORK/LONDON Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) is the mystery bidder for Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB (SOBIV.ST), the rare disease specialist which disclosed this week that a potential buyer had made a preliminary offer, people with knowledge of the situation said.    The Swedish company, known as Sobi, has a market value of 35.8 billion Swedish crowns ($4.3 billion). Its medicines for rare or ""orphan"" conditions make it a target in a consolidating sector in which large, cash-rich drugmakers seek to bolster their portfolios with offerings from smaller biotech firms.    Sobi did not identify its potential acquirer when it revealed on Monday that it had received an approach, but Biogen (BIIB.O) and Pfizer (PFE.N) were viewed by analysts as the most likely bidders, as they already have partnership deals with Sobi.The sources asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential. The price that Pfizer has offered could not be learned. Spokesmen for both Sobi and Pfizer  declined to comment.  Pfizer Chief Executive Ian Read said on Tuesday during an earnings call that he was open to deals and was ""agnostic"" about the size of acquisitions.    Read added that current valuations in the biotech sector were ""buoyant"", meaning Pfizer's business development team would be very careful as it evaluated opportunities. Sobi manufacturers a hemophilia treatment called ReFactor AF, which Pfizer sells. On Wednesday, Sobi postponed its annual shareholder meeting, which was scheduled for May 6, in the wake of the takeover proposal.     Pfizer has actively been looking at takeover targets after an attempt to buy AstraZeneca Plc (AZN.L) failed last year. The company agreed to acquire Hospira Inc for $15 billion in February.      Pfizer has established a Rare Disease Research Unit since it sees drugs for rare diseases, which can command very high prices, as an important opportunity in its mix of businesses.Recent deals involving rare disease companies include Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Inc's (TEVA.TA) acquisition of Auspex Pharmaceuticals for $3.5 billion in March, Shire Plc's (SHP.L) acquisition of NPS Pharmaceuticals for $5.2 billion in January and BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc's (BMRN.O) acquisition of Prosensa Holding NV for $840 million last November.

518,"  (Changes ""sexual preference"" to ""orientation,"" adds new third graph on voter registration drive, omits word ""store"" in phrase ""store associates"")By Michelle Conlin and Lucas Iberico LozadaNEW YORK May 11 It wasn't long ago that politics, like religious affiliation or sexual orientation, was a taboo topic in the American workplace. Political beliefs were considered a private affair - off limits to the boss.But today employers are increasingly approaching workers to fundraise, lobby and campaign in ways they never have before, according to a Reuters analysis of FEC filings and data compiled by the Business Industry Political Action Committee. The Washington trade group, which has offices across the street from the White House, helps firms such as Wal-Mart, Halliburton and Lockheed Martin mobilize employees on policy issues important to the companies.BIPAC is working with top U.S. companies on a massive employee voter registration drive in September in preparation for the 2016 Presidential election.For years it was unions and trade associations that were the politically powerful workplace players, operating political action committees (PACs) that raised millions of dollars to support their preferred candidates. But since a 2010 U.S. Supreme Court decision that allowed for unlimited political spending by corporations, the number of companies engaged in this sort of activity - be it nudging employees to write letters, donate, campaign or vote - has risen 45 percent to 7,317, according to BIPAC's internal research, seen by Reuters.The new approach to workplace giving is called ""E2E,"" or employer-to-employee outreach. These PACs donate to both Democrats and Republicans, depending upon who supports policies and issues favorable to the business interests of the corporation.""When you compare the amount of money the Wal-Marts and McDonald's and their employees have, compared to even the largest American unions, it's peanuts and watermelons,"" said Phil Smith, spokesman for the United Mine Workers of America.Employees at the nation's top firms are contributing more money than ever before to company PACs controlled by CEOs and senior management, according to April 2015 quarterly fundraising and spending documents disclosed to the U.S. election regulator, the Federal Election Commission.An analysis of FEC filings of 122 of the top company PACs shows employees raised a median 25 percent more in the first quarter of 2015 versus the same period four years ago. For the PACs analyzed, the median amount of contributions collected was $130,842.PARKING SPACE INCENTIVES To encourage this sort of donation, some companies are attaching perks to the giving.BP, for example, says employees who donate at least 2.5 percent of their salary to the company PAC get choice parking spots in the company lot. At Wal-Mart, the company gives employees who donate to the company PAC a two-for-one match to Wal-Mart's in-house charity for associates in need. A BP spokesman said federal law permitted ""recognition gifts"" such as preferred parking. Wal-Mart said it only asks salaried employees to give, not hourly ones, and that workers are free to stipulate whether their contributions go to Democratic or Republican candidates.At companies that depend heavily on government contracts, the giving is especially high. For example, employees of Honeywell International, a major manufacturer of aircraft electronics, gave more than $1 million in the first quarter of 2015 - up 52 percent since the same period in 2011.Honeywell, along with Lockheed Martin, BP and Halliburton, says its employee contributions are 100 percent voluntary and legal and that no pressure is put on employees to become more politically active.""Honeywell's PAC supports those who support policies that are good for our business and help to create jobs in the United States,"" company spokesman Rob Ferris said.EMPLOYEES' DONATIONS SOARING This sharp increase in political donations by employees is fueling concerns among some campaign finance watchdogs, ahead of the November 2016 elections, that workers may feel pressure to donate to candidates they do not support or to lobby on issues they don't agree with. ""What I worry about is the inherently coercive nature of these workplace situations,"" Democratic FEC Commissioner Ellen Weintraub said.""Let's say an employer decides to throw corporate resources behind a candidate and sets up a phone bank, asking employees to get on the phone to get people to support candidate Jones. It's very hard to say no to your employer. It puts the employee, especially the low-level employee, in a very difficult position.""Weintraub and FEC Chairwoman Ann Ravel, also a Democrat, said they were not allowed to comment on any cases before the commission that may be related to this issue.The top Republican on the FEC, Lee Goodman, did not echo his Democratic colleagues' concerns and noted in an email that the law prohibits employers from coercing employees to make political contributions.Supporters of the employer-to-employee outreach say that it performs an important civic function by educating workers and turning them into active political participants. BIPAC says its research shows that many workers rate their employers as more credible information sources about politics than political parties, labor unions or the news media.""If it's done right, there's nothing illegal about it,"" said Greg Casey, president of BIPAC. Some 89 percent of the candidates its PAC supports are Republicans. PFIZER EMPLOYEES' EMAIL BLAST The practice drew mixed reviews among a dozen employees at five companies interviewed by Reuters.""The legislators that would support the company are absolutely the ones I would never support,"" said one global director at Pfizer who spoke on condition of anonymity.An email sent to staff in April noted that Pfizer's employees had sent more than 8,000 emails to politicians about healthcare and patent legislation favorable to Pfizer.The Chairwoman of Pfizer's employee PAC, Sally Susman, said that, ""while strictly voluntary, we encourage colleagues to raise voices on behalf of the patients we serve on important issues.""Some companies go further. Before the 2012 presidential election, Koch Industries sent its employees a voter packet informing them which candidates, including Republican nominee Mitt Romney, the company supported, as well as an editorial knocking President Barack Obama. Campaign finance reformers said at the time that Koch's actions crossed the line, while Koch Industries defended its actions as ""nothing unusual"" and the type of thing unions did all the time.Some employees allege they have suffered retribution as a result of not supporting a CEO's politics.At Ohio-based Murray Energy, a coal mining company, plant shift forewoman Jean Cochenour said in a 2014 lawsuit that she was fired in retribution for not responding to letters she received from the company's CEO, Robert Murray, that began: ""Dear Jean: The coal industry and our jobs are being destroyed by President Barack Obama. Our only hope to stop them is by electing friends of coal.""The letters, samples of which were included in the pending lawsuit, identified the Republican candidates employees should donate to, and vote for, like New Hampshire Senate hopeful Scott Brown. Murray requested employees make a $200 donation to each candidate and included a self-addressed envelope for the donations, according to court documents.Cochenour also alleged that managers were required to donate at least 1 percent of their salaries to Murray's candidates. And vendors and suppliers were also required to give - lest they lose the company's business.In an emailed response to these allegations, Murray Energy spokesperson Gary Broadbent said Robert Murray never knows who gives to his personal fundraisers. He called Cochenour's statements ""blatantly false and totally concocted.""There are, of course, limits to what money can buy. Of the four Senate candidates Murray asked employees to support in the 2014 mid-term election, all lost.

520,"   By Michelle Conlin and Lucas Iberico Lozada | NEW YORK  NEW YORK May 11 It wasn't long ago that politics, like religious orientation or sexual preference, was a taboo topic in the American workplace. Political beliefs were considered a private affair - off limits to the boss.But today employers are increasingly approaching workers to fundraise, lobby and campaign in ways they never have before, according to a Reuters analysis of FEC filings and data compiled by the Business Industry Political Action Committee. The Washington trade group, which has offices across the street from the White House, helps firms such as Wal-Mart, Halliburton and Lockheed Martin mobilize employees on policy issues important to the companies.For years it was unions and trade associations that were the politically powerful workplace players, operating political action committees (PACs) that raised millions of dollars to support their preferred candidates. But since a 2010 U.S. Supreme Court decision that allowed for unlimited political spending by corporations, the number of companies engaged in this sort of activity - be it nudging employees to write letters, donate, campaign or vote - has risen 45 percent to 7,317, according to BIPAC's internal research, seen by Reuters.The new approach to workplace giving is called ""E2E,"" or employer-to-employee outreach. These PACs donate to both Democrats and Republicans, depending upon who supports policies and issues favorable to the business interests of the corporation.""When you compare the amount of money the Wal-Marts and McDonald's and their employees have, compared to even the largest American unions, it's peanuts and watermelons,"" said Phil Smith, spokesman for the United Mine Workers of America.Employees at the nation's top firms are contributing more money than ever before to company PACs controlled by CEOs and senior management, according to April 2015 quarterly fundraising and spending documents disclosed to the U.S. election regulator, the Federal Election Commission.An analysis of FEC filings of 122 of the top company PACs shows employees raised a median 25 percent more in the first quarter of 2015 versus the same period four years ago. For the PACs analyzed, the median amount of contributions collected was $130,842.PARKING SPACE INCENTIVES To encourage this sort of donation, some companies are attaching perks to the giving.BP, for example, says employees who donate at least 2.5 percent of their salary to the company PAC get choice parking spots in the company lot. At Wal-Mart, the company gives employees who donate to the company PAC a two-for-one match to Wal-Mart's in-house charity for store associates in need.A BP spokesman said federal law permitted ""recognition gifts"" such as preferred parking. Wal-Mart said it only asks salaried employees to give, not hourly ones, and that workers are free to stipulate whether their contributions go to Democratic or Republican candidates. At companies that depend heavily on government contracts, the giving is especially high. For example, employees of Honeywell International, a major manufacturer of aircraft electronics, gave more than $1 million in the first quarter of 2015 - up 52 percent since the same period in 2011.Honeywell, along with Lockheed Martin, BP and Halliburton, says its employee contributions are 100 percent voluntary and legal and that no pressure is put on employees to become more politically active.""Honeywell's PAC supports those who support policies that are good for our business and help to create jobs in the United States,"" company spokesman Rob Ferris said.EMPLOYEES' DONATIONS SOARING This sharp increase in political donations by employees is fueling concerns among some campaign finance watchdogs, ahead of the November 2016 elections, that workers may feel pressure to donate to candidates they don't support or to lobby on issues they don't agree with.""What I worry about is the inherently coercive nature of these workplace situations,"" Democratic FEC Commissioner Ellen Weintraub said. ""Let's say an employer decides to throw corporate resources behind a candidate and sets up a phone bank, asking employees to get on the phone to get people to support candidate Jones. It's very hard to say no to your employer. It puts the employee, especially the low-level employee, in a very difficult position.""Weintraub and FEC Chairwoman Ann Ravel, also a Democrat, said they were not allowed to comment on any cases before the commission that may be related to this issue.The top Republican on the FEC, Lee Goodman, did not echo his Democratic colleagues' concerns and noted in an email that the law prohibits employers from coercing employees to make political contributions.Supporters of the employer-to-employee outreach say that it performs an important civic function by educating workers and turning them into active political participants. BIPAC says its research shows that many workers rate their employers as more credible information sources about politics than political parties, labor unions or the news media.""If it's done right, there's nothing illegal about it,"" said Greg Casey, president of BIPAC. Some 89 percent of the candidates its PAC supports are Republicans.

521,"  May 11 Mylan NV's Chairman Robert Coury said he may sweeten the company's offer for Perrigo Co Plc  by adding terms that will reduce risk to Perrigo's shareholders, sources told Bloomberg on Monday.People familiar with the matter said that Coury laid out scenarios that could play out in the future and had even suggested that a Mylan-Perrigo combination could be an attractive target for Pfizer Inc, Bloomberg said.       (bloom.bg/1PD2z1S)This comes after Reuters reported comments from Coury last week on how Mylan would consider buying Israeli pharma firm Teva Pharmaceutical Industries down the line. Mylan is attempting to buy over-the-counter drugmaker Perrigo for $34 billion in an unsolicited offer that is expected to turn into a hostile one. Teva, meanwhile, made an unsolicited $40 billion bid for Mylan last month, which the latter rejected. Teva said last week it will move ahead with its plans to acquire Mylan if the Perrigo deal is not completed. At the meetings, Coury also brought up the idea that Mylan could make a deal with Novartis AG's generic business unit, Sandoz, people told Bloomberg.Mylan and Novartis could not be reached outside of regular business hours.

522,"   By Deena Beasley  A drug being developed by Roche Holding AG was shown in pivotal trials to shrink tumors in patients with advanced lung cancer with a specific gene mutation who had stopped responding to crizotinib, another drug in the same class.Currently, Pfizer Inc's crizotinib, or Xalkori, is approved for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer with a mutation of the ALK gene. The mutation is found in about 4 percent of NSCLC cases. Roche's alectinib is an oral ALK inhibitor, which the company says is able to cross the blood-brain barrier - an important benefit for lung cancer, which often spreads to the brain. The company said that in one trial, 50 percent of patients responded to the drug, while the response rate was 47.8 percent in the second trial.In addition, alectinib was shown to shrink tumors in people whose cancer had spread to the central nervous system. People whose tumors shrank in response to alectinib continued to respond for a median of 11.2 and 7.5 months, respectively, in the two studies. Results from both studies were released on Wednesday ahead of the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology later this month. The most common side effects of alectinib were an increase in muscle enzymes, increased liver enzymes and shortness of breath. Sandra Horning, chief medical officer at Roche's Genentech unit, said Roche plans to submit the trial results to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration this year. The company is also conducting a head-to-head study of alectinib compared with crizotinib.

526,"  (Adds details, background on symptoms, trial results, paragraphs 3-6)By Toni ClarkeWASHINGTON May 28 The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Thursday approved the first drug to treat a rare, progressive lung disease that mainly affects women of childbearing age. The drug, Rapamune, known chemically as sirolimus, is made by Pfizer Inc and is designed to treat lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), a disease that causes lung damage and affects only two to five women per million worldwide.Symptoms of the disease are similar to those of other lung conditions such as asthma, emphysema and bronchitis, according to the LAM Foundation. The drug was originally approved in 1999 to help prevent organ rejection in patients receiving kidney transplants. It was reviewed under the FDA's ""breakthrough therapy"" program, which helps speed products for unmet needs through the development and regulatory process. In patients with LAM, abnormal growth of smooth muscle cells invade lung tissues, making it hard to breathe and limiting the supply of oxygen to the body. The cells are not cancerous but do grow uncontrollably in the lungs causing the airways, blood and lymph vessels to become obstructed.A clinical trial of 89 patients over 12 months showed patients taking Rapamune had a slower decline in lung function than those taking a placebo. After the drug was stopped, the decline in lung function resumed at the same rate as the placebo group, the FDA said.

529,"   By Deena Beasley | CHICAGO  CHICAGO A Phase III trial of Pfizer Inc's Ibrance showed that, in combination with hormone therapy, the drug more than doubled the duration of disease control for women with the most common type of breast cancer.At the time of an interim analysis, patients given Ibrance and AstraZeneca Plc's Faslodex (fulvestrant), a widely used treatment to block estrogen, lived an average of 9.2 months before their cancer worsened. This compared with 3.8 months for patients treated with Faslodex and a placebo.The trial, presented in Chicago at a meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, enrolled 521 patients whose breast cancer was classified as estrogen-receptor positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative. This category accounts for about 75 percent of all breast cancers. Ibrance, or palbociclib, was given conditional approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in February for such patients, but only those who had not previously been treated for advanced breast cancer. ""This represents a new standard of care option ... we await follow-up for overall survival,"" said Dr. Don Dizon, a gynecologic oncologist at the Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center in Boston and an ASCO spokesperson.Ibrance works by blocking two enzymes, cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6, that are involved in cell growth. Some Wall Street analysts have predicted the drug could eventually generate annual sales of more than $5 billion. Pfizer announced in April that the pivotal trial was stopped early after meeting its goal of demonstrating that Ibrance delayed disease progression. Overall survival results are not yet available, said Dr. Nicholas Turner, a consultant medical oncologist at The Royal Marsden and a team leader at The Institute of Cancer Research in London, and the study's lead author.The most common adverse side effects seen in the trial involved blood count irregularities, but the number of infections caused by the irregularities was low and similar for both arms of the trial, Dr Turner said. The trial showed that 2.6 percent of Ibrance patients stopped treatment due to side effects. Pfizer is currently conducting a study of Ibrance in women with advanced breast cancer not previously treated with hormone therapy.

But the head of healthcare at Germany's Merck KGaA, Belen Garijo, said its rival drug avelumab was well on track to play a role in the market.""We are now in the race,"" she told Reuters. The development of avelumab is most advanced in lung cancer, where it has reached the third and last phase of testing on humans required for regulatory approval. It is in the second phase in Merkel cell carcinoma, a type of skin cancer, and in the first stage in seven other cancer types. ""There are indications where we believe we can be part of the first two or first three immunotherapies, like ovarian, gastric, head and neck, bladder and renal cancer, for example,"" said Garijo.Avelumab has the potential to come to market as early as 2017, she added.

Robinson's lawyer did not immediately return a request for comment.The Robinson case is the second trial involving Zoloft birth defects. In April, a jury in St. Louis, Missouri, cleared Pfizer of liability in a similar lawsuit. While the results of these  trials are not binding on other lawsuits, the verdicts can help influence settlement negotiations and show the strengths and weaknesses of each side's evidence and expert testimony. Hundreds of lawsuits have been filed against Pfizer in U.S. state and federal courts accusing the company of downplaying the birth-defect risks of the popular antidepressant in order to boost sales.Pfizer has denied that it acted improperly and said that a number of major medical groups, including the American Heart Association and American Psychiatric Association, have supported its position. Zoloft is part of a widely prescribed group of antidepressants known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs. In 2006, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration warned there could be an increased risk of certain birth defects in children whose mothers took the drugs while pregnant.After further review, the FDA in 2011 said it was premature to attribute SSRI use to birth defects and advised doctors not to change their prescribing practices for treating depression during pregnancy.In 2010, GlaxoSmithKline Plc paid an undisclosed sum to settle some U.S. lawsuits linking another SSRI, Paxil, to birth defects.The case is Robinson v.

540,"  Canada-based drugmaker Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc (VRX.TO) (VRX.N) has approached to buy Zoetis Inc (ZTS.N), an animal-health company, the Wall Street Journal reported.Shares of Zoetis, whose pipeline includes medicines and vaccines for pets and livestock, were up 2 percent at $56.65 in extended trading. The company, spun off from Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) in 2013, was valued at $24.85 billion as of Thursday's close, according to Thomson Reuters data.Both Valeant and Zoetis spokesperson declined to comment. It was not clear what Zoetis's reaction to the preliminary approach was, if any, or whether it was open to a sale, the Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter. (on.wsj.com/1fGK2qC)Zoetis, the world's largest animal-health company, has been cutting costs and said last month it planned to cut up to a quarter of its workforce and exit nearly 40 percent of its manufacturing plants. The decision came a month after Bill Ackman's Pershing Square, Zoetis's biggest shareholder, and Sachem Head Group seated their second nominee on the company's 11-member board in exchange for not soliciting takeover offers.Valeant, which lost a bid to buy Botox maker Allergan Inc (AGN.N) in November, is often criticized for a growth plan that is driven by acquisitions and cost-cutting. Shares of Laval, Quebec-based Valeant closed at C$287.79 on the Toronto Stock Exchange, after rising 73 percent this year; while Zoetis shares closed at $55.38 on the NYSE on Thursday.

541,"   By Jessica Dye  Pfizer Inc is seeking to strike a major blow to litigation over its antidepressant Zoloft by asking a federal judge, for a second time, to disqualify a key expert witness that plaintiffs say can show the drug causes birth defects. Starting Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Cynthia Rufe in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania will hear Pfizer's latest challenge to plaintiffs' proffered expert in multidistrict litigation over whether Zoloft can cause birth defects in children born to women who took the drug while pregnant. It will be plaintiffs' second, and possibly final, chance to convince Rufe to admit their expert testimony on general causation in humans, after Pfizer persuaded the judge last year to exclude key expert testimony.

550,"  July 27 Eli Lilly and Co on Monday said it would continue a large study of its high-profile experimental drug to raise ""good"" HDL cholesterol and lower ""bad"" LDL cholesterol, acting on the recommendation of a data monitoring committee.The independent panel of scientific advisors made its recommendation after taking an interim look at data from the Phase III study of the medicine, called evacetrapib, and assessing whether the trial had potential of attaining its primary goals, Lilly said. Such reviews are called futility analyses.Lilly said it expects to complete the 12,095-patient study, called ACCELERATE, in 2016. Evacetrapib is meant to sharply raise HDL cholesterol, while lowering LDL cholesterol, and thereby reduce the risk of heart attack, stroke and other cardiovascular problems. If it is approved and successful, the drug could capture blockbuster sales, industry experts believe. A similar treatment from Pfizer Inc called torcetrapib was scrapped in 2006 after safety problems arose, including deaths associated with the medicine. Pfizer had hoped its drug would capture annual sales of $10 billion and transform treatment of patients with heart disease. The failure of torcetrapib has dampened some of the earlier excitement about such drugs, which work by blocking a protein called CETP. But the potentially better apparent safety of Lilly's drug has kept its drug on investor radar screens.(Reporting by Ransdell Pierson; Editing by Alden Bentley)",2015-07-27,PFE,"Mon Jul 27, 2015 | 9:06am EDT","Lilly continues test of HDL cholesterol drug, on panel's advice",http://www.reuters.com//article/eli-lilly-cholesterol-idUSL1N1070MI20150727?type=companyNews

559,"   By Ben Hirschler | LONDON  LONDON Britain's competition watchdog has accused Pfizer and Flynn Pharma of breaching UK and European law by ramping up the cost of an epilepsy drug, given to more than 50,000 British patients, by as much as 2,600 percent.The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said its provisional view was that Pfizer and Flynn Pharma each abused a dominant position by charging ""excessive and unfair"" prices for phenytoin sodium capsules.Pfizer and Flynn said they were cooperating fully with the CMA and noted a final decision on any infringement of the law had not yet been made.The CMA can fine companies up to 10 percent of annual worldwide sales if they are found to have breached competition law.  U.S.-based Pfizer, which was in politicians' crosshairs last year after trying to buy British rival AstraZeneca, manufactures the drug and Flynn distributes it.The U.S. group used to market the medicine itself, under the brand name Epanutin, but sold the rights to Flynn in September 2012, since when the price has surged.Pfizer said in a statement the drug had been loss-making and it was therefore forced to consider whether it could continue supplying it at all. The CMA said Pfizer sold the drug at between 8 and 17 times its historic price to Flynn, which then sold it on at between 25 to 27 times more than the prices previously charged by Pfizer.As a result, the state-run National Health Service (NHS), which used to spend around 2.3 million pounds ($3.6 million) on phenytoin sodium capsules annually, saw its bill jump to more than 50 million pounds in 2013 and more than 40 million in 2014. “While businesses are generally free to set prices as they see fit, those that hold a dominant position have a special responsibility to ensure that their conduct does not impair genuine competition and that their prices are not excessive and unfair,"" said Ann Pope, the CMA's senior director of antitrust enforcement.“The prices that the CMA is concerned about in this case are very high compared to those prices previously charged and have led to a big increase in the total NHS drug bill, for what is a very important drug for tens of thousands of patients.”Pfizer said selling the medicine to Flynn had made it profitable and ensured there would be a sustainable supply, which was of ""paramount importance.""David Fakes, a director at Flynn, based in Stevenage near London, said his company would defend itself vigorously against the allegations, adding its product was priced competitively against rivals, including a tablet version of phenytoin.The CMA said it would consider any representations from the two companies before deciding whether the law had been infringed.",2015-08-06,PFE,"Thu Aug 6, 2015 | 10:47am EDT",Britain raps Pfizer over huge jump in epilepsy drug price,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-pfizer-britain-epilepsy-idUSKCN0QB0JV20150806?type=companyNews

Shares in Shire and Baxalta both rose on Monday, helped by a bullish note from Cowen analyst Ken Cacciatore, who said a takeover did not preclude an eventual acquisition of the enlarged group by a potential suitor like Pfizer.Shire, which took the market by surprise with its move to forge the world's leading rare diseases company by buying Baxalta, also needs to reassure its own investors.Joe Walters, senior portfolio manager at Royal London Asset Management, a top 20 investor in Shire, said buying Baxalta was riskier than its previous smaller deals but he was ready to see a bump in the all-share offer, which was worth $45.23 a share at Aug. 3 market prices.""Around the $50 mark is what it seems management would have to up their offer to, and I think shareholders would be comfortable, or at least mildly comfortable, at that level,"" he told Reuters. ""But I think they would start to get a little nervous if the offer went much above that price."" Rudi Van den Eynde, head of thematic global equity at European investment firm Candriam, which has exposure to both companies, was more cautious and described the proposed transaction as ""somewhat negative"".""We would have preferred a deal around a new, promising investigational drug instead of this major deal that comes close to empire building,"" he said.

In this environment, given our prospects and our outlook, Shire's offer is not compelling.""If Shire were to sweeten the offer, however, it might be open to negotiations, said one person familiar with the U.S. company.Share price fluctuations since Aug. 3 mean Shire's offer is currently worth around $42.50.($1 = 0.9139 euros)   (Additional reporting by Nishant Kumar and Greg Roumeliotis; Editing by Jane Merriman)",2015-08-10,PFE,"Mon Aug 10, 2015 | 3:34pm EDT",UPDATE 1-Shire steps up drive to get Baxalta talking after $30 bln bid,http://www.reuters.com//article/baxalta-ma-shire-idUSL5N10L3XS20150810?type=companyNews

Technology firm Apple was holding $181.1 billion offshore, more than any other U.S. company, and would owe an estimated $59.2 billion in U.S. taxes if it tried to bring the money back to the United States from its three overseas tax havens, the study said.The conglomerate General Electric has booked $119 billion offshore in 18 tax havens, software firm Microsoft  is holding $108.3 billion in five tax haven subsidiaries and drug company Pfizer is holding $74 billion in 151 subsidiaries, the study said. ""At least 358 companies, nearly 72 percent of the Fortune 500, operate subsidiaries in tax haven jurisdictions as of the end of 2014,"" the study said. ""All told these 358 companies maintain at least 7,622 tax haven subsidiaries.""Fortune 500 companies hold more than $2.1 trillion in accumulated profits offshore to avoid taxes, with just 30 of the firms accounting for $1.4 trillion of that amount, or 65 percent, the study found. Fifty-seven of the companies disclosed that they would expect to pay a combined $184.4 billion in additional U.S. taxes if their profits were not held offshore. Their filings indicated they were paying about 6 percent in taxes overseas, compared to a 35 percent U.S. corporate tax rate, it said.""Congress can and should take strong action to prevent corporations from using offshore tax havens, which in turn would restore basic fairness to the tax system, reduce the deficit and improve the functioning of markets,"" the study concluded.(Reporting by David Alexander; Editing by Eric Beech)",2015-10-06,PFE,"Tue Oct 6, 2015 | 3:15pm EDT",REFILE-Big U.S. firms hold $2.1 trillion overseas to avoid taxes -study,http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-tax-offshore-idUSL1N12600Q20151006?type=companyNews
574,"   By Aditya Kalra and Paritosh Bansal | NEW DELHI  NEW DELHI Indian regulators are privately pressuring major drug firms to better police how they sell popular codeine-based cough syrups to tackle smuggling and addiction, a move that is reducing supplies of a medicine doctors say is an effective treatment.  India's Cipla stopped making the product last year owing to regulatory demands, and U.S.-based Abbott Laboratories and Pfizer have had to reduce batch sizes by up to half, cutting how much medicine their factories can produce. But they are pushing back against other demands, a Reuters review of correspondence between companies and regulators showed, including selling one batch to only one buyer and printing labels that specify where the drug would be sold.Regulators want to make it easier for law enforcement agencies to track cough syrup abuse in the country and bottles smuggled to neighboring Bangladesh, where it was banned in the 1980s but is still sought by addicts.Retailers worried about liability from potential abuse by people addicted to the opiate codeine are in some cases refusing to stock the cough syrup, said J.S. Shinde, president of pharmaceutical lobby group All India Organization of Chemists and Druggists.   Sales of the drug in India fell 4 percent to 121 million bottles in the year through August, and 15 percent in the year before, according to IMS Health, a healthcare statistics provider. For drug regulators, the challenge is to strike a balance.   ""Any non-therapeutic usage is a concern, but you have to weigh the risks versus benefits,"" said an official at the federal drugs controller in New Delhi.  RISING COSTS  According to an industry executive, the likes of Pfizer and Abbott, who control most of the $103 million market for the drug, face a ""significant"" increase in costs as plants run well below capacity because of changes demanded of them.    And the regulatory regime could get tougher.   According to minutes of a July meeting of state and federal drug regulators, there was a recommendation to ban the sale of the syrup altogether because of ""rampant misuse and its illegal exports to neighboring countries.""  ""A large number of regulators were in favor of strict control,"" said Akun Sabharwal, drugs controller for southern Telangana state, who attended the meeting. The federal drugs official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said an outright ban would not be easy to impose, given the medicine's importance. Abbott estimates roughly 60 million people suffer from regular dry cough in India. Pfizer's India unit said in a statement the company takes all steps to maintain the highest standards of regulatory compliance, including supply-chain audits.  Abbott India said they believed existing Indian drug laws were adequate to control the abuse and the company had taken steps to support enforcement agencies.RUINED LIVES   Last year, the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB) billed the abuse of medicines containing narcotics and their smuggling from India among the ""greatest drug-related challenges"" facing South Asia. About 83,000 bottles of codeine-based cough syrups were seized in India in the six months through March. In meetings with companies, Indian regulators called the ""menace of abuse"" a ""growing concern"". Abuse is particularly common in Bangladesh. At a treatment center in the capital Dhaka, tales abound of ruined careers and family struggles.    A 40-year-old former banker at the Bangladesh Rehabilitation and Assistance Center for Addicts said his addiction was so bad he felt he loved cough syrup more than his four-year-old son.   ""I felt I must recover from this menace,"" he said, requesting anonymity because of the shame associated with addiction.The regulatory crackdown in recent years appears to have curtailed smuggling. About 750,000 bottles were seized in Bangladesh in 2014, 24 percent lower than 2013, the INCB said.Still, a fifth of Bangladesh's estimated 4 million drug users are addicted to such syrups, said Sayedur Rahman, a professor at the Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University.Inside Bangladesh, the cost of a bottle has more than tripled, indicating scarcity. Still, drug officials say the problem is underreported and more should be done. INCREASING PRESSURE   The latest crackdown on companies dates back to at least February 2014, the review shows.Indian narcotics officials told companies to take several measures, including reducing batch sizes and printing where it would be sold on the label.They also asked them to sell drugs from one batch to one stockist only, a measure the executive said was impractical.That summer, regulators temporarily held back Cipla's allocation of codeine, manufactured solely in government factories, after the company failed to inform the government about steps it had taken to comply with the directive. Cipla said it never received the request for information.   A Cipla spokeswoman said the company stopped making the drug last year after ""considering the business environment ... and the fact that this product was regulated by multiple agencies.""   At another meeting in October, government officials again pressured pharmaceutical companies to comply with their demands.In August this year, regulators sent a letter asking for updates on further steps they had taken, an industry executive said.

578,"   By Zeba Siddiqui | MUMBAI  MUMBAI India, which has dominated the generic drugs industry for decades, is falling behind in the race to make copies of complex biotech drugs, which are expected to generate tens of billions of dollars in sales in the coming years.    While Indian firms have launched a few such products on the domestic market, where regulatory barriers are relatively low, they are being overtaken by European, American and South Korean firms in the race to supply lucrative Western markets.    Just three Indian groups - Biocon Ltd (BION.NS), Dr Reddy's Laboratories Ltd (REDY.NS) and Intas Pharamceuticals Ltd - are working with partners on so-called biosimilars aimed at the United States and Europe.    Biotech drugs, which require genetic engineering, account for a growing share of new drugs and the future sales of copycat products will also switch to this category of pharmaceuticals from simple small-molecule pills like aspirin.     The global biosimilars market is predicted to have sales of $25 billion by 2020, according to a 2014 Thomson Reuters report.    ""Biosimilars is a big opportunity,"" said Sujay Shetty, leader of the life sciences practice at PwC India. ""But unlike generics, it is not yet an opportunity (for Indian companies) in the U.S.""    Copying chemical-based drugs has long been the bedrock of India's $15 billion pharmaceuticals industry. Biotech drugs, however, are more difficult to make and cannot be replicated exactly, which is why regulators have come up with the notion of versions that are similar enough to do the job.    That also means regulators will be eagle-eyed on quality, posing a challenge to Indian companies, which have been distracted in recent years by manufacturing problems that have led to some drugs being barred from key overseas markets.    Many, including the country's biggest drugmaker Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (SUN.NS), are still struggling to fix issues at their generic drug factories. ""FAR BEHIND""     Biosimilars have been available in India since the early 2000s, well before their 2006 arrival in Europe and the recent introduction of a regulatory pathway in the United States, where the first biosimilar was launched only last month. But India's experience has not been problem-free. Intas, for example, recently received reports of some patients on its biosimilar version of Roche's ROG.VX eye drug Lucentis developing inflammation barely two months after the drug's launch. An Intas spokesman said the problem was found to be in the drug's ""cold chain logistics"" distribution channel and has restricted supply of the drug.     Arun Chandavarkar, the chief executive of Biocon, seen by analysts as the front-runner among Indian firms developing biosimilars, believes the cost and complexity of developing biosimilars will be a deterrent for many Indian players.    ""At this time, there can't be too many companies willing to put in that much effort and investment,"" he said. The three Indian companies that have stated plans to make biosimilars for the United States and Europe are all partnered with larger Western firms.     Biocon has a tie-up with Mylan Inc (MYL.O) and is testing four molecules in global Phase III trials, for which it plans to seek approvals in the United States and Europe starting in fiscal 2017, Chandavarkar said. Dr Reddy's is developing biosimilars such as rituximab and pegfilgrastim for use in cancer treatment under a pact with Germany's Merck KGaA (MRCG.DE) and said it plans to launch its first biosimilar in the United States by 2018. A spokesman at Intas, which developed pegfilgrastim in partnership with Canada's Apotex Inc, told Reuters the company was considering partnering with a Swiss drugmaker to launch the product in the United States. It declined to name the firm. Chandru Chawla, head of Cipla Ltd's (CIPL.NS) new ventures unit, said India's ""fundamental disadvantage"" over United States, Europe and South Korea was that biotechnology never evolved in India to the extent that chemistry did.    ""In terms of having the right knowledge ecosystem and the pools of talent, India is far behind,"" he said.    Globally, Western pharmaceutical firms such as Novartis AG NOVN.VX; Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), in partnership with South Korea's Celltrion Inc (068270.KQ); and Merck & Co (MRK.N) with partner Samsung Bioepis, are leading in the race to dominate the Western biosimilars market.

Sales of the drug in India fell 4 percent to 121 million bottles in the year through August, and 15 percent in the year before, according to IMS Health, a healthcare statistics provider.For drug regulators, the challenge is to strike a balance.""Any non-therapeutic usage is a concern, but you have to weigh the risks versus benefits,"" said an official at the federal drugs controller in New Delhi.RISING COSTS According to an industry executive, the likes of Pfizer and Abbott, who control most of the $103 million market for the drug, face a ""significant"" increase in costs as plants run well below capacity because of changes demanded of them.And the regulatory regime could get tougher.According to minutes of a July meeting of state and federal drug regulators, there was a recommendation to ban the sale of the syrup altogether because of ""rampant misuse and its illegal exports to neighbouring countries.""""A large number of regulators were in favour of strict control,"" said Akun Sabharwal, drugs controller for Telangana, who attended the meeting. The federal drugs official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said an outright ban would not be easy to impose, given the medicine's importance. Abbott estimates roughly 60 million people suffer from regular dry cough in India.Pfizer's India unit said in a statement the company takes all steps to maintain the highest standards of regulatory compliance, including supply-chain audits.Abbott India said they believed existing Indian drug laws were adequate to control the abuse and the company had taken steps to support enforcement agencies.RUINED LIVES Last year, the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB) billed the abuse of medicines containing narcotics and their smuggling from India among the ""greatest drug-related challenges"" facing South Asia.About 83,000 bottles of codeine-based cough syrups were seized in India in the six months through March. In meetings with companies, Indian regulators called the ""menace of abuse"" a ""growing concern"".Abuse is particularly common in Bangladesh. At a treatment centre in the capital Dhaka, tales abound of ruined careers and family struggles. A 40-year-old former banker at the Bangladesh Rehabilitation and Assistance Center for Addicts said his addiction was so bad he felt he loved cough syrup more than his four-year-old son.""I felt I must recover from this menace,"" he said, requesting anonymity because of the shame associated with addiction.The regulatory crackdown in recent years appears to have curtailed smuggling. About 750,000 bottles were seized in Bangladesh in 2014, 24 percent lower than 2013, the INCB said.Still, a fifth of Bangladesh's estimated 4 million drug users are addicted to such syrups, said Sayedur Rahman, a professor at the Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University.Inside Bangladesh, the cost of a bottle has more than tripled, indicating scarcity.

583,"   By Matthias Blamont | PARIS  PARIS Oct 26 Sanofi's new chief executive is expected to show how he aims to get France's most valuable company back on track,  after being hit by lagging diabetes sales and boardroom rows,   when he presents his five-year strategic plan on Nov. 6.Previously in charge of Germany's Bayer  HealthCare, Olivier Brandicourt, 59, took the helm of the drugmaker in April, six months after the sacking of predecessor Chris Viehbacher who had clashed with the board over strategy and complaints of failing to communicate adequately.Brandicourt will also have to meet shareholder demands for the company to remain diversified while controlling costs and  keeping a look-out for acquisitions.Most immediately Sanofi faces growing competition in the treatment of diabetes, especially in the United States, the world's biggest pharmaceutical market.The company warned in April that sales in its diabetes division, one of its major revenue and profit earners, would fall this year.And Toujeo, a next-generation insulin launched at the end of March in the U.S to follow patent-expiring blockbuster Lantus, is still expected to weigh on costs.The company also has other strategic commercial launches it needs to succeed with, such as an anti-cholesterol drug, Praluent, which has recently secured approval in the U.S and the European Union, and dupilumab, a monoclonal antibody designed for the treatment of skin diseases and asthma.Industry analysts believe that still gives Brandicourt scope to cut costs and to refuel the drug pipeline using a balance sheet that is stronger than many European rivals.While investors will be invited to a day of presentations in  Paris on Nov 6, some details could emerge as soon as this week when Sanofi publishes third-quarter results on Thursday. ""We see upside potential from new CEO Brandicourt's first strategic update, for which market expectations remain moderate but which could bring potential cost savings in the new, simpler organisation,"" Morgan Stanley analysts said in a recent research note.In July, Sanofi announced a simplified structure from next January built around five global business units (GBU).""If the company still wants to remain diversified, the model needs to be agile,"" said Vincent Genet, a partner with consulting firm Alcimed, citing the need for more effort to cut costs and simplify operations in the group's divisions.The company is also hoping to clinch a deal with unions to boost productivity at its French plants by 20-25 percent over three years, union sources told Reuters on Oct 7. ""A 5 percent cost trim could boost 2017 earnings per share by 11 percent and by 8 percent over 2017-21,"" Morgan Stanley said. In 2014, Sanofi reported ""business"" earnings per share, which stripes amortisation, impairment and other costs, of 5.2 euros.Shares in Sanofi are up around 21 percent so far this year compared with a 14 percent rise in the Stoxx 600 Europe Health Care sector index.ACQUISITIONS, ASSET SALES Morgan Stanley analysts also say the group has the capacity to raise total debt of up to $40 billion for possible acquisitions, four years after buying Genzyme - a Massachusetts-based company which focuses on rare diseases like multiple sclerosis - for $20.1 billion. ""Should Sanofi use this firepower to buy a company close to current multiples, we calculate that a theoretical earnings per share accretion of around 20 percent ... in around five years"", they said.""We expect ... Brandicourt to elaborate on how and which types of deals could be done, and envisage a continuation of  company's current strategy of mid-size acquisitions rather than one larger acquisition,"" they added.But so far, Brandicourt has kept investors guessing about his exact intentions.During Sanofi's general meeting in May he said the company  needed to remain competitive in the areas where it ""can and must win"" and pledged Sanofi would maintain a broad product portfolio  whereas other European competitors such as Switzerland's Roche  or Denmark's Novo Nordisk have chosen to specialise.Brandicourt also said he would meet with Sanofi's main shareholders - led by French cosmetic giant L'Oreal  with a 9 percent stake.L'Oreal has said on numerous occasions it considers its holding in Sanofi to be solely ""financial"".And analysts say while the company wants to remain  diversified management could yet decide to sell some non-core businesses such as generics or animal health to help fund expansion in other areas such as oncology, where Sanofi has teamed up with U.S Regeneron.When working at both Pfizer and at Bayer Brandicourt managed a number of divestments which analysts have described in the past as successful, including Pfizer's sale of animal health unit Zoetis as well as Bayer's blood glucose monitoring business.

Keytruda and Opdivo list for about $150,000 for a year of treatment, and Ibrance goes for about $118,000.In addition, blood clot and stroke preventer Eliquis, which Pfizer and Bristol share, has begun to take off and is on track for annual sales of nearly $2 billion.""This is the best innovation-based new product cycle in these companies' storied histories,"" said Suntrust Robinson Humphrey analyst John Boris.

Merck and Bristol are testing their new immuno-oncology drugs in numerous combinations and in dozens of different types of cancer.Pfizer said it expected to introduce a drug from the same PD-1 class as Opdivo and Keytruda in 2017, with one or more additional launches each year through 2022.

The high cost of prescription drugs has become a major topic of the current U.S. presidential campaign, with calls by candidates and others to rein in prices and out-of-pocket expenses to patients.Merck Chief Executive Officer Ken Frazier called the pricing discussions ""a lot of noise"" that he does not believe will tarnish the industry's reputation.Pfizer CEO Ian Read said he believed that higher co-pays demanded by insurers were more of a problem for patients than prices charged by drugmakers.""We must preserve the market-based system in the U.S. that enables us to develop breakthrough treatments and cures for patients,"" Read said.Bristol-Myers shares were up 2.5 percent at midday, while Pfizer rose 2.2 percent, and Merck gained 1.4 percent.(Reporting by Bill Berkrot; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)",2015-10-28,PFE,"Wed Oct 28, 2015 | 11:04am EDT",CORRECTED-WRAPUP 1-Top U.S. drugmakers ride new products to strong results,http://www.reuters.com//article/pharmaceuticals-results-wrapup-1-pix-cor-idUSL1N12R1KO20151028?type=companyNews
591,"   By Bill Berkrot and Ransdell Pierson  Pfizer Inc, the No. 1 U.S. drugmaker, and Botox maker Allergan Plc said they were in friendly talks to create a pharmaceutical colossus but the prospect that the company would seek to avoid U.S. taxes sounded political alarm bells.Both New York-based Pfizer and Dublin-based Allergan said no agreement has been reached and declined to discuss any terms of the deal, which would potentially set up Pfizer to take advantage of Ireland's lower tax rates.Allergan shares rose 6 percent to $304.38 in U.S. trading, while Pfizer closed off 1.9 percent at $34.77.Pfizer is already facing political pushback at home that is only likely to intensify with the U.S. presidential campaign underway, as candidates take aim at high prescription drug prices and companies looking to avoid paying U.S. taxes.A spokesman for Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton said the candidate had not seen details of the proposed merger, but is against tax inversion maneuvers, in which U.S. companies relocate overseas to take advantage of lower tax rates.""Clinton is committed to cracking down on so-called 'inversions,' where a company chooses to leave the U.S. on paper to game the tax system, and believes we should reform our tax code to encourage investment in the U.S., rather than shipping earnings and jobs overseas,"" Clinton spokesman Ian Sams said.Democratic U.S. Senator Charles Schumer of New York said in a statement: ""The continued pursuit of inversions, mergers and foreign acquisitions of major U.S. companies for purely tax purposes shows there is a lot more work to be done to stop them.""From the right, developer and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said the deal was a reminder that the U.S. tax code needed an overhaul.SMOOTHER PATH ""These corporate inversions take capital and, more importantly, jobs offshore,"" he said in a statement. ""We need leadership in Washington to get the tax code changed so companies will be coming to America, not looking for ways to leave."" Billionaire investor Carl Icahn, who has endorsed Trump and launched a $150 million political action committee advocating tax reform to eliminate inversions, said a Pfizer-Allergan deal would result in the loss of the country's 10th largest company to Ireland. Analysts speculated a deal could be all or primarily done with stock because under new U.S. rules aimed at curtailing tax inversions, shareholders of the overseas company must own at least 40 percent of the combined entity.Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan suggested a price of $390 per Allergan share, funded by equity and debt. Allergan's U.S.-traded shares soared as high as $316.80 on Thursday.Earlier Thursday before the companies confirmed the talks, Pfizer Chief Executive Officer Ian Read reiterated his criticism of U.S. corporate taxes.""Our tax rate highly disadvantages American multinational high-tech businesses,"" Read said at a Wall Street Journal event. ""I am fighting with one hand tied behind my back.""Pfizer's effective tax rate is 25 percent, while Allergan's is 15 percent.Given that both sides characterized the talks as ""friendly,"" Pfizer is likely to have a much smoother path outside of the United States after running into intense political opposition in Britain and from AstraZeneca Plc's board in its failed, unsolicited bid last year.""It's definitely a far easier target for Pfizer than AstraZeneca,"" said Christophe Eggmann, investment director at GAM, who holds shares in both companies. ""The hurdle will really be the price."" Moody's Investor Service said the deal would have ""credit positive implications for both companies.""A tax inversion is being discussed in the current talks, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters. In its pursuit of AstraZeneca, Pfizer had hoped to employ such a strategy. Read said Thursday he was open to any moves that produce the best long-term value for the company and shareholders. He said he was looking at various growth strategies, including a deal. Pfizer is expected to decide by late next year whether to sell or spin off its older, off-patent products unit to pare the business and focus on innovative, patent-protected medicines.Allergan, the product of a recent merger with generic drugmaker Actavis, is selling a large portfolio of generic medicines to Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd for $40.5 billion.  CASH FROM BOTOX A purchase of Allergan, with a market value of more than $113 billion, would be the biggest in Pfizer's long history of huge deals, eclipsing the $90 billion Warner-Lambert acquisition through which it gained control of Lipitor, once the world's top-selling medicine.It would also restore the Viagra maker as the world's largest pharmaceutical company, worth about $330 billion, a position it relinquished after Lipitor went off-patent.Allergan expects revenue of more than $8 billion in the second half of 2015, not including generic drugs it is selling to Teva.Pfizer has annual sales of about $48 billion, with about $27 billion from patent-protected drugs, consumer products and vaccines, and about $21 billion from the business it is considering selling.Since the Warner-Lambert purchase, Pfizer has acquired Pharmacia and Wyeth, each deal under a different CEO.The deals have led to many thousands of job cuts. It is not known how many cuts would result from a tie-up with Allergan.Apart from the tax considerations, the deal would give Pfizer access to Allergan's wrinkle treatment Botox, with $2.4 billion in annual sales, and its $1.3 billion Restasis dry eye treatment.By Sept. 10, deal-making in all sectors of healthcare this year had reached a record $447.5 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data.Other large pending tie-ups include pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc's planned purchase of smaller rival Rite Aid Corp announced this week, and pending mergers of health insurers Aetna Inc with Humana Inc, and Anthem Inc with Cigna Corp.

592,"   By David Lawder | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Pfizer Inc faces political risks in Washington if it proceeds with a bid for Allergan, but with little chance of legislation to curb such tax inversion deals, the Obama administration may be able to throw up only limited obstacles.Lawmakers are widely seen as unlikely to tackle major tax code changes before the 2016 presidential election, but they were already scolding Pfizer publicly on Thursday, showing that companies considering inversion deals do face reputational risk. ""When corporations choose to invert and don’t pay their fair share of taxes, they leave the rest of us to pick up the tab. That isn't right,"" said Democratic Senator Richard Durbin in a statement. Durbin has voiced similar views on prior inversions, including one that was abandoned by retailer Walgreen.An inversion deal typically involves a U.S. company buying a foreign company and then relocating corporate headquarters, on paper at least, to the foreign company's home country, with the goal of reducing the combined company's overall taxes.New York-based Pfizer and Dublin-based Allergan said they have not reached an agreement and declined to give details. A tax inversion is being discussed in the current talks, which could create the world's largest drugmaker, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters.Ireland has been a frequent redomiciling destination for U.S. corporations fleeing the U.S. tax system, though most of them leave their actual core operations in the United States.The latest wave of inversions crested in late 2014, when the Obama administration cracked down, making it harder both to do the deals and to realize their benefits.  A U.S. Treasury Department spokesperson said further actions could be taken, but stressed that only Congress can slam the door completely.Among the department's options is tightening rules against a tax-dodging technique known as ""earnings stripping"" that is often a key component of inversions. This practice involves shifting profits earned in the United States to a lower-tax jurisdiction. ""We are continuing our review of a broad range of options for further action but there is a limit to what we can do administratively. Congress must take action to end this loophole‎,"" the Treasury spokesperson said in a statement.Steven Rosenthal, senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, a think tank, agreed that earnings stripping was a good place for the Treasury to start.""Otherwise you leave a loophole and incentive for these combinations to continue,"" he said.

U.S. GDP growth braked sharply in the third quarter, hurt by an inventory buildup and a slowdown in industrials, but economists expect a pick up in the current quarter given strong domestic fundamentals.""What is positive about the GDP number is that it showed consumers are strong,"" said Janelle Nelson, portfolio analyst at RBC Wealth Management in Minneapolis.Nelson attributed the strength to lower gasoline prices, improved housing trends and the strength in the labor market trickling down to consumers' spending patterns.Odds of a December hike increased to 43 percent as of Thursday morning from the 38 percent minutes before the release of the statement, according to the CME Group's FedWatch program. At 12:19 p.m. ET (1419 GMT), the Dow Jones industrial average was down 46.13 points, or 0.26 percent, at 17,733.39, the S&P 500 was down 2.62 points, or 0.13 percent, at 2,087.73 and the Nasdaq Composite index was down 17.15 points, or 0.34 percent, at 5,078.54.Seven of the 10 major S&P sectors were lower, with the interest rate-sensitive utilities sector's 1.3 percent fall leading the decliners.Still, the three indexes were on track for their best month in four years, helped in part by strong results from blue-chips. Nearly 60 percent of the S&P 500 companies have reported so far. Analysts now expect overall third-quarter profit to decline a modest 1.7 percent, compared with the 4.9 percent drop forecast at the start of the earnings season, according to Thomson Reuters data.Allergan's shares shot up 7.9 percent to $310.01 after the Botox maker confirmed it was in buyout talks with Pfizer.

601,"  (Repeats with no change to text)By David LawderWASHINGTON Oct 29 Pfizer Inc faces political risks in Washington if it proceeds with a bid for Allergan, but with little chance of legislation to curb such tax inversion deals, the Obama administration may be able to throw up only limited obstacles.Lawmakers are widely seen as unlikely to tackle major tax code changes before the 2016 presidential election, but they were already scolding Pfizer publicly on Thursday, showing that companies considering inversion deals do face reputational risk.""When corporations choose to invert and don't pay their fair share of taxes, they leave the rest of us to pick up the tab. That isn't right,"" said Democratic Senator Richard Durbin in a statement. Durbin has voiced similar views on prior inversions, including one that was abandoned by retailer Walgreen.An inversion deal typically involves a U.S. company buying a foreign company and then relocating corporate headquarters, on paper at least, to the foreign company's home country, with the goal of reducing the combined company's overall taxes. New York-based Pfizer and Dublin-based Allergan said they have not reached an agreement and declined to give details.A tax inversion is being discussed in the current talks, which could create the world's largest drugmaker, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters. Ireland has been a frequent redomiciling destination for U.S. corporations fleeing the U.S. tax system, though most of them leave their actual core operations in the United States.The latest wave of inversions crested in late 2014, when the Obama administration cracked down, making it harder both to do the deals and to realize their benefits.A U.S. Treasury Department spokesperson said further actions could be taken, but stressed that only Congress can slam the door completely. Among the department's options is tightening rules against a tax-dodging technique known as ""earnings stripping"" that is often a key component of inversions. This practice involves shifting profits earned in the United States to a lower-tax jurisdiction.""We are continuing our review of a broad range of options for further action but there is a limit to what we can do administratively. Congress must take action to end this loophole,"" the Treasury spokesperson said in a statement.Steven Rosenthal, senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, a think tank, agreed that earnings stripping was a good place for the Treasury to start.""Otherwise you leave a loophole and incentive for these combinations to continue,"" he said.

602,"   By Bill Berkrot and Ransdell Pierson  Pfizer Inc, the No. 1 U.S. drugmaker, and Botox maker Allergan Plc said they were in friendly talks to create a pharmaceutical colossus but the prospect that the company would seek to avoid U.S. taxes sounded political alarm bells.Both New York-based Pfizer and Dublin-based Allergan said no agreement has been reached and declined to discuss any terms of the deal, which would potentially set up Pfizer to take advantage of Ireland's lower tax rates.Allergan shares rose 6 percent to $304.38 in U.S. trading, while Pfizer closed off 1.9 percent at $34.77.Pfizer is already facing political pushback at home that is only likely to intensify with the U.S. presidential campaign underway, as candidates take aim at high prescription drug prices and companies looking to avoid paying U.S. taxes.A spokesman for Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton said the candidate had not seen details of the proposed merger, but is against tax inversion maneuvers, in which U.S. companies relocate overseas to take advantage of lower tax rates.""Clinton is committed to cracking down on so-called 'inversions,' where a company chooses to leave the U.S. on paper to game the tax system, and believes we should reform our tax code to encourage investment in the U.S., rather than shipping earnings and jobs overseas,"" Clinton spokesman Ian Sams said.Democratic U.S. Senator Charles Schumer of New York said in a statement: ""The continued pursuit of inversions, mergers and foreign acquisitions of major U.S. companies for purely tax purposes shows there is a lot more work to be done to stop them.""From the right, developer and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said the deal was a reminder that the U.S. tax code needed an overhaul.SMOOTHER PATH ""These corporate inversions take capital and, more importantly, jobs offshore,"" he said in a statement. ""We need leadership in Washington to get the tax code changed so companies will be coming to America, not looking for ways to leave."" Billionaire investor Carl Icahn, who has endorsed Trump and launched a $150 million political action committee advocating tax reform to eliminate inversions, said a Pfizer-Allergan deal would result in the loss of the country's 10th largest company to Ireland. Analysts speculated a deal could be all or primarily done with stock because under new U.S. rules aimed at curtailing tax inversions, shareholders of the overseas company must own at least 40 percent of the combined entity.Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan suggested a price of $390 per Allergan share, funded by equity and debt. Allergan's U.S.-traded shares soared as high as $316.80 on Thursday.Earlier Thursday before the companies confirmed the talks, Pfizer Chief Executive Officer Ian Read reiterated his criticism of U.S. corporate taxes.""Our tax rate highly disadvantages American multinational high-tech businesses,"" Read said at a Wall Street Journal event. ""I am fighting with one hand tied behind my back.""Pfizer's effective tax rate is 25 percent, while Allergan's is 15 percent.Given that both sides characterized the talks as ""friendly,"" Pfizer is likely to have a much smoother path outside of the United States after running into intense political opposition in Britain and from AstraZeneca Plc's board in its failed, unsolicited bid last year.""It's definitely a far easier target for Pfizer than AstraZeneca,"" said Christophe Eggmann, investment director at GAM, who holds shares in both companies. ""The hurdle will really be the price."" Moody's Investor Service said the deal would have ""credit positive implications for both companies.""A tax inversion is being discussed in the current talks, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters. In its pursuit of AstraZeneca, Pfizer had hoped to employ such a strategy. Read said Thursday he was open to any moves that produce the best long-term value for the company and shareholders. He said he was looking at various growth strategies, including a deal. Pfizer is expected to decide by late next year whether to sell or spin off its older, off-patent products unit to pare the business and focus on innovative, patent-protected medicines.Allergan, the product of a recent merger with generic drugmaker Actavis, is selling a large portfolio of generic medicines to Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd for $40.5 billion.  CASH FROM BOTOX A purchase of Allergan, with a market value of more than $113 billion, would be the biggest in Pfizer's long history of huge deals, eclipsing the $90 billion Warner-Lambert acquisition through which it gained control of Lipitor, once the world's top-selling medicine.It would also restore the Viagra maker as the world's largest pharmaceutical company, worth about $330 billion, a position it relinquished after Lipitor went off-patent.Allergan expects revenue of more than $8 billion in the second half of 2015, not including generic drugs it is selling to Teva.Pfizer has annual sales of about $48 billion, with about $27 billion from patent-protected drugs, consumer products and vaccines, and about $21 billion from the business it is considering selling.Since the Warner-Lambert purchase, Pfizer has acquired Pharmacia and Wyeth, each deal under a different CEO.The deals have led to many thousands of job cuts. It is not known how many cuts would result from a tie-up with Allergan.Apart from the tax considerations, the deal would give Pfizer access to Allergan's wrinkle treatment Botox, with $2.4 billion in annual sales, and its $1.3 billion Restasis dry eye treatment.By Sept. 10, deal-making in all sectors of healthcare this year had reached a record $447.5 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data.Other large pending tie-ups include pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc's planned purchase of smaller rival Rite Aid Corp announced this week, and pending mergers of health insurers Aetna Inc with Humana Inc, and Anthem Inc with Cigna Corp.

603,"  The proposed corporate tie-up between Pfizer Inc and Allergan Plc, both drug makers, is refocusing attention in Washington on tax-driven corporate inversion transactions.U.S.-based Pfizer moved last week to acquire Ireland's Allergan. Details of their deal were still unavailable, but the companies were said to be eyeing a tax inversion structure.WHAT IS AN INVERSION? In an inversion, a U.S. company typically acquires a smaller, foreign rival and then reincorporates into its home country, on paper at least, to escape U.S. income taxes.In most cases, the U.S. company becomes a subsidiary of the foreign company, although the U.S. company's core operations, such as management and research, remain in the United States. INVERSION RULE BOOK The Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service enforce the rules on inversions.For an inverting U.S. company, the goal is to satisfy the IRS's definition of being a company with a foreign parent, thereby escaping some of the tax burdens of being a company with a U.S. parent, while minimizing the transfer of actual control and management operations overseas.Under IRS rules, an inverted company will not be recognized as having a foreign parent if the shareholders in the old, U.S. company still own 80 percent or more of the new, combined company, and if the combined company has no substantial business activities in the foreign company's home country. In cases where the old U.S. shareholders hold between 60 percent and 80 percent, the inverted company can qualify as foreign-parented under certain restrictions, even if it fails the ""substantial business activities"" test.CRACKDOWN RISKS  Some Democrats have proposed a 50 percent foreign ownership test and other new limits, but legislation was widely seen as unlikely before 2017. Treasury could tighten its rules in the meantime, though it can only go so far on inversions without congressional action.Treasury last cracked down in September 2014, when it blocked inverted companies from using ""hopscotch"" loans to avoid dividend taxes when tapping tax-deferred foreign profits.It also barred inverters from gaining access to offshore profits through ""decontrolling"" strategies that make foreign units no longer U.S.-controlled; and it curbed ""skinny down"" and ""spinversion"" strategies aimed at circumventing inversion rules.Another way inverted companies cut taxes is earnings stripping, or shifting U.S. profits out of the country to a low- or no-tax jurisdiction. Treasury has been expected to issue tighter rules on earnings stripping, but has not yet done so.

Guggenheim is advising Pfizer alongside Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), while JPMorgan is advising Allergan alongside Morgan Stanley (MS.N), the people said on Monday. Other investment banks are also vying to secure roles, the people added.The sources asked not to be identified because the financial advisory roles are not yet public. JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley declined to comment, while Pfizer, Allergan, Guggenheim and Goldman Sachs did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Pfizer and Allergan have market capitalizations of $215 billion and $122 billion respectively. The deal, which is several weeks away from an agreement, would potentially set up Pfizer to take advantage of Ireland's lower tax rates, where Allergan is domiciled, according to the sources.

608,"  CAPE TOWN Global pharmaceutical company, Pfizer, has partnered with South Africa's Biovac Institute to produce a potentially life-saving pneumonia vaccine for infants, a cabinet minister said on Tuesday.According to the World Health Organisation, pneumonia is the leading infectious cause of death among children worldwide, accounting for 15 percent of all deaths for children under the age of 5 years.The five-year partnership, officially announced at Biovac's Cape Town manufacturing facility, will see technology transfer and skills upgraded for the production of 'Prevenar 13' vaccine on a sustainable basis, Science and Technology Minister Naledi Pandor said.""There is more that we can do to cut the costs of the vaccine, and that is to manufacture the vaccine here in Cape Town,"" Pandor told a news conference.Noting that vaccine prices have sky-rocketed over the last decade, Pandor said the pneumonia vaccine alone used up 40 percent of South Africa's budget for vaccines. ""There won't be an immediate saving because we will still continue to import ... but in the final analysis, when we get to 2020 we shouldn't be purchasing the vaccine in dollars but as manufactured in South Africa,"" Pandor said.At the moment, government paid 184.90 rand for a single dose of imported 'Prevenar 13', which each infant needing three doses of the vaccine, according to the Biovac Institute.  South Africa's government holds a 47.5 percent stake in Biovac, which currently supplies over 25 million doses of vaccines a year to fight a range of diseases, including tuberculosis and polio.By 2020, it was expected that Biovac, which also supplied vaccines across Africa, would provide 1 million South African babies with 3 million doses of the pneumonia vaccine. An acute respiratory infection that fills the lungs and caused by bacteria, fungi or viruses, pneumonia killed 935,000 children  under the age of 5 in 2013.The technology transfer takes place over the next five years and will entail the packaging of labeled syringes first before manufacturing is expected to start in 2020, Pfizer country manager, Jennifer Power said.

613,"  (Repeats story with no change to text)By Bill Berkrot and Ransdell PiersonNov 6 A Pfizer Inc merger with Ireland-based Allergan, in addition to providing tax benefits, would bolster the U.S. drugmaker's growth prospects should it decide to sell or spin off its portfolio of products that have gone off patent.Many Wall Street analysts believe Pfizer will decide to split late next year, after compiling three years of financial data treating its ""established products"" division, which sells generic medicines, and its ""innovative"" patent-protected medicines unit, as if they were separate companies.Such a split would dramatically boost the company's profitability, because in-patents drugs command much higher prices that rise every year, as opposed to off-patent medicines, that become commoditized and their prices decline.""This would be the creation of two companies really, not one huge $350 billion Pfizer,"" Andy Summers, co-portfolio manager at Janus Capital Group, said of the likely Pfizer split post merger. Janus is the 11th largest Allergan shareholder with about 6.5 million shares, according to Thomson Reuters data.Pfizer's $15 billion purchase earlier this year of hospital products maker Hospira, which sells generic injectable drugs and is developing biosimilar versions of top-selling biotech medicines, was widely seen as a move to make the established products business more attractive ahead of a sale.A combination with Allergan would add lucrative product lines to Pfizer's core innovative business, including aesthetics such as anti-wrinkle treatment Botox and facial fillers, and  opthalmology and neurology brands.At a business review on Wednesday, Allergan highlighted some of its more promising new medicines, including Viberzi for irritable bowel syndrome, which the company believes will be a $1 billion drug. Allergan could also contribute somewhat to established products as well, notably the Alzheimer's treatment Namenda, which was not included in the $40.5 billion agreement to sell Allergan's huge portfolio of generic drugs to Teva Pharmaceutical Industries.

But they represent renewed concern about the transactions. A wave of them peaked in September 2014 when a Treasury Department crackdown slowed, but did not halt them.The possible Pfizer-Allergan deal helps to ""highlight what can go on,"" Pocan, a small business owner, said in an interview on Monday.If Congress is going to pursue tax reform, closing such loopholes should be part of the conversation, he said.

620,"   By Kevin Drawbaugh | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Pfizer Inc's (PFE.N) buyout bid for Allergan Plc (AGN.N) has financial markets on edge over a possible new move by the U.S. Treasury Department against tax-inversion deals, but the outlook for any such steps was still unclear on Friday.    For months, Treasury has offered no fresh guidance on the inversion issue, leaving tax experts to speculate about what could come next. Inversions typically involve a U.S. multinational buying a smaller foreign rival and relocating to its home country, if only on paper, to escape U.S. taxation.    Allergan shares fell 2.3 percent on Thursday afternoon amid reports that Treasury might move to block its deal with Pfizer.    Possible steps the government might take include tightening the rules on two strategies related to inversions, tax experts said: ""earnings stripping"" and ""skinny down"" distributions.    Treasury took several actions in September 2014 to reduce the tax benefits available to companies that have inverted, while also making new inversions more difficult to do and less potentially rewarding. The moves stemmed a wave of inversions, but not before Minnesota medical technology group Medtronic (MDT.N) reincorporated in Ireland.

621,"   By Kevin Drawbaugh | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Nov 13 Pfizer Inc's buyout bid for Allergan Plc has financial markets on edge over a possible new move by the U.S. Treasury Department against tax-inversion deals, but the outlook for any such steps was still unclear on Friday.For months, Treasury has offered no fresh guidance on the inversion issue, leaving tax experts to speculate about what could come next. Inversions typically involve a U.S. multinational buying a smaller foreign rival and relocating to its home country, if only on paper, to escape U.S. taxation.Allergan shares fell 2.3 percent on Thursday afternoon amid reports that Treasury might move to block its deal with Pfizer.Possible steps the government might take include tightening the rules on two strategies related to inversions, tax experts said: ""earnings stripping"" and ""skinny down"" distributions.Treasury took several actions in September 2014 to reduce the tax benefits available to companies that have inverted, while also making new inversions more difficult to do and less potentially rewarding. The moves stemmed a wave of inversions, but not before Minnesota medical technology group Medtronic  reincorporated in Ireland.At the time, Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service said they were weighing further actions. On Friday, a Treasury spokeswoman offered more of the same language. ""The Treasury Department and the IRS expect to issue additional guidance to further limit inversion transactions,"" said the statement from late last year.That guidance said Treasury was looking at ways ""to address strategies that avoid U.S. tax on U.S. operations by shifting or 'stripping' U.S.-source earnings to lower-tax jurisdictions, including through intercompany debt.""Because U.S. corporations don't disclose what they pay in income taxes, it's hard to estimate how much revenue has been lost to inversions or could be lost in the future.

622,"   By Pamela Barbaglia and Greg Roumeliotis  Former U.S. Representative Eric Cantor helped Moelis & Co (MC.N), the investment bank he joined last year, secure an advisory role with Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) on its merger talks with Allergan Plc (AGN.N), three people familiar with the matter said.The appointment illustrates how well-connected veteran politicians can help investment banks win business with companies concerned about the political or regulatory risks associated with their deals. Cantor, who led Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives between 2011 and 2014 and is now a Moelis vice chairman and managing director, will help Pfizer navigate the political pitfalls of a deal with Allergan, the people said on Monday.Pfizer's intention to redomicile in Ireland following the merger with Allergan in a so-called inversion intended to reduce its U.S. tax rate has attracted the ire of several politicians, including some U.S. presidential candidates. Following a wave of inversions last year, the U.S. Treasury has  made inversions more difficult by requiring that at least 40 percent of the combined company be owned by the overseas company's shareholders. While the possibility of the U.S. Congress taking legislative action against Pfizer's deal during a presidential election year is seen as remote, the political controversy could spur Treasury to tighten the rules further to make inversions even more difficult.  Moelis and another investment banking boutique, Centerview Partners Holdings LLC, have joined Guggenheim Partners LLC and Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) as advisers to Pfizer on its negotiations with Allergan, the people said. Reuters reported earlier this month that Guggenheim and Goldman Sachs are advising Pfizer, while JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) are advising Allergan.The sources asked not to be identified because the advisory roles are not public. Moelis and Pfizer declined to comment, while Centerview did not immediately respond to a request for comment.A deal between Pfizer and Allergan, which have market capitalizations of $204 billion and $118 billion respectively, would be the biggest merger of the year and the largest ever transaction in the healthcare sector. Banks advising Allergan stand to earn collectively between $140 million and $180 million, while banks advising Pfizer could make between $80 million and $100 million in total, depending on the purchase price, according to estimates by consultancy Freeman & Co.Alergan's and Pfizer's advisers are finishing their due diligence and hope they can reach a deal before Christmas, one of the sources said.

624,"   By Greg Roumeliotis and Pamela Barbaglia  Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) is negotiating a 2-3 percent break-up fee with Allergan Plc (AGN.N) that would be in line with most deals, people familiar with the matter said, a sign of confidence that such a merger could overcome regulatory hurdles.    The break-up fee, to be paid by Pfizer if it were to walk away from Allergan, would come out to $3 billion to $4.5 billion based on a $150 billion deal value. That would make it one of the highest ever break-up fees in dollar terms. However, break-up fees are set in relation to the target company's size. One of the people familiar said a 2-3 percent fee would be at the lower end of similar transactions.   One of the main regulatory concerns about a Pfizer-Allergan merger pertains to the domicile of the combined company. U.S.-based Pfizer could move its headquarters to Ireland, where Allergan is based, to take advantage of lower tax rates. So-called tax inversions have driven other merger deals, but the U.S. Treasury is planning to clamp down on them. When the Treasury last tightened the rules on inversions in 2014, Chicago-based drugmaker AbbVie Inc (ABBV.N) paid a break-up fee of close to $1.7 billion to peer Shire Plc (SHP.L) to abandon its $55 billion merger agreement that would have seen it redomicile in Ireland.The largest beak-up fee ever agreed was $10 billion, and involved Verizon Communications Inc's (VZ.N) $130 billion deal in 2013 to acquire Vodafone Group Plc's (VOD.L) 45 percent stake in Verizon Wireless. The biggest break-up fee that has been paid was for $4 billion, when AT&T Inc's (T.N) $39 billion deal to acquire T-Mobile US Inc (TMUS.O) was opposed by regulators in 2011.The sources, who asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential, cautioned that the break-up fee and other aspects of Pfizer's deal with Allergan have not been finalized, and that the companies were still waiting for the Treasury to unveil its updated rules on inversions. Pfizer and Allergan both declined to comment.Pfizer is negotiating $370 to $380 for each Allergan share, a person familiar with the discussions said on Wednesday. Allergan shares closed at $302.05, down 2.8 percent, illustrating that investors are still worried about the deal's prospects. Pfizer shares ended down 3 percent at $32.29.""We struggle to see what the Treasury can do to specifically curb a Pfizer-Allergan combination, however, we also acknowledge that the political noise surrounding the redomicile of Pfizer - one of the largest pharma companies in the U.S. - will likely only increase with the announcement of a merger, and likely constitutes the most material hurdle to consummation of transaction of this nature,"" Citigroup analysts wrote in a note on Wednesday. As a wave of inversions peaked in September 2014, Treasury took several regulatory actions to reduce the tax benefits of inverting, while also making new deals more difficult. That slowed deal flow but did not stop it entirely.For months tax experts have speculated about what could come next from Treasury. Possible steps might include tightening the rules on two strategies related to inversions, tax experts said: so-called ""earnings stripping"" and ""skinny down"" distributions.Earnings-stripping rules combat shifting of U.S. profits out of the country to low-tax jurisdictions. Treasury has struggled to write new rules on this under present law, said tax experts.Rules targeting skinny-down distributions are meant to keep U.S. companies from shrinking their operations ahead of inversions to evade standards for minimum levels of foreign ownership in inverted companies.

634,"   By Pamela Barbaglia and Greg Roumeliotis  Pfizer Inc and Allergan Inc chief executives have agreed on the roles they would assume in a combined company, removing one of the last hurdles to the largest ever healthcare merger, people familiar with the matter said.Pfizer CEO Ian Read will be CEO of the combined company, while Allergan CEO Brent Saunders will have another very senior role, the people said on Friday, without providing more details. A deal announcement is expected in the coming days, one of the people added.The sources asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential. Pfizer and Allergan declined to comment.A top job at the combined company would position Saunders, 45, to have a claim at the CEO job when Read, 62, steps down. This arrangement also shows that Pfizer's management plans to remain in control, at least in the short term, even if the deal is technically structured so that Allergan buys Pfizer. The roughly $150 billion merger would see New York-based Pfizer redomicile in Ireland, where Botox-maker Allergan is registered.The U.S. Treasury Department on Thursday took steps to clamp down on tax-avoiding inversion deals with new rules, though there was scarce evidence it would stop the biggest inversion of them all, between Pfizer and Allergan.Read, a soft-spoken trained accountant, spent more than 30 years working his way up the Pfizer ranks, taking the reins in 2010 with the sudden departure of CEO Jeffrey Kindler. He viewed refocusing and reigniting the company's research engine as one of his most important tasks after a decade in which Pfizer had produced no important new medicines from its own labs.On Read's watch, Pfizer has seen approval of 10 new medicines, including the breast cancer drug Ibrance, which analysts forecast will eventually generate $5 billion a year, and Trumenba, a potentially important meningitis vaccine, both products of Pfizer labs. In his meteoric career, Saunders has lead Bausch & Lomb, Forest Laboratories and Actavis, which took the Allergan name after acquiring the Botox maker this year, all in the past five years. While his drug discovery credentials are not as strong as Read's, he is highly regarded among his peers as a CEO with top-notch operational expertise.A protégé of industry veteran Fred Hassan, who fixed Pharmacia and sold it to Pfizer, Saunders is credited with helping turn around struggling Schering-Plough and then leading its integration with Merck & Co.

635,"   By Greg Roumeliotis and Pamela Barbaglia  Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) is negotiating a 2-3 percent break-up fee with Allergan Plc (AGN.N) that would be in line with most deals, people familiar with the matter said, a sign of confidence that such a merger could overcome regulatory hurdles.    The break-up fee, to be paid by Pfizer if it were to walk away from Allergan, would come out to $3 billion to $4.5 billion based on a $150 billion deal value. That would make it one of the highest ever break-up fees in dollar terms. However, break-up fees are set in relation to the target company's size. One of the people familiar said a 2-3 percent fee would be at the lower end of similar transactions.   One of the main regulatory concerns about a Pfizer-Allergan merger pertains to the domicile of the combined company. U.S.-based Pfizer could move its headquarters to Ireland, where Allergan is based, to take advantage of lower tax rates. So-called tax inversions have driven other merger deals, but the U.S. Treasury is planning to clamp down on them. When the Treasury last tightened the rules on inversions in 2014, Chicago-based drugmaker AbbVie Inc (ABBV.N) paid a break-up fee of close to $1.7 billion to peer Shire Plc (SHP.L) to abandon its $55 billion merger agreement that would have seen it redomicile in Ireland.The largest beak-up fee ever agreed was $10 billion, and involved Verizon Communications Inc's (VZ.N) $130 billion deal in 2013 to acquire Vodafone Group Plc's (VOD.L) 45 percent stake in Verizon Wireless. The biggest break-up fee that has been paid was for $4 billion, when AT&T Inc's (T.N) $39 billion deal to acquire T-Mobile US Inc (TMUS.O) was opposed by regulators in 2011.The sources, who asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential, cautioned that the break-up fee and other aspects of Pfizer's deal with Allergan have not been finalized, and that the companies were still waiting for the Treasury to unveil its updated rules on inversions. Pfizer and Allergan both declined to comment.Pfizer is negotiating $370 to $380 for each Allergan share, a person familiar with the discussions said on Wednesday. Allergan shares closed at $302.05, down 2.8 percent, illustrating that investors are still worried about the deal's prospects. Pfizer shares ended down 3 percent at $32.29.""We struggle to see what the Treasury can do to specifically curb a Pfizer-Allergan combination, however, we also acknowledge that the political noise surrounding the redomicile of Pfizer - one of the largest pharma companies in the U.S. - will likely only increase with the announcement of a merger, and likely constitutes the most material hurdle to consummation of transaction of this nature,"" Citigroup analysts wrote in a note on Wednesday. As a wave of inversions peaked in September 2014, Treasury took several regulatory actions to reduce the tax benefits of inverting, while also making new deals more difficult. That slowed deal flow but did not stop it entirely.For months tax experts have speculated about what could come next from Treasury. Possible steps might include tightening the rules on two strategies related to inversions, tax experts said: so-called ""earnings stripping"" and ""skinny down"" distributions.Earnings-stripping rules combat shifting of U.S. profits out of the country to low-tax jurisdictions. Treasury has struggled to write new rules on this under present law, said tax experts.Rules targeting skinny-down distributions are meant to keep U.S. companies from shrinking their operations ahead of inversions to evade standards for minimum levels of foreign ownership in inverted companies.

637,"   By Kevin Drawbaugh and Ransdell Pierson | WASHINGTON/NEW YORK  WASHINGTON/NEW YORK The U.S. Treasury Department on Thursday took steps to clamp down on tax-avoiding ""inversion"" deals with new rules, though there was scarce evidence they would stop the biggest inversion of them all, between Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) and Allergan Plc (AGN.N).The $150 billion proposed deal, still under negotiation, would see New York-based Pfizer redomicile in Ireland, where Botox-maker Allergan is registered.

Allergan shareholders would own more than 40 percent of the combined company following a merger with Pfizer, people familiar with the terms being negotiated have said. ""If ...

639,"   By Greg Roumeliotis and Ransdell Pierson  Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) was due to secure formal board approval on Sunday for its acquisition of Botox maker Allergan Plc (AGN.N) for more than $150 billion, creating the world's biggest drug maker, according to people familiar with the matter. The deal, the largest ever in the healthcare sector, is sure to draw political ire in a U.S. presidential election year because Pfizer would redomicile to Ireland, where Allergan is registered, in a so-called ""inversion"" that would slash its corporate tax rate.It will also reignite debate in the pharmaceutical industry over the role of research and development, with Allergan Chief Executive Brent Saunders, a prolific dealmaker and a skeptic of in-house drug discovery, joining the combined company in a position to influence its strategy.   The deal would involve Pfizer paying with 11.3 of its shares for each Allergan share, the people said. There will also be a small cash component, accounting for less than 10 percent of the value of the deal, the people said.Pfizer's Chief Executive Ian Read, 62, will be CEO of the combined company, with Allergan's CEO Brent Saunders, 45, serving in a very senior role focused on operations and the integration, the people added. Saunders will also have a seat on the combined company's board, one of the people said.The sources asked not to be identified because the terms of the deal are not yet public. Pfizer and Allergan declined to comment.COLOSSUS The deal would create a pharmaceutical colossus with annual sales of more than $60 billion, putting the merged group well ahead of No. 2 U.S. drugmaker Merck & Co (MRK.N), which has annual sales of about $40 billion. Widely used Pfizer drugs such as Lipitor, Viagra and nerve pain treatment Lyrica would be brought together with Allergan's Namenda memory loss treatment, Restasis dry eye medication and other leading eye-care brands.It would be the biggest merger of the year, topping beer maker Anheuser-Busch InBev's (ABI.BR) proposed $107 billion takeover of SABMiller Plc SAB.L. And it would realize Read's longtime ambition of an inversion deal that would get Pfizer out from under the 35 percent U.S. corporate tax rate, among the world's highest. The tax rate in Ireland is 12.5 percent. Pfizer’s talks with Allergan come more than a year after the U.S. firm abandoned a bid to acquire AstraZeneca (AZN.L) and move its tax headquarters to Britain. The U.S. Treasury last year, and again last week, updated its rules on inversions to make it harder for companies to avoid U.S taxes by moving overseas. But experts have said these moves would do little to prevent Pfizer from inverting. Although Pfizer has decried the high U.S. corporate tax rate, it has minimized its U.S. taxes for years by selling its drug patents to overseas subsidiaries and then using them to make drugs that are sold back to U.S. affiliates. While generating big profit margins for its overseas arm, the practice has allowed Pfizer to report losses on its higher-taxed U.S. business in each of the past five years.     Many industry analysts and investors believe Pfizer could be bulking up with Allergan's fast-growing brands as a prelude to splitting by 2017 into two companies - one selling high-margin branded drugs and one selling inexpensive generics that have  dragged down Pfizer results over the past few years.      Read, a trained accountant, has said Pfizer could decide on such a split by late 2016, after it completes separate financial analyses of the two businesses. Pfizer's $15 billion purchase earlier this year of hospital products maker Hospira, which sells generic injectable drugs and is developing biosimilar versions of top-selling biotech medicines, was widely seen as a move to make its generics business more attractive ahead of a sale.Allergan has agreed to sell its own wide array of generics by early next year to Israeli drugmaker Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (TEVA.TA) for $40.5 billion.Speculation has been rife on Wall Street whether Read or Saunders would take the helm of the combined company, and whether Saunders would be content to play second fiddle to Read, who became Pfizer CEO in 2010 after more than 30 years with the company. Saunders has had a meteoric rise in the industry over the past five years, turning around eye-care company Bausch & Lomb and also leading Forest Laboratories and Swiss drugmaker Actavis, which took the Allergan name after acquiring it this year.  Earlier, he won plaudits for helping Schering-Plough overcome serious quality-control problems and then leading its integration with Merck & Co.Due to his rapid ascent and moves, Saunders has not presided over start-to-finish development of a drug, a process that can take 12 years or longer.And unlike large drugmakers who conduct costly discovery research, Saunders has said that it makes more sense economically to acquire medicines that have already shown promise in human trials.But in a recent interview, Saunders said he would be willing to put a higher emphasis on drug discovery if it makes sense for his company. Pfizer shares closed little changed on Friday at $32.18, while Allergan's rose 3.4 percent to $312.46, both on the New York Stock Exchange.

642,"   By Ransdell Pierson and Bill Berkrot | NEW YOR  NEW YOR Pfizer Inc on Monday said it would buy Botox maker Allergan Plc in a deal worth $160 billion to slash its U.S. tax bill, rekindling a fierce political debate over the financial maneuver.The acquisition, which would create the world's largest drugmaker and shift Pfizer's headquarters to Ireland, would also be the biggest-ever instance of a U.S. company re-incorporating overseas to lower its taxes. U.S. President Barack Obama has called such inversion deals unpatriotic and has tried to crack down on the practice.Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton pledged to propose measures to prevent such deals. The merger was also slammed by her rival Senator Bernie Sanders as well as by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.""The fact that Pfizer is leaving our country with a tremendous loss of jobs is disgusting,"" Trump said in a statement.It was not immediately known how many jobs would be lost as a result of the merger.Shares of Allergan fell 3.4 percent and Pfizer closed down 2.6 percent as investors learned the merger, under discussion since late October, would bring lower cost savings than they had hoped.Pfizer also disappointed some investors by delaying by two years a decision on whether to sell off its division consisting of products facing generic competition.To avoid potential restrictions, the transaction was structured as smaller, Dublin-based Allergan buying Pfizer, although the combined company will be known as Pfizer Plc and continue to be led by Chief Executive Officer Ian Read.The U.S. Treasury, concerned about losing billions in tax revenue, has been taking steps to limit the benefits of tax inversion deals, but it admitted last week that it would take legislation from Congress to stop such moves.The deal enhances offerings from both Pfizer's faster-growing branded products business, with additions like Botox, and its older established products unit. Still, investors had hoped Pfizer would sell off the lower-margin business in 2017, a move now put off by the time required to integrate Allergan. ""The only thing I'd really say I'm disappointed about is Pfizer's postponing their break up,"" said Gabelli Funds portfolio manager Jeff Jonas. He called the delay decision ""pretty conservative and a little late.""Others were disappointed by other aspects of the deal, including the projected cost savings, and a lack of details on potentially increased share buybacks.""Synergies of $2 billion plus in the third year are less than the $4 billion we had estimated in year 1,"" said Cowen and Co analyst Steve Scala.On a conference call with analysts, Pfizer said the merger would give it enhanced access to its tens of billions of dollars parked overseas and allow for more share buybacks, dividend payments and business development. The combined company would have annual sales of about $64 billion.The deal is expected to close in the second half of 2016. TAX SAVINGS Allergan CEO Brent Saunders will become president and chief operating officer of the combined company, with oversight of all commercial businesses.Read, who has long sought to slash Pfizer's U.S. tax rate,  said the deal would help put the company on ""on a more competitive footing"" with overseas-based rivals.The company had estimated it would pay about 25 percent in corporate taxes this year, compared with about 15 percent for Allergan. Pfizer Chief Financial Officer Frank D'Amelio said he expected a combined tax rate of 17 percent to 18 percent by 2017. The deal comes some 18 months after the failure of Read's initial attempt at an inversion, a $118 billion bid to acquire Britain-based AstraZeneca Plc that ran into stiff opposition from that company's management and UK politicians.Saunders said the combination would provide access to about 70 additional worldwide markets for Allergan products, such as Botox wrinkle treatment, Alzheimer's drug Namenda and dry-eye medication Restasis.For 166-year-old Pfizer, Allergan would be the fourth huge acquisition over the last 15 years - one for each of the last 4 CEOs - following purchases of Warner-Lambert, Pharmacia and Wyeth.This also caps a record year for healthcare mergers and acquisitions, taking their cumulative value in 2015 to more than $600 billion..They include prior big deals involving Saunders, such as the $70.5 billion acquisition of Allergan by Actavis, which then took the Allergan name, and an agreement to sell that company's huge portfolio of generic drugs to Teva Pharmaceutical Industries for $40.5 billion.Allergan and Pfizer estimated their merger would increase earnings per share by 10 percent, excluding special items, in 2019 and add by a high-teens percentage rate in 2020.The deal values Allergan shares at $363.63 each, about 16 percent more than their closing price of $312.46 on Friday. Pfizer shareholders would control of 56 percent of the combined company. The record-breaking deal includes $8 billion in debt, Pfizer said.Pfizer was advised by Guggenheim Securities, Goldman Sachs & Co, Centerview Partners and Moelis & Co.

643,"   By Ransdell Pierson and Bill Berkrot | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Pfizer Inc on Monday said it would buy Botox maker Allergan Plc in a deal worth $160 billion to slash its U.S. tax bill, rekindling a fierce political debate over the financial maneuver.The acquisition, which would create the world's largest drugmaker and shift Pfizer's headquarters to Ireland, would also be the biggest-ever instance of a U.S. company re-incorporating overseas to lower its taxes. U.S. President Barack Obama has called such inversion deals unpatriotic and has tried to crack down on the practice. Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton pledged to propose measures to prevent such deals. The merger was also slammed by her rival Senator Bernie Sanders as well as by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.""The fact that Pfizer is leaving our country with a tremendous loss of jobs is disgusting,"" Trump said in a statement. It was not immediately known how many jobs would be lost as a result of the merger. Shares of Allergan fell 3.4 percent and Pfizer closed down 2.6 percent as investors learned the merger, under discussion since late October, would bring lower cost savings than they had hoped.Pfizer also disappointed some investors by delaying by two years a decision on whether to sell off its division consisting of products facing generic competition.To avoid potential restrictions, the transaction was structured as smaller, Dublin-based Allergan buying Pfizer, although the combined company will be known as Pfizer Plc and continue to be led by Chief Executive Officer Ian Read.The U.S. Treasury, concerned about losing billions in tax revenue, has been taking steps to limit the benefits of tax inversion deals, but it admitted last week that it would take legislation from Congress to stop such moves.The deal enhances offerings from both Pfizer's faster-growing branded products business, with additions like Botox, and its older established products unit. Still, investors had hoped Pfizer would sell off the lower-margin business in 2017, a move now put off by the time required to integrate Allergan.  ""The only thing I'd really say I'm disappointed about is Pfizer's postponing their break up,"" said Gabelli Funds portfolio manager Jeff Jonas. He called the delay decision ""pretty conservative and a little late."" Others were disappointed by other aspects of the deal, including the projected cost savings, and a lack of details on potentially increased share buybacks.""Synergies of $2 billion plus in the third year are less than the $4 billion we had estimated in year 1,"" said Cowen and Co analyst Steve Scala.On a conference call with analysts, Pfizer said the merger would give it enhanced access to its tens of billions of dollars parked overseas and allow for more share buybacks, dividend payments and business development. The combined company would have annual sales of about $64 billion.The deal is expected to close in the second half of 2016. TAX SAVINGS Allergan CEO Brent Saunders will become president and chief operating officer of the combined company, with oversight of all commercial businesses. Read, who has long sought to slash Pfizer's U.S. tax rate,  said the deal would help put the company on ""on a more competitive footing"" with overseas-based rivals. The company had estimated it would pay about 25 percent in corporate taxes this year, compared with about 15 percent for Allergan. Pfizer Chief Financial Officer Frank D'Amelio said he expected a combined tax rate of 17 percent to 18 percent by 2017.The deal comes some 18 months after the failure of Read's initial attempt at an inversion, a $118 billion bid to acquire Britain-based AstraZeneca Plc that ran into stiff opposition from that company's management and UK politicians. Saunders said the combination would provide access to about 70 additional worldwide markets for Allergan products, such as Botox wrinkle treatment, Alzheimer's drug Namenda and dry-eye medication Restasis.For 166-year-old Pfizer, Allergan would be the fourth huge acquisition over the last 15 years - one for each of the last 4 CEOs - following purchases of Warner-Lambert, Pharmacia and Wyeth.This also caps a record year for healthcare mergers and acquisitions, taking their cumulative value in 2015 to more than $600 billion.. They include prior big deals involving Saunders, such as the $70.5 billion acquisition of Allergan by Actavis, which then took the Allergan name, and an agreement to sell that company's huge portfolio of generic drugs to Teva Pharmaceutical Industries for $40.5 billion.Allergan and Pfizer estimated their merger would increase earnings per share by 10 percent, excluding special items, in 2019 and add by a high-teens percentage rate in 2020.  The deal values Allergan shares at $363.63 each, about 16 percent more than their closing price of $312.46 on Friday. Pfizer shareholders would control of 56 percent of the combined company. The record-breaking deal includes $8 billion in debt, Pfizer said.Pfizer was advised by Guggenheim Securities, Goldman Sachs & Co, Centerview Partners and Moelis & Co.

646,"   By Kevin Drawbaugh and Emily Stephenson | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON U.S. politicians condemned Pfizer Inc's deal with Allergan Plc as a tax dodge on Monday, bringing another round of hand-wringing in Washington over the corporate tax code, though legislative action before 2017 is unlikely.Democrats heaped the most criticism on the New York-based drug maker, with Hillary Clinton accusing Pfizer of using legal loopholes to avoid its ""fair share"" of taxes in a deal that she said ""will leave U.S. taxpayers holding the bag."" The front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination said she will propose steps to prevent more inversions, but she did not provide details. ""We cannot delay in cracking down on inversions that erode our tax base,"" said the ex U.S. secretary of state and former New York senator in a statement.Republican front-runner Donald Trump, who has called for a corporate tax overhaul, called the deal ""disgusting"" in comments to news website Business Insider. Pfizer is doing the largest inversion deal of all time. In a $160-billion transaction, it plans to move its tax address from the United States to Ireland, if only on paper, by buying and merging into Allergan, a smaller, Dublin-based competitor.The combined company will be called Pfizer and will be run by Pfizer's CEO, with executive management staying in New York and extensive operations across the United States, but it will no longer be taxed as a U.S. company.More than 50 similar deals have been done over three decades by well-known companies such as Medtronic Plc, Fruit of the Loom and Ingersoll Rand Plc. Congressional researchers have estimated inversions, left unchecked, will cost the U.S. Treasury nearly $20 billion in the next 10 years. The White House declined to comment on Pfizer's deal, but a spokesman told reporters in a briefing that Congress should take action to prevent more such transactions.The U.S. Treasury Department last week unveiled new rules to clamp down on inversions, its second attempt to do so since a wave of deals peaked in September 2014. But the latest rules amounted to tweaks of existing law and will not impede the Pfizer-Allergan transaction, tax experts said.Senator Bernie Sanders, Clinton's chief rival for the Democratic nomination, said the deal ""would allow another major American corporation to hide its profits overseas.""Perhaps anticipating the deal would draw fire, Pfizer CEO Ian Read sent a letter on Monday to senior senators. The letter said, ""We will maintain our global operational headquarters in New York City. At the time we close the transaction, we will have over 40,000 employees across 25 states ...

652,"   By Ransdell Pierson and Bill Berkrot | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Pfizer Inc on Monday said it would buy Botox maker Allergan Plc in a deal worth $160 billion to slash its U.S. tax bill, rekindling a fierce political debate over the financial maneuver.The acquisition, which would create the world's largest drugmaker and shift Pfizer's headquarters to Ireland, would also be the biggest-ever instance of a U.S. company re-incorporating overseas to lower its taxes. U.S. President Barack Obama has called such inversion deals unpatriotic and has tried to crack down on the practice. Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton pledged to propose measures to prevent such deals. The merger was also slammed by her rival Senator Bernie Sanders as well as by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.""The fact that Pfizer is leaving our country with a tremendous loss of jobs is disgusting,"" Trump said in a statement. It was not immediately known how many jobs would be lost as a result of the merger. Shares of Allergan fell 3.4 percent and Pfizer closed down 2.6 percent as investors learned the merger, under discussion since late October, would bring lower cost savings than they had hoped.Pfizer also disappointed some investors by delaying by two years a decision on whether to sell off its division consisting of products facing generic competition.To avoid potential restrictions, the transaction was structured as smaller, Dublin-based Allergan buying Pfizer, although the combined company will be known as Pfizer Plc and continue to be led by Chief Executive Officer Ian Read.The U.S. Treasury, concerned about losing billions in tax revenue, has been taking steps to limit the benefits of tax inversion deals, but it admitted last week that it would take legislation from Congress to stop such moves.The deal enhances offerings from both Pfizer's faster-growing branded products business, with additions like Botox, and its older established products unit. Still, investors had hoped Pfizer would sell off the lower-margin business in 2017, a move now put off by the time required to integrate Allergan.  ""The only thing I'd really say I'm disappointed about is Pfizer's postponing their break up,"" said Gabelli Funds portfolio manager Jeff Jonas. He called the delay decision ""pretty conservative and a little late."" Others were disappointed by other aspects of the deal, including the projected cost savings, and a lack of details on potentially increased share buybacks.""Synergies of $2 billion plus in the third year are less than the $4 billion we had estimated in year 1,"" said Cowen and Co analyst Steve Scala.On a conference call with analysts, Pfizer said the merger would give it enhanced access to its tens of billions of dollars parked overseas and allow for more share buybacks, dividend payments and business development. The combined company would have annual sales of about $64 billion.The deal is expected to close in the second half of 2016. TAX SAVINGS Allergan CEO Brent Saunders will become president and chief operating officer of the combined company, with oversight of all commercial businesses. Read, who has long sought to slash Pfizer's U.S. tax rate,  said the deal would help put the company on ""on a more competitive footing"" with overseas-based rivals. The company had estimated it would pay about 25 percent in corporate taxes this year, compared with about 15 percent for Allergan. Pfizer Chief Financial Officer Frank D'Amelio said he expected a combined tax rate of 17 percent to 18 percent by 2017.The deal comes some 18 months after the failure of Read's initial attempt at an inversion, a $118 billion bid to acquire Britain-based AstraZeneca Plc that ran into stiff opposition from that company's management and UK politicians. Saunders said the combination would provide access to about 70 additional worldwide markets for Allergan products, such as Botox wrinkle treatment, Alzheimer's drug Namenda and dry-eye medication Restasis.For 166-year-old Pfizer, Allergan would be the fourth huge acquisition over the last 15 years - one for each of the last 4 CEOs - following purchases of Warner-Lambert, Pharmacia and Wyeth.This also caps a record year for healthcare mergers and acquisitions, taking their cumulative value in 2015 to more than $600 billion.. They include prior big deals involving Saunders, such as the $70.5 billion acquisition of Allergan by Actavis, which then took the Allergan name, and an agreement to sell that company's huge portfolio of generic drugs to Teva Pharmaceutical Industries for $40.5 billion.Allergan and Pfizer estimated their merger would increase earnings per share by 10 percent, excluding special items, in 2019 and add by a high-teens percentage rate in 2020.  The deal values Allergan shares at $363.63 each, about 16 percent more than their closing price of $312.46 on Friday. Pfizer shareholders would control of 56 percent of the combined company. The record-breaking deal includes $8 billion in debt, Pfizer said.Pfizer was advised by Guggenheim Securities, Goldman Sachs & Co, Centerview Partners and Moelis & Co. Its legal advisers are Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz; Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP and A & L Goodbody. Allergan was advised by J.P. Morgan, Morgan Stanley and Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP. Latham & Watkins LLP and Arthur Cox are its legal advisers.

660,"   By Pamela Barbaglia and Mike Stone | LONDON/NEW YORK  LONDON/NEW YORK Alan Schwartz knows how to play a long game. The executive chairman of boutique investment bank Guggenheim Partners spent almost 20 years cultivating Pfizer (PFE.N) boss Ian Read as a client. His strategy paid off handsomely when Guggenheim was named lead adviser for one of the biggest deals in history - Viagra-maker Pfizer's $160 billion acquisition of Botox-maker Allergan (AGN.N).Schwartz, 65, had been working with Read since 2013 to find a European-registered company with which U.S. firm Pfizer could combine and shift its headquarters to a country with a lower tax rate, so-called inverting.But their relationship stretches far further back, to the late 1990s, when Schwartz was a banker at Bear Stearns and Read was an executive working his way up at Pfizer, according to three people who have worked with Schwartz.Such ties with key executives partly explain why small investment boutiques like Guggenheim can sometimes trump full-service investment banks such as Bank of America (BAC.N) for advisory roles on mega-deals.Getting close to people in business development is very much part of the playbook of Schwartz, who has also spent the last two decades working closely with the likes of Verizon (VZ.N), Walt Disney (DIS.N) and Cablevision CVC.N.He works with operational managers on a long-term basis - without doing deals - to discuss strategy and cultivate trust, according to the sources. Then, when they reach positions of power and an M&A opportunity comes up, an advisory role is the prize.Guggenheim, whose partners rarely speak publicly, declined to comment. 'CODEWORD: PONY' The dealmaker was first noticed by Pfizer executives in the late 1990s, when he started presenting them with dossiers of possible takeover targets, according to one of the sources.In 2000 Pfizer decided to buy Warner Lambert, a company Schwartz was advising. Since then the U.S company has used Schwartz on many of their deals.     He led negotiations on Pfizer's $15 billion acquisition of Hospira this year, and before that he advised on their $60 billion takeover of Pharmacia in 2003. He also played a key role on the $16.6 billion sale of Pfizer's consumer healthcare unit to Johnson & Johnson in 2006 and helped the firm on the $2.4 billion sale of its Capsugel pill unit in 2011.The close ties he had cultivated with Pfizer and Read paid off most spectacularly recently when Guggenheim was named lead adviser on the Allergan deal - which ranks as the second-biggest M&A transaction ever.Schwartz was the last CEO of Bear Stearns before it was sold to JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N) in 2008, and the following year he joined Guggenheim, which is based in New York and Chicago.  Wall Street veterans who know Schwartz describe him as a masterful adviser who uses his strategic insight and dealmaking skills, rather than wining and dining, to cultivate company executives. ""He has an ability to immerse himself in the details of a company's business, the competitive landscape and a potential transaction while simultaneously framing these issues in the big picture as a consigliere to CEOs,"" said Flexis Capital Managing Partner Louis Friedman, a former Bear Stearns investment banker who worked with Schwartz for years.      Schwartz and other bankers working for Pfizer in its negotiations with Allergan would refer to the merger project as ""Pony"" in written communications to keep its identity secret, according to one of the sources. His main counterpart on the Allergan side was Steve Frank, co-head of global healthcare investment banking at JPMorgan.  Pfizer's acquisition of Allergan will be financed mostly with Pfizer's stock, so Guggenheim was not handicapped by its limited ability to provide debt financing compared with bigger rivals.In addition to Guggenheim as top adviser, Goldman Sachs Group (GS.N), Centerview Partners Holdings LLC and Moelis & Co (MC.N) also advised on the deal.TEAMWORK Although Schwartz's previous attempt at inverting Pfizer had been unsuccessful, it led to him hiring an investment banker, a move that helped cement Guggenheim's relationship with the drugmaker.Schwartz advised Pfizer last year when it approached Britain's AstraZeneca Plc (AZN.L) about a 70-billion-pound ($106 billion) bid, only for it to be snubbed. Also advising Pfizer however was Bank of America Corp's executive vice chairman of corporate and investment banking, Fares Noujaim, who Schwartz subsequently recruited to Guggenheim. Noujaim, 52, is a Lebanese-American banker who had moved up through the ranks at Bear Stearns. In 2008, before moving to Bank of America, he was vice chairman of Bear Stearns' board of directors while Schwartz was the bank's CEO. Noujaim's departure last year cost Bank of America its close relationship with Pfizer as the bank was no longer included in its advisory line-up.Pfizer and Bank of America declined to comment.Guggenheim was launched in 1999 by Peter Lawson-Johnston Sr, a great-grandson of gold mining magnate and New York museum founder Solomon Guggenheim. He injected $30 million of family money to fund the firm's operations in investment management, investment banking and insurance services.But it was only when Schwartz joined that the firm focused on building its advisory business and winning major investment banking assignments. For each deal, Schwartz typically surrounds himself with a team of five to 10 people.Guggenheim was at the bottom of U.S. M&A league table rankings between 2010 and 2012, but entered the top 10 in 2013 with 17 deals. The Pfizer deal moves Guggenheim to No. 12 from 18 in the worldwide M&A league table. It ranked 45 this time last year.Guggenheim and Pfizer's three other advisers will share between $125 million and $150 million in fees on the Allergan deal, according to a separate source familiar with the matter. ""This deal is only the latest step in a series of long-lasting relationships with big corporations that often lead to mega-deals,"" said another source close to Guggenheim.

662,"  (Repeats story published late on Thursday, with no changes)* Guggenheim named Pfizer's lead adviser on $160 bln Allergan deal* Schwartz has cultivated ties with Pfizer and its CEO over years* Getting close to execs on way up is Schwartz's tactic - sources* Such ties allow investment boutiques to compete with big rivalsBy Pamela Barbaglia and Mike StoneLONDON/NEW YORK, Nov 26 Alan Schwartz knows how to play a long game.The executive chairman of boutique investment bank Guggenheim Partners spent almost 20 years cultivating Pfizer  boss Ian Read as a client.His strategy paid off handsomely when Guggenheim was named lead adviser for one of the biggest deals in history - Viagra-maker Pfizer's $160 billion acquisition of Botox-maker Allergan.Schwartz, 65, had been working with Read since 2013 to find a European-registered company with which U.S. firm Pfizer could combine and shift its headquarters to a country with a lower tax rate, so-called inverting.But their relationship stretches far further back, to the late 1990s, when Schwartz was a banker at Bear Stearns and Read was an executive working his way up at Pfizer, according to three people who have worked with Schwartz.Such ties with key executives partly explain why small investment boutiques like Guggenheim can sometimes trump full-service investment banks such as Bank of America  for advisory roles on mega-deals.Getting close to people in business development is very much part of the playbook of Schwartz, who has also spent the last two decades working closely with the likes of Verizon, Walt Disney and Cablevision.He works with operational managers on a long-term basis - without doing deals - to discuss strategy and cultivate trust, according to the sources. Then, when they reach positions of power and an M&A opportunity comes up, an advisory role is the prize. Guggenheim, whose partners rarely speak publicly, declined to comment.'CODEWORD: PONY' The dealmaker was first noticed by Pfizer executives in the late 1990s, when he started presenting them with dossiers of possible takeover targets, according to one of the sources.In 2000 Pfizer decided to buy Warner Lambert, a company Schwartz was advising. Since then the U.S company has used Schwartz on many of their deals.He led negotiations on Pfizer's $15 billion acquisition of Hospira this year, and before that he advised on their $60 billion takeover of Pharmacia in 2003.

663,"  (Adds details on Third Point's investments)By Svea Herbst-BaylissBOSTON Dec 1 Daniel Loeb's main portfolio at hedge fund Third Point is nearly flat for the year, putting the billionaire investor far ahead of some industry rivals who have suffered heavy losses this year.In November, Loeb's Third Point Offshore fund dipped 0.2 percent, leaving it down 0.2 percent for the year, two people familiar with the private firm's numbers said on Tuesday. The firm's Third Point Partners fund, a smaller portfolio, dipped 2.2 percent last month and is now down 1.6 percent for the year. While Third Point, which invests roughly $17.5 billion overall, is trailing the broad Standard & Poor's 500 index's 1.8 percent gain this year, the firm is handily beating the average hedge fund's 2.3 percent loss for the year, according to data from Hedge Fund Research. Many hedge funds are losing money this year after being caught off guard by slowing growth in China and falling energy prices, while their concentrated bets on pharmaceutical companies have been hit as pricing practices in the drug industry have come under scrutiny.Late in October, Loeb told investors that he was betting more on stocks falling than rising even as he was sticking by his biggest upside bets on companies including healthcare powerhouses Baxter International Inc, Amgen Inc  and Botox-maker Allergan Plc, which agreed to sell itself to Pfizer Inc last month in a $160 billion deal. Loeb sidestepped some disasters too, having exited a significant long position in solar company SunEdison Inc  by the end of the third quarter and long before it tumbled 56 percent in November. Rival fund manager David Einhorn blamed his firm's 20.6 percent drop this year on SunEdison's poor performance.During the third quarter Third Point boosted its stake in fast-food empire Yum Brands Inc and established a new position in chipmaker Avago Technologies Ltd which gained in November. Food company Kraft Heinz Co, a new position during the third quarter, lost money in November.

671,"   By Ransdell Pierson | NEW YORK  NEW YORK The research chiefs of betrothed drugmakers Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) and Allergan (AGN.N) say the proposed combination of their experimental drugs deserves more credit, including potential blockbuster treatments for schizophrenia and depression.Pfizer agreed in November to buy Botox-maker Allergan for $160 billion in a transaction meant to slash Pfizer's tax rate and achieve other cost savings. The tax-inversion deal would shift Pfizer's headquarters to Dublin and is slated to close in the second half of 2016.Industry regulators and U.S. lawmakers have criticized the deal for its reliance on financial engineering. But more recently, company executives have said medical benefits of bringing together their drugs in development have been ""underappreciated"" and some healthcare analysts are making the case that combining the two research programs will yield sales and earnings ahead of Wall Street expectations.""There has been a lot of attention on financial aspects of the deal, but there has been an underestimation of the Allergan pipeline,"" Pfizer research chief Mikael Dolsten told Reuters in a recent interview.Dolsten told Reuters that Allergan's depression treatment rapastinel, which has shown promise of treating symptoms within hours rather than weeks required for standard treatments, could be ""transformational"" if it succeeds in late-stage trials.Further studies of Vraylar, a treatment for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder approved in September, could show it has ""unique"" ability to treat negative symptoms of schizophrenia, such as social withdrawal and slowed movement, Dolsten said. Relamorelin, potentially the first new treatment in decades for delayed emptying of food from the stomach, is another big opportunity, he said. Allergan has predicted peak annual sales of up to $2 billion for rapastinel and up to $1 billion each for Vraylar, relamorelin, an experimental treatment for uterine fibroids called Esmya and Allergan's recently approved Viberzi treatment for irritable bowel syndrome. It expects potential annual sales of up to $2 billion each for experimental treatments for migraine headaches and for a leading cause of blindness called macular degeneration. The forecasts have largely fallen on deaf ears, said Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan. ""Right now there are almost no expectations for Allergan's pipeline,"" Divan said. ""Even if they get just a few billion dollars out of these products, that would be more than people give them credit for."" Pfizer expects a modest lift to its earnings in 2018 from the planned purchase of Allergan, a boost of 10 percent in 2019 and a high-teens percentage boost in 2020. Divan said he expects Allergan's pipeline to add a few extra percentage points of sales and earnings growth in all three of those time periods.""We have 70 products in mid- to late-stage trials, but I think our pipeline is under-recognized,"" David Nicholson, research head for Allergan's branded products, said in an interview. He attributed the lack of visibility to the rapid series of acquisitions and deals that created the present-day Allergan, folding in the portfolios of large drugmakers such as Forest Laboratories and Actavis. ""It takes time for people to realize these are all part of one company's pipeline,"" said Nicholson. Nomura analyst Shibani Malhotra said less than 20 percent of Allergan sales are from outside the United States, and that Botox and other Allergan products could eventually get a surprisingly strong boost from 70 new international markets that Pfizer will open up, including Japan.""The biggest advantage for Allergan would be in leveraging Pfizer's global sales forces,"" Malhotra said.Pfizer Chief Executive Ian Read is slated to lead the combined company, with Allergan's younger Chief Executive Brent Saunders serving as president and chief operating officer.Nicholson, in a presentation on Tuesday with Read, Saunders and Dolsten at the annual JP Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco, said Allergan's pipeline deserves far more credit, as does Pfizer's array of immuno-oncology drugs.""When we put these pipelines together, (other) companies better watch out!""

But more recently, company executives have said medical benefits of bringing together their drugs in development have been ""underappreciated"" and some healthcare analysts are making the case that combining the two research programs will yield sales and earnings ahead of Wall Street expectations.""There has been a lot of attention on financial aspects of the deal, but there has been an underestimation of the Allergan pipeline,"" Pfizer research chief Mikael Dolsten told Reuters in a recent interview.Dolsten told Reuters that Allergan's depression treatment rapastinel, which has shown promise of treating symptoms within hours rather than weeks required for standard treatments, could be ""transformational"" if it succeeds in late-stage trials.Further studies of Vraylar, a treatment for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder approved in September, could show it has ""unique"" ability to treat negative symptoms of schizophrenia, such as social withdrawal and slowed movement, Dolsten said. Relamorelin, potentially the first new treatment in decades for delayed emptying of food from the stomach, is another big opportunity, he said.Allergan has predicted peak annual sales of up to $2 billion for rapastinel and up to $1 billion each for Vraylar, relamorelin, an experimental treatment for uterine fibroids called Esmya and Allergan's recently approved Viberzi treatment for irritable bowel syndrome.It expects potential annual sales of up to $2 billion each for experimental treatments for migraine headaches and for a leading cause of blindness called macular degeneration.The forecasts have largely fallen on deaf ears, said Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan. ""Right now there are almost no expectations for Allergan's pipeline,"" Divan said. ""Even if they get just a few billion dollars out of these products, that would be more than people give them credit for.""Pfizer expects a modest lift to its earnings in 2018 from the planned purchase of Allergan, a boost of 10 percent in 2019 and a high-teens percentage boost in 2020. Divan said he expects Allergan's pipeline to add a few extra percentage points of sales and earnings growth in all three of those time periods.""We have 70 products in mid- to late-stage trials, but I think our pipeline is under-recognized,"" David Nicholson, research head for Allergan's branded products, said in an interview. He attributed the lack of visibility to the rapid series of acquisitions and deals that created the present-day Allergan, folding in the portfolios of large drugmakers such as Forest Laboratories and Actavis. ""It takes time for people to realize these are all part of one company's pipeline,"" said Nicholson.Nomura analyst Shibani Malhotra said less than 20 percent of Allergan sales are from outside the United States, and that Botox and other Allergan products could eventually get a surprisingly strong boost from 70 new international markets that Pfizer will open up, including Japan.""The biggest advantage for Allergan would be in leveraging Pfizer's global sales forces,"" Malhotra said.Pfizer Chief Executive Ian Read is slated to lead the combined company, with Allergan's younger Chief Executive Brent Saunders serving as president and chief operating officer.Nicholson, in a presentation on Tuesday with Read, Saunders and Dolsten at the annual JP Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco, said Allergan's pipeline deserves far more credit, as does Pfizer's array of immuno-oncology drugs.""When we put these pipelines together, (other) companies better watch out!""

675,"   By Ransdell Pierson | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Pfizer Inc aims to drive profits in coming years with more-responsive and easier-to-manufacture new cancer treatments.With its French partner Cellectis, Pfizer is in the early stages of developing new cancer treatments called CAR T cells it says has major medical and manufacturing advantages over similar cell therapies being developed by others.The treatments are T-cells, white blood cells that act as soldiers against foreign invaders, that have been genetically altered to make them better able to spot and attack cancer. Pfizer research chief Mikael Dolsten said the treatments, if successful, could be a next big thing against cancer, following the recent launch of another impressive group of cancer drugs called checkpoint inhibitors. Those medicines, launched by Merck & Co and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co, take the brakes off the immune system rather than genetically tweaking immune system cells to spot and destroy cancer cells.     ""CAR T cells can probably be more powerful,"" Dolsten said in an interview.     Novartis and smaller biotechs Kite Pharma and Juno Therapeutics are farthest along in developing CART T cells, which in some small early-stage trials have eliminated all trace of blood cancers in as many as 90 percent of patients who had run out of other options. If approved, some analysts expect the treatments to cost as much as $450,000 for a single treatment. Their drugs are made by removing T-cells from the patient, genetically altering them to seek out a specific protein found on cancer cells and infusing the cells back into the patient, a process that can take weeks.Pfizer, with Cellectis' technology, aims to make off-the-shelf CAR T cells that can be used immediately. Instead of using the patient's own T-cells, its so-called allogeneic approach involves a single healthy donor who can potentially supply T-cells that can treat thousands of patients. But to succeed and be safe, those engineered cells would have to be further altered to ensure a patient’s body does not  reject the foreign cells, triggering a potentially deadly immune system response.The Pfizer/Cellectis method would allow the T-cells to be  manufactured at lower cost and be shipped to hospitals.  Pfizer believes it is uniquely placed to produce high quality off-the-shelf cells in quantities needed to treat thousands of patients.

679,"   By Ransdell Pierson  U.S. drugmaker Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) on Tuesday forecast 2016 revenue and earnings below analysts' estimates, largely because of the strong dollar.The company's shares fell slightly even though soaring sales of pneumonia vaccine Prevnar and recently approved breast cancer treatment Ibrance led to a stronger-than-expected fourth quarter.Pfizer, which plans to buy Botox maker Allergan Inc (AGN.N) in the second half of this year, said it expected earnings of $2.20 to $2.30 per share in 2016. That would not be much different from 2015 and falls short of the analysts' average estimate of $2.36 compiled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Pfizer attributed its cautious 2016 outlook largely to the stronger dollar, which hurts the value of sales outside the United States. It forecast 2016 revenue of $49 billion to $51 billion, up from $48.9 billion in 2015 but shy of Wall Street expectations of $52.49 billion.Tony Scherrer, director of research at Smead Capital Management, said Pfizer shares would eventually benefit from new products and acquisitions.In the meantime, he said: ""If anyone is looking for high and consistent cash flow, and strong profit margins, Pfizer has it.""  Pfizer's forecasts do not include the planned $160 billion Allergan purchase. Pfizer said on Nov. 23 that it would buy Allergan to slash its U.S. tax bill and obtain faster-growing medicines. Based in Dublin, the combined company's tax rate would be 17 percent to 18 percent by 2017, well below Pfizer's current 25 percent rate.  Allergan shares are trading at about a 17 percent discount to their value under the all-stock deal as some investors still fear the U.S. government could stop the deal.  But Chief Executive Officer Ian Read, in a conference call with analysts on Tuesday, said he still expected Pfizer to complete the merger as planned.""Under current law, I don't believe there's any reason why this deal won't close,"" Read said.

682,"   By Ben Hirschler | LONDON  LONDON AstraZeneca (AZN.L) warned on Thursday that revenue and earnings would drop this year due to the arrival of cheap generic rivals to Crestor, its top-selling cholesterol drug, which will offset growth in sales of newer medicines.The drugmaker, which saw off a takeover attempt by Pfizer (PFE.N) in 2014, is expected to see a trough in profits this year and next before a hoped-for resurgence on the back of a promising pipeline of experimental drugs.For 2016 AstraZeneca said that would mean a low to mid single-digit percentage decline in both revenue and core earnings per share, which exclude certain items, at constant exchange rates.With currencies expected to have a further adverse impact of around 3 percent, the downbeat outlook had dragged the shares down 4.2 percent to 4,227 pence by 4.58 a.m. ET. Many investors had expected AstraZeneca to predict broadly flat earnings in 2016, in part because long-term management incentives are tied to keeping earnings at or above $4.20 a share. The new guidance implies a figure of about $4.00.However, a company spokeswoman said the remuneration committee would take the dilutive impact of recent acquisitions into account when assessing performance, which Jefferies analysts said gave executives increased leeway to invest in research and development (R&D).TRANSITION  Chief Executive Pascal Soriot said AstraZeneca faced a ""transitional period"" due to the expiry of Crestor's U.S. patent in May, but the company was poised for a comeback and it would continue to plough investment into drug research.R&D spending this year is expected to stay around 2015 levels.""Clearly, 2016 will be a challenging year due to the loss of exclusivity for Crestor in the United States. It is a very, very big product,"" Soriot told reporters.But he reiterated AstraZeneca's ambition to build a business with annual sales of at least $45 billion by 2023, up from $24.7 billion in 2015.   Revenue in the fourth quarter of last year fell 5 percent to $6.4 billion, hit by earlier drug patent expiries, generating core earnings per share of 94 cents, up 26 percent.Industry analysts had on average forecast sales of $6.29 billion and earnings of 95 cents, according to Thomson Reuters.In addition to the Crestor hit, 2016 results will also be suppressed by short-term profit dilution from the recent acquisitions of Acerta Pharma and ZS Pharma.""AstraZeneca's results demonstrate progress is being made, with a number of positives clearly visible,"" said Mick Cooper of equity research house Trinity Delta. ""However, the overwhelming feeling remains that the light at the end of the tunnel is still some way away."" Soriot has been active in making bolt-on acquisitions of promising biotech companies to complement in-house research, while selling off non-core products to help pay the bills.Such divestments, or ""externalization"" deals, contributed $1.1 billion to revenue last year and that figure is expected to be higher in 2016, the company said.AstraZeneca has bet heavily on cancer medicine as a driver of future growth and it has several promising new products, including recently launched lung cancer pill Tagrisso.It also has high hopes in the hot cancer area of immuno-oncology but here it is competing with several tough rivals, including Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY.N), whose injectable drug Opdivo has a established a particularly strong position.Soriot acknowledged AstraZeneca was behind in monotherapy immuno-oncology but said it was making rapid progress in developing drug combinations.

702,"   By Brendan Pierson  By Brendan Pierson A federal appeals court has upheld a jury verdict in favor of Pfizer Inc against a man who said he developed a potentially fatal lung condition from Pondimin, one of the drugs sold by Pfizer's predecessor American Home Products Corp as part of the once-popular ""fen-phen"" diet treatment. Judge Norman Stahl of the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, writing Wednesday for a three-judge panel, ruled that a lower court was right to limit plaintiff Michael Tersigni's case to a failure to warn theory, and exclude his claim that American Home, renamed Wyeth in 2002 and bought by Pfizer in 2009, was negligent in designing and selling Pondimin in the first place.

703,"   By Ritsuko  Shimizu | TOKYO  TOKYO Global drugmakers said they could cut research spending in Japan due to new rules requiring them to slash prices on some blockbuster drugs, including Gilead Sciences Inc's highly effective but expensive hepatitis C drug, Sovaldi.Drugmakers such as the Japanese arms of Pfizer Inc and Eli Lilly and Co said the change, which could as much as half the price of popular medication, risks penalizing companies for developing revolutionary drugs like Sovaldi. ""Without stability and predictability in drug prices, investments will go elsewhere,"" Patrick Johnson, chief executive of Eli Lilly in Japan, recently told reporters.The comments come as the government works to attract research and development investment from pharmaceutical firms as a key part of a broader economic growth agenda.But the government also needs to curb soaring medical and nursing costs in a rapidly aging society, to help balance its primary budget by the fiscal year through March 2021.Policies focusing on medical costs rather than advanced development ""raise the risk of less investment in Japan,"" Pfizer's Japan head Ichiro Umeda told Reuters. ""A market that appreciates innovation allows for more investment and enables continuous development of revolutionary new drugs,"" he said.Beginning April 1, the government will lower the prices drugmakers can charge for popular drugs. For instance, prices will be cut by as much as 50 percent for drugs with annual Japan sales exceeding 150 billion yen ($1.34 billion) and that are 30 percent over estimates manufacturers file with the government.For Gilead's Sovaldi, the price will fall about 30 percent. Sovaldi has been shown to cure more than 90 percent of patients with the liver-destroying hepatitis C, without the side effects of older medicines. However, a price of $84,000 for a course of treatment in the United States drew criticism from insurers, politicians and patient groups.Gilead has since agreed to lower the price in over 90 mostly developing countries. But not in Japan, where about 1.5 million people are diagnosed with hepatitis C, and where Gilead said sales had helped push up global sales in the three months through December.When asked about Japan's rule change, the drugmaker told Reuters it was committed to ""delivering new treatments to as many patients as possible amid a changing market environment."" Others were more critical. Akira Kawahara, senior managing director of the Japan Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, told Reuters the rules were ""suddenly proposed and suddenly implemented.""Drugmakers had advised the government against the move when it came up for debate late last year. The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, which represents U.S. biopharmaceutical firms and researchers, had said the change would penalize firms for successful drug development.($1 = 112.2900 yen) (Reporting by Ritsuko Shimizu; Writing by Ritsuko Ando; Editing by Christopher Cushing)",2016-04-01,PFE,"Fri Apr 1, 2016 | 5:54am EDT",Drugmakers say Japan R&D spending at risk after government forces price cuts,http://www.reuters.com//article/japan-drug-idUSL3N1733M2?type=companyNews

707,"   By Pamela Barbaglia  Drugmaker Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) is leaning toward abandoning its $160 billion agreement to buy Allergan Plc (AGN.N) in light of the U.S. Treasury's new measures to curb such tax evading deals, a source familiar with the situation said on Tuesday.The discussions between the two companies and their lawyers are set to continue for the remainder of Tuesday and no final decision has been made, the source said, speaking on condition of anonymity. However, Pfizer is not willing to change the terms of its deal with Allergan which, under the new tax rules, would no longer benefit from the move to Ireland, the source said.Pfizer and Allergan declined to comment.The U.S. Treasury Department took new steps on Monday to curb tax-driven corporate inversions whereby companies seek to slash their tax bills by redomiciling overseas, though their core operations and management usually remain in the United States even as they claim a new tax home.Pfizer is concerned U.S. President Barack Obama's administration could change the rules again to thwart a deal. The source said the company's lawyers have presented alternative ways for the two companies to salvage the inversion but there was little appetite for it.""Pfizer is aware that the Treasury will keep ruling against any solution it can come up with,"" he said.One of the main hurdles to the deal was Treasury's decision impose a three-year limit on foreign companies bulking up on U.S. assets to avoid ownership limits for a later inversion deal. This means Allergan's latest deals -- which include the $66 billion merger of Allergan Plc and Actavis Plc, the $25 billion purchase of Forest Laboratories and the $5 billion takeover of Warner Chilcott - will not be counted and the business will fail to meet the ownership math for the deal.The source said the new rules came as a surprise as Pfizer was confident of delivering on its $160 billion proposed merger with Allergan. He said the management was rather expecting the Treasury to rule against inversions toward the end of last year when the two companies were looking at ways to bypass the existing law.     Pfizer and Allergan have always had an exit strategy in place, the source said. The two drugmakers agreed that either party may terminate the deal if an adverse change in U.S. law would cause the combined company to be treated as a U.S. domestic corporation for federal income tax purposes. The terminating party would have to pay the other company up to $400 million for its expenses, according to the merger agreement.Pfizer's Chief Executive Ian Read has tirelessly worked to find a merger partner and redomicile the business in Europe since dropping a takeover bid for British drugmaker AstraZeneca (AZN.L) in 2014.The source said Read firmly believes in the industrial logic of a deal with Allergan and the tax savings that the combined entity would achieve, but he has been put off by the Treasury's latest measures and is unwilling to fight a legal battle with the U.S. authorities.

708,"   By Caroline Humer and Ransdell Pierson | NEW YORK  NEW YORK The U.S. Treasury Department's proposed new tax regulations threw a series of corporate mergers into question on Tuesday, fanning a hot political situation and pushing Pfizer Inc closer to a decision to walk away from buying Botox maker Allergan Plc.Pfizer is leaning towards abandoning its $160 billion agreement to buy Allergan in light of the U.S. Treasury's new measures to curb tax-evading deals, a source familiar with the situation said on Tuesday.Pfizer is not willing to change the terms of its deal with Allergan which, under the new tax rules, would no longer benefit from the move to Ireland, the source said.U.S. President Obama on Tuesday called global tax avoidance a ""huge problem"" and urged Congress to take action to stop U.S. companies from tax-avoiding corporate ""inversions"", which lower companies tax bills by redomiciling overseas.""While the Treasury Department's actions will make it more difficult ... to exploit this particular corporate inversions loophole, only Congress can close it for good,"" Obama said.Besides Pfizer-Allergan, deals that could be affected by the new rules include the proposed $16.5 billion merger of Johnson Controls Inc with Ireland-based Tyco International PlcJohnson Controls said it is reviewing the regulations. Tyco did not immediately reply to a request comment.Waste Connections Inc and Canada's Progressive Waste Solutions Ltd said on Tuesday they will go ahead with their $2.67 billion deal. Both companies' shares fell.ALLERGAN SHARES PLUNGE The largest among the affected deals is Pfizer's plan to buy Dublin-based Allergan, move its headquarters to Ireland, and lower its tax rate. Allergan shares were down 15.4 percent at $234.94 in the busiest trading day in company history. Pfizer shares rose 2 percent to $31.33.Discussions between the two companies and their lawyers are set to continue Tuesday and no final decision has been made, the source said, speaking on condition of anonymity.Pfizer, which announced the deal in November, has said its tax rate would drop to about 17 or 18 percent after the deal, from around 25 percent. That would represent more than $1 billion in annual cost savings.On Monday night, Pfizer and Allergan said in a joint statement that they were reviewing the notice and declined to speculate on whether the deal would go forward.Allergan's bonds sold off in heavy trading on expectations the deal would fall through and that Allergan would not get the credit ratings lift that market players had expected by its merger with Pfizer.Trading activity in Allergan and Pfizer options surged to several times normal. Shares of M&A advisory firms, meanwhile, tumbled in response to the new U.S. inversion rules. The S&P 600 Investment Banking & Brokerage Index lost 2.9 percent, M&A advisor Evercore Partners fell 4.7 percent, while Greenhill & Co  was down 4.5 percent.HOT POLITICAL ISSUE The federal government has grappled with a wave of inversions in recent years as U.S. companies seek to slash their tax bills by redomiciling overseas, although their core operations and management usually remain in the United States even as they claim a new tax home.Late on Monday, the Treasury Department introduced a regulation that would negate the benefits of inversions.Treasury said it will impose a three-year limit on foreign companies bulking up on U.S. assets to avoid ownership limits for a later inversion deal. Allergan's key deals in the prior 36 months include the $66 billion merger with Actavis Plc and the $25 billion purchase of Forest Laboratories. Several U.S. presidential candidates, including Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton, have seized on the issue in their campaigns.""We have so many companies leaving, it is disgraceful,""  Trump told reporters as he greeted voters in Waukesha, Wisconsin.Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders both expressed support for Treasury's plan.NEXT STEPS? If Pfizer does not acquire Allergan's new, fast-growing medicines, Pfizer will need to look for other companies with attractive products, such as U.S. drugmakers Biogen Inc , Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc and AbbVie Inc , said Raghuram Selvaraju, managing director of brokerage H.C. Wainwright.Morningstar analyst Damien Conover said if the deal collapses, Pfizer will likely move up its decision on a key business strategy - whether to sell or spin off its hundreds of generic medicines.Pfizer had planned to make a decision by 2016 whether to split off its generics, but delayed the decision until 2019 after announcing its merger with Allergan. Conover said the decision could be moved to late 2017 or 2018.Jeff Jonas, a portfolio manager at Gabelli funds which owns Allergan shares, said Allergan stock was falling as merger-related investors sold out, but that Allergan as a standalone company is attractive.""They've been very successful as an acquirer over the years, making smart deals, not overpaying for them, integrating them well and making them work. They just get back to that,"" Jonas said.

The merger would have allowed New York-based Pfizer to cut its tax bill by an estimated $1 billion annually by domiciling in Ireland, where tax rates are lower.While the new Treasury rules did not name Pfizer and Allergan, one of the provisions targeted a specific feature of their merger - Allergan's history as a major acquirer of other companies.Allergan Chief Executive Brent Saunders said on CNBC television that the new Treasury rule would not stop the company from doing other stock-based acquisitions as soon as this fall. The new Treasury rule takes into account the past three years of a company's deals.""It really looked like they did a very fine job at constructing a temporary rule to stop this deal and obviously it was successful,"" Saunders said. Saunders said that he would stay to run the standalone company with a focus on both deals and research and development. Allergan will also move ahead with plans for its $40.5 billion sale of its generic drug business to Israel's Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA.TA). It expects the transaction to close by June.With the deal behind it, Pfizer said it would decide this year about whether to split off its hundreds of generic medicines into a separate business. It had put off making that decision until 2019 after announcing its deal with Allergan last November.Pfizer will pay Allergan $150 million to reimburse expenses from its deal. Shares of Allergan, which fell 15 percent on Tuesday, were up 3.3 percent at $244.38 at mid-afternoon. Pfizer rose 4.7 percent to $32.84.

It is not clear that Pfizer should definitely split into two, he said.""It is true that these larger companies are a little unwieldy to manage,"" Funtleyder said, ""but there are plenty of strategies to keep them together and increase shareholder value.""

Indexes slightly pared gains after the release of minutes from the most recent Federal Reserve meeting. They showed policymakers debated last month whether an interest rate hike would be needed in April, though a consensus emerged that risks from a global economic slowdown warranted a cautious approach.""The minutes were a little more hawkish than the tone that we've heard from (Fed Chair Janet) Yellen post-FOMC meeting, but that was to be expected somewhat in my view,"" said Scott Smith, senior market analyst at Cambridge global Payments in Toronto.Investors have been grappling with mixed signals from Fed officials, including comments from Yellen last week that eased anxiety about potential interest rate hikes. The collapse of the Pfizer and Allergan merger bolstered the healthcare sector on hopes that the pharmaceutical giants could turn to smaller targets.Pfizer shares rose 3.9 percent to $32.57 and gave the biggest boost to the S&P 500, while Allergan was up 3.6 percent at $245.05. The S&P healthcare index was up 2.2 percent, while the Nasdaq Biotech Index jumped 4.8 percent.

713,"   By Simon Jessop and Maiya Keidan | LONDON  LONDON Hedge funds which bet on mergers and acquisitions were hurt by the collapse of a $160 billion tie-up between pharmaceutical companies Pfizer (PFE.N) and Allergan (AGN.N) - although the effects could have been even worse.The deal was pulled after the U.S. Treasury drafted new rules to deter companies from moving their headquarters to countries with a more favorable tax regime, so called 'tax inversions', echoing the failed merger between Shire (SHP.L) and ABBVie (ABBV.N) in 2014 which hurt many funds.Shares in Allergan fell 15 percent on Tuesday after Reuters reported the mega-deal had likely fallen through, while Pfizer rose 2 percent. The companies confirmed the deal was off on Wednesday.While few funds came through unscathed, with large U.S. funds such as Paulson & Co among the worst hit, a mix of optimism the deal would go ahead and a reluctance to super-size positions had helped many trim their losses.""For managers doing risk-arb, it was super-consensual. But most people who were trading that specific spread were lightly hedged or were long Pfizer as well, which helped,"" said a London-based fund of hedge funds manager.""If you were purely trading the spread, you'd have been killed. Everyone got hurt, but most got hurt just on the Allergan leg, which is unusual.""Merger arbitrage funds often aim to make money by buying shares in a company that is the target of a takeover bid in the hope they will rise towards the offer price. They also bet that the share price of the company making the bid will fall and they can make a return from the spread between the two prices.If they think the opposite, they can reverse the trade, although data from industry tracker Markit showed less than half a percent of Allergan stock was out on loan heading into the news. The strategy is also used by funds with a broader event-driven investing remit, which aims to take advantage of share price differences that may occur in the run up to a corporate sale, or merger or other corporate event.PRESSURE         One investment consultant said the deal had cost the 12 hedge funds he tracks between 25 basis points and 70 basis points of performance. Lyxor Asset Management senior analyst Jean Baptiste Berthon said 16 funds, mostly located in the United States, had lost up to 1 percent of their fund's value after the deal fell through, although many had lost ""hardly anything"" by buying both stocks.Some had also hedged their exposure by placing a short position on other firms engaged in tax inversions, effectively a bet that the share price will fall, while others had kept position sizes small after being burnt by the Shire/Abbvie hit.Given there were relatively fewer tax inversion deals in play as a result of growing political pressure in the United States to curb them, there was much less risk of contagion across a merger-arb hedge fund's portfolio.""The situation seems quite different from last year where you could see several major deals with a tax inversion embedded in it, which had a very large ripple effect on these funds ... we are not seeing such contagion today,"" Berthon said. Fourteen tax inversion deals were announced in 2015 for a combined $183.7 billion, Thomson Reuters data showed, with Pfizer/Allergan representing the bulk. This year there have been just two tax-driven deals, valued at $33.8 billion.After making 8.4 percent during a bumper year for deal-making in 2015, merger arb funds had enjoyed a positive start to the year, data from Hedge Fund Research showed, with the HFRX Merger Arbitrage Index up 1.75 percent to end-March.The broader HFRX Event Driven Index, meanwhile, was down 1.13 percent in the year to end-March, HFR data showed, adding to a fall of 6.94 percent in 2015 and HFR President Kenneth Heinz said it could face a 20 basis points hit from Allergan.Given the solid month for many funds in March, the impact of the deal collapse would likely not weigh on year-end performance, said Anthony Lawler, Head of Portfolio Management at GAM Alternative Investments Solutions.""It hurts ... event driven investors will dislike this Allergan news, but it will not alone badly impact year-to-date numbers except for the very concentrated event managers.""

The collapse of the $160 billion merger of Pfizer and Allergan bolstered the healthcare sector on rising hopes that the pharmaceutical giants could turn to smaller targets.Pfizer shares rose 3.9 percent to $32.57 and gave the biggest boost to the S&P 500, while Allergan was up 3.6 percent at $245.05.Crude jumped nearly 5 percent after data showed an unexpected draw in U.S. crude stockpiles last week. A seven-week rally - sparked by rising oil, strength in the economy and a cautious Fed - helped stocks recover from a steep selloff that had sent the S&P 500 down more than 10 percent earlier this year. The index closed flat for 2016 on Tuesday.""We're still technically in a declining environment, and we have to get to an all-time high before we can give the all-clear signal,"" said Sam Stovall, U.S. equity strategist at S&P Global Market Intelligence in New York.Stovall said better-than-expected corporate earnings could provide the catalyst to drive stocks higher that investors were looking for. S&P 500 companies on average are expected to report a 7.4 percent fall in first-quarter earnings, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.At 12:48 p.m. ET (1648 GMT), the Dow Jones industrial average was up 68.15 points, or 0.39 percent, at 17,671.47, the S&P 500 was up 13.25 points, or 0.65 percent, at 2,058.42 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 49.43 points, or 1.02 percent, at 4,893.36.Seven of the 10 major S&P sectors were higher, led by a 2.09 percent rise in energy. The sector is up 2.5 percent in 2016, having tracked the rebound in crude.The S&P healthcare sector, which was up 2.03 percent on Wednesday, is one of only two sectors in negative territory for the year.Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 2,108 to 814. On the Nasdaq, 1,851 issues rose and 803 fell.The S&P 500 index showed eight new 52-week highs and no new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 24 new highs and 15 new lows.

716,"   By Lewis Krauskopf | NEW YORK, April 6  NEW YORK, April 6 The collapse of one pharmaceutical mega-merger could beget many smaller deals - at least that is the hope of biotech investors.Shares of the beaten-up biotech sector rallied on Wednesday as U.S. drugmaker Pfizer Inc and Ireland-based Allergan Plc called off their $160 billion merger after new U.S. Treasury rules aimed at curbing tax-cutting inversion deals.The Nasdaq Biotechnology index jumped 4.5 percent by mid-day, while the NYSE Arca Pharmaceutical index gained 2.5 percent. Healthcare was the top sectoral gainer in European trading, up 2.4 percent. With their deal scuttled, Pfizer and Allergan could turn to smaller targets, analysts said.Pfizer and Allergan ""have been serial acquirers in healthcare and both have significant financial firepower,"" BTIG analyst Hartaj Singh said. ""With biotech valuations down since mid-2015, the sector looks more appealing to acquirers."" Even with Wednesday's rally, the Nasdaq biotech index is down about 17 percent this year and some 30 percent from last July. Biotech and pharmaceutical shares have been under pressure from concerns about the focus on drug pricing, and that medicine costs will continue to be a target during the presidential election season.But investors have been looking for a pickup in deal-making as a sign the sector is ready to rebound.Investors ""want to see larger companies looking at smaller companies and buying them as an indicator that valuations have reached a point that they are very attractive for acquisitions,"" said Wedbush Securities analyst Liana Moussatos.

719,"   By Jessica Dye  A federal judge in Philadelphia dismissed more than 300 lawsuits against Pfizer Inc alleging that its antidepressant Zoloft caused birth defects in children born to women who took the drug while pregnant.The decision late Tuesday from U.S. District Judge Cynthia Rufe in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania said that plaintiffs had not produced enough evidence to show a plausible scientific link between the drug and birth defects, following several previous decisions that excluded testimony from key expert witnesses for plaintiffs.""The court recognizes that the final scientific verdict as to whether Zoloft can cause birth defects may not be delivered for many years,"" Rufe wrote. ""Nevertheless, plaintiffs chose when to file their cases, and the court concludes that for the plaintiffs who have continued to pursue their claims, the litigation gates must be closed."" The ruling affects more than 300 lawsuits against Pfizer consolidated before Rufe in federal court. A Pfizer spokeswoman, Neha Wadhwa, said the decision ""affirms that plaintiffs have failed to produce any reliable scientific evidence demonstrating that Zoloft causes the injuries they alleged.""Dianne Nast, a lead lawyer for the plaintiffs, did not immediately return a call for comment. Pfizer had previously prevailed in two trials involving Zoloft birth-defect claims in state courts in Philadelphia and Missouri.Zoloft is part of a widely prescribed group of antidepressants known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs. Plaintiffs said that the company played down the birth-defect risks of the popular drug in order to boost sales, while Pfizer denied it acted improperly and said that a number of major medical groups, including the American Heart Association, have supported its position.",2016-04-06,PFE,"Wed Apr 6, 2016 | 10:56am EDT",Pfizer beats hundreds of lawsuits alleging Zoloft birth defects,http://www.reuters.com//article/pfizer-lawsuit-zoloft-idUSL2N1790YJ?type=companyNews

721,"   By Bill Berkrot and Ransdell Pierson | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) Chief Executive Ian Read has investors standing behind him even after his second attempt at a huge tax-saving deal collapsed this week. The U.S. drug maker walked away from a $160 billion merger with Allergan Inc (AGN.N) on Wednesday because of new U.S. Treasury rules aimed at blocking the deal's tax benefits, marking the second major setback for Read in the past two years. In 2014, Pfizer failed in its unsolicited $118 billion bid to buy London-based drugmaker AstraZeneca Plc (AZN.L) after that deal ran into staunch opposition from British politicians. This time it was the U.S. government that threw up roadblocks to prevent Pfizer from relocating to Ireland, where former U.S. company Allergan is now based, with rules that appeared to be aimed specifically at Pfizer/Allergan.While failure on that scale often puts CEOs in jeopardy, 10 investors and portfolio managers told Reuters that Read still has their support. Read, they said, has a deep reservoir of goodwill after tackling many problems he inherited since taking over in 2010, including re-energizing Pfizer's faltering research and development operations. In addition, many of them blame the U.S. government, not Read, for the Allergan deal's demise.""Read gets an 'A' for effort. It was the right move for him to give Allergan a shot,"" said Gary Bradshaw, a portfolio manager for the Hodges Funds in Dallas.OTHER OPTIONS With annual sales of about $50 billion, Pfizer has other  options, including spinning off its large branded generics business. Pfizer had pushed back that decision by two years in announcing the Allergan deal, but said it will now make that call by the end of this year. Pfizer shares rose 5 percent on Wednesday after the deal was scrapped.Read is also likely to make other acquisitions to shore up its patent-protected drugs unit before shedding its generics business. Shares of several biotechs seen as possible acquisition targets for Pfizer and Allergan rose on Wednesday, after the deal was called off.Read announced the Allergan deal last November just days after the U.S. Treasury laid out a previous set of restrictions on so-called tax inversions aimed avoiding U.S. taxes. The deal was structured to avoid those restrictions, but included an unusually small breakup fee should further new tax rules end up scuttling the deal. This week, the U.S. Treasury announced a newer set of restrictions, which is what ended up killing the Allergan merger.Pfizer had to pay only $150 million, billions less than a standard breakup fee. That took some of the sting out of the deal's collapse for some shareholders.   Read, a trained accountant, has enjoyed strong support from the Pfizer board after restocking the company's portfolio of medicines in development and overseeing several important drug approvals.But it now appears his legacy will not include slashing the company's tax bill, a passion for Read who has said U.S. corporate taxes left him disadvantaged when competing with overseas rivals. Pfizer declined requests for comment from Read.NOT THE 'FALL GUY' Many of the investors Reuters spoke with said the U.S. government was responsible for the Allergan deal's collapse, giving Read a pass.  Oliver Marti, portfolio manager at Columbus Circle Investors, which has been a Pfizer investor, said Read ""has made some very smart decisions"" and the deal to buy Botox maker Allergan was one of them.""You work within the rules as best you can to win the game. Unfortunately, the Treasury has abused its authority and made up its own rules,"" Marti said.""Read shouldn't be the fall guy,"" agreed Tony Scherrer, director of research at Smead Capital Management, a longtime holder of Pfizer shares.The Treasury and many U.S. politicians, including presidential candidates, have argued that U.S. companies should not be allowed to strike deals to avoid paying taxes.        Allergan CEO Brent Saunders said in a telephone interview on Wednesday that the companies each had contingency plans in place if Treasury changed the rules again. ""While I'm sure Ian is personally disappointed, he hasn't skipped a beat and is absolutely focused on Pfizer and its independent future."" Asked if there was anything he could do to cheer up Read after his quest for lower taxes evaporated, Saunders said: ""His stock price is up. He doesn't need cheering.""

722,"   By Jonathan Stempel  A federal appeals court on Tuesday revived a class-action lawsuit accusing Pfizer Inc of causing tens of billions of dollars of losses for shareholders by misleading them about the safety of its Celebrex and Bextra pain-relieving drugs.By a 3-0 vote, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan said U.S. District Judge Laura Taylor Swain erred in dismissing the case after preventing Daniel Fischel, a former University of Chicago Law School dean, from testifying for the shareholders about potential damages.It also said Swain was wrong to conclude that jurors could not find Pfizer liable for statements by G.

Tuesday's decision returns the case to Swain. In a statement, Pfizer said it ""appropriately communicated accurate and science-based information about its medicines to investors and the public at all times and will continue to defend this case vigorously.""Concerns about the safety of Celebrex and Bextra mounted in late 2004 when rival Merck & Co withdrew its own Vioxx drug because of associated cardiovascular risks.Pfizer pulled Bextra from the U.S. market the following April, and agreed in September 2009 to pay $2.3 billion to settle a U.S. Department of Justice probe into the marketing of Bextra and other drugs. Shareholders accused the New York-based company of having concealed tests that began in 1998 and suggested health risks associated with Celebrex and Bextra.Writing for the appeals court, Circuit Judge Debra Ann Livingston said Swain ""went astray"" in excluding Fischel's expert testimony because of his failure to ""disaggregate"" alleged misrepresentations by Pfizer that may have inflated its stock price from any misrepresentations by Searle and Pharmacia. ""Plaintiffs' theory is directly contrary to this idea: they argue that Pfizer is liable for all of the artificial inflation related to Celebrex and Bextra because, through its own fraudulent conduct, Pfizer concealed the same information as its predecessors,"" Livingston wrote.In that context, she added, ""Fischel's testimony can be helpful to the jury.""A lawyer for the plaintiffs had no immediate comment.In afternoon trading, Pfizer shares rose 8 cents to $31.97.The case is In re: Pfizer Inc Securities Litigation, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 14-2853.",2016-04-12,PFE,"Tue Apr 12, 2016 | 1:47pm EDT","Pfizer must face revived Celebrex, Bextra safety lawsuit",http://www.reuters.com//article/pfizer-lawsuit-idUSL2N17F113?type=companyNews

731,"   By Sebastien Malo  NEW YORK, April 27 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Global charity Medecins Sans Frontieres delivered a petition with hundreds of thousands of signatures to pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc on Wednesday, asking the drugmaker to slash the price of its pneumonia vaccine for poor children.Supporters of a proposal to cut the vaccine price to $5 U.S. per needy child took their petition, and a baby's crib covered with signatures, to the company's New York City headquarters on the eve of its annual shareholder meeting.They made the same request of GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), which also makes a vaccine to prevent pneumonia.Pneumonia killed some 920,000 children globally last year, according to United Nations data, and many regions of the world cannot afford to vaccinate children against the acute respiratory infection, Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) said.Fifty-five nations, including Pakistan, Kenya and Myanmar, currently can obtain pneumonia vaccines at cut-rate prices through a public-private partnership called the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (GAVI).Those prices are about $10 U.S. for the Pfizer vaccine, which comes in three doses, and about $9 for a vaccine made by GSK.But MSF and supporters want those prices cut roughly by half in all developing nations and for humanitarian groups. ""Millions of babies and young kids around the world are left unprotected against pneumonia because Pfizer and GSK charge such high prices for the pneumonia vaccine,"" said Greg Elder, a MSF spokesman, in a statement.In response, Pfizer said producing its pneumonia vaccine, Prevenar 13, is costly and time-consuming.Every dose takes two and a half years to be produced, the company told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. ""We continue to help address humanitarian crises through donations of Prevenar 13 to humanitarian organizations,"" the company said.A dose of Prevenar 13 costs $159 on the U.S. private market, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.GlaxoSmithKline also said developing its pneumonia shot, Synflorix, involved extensive labor and money.""Synflorix is one of the most complex we've ever manufactured, essentially combining ten vaccines in one and requiring significant upfront capital investment,"" it said in a statement. Both companies said they make large quantities of the vaccines available at discounted prices through GAVI.According to the World Health Organization, pneumonia accounts for 15 percent of all deaths of children under 5 years old.Delivering the petition to Pfizer's midtown Manhattan building, protesters of its prices laid out 2,500 flowers they said symbolized the children dying of pneumonia each day.Overall, the cost of vaccinating a child in the poorest countries has been rising and is 68 times higher than it was in 2001, according to the MSF.Last month, MSF formally opposed Pfizer's application for a patent of its pneumonia vaccine in India.Poor countries and medical charities depend on Indian companies to make cheaper forms of drugs and vaccines, but with an Indian patent for Prevenar 13, those firms would not be able to produce affordable versions, MSF said.

733,"   By Ransdell Pierson | NEW YORK  NEW YORK After a planned purchase of Allergan Plc (AGN.N) was scuttled by the U.S. government, Pfizer (PFE.N) Chief Executive Ian Read on Tuesday said he would consider another merger of any size, at any time, as long as the deal makes sense.But he said Pfizer is at least temporarily abandoning its quest to lower taxes by relocating overseas, a main rationale for buying Dublin-based Allergan. The $160 billion deal fell apart last month after the U.S. Treasury Department issued stringent new rules against such tax inversion deals.Pfizer pays a considerably higher tax rate than European rivals. That has long rankled Read, a trained accountant who took charge of Pfizer in 2010. He argues the higher taxes put the drugmaker at a competitive disadvantage.""We'll have to work harder and be smarter,"" Read said in an interview. ""We can beat any company, whatever advantage they've got, if we use our resources better than they do."" Read said Pfizer's strong first-quarter results, reported earlier on Tuesday, demonstrated the company's ability to prosper as a standalone company. ""Not having (Allergan) still leaves us with a good hand to play,"" he said.Pfizer remains interested in deals that could help restock its medicine chest and ensure future growth, Read said, though he declined to name any biotech companies that were of particular interest. ""We have cash and resources and I'd entertain a deal of any size; size is not the issue,"" he said. ""The issue is does it make sense for our shareholders."" Pfizer plans by late 2016 to decide whether to sell or spin off its generic medicines, which it calls established products. Those products had first-quarter sales of $6 billion. Its other business, of patent-protected medicines, had sales of $7.03 billion.Read said Pfizer would be more likely in the short term to acquire innovative drugs, following its $16 billion purchase last year of generics maker Hospira. Asked if future deals were more likely to come before or after Pfizer decides whether to split the company, Read said he could not put such a timeline on a transaction. ""Assets appear and you make a decision whether to buy them or not.""  If the opportunity for a major acquisition arises, Read said Pfizer may again have to delay a decision whether to split up the company, as it did when the Allergan merger was announced. Pfizer initially delayed a decision by two years, but restored its original 2016 deadline after the deal fell through.

735,"   By Ransdell Pierson  Pfizer Inc, which last month abandoned its $160 billion quest for Allergan Inc, reported quarterly results that blew past analyst estimates on sales of its new cancer and arthritis treatments and the acquisition last year of hospital products company Hospira.The largest U.S. drugmaker also raised its revenue and earnings forecast for the year, helped in part by the weakening dollar. Shares of the company rose 2.4 percent in morning trading on Tuesday.Global company sales jumped 20 percent to $13 billion in the first quarter, which was $1 billion more than Wall Street had expected. But the quarter included five more days of sales in the United States than the year-ago quarter, adding revenue of $900 million in the most recent period. Pfizer said sales would be hurt in the fourth quarter of 2016, however, when those added days will be offset by fewer days.Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan said the results were impressive, with most drug categories beating sales expectations. But he said investors are eager to hear how Pfizer's overall strategy might change, given its dashed hopes for Allergan.  Pfizer walked away from the deal after the U.S. Treasury issued new rules curbing tax inversion deals, under which American companies move overseas to cut taxes.Many analysts believe Pfizer needs to buy new medicines or entire biotech companies to ensure competitive earnings growth. Meanwhile, its recently launched breast cancer treatment, Ibrance, is on its way to becoming a mega-blockbuster product. Its sales jumped to $429 million, from $38 million in the year-ago quarter. Morningstar analyst Damien Conover said sales of rheumatoid arthritis pill Xeljanz more than doubled to $197 million after new treatment guidelines from the American College of Rheumatology put it on par with standard injectable treatments for patients that have failed prior therapy. With the Allergan deal scratched, Pfizer has said it will decide this year whether to sell or split off its hundreds of generic medicines, called established products, into a separate business. When it announced its planned Allergan deal last November, Pfizer put off making the decision until 2019. Conover said Pfizer is likely for the remainder of 2016 to seek far smaller ""bolt on"" deals, possibly in the $5 billion to $20 billion range.""They really need to figure out whether to break into two pieces before doing a lot of big mergers,"" Conover said.Sales of Pfizer's generic medicines rose 17 percent in the quarter to $5.97 billion, while sales of its array of patent-protected drugs jumped 23 percent to $7.03 billion.     Pfizer in September 2015 completed its $16 billion purchase of Hospira, which makes a wide array of drugs and devices used in hospitals, especially sterile injectable products. Hospira products posted sales of $1.2 billion in the quarter.Net income rose to $3.02 billion, or 49 cents per share, from $2.38 billion, or 38 cents per share, a year earlier,  according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Excluding special items, Pfizer earned 67 cents per share, well above the average analyst estimate of 55 cents per share.Pfizer now expects 2016 revenue of $51 billion to $53 billion, from its earlier view of $49 billion to $51 billion, and earnings of $2.38 to $2.48 per share, from $2.20 to $2.30 per share.

745,"   By Amrutha Penumudi  Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) is buying Anacor Pharmaceuticals Inc ANAC.O in a $5.2 billion deal to add an eczema gel to its portfolio, just a month after the U.S. drug major scrapped plans to acquire Allergan Plc (AGN.N). Anacor shares surged as much as 56 percent to $99.94 on Monday, above the offer price of $99.25 per share in cash. The net-of-cash deal value assumes conversion of Anacor's outstanding convertible notes, the companies said in a statement.The deal hints at a shift in Pfizer's M&A strategy from lowering taxes - the rationale behind its $160 billion bid for Dublin-based Allergan - to strengthening its drugs portfolio ahead of a decision on selling or spinning off its generic medicines business by late 2016. The recent pullback in valuations of biotech firms could stimulate Pfizer's appetite for deals, analysts said. The company is also reported to be in talks to buy cancer drug maker Medivation Inc MDVN.O. The equity value of the Anacor deal is $4.45 billion, based on the company's outstanding fully diluted shares as of March 31. Anacor stock had fallen 43 percent this year to Friday's close. The acquisition will give Pfizer access to a non-steroidal topical gel, crisaborole, which is currently under review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of mild to moderate eczema.     Pfizer said it believed crisaborole had the potential to reach or exceed peak sales of $2 billion.In the past 15 years, there have been no new molecules approved for eczema - or atopic dermatitis - a common, relapsing, inflammatory skin disorder that affects 18-25 million people in the United States.  SURPRISE BUYER Some analysts said they had expected Anacor to be acquired by Allergan, which has a stronger presence in the dermatology market, or by Novartis AG's (NOVN.S) Sandoz unit, which sells Anacor's toenail fungus drug in the United States.Wedbush analyst David Nierengarten, however, said that Pfizer was strong in primary care and pediatric treatments, the target markets for crisaborole. He said other bids were possible, given that the $180.8 million termination fee was relatively low for a deal this size. Pfizer's current inflammation and immunology drugs portfolio includes Enbrel and Xeljanz, which target auto-immune diseases.Enbrel, marketed by the company outside North America, lost patent protection in Europe last year. The U.S. patents for the drug, sold in the country by Amgen Inc (AMGN.O), are set to expire in 2028.   Centerview Partners and Guggenheim Securities advised Pfizer advisers and Citi advised Anacor. Wachtel Lipton Rosen & Katz was Pfizer's legal adviser, while Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP advised Anacor.

751,"   By Jon Herskovitz and Fiona Ortiz  More than 20 U.S. states that use a combination of drugs to carry out lethal injections will find it harder to conduct executions due to Pfizer's ban on sales of its chemicals, but the move will have little impact on the handful that rely on a single drug.The pharmaceutical giant's move last week cuts off the last major U.S. source for drugs in the deadly mixes, and it adds to the difficulties of states that were already struggling to procure chemicals for lethal injections.Among the states affected are Florida and Oklahoma, which have been among the leaders in executions since the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976.Drug scarcity is also an obstacle for Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Delaware, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee and Wyoming.Since many mostly European drugmakers began banning sales of their products for use in executions about five years ago over ethical concerns, U.S. states have often turned to lightly regulated compounding pharmacies, which can mix chemicals. That has resulted in a string of lawsuits challenging secrecy in procurement and the quality of the mixes provided. Middlemen who flout Pfizer's ban could face sanctions.""Now a distributor who violates Pfizer's policies can face contractual liability and termination of its ability to sell any of Pfizer's medicines,"" said Robert Dunham, executive director of the nonprofit Death Penalty Information Center, which monitors capital punishment.Ohio, which has executed 53 inmates since the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976, said last year it was delaying all executions until at least 2017 due to trouble obtaining the necessary drugs.The state's problems worsened with Pfizer's decision because drugs on Ohio's protocol were on the company's list. BANNED DRUGS  The chemicals banned for sale by Pfizer (PFE.N) include the sedative midazolam, which has been used to render a prisoner unconscious, as well as pancuronium bromide, which can be used as a paralytic agent that halts breathing, and potassium chloride, which can cause cardiac arrest.Thirty-one U.S. states have the death penalty. But only six have an established one-drug protocol, including Texas, Georgia and Missouri, while two others where executions are on hold have plans to use a single drug for executions, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.The single drug most often used is pentobarbital, which is not made by Pfizer.Texas, which has executed 537 prisoners since 1976, more than any other state, said it should be able to obtain the chemicals it needs.""It's not anticipated that Pfizer's decision will have an impact on the agency's current ability to carry out executions,"" said Jason Clark, a spokesman for the Texas Department of Criminal Justice. Many of the states that rely on compounding pharmacies have laws banning the release of the pharmacies' names, which they say is needed as a security precaution.But Dale Baich, an attorney for death row inmates, rejected that. ""The purpose of the secrecy is to keep companies in the dark about the misuse of their products,"" Baich said.States have also looked overseas. Last year the U.S. Food and Drug Administration impounded a shipment of the execution drug sodium thiopental, ordered by Texas and Arizona from India, saying its import was banned and it has no legal use in the United States.DECLINING EXECUTIONS  The number of U.S. executions has been on the decline for years, falling to 28 in 2015, the lowest in more than two decades, and well off a peak of 98 in 1999, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.

753,"   By Ben Hirschler | LONDON  LONDON AstraZeneca's (AZN.L) drive to rebuild its portfolio of new medicines received a boost with positive results for an experimental biotech drug for severe asthma that the company previously flagged as a potential $2 billion-a-year seller.Benralizumab, which is likely to reach the market next year, was well tolerated and succeeded in reducing asthma attacks in two pivotal late-stage clinical trials, the drugmaker said on Tuesday.While it will be entering a competitive market, behind recently approved treatments such as GlaxoSmithKline's (GSK.L) Nucala and Teva's (TEVA.TA) Cinqair, AstraZeneca thinks benralizumab has the potential to be the best in class.Analysts are not yet convinced and consensus annual sales forecasts for benralizumab currently stand at just $450 million by 2021, according to Thomson Reuters Cortellis, well below the $2 billion predicted by AstraZeneca in 2014.The company gave its bullish forecast for benralizumab, along with many other pipeline products, at the time of Pfizer's (PFE.N) unsuccessful attempt to acquire it. Tom Keith-Roach, head of AstraZeneca's respiratory, inflammation and autoimmune business, declined to give an update on sales expectations but told Reuters that the drug's unique mechanism of action should position it well against rivals.Benralizumab works directly against cells in the body driving inflammation called eosinophils, leading to their rapid depletion, while rival medicines work less directly.Deutsche Bank analyst Richard Parkes said the market for severe asthma drugs could grow to be worth more than $7 billion a year and detailed results on benralizumab, potentially at a medical meeting in September, would be important in determining its commercial potential. AstraZeneca said it planned to submit benralizumab for regulatory approval in the United States and Europe in the second half of 2016.  Like the other injectable asthma drugs, AstraZeneca's product is designed for patients who have a history of severe attacks despite taking existing medications. AstraZeneca badly needs new drugs to drive future sales growth as it struggles with a wave of patent expiries on older medicines, such as its cholesterol fighter Crestor and stomach acid pill Nexium.Most attention is focused on its oncology drug portfolio but the company also has a long history in respiratory medicine and sees it as an important therapeutic area for the future.Benralizumab was originally licensed from a unit of Kyowa Hakko Kirin (4151.T). The Japanese company retains rights to the medicine in Japan and certain other Asian countries, but AstraZeneca has an option to acquire the Japanese rights once the drug is approved. AstraZeneca already has the rights elsewhere.

754,"   By Ransdell Pierson | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Pfizer Inc's (PFE.N) purchase of Anacor Pharmaceuticals Inc ANAC.O heralds an approaching wave of potentially safer and more effective treatments for millions who suffer from eczema, a common skin condition which causes infection-prone rashes that can feel like having poison ivy 24 hours a day. More than two dozen drugmakers are working on novel medicines to treat the condition affecting about 20 million Americans, also known as atopic dermatitis, and Pfizer's $5.2 billion deal positions it to become a market leader. Anacor's steroid-free topical ointment crisaborole is the first of the new treatments to be reviewed by U.S. regulators. An injectable therapy called dupilumab from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc (REGN.O) is expected to be submitted for U.S. approval later this year.    ""Until a few years ago, I don't think we had any message of hope for eczema patients who have tried everything,"" said Gil Yosipovitch, chairman of dermatology at Temple University School of Medicine who is a paid consultant for both companies. “Now we do.”    The two medicines greatly reduced eczema symptoms in late-stage trials without side effects accompanying current treatments. They could eventually see combined annual global sales of over $9 billion and face no significant competition for years.    Yosipovitch said Anacor’s crisaborole could be a valuable option for the 60 percent to 80 percent of patients with mild and moderate eczema on localized areas of the body. Dupilumab would be used for patients with more severe disease, he said.The global eczema drug market is currently worth about $4 billion in sales, mostly of topical steroids than can cause skin atrophy and increase risk of glaucoma and cataracts. Doctors may also prescribe oral drugs that suppress the immune system, such as cyclosporine, but they are not approved for eczema and can cause infections, shingles and cancer. There are no approved systemic drugs for the condition.    However, the cost of the new treatments may limit patient access. Regeneron's injectable dupilumab could cost $25,000 a year, similar to psoriasis drugs, at a time when U.S. health insurers are resisting rising drug prices. Analysts say it could eventually capture annual sales of $6 billion, with Anacor's drug costing more than $1,200 a year and having peak annual sales of up to $3 billion.     ""Payers know this will be a big market and will put up a lot of barriers and restrictions,"" said Yatin Suneja, an analyst with Suntrust Robinson Humphrey. Express Scripts Inc (ESRX.O) last month said it would scrutinize new eczema treatments and their expected prices.   LONG-TERM EFFECTS      Crisaborole blocks an inflammation-causing protein called PDE-4. In large clinical trials that included children and adults, it cleared or almost cleared treated areas of skin in half of patients with mild to moderate disease, with mild side effects.       ""We badly need a nonsteroidal topical that can get around serious steroid concerns and this drug showed no skin atrophy or other significant side effects,"" said Dr. Lawrence Eichenfield of the University of California San Diego and lead author of American Academy of Dermatology eczema treatment guidelines.     Regeneron and Sanofi (SASY.PA) aim to seek approval for dupilumab this year for adults with moderate to severe eczema. It blocks two proteins, IL-4 and IL-13, believed to cause eczema and allergic conditions like asthma.    In big trials, dupilumab led to an average 70 percent improvement in rash area and severity. Fewer serious side effects, including infections, were reported for dupilumab than for placebos. In separate studies it reduced incidence of asthma.    One concern over drugs like dupilumab, which regulate the immune system, is potential for serious side effects over time, including lymphoma. Such problems typically do not show up until a patient has used a medicine many years, said Dr. Cameron Rokhsar, a New York dermatologist with no financial ties to the drugmakers. Roche Holding AG (ROG.S) and AstraZeneca Plc (AZN.L) are developing injectable eczema treatments several years behind dupilumab. Data from mid-stage trials of the Roche drug, lebrikizumab, are expected in the second quarter. AstraZeneca plans this year to disclose data from a mid-stage trial of its tralokinumab in adults with moderate to severe eczema.       Nemolizumab from Japan's Chugai (4519.T) is also being tested in a mid-stage trial. The injectable drug targets IL-31, a protein associated with itch, a hallmark of eczema.""The main concept of our drug is to break the vicious itch-scratch cycle because scratching damages the skin and causes more intense inflammation,"" Dr. Michiaki Tanaka, a senior Chugai research executive, said in an interview.    Celgene Inc (CELG.O) recently tested its psoriasis drug apremilast in about 200 patients with moderate to severe eczema. It has not publicized the results, but researchers and analysts say it could become the first approved oral treatment for eczema. The pill has caused nausea and other gastrointestinal problems in psoriasis patients.         ""I'm very excited about apremilast because we have no approved oral drug for eczema,"" said Dr. Emma Guttman-Yassky of Mt. Sinai Medical Center in New York. She helped conduct trials of apremilast and dupilumab.

755,"   By Amrutha Penumudi  Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) is buying Anacor Pharmaceuticals Inc ANAC.O in a $5.2 billion deal to add an eczema gel to its portfolio, just a month after the U.S. drug major scrapped plans to acquire Allergan Plc (AGN.N). Anacor shares surged as much as 56 percent to $99.94 on Monday, above the offer price of $99.25 per share in cash. The net-of-cash deal value assumes conversion of Anacor's outstanding convertible notes, the companies said in a statement.The deal hints at a shift in Pfizer's M&A strategy from lowering taxes - the rationale behind its $160 billion bid for Dublin-based Allergan - to strengthening its drugs portfolio ahead of a decision on selling or spinning off its generic medicines business by late 2016. The recent pullback in valuations of biotech firms could stimulate Pfizer's appetite for deals, analysts said. The company is also reported to be in talks to buy cancer drug maker Medivation Inc MDVN.O. The equity value of the Anacor deal is $4.45 billion, based on the company's outstanding fully diluted shares as of March 31. Anacor stock had fallen 43 percent this year to Friday's close. The acquisition will give Pfizer access to a non-steroidal topical gel, crisaborole, which is currently under review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of mild to moderate eczema.     Pfizer said it believed crisaborole had the potential to reach or exceed peak sales of $2 billion.In the past 15 years, there have been no new molecules approved for eczema - or atopic dermatitis - a common, relapsing, inflammatory skin disorder that affects 18-25 million people in the United States.  SURPRISE BUYER Some analysts said they had expected Anacor to be acquired by Allergan, which has a stronger presence in the dermatology market, or by Novartis AG's (NOVN.S) Sandoz unit, which sells Anacor's toenail fungus drug in the United States.Wedbush analyst David Nierengarten, however, said that Pfizer was strong in primary care and pediatric treatments, the target markets for crisaborole. He said other bids were possible, given that the $180.8 million termination fee was relatively low for a deal this size. Pfizer's current inflammation and immunology drugs portfolio includes Enbrel and Xeljanz, which target auto-immune diseases.Enbrel, marketed by the company outside North America, lost patent protection in Europe last year. The U.S. patents for the drug, sold in the country by Amgen Inc (AMGN.O), are set to expire in 2028.   Centerview Partners and Guggenheim Securities advised Pfizer advisers and Citi advised Anacor.

772,"   By Sarah N. Lynch | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Some major U.S. drug companies have hired their own auditors to perform compliance reviews mandated in government settlements over alleged civil violations, such as paying kickbacks or off-label drug promotion, according to federal records reviewed by Reuters.Third-party compliance reviews are playing an increasingly large role in helping the government ensure companies fulfill their obligations in federal settlements.But unlike the Justice Department or the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Department of Health and Human Services inspector general does not prohibit companies from hiring firms with whom they have existing business ties.Some lawmakers and legal experts say that practice creates conflicts of interest and could impair outside reviewers' independence.""If the goal of this whole thing is to have an energetic and independent reviewer ferreting out mistakes and potential fraud within the company, do not put them under the financial thumb of the people who have millions of dollars at stake in keeping the audit work,"" said Kevin Outterson, a professor of health and corporate law at Boston University.Several large drug makers - including Novartis, GlaxoSmithKline, Merck, Sanofi and Allergan Inc. - have relied on their existing or previous auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) or Ernst & Young (EY), to also serve as compliance reviewers, according to corporate filings and a list of reviewers.The health agency's inspector general provided the list of reviewers hired by drug companies in response to a Reuters Freedom of Information Act request.The inspector general typically settles civil claims through the use of a ""corporate integrity agreement"" mandating various reforms.These five-year deals often require the hiring of an independent compliance consultant known as an ""independent review organization,"" which is tasked with reviewing internal policies and data, such as payments to doctors.In exchange, the inspector general's office agrees not to exclude a company from participating in Medicaid and Medicare.Susan Gillin, an attorney in the inspector general's office, said she agreed that “theoretically, a potential conflict of interest exists.”But she said her agency has not observed any problems with weak oversight by auditors serving in dual roles. Such arrangements are allowed, she said, as long as the firm is not involved in corporate management or advising on policies it will also review.""We have very few repeat parties to corporate integrity agreements,” she said.  While some companies have had multiple settlements over the years, they typically cover different alleged violations, or conduct committed by companies that, between settlements, became part of a different firm through an acquisition, Gillin said.Spokespeople for Novartis, Merck, GlaxoSmithKline and Sanofi all said they disclosed their business relationships to the inspector general, which reviewed them. A spokesman for Allergan Plc. said the arrangement predated the company's acquisition by Actavis in March 2015.Executives at PwC and Ernst & Young told Reuters they believe their dual work auditing and conducting compliance reviews are not in conflict and that they comply with all applicable regulations.The compliance reviewers “are independent in fact and in appearance,"" said EY Vice Chair Ron Hauben.Nancy Beacham, a partner at PwC, said the firm adheres to federal standards for all public company auditing engagements.""We abide by the rules of what we can and cannot do,"" she said. BIG CONTRACTS AT STAKE Some legal experts who see a conflict in the dual role say it can be exacerbated by the fact that accounting firms are generally paid more for their audit work than for these sorts of compliance reviews.For example, prior to Allergan Inc's acquisition by Actavis in March 2015, the company disclosed that in fiscal year 2012, it paid Ernst & Young more than $5 million in audit fees, compared with more than $440,000 it paid the firm for compliance work performed under the corporate integrity agreement.""Work with a major company is an important contract, and an established contractor isn't going to be independent,"" said Brandon Garrett, a professor at the University of Virginia School of Law.Senate Judiciary Chairman Charles Grassley, an Iowa Republican, said such arrangements could weaken enforcement.""If the firms enforcing the agreements aren't independent,” he told Reuters in a statement, that “defeats the purpose of the agreements.""While some companies hire their auditors as reviewers, the majority of the more than two dozen public companies reviewed by Reuters that have or had corporate integrity agreements - such as Pfizer, CVS Caremark and Eli Lilly - do not hire their own auditors and instead opt for consulting or law firms. HISTORY OF VIOLATIONS Pricewaterhouse's current dual clients for audits and compliance reviews include Novartis and Merck, according to the list provided by the health agency's inspector general.GlaxoSmithKline previously engaged its auditor, PwC, for a compliance review which ended in 2012.EY currently performs dual work for Sanofi and it previously did dual work for Allergan Inc. prior to its acquisition.GlaxoSmithKine, Novartis and Merck have all been involved in multiple settlements with the U.S. government since 1991 to resolve a range of criminal and civil claims, according to a recent report by the nonprofit watchdog Public Citizen. [ID: nL2N17122L]GlaxoSmithKline has paid nearly $8 billion in federal fines between 1991 and 2015 - the most of any drugmaker, according to the Public Citizen report.A GlaxoSmithKline spokeswoman said the company has greatly improved its compliance by taking steps such as eliminating payments to doctors who speak on the company's behalf and ending sales incentives based on prescription volumes.Novartis, in 2010, settled civil charges of paying kickbacks to doctors who spoke at corporate events, and signed a corporate integrity agreement.The company now faces another civil lawsuit filed by federal and state prosecutors, which alleges that kickbacks to doctors continued for nearly a year after it signed its 2010 corporate integrity agreement with the health agency's inspector general.Novartis has sought to dismiss the case, saying it makes ""sweeping"" allegations of a ""decade-long, nationwide fraudulent scheme based on just fifteen doctors.""

774,"   By Natalie Grover  Pfizer Inc's (PFE.N) experimental long-acting opioid painkiller has some abuse-resistant properties but addicts can still extract oxycodone from the drug using certain solvents, a preliminary review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration concluded on Monday.Pfizer is seeking approval to claim the drug, whose proposed trade name is Troxyca ER, deters abuse. It wants to market the drug for patients with pain severe enough to require around-the-clock treatment for whom other drugs are not enough. The review comes ahead of meeting on Wednesday of outside experts, who will discuss the drug and recommend whether it should be approved. The FDA is not obliged to follow the advice of its advisory panels but typically does.Troxyca ER contains oxycodone and naltrexone, a drug that negates the effect of oxycodone if the pellets are crushed. (1.usa.gov/1UCIQUI) Pfizer's morphine-based, long-acting painkiller Embeda uses a similar technology. The FDA approved Embeda with an abuse deterrent label in 2014.The FDA review said oxycodone could be extracted from Troxyca ER using multiple common solvents, some more easily than others. Pfizer states in its own briefing documents that oxycodone could only be uniquely extracted, without naltrexone, using one solvent.On Tuesday the panel will consider an abuse-resistant opioid made by Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (TEVA.TA) (TEVA.N), Vantrela ER. The FDA found the drug had abuse-deterrent properties when snorted or injected. The benefit was less clear when the product was swallowed. Studies showed that little oxycodone is released from heated Troxyca ER vapor, reducing the likelihood of abuse by those seeking to inhale it, the reviewers said.The abuse of opioids — a class of drugs that includes heroin and prescription painkillers — has reached epidemic proportions in the United States. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that 78 Americans die every day from opioid overdose. Last week officials in Minnesota determined that the April death of musician Prince was due to an accidental overdose of the synthetic opioid fentanyl.

Tuesday, July 5 10 a.m. - The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit will hear an appeal by Canadian drugmaker Apotex Inc of a decision by the U.S. Patent Trial and Appeal Board upholding the validity of a Pfizer Inc patent, which relates to the New York-based drugmaker's antibiotic Tygacil. Apotex has argued that the patent, which describes a formulation designed to make the active chemical tigecycline more stable, is obvious in light of prior art. The case is Apotex Inc v. Wyeth LLC, No. 15-1871. For Apotex: John Molenda of Steptoe & Johnson.

791,"  Pfizer Inc and German drugmaker Merck KGaA on Wednesday said they had begun a late-stage trial of their immuno-oncology drug avelumab in combination with standard treatment for ovarian cancer.The 950-patient study will enroll patients with advanced ovarian cancer who have not previously been treated for the disease, which is diagnosed annually in almost 23,000 American women and has a high mortality rate.  Avelumab is a so-called checkpoint inhibitor, which works by taking the brakes off the immune system.""The hope is that avelumab can change the natural history of the disease and potentially take the survival rate beyond the current five-year estimate,"" Alise Reicin, a senior research executive at Merck KGaA said in a statement. One group of patients in the Phase III study will receive avelumab in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy, the current standard of care. Others will receive chemotherapy alone, or avelumab a few weeks after receiving chemotherapy. Rival drugmakers Bristol-Myers Squibb Co and Merck & Co are developing similar checkpoint inhibitors for a range of cancers, but have not yet tested them alongside standard treatments in large trials of patients with previously untreated ovarian cancer.In one small early-stage study of Merck's Keytruda, tumor shrinkage was seen in 11.5 percent of patients with ovarian cancer, without significant safety issues. Ovarian tumors shrank by 15 percent among patients taking Bristol-Myers' Opdivo in a small trial.

792,"   By Michael Flaherty and Greg Roumeliotis  U.S. cancer drug company Medivation Inc MDVN.O said on Tuesday it had agreed to provide confidential information to French pharmaceutical company Sanofi SA (SASY.PA) as part of exploring a sale that would be open to other bidders. San Francisco-based Medivation shares jumped as much as 4.2 percent after Reuters first reported that Medivation and Sanofi were in talks over a confidentiality pact, adding to similar agreements Medivation has with Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) and Celgene Corp (CELG.O), which have also expressed interest in an acquisition.The move comes after Medivation rejected Sanofi's $9.3 billion offer in April, prompting Sanofi to embark on a campaign to convince Medivation shareholders to oust Medivation's board of directors and replace them with its nominees in a so-called written consent process. Medivation said on Tuesday it expected to provide each party interested in an acquisition the opportunity to review non-public information and meet with Medivation's management. Sanofi also agreed to withdraw its consent solicitation challenging Medivation's board and to enter into a six-month conditional standstill. Sanofi said it was confident that its due diligence can be  completed and that it could close a deal with Medivation quickly given that it had received U.S. regulatory clearance and there was no financing condition.Pfizer and Celgene did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Sanofi also said it had increased its offer from $52.50 per share to $58 per share in cash and $3 per share in the form of a contingent value right relating to Talazoparib sales performance. Talazoparib is a Medivation drug under development for the treatment of breast cancer. Medivation said it had turned down that new offer as well. Last month, shareholder advisory firm Glass Lewis & Co recommended that Medivation's shareholders should not support Sanofi's efforts to replace the company's board members.  Sanofi wants Medivation - which sells a successful prostate cancer drug called Xtandi - so Sanofi can expand in the lucrative oncology sector, as it seeks new businesses to compensate for flagging diabetes revenues.Medivation had previously argued that Sanofi's offer had failed to value fairly the prospects for Xtandi, as well as two other key products currently in clinical trials - Talazoparib and Pidilizumab, which is being developed for the treatment of blood cancers.

801,"  (Repeating for additional clients with no changes to text.)By Carl O'DonnellJuly 19 Some of the world's largest drug companies are taking out their checkbooks for acquisitions of smaller peers whose cancer drugs have the potential to cure not just patients, but corporate growth prospects as well.After decades in which progress meant extending life by weeks or months, new cancer treatments hold promise of adding years to patients' lives and billions of dollars in revenue to the companies that own them. Some of the most promising, known as immunotherapy, harness the body's own defense system to fight cancer.For many pharmaceutical companies, this wave of innovation couldn't have come at a better time. A generation of mainstay drugs have gone off patent, raising the stakes for companies vying for a foothold in the burgeoning oncology market.In recent months, executives at many big pharmaceutical companies have expressed interest in building cancer treatment portfolios through acquisitions.They range from well-established incumbents, such as Roche Holding AG and Amgen Inc, to relative outsiders, including Sanofi and Gilead, according to public statements from the companies and several sources familiar with the companies plans and who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media.Amgen declined to comment. Roche, Sanofi and Gilead did not respond to requests to comment.Among the most logical acquisition targets are Incyte Corporation and Seattle Genetics, which have respective market capitalizations of about $16 billion and $6 billion, said Michael King, a biotechnology analyst at JMP Securities.Incyte's blood cancer drug, Jakafi, produced more than $600 million in sales last year. Seattle Genetic's lymphoma drug, ADCETRIS, earned revenues of nearly $450 million. Both companies declined to comment.The acquisition of promising cancer drugs is ""going to be a major theme in the life sciences sector for the next several years,"" said Kennen MacKay, a biotechnology analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG.

804,"   By Chang-Ran Kim and Kate Holton | TOKYO/LONDON  TOKYO/LONDON Japan's SoftBank (9984.T) will buy Britain's most valuable technology company ARM ARM.L for $32 billion in cash, an audacious attempt to lead the next wave of digital innovation with a chip designer that powers the global mobile phone industry.Led by the charismatic Japanese investor, Masayoshi Son, SoftBank swooped on the Apple supplier ARM in the three weeks since Britain voted to leave the European Union, a result which stunned financial markets and has sent sterling down 11 percent against both the dollar and yen.While the drop has made British assets much cheaper for foreign investors, the chief of the telecoms and internet group  played down any suggestion that this was an opportunistic deal.Son said he had been following ARM for the last 10 years and decided now was the right time to invest in a firm that provides the technology in nearly all smartphones including Apple's (AAPL.O) iPhone and Samsung's (005930.KS) Galaxy. ARM is also poised to play a central role in the tech industry's shift to the 'internet of things' (IoT) - a network of devices, vehicles and building sensors that collect and exchange data - a stated focus for SoftBank founder and CEO Son.""ARM will be the center of the Internet of Things, in which everything will be connected,"" he told reporters. ""IoT is going to be the biggest paradigm shift in human history (and) we have always invested at the beginning of every paradigm shift."" The ARM deal is one of Japan's biggest overseas ventures and the latest in a parade of Japanese companies seeking growth abroad as the domestic economy stagnates.From a British point of view, the capital investment is so big that it covers approaching three months of the country's huge current account deficit, according to Kit Juckes, head of currency strategy at Societe Generale.It is SoftBank's largest takeover to date and marks a departure for a group whose tech and telecom portfolio ranges from U.S. carrier Sprint (S.N) to a stake in Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba (BABA.N) and humanoid robot 'Pepper' - but does not yet include a major presence in the semiconductor industry.    The deal will also mark a major change for the 26-year-old British firm based in Cambridge, eastern England, and which touts its independence as a reason why it can work with the rival players in the mobile industry.British politicians have objected in recent years to some international takeovers including Pfizer's (PFE.N) failed bid to buy AstraZeneca (AZN.L) and the successful move by Kraft to buy British chocolatier Cadbury.   But Son spoke to British Prime Minister Theresa May over the weekend and within minutes of SoftBank announcing the deal on Monday the government released a statement saying it showed Britain remained open for business. Uncertainty surrounding the vote to leave the EU in last month's referendum has raised fears that foreign investment, which is vital for covering the current account deficit, might fall. ARM Chief Executive Simon Segars told Reuters the board had been impressed with SoftBank's promise to increase jobs at ARM, its willingness to engage the British government, and the 43 percent premium the group was willing to pay.ARM shares surged 42 percent to 16.90 pounds by 1408 GMT.""SOFTBANK 2.0""  ""SoftBank's position as an entity outside the semiconductor industry allows ARM to retain its independence and protect existing customer relationships, while commitment to UK investment ensures management buy-in,"" Jefferies analysts said in a note. ""It's difficult to see other suitors at this stage.""   The acquisition is the first for Son, 58, since he last month rescinded plans to retire - effectively pushing out his heir apparent, former Google (GOOG.O) executive Nikesh Arora.Son, whose lucrative early investments include Alibaba, said then that he wanted to ""cement SoftBank 2.0"", turn around loss-making Sprint (S.N) and ""work on a few more crazy ideas"".Though he has a low profile outside Asia, Son has long been an unconventional visionary in the often closed and clubby world of corporate Japan, turning profits from Japanese telecoms into bets on up-and-coming start-ups.Not all have been a success: SoftBank's $22 billion acquisition of a controlling stake in Sprint in 2013 has left the group with hefty debts. But Son said on Monday his decision to move for ARM reflected his confidence that Sprint was close to turning around.     SoftBank had interest-bearing debt of 11.9 trillion yen  ($112.6 billion) at end-March, including 4 trillion yen at Sprint, and its net debt currently stands at 3.8 times core earnings.SoftBank has raised nearly 2 trillion yen in cash over the last few months through asset disposals, according to Son - including the sale of shares in China's Alibaba, unusual for a group that has rarely exited investments.But analysts had expected it to use the cash to reduce debt or give shareholders a windfall by buying back its own shares.Instead, Son appears to have leapt on the opportunity to buy ARM at a time when Britain was convulsed by the political and financial fall-out from the vote to leave the EU, which prompted sterling's fall to a 31-year low against the dollar.Though ARM has warned on the staffing impact of Brexit, its revenues are largely in dollars, and the weaker pound prompted its shares to climb almost 17 percent since the vote.Under the offer on Monday SoftBank said it was committed to keeping top managers, ARM's headquarters and to at least double the employee headcount in Britain.Analysts said on Monday that a counterbid was not impossible but also unlikely, as any rival bidder among ARM's customers or Chinese rivals could face regulatory challenges.SoftBank shares were not traded on Monday, a market holiday in Tokyo.Lazard and Goldman Sachs were the lead financial advisers to ARM while the Raine Group, Robey Warshaw and Mizuho Securities acted as financial advisers to SoftBank.

808,"   By Tatiana Bautzer and Guillermo Parra-Bernal | SAO PAULO  SAO PAULO Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd and Mylan NV have shown preliminary interest in a Brazilian generic drugmaking joint-venture in which Pfizer Inc has a 40 percent stake, two people familiar with the process said.India's Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd and three buyout firms are also eyeing the venture, Laboratório Teut|Pfizer, said the people, who asked for anonymity since the process is in early stages. Brazil's Melo family owns the remaining 60 percent of Teuto|Pfizer, Latin America's largest pharmaceutical plant.After agreeing to exit Teuto|Pfizer two months ago, the Melos and Pfizer hired the investment-banking units of Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Grupo BTG Pactual SA to oversee the plan, the people said. There is not yet a deadline for submitting proposals for Teuto|Pfizer, the people said.Teuto|Pfizer, in the centerwest Brazilian city of Anápolis, declined to comment, as did Pfizer. In an email to Reuters, Israeli generic drugs maker Teva said it would not comment on market rumors. Sun Pharmaceutical, UK-headquartered Mylan, Goldman Sachs and BTG Pactual did not have an immediate comment.The sale underscores the challenge facing generic drugmakers in Brazil, where a weaker currency has stoked raw materials costs and the harshest recession in eight decades has slowed sales. Pfizer will decide this year whether to globally exit generic drugs, after plans to buy rival Allergan Inc collapsed. Generic drug sales in Brazil, Latin America's largest economy, expanded 10 percent last year, slowing from 15 percent growth in 2014, industry data showed. Revenue from sales of generic drugs in Brazil topped 46 billion reais ($14 billion) last year.OPTION  The people declined to detail the price the Melos and Pfizer, the biggest U.S. drugmaker, want for Teuto. Pfizer paid $240 million for the Teuto stake six years ago, to enter Brazil's then-buoyant generic drug market.At the time, Walderci de Melo, who bought Teuto in 1986 with his brother Lucimar, negotiated terms of an option that gave Pfizer the right to acquire the remainder of Teuto|Pfizer at 14.4 times operational profit between 2014 and 2016, one of the people said.However, Pfizer's potential exit from generic drugs and disagreements with the Melos over strategy got in the way of a deal, the people said. Bets similar to those that Pfizer made in Brazil, the world's third-largest market for the segment, have yielded mixed results, according to industry analysts.For instance, France's Sanofi SA has had to record  charges related to the booking of excess inventory at Medley Indústria Farmacêutica Ltda, for which it paid $660 million in 2009.

Sales in Eylea, the drug jointly developed with Regeneron (REGN.O) which helps stem the loss of vision in the elderly, also exceed the market view.But Bayer also became the latest maker of farming supplies to take a hit as depressed prices of agricultural produce such as wheat and corn have prompted growers to reduce pesticide use to a minimum.

Heart drug Brilinta and Farxiga for diabetes also did well.Quarterly core earnings per share, which exclude some items, fell 31 percent to 83 cents as revenue slid 11 percent to $5.60 billion, following the arrival of the first copies of Crestor in the United States in May.Industry analysts had on average forecast quarterly revenue of $5.58 billion and earnings of 84 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters. The British company said it continued to expect a low to mid single-digit percentage decline in both revenue and core earnings at constant exchange rates for the full year.In addition to falling sales of Crestor and other older drugs like Nexium, AstraZeneca also has to deal with a slump in U.S. revenue this year from its nasal spray flu vaccine Flumist, after health officials decided it was not worth using.IMMUNO-ONCOLOGY  Chief Executive Pascal Soriot, who saw off a takeover attempt by Pfizer in 2014, is looking beyond current problems and believes AstraZeneca can become a major player in cancer treatment by developing drugs that bolster the immune system and others that disrupt DNA repair mechanisms used by tumor cells.He said he was particularly encouraged by rapid patient recruitment in immuno-oncology combination drug trials, which are expected to produce make-or-break clinical results in the first half of next year.""Over the next 12 months the profile of this company will change,"" Soriot told reporters. ""We will start getting very serious proof points and hopefully people will see that our plan is working.""

816,"  LONDON, July 28 AstraZeneca declined to comment on Thursday on whether the drugmaker could become a takeover target once more, two years after it saw off a bid from Pfizer.This time speculation has moved to the idea of a possible offer from Swiss-based Novartis, which would increase its cancer drug operations significantly by acquiring its smaller British rival.Citi analyst Andrew Baum suggested in a note this week that AstraZeneca's biotech expertise and advanced immunotherapy cancer pipeline made it an attractive target for the Basel-based group.AstraZeneca has a market value of around $78 billion, against Novartis' $217 billion. Asked about the idea in a post-results media call, AstraZeneca Chief Executive Pascal Soriot said: ""We never comment on speculation or rumours or theories. A number of people will have those assumptions but we do not comment on those."" Novartis has substantial financial firepower and its CEO Joe Jimenez said last week he was ready to see the group's AA- credit rating decline for the right M&A opportunity, though he also said he did not feel any pressure to do deals in the immunotherapy field.One question-mark surrounding any potential move to acquire AstraZeneca is the stance of the British government, since new Prime Minister Theresa May has talked about developing a new industrial strategy, which could include defending important UK sectors such as pharmaceuticals. AstraZeneca itself has made a number of bolt-on acquisitions to improve its new-drug pipeline in the past couple of years, although Soriot said this process was now effectively complete.""We have a really full pipeline, so we would be extremely unlikely to consider a pipeline acquisition,"" he said. ""What we are looking to potentially do is acquisitions that are earnings accretive and are strategically aligned to our focus areas.""

826,"  WASHINGTON A U.S. advisory panel on Thursday recommended approval of Egalet Corp's long-acting opioid painkiller, Arymo ER, saying it dulls pain and could deter abuse by addicts seeking a quick high.The panel recommended that the Food and Drug Administration (FAD) approve the drug and said it deters, but does not eliminate, the risk of abuse if addicts try to snort, chew or inject it.The FDA is not obliged to follow the recommendations of its advisory committees but typically does so.Addicts frequently attempt to increase the speed with which opioids get into their bloodstream by chewing or crushing the pills, or by dissolving and injecting them. Egalet's tablets are designed to be extremely hard, making them more difficult to break down to extract the active ingredient. If brought in contact with liquid they turn into a sticky gel difficult to inject with a syringe.In June a panel recommended approval of a long-acting, abuse-deterrent opioid made by Pfizer Inc though it had reservations about the drug's ability to curb all forms of abuse. The panel also recommended approval of a long-acting opioid made by Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd and said it was likely to deter abuse whether addicts sought to swallow, snort or inject it. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 78 Americans die every day from opioid overdose.

827,"   By Nate Raymond | NEW YORK  NEW YORK A Long Island investment adviser and a former partner at a major law firm have been indicted on charges that they engaged in insider trading ahead of Pfizer Inc's acquisition of King Pharmaceuticals Inc in 2010, prosecutors said on Wednesday.Tibor Klein, who owned advisory firm Klein Financial Services, and Robert Schulman, a Washington, D.C., patent lawyer who at the time was with the law firm Hunton & Williams, were charged in an indictment filed in Central Islip, New York.Prosecutors said Klein, who lives in Melville, New York, learned about the planned $3.6 billion merger from Schulman, who had been representing King Pharmaceuticals in patent litigation since 2009.Prosecutors said that on the basis of Schulman's tip, Klein bought stock in King on behalf of himself, Schulman and his advisory clients, enabling them to make a combined $300,000 in profits when the deal was announced.Klein had also tipped a broker in Florida about the expected merger, who traded on the information and split the more than $100,000 in profits he made with Klein, prosecutors said. Prosecutors did not name the broker, but an earlier U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit identified him as Michael Shechtman, a former Ameriprise Financial Inc stockbroker and friend of Klein's.Shechtman pleaded guilty in November 2014 to conspiracy to commit securities fraud in connection with the case.Both Klein, 43, and Schulman, 58, were arrested on charges of conspiracy and securities fraud and are expected to appear later on Wednesday in federal courts in Central Islip and Alexandria, Virginia, respectively. ""We are extremely disappointed by the government's decision to charge Mr. Klein,"" said Christopher Bruno, his lawyer. ""Mr. Klein intends to vigorously defend these charges at trial.""Christopher Mead, Schulman's attorney, in an email said the ""evidence at trial will show that my client is innocent.""The indictment followed an earlier civil lawsuit in 2013 by the SEC against Klein and Shechtman over the same trades. The criminal case, though, differs in terms of the SEC's lawsuit by alleging that Schulman, who was most recently a partner at the law firm Arent Fox, intentionally tipped Klein.The SEC had by contrast alleged that Klein misappropriated the information from Schulman, who during an August 2010 meal at his home after several glasses of wine became intoxicated and blurted out, ""It would be nice to be King for a day.""The case is U.S. v.

The drug's patent will lapse in September 2018.

Biosimilars are lower-cost copies of complex biotech drugs. J&J, which is also defending other Remicade patents, said it plans to appeal the latest court decision.""Assuming biosimilar competition, we think Remicade revenues will decline by just over $1 billion in 2017, costing J&J close to $0.20 in EPS,"" J.P.

836,"  (Adds detail on the deal, background to the companies)By Greg RoumeliotisAug 21 Pfizer Inc is in advanced talks to acquire U.S. cancer drug company Medivation Inc for close to $14 billion, as it seeks to boost its oncology portfolio, people familiar with the matter said on Sunday.Pfizer has agreed to pay a little more than $80 per share for Medivation, one of the people said, a substantial premium to the $52.50 offer for Medivation that France's Sanofi SA  made in April, which eventually resulted in the company putting itself up for sale. Medivation shares ended trading in New York on Friday at $67.16.Reuters reported earlier this week that Pfizer, Sanofi, Merck & Co Inc, Celgene Corp and Gilead Sciences Inc had submitted expressions of interest to acquire Medivation. The strong acquisition interest in the San Francisco-based company illustrates how demand for new cancer treatments, which can possibly add years to patients' lives, could spell billions of dollars in revenue to the companies that own them.Pfizer has so far prevailed in the auction for Medivation and could announce a deal as early as Monday, although the negotiations still could fall apart at the last minute, the people said. The deal is expected to be paid for by Pfizer in its entirety, or at least mostly, with cash, one of the people said. The sources asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential. Pfizer and Medivation declined to comment. The Financial Times first reported on Pfizer nearing a deal for Medivation on Sunday.Pfizer, whose oncology offerings include breast cancer drug Ibrance and several other promising immuno-oncology products, is now set to get access to Medivation's successful prostate cancer drug Xtandi, as well as Talazoparib, another breast cancer treatment under development by Medivation. Medivation earlier this year rejected two acquisition offers from Sanofi, the latest for $58 per share in cash and $3 per share in the form of a contingent value right relating to the sales performance of Talazoparib.However, Medivation agreed in July to share confidential information with potential buyers after Sanofi agreed to drop a campaign to oust Medivation's board of directors.In its second-quarter earnings call earlier this month, Medivation reported continued double-digit year-over-year growth for Xtandi, affirming the company's expectations of more than 50 percent revenue growth for the year.Medivation also cited positive late-stage data for Talazoparib, a drug the company believes will account for a significant part of its long-term value.

838,"   By Ransdell Pierson and Ankur Banerjee  Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), beating out numerous other bidders, said it agreed to buy U.S. cancer drug company Medivation Inc MDVN.O for $14 billion in cash, adding its blockbuster prostate cancer drug Xtandi to the company's growing oncology roster.Medivation shares jumped nearly 20 percent to close at $80.42, just shy of the offer price of $81.50 per share. Shares of Pfizer, the largest U.S. drugmaker, were down 0.4 percent at $34.84. The offer is a 55-percent premium to Sanofi SA's (SASY.PA) initial bid to buy Medivation for $52.50 per share in April, which pushed the San Francisco-based company to put itself up for sale. It represents a 118-percent increase since Reuters reported on March 30 that Medivation had hired JP Morgan to handle interest from companies in a potential acquisition.   The planned purchase of Medivation, with its $2.2 billion-a-year Xtandi, is the latest in a number of deals by large drugmakers willing to pay top dollar for cancer drugs that are more effective than standard, older treatments. Perhaps the most notable example is AbbVie Inc's (ABBV.N) $21 billion purchase last year of Pharmacyclics. The deal gave AbbVie shared ownership with Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) in the blockbuster leukemia drug Imbruvica.Analysts predicted the deal would not raise antitrust concerns because Pfizer does not currently sell a prostate cancer drug aside from generics.  Pfizer said its earnings would increase immediately after buying Medivation. The deal comes four months after Pfizer and Ireland-based Allergan Plc (AGN.N) scrapped their $160 billion merger. Pfizer has since bought Anacor Pharmaceuticals Inc in a $5.2 billion deal to add an eczema gel to its portfolio.The Medivation deal illustrates a shift in Pfizer's M&A strategy from lowering taxes - the rationale behind the failed Allergan tax inversion deal - to strengthening its lineup of branded drugs, especially lucrative cancer treatments.Pfizer, in a conference call with analysts, said it still plans to decide by year-end whether to split into separate companies selling either low-growth generics or patent-protected brand medicines.  ""The Medivation deal increases the likelihood of a split,"" said SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst John Boris. But, he said, Pfizer would likely first try to buy other drugmakers or their best assets in order to further strengthen its branded-drug portfolio.A year ago, Pfizer paid $15 billion for Hospira, which sells generic hospital products and is developing biosimilars meant to compete with big-selling injectable biotech drugs. That deal was seen by Wall Street as a way of bolstering its generic drugs ahead of potentially divesting the business. Pfizer's biggest growth driver is a new breast cancer drug called Ibrance. The company is also trying to catch up with Merck & Co (MRK.N) and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (BMY.N) in developing immuno-oncology drugs that work by taking the brakes off the immune system to fight cancers.Pfizer Chief Executive Ian Read told analysts the Medivation deal was mainly driven by the desire to obtain Xtandi, although he expressed high hopes for talazoparib and pidilizumab, experimental Medivation drugs for breast cancer and lymphoma, respectively.Xtandi generated U.S. net sales of $330.3 million in the second quarter. Japanese drugmaker Astellas Pharma Inc (4503.T) owns the rights to sell Xtandi outside the United States, where it generated sales of $240 million in the period. Read said Xtandi, which was approved four years ago to treat men who had failed to benefit from prostate cancer treatments, could capture far greater sales if it is eventually approved for earlier use and is prescribed by urologists.""The product is just at the beginning of its growth cycle,"" Read predicted. Some analysts, including BMO's Alex Arfaei, said Pfizer appeared to be overpaying for Medivation. But Piper Jaffray analyst Richard Purkiss said the price is not excessive given Xtandi's potential for earlier treatment in coming years.Reuters had reported that Pfizer, Merck, Celgene Corp (CELG.O) and Gilead Sciences Inc (GILD.O) had submitted expressions of interest to buy Medivation.   ""Given the already very high price being discussed, the difficult public relationship between Medivation and Sanofi ...  we see a higher bid as very unlikely, but not impossible,"" RBC Capital Partners wrote in a client note ahead of the announcement.     Sanofi said while it recognized the potential strategic benefits of a combination with Medivation, it was a ""disciplined acquirer and remained committed to acting in the best interests of Sanofi shareholders."" Pfizer said the deal was approved by boards of both companies and should be completed in the third or fourth quarter.Shares of other cancer drug companies, including Incyte Corp (INCY.O) and Seattle Genetics (SGEN.O), also rose on Monday, as investors speculated about  more dealmaking in the sector. Pfizer's financial advisers were Guggenheim Securities and Centerview Partners, with Ropes & Gray LLP providing legal counsel. J.P. Morgan Securities and Evercore were Medivation's financial advisers, while Cooley LLP and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz served as its legal advisers.

851,"   By Ransdell Pierson  Pfizer Inc's chief executive on Thursday said recent proposals by Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton to curb ""unjustified"" U.S. drug prices would dampen investment in innovative new drugs and ultimately hurt consumers.""(They) would be very negative for innovation,"" Ian Read said in webcast from the annual Wells Fargo healthcare conference in Boston. He said Clinton's proposals, if ever approved, would be a step toward a one-payer government system of price controls on prescription medicines.Critics of the pharmaceutical industry have long argued that drugmakers unfairly raise prices at will, making their products increasingly less accessible to patients. Drugmakers counter that it can cost $1 billion dollars or more to develop the typical drug and say they need to be reimbursed for the costs and risk-taking.Read said he did not believe price controls like those seen in Europe would occur in the United States. ""A lot depends on the composition of the Senate and House,"" he added, referring to whether Republicans continue to dominate at least one branch of Congress and can be a counterweight to a potential Clinton White House. Clinton last week said that if elected to the White House she would create an oversight panel to protect U.S. consumers from large price hikes on long-available, lifesaving drugs and to import alternative treatments if necessary, adding to her pledges to rein in overall drug prices.She said the oversight panel would be able to levy fines and impose penalties on manufacturers when there has been an unjustified ""outlier"" price increase on a long-available or generic drug, meaning an especially high increase. Clinton cited Turing Pharmaceuticals LLC's 5,000 percent price increase for AIDS drug Daraprim and Mylan NV’s repeated steep price increases on its EpiPen device for severe allergy sufferers as troubling examples of price hikes that have attracted bipartisan congressional scrutiny.Read on Thursday said patients are increasingly confused about actual drug prices because pharmacy benefit managers require drugmakers to pay ever-higher, typically confidential, rebates to get their drugs on insurance company formularies. Moreover, drugstores and distributors also take their cut of profit.  He predicted pharmaceutical companies and such intermediaries will eventually agree to modify the system to make pricing more transparent.Brent Saunders, chief executive of Allergan Inc, on Wednesday also faulted Clinton's proposals, saying in a free market it would be difficult for an oversight panel to determine fair prices.

855,"   By Natalie Grover and Toni Clarke  Pfizer Inc's (PFE.N) trial data on Chantix, a drug to help people quit smoking, failed to impress U.S. Food and Drug Administration scientists, in a blow to the company's attempts to have a serious warning removed from the drug's label. The FDA staff, in a preliminary review, expressed concerns about the collection and interpretation of data from a post-marketing study on the controversial drug. Pfizer has been trying to have the ""black box"" warning - which warns of psychiatric risks including suicidal thoughts, hostility and agitation - removed from the drug's label.  In March 2015, the FDA left the warning on the label, following the recommendation of an advisory committee to wait for the outcome of the study in more than 8,000 adult smokers.Results from the study, which compared Chantix or GlaxoSmithKline Plc's (GSK.L) Zyban with a placebo or a nicotine patch in smokers with and without a history of psychiatric disorders, showed that the drug did not significantly increase the incidence of serious neuropsychiatric side-effects.  However, FDA staff disputed the results, flagging inconsistencies in data collection and characterization of the severity of some side-effects. These factors could have led to biased results, they said, ahead of a meeting of independent advisers on Wednesday.The advisers will discuss the trial findings and decide whether the warning should be removed. The FDA is not obligated to follow the panel's recommendations, but it usually does. James Rusnak, chief development officer of Pfizer's cardiovascular metabolic unit, said there were bound to be variations in investigators' judgment within the boundaries of the trial protocol, just like in the case of doctors in clinical practice.""Ultimately, what was reported as an adverse event, was determined based upon the investigator's local determination of the subject presenting in front of them,"" he said.Any subjectivity in investigator's judgment would be spread across the four treatment groups and not be limited to Chantix, Rusnak noted.  In May, European regulators lifted a warning on the drug, sold under the brand name Champix in Europe, based on the results of a large study.Investors were betting big on the drug when Pfizer launched it in 2006, but reports of mental health problems in users led to the FDA imposing the black box warning three years later.

863,"   By Carl O'Donnell  Allergan Plc (AGN.N) CEO Brent Saunders calls them ""stepping stones"" - small, bolt-on acquisitions, as opposed to the mega-deals common in the drug industry. And they're expected to boost dealmaking in sectors ranging from neurology to skin care.Allergan's agreement on Tuesday to acquire liver drug developer Tobira Therapeutics Inc (TBRA.O) for $1.7 billion may seem trivial compared to the proposed $160 billion deal Allergan crafted last year to sell itself to Pfizer Inc (PFE.N).But that deal was torpedoed in April by the U.S. Treasury's latest curbs on tax inversions. Now the company, domiciled in Ireland, is taking a new tack, preparing to spend a war chest of more than $20 billion on stepping-stone deals. The small deals are aimed at filling gaps in its core therapeutic areas, which range from the central nervous system and gastrointestinal diseases, to dermatology and eye care.Allergan has added four other small companies to its portfolio this year, three of which sold for less than $100 million upfront, plus performance payments. Two, ForSight Vision and Retrosense Therapeutics, treat eye disorders. The others, Topokine Therapeutics and Vitae Pharmaceuticals Inc. VTAE.O, focus on dermatology. Allergan agreed to acquire Vitae last week for $639 million.The fact that Allergan is paying top dollar for some of these companies - including a nearly 600 percent premium for Tobira, excluding performance payments - has investors and dealmakers speculating about the company's next stepping stone.Logical acquisition targets for Allergan would include Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc (ACAD.O), a maker of treatments for Parkinson’s disease; Intra-Cellular Therapies Inc (ITCI.O), a developer of psychiatric medications; Neurocrine Biosciences Inc (NBIX.O), which focuses on neurology and women’s health; and Dermira Inc (DERM.O), a dermatology company, according to investment bankers and industry investors. In an interview with Reuters, Saunders declined to comment on any specific companies that Allergan may want to acquire next. But he said that stepping stones will play a key role in helping the company continue to meet its ambitious annual revenue growth target of 10 percent for years to come. ""I needed to do big deals to get where we are, but the strategic vision was always to get to a point where we could use stepping stones,"" Saunders said. 	 Allergan has relied heavily on M&A because it views inventing its own drugs in-house as too risky. Saunders, 46, has attempted or executed mergers and acquisitions totaling more than $300 billion in the last three years. Allergan now has the money to embark on a major acquisition spree thanks to the sale of its generic drug portfolio to Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (TEVA.TA). Allergan received $33.4 billion in cash and $5.1 billion in Teva stock last month as a result of that deal. While Allergan has pledged to spend some of those dollars on share buybacks, it will still have cash reserves of more than $20 billion it can spend on deals.	Allergan wants to build out its central nervous system franchise, which is one of the largest in the industry and treats diseases including Alzheimer's, depression, migraines and schizophrenia, Saunders said.     He added that he would like to branch out into other types of neurological treatments, including multiple sclerosis, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and Parkinson's disease.     One of Allergan's successful endeavors in the central nervous system space, its Namenda Alzheimer's franchise, took a hit over the past year after one of its key drugs, Namenda IR, lost patent protection. Namenda IR generated more than $500 million in 2015.   Allergan is hoping that a ramp-up of its newly commercialized anti-psychotic drug, Vraylar, can help offset that decline.BOTOX AS A GATEWAY DRUG Saunders said he also is optimistic about opportunities in dermatology and eye care, adding that he would be open to a medium-sized deal to build out its opthalmic products.      In dermatology, Allergan has the world's biggest franchise by sales, largely due to its flagship drug, Botox, for wrinkle-smoothing.Last year, in a stepping-stone acquisition, Allergan bought a publicly traded dermatology company called Kythera for $2.1 billion, and it has been ramping up sales of its key drug, Kybella, which treats double chins.""There's definitely potential for more deals like that in dermatology,"" said Randall Stanicky, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. ""Botox is a gateway product into the entire world of aesthetics.""In the interview, Saunders left open the possibility of a transformative acquisition or merger for Allergan, which has a market capitalization of $95 billion.He said a company with a cutting-edge treatment that reversed Alzheimer's was an example of the type of big deal Allergan would consider making.    Biogen Inc BIIB.N and Eli Lilly and Co (LLY.N) both have late stage drugs that promise to reverse the effects of the degenerative neurological disease. Biogen and Eli Lilly have market capitalizations of $65 billion and $86 billion, respectively.Reuters reported in August that Allergan had held informal conversations with some members of Biogen's board before deciding against any acquisition offer.

866,"   By Ransdell Pierson and Bill Berkrot | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), which was considering splitting itself for more than two years, said on Monday it would not do so, prompting shareholders to expect more deals that could bolster its roster of new medicines.  The largest U.S. drugmaker said its lengthy analysis determined that splitting off its low-growth generics from its patent-protected branded products would not boost cash flow or better position the businesses competitively. The move would also disrupt operations, have inherent costs and fail to deliver any tax efficiencies, the company said.""I never saw the logic behind a split-up,"" said portfolio manager Les Funtleyder of E Squared Asset Management, which owns Pfizer shares. Buying and developing new drugs in oncology and other therapeutic areas is the key to growth for the company, he said. ""We'd rather see them do some bolt-ons in the $1-to-$10-billion range, which are easily doable for Pfizer,"" he said. Pfizer will keep the generics and branded medicines as separate divisions, saying it retains the option to split later if ""factors materially change at some point in the future.""Portfolio manager Jeff Jonas of Gabelli Funds, which holds Pfizer shares, said he expected to see deals that could add future branded products, particularly in the highly lucrative oncology area. He cited the recent success of Pfizer's internally developed Ibrance breast cancer drug. Jonas expects Pfizer to follow its decision to buy Medivation Inc MDVN.O for $14 billion with more deals of ""that size or smaller."" It bought Medivation for its blockbuster prostate cancer drug Xtandi. Pfizer's $160 billion deal to buy Irish drugmaker Allergan Inc (AGN.N) collapsed in April after a change in U.S. law had negated the tax benefits for companies moving corporate headquarters overseas. Investors said they did not believe Pfizer's current strategy includes any Allergan-sized deals. Pfizer said the decision against a split would not affect its 2016 financial forecast. Its shares were down 2.1 percent at $33.55 in afternoon trading, amid a 1.5 percent decline in the ARCA Pharmaceutical Index of large drugmakers .DRG.Investors had been expecting the company to step back from the split, Sanford Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson said in a research note. Pfizer began openly planning for a possible split in early 2014, saying it would track the two divisions' progress for three years before reaching a decision. In August, it said it would decide by year-end. The company had considered the split largely because its patent-protected medicines routinely enjoyed sales growth while demand for its generics typically declined.However, Pfizer's $15 billion purchase of Hospira a year ago bolstered the company's wide array of generics, such as the once top-selling cholesterol drug Lipitor. Hospira makes generic injectable hospital products and biosimilars, which are cheaper versions of the world's leading biotech drugs.  Annual sales of Pfizer's generic portfolio should grow by a  single-digit percentage rate in coming years, JPMorgan analyst Chris Schott said in a research note. He forecast a 3 percent rise in the company's overall annual sales through 2020, resulting in 8 percent earnings growth.

872,"   By Ransdell Pierson and Bill Berkrot | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), which was considering splitting itself for more than two years, said on Monday it would not do so, prompting shareholders to expect more deals that could bolster its roster of new medicines.  The largest U.S. drugmaker said its lengthy analysis determined that splitting off its low-growth generics from its patent-protected branded products would not boost cash flow or better position the businesses competitively. The move would also disrupt operations, have inherent costs and fail to deliver any tax efficiencies, the company said.""I never saw the logic behind a split-up,"" said portfolio manager Les Funtleyder of E Squared Asset Management, which owns Pfizer shares. Buying and developing new drugs in oncology and other therapeutic areas is the key to growth for the company, he said. ""We'd rather see them do some bolt-ons in the $1-to-$10-billion range, which are easily doable for Pfizer,"" he said. Pfizer will keep the generics and branded medicines as separate divisions, saying it retains the option to split later if ""factors materially change at some point in the future.""Portfolio manager Jeff Jonas of Gabelli Funds, which holds Pfizer shares, said he expected to see deals that could add future branded products, particularly in the highly lucrative oncology area. He cited the recent success of Pfizer's internally developed Ibrance breast cancer drug. Jonas expects Pfizer to follow its decision to buy Medivation Inc MDVN.O for $14 billion with more deals of ""that size or smaller."" It bought Medivation for its blockbuster prostate cancer drug Xtandi. Pfizer's $160 billion deal to buy Irish drugmaker Allergan Inc (AGN.N) collapsed in April after a change in U.S. law had negated the tax benefits for companies moving corporate headquarters overseas. Investors said they did not believe Pfizer's current strategy includes any Allergan-sized deals. Pfizer said the decision against a split would not affect its 2016 financial forecast. Its shares were down 2.1 percent at $33.55 in afternoon trading, amid a 1.5 percent decline in the ARCA Pharmaceutical Index of large drugmakers .DRG.Investors had been expecting the company to step back from the split, Sanford Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson said in a research note. Pfizer began openly planning for a possible split in early 2014, saying it would track the two divisions' progress for three years before reaching a decision. In August, it said it would decide by year-end. The company had considered the split largely because its patent-protected medicines routinely enjoyed sales growth while demand for its generics typically declined.However, Pfizer's $15 billion purchase of Hospira a year ago bolstered the company's wide array of generics, such as the once top-selling cholesterol drug Lipitor. Hospira makes generic injectable hospital products and biosimilars, which are cheaper versions of the world's leading biotech drugs.  Annual sales of Pfizer's generic portfolio should grow by a  single-digit percentage rate in coming years, JPMorgan analyst Chris Schott said in a research note. He forecast a 3 percent rise in the company's overall annual sales through 2020, resulting in 8 percent earnings growth.

""ICU has been building a war chest for acquisitions and finally delivered on the M&A front,"" Lewis said.Pfizer spokeswoman Joan Campion said on Thursday the drugmaker had determined that more value could be extracted from the Hospira products ""outside of Pfizer,"" and that Pfizer's stake would allow it to profit from the smaller company's future growth.The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2017, the companies said.

The biggest part of Hospira's business is sterile injectables, such as antibiotics and pain medicines preloaded into syringes.

884,"   By Ben Hirschler | COPENHAGEN  COPENHAGEN An experimental Novartis pill given with an older drug kept advanced breast cancer in check far longer than standard treatment alone, putting it on track to challenge Pfizer's blockbuster Ibrance, data showed on Saturday.Patients taking ribociclib with letrozole were 44 percent less likely to see their disease progress or to die, a keenly awaited clinical trial found.Novartis' ribociclib works in a similar way to Ibrance and is set to be second to market in the category. It is expected to go on sale next year, ahead of Eli Lilly's rival abemaciclib.Ibrance has been quickly adopted by oncologists and is tipped by analysts to sell some $2.1 billion in 2016, according to Thomson Reuters consensus forecasts.The 44 percent reduction in progression-free survival seen with ribociclib, which is also known as LEE011, compared with a 42 percent fall reported in a comparable late-stage trial involving Ibrance.Lead researcher Gabriel Hortobagyi of the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston said the two drugs appeared very similar both in terms of their efficacy and side effects. ""This is a practice-changing study and when it (ribociclib) is approved by the appropriate regulatory agencies it will be one of the major choices,"" he told reporters. The news may prompt industry analysts to increase sales forecasts for the drug. Currently, consensus forecasts for ribociclib are $1 billion in 2021 against $5.8 billion for Ibrance.Alessandro Riva, head of cancer drug development at Novartis, told Reuters he believed the data showed that ribociclib was ""at least as good"" as Ibrance. Like Ibrance, ribociclib caused a decline in white blood cells. The Novartis drug was also associated with signals of potential liver and heart problems, although these issues were well managed. ""The addition of ribociclib to letrozole does increase the rate of toxicity, but overall, if we evaluate the magnitude of clinical benefit, there is definitely a benefit to be gained from adding ribociclib,"" said Giuseppe Curigliano of the European Institute of Oncology.Novartis announced in May that the 668-patient trial was a success but full details were only unveiled in Copenhagen at the annual European Society for Medical Oncology congress. They were also published online in the New England Journal of Medicine.Patients on letrozole alone went a median 14.7 months before their disease progressed, while the median point was not reached in the ribociclib combination arm because so many of those patients remained healthy.  The number of deaths in the study was also too low to allow researchers to calculate an impact on overall survival.In August, Novartis won breakthrough therapy designation from U.S. regulators for ribociclib as a first-line treatment for advanced breast cancer and the company plans to file the medicine for approval worldwide this year.Like Pfizer's Ibrance, which has a U.S. list price of around $10,000 a month, ribociclib blocks enzymes known as cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6.Both drugs are designed for patients whose tumors grow in response to estrogen and whose cancer is not caused by the HER2 protein. This is the most common type of breast cancer.

889,"   By David Morgan | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The Obama administration, in its latest bid to prevent American companies from minimizing U.S. taxes by rebasing abroad, issued final rules on Thursday to combat a key tax-reduction technique known as earnings stripping.Six months after proposing the regulations, the U.S. Treasury made good on its pledge to move swiftly against corporate tax inversions by rolling out the new final rule, despite opposition from business groups and from Republicans in Congress who demanded a delay only last week.""For years, this administration consistently has called for comprehensive business tax reform to fix our broken tax system,"" Treasury Secretary Jack Lew told reporters. ""In the absence of congressional action, however, it is Treasury’s responsibility to use our authority to protect the tax base.""Business lobbyists said the rules would likely be challenged in court.Tax inversions occur when a U.S. company is acquired by a smaller foreign business from a low-tax country and adopts its domicile to reduce the combined firm's overall U.S. tax burden. Inversions have occurred since the 1980s, but a new wave in recent years prompted the Treasury to take a series of actions including Thursday's final regulations, which were unveiled in April as part of a package that led to the collapse of a $160 billion merger deal between U.S. drugmaker Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) and Ireland's Allergan Plc (AGN.N).Treasury also imposed a temporary rule in April to prevent foreign companies from engaging in serial inversions. That is expected to be finalized later this year.   Earnings stripping occurs when the U.S. subsidiary of a newly inverted company avoids taxes on domestic operations by sending them overseas as tax-deductable interest payments. The newly finalized regulations would reclassify some forms of debt as equity, changing tax-exempt interest payments into dividends that are taxed.Business groups including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce have warned that the regulations could harm the cash management operations of U.S.-based multinationals and pose damaging unintended consequences for a range of businesses by creating mountains of red tape. But Treasury officials said the final rules addressed those concerns by granting exemptions for regulated financial and insurance firms, cash pooling, short-term debt, transactions between the foreign units of U.S. companies, stock acquisitions for employee compensation plans and other operations.The regulation also relaxed requirements for companies to document intercompany loans and delayed the documentation deadline for a year to Jan. 1, 2018.

890,"  LONDON Pfizer suffered a setback in Britain on Thursday when the Court of Appeal in London ruled against it in a patent case over the use of its $5 billion-a-year drug Lyrica for pain relief.Pfizer said it was disappointed by the decision and would seek a further appeal.Lyrica, known generically as pregabalin, was originally developed for epilepsy. However, further research showed it could also help patients suffering from neuropathic pain and most prescriptions are now written for pain.While the original patent on pregabalin has expired, Pfizer was awarded a secondary patent covering pain, valid until July 2017, and the U.S. drugmaker had been fighting to protect this lucrative section of the market. The expiry of the basic patent allowed generic drugmakers including Actavis, now renamed Allergan, to launch cut-price versions of the medicine, which carried a ""skinny label"" limiting their use to epilepsy and general anxiety disorder. But Pfizer still sued, arguing it was inevitable that the copycat versions would be dispensed for pain as well as other conditions. The court of appeal ruling endorsed an initial 2015 verdict that generic companies had not infringed Pfizer's secondary patent and its patent claims directed generally to pain and neuropathic pain were invalid.

It controls Latin America's largest generic drugs plant.A sale could bring between 1 billion reais and 1.5 billion reais ($317 million and $475 million), they said.The people, who requested anonymity because the process remains private, said that Bain, Advent and Torrent have to put forward binding offers for Teuto|Pfizer by November. Reuters reported on July 26 that Pfizer and Brazil's Melo family, which owns 60 percent of the venture, had put the company up for sale. Teuto|Pfizer had initially been offered to Teva, Sun and Mylan NV, the report said.Teuto|Pfizer, in the center west Brazilian city of Anápolis, declined to comment, as did Pfizer, Advent, Bain and Torrent. The sale underscores the challenge facing generic drugmakers in Brazil, where the harshest recession in eight decades has slowed sales of medicines.

907,"   By Ransdell Pierson  Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (BMY.N), whose high-profile Opdivo immunotherapy failed an important lung-cancer trial last summer, sharply raised its 2016 profit forecast after strong quarterly sales of other leading medicines.The U.S. drugmaker on Thursday predicted 2016 earnings of $2.80 to $2.90 a share, up from its previous forecast range of $2.55 to $2.65. Bristol-Myers, whose shares rose 5 percent in premarket trading, said it expects 2017 earnings of $2.85 to $3.05 per share.Sales of Opdivo, which treats melanoma and lung cancer, tripled to $920 million in the third quarter, but trailed forecasts by $27 million.    Opdivo had been considered the leader among a new class of cancer drugs called PD-1 inhibitors until August, when researchers said it failed to slow progression of symptoms in previously untreated patients with advanced lung cancer.Making matters worse for Opdivo, researchers earlier this month said Merck's rival Keytruda prolonged the life of similar patients, and on Monday, it became the first of new immunotherapy drugs approved in the United States for initial lung cancer treatment. The company said it authorized a new $3 billion share repurchase program, in addition to the $1.1 billion remaining under an authorization in 2012. And it predicted flat operating expenses through 2020, which analysts said should help profit margins.""We believe today's updates should begin to address Wall Street concerns on Bristol's near-term earnings outlook"" in the wake of Opdivo's setbacks, JP Morgan analyst Chris Schott said in a research note.Sales of Yervoy, an older melanoma treatment, jumped 19 percent to $285 million, $45 million above expectations, while sales of leukemia treatment Sprycel grew 15 percent to $472 million, $25 million above forecasts. Eliquis, used to prevent blood clots and partnered with Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), jumped 90 percent to $884 million, $71 million above expectations, helped by compelling clinical trial data.It was not immediately clear how much of an impact price increases had on sales of Bristol-Myers drugs. Bristol-Myers earned $1.2 billion, or 72 cents per share in the quarter, compared with $706 million, or 42 cents per share, a year ago. Revenue jumped 21 percent to $4.9 billion, about $200 million above forecasts.Excluding special items, it earned 77 cents per share, well above expectations of 65 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Despite Bristol-Myers' rally on Thursday, its shares have fallen 31 percent since the unfavorable Opdivo lung cancer data was reported on Aug. 5.

908,"   By Ransdell Pierson  Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) scrapped its high-profile cholesterol fighter after its effectiveness waned over time in large clinical trials, sending its shares 2 percent lower and prompting the company to trim its 2016 earnings forecast.The largest U.S. drugmaker trimmed the top end of its 2016 profit estimate on Tuesday, citing costs of scrapping the experimental injectable medicine, called bococizumab, which works by blocking the PCSK9 protein.Pfizer said bococizumab gradually lost its potency in reducing ""bad"" LDL cholesterol and caused more irritation at the injection site than similar recently approved drugs.Pfizer has been trying to catch up with two rival drugs approved by U.S. regulators more than a year ago. Repatha, from Amgen Inc (AMGN.O), and Praluent, from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc (REGN.O) and Sanofi SA (SASY.PA), can slash LDL cholesterol almost 60 percent, more effectively than traditional statins like Pfizer's Lipitor.But large ongoing trials have not yet determined whether they could actually reduce heart attacks.Chief Executive Ian Read said in an interview that the effectiveness of Pfizer's drug waned in a significant number of patients after 52 weeks of treatment, which was surprising given the drug's ""robust"" effectiveness at 12 weeks and 24 weeks.""The product looked great until we got the 52-week data,"" Read said. Pfizer wants to become a bigger force in heart medicine by developing other experimental treatments but has no plans to pursue another PCSK9 inhibitor, Read added. Edward Jones analyst Ashtyn Evans said she had expected annual bococizumab sales of $500 million by 2020 and was disappointed that the drug's waning effectiveness did not become apparent until costly Phase III studies were almost complete.She said Pfizer's stock price of 12 times the company's expected earnings per share for 2017 lagged the drug sector and that successful new products were needed to bring it into parity. The stock closed 64 cents lower at $31.07.Repatha and Praluent each have annual sales of only about $100 million, far below initial expectations. Insurers have blocked reimbursements largely because each treatment costs more than $14,000 a year.At the American Heart Association's annual Scientific Sessions in New Orleans later this month, Amgen will present data on Repatha's ability to reduce artery-clogging plaque. The company has said that the drug succeeded as measured by ultrasound pictures of the inside of arteries.  Details of the magnitude of plaque reduction and just how clinically meaningful that might be is slated to be discussed at the annual sessions. Arterial plaque is considered one of the underlying causes of heart attacks and heart disease.RBC Capital Markets analyst Adnan Butt said Pfizer's decision was good news for the PCSK9 program being conducted by The Medicines Co (MDCO.O).""There is one fewer competitor and any big biopharma looking for an LDL cholesterol lowering program should want MDCO's PCSK9si,"" Butt said.    That drug, currently in Phase III testing, works in a different way than the approved drugs by Amgen and Regeneron and may be administered quarterly or only twice a year.The Medcines Co's shares rose 3.1 percent to close at $33.97. Pfizer cut the upper end of its 2016 earnings forecast to $2.43 per share from $2.48 while retaining the lower end at $2.38. The drugmaker, which in September decided not to split itself into two, said it earned 61 cents per share in the third quarter, excluding special items. The results missed the analysts' average estimate by 1 cent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Quarterly sales of $13.05 billion matched Wall Street expectations.Sales of Ibrance, one of Pfizer's most important new drugs, totaled $550 million, trailing forecasts of $576 million.

924,"   By Lauren Hirsch, Olivia Oran and Carl O'Donnell  U.S. drugmaker Pfizer Inc is evaluating a potential sale or spin-off of its consumer health division that could value the unit at as much as $14 billion, people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday. A Pfizer exit from the consumer health business, which includes lip balm Chapstick and painkiller Advil, would be one of its biggest corporate moves since abandoning a $160 billion deal to buy Irish drugmaker Allergan Inc earlier this year. The deliberations are still in a preliminary stage and the New York-based pharmaceutical company may opt to retain the business, the people said.  The people asked not to be named because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter. Pfizer declined to comment.  Pfizer earlier this year decided against splitting itself into two companies, one housing its patent-protected drug business and one containing its generics business. Pfizer began openly planning for a possible split in early 2014, as a way to simplify its portfolio. In Pfizer's most recent quarterly earnings call, Chief Executive Officer Ian Read said that Pfizer was continually evaluating whether its consumer business, along with other business lines, was worth more in or outside the company.The consumer business had annual sales of about $3.5 billion.  If a sale or spin-off went ahead, Pfizer would be the latest pharmaceutical company to sell its consumer business to slim down its portfolio. Consumer drugs sold over the counter have far lower margins than prescription drugs.In 2014, Merck & Co Inc sold its consumer care business, including the MiraLAX laxative, to Germany's Bayer AG in a $14.2 billion deal. In early 2015, drugmakers GlaxoSmithKline PLC and Novartis AG agreed to merge their consumer health businesses through a joint venture, run by Glaxo as part of a $20 billion asset swap.  Reckitt Benckiser Group Plc's  CEO, Rakesh Kapoor, last year said it would consider buying Pfizer's consumer unit if it were to come up for sale. Pfizer has been one of most active acquirers in an otherwise sluggish year for pharmaceutical M&A. In August it bought cancer drugmaker Medivation for $14 billion. Earlier this year, it acquired dermatology company Anacor Pharmaceuticals for $5.2 billion.

""Nobody knows what the new landscape will look like.

The recent failure of Bristol-Myers Squibb's (BMY.N) rival immunotherapy Opdivo in previously untreated lung patients has opened up the market opportunity, but there is no certainty AstraZeneca's trial will hit its goal.A sharp share price fall last month on a setback in two studies testing durvalumab in treating head and neck cancers shows the nervousness surrounding the firm's big cancer bet.On the research front, AstraZeneca said it now expected the first submission for regulatory approval of its new blood cancer drug acalabrutinib to be made in the first half of 2017.It also said it had given up on the idea of seeking an early approval of durvalumab in head and neck cancer, although this would not affect prospects for its use in a combination therapy treatment for lung cancer.Unlike British rival GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L), which has lower-risk businesses such as consumer healthcare to buttress risky drug research, AstraZeneca is focused solely on finding new prescription medicines.Soriot saw off a $100 billion takeover attempt by Pfizer (PFE.N) in 2014 but the company has remained subject to takeover speculation.

In what it called a major expansion of its humanitarian assistance work, the drugmaker said its Prevenar 13 shot, which protects babies and children against pneumonia and other diseases, would be offered in a new multi-dose vial at the lowest prevailing global price, currently $3.10 per dose.""In addition, given the acute need for aid on the ground, Pfizer will donate all sales proceeds for the first year of this program to humanitarian groups undertaking the difficult work of reaching vulnerable populations in emergency settings,"" the company said in a statement. The move follows a similar one by the British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline, which said in September it would cut the price of its pneumococcal vaccine, Synflorix, to $3.05 when it is used in humanitarian crises.The price cuts also come after sustained and intense pressure from the international medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), which had accused the two drugmakers of charging exorbitant prices for the much-needed vaccines. Prior to GSK's price-cut pledge, MSF said that in Greece, it had been forced to pay 50 pounds ($65) a dose in local pharmacies in order to vaccinate thousands of refugee children fleeing from conflicts in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan.Responding to Pfizer's announcement on Friday, Jason Cone, executive director of MSF-USA, said in a statement it was a welcome development after ""years of negotiation"".""This is definitely a step in the right direction and will help to protect millions of vulnerable children around the world and in MSF projects,"" he said.

937,"   By Svea Herbst-Bayliss | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Healthcare stocks, including insurers, have jumped since Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election last week and some hedge fund managers may see further gains in after making new bets in the sector in the third quarter.Billionaire investor Daniel Loeb's Third Point portfolio  invested in insurer Humana Inc during the third quarter, according to the latest 13F hedge fund filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Loeb's hedge fund bought 1.4 million shares of Humana.John Paulson's Paulson & Co., whose investments have been followed closely ever since his successful bet against the housing market, also took a new position in Humana, buying 79,500 shares. Pointstate Capital put on a new position as well, buying 991,622 shares. At Glenview Capital Management, where Humana was already the biggest investment, the firm raised its holdings by 9.0 percent.  Diamond Hill Capital, Samlyn Capital, P. Schoenfeld Asset Management and Clovis Capital Management also made new bets on the insurer, although they were far smaller, according to regulatory filings that show what U.S. stocks investment managers owned on Sept. 30.Over the last six weeks, Humana has been one of the sector's best performers, boasting a 12.16 percent gain since Sept. 30. Since January, the stock has gained 11 percent, handily outperforming the S&P 500's 6 percent gain.Some insurers including UnitedHealth Group Inc and Anthem Inc had said they are losing money on the healthcare exchanges created by President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act. With Donald Trump vowing to overturn the law, UnitedHealth and Anthem have also posted strong gains since the end of the third quarter. Anthem has climbed 10.5 percent in the last six weeks with UnitedHealth gaining 9 percent and Aetna Inc posting a 7.5 percent rise.Glenview Capital boosted its Anthem bet by 41 percent while Hotchkis & Wiley Capital Management and Cornerstone Advisors Inc also each raised their stakes.

938,"   By Sinead Carew  U.S. stocks closed little changed on Monday after rising dramatically the week before and a decline in the technology sector offset a steep rise in financial stocks as investors bet on higher interest rates.After choppy trading late in the session, the Dow ended at a record high while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite dipped.""I think all we're doing is trimming our sails a little from the violently positive rally we had post-election results last week,"" said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has been under pressure since the Nov. 8 election as investors poured money into sectors such as financials, industrials and energy, which are seen benefiting from President-elect Donald Trump's policies.The financial index rose 2.3 percent, with banks including Bank of America JPMorgan providing the biggest boost. The index has risen 10.8 percent since the election on hopes of deregulation and higher interest rates. While the financial rally gained steam, the S&P technology index closed down 1.7 percent, leading the decliners. The index has fallen 3 percent since the election.  Apple fell 2.5 percent and weighed the most on the Nasdaq and the S&P 500, followed by Facebook and Microsoft. Since technology valuations have soared in recent years, investors are switching money to sectors such as banks, which has been relatively cheaper but should now benefit from rising interest rates, said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh.Investors have been betting technology will look relatively less attractive if Trump lives up to his promise to review regulation in healthcare and financial sectors and to increase government spending on infrastructure to boost economic growth.      ""If growth becomes more even and available, we may see a continuation of rotation into lower-valuation, more cyclical businesses and out of high-valuation growth stocks like technology,"" said James Abate, chief investment officer at Centre Asset Management in New York.  The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 21.03 points, or 0.11 percent, to 18,868.69, the S&P 500 lost 0.25 points, or 0.01 percent, to 2,164.2 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 18.72 points, or 0.36 percent, to 5,218.40.The U.S. Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise interest rates at its December meeting, with traders pricing in a 91-percent chance, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool.The industrial index finished up 0.4 percent, buoyed by prospects for increased infrastructure outlays.  Harman International rose 25.2 percent to $109.72 after Samsung Electronics announced an $8 billion deal to buy the company.Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.10-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.44-to-1 ratio favored advancers.The S&P 500 posted 82 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 423 new highs and 31 new lows.About 10 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges on Monday, far above the 7.7 billion average for the previous 20 sessions.

939,"   By Svea Herbst-Bayliss | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Nov 14 Healthcare stocks, including insurers, are primed for a shot in the arm from a Trump presidency and some hedge fund managers stand to reap the gains after making new bets in the sector in the third quarter.Billionaire investor Daniel Loeb, who recently told clients  that idiosyncratic opportunities have buoyed Third Point's portfolio this year, invested in insurer Humana Inc  during the third quarter, according to a new filing. Loeb's hedge fund bought 1.4 million shares of Humana.Diamond Hill Capital, Samlyn Capital, P. Schoenfeld Asset Management and Clovis Capital Management also made new bets on the insurer, although they were far smaller, according to regulatory filings that show what U.S. stocks investment managers owned on Sept. 30.Over the last six weeks, Humana has been one of the sector's best performers, boasting a 12.16 percent gain since Sept. 30. Since January, the stock has gained 11 percent, handily outperforming the S&P 500's 6 percent gain.Some insurers including UnitedHealth Group Inc and Anthem Inc had said they are losing money on the healthcare exchanges created by President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act. With Donald Trump vowing to overturn the law, UnitedHealth and Anthem have also posted strong gains since the end of the third quarter. Anthem has climbed 10.5 percent in the last six weeks with UnitedHealth gaining 9 percent and Aetna Inc posting a 7.5 percent rise.Investment managers Hotchkis & Wiley Capital Management as well as Cornerstone Advisors Inc each raised their stakes in Anthem while Vulcan Value Partners and Two Sigma Investments increased their bets on UnitedHealth.Most investment managers released their 13-F filings on Monday and while the information is backward looking, it is watched closely by investors for hints of upcoming trends.

942,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, November 15 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A+(EXP)' rating to  Pfizer's senior unsecured notes offering. The net proceeds of the issuance will  be used to fund the purchase of the company's 6.2% notes due March 15, 2019. The ratings apply to roughly $42.3 billion of debt outstanding at July 3, 2016.  A full list of ratings follows at the end of this release.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Little Leverage Flexibility: Despite Fitch's expectation that Pfizer will  continue to generate stable operating performance and significant free cash flow  (FCF), leverage remains strained, stemming from acquisitions and share  repurchases during the past two years. The company's net cash outlays for  acquisitions and share repurchases were roughly $30.5 billion during the period  (excluding the subsequent $14 billion acquisition of Medivation), while FCF was  $7 billion. As a result, Pfizer currently has little-to-no flexibility to  increase leverage further within the 'A+' rating category. Strategic Uncertainty Removed: Pfizer will retain its Global Established  Pharmaceuticals (GEP) business for the time being. Fitch would view a  divestiture as strategically positive for Pfizer, as it would narrow the  company's focus on its higher margin, innovative portfolio. However, the  company's business model would be more reliant on its innovative drug discovery  efforts. Regardless, the decision removes the uncertainty regarding whether it  would decrease debt subsequent to the spin.  Manageable Patent Expiries: The company's intermediate-term patent cliff is  manageable. Over the next three years, roughly 18% of standalone Pfizer's drug  portfolio is at risk of losing market exclusivity, including two of its five  best-selling medicines - Lyrica (approximately 10% of total firm sales) and  Enbrel (approximately 7%). The base patent for Enbrel expired internationally  beginning in 2015. Pfizer does not have rights to Enbrel in the U.S. and Canada,  but does receive modest royalty income from Amgen for sales in those regions.  Lyrica's U.S. patent expires in late 2018. Fitch does not expect that Enbrel will face as serious a competitive threat from  generic alternatives as with traditional small molecules such as Lyrica. Enbrel  is a biologic, and a generic biologic that is automatically interchangeable with  Enbrel will not likely emerge. Therefore, Fitch expects competitive challengers  will require significant research and marketing investments, making steep price  discounts and drastic market share gains by competitors less likely.  Pipeline Successes: Helping to mitigate the anticipated revenue challenges from  patent expiries, Pfizer has added new revenue sources over the past two years,  including Ibrance/palbociclib (breast cancer), Trumenba (Neisseria meningitis  vaccine), (Duavee (vasomotor symptoms of menopause), Adult Prevnar 13  (pneumococcal vaccine expanded use), Xeljanz (arthritis) and Bosulif (cancer).  The company is making progress with late-stage pipeline candidates, such as  tafamidis (polyneuropathy), dacomitinib (lung cancer), inotuzumab (leukemia),  tanezumab (pain) and avelumab (various cancers). Pfizer is conducting clinical  trials that could expand the market of its marketed products by gaining  approvals for their broader clinical use. Pfizer is also pursuing external  pipeline projects through collaborations and acquisitions, such as its recent  acquisition of Medivation.  KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions for Pfizer include: --Mid-single-digit organic revenue growth during 2016-2017 supported by newer  product sales and manageable patent expiries; --Incrementally improving margins driven by new product sales mix and the  achievement of $800 million in Hospira acquisition related cost savings; --Annual FCF (cash flow from operations minus capital expenditures minus  dividends) of $6 billion to $7 billion during 2016-2017; --Leverage to decline to below 1.7x by 2017 through increased operational EBITDA  or a combination of debt reduction and increased EBITDA.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: While Fitch does not anticipate a positive rating action in the near  term, future developments that may individually or collectively, lead to such an  action include: --If Pfizer maintains gross debt leverage in the range of 1.0x to 1.3x; --If the company sustains strong operational performance through the current  patent cliff period, including relatively stable-to-positive trends in revenues,  margins and FCF. Negative: Future developments that may individually or collectively, lead to a  negative rating action include: --If Pfizer does not return to a sustainable gross debt leverage of 1.7x or  lower. This could stem from marketplace pressures, adverse actions from  regulatory bodies, unfavorable clinical developments or an aggressive capital  deployment strategy; --If Pfizer pursues transactions (another large acquisition and/or significant  share repurchases) that place pressure on gross leverage without the expectation  of deleveraging in a timely manner. LIQUIDITY Adequate Liquidity: Fitch looks for Pfizer to maintain solid liquidity through  strong FCF generation and ample access to the credit markets. FCF for the latest  12 months (LTM) ending July 3, 2016 was $6.2 billion. At the end of the period,  Pfizer had approximately $20.9 billion in cash/short-term investments and full  availability on its $7 billion revolver, maturing in November 2020. Fitch views Pfizer's debt maturity schedule as manageable and expects the  company to refinance the vast majority of its upcoming maturities with  additional borrowings. Pfizer has approximately $3.7 billion of long-term debt  maturing in 2016, $4.3 billion in 2017 and $2.3 billion in 2018.

943,"   By Ben Hirschler | LONDON  LONDON Two of Europe's biggest drugmakers warned on Tuesday there would be no let up in pressure on U.S. medicine prices after last week's presidential election win for Republican Donald Trump, which sent pharmaceutical and biotech shares soaring.Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) in the sector, meanwhile, could get a big boost if Trump pushes through plans for a U.S. ""tax holiday"" on repatriated overseas profits, executives said. Both France's Sanofi (SASY.PA) and Britain's GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) have recent direct experience of U.S. pricing pressure, with healthcare providers forcing big discounts for their top-selling diabetes and respiratory medicines.In the run-up to the U.S. election, investors had focused on the threat of price controls posed by Democrat Hillary Clinton, yet Trump also advocated a new role for government agencies in negotiating down drug costs.""I don't think the pricing debate is over,"" Sanofi Chief Executive Olivier Brandicourt told an industry conference. Drugmakers are already having to work much harder to justify U.S. prices due to the rising power of U.S. pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), which administer drug benefits and negotiate rebates for employers and health plans. The buying power of these middlemen has been brought to bear particularly in areas of medicine where there are several similar treatments to choose from, such as insulin injections and inhalers for asthma and chronic lung disease.OVERSEAS CASH   The trend toward big buyers squeezing prices is only going to accelerate as the U.S. healthcare system struggles to find the resources to pay for new medical interventions, GSK CEO Andrew Witty said.""It doesn't really matter too much who won the U.S. election because the direction of travel of the U.S. marketplace, owned not by one stakeholder in the White House but by multiple stakeholders in public and private decision-making environments, is already set,"" he told the Financial Times meeting.Manufacturers contend that the discounts extracted by PBMs are not always passed on to patients. ""We are making significant concessions but patients are paying more,"" said Brandicourt, who believes legislation may eventually be needed to ensure patients gain from the discounts.Another key question for investors is the potential for a further wave of deal-making in the healthcare sector, given impetus by Trump's plan to work with Congress to allow U.S. firms to pay a lower tax rate when bringing back overseas cash.That would add tens of billions of dollars in firepower for pharma and biotech acquisitions, with deal-hungry Pfizer (PFE.N) alone having more than $80 billion it wants to repatriate.

The future of Merck KGaA's pharmaceuticals division rests largely on avelumab, after the business suffered development setbacks in several other medicines and amid rising competition for its established brands, such as Rebif against multiple sclerosis.

952,"  Pfizer Inc said on Wednesday its experimental biosimilar of Roche Holding AG's blockbuster breast cancer treatment Herceptin was found comparable with the branded version in a key study.Biotech drugs such as Herceptin are made in living cells, and then extracted and purified. They are more complex than traditional drugs and cannot be copied with precision.Unlike generic drugs, which are interchangeable with their branded counterparts, biosimilars approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to date are not considered interchangeable.Several companies are developing biosimilar versions of top-selling biotech drugs. The allure is clear, with insurers counting on the steep discounts. U.S. pharmacy benefit managers are already trimming brand-name drugs from their rosters.Pfizer tested the safety and effectiveness of the drug, PF-05280014, in combination with chemotherapeutic agent paclitaxel against Herceptin and paclitaxel in previously untreated patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. Mylan NV asked U.S. regulators earlier this month to approve its own biosimilar form of Herceptin, being developed with India's Biocon Ltd, after it was shown to be similarly safe and effective as Roche's drug in a large late-stage study.Amgen Inc and partner Allergan Plc are also racing to develop a Herceptin biosimilar, which has showed it is comparable with the branded version in a late-stage trial. Herceptin, which is also used to treat gastric cancer, generated global sales of more than $6.5 billion in 2015, making it one of Roche's top products.Biosimilars are not expected to become available for at  least another year or two in the United States. The U.S. patent on Herceptin is slated to lapse in 2019, although some industry analysts believe a biosimilar could be launched as soon as 2018. Pfizer's stock little changed in early trading on Wednesday.

953,"  Pfizer Inc said on Monday its cancer drug, Bosulif, was found superior to Novartis AG's Gleevec in a late-stage study on untreated patients with a form of blood and bone marrow cancer characterized by abnormal white blood cells production.Most people with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) have a genetic mutation, called the Philadelphia chromosome, which causes the bone marrow to make an enzyme that triggers the development of abnormal and unhealthy white blood cells.Gleevec is considered a standard-of-care therapy for these patients.Bosulif is already approved to treat adults with Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) CML who are resistant or intolerant to prior therapies, including Gleevec. Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd, India's largest drugmaker, launched its generic version of Gleevec in the United States in February, pricing it about 30 percent lower than the original drug's annual price of around $90,000. Pfizer said on Monday it would work with regulators to seek approval for Bosulif for previously untreated Ph+ CML patients.Pfizer's shares were up 0.3 percent at $31.72, in line with the gains among health stocks, in early trading.
