0,"  HOUSTON, March 11 NRG Energy Inc's said its retail electric U.S. customer base will grow by 30 percent with Tuesday's agreement to acquire the retail power business of Dominion Resources Inc for an undisclosed amount.Princeton, New Jersey-based NRG has about 2 million residential and commercial customers and will add more than 600,000 customer accounts served by Dominion and its Cirro Energy unit, a spokeswoman said.Dominion's retail customers are in Connecticut, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Ohio and Pennsylvania.Cirro Energy, which was purchased in 2008 by Dominion Retail, serves residential and business customers in Texas.About 80 percent of Dominion's customer base is in the Northeast with the remainder in Texas, according to a spokeswoman. ""We are working to ensure that when the deal closes, the transition of Dominion customers to NRG is smooth and that it paves the way for our special brand of customized electricity plans,"" said Jim Steffes, president of NRG's Northeast retail business.In Texas, NRG will continue to operate Cirro Energy under the Cirro name, which joins NRG's Reliant Energy and Green Mountain units, said Elizabeth Killinger, president of NRG Retail Texas. Terms of the Dominion deal, expected to close by the end of March, were not disclosed.Also on Tuesday, a U.S. bankruptcy court approved Edison International's plan of reorganization for Edison Mission Energy, a merchant generating unit, with power plants across the country. Court approval will allow NRG to buy nearly 8,000 megawatts of coal, gas and wind generation from Edison Mission for $2.64 billion.",2014-03-11,NRG,"Tue Mar 11, 2014 | 6:50pm EDT",NRG Energy's U.S. customer base expands by 30 pct with Dominion deal,http://www.reuters.com//article/utilities-nrg-power-idUSL2N0M82A320140311?type=companyNews
1,"  April 11 The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission's judicial arm ruled in favor of the group looking to build two new reactors at the South Texas nuclear power plant in Texas on the issue of foreign ownership, NRG Energy Inc  said on Friday.Nuclear Innovation North America (NINA), which is 90 percent owned by New Jersey-based NRG and 10 percent owned by Toshiba Corp of Japan, wants to build the new reactors.However, Toshiba has an option to acquire up to 90 percent ownership of NINA, which the NRC staff determined could give Toshiba an 85 percent ownership interest in the new reactors.NINA has been battling staff at the NRC over the issue of foreign ownership since soon after NRG said it would no longer invest additional capital in the project due to U.S. regulatory uncertainty in the wake of the Fukushima nuclear accident in Japan in March 2011. Foreign companies cannot control nuclear plants in the United States.""This ruling clears one of the last remaining items necessary for issuance of a combined license"" for the proposed new reactors, said Mark McBurnett, president and chief executive officer of NINA. Officials at the NRC were not immediately available to comment.The South Texas plant has two existing 1,280-megawatt reactors. In 2007, the South Texas owners applied with the NRC to add two Toshiba 1,350-MW Advanced Boiling Water Reactors at a cost of at least $17 billion. The two operating reactors are owned by NRG (44 percent), the City of San Antonio's CPS Energy utility (40 percent) and the City of Austin's Austin Energy (16 percent).The NRC has said it will not make any final reactor license decisions anywhere in the nation until at least late 2014 due to issues surrounding the long-term storage of spent nuclear fuel.(Reporting by Scott DiSavino in New York; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)",2014-04-11,NRG,"Fri Apr 11, 2014 | 6:25pm EDT",Group seeking to build South Texas nuclear reactors passes NRC test,http://www.reuters.com//article/utilities-nrg-southtexas-idUSL2N0N31VO20140411?type=companyNews

9,"  (Adds details of approval)June 12 The New York Public Service Commission approved on Thursday NRG Energy Inc's plan to refuel the 435-megawatt Dunkirk coal-fired power plant in New York with natural gas, the state utility regulator said.The PSC said the project is expected to reduce emissions, ""improve the reliability of the electric system and provide economic benefits to Western New York.""Under the $140 million agreement between NRG and a U.S. unit of UK power company National Grid Plc, the repowered facility will operate for 10 years. It is expected to enter service in the autumn of 2015. The PSC said it will allow National Grid to recover the costs of its agreement with Dunkirk.NRG will refuel three coal units at Dunkirk to generate up to 435 MW. At present, only one 75-MW unit is operating on coal, the PSC said. One megawatt can power about 1,000 homes in New York.The PSC said in a news release that Dunkirk, once repowered,  will still be able to burn coal as a backup fuel in case gas is in short supply, which sometimes happens on the coldest winter days when utilities use most of the gas supplies to heat homes and businesses. NRG said in early 2012 it wanted to mothball Dunkirk, which is more than 50 years old, because it was no longer economical to operate.National Grid, however, said idling the plant would result in significant harm to transmission system reliability in western New York.The PSC said the refueling plan will create about 50 construction jobs, preserve permanent jobs at the site, and restore tax payments to the Dunkirk community to their previous level of about $8 million annually.

Abengoa Yield's shares opened at $35.16 and rose to a high of $37 on the Nasdaq.Abengoa Yield said in a filing that the company was created to manage and acquire renewable energy assets in the United States and South America.Yield-paying firms, or yield cos, are expected to pay a major portion of their earnings in dividends, a valuable source of funding for their parent companies, which owns sizeable stakes. The move to form yield cos is becoming popular mostly among solar firms seeking cheaper ways to finance their business. TerraForm Power, a unit that SunEdison Inc created to own and operate some of its solar power plants, filed for an IPO last month to raise up to $50 million.Canadian Solar Inc and JinkoSolar Holding Co Ltd  have also said that they are considering such a move.Shares of NRG Yield Inc, which holds solar assets of power company NRG Energy Inc, have risen about 92 percent since going public in July. Abengoa Yield, in which parent Abengoa owns a 71 percent stake, expects a payout ratio of 90 percent of its cash available for distribution and intends to pay a regular dividend from the third quarter ending Sept. 30.Parent company Abengoa generates 30 percent of its revenue from the United States, compared with 18 percent from its home market.Net proceeds from the offering would be distributed to the parent company, Abengoa Yield said.Abengoa Yield's loss attributable to the combined group for the three months ended March 31 widened to $26.9 million from $4.9 million a year earlier.

12,"   By Rory Carroll | SAN FRANCISCO, July 2  SAN FRANCISCO, July 2 NRG Energy vowed on Wednesday to press ahead with a proposal to build a power plant in coastal Southern California even after a city council expressed opposition, citing fears it could be inundated by rising sea water.The City Council of Oxnard approved a non-binding moratorium on the plan to build a natural gas-fired power plant to replace two of its older facilities, which require major upgrades or face decommissioning in 2020.David Knox, communications director for NRG, said that while the company was disappointed in the outcome of the vote, only the California Energy Commission, not the Oxnard City Council, has the power to stop the project.""We are continuing to move forward with this project regardless of the moratorium,"" he said. ""We've looked at the predicted sea level rises and where the units are going to be and there's not an issue during the life of these plants,"" he said.That was in contrast to climate change modeling maps developed by The Nature Conservancy and shown to the Oxnard City Council, projecting that the plants would be under water by 2020 or sooner. ""There's a place for critical infrastructure and it's not in areas that will be threatened by sea level rise and climate driven hazards,"" said Lily Verdone of the The Nature Conservancy.""We're thrilled with (the council's) decision,"" she said. The new plant would sit about 500 feet (152 metres) from the ocean at high tide.The California Energy Commission will conduct its own review of the project before licensing it, which will take into account sea level rise.The Oxnard City Council will meet again in the next 45 days to discuss whether to extend the non-binding moratorium, which could last for up to two years.

13,"   By Rory Carroll | SAN FRANCISCO, July 15  SAN FRANCISCO, July 15 NRG Energy and Japan's JX Nippon on Tuesday announced plans to capture carbon emissions from a Texas coal plant and use the pollution to boost oil production at an aging field, the latest attempt to bring to life a troubled technology seen as a key to combating climate change.When completed in 2016, the Petra Nova Carbon Capture Project will trap 1.6 million tons of carbon annually from one unit of NRG's WA Parish power plant and pipe it 82 miles (132 km) to the West Ranch Oil Field.There it will be injected underground to help stimulate oil production, and revenue, for NRG and JX Nippon, which each hold a 25 percent interest in the field.Oil production at the field is expected to rise from 500 barrels per day to more than 15,000 barrels per day as a result. Money from the sale of the oil will eventually pay off the $1 billion price tag for installing the carbon capture equipment, the companies said.""While the electrical generation business is working to control our carbon emissions, carbon is incredibly important to the oil industry for continuing production at mature oil fields,"" said Arun Banskota, president of Petra Nova project.""We are building a model that is a win-win for both industries, providing the CO2 that the oil industries needs and the revenue the generating companies need to make projects like this economic,"" he said. The widespread deployment of carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) technology is viewed as essential to stopping runaway climate change, but the high price of CCS projects coupled with the lack of a national carbon price have made it difficult for power companies to justify the investment.U.S. federal funds for CCS projects, which were instrumental in getting Petra Nova off the ground, are drying up. Meanwhile the U.S. Department of Energy's troubled FutureGen CCS project is on its second iteration but has yet to capture a single ton of carbon.But with natural underground sources of carbon dwindling, the oil industry in Texas is willing to pay $30 to $40 per ton of carbon dioxide, a price that could spur CCS projects in the future, said John Thompson of the Clean Air Task Force. Thompson said projects like Petra Nova transform CCS from a technology that simply mitigates climate change to one that also generates energy, a much more lucrative enterprise.""Every joule that is used at the power plant to capture and compress that CO2 creates 3 to 4 joules of new energy from oil that would be otherwise unrecoverable,"" he said.He said projects like Petra Nova are also critical because they bring together engineering expertise and financing from Asia and the United States. The technology at the project was developed by Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Kansai Electric Power Co.An even more ambitious CCS project proposed by Summit Power  for a new Texas power plant recently received a pledge for financing from China.The project had stalled due to cost overruns but was brought back to life after the China Huanqiu Contracting & Engineering Corporation (HQC), an affiliate of China National Petroleum Corporation, agreed to provide money for it.Like Petra Nova, Summit's Texas Clean Energy Project will use the carbon it captures to pump oil when it is completed.Thompson said multinational collaboration is critical to the evolution of CCS.""The beauty is it creates the possibility for CCS projects on both sides of the Pacific, which really speeds the effort to address global warming globally.""

14,"   By Rory Carroll and Ayesha Rascoe | SAN FRANCISCO, Sept 4  SAN FRANCISCO, Sept 4 NRG Energy on Friday will begin retrofitting one unit of its WA Parish power plant in Texas to capture its carbon emissions but the technology has a long ways to go to reduce climate change, the company's chief executive officer said.The $1 billion Petra Nova project, a joint venture with Japan's JX Nippon, will eventually trap 1.6 million tons of carbon annually from the coal unit and pipe it 82 miles (132 km) to an oil field, where it will be injected underground to help push crude oil to the surface.The revenue from the sale of that oil will eventually pay for the installation of the expensive carbon capture equipment. When completed in 2016, Petra Nova will be the largest project of its kind in the world.While the success of the project is important to proving the nascent technology is workable, more breakthroughs are need if carbon capture and sequestration technology is going to help prevent runaway climate change, NRG CEO David Crane told Reuters on Thursday.Only about 5 percent of the carbon emitted by all of the coal-fired power plants in the United States could employ the system used at Petra Nova, he said, since many coal plants are not located near oil fields or carbon transportation systems. ""This isn't the panacea or the final solution in the climate wars, but it's an important step,"" Crane said.""The technology we're using comes from the chemical industry and it's tried and true. But somewhere in the next five to 10 years they're going to find a completely different way of isolating the carbon molecules. That's where you're going to find a disruptive breakthrough in the sector that's going to help save the world,"" he said. Petra Nova previously received a $167 million grant from the U.S. Department of Energy as part of a clean coal initiative, money NRG said was instrumental in getting the project off the ground.Chris Smith, principal deputy assistant secretary for fossil energy at the Energy Department, defended the use of captured carbon to extract fossil fuels even as the administration focuses on addressing climate change.""You're not increasing oil consumption. Oil demand is what it is,"" Smith told Reuters in a phone interview. ""It prevents us from having to import that quantity of oil from overseas."" Smith said linking enhanced oil recovery to carbon capture is essential at this point to support large projects demonstrating the technology that would limit the greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired power plants.""Right now where you don't have a price on carbon, these projects are critically important and they do a lot of good,"" Smith said.""I think that you can't think about the sustainable clean energy economy of the future without thinking about how you manage emitting sources of today.""(Reporting by Rory Carroll in San Francisco and Ayesha Rascoe in Washington; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)",2014-09-05,NRG,"Thu Sep 4, 2014 | 8:24pm EDT",NRG Energy retrofitting Texas power plant to capture CO2 emissions,http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-carbon-capture-idUSL1N0R600I20140905?type=companyNews
15,"  LOS ANGELES, April 15 NRG Energy Inc is turning California's devastating drought into a business opportunity.The power company, which has a small but fast-growing rooftop solar business, is giving customers in parts of the Golden State the option to bundle a solar energy system with products and services that will help them conserve water.The offering is part of NRG's new focus on providing products and services that give customers more control over their energy use. NRG Home was created last year as part of the company's reorganization. NRG tapped Washington strategist Steve McBee to lead the new business unit late last year. NRG is partnering with Denver-based Rachio, a startup that makes a sprinkler controller that can be controlled from a smartphone. New and existing NRG solar customers can bundle their home solar panels with either a Rachio watering system or receive financial support for replacing their grass with drought-resistant plants.""We view this as a start and a way for us to be there for our customers in an area that is a pain point right now,"" McBee said in an interview. The bundles are available beginning on Wednesday in Fresno and San Diego and are expected to be expanded to other parts of the state. NRG accelerated the rollout of the new offering by several weeks, according to McBee, after California Gov. Jerry Brown earlier this month ordered residents and businesses to cut water use by 25 percent in the first mandatory statewide reduction in state history.The state's drought is now entering its fourth year.

18,"  NEW YORK A consortium of York Capital Management, NRG Energy and ITC Holdings have proposed investing as much as $3.5 billion in Puerto Rico's electrical infrastructure, a source familiar with the consortium said on Thursday.The island's electricity is supplied by struggling electric power authority PREPA, which has debt of around $9 billion and is due to present creditors with a business plan on Monday.The proposal was earlier reported by Caribbean Business publication and does not include an ad hoc group of PREPA's bondholders, the report said.  PREPA's ad hoc group of creditors, including OppenheimerFunds and Franklin Templeton, in March offered $2 billion to finance a turnaround at PREPA, $1.2 billion of which would fund a new natural gas facility. “Our interests are aligned — our goal is the improvement of PREPA and therefore we welcome the introduction of any creative solutions that will benefit all PREPA stakeholders,” said Stephen Spencer, a managing director at Houlihan Lokey and financial adviser to the ad hoc PREPA Bondholders.

20,"  (Adds reaction from head of Puerto Rico's Government Development Bank)NEW YORK May 28 A consortium of York Capital Management, NRG Energy Inc and ITC Holdings Corp  have proposed investing as much as $3.5 billion in Puerto Rico's electrical infrastructure, a source familiar with the consortium said on Thursday.The island's electricity is supplied by struggling electric power authority PREPA, which has debt of around $9 billion and is due to present creditors with a business plan on Monday.The proposed investment would be for a total of $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion and would be subject to due diligence, the source said. The investment would be to modernize the electrical system, the source said.PREPA, which provides electricity to Puerto Rico's roughly 3.5 million residents, charges consumers around double the average customers pay in the U.S. mainland. It is under pressure to convert from burning oil to generate power to generally cheaper and cleaner natural gas.The proposal was earlier reported by Caribbean Business and does not include an ad hoc group of PREPA's bondholders, the report said. Caribbean Business said the proposed investment would save money by substituting existing units with small natural gas-fired turbine units.""At this stage of the process, we are not entertaining any particular proposal regarding our modernization plans,"" said Melba Acosta, head of Puerto Rico's Government Development Bank.""We are focused on discussing our plan to transform PREPA and reach a fair agreement with bondholders."" Acosta said that she was aware that several groups had expressed interest in modernizing PREPA.""At the proper time, all interested parties will be able to participate in an open competitive bidding process,"" she said.PREPA's ad hoc group of creditors, including OppenheimerFunds and Franklin Templeton, in March offered $2 billion to finance a turnaround at PREPA, $1.2 billion of which would fund a new natural gas facility.

21,"  Dec 3 NRG Energy Inc on Thursday said its chief executive of 12 years, David Crane, would step down immediately after investors grew impatient with his costly, long-term plan to transform the power plant owner into a renewable energy pioneer.Mauricio Gutierrez, NRG's chief operating officer, will replace Crane as president and CEO.Crane's departure comes as NRG's stock has been pushed down this year to levels not seen since 2004. During Crane's tenure, NRG expanded aggressively into new, renewable energy businesses like wind farms, rooftop solar installations and electric vehicle charging, turning a traditional gas and coal power plant company into a more costly and complex business. In September, the company said it would cut $150 million in costs and form a new company, dubbed GreenCo, for some of its renewable assets. That strategy failed to reassure investors, however, who have since sent NRG's stock down 40 percent. NRG shares were up 9 cents, or 0.8 percent, at $10.87 in midday trade on the New York Stock Exchange.
