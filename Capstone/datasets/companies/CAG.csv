The deal was first made public in March 2013 and was initially expected to be finalized late last year.""(ConAgra) is revising the timeline to complete the Ardent Mills transaction and now expects the transaction to close in the second quarter of calendar 2014,"" the company said in the filing. The U.S. Justice Department's antitrust division was investigating the merger that would result in Ardent Mills controlling about a third of U.S. flour mill capacity. ConAgra in the filing said the companies were prepared to divest four flour milling facilities prior to or simultaneous with the completion of the merger. Those flour mills are Horizon's facility in Los Angeles; and ConAgra's facilities in Oakland, California; Saginaw, Texas; and New Prague, Minnesota.

The company said on Tuesday its own private-label business was taking longer-than-estimated to reach expected operating profit levels, forcing it to cut prices to stem a fall in sales volumes.""The (forecast) revision again seems to reflect weakness in each and every part of CAG's business, including a longer-than-expected timeframe to integrate Ralcorp properly,"" Barclays analyst Andrew Lazar wrote in a note.ConAgra blamed the higher prices that Ralcorp had been charging and the disruption caused by restructuring before the acquisition for the weaker-than-expected results at its private-label business.""Our biggest issue is that the private brands operations are taking longer to fix than we thought,"" Chief Executive Gary Rodkin said on a conference call after forecasting a weaker-than-expected profit for the third quarter ending February.Analysts, including Lazar, pointed that even though ConAgra spent more on advertising and promotions to beef up sales, the return on investment (ROI) did not rise proportionately. ""Because U.S. consumers are so cash-strapped today, we do not expect incremental promotional and/or advertising dollars from food companies to generate the same ROI they once did,"" JP Morgan analysts Ken Goldman said.WEAK FORECAST ConAgra said it expects a steeper fall in sales in the consumer foods business as weak sales of key brands such as Orville Redenbacher's and Healthy Choice offset a growth in sales of smaller brands. Sales volumes at the business, which contributes about 60 percent to revenue, are expected to fall 3-4 percent in the second half of 2014. That is steeper than its prior forecast of 1-2 percent.The company said it expects Ralcorp to contribute about 20 cents per share to full-year earnings, down from its prior estimate of 25 cents.ConAgra cut its full-year adjusted earnings forecast to $2.22-$2.25 per share from $2.34-$2.38 per share. Analysts on average are expecting earnings of $2.34 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.The company forecast third-quarter adjusted earnings of about 60 cents per share, below the analysts average estimate of 66 cents per share.The Omaha, Nebraska-based company also said its Ardent Mills joint venture would now close in the second quarter of 2014 instead of the first quarter, due to ongoing regulatory reviews.The merger would join ConAgra with Horizon Milling LLC - a joint operation between Cargill Inc and CHS Inc  that already is the largest flour miller in the United States.The U.S. Justice Department's antitrust division was investigating the merger that would result in Ardent Mills controlling about a third of U.S. flour mill capacity.Shares of ConAgra were down 6.8 percent at $28.93 in early afternoon trading.

2,"  By Dan LevineSAN FRANCISCO Feb 20 A U.S. appeals court on Thursday revived a lawsuit against ConAgra Foods Inc  over the amount of sodium the company discloses on sunflower seed packages.The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco found that federal law does not preempt claims that the sodium content of edible coating on sunflower seed shells must be disclosed in the nutritional labeling.The case is one of a growing number of lawsuits against food manufacturers over their marketing practices. ""We don't comment on pending litigation, and we stand behind the accuracy of our labeling and the quality of our products,"" ConAgra said in an emailed statement.Lawyers for a purchaser of ConAgra's David Sunflower Seeds filed the proposed class-action lawsuit in a Los Angeles federal court. They claimed the nutritional information misrepresents the sodium content of the seeds by focusing exclusively on the kernels, according to court documents. However, since consumers place the entire seed in their mouths before eating the kernel and spitting out the shell, ConAgra should disclose the sodium in both, the 2012 lawsuit said.A lower court judge dismissed the lawsuit, but a three-judge 9th Circuit panel ruled 2-1 on Thursday that the shell coatings are intended to be ingested. ""Indeed, these coatings come in flavors such as 'Ranch' and 'Nacho Cheese' precisely because they are to be consumed before the shell is discarded,"" 9th Circuit Judge Barry Silverman wrote.An attorney for the plaintiff could not immediately be reached for comment.The case in the 9th Circuit is Lilly vs. ConAgra Foods, 12-55921.",2014-02-20,CAG,"Thu Feb 20, 2014 | 3:37pm EST",UPDATE 2-Sunflower seed lawsuit against ConAgra can proceed -court,http://www.reuters.com//article/conagra-labeling-ruling-idUSL2N0LP1ZE20140220?type=companyNews

Writing for the 8th Circuit, Chief Judge William Jay Riley said the consumers lacked standing to sue in federal court, calling it ""pure speculation"" that any Hebrew National products they personally bought were tainted by non-kosher beef.But Riley added that if it becomes clear a lawsuit does not belong in federal court after a defendant such as ConAgra moves it there, then the solution is to return it to the state court where it came from, not to dismiss it altogether.Frank did not do that, and as a result his ""prejudicial dismissal"" needed to be reversed, Riley said.

13,"   By Diane Bartz | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON ConAgra Foods Inc (CAG.N), Cargill Inc CARG.UL and CHS Inc (CHSCP.O) won U.S. antitrust approval on Tuesday to merge their North American flour mill operations after agreeing to sell four mills to a Japanese company.The companies had announced in March 2013 that ConAgra Foods Inc would join Horizon Milling, a joint venture of Cargill Inc. and CHS Inc that is the largest flour miller in America. CHS is owned by farmers and cooperatives. The combined company will be called Ardent Mills.Horizon Milling is already the largest U.S. flour miller, Archer Daniels Midland is the second-largest and ConAgra is No. 3.To secure Justice Department approval, the grain and food-handling companies agreed to sell four mills to Miller Milling Co, a U.S.-based unit of Tokyo-based Nisshin Flour Milling Inc, which is a subsidiary of Nisshin Seifun Group Inc (2002.T). The mills to be sold are Horizon's facility in Los Angeles and ConAgra's facilities in Oakland, California; Saginaw, Texas; and New Prague, Minnesota.""Without the Antitrust Division's required divestitures, the creation of Ardent Mills would have resulted in less competition in the sale of wheat flour, resulting in customers, such as industrial bakers and food service companies, paying higher prices for wheat flour,"" said Renata Hesse, a deputy assistant attorney general at the Antitrust Division.The three companies are pleased with the approval, and the new entity will begin operations around the end of May, the companies said in a joint release.

14,"  (Adds comment from a critic of the approval, details on flour market, paragraphs 9-11)By Diane BartzWASHINGTON May 20 ConAgra Foods Inc, Cargill Inc and CHS Inc won U.S. antitrust approval on Tuesday to merge their North American flour mill operations after agreeing to sell four mills to a Japanese company.The companies had announced in March 2013 that ConAgra Foods Inc would join Horizon Milling, a joint venture of Cargill Inc. and CHS Inc that is the largest flour miller in America. CHS is owned by farmers and cooperatives. The combined company will be called Ardent Mills.Horizon Milling is already the largest U.S. flour miller, Archer Daniels Midland is the second-largest and ConAgra is No. 3. To secure Justice Department approval, the grain and food-handling companies agreed to sell four mills to Miller Milling Co, a U.S.-based unit of Tokyo-based Nisshin Flour Milling Inc, which is a subsidiary of Nisshin Seifun Group Inc .The mills to be sold are Horizon's facility in Los Angeles and ConAgra's facilities in Oakland, California; Saginaw, Texas; and New Prague, Minnesota.""Without the Antitrust Division's required divestitures, the creation of Ardent Mills would have resulted in less competition in the sale of wheat flour, resulting in customers, such as industrial bakers and food service companies, paying higher prices for wheat flour,"" said Renata Hesse, a deputy assistant attorney general at the Antitrust Division. The three companies are pleased with the approval, and the new entity will begin operations around the end of May, the companies said in a joint release.

24,"   By Olivia Oran and Nadia Damouni  ConAgra Foods Inc's long-time chief executive, Gary Rodkin, is expected to retire in the next several months, according to two people familiar with the matter, paving the way for a successor who investors hope can turn around the ailing packaged foods company. The Chef Boyardee maker, which has a market capitalization of $13 billion, is in the early stages of reaching out to potential candidates to succeed Rodkin, the people said, asking not to be named since the matter is confidential.Rodkin, who has been at the helm of ConAgra since 2005, has been under pressure from shareholders to fix problems resulting from the Omaha-based company's troubled $5 billion acquisition of private brands business Ralcorp in January 2013. A ConAgra spokeswoman did not immediately respond to requests for comment. With its purchase of Ralcorp, ConAgra became the biggest U.S. private-label food company. But that business of selling food under supermarket brands has struggled to reach promised profit targets, in part due to cut-price deals Ralcorp had struck with customers before it was taken over. Shares of ConAgra, which were trading at around $30 before the Ralcorp takeover, are now trading at roughly the same level.Rodkin, 62, said in June that the company, which also makes Slim Jim meat snacks and Healthy Choice frozen meals, had underestimated the issues it inherited by buying RalCorp, which had just started to restructure. ""We knew there would be work to do but underestimated the degree of difficulty and the amount of time it would take to course-correct,"" Rodkin said on the most recent earnings conference call. Before the acquisition by ConAgra, Ralcorp was the target of activist investment fund Corvex Management, who had been pushing the company to consider alternatives including a sale. In the most recent quarter ended May 25, ConAgra reported fourth quarter earnings of 55 cents per share, which was lower than its forecast of 60 cents per share. ConAgra's shares have fallen around 9 percent so far this year even as food stocks have climbed across the board. The S&P Food & Beverage select industry index has gained more than 4 percent year-to-date buoyed by large deals like Tyson Foods Inc's $8.55 billion offer for Hillshire Brands Co.

27,"   By Jonathan Stempel  A federal appeals court on Tuesday said ConAgra Foods Inc was not liable for a 2010 fire and explosion at an Illinois flour mill that burned three workers, and overturned much of a nearly $180 million jury award against the packaged foods company and a contractor.The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago said a lower court judge should have granted judgment as a matter of law to ConAgra, whose products include Chef Boyardee pasta, Hunt's ketchup and Peter Pan peanut butter.ConAgra had hired West Side Salvage Inc to help save the contents of a wheat pellet silo at a facility in Chester, Illinois, located about 60 miles south of St. Louis.According to court papers, the silo had been smoldering for several weeks before it exploded on April 27, 2010, injuring Justin Becker, who was employed by West Side, and John Jentz and Robert Schmidt, who were employed by a subcontractor.Jentz suffered burns covering more than 70 percent of his body, while Becker's lungs were scarred from the inhalation of fumes, the papers show. In 2012, after a three-week trial, an Illinois federal jury ordered Omaha, Nebraska-based ConAgra to pay $100 million of punitive damages to the workers and share responsibility with West Side for more than $77 million of compensatory damages.Writing for a three-judge 7th Circuit panel, Circuit Judge Frank Easterbrook agreed that ConAgra was not liable under Illinois law for having hired West Side, an independent contractor, to address an unsafe condition in the silo because the ""feared event"" - the explosion - occurred.""West Side could have negotiated for an indemnity or insurance for its benefit (and that of its workers and subcontractors) but did not do so,"" Easterbrook wrote. The 7th Circuit upheld compensatory damages awards against West Side, but dismissed a punitive damages award. It returned the case to U.S. District Judge Michael Reagan in East St. Louis, Illinois, to decide indemnification issues.""We are pleased with the outcome of this case,"" ConAgra spokeswoman Teresa Paulsen said.ConAgra in court papers had estimated that it could have faced $177 million of liability. In June 2012, it said it believed insurance would cover the damages, minus a deductible. Lawyers representing the plaintiffs did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

53,"   By Anjali Athavaley and Sruthi Ramakrishnan  ConAgra Foods Inc (CAG.N), the maker of Slim Jim beef jerky and Chef Boyardee pasta, said it planned to exit its struggling private label foods business as it seeks to boost profit margins and focus on its faster growing consumer foods segment.ConAgra Chief Executive Sean Connolly, who joined in April, said on the company's earnings call on Tuesday it was clear trying to turn around the private label business was draining resources and that the segment would likely attract significant interest from potential buyers. ConAgra bought Ralcorp in 2013 to become the biggest maker of U.S. private label foods. The business has been plagued with problems ranging from customer service issues to pricing concessions, with sales falling nearly 6 percent in two years.""We know that the inconsistency of our past performance is totally unacceptable,"" Connolly said.ConAgra, like others in the industry, is under pressure to cut costs and accelerate growth as consumers shift away from packaged food to options they consider to be fresher, healthier alternatives.  Earlier this month, activist hedge fund Jana Partners took a 7.2 percent stake in ConAgra, becoming its second-largest shareholder, and said it was prepared to nominate directors to the company's board to help address ""persistent underperformance"" since the $5 billion Ralcorp acquisition.""Today ConAgra acknowledged the need to pursue a new strategic direction,"" Barry Rosenstein, Jana Partners managing partner, said in an emailed statement on Tuesday. ""We look forward to our ongoing discussions with the company and its advisers.""Shares of ConAgra were up 1.7 percent at $44.18 in midday trading.

56,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, July 01 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the Long-term Issuer Default  Ratings (IDRs) for ConAgra Foods, Inc. (ConAgra) and its subsidiary, Ralcorp  Holdings, Inc. (Ralcorp) at 'BBB-' and has affirmed ConAgra's Short-term IDR at  'F3'. The Rating Outlook is Negative.  Fitch views ConAgra's announcement that it will exit the Private Brands  operation and essentially unwind the Ralcorp acquisition (completed just two  years ago) as a credit positive, and the company could use potential proceeds to  pay down debt to bring leverage down to the low 3.0x range in the near term.  However, ConAgra continues to face headwinds in its remaining branded business.  ConAgra would have to demonstrate a meaningful track record in stabilizing its  volumes and market share in the remaining branded and commercial businesses and  a commitment to a conservative financial policy, particularly in the face of  activist interest, to maintain its investment grade rating.  A full list of ratings follows at the end of this release.  KEY RATING DRIVERS ConAgra announced plans to exit its Private Brands operations, essentially  unwinding its $6.8 billion acquisition (or 13.2x EV/EBITDA multiple) of RalCorp  in January 2013. Profitability in the company's private brands business has been  weak. A highly competitive bidding environment, combined with recent  service-related issues and execution shortfalls, have negatively impacted  results and expectations for volume, pricing and margins in that business.  The Private Brands segment generated roughly $4.1 billion in annual net sales  and adjusted EBITDA of approximately $350 million in the fiscal year ended May  31, 2015, accounting for approximately 26% of total revenue and 16% of EBITDA.  Based on recent packaged foods trading and transaction multiples, Fitch  anticipates ConAgra could receive proceeds of $3.2 billion to $4.2 billion based  on a 9x to 12x multiple.  The ongoing business, consisting of Consumer and Commercial operations,  currently generates $11.8 billion annual net sales and $1.7 billion operating  EBITDA. Considering fiscal 2015 year-end total debt of $7.9 billion, ConAgra  would have to pay down approximately $2.3 to $2.6 billion in debt to return  gross leverage to the 3.0-3.2x range. However, activist investor Jana Partners,  which has disclosed a 7% equity stake, could also push for accelerated change  that could result in higher leverage if proceeds are primarily used for  shareholder friendly activities. In addition, should ConAgra even pay down significant debt to bring leverage to  the low 3.0x range given its current comments about maintaining a balanced  capital allocation that includes a leverage target in the two to three times  range, there are significant headwinds in the remaining business. Volumes in its  consumer foods business, which accounts for 46% of revenue and approximately 55%  of EBITDA, have been in the negative 1% to 3% range for the last five years,  offset by only a modest improvement in pricing/mix effect in the 1% range. The  company will need to drive productivity improvements in sg&a, supply chain and  trade spending to support future investments in marketing, infrastructure,  innovation, and acquisitions. In addition, similar to its industry peers, the  company will have to reposition its branded portfolio over the next few years to  exit low to negative growth brands and invest in health and wellness brands  given shifting consumer preferences.  ConAgra plans to outline its long-term financial strategy at an investor event  in the fall of 2015, and Fitch will continue to evaluate the impact of its  various restructuring activities, use of proceeds from the sale of private  brand, and any change in financial strategies that may result from activist  actions.  KEY ASSUMPTIONS --Potential proceeds of $3.2 billion to $4.2 billion for the private brands  business, based on EBITDA multiples in the 9-12x range on adjusted EBITDA of  approximately $350 million.  --Post the sale of the private brand business, ConAgra would have to pay down  approximately $2.3 to $2.6 billion in debt to return gross leverage to the  3.0-3.2x range. --Remaining Consumer and Commercial businesses currently generates approximately  $11.8 billion net sales and $1.7 billion EBITDA. Assuming above mentioned debt  paydown, the company will have to drive operating improvements in its ongoing  business to maintain or improve EBITDA from current levels.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a negative  rating action include: --If weak top line and operating trends continue and gross leverage (total  debt-to-operating EBITDA) remains at or above the mid-3.0x range. Deteriorating  FCF or a sizeable leveraged transaction would also support a downgrade.  Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a positive  rating action include: --the Outlook could be revised to Stable if there is a sustained operational  improvement in fiscal 2016 and beyond, including stable volumes and market  shares in its ongoing businesses, in addition to demonstrating a financial  commitment to maintain leverage in the low 3.0x range. --In the long term, a positive rating action could be supported by consistent  positive volume and market share growth due to an improved brand portfolio,  strong FCF generation, along with a commitment to maintain leverage in the  mid-2x range. This is not anticipated in the intermediate term. LIQUIDITY Ample Liquidity, Manageable Maturities: ConAgra maintains an undrawn $1.5  billion revolving credit facility expiring Sept. 14, 2018 that provides backup  to its commercial paper (CP) program. The company had $183 million cash, which  was mainly outside the U.S., at fiscal 2015 year end. The revolving credit  facility contains covenants that consolidated debt must not exceed 65%, and the  company's fixed charge coverage ratio must be greater than 1.75x on a rolling  four quarter basis. ConAgra's long-term debt maturities primarily consist of $1  billion due in fiscal 2016 and approximately $550 million due in fiscal 2017. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has affirmed the following ratings:  ConAgra Foods, Inc.  --Long-term IDR at 'BBB-';  --Senior unsecured notes at 'BBB-'; --Bank credit facility at 'BBB-';  --Subordinated notes at 'BB+'; --Short-term IDR at 'F3'; --Commercial paper at 'F3'. Ralcorp Holdings, Inc. --Long-term IDR at 'BBB-';  --Senior unsecured notes at 'BBB-'. The Rating Outlook is Negative. Contact:  Primary Analyst Judi M.

67,"   By Anjali Athavaley and Sruthi Ramakrishnan  ConAgra Foods Inc said it would cut about 1,500 jobs and move its headquarters to Chicago from Omaha as part of a plan to save at least $300 million in three years. The maker of Chef Boyardee pasta and Healthy Choice dinners is under pressure to cut costs and accelerate growth as consumers shift from packaged food to options they consider fresher, healthier alternatives. In July, the company added two directors to its board as part of an agreement with Jana Partners LLC after the activist hedge fund took a stake in the company. The job cuts mark the latest changes implemented by ConAgra Chief Executive Sean Connolly, who joined in April. The company also announced in June that it would divest its struggling private-label business.""While we believe that we can create a lot of value with ConAgra Foods, that's only going to happen if we make bold change, and we're going to continue to push for change,"" Connolly said in an interview. He added that the move to Chicago allowed the company to consolidate its consumer foods business in one location. The job cuts, which exclude the private label business, represent about 30 percent of ConAgra's office-based workforce. Overall, ConAgra had about 32,900 employees as of May.  About 1,200 employees will be left in Omaha following the cuts, down from roughly 2,400, excluding ConAgra's private brands workers, Connolly said.Nebraska Governor Pete Ricketts said in a statement that he regretted ConAgra's decision, and that the government would be ready to assist Nebraskans seeking reemployment due to the restructuring.

The other $100 million will come from more efficient spending on promoting products within stores, ConAgra said.""While we view these efforts as prudent, we don't believe ConAgra is poised to post operating margins on par with the midteens generated by industry peers, given its lagging brand set,"" said Morningstar analyst Erin Lash, noting that increased investments in marketing and innovation would partly offset savings.

70,"   By Lauren Hirsch and Greg Roumeliotis  TreeHouse Foods Inc (THS.N) is in advanced talks to acquire Ralcorp, the private label business of ConAgra Foods Inc (CAG.N), in a deal that could be valued between $2.5 billion and $2.7 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.After considering other alternatives, such as selling Ralcorp to a private equity firm or breaking it up, ConAgra is now engaged in negotiations with TreeHouse in an effort to finalize a deal, the people said this week.Ralcorp's spreads, nuts and pretzels business would complement TreeHouse's existing condiment and healthy snacks business, the people said.There is no certainty that an agreement with TreeHouse will be reached, the people said. If talks fail, ConAgra may try again to sell Ralcorp to a buyout firm, the people added.      The sources asked not to be identified because details of the sale process are confidential. ConAgra and TreeHouse declined comment.  Ralcorp's sale would mark the conclusion of a saga that started when private label business Ralcorp, edged on by activist investor Corvex, sold to ConAgra for $5.1 billion two years ago. At the time, the maker of Chef Boyardee canned products and Slim Jim touted the acquisition as an opportunity to become a powerful food giant. Ralcorp, which includes cereal, pasta, crackers, jams and jellies, syrups and frozen waffles, had since been plagued by integration costs and pressured profit margins. ConAgra Chief Executive Officer Gary Rodkin, who helped oversee the acquisition of Ralcorp, left the company earlier this year. Since Sean Connolly joined ConAgra as chief executive in April 2015, the former CEO of the Hillshire Brands Company has sought to revive the business. In his first earnings call in June, he announced intentions to exit the private label business. This month, Connolly announced cost-cutting initiatives that included laying off around 1,500 jobs and moving company headquarters from Omaha, Nebraska to Chicago.In ConAgra's third-quarter earnings, the private brands segment recorded an operating loss of $1.3 billion, due to an impairment of goodwill that the company blamed on a further deterioration of the business.  Connolly has faced investor pressure as well this year, namely from activist hedge fund Jana Partners LLC. ConAgra agreed to two directors to its board, including a former Nestle SA NESN.VX executive, nominated by Jana.ConAgra has said it is hoping to finalize the sale of the private brands business this fall.TreeHouse’s recent purchases include better-for-you snack company Flagstone Foods for approximately $860 million last year.

TreeHouse said it would have pro forma sales of nearly $7 billion and adjusted earnings of about $690 million before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization following the deal, which it expects to close in the first quarter of 2016. In a conference call with analysts, company executives said the deal would give the combined entity a presence in more than 20 product categories and result in savings in procurement and transportation.

The remaining businesses will be renamed as Conagra Brands Inc and will include brands like Orville Redenbacher’s popcorn and Healthy Choice frozen dinners, in addition to several units that are currently a part of ConAgra's commercial foods segment, which serves restaurants and grocers. ConAgra shares rose 4.1 percent to $40.98 in early trading on Wednesday. The tax-free spinoff is expected to be completed in autumn 2016, the company said. ConAgra, which has reported flat or falling sales in four of the past six quarters, is struggling like others in the industry to increase sales and profit margins as consumers in search of healthier options shift from packaged products to fresh foods. The company faced investor pressure this year from Jana Partners LLC and agreed to a board settlement with the activist hedge fund in July. Earlier this month, ConAgra said it will sell its private-label unit to TreeHouse Foods Inc (THS.N) for $2.7 billion so that it could focus more on its portfolio of branded products. And in October, the company said it will cut about 1,500 jobs as part of a plan to save at least $300 million in three years.In an interview, the company's Chief Executive Sean Connolly, who will head Conagra Brands, said that the company had explored various strategic options for Lamb Weston before deciding on the spinoff. He said the move would give the resulting two companies more focus and individual management attention.""You don't have each business competing for the same resources if you're a stand-alone,"" he said. JP Morgan analyst Ken Goldman said in a note that the spinoff may not be the end of the breakup process for ConAgra and that future divestitures could include the commercial foods segment or the company's share in Ardent Mills, the flour-milling joint venture it has with Cargill Inc [CARG.UL] and CHS Inc.Goldman Sachs and Centerview Partners are the company's financial advisers for the transaction and Jones Day and Davis Polk & Wardwell are its legal advisers.

ConAgra shares rose 4.1 percent to $40.98 in early trading on Wednesday.The tax-free spinoff is expected to be completed in autumn 2016, the company said.ConAgra, which has reported flat or falling sales in four of the past six quarters, is struggling like others in the industry to increase sales and profit margins as consumers in search of healthier options shift from packaged products to fresh foods. The company faced investor pressure this year from Jana Partners LLC and agreed to a board settlement with the activist hedge fund in July. Earlier this month, ConAgra said it will sell its private-label unit to TreeHouse Foods Inc for $2.7 billion so that it could focus more on its portfolio of branded products.And in October, the company said it will cut about 1,500 jobs as part of a plan to save at least $300 million in three years. In an interview, the company's Chief Executive Sean Connolly, who will head Conagra Brands, said that the company had explored various strategic options for Lamb Weston before deciding on the spinoff. He said the move would give the resulting two companies more focus and individual management attention.""You don't have each business competing for the same resources if you're a stand-alone,"" he said.JP Morgan analyst Ken Goldman said in a note that the spinoff may not be the end of the breakup process for ConAgra and that future divestitures could include the commercial foods segment or the company's share in Ardent Mills, the flour-milling joint venture it has with Cargill Inc  and CHS Inc.Goldman Sachs and Centerview Partners are the company's financial advisers for the transaction and Jones Day and Davis Polk & Wardwell are its legal advisers.

83,"   By Robert Iafolla  ConAgra Foods Inc did not violate federal labor law when it disciplined a worker for soliciting union membership at the company's Slim Jims manufacturing plant in Ohio, a U.S. appeals court ruled on Friday. A three-judge panel of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously rejected the test for solicitation that the National Labor Relations Board used in the case, which turned on whether the worker presented a union authorization card for signature. Adopting such a standard would throw off the balance between the rights of workers and employers under the National Labor Relations Act, which allows the latter to prohibit workplace solicitation, the panel said.

85,"   By Sruthi Ramakrishnan  TreeHouse Foods Inc (THS.N) said it would introduce more premium, healthy snacks and popular drinks to revitalize the struggling private-label business it bought from ConAgra Foods Inc (CAG.N) last month.TreeHouse's $2.7 billion acquisition of ConAgra's business - its biggest ever - makes it the largest private-label food company in the United States, with 2015 pro-forma sales of about $7 billion.ConAgra's business made cereal, snacks, condiments, pasta, and retail bakery products. This business, now a unit within TreeHouse, will be called TreeHouse Private Brands.TreeHouse plans to introduce ""better-for-you"" gluten-free and organic foods, and foods with less preservatives and more natural colors to boost sales in the new business, Chief Financial Officer Dennis Riordan told Reuters on Wednesday.""Products that are in that premium and better-for-you classifications have been rising at a rate of about 40 percent a year,"" Riordan said. Analysts had questioned the rationale of the acquisition as ConAgra had struggled to turn a profit in the business since it bought private-label foods company Ralcorp in 2013 for $5.1 billion.The business, under ConAgra, had been plagued by integration costs and customer service problems as well as low profit margins due to price concessions to customers. Riordan, however, played down concerns, saying problems with the business were mainly because of a lack of investments in new products and formulations.The key will be to make that business relevant to retailers again, he said.TreeHouse's sales increased nearly 9 percent last year, on the back of a 28 percent jump in sales in 2014 when the company bought trail mix maker Flagstone Foods. The company supplies private label products to supermarkets, specialty retailers, foodservice distributors and restaurant operators.TreeHouse plans to expand its offerings of ""on-trend"" beverages, which include iced teas and fruit drink mixes and is also open to more acquisitions to boost its healthy food offerings, Riordan said, but declined to give further details.

Net sales slid to $2.83 billion from $3.13 billion in the fourth quarter ended on May 29. Analysts on average had expected $2.89 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

It expects to complete the spin-off this fall.""Company management is doing all the right things currently by reshaping the company and getting its focus back,"" said Jack Russo, an analyst for Edward Jones.

100,"   By Melissa Fares  ConAgra Foods Inc (CAG.N) on Thursday reported a 9.5 percent drop in quarterly net sales, missing analysts' estimates as demand weakened for its consumer foods, which include Chef Boyardee pasta and Hunt's ketchup.The company's shares fell 2 percent in early trading despite its earnings meeting expectations, but subsequently traded down slightly at $47.48, off 0.25 percent.ConAgra said it expects earnings per share for the current quarter to show double-digit comparable growth year-over-year. Net sales slid to $2.83 billion from $3.13 billion in the fourth quarter ended on May 29. Analysts on average had expected $2.89 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net income attributable to the company dropped to $117.6 million, or 27 cents per share, from $209.2 million, or 48 cents per share, a year earlier.   Excluding one-time charges and discontinued operations, earnings of 52 cents per share were in line with analysts' estimates.The company, which will move its corporate headquarters to Chicago from Omaha, Nebraska, this quarter, announced plans in November to spin off its Lamb Weston frozen potato business into a separate public company. It expects to complete the spin-off this fall.""Company management is doing all the right things currently by reshaping the company and getting its focus back,"" said Jack Russo, an analyst for Edward Jones. ""Challenge will be growing sales going forward,"" he added. The remaining company will be renamed ConAgra Brands Inc and include products like Orville Redenbacher’s popcorn and Healthy Choice frozen dinners, in addition to several units that are now part of the commercial foods segment, which serves restaurants and grocers.""We're squarely focused on Lamb Weston to really succeed on its own,"" Chief Executive Officer Sean Connolly told Reuters.    ""We think the market will recognize the attractiveness of this really good business.""Chief Financial Officer John Gehring said that because most of the food company's business is in North America, Britain's  exit from the European Union will not affect it much. However, he said there have been some initial indications that ConAgra will experience some slight headwinds  around some of the currency moves in Mexico and Canada.""We're not overly exposed in Europe,"" Gehring added.ConAgra's stock is up roughly 13 percent in the year to date, while the S&P 500 is up 1.3 percent in the same period.

126,"  TreeHouse Foods Inc (THS.N) cut its full-year profit forecast due to weak results at its newly acquired private label business and announced the departure of an executive who had a key role in making the company the largest U.S. private label food maker.TreeHouse, whose shares tumbled as much as 21 percent on Thursday, boosted its private label business when it closed the $2.7 billion-acquisition of ConAgra Foods Inc's (CAG.N) private label in February.The results at the business fell short of TreeHouse's expectations in the third quarter and sales in the current quarter would not be enough to stem the declines, Chief Executive Officer Sam Reed said in a statement.The company – which also owns brands such as Bay Valley Foods and Flag Stone Foods – cut its full-year adjusted earnings forecast to $2.80-$2.85 per share from $3.00-$3.10, pinning the blame squarely on the underperforming private label business.TreeHouse also said President Christopher Silva would leave. The departure, which comes three month after Chief Financial Officer Dennis Riordan said he would quit, will leave the company without the two key executives that helped orchestrate and implement the ConAgra deal. ""We are disturbed by the departure of Chris Silva, the #2 executive of the company, following last quarter's announcement of the retirement of CFO Dennis Riordan,"" SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst William Chappell Jr. wrote in a note.TreeHouse said Riordan would replace Silva as president on an interim basis and appointed Matthew Foulston, a Compass Minerals International Inc (CMP.N) executive, as its chief financial officer.ConAgra itself had struggled to make a profit from the private label business that was plagued by integration costs, customer service problems and low profit margins due to price concessions. TreeHouse's forecast signals that company executives were not conservative enough in their previous estimate and/or the private brands business was even more damaged than they realized, Chappell said. He cut his rating on the stock to ""hold"" from ""buy"".The company also said it would close a manufacturing plant in Delta, British Columbia and cut 100 of the 160 jobs at a plant in Battle Creek, Michigan – both of which it acquired as part of the ConAgra deal. The Oak Brook, Illinois-based company also reported lower-than-expected profit and sales for the third quarter ended Sept. 30.""The third quarter was a tale of two cities,"" CEO Reed said. ""Our legacy business continued to perform well ... while the Private Brands business showed sequential improvement, its results fell short of our expectations.""

129,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, November 21 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Conagra Brands, Inc.'s  (Conagra) long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'BBB-'. The Rating Outlook  has been revised to Positive from Stable. A full list of ratings follows at the  end of this release. The Positive Outlook recognizes Conagra's evolution to a business model that  should align well with the largest U.S. packaged food companies, given the  potential for low-single digit organic growth and a mid-teens operating margin  structure. Following a series of divestitures Conagra is emerging as a pure play  portfolio of generally strong branded businesses. Given the company's focused  investments in product innovation and marketing, Fitch believes the company  could stabilize sales beginning fiscal 2018 (ending May 2018) after several  years of modest declines. Positive rating momentum would occur upon evidence of  stabilization in sales and upward momentum in operating margin from the current  13% level, while maintaining leverage within 3x. KEY RATING DRIVERS Transition to Pure Play Branded Packaged Food Firm: Conagra has transitioned to a pure play branded packaged food company over the  past year by divesting and spinning off its private brand and commercial  businesses. In July 2015, the company announced plans to sell the private label   business (fiscal 2015 sales of approximately $4.1 billion and EBITDA of $370  million), acquired in January 2013, which had been generating weak operating  performance due to a highly competitive bidding environment, combined with  service-related issues and execution shortfalls. In February 2016, the company  completed the sale to Tree House Foods, Inc., for $2.6 billion in cash. Conagra  used a majority of the proceeds to pay down debt and ended fiscal 2016 with  leverage of 2.8x compared to 3.6x in fiscal 2015.  The company also generated approximately $488 million in net proceeds from the  July 2016 sales of Spicetec Flavors & Seasonings and JM Swank businesses. On  November 9, 2016, the company completed the separation of ConAgra Foods, Inc.  into two publicly traded companies, Conagra Brands, Inc. and Lamb Weston  Holdings, Inc. (Lamb Weston), which is the frozen potato business previously  classified under its commercial segment. Lamb Weston generated approximately $3  billion in revenues and $593 million in adjusted EBITDA in fiscal 2016. Conagra  retired $1.44 billion in debt and received a cash distribution of $823.5 million  following the spinoff, with leverage further declining to 2.2x.  Excluding the divested businesses, Conagra generated $8.2 billion in revenues  and approximately $1.4 billion in EBITDA in fiscal 2016, which compares to $15.8  billion in revenue and $2.2 billion in EBITDA in fiscal 2015 prior to the  divestitures. 90% of the predominantly branded business is based in North  America with 85% of the business going through the retail channels. Despite the  presence of some tertiary brands in the company's portfolio, 80% of sales were  generated from brands with #1 or #2 category positions such as Marie Calender's,  Hunt's, Slim Jim and Reddi-wip.  Over the medium term, Conagra is targeting low-single digit organic sales growth  driven by focused investments in brands with higher growth potential and product  innovation. The company is repositioning some of its major brands such as  Banquet (approximately $850 million in retail revenues) at a higher price point,  with the aim of achieving higher EBIT dollars despite some initial losses.  Conagra is also working to revitalize some of its brands by improving the food  quality and packaging as well as supporting brands through disciplined  advertising and controlled promotions.  The repositioning cost 4% in top line in fiscal 2016 and the impact is expected  to be similar in fiscal 2017 but realized product margins have improved and  should support EBIT dollar growth over the next few years should the company be  able to stabilize volume beginning fiscal 2018. The company expects to support  its low single organic sales growth with the acquisition of premium food brands  such as its recent purchase of the packaged foods business of Frontera Foods,  Inc. to reorient the brand mix towards changing consumer preferences that favor  more specialty, natural and organic options.  Margin Enhancement Initiatives Underway: Conagra's EBIT margins in the low-teens at 12.8% in fiscal 2016, below the  average 18.4% for the four largest U.S. packaged food companies (with a range of  15.5% - 25%). The company attributed its lower margins to sales being volume  driven and offering under-priced and over-promoted products, which it is  addressing by resetting its volume base at higher price points. Conagra improved  its adjusted gross margin 260 bps to 29.1% in fiscal 2016 and Fitch expects  there could be another 150-200 bps opportunity over the next two to three years.  In addition, Conagra is implementing a $300 million efficiency program, which  includes $$200 million in SG&A reductions and $100 million of trade efficiency.  These initiatives focus on cost-saving opportunities in procurement,  manufacturing, logistics, and customer service, as well as general and  administrative overhead levels.  Fitch expects EBIT margin to trend towards 15%-16% over the next 24 months.  Fitch's expectations are lower than the company's medium term target of 32% for  gross margin and 16.5% for operating margin, given that our sales growth  expectations are lower at flat to modestly positive annually and our assumption  that the company will have to reinvest some of the savings back into the  business in order to drive top-line as major packaged food companies vie for  share in a low growth sector.  Leverage Expected to be Sustained within 3x: The company paid down approximately $2.5 billion of debt in fiscal 2016  following the private brands divestiture as well as the $550 million notes that  matured in July 2016. Post the spin-off of Lamb Weston, Conagra has  approximately $3.5 billion in total debt, which includes the retirement of an  additional $1.4 billion of notes, resulting in leverage of 2.2x. M&A is an important part of Conagra's long-term growth strategy and Conagra  could issue $1 billion in incremental debt for a bolt on acquisition while  maintaining leverage within 3x. A potential risk to its current rating is a  transformative transaction that drives leverage beyond 3.5x on a sustained  basis. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's assumptions in its base case projections are as follows: --Revenue is expected to be approximately $7.8 billion in fiscal 2017, pro forma  for the spin-off of Lamb Weston. Organic growth is expected to be flattish to  modestly positive over beginning fiscal 2018.  --Gross margin is expected to grow to 30% in fiscal 2017 and improve modestly  thereafter to 31%.  --EBIT margin is expected to improve to approximately 15% over the next 24  months, while EBITDA is expected to trend towards the $1.5 billion range.  --FCF is expected to be approximately $350 million - $400 million annually over  the next 24-36 months. Fitch expects this to be directed towards the company's  share buyback program but could also be used for bolt-on acquisitions.  --Total debt/EBITDA is expected to be within 3x. RATING SENSITIVITIES Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a negative  rating action include: --Execution of the company's strategic plan such that organic growth is in the  low-single digit range and operating margins improve to high-teens, bringing the  company in line with the industry average.  --Leverage (total debt-to-operating EBITDA) is sustained under 3x. Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a negative  rating action include: --If the company loses momentum and organic sales growth remains modestly  negative, or a sizeable debt financed acquisition occurs, such that leverage  (total debt-to-operating EBITDA) trends towards the mid-3.0x range. LIQUIDITY Ample Liquidity, Manageable Maturities: Pro forma for cash proceeds from the  Lamb Weston spin-off, Conagra had a cash balance of $1.5 billion as of August  28, 2016. The company maintains an undrawn $1.5 billion revolving credit  facility expiring September 14, 2018 that provides backup to its commercial  paper program. The company had no amount outstanding under its commercial paper  program.  FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has affirmed the following ratings: Conagra Brands, Inc. (previously ConAgra Foods, Inc.) --Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'BBB-';  --Bank credit facility at 'BBB-';  --Senior unsecured notes at 'BBB-'; --Subordinated notes at 'BB+'; --Short-term IDR at 'F3'; --Commercial paper at 'F3'.
