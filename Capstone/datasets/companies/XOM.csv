0,"  * Wholesale gasoline prices jump in US Midwest* Marathon, Valero, Exxon, PBF confront cold* Many problems seen short-livedHOUSTON, Jan 7 Frigid weather rattled several U.S. refiners on Tuesday, temporarily affecting production from Canada to Tennessee, and boosting wholesale gasoline prices in the Midwest more than 7 cents a gallon.Marathon Petroleum Corp. said its 120,000-barrel-per-day (bpd) Detroit refinery lost instrument air due to freezing temperatures, while Valero Energy Corp.  reported its 180,000 bpd Memphis refinery had a ""system shutdown believed to be due to low temperatures in the area,"" according to a filing with state and federal regulators.Those notices came one day after an equipment shutdown due to cold weather at Exxon Mobil Corp's 238,000 bpd Joliet, Illinois refinery. Exxon said the refinery was back to normal operations on Tuesday. The company did not describe the malfunction but said it resulted in releases through its flare stacks.Gasoline for Midwest markets outside of Chicago climbed 7.5 cents a gallon on Tuesday to a discount of 15 cents a gallon to  the February RBOB gasoline contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange, traders said.Gasoline for delivery to the Chicago market rose 5.35 cents  to an offer price of 12 cents a gallon under February RBOB, traders said. Citgo Petroleum Corp said its 174,500 bpd Lemont, Illinois refinery was ""running at planned rates"" while ""working its way through minor issues caused by low ambient temperatures.""Cold weather can pose significant challenges to refiners. Some refinery units operate at nearly 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit (540 degrees Celcius). Oil and other feedstocks running through plant pipelines are heated to 300 or 400 degrees. Sudden deep drops in temperature can cause liquids to freeze - leading to breakdowns or piping ruptures.And there can be problems like that cited by Marathon at its Detroit plant. Instrument air links to sensors used to monitor the status of equipment at refineries. Without instrumentation, most refinery units go to flaring to prevent a problem until the sensors can be fixed. Energy industry intelligence company Genscape reported on Tuesday that a gasoline-making fluid catalytic cracking unit was shut down late Monday at Marathon's Detroit refinery.The outages at Marathon and Exxon appeared to be short-lived. Marathon said it was beginning the process of restarting the affected units.Other refineries were not so lucky.In Canada, North Atlantic Refining Ltd's Come by Chance refinery in Newfoundland was still offline following power cuts in the region that started on Thursday, before a blizzard hit the area and two days before a fire at a power substation, local media reported. Flaring, emissions and power trouble were reported at several other U.S. refineries on Tuesday, though weather was not immediately cited as a contributing factor.Flaring reportedly occurred at Marathon's 212,000 bpd Catlettsburg Refinery in Kentucky and PBF Energy Inc's  182,200 bpd refinery in Delaware City, Delaware.Traders said PBF's 160,000 bpd refinery in Paulsboro, New Jersey, was shut by a power outage.Just as cold weather was spreading across the United States, Monroe Energy LLC, a unit of Delta Air Lines Inc, started planned maintenance on a crude unit and isocracker at its 185,000 barrel per day (bpd) refinery in Trainer, Pennsylvania.IIR, an energy market intelligence provider, reported that some units at the plant were shut on Friday and would be shut for 30 days, though a company spokesman on Monday could not specify when the work started.Genscape reported brief, elevated flaring on Friday at the refinery.",2014-01-07,XOM,"Tue Jan 7, 2014 | 5:35pm EST",UPDATE 2-Frigid temperatures snarl some U.S. refinery operations,http://www.reuters.com//article/refinery-operations-weather-idUSL2N0KH1CJ20140107?type=companyNews

4,"  SINGAPORE Jan 21 Exxon Mobil Corp said on Tuesday its new hydrotreater has started operations and is producing ultra-low sulphur diesel at its 592,000 barrels per day (bpd) Singapore refinery.The new unit will increase the facility's daily low-sulphur diesel capacity to 25 million litres or about 157,000 barrels. Of that, about 36 percent or 57,000 bpd will meet ultra-low sulphur diesel specifications, the company said in a statement.With the new unit, the refinery is able to produce both 50 and 10 parts per million (ppm) low sulphur diesel. Ultra-low sulphur diesel, commonly used to fuel vehicles and equipment such as tractor trailers, buses and marine vessels, is becoming a more commonly required fuel in Asian countries trying to control air pollution and potentially hazardous emissions. ExxonMobil has put diesel hydrotreaters into its refineries in Baytown and Baton Rouge in the United States, Antwerp in Belgium, Sriracha in Thailand and Yanbu in Saudi Arabia.

Santos has a 13.5 percent interest in the $19 billion PNG liquefied natural gas (LNG) project, which it said was over 90 percent complete. The project is operated by Exxon Mobil .Santos is also developing the Gladstone LNG project in Queensland state, one of seven under construction in Australia to meet demand for gas in Asia.

8,"  KIEV Jan 27 The signing of a gas production-sharing agreement between Ukraine and an international consortium led by U.S. major Exxon Mobil  has been postponed for the second time in a row, Ukraine's fuel and energy minister said on Monday.""We will sign it (the agreement) in February,"" Eduard Stavytsky told reporters in brief remarks after an official briefing. He did not give a reason for the fresh delay.The government orginally intended to sign the deal, which is expected to bring Ukraine several billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas per year, in November but Stavytsky postponed the decision until January due to mass anti-government protests in Kiev. In 2012, Ukraine selected a group of companies led by Exxon Mobil to explore conventional gas deposits in the southern Skifska area on the Black Sea shelf, which has a potential output of 3 bcm of gas per year. The postponed deal would have formalised a production sharing agreement for these deposits. In December, Russia agreed to cut gas prices for Ukraine by a third after Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich walked away from a trade agreement with Europe.

9,"  HOUSTON Oil producer ConocoPhillips (COP.N) outshone larger competitors on Thursday with a quarterly profit that beat expectations as it moved to overcome the problems of high costs and lack of fresh reserves that have nagged at Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L).ConocoPhillips, the largest U.S. oil company without refining operations, said its profits were helped by the sale of its Algerian business and by higher crude oil production in North America.The company shed its refining business in 2012 and has sold billions of dollars of lower-yielding assets to focus on more profitable oil production from North American shale basins such as the Eagle Ford in south Texas.Analysts said Conoco's plan is beginning to pay off at a time when the industry faces pressure from shareholders to lift returns despite flat oil prices and rising costs for risky exploration work designed to replace reserves.Conoco's profit in the fourth quarter was $2.5 billion, or $2.00 a share, compared with $1.4 billion, or $1.16 a share, a year earlier.Excluding special items, profits inched down, though analysts characterized Conoco's reserve replacement ratio, a measure of a company's ability to find new oil and gas reserves to replace what is produced, as strong.On a preliminary basis, Conoco's proved reserves rose 3 percent from a year earlier to 8.9 billion barrels of oil equivalent (BOE). Proved organic reserve additions are expected to be about 1.1 billion BOE for a replacement ratio of 179 percent of 2013 production.In a note to clients, Ed Westlake of Credit Suisse dubbed Conoco the best performing large oil company, citing 7 percent growth in cash flow despite asset sales, a reduced share count and more cash on the balance sheet.""I think we're seeing pretty good evidence that the strategy is working,"" Jeff Sheets, Conoco's chief financial officer, said, citing cash margin growth and expected gains in production. Conoco's shares rose slightly, while those of Occidental Petroleum Corp (OXY.N), the fourth-largest U.S. oil and gas company, edged lower even though it reported a quarterly profit that beat expectations.At $2.04 per share, Occidental's earnings were significantly higher than the 42 cents per share earned a year earlier, when the company wrote down the value of gas properties in the U.S. midcontinent by $1.1 billion.SHELL, EXXON At Shell, Chief Executive Ben van Beurden, just a month on the job, set out plans to make the world's No. 3 investor-owned oil company leaner, putting a new focus on increasing cash, while scrapping an Arctic drilling program. ""Our overall strategy remains robust, but 2014 will be a year where we are changing emphasis, to improve our returns and cash flow performance,"" van Beurden said. ""Our returns are at this point in time too low to be considered competitive.""This year, Shell plans to slash spending to $37 billion from $46 billion and to increase asset dispositions to $15 billion - about 6.5 percent of its $228 billion market capitalization - from $1.7 billion in 2013.The promises, along with a higher dividend, helped lift Shell's shares 1 percent to 2,147 pence.Shell's fourth-quarter earnings, excluding identified items and on a current cost of supply basis, came in at $2.9 billion, 48 percent lower than in the year-before quarter but in line with the downgraded forecast Shell gave on January 17, making the quarter its least profitable for five years.

14,"  By Ernest Scheyder     Jan 31 Chevron Corp plans to keep spending roughly $40 billion per year for the next several years on new oil and natural gas projects in a bid to lift production that is on track to be flat for the third straight year.     That stay-the-course approach, announced on Friday after the second-largest U.S. oil company said its quarterly profit dropped 32 percent, spooked investors and prompted the stock to fall 3.5 percent, the most of any large energy producer this quarter.     Like Exxon Mobil Corp, Royal Dutch Shell  and other international energy companies, Chevron has tried to offset declining production at its existing oil and natural gas wells by spending massively on new exploration projects.       But Shell announced earlier this week that it would focus more on energy projects that have the best chance of success, cutting spending and also selling underperforming assets. The news boosted Shell's stock.      Chevron has taken the opposite approach and plans to keep the cash flowing. It spent $41.9 billion last year on energy projects, a 23 percent increase from 2012. Chevron Chief Executive John Watson said he expects capital spending to be in the $40 billion range for the next few years.     Chevron is betting that its relatively high dividend yield for the energy industry and its large stock buyback program will appease investors until five of its major projects, including two massive liquefied natural gas projects in Australia and deepwater wells in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, are online.     ""Basically it's a treadmill,"" said Oppenheimer & Co analyst Fadel Gheit. ""Yes, all these new projects will add oil. But guess what, until they hit that goal, their base line production is declining.""     Chevron's oil and natural gas production fell 3.4 percent in the fourth quarter to 2.6 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boed).     Rising production in the United States and Nigeria wasn't enough to offset declining production at legacy fields around the world, which typically see production slip 4 percent annually, Chevron said.      For 2014, Chevron expects total production of 2.6 million boed, up only 0.5 percent from 2013 levels. The estimate missed Wall Street's expectations and disappointed investors, who had hoped 2014 would be a ""positive transition year"" toward 2017 when new projects come online, Credit Suisse analyst Edward Westlake said in a note.     Even if Chevron hits its 2014 production goal, it would only be on par with 2012 levels.          Looking forward, Chevron said it has made significant progress on its five main growth projects. In total, the five new protects will add 500,000 boed in production, the company estimates, once fully online.      ""We are in a depleting resource business, and you do need to add to the portfolio,"" Watson said on a conference call with investors.     Last year the company said by 2017 it expects daily production to be 3.3 million boed.          The company reported net income of $4.93 billion, or $2.57 per share, compared with $7.25 billion, or $3.70 per share, in the year-ago period.     The quarterly profit met expectations of Wall Street analysts, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.     The results were not a total surprise to Wall Street, as Chevron hinted earlier this month that its fourth-quarter profit would be ""comparable"" with third-quarter results, when it posted net income of $4.95 billion.        In refining, profit plunged 58 percent due to shrinking margins, largely due to price differentials between different types of crude oil.      Refiners make more money when the price difference between various types of crude oil is wide. When the gap narrows in the price differences, costs tend to rise. Exxon on Thursday posted weakness in its own refining unit.      Profit also fell in Chevron's smallest unit, the power generation and mining unit.     Chevron shares fell $4.02, or 3.5 percent, to $112.40 in afternoon trading. The stock is down about 2.4 percent over the past 52 weeks.

15,"   By Valerie Volcovici | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Feb 12 A group of investors with combined assets of over $200 billion filed shareholder resolutions on Wednesday with ten energy companies, including Exxon Mobil and Southern Co, demanding they disclose their strategies for competing in a lower-carbon future.Led by the New York State Comptroller's office, which alone handles $160 billion in assets, the investors focused on the companies' ""carbon asset risk,"" or the potential for their carbon-intensive assets to lose value as market forces and potential regulation threaten demand for fossil fuels and related infrastructure.The move is part of an ongoing effort by some major institutional investors, coordinated by the sustainability advocacy group Ceres and the Investor Network on Climate Risk, that is focused on holding companies accountable for these so-called ""stranded assets.""The activists have been asking companies whose fortunes are linked to fossil fuels to assess under both a business-as-usual and a low-carbon scenario the risk of stranded assets and the physical risk from the impacts of climate change. ""The energy companies we invest in need to go back to the drawing board to determine the long-term financial risks that climate change poses to their business plans,"" said New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli.His office also filed shareholder resolutions with Devon Energy Corp, an oil and gas producer based in Oklahoma, and the Ohio-based utility FirstEnergy Corp. The bank HSBC said in a 2013 report that the equity valuation of some oil producers could drop by 40 to 60 percent under a low-carbon scenario, in which countries take measures to reach a long-term United Nations target for lower pollution.In order for the world to achieve the UN-agreed goal of limiting global temperature increases to 2 degrees C, the International Energy Agency said last year that no more than a third of the world's proven fossil fuels can be consumed by 2050. ""These companies are producing the vast majority of climate-changing emissions and now is the time for them to reduce risk,"" said Danielle Fugere, president of As You Sow, which works on corporate social responsibility issues with companies including Coca Cola, Chevron and HP.""If they are not preparing to survive in a carbon-constrained future, we expect shareholders will sit up and take notice,"" Fugere said.In December, a report by the non-profit Climate Disclosure Project showed that many large U.S. companies, from oil majors to retailers, are including the potential for carbon emissions fees in their strategic plans.",2014-02-12,XOM,"Wed Feb 12, 2014 | 10:03am EST",Investor group demands fossil fuel companies disclose carbon asset risk,http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-climate-disclosure-idUSL2N0LH0PB20140212?type=companyNews

19,"   By Byron Kaye and Florence Tan | SYDNEY/SINGAPORE  SYDNEY/SINGAPORE Top global oil trader Vitol SA VITOLV.UL is buying Royal Dutch Shell's (RDSa.L) Australian refinery and petrol stations for about $2.6 billion in its biggest acquisition, looking to grab a share of a growing oil product market.The purchase will pit Swiss-based Vitol against arch rival Trafigura TRAFG.UL, which became Australia's largest independent fuel retailer last year in a market where the less nimble oil majors are looking to cut losses.Australia has become one of Asia's biggest fuel importers, creating opportunities for traders as the majors have shut older, small refineries, under pressure to shift investment to oil and gas production that generates better returns.The Australian deal puts Shell comfortably on track to hit its target of $15 billion in asset sales over the next two years, set by new chief executive Ben van Beurden as part of an austerity drive following a profit warning in January.So far this year, Shell has sold about $5 billion of assets and analysts said the swift pace of disposals could prompt the company to raise its target.""The speed at which Shell can sell relatively immaterial assets for billions of dollars highlights how unambitious its $15 billion program is. We would expect the disposal target to be raised in due course,"" Investec analysts said.Vitol Chief Executive Ian Taylor said he expects to make good returns from the business eventually, as the refinery, while small, was a high-quality plant, with good distribution chains into the Australian market.Analysts said the acquisition made sense for Vitol even though Shell couldn't run it profitably enough to keep it.""These two companies have different return expectations and targets they're willing to accept,"" said Craig Pirrong, Professor of Finance at the University of Houston.With the Australian purchase, which includes 870 service stations plus Shell's bulk fuels, bitumen and chemicals businesses, Vitol is betting Australian fuel demand will continue to grow faster than in Europe, and eventually the world will be short of refining capacity. ""Longer term, yes, we are making a bet that refining will actually be a cyclically good business. And that's what we've found so far, by the way,"" Taylor told reporters in Melbourne, hours after signing the deal at the refinery in nearby Geelong.It was also attracted to the country as it has a free market, in contrast to other places in Asia where oil product prices are heavily controlled, Taylor said.He said Vitol would not be interested in a stake in the retail business China's Sinopec Corp (0386.HK) has put up for sale.Shares in Shell traded up 0.2 percent at 6.32 a.m. ET, in line with Britain's bluechip index .FTSE.HOTBED FOR TRADERS  Dutch-owned Vitol has refining operations in the United Arab Emirates and Antwerp, and formed a joint venture with private equity firm Carlyle Group (CG.O) in December called Varo Energy to own refining and distribution assets in Switzerland and Germany.Taylor confirmed that the Abu Dhabi Investment Council sovereign fund was part of the group that bought the assets, but declined to name other parties who may take an equity stake in the deal, which is expected to be partly debt funded.Vitol joined the race for the Australian petrol stations after Trafigura's Puma Energy arm bought two fuel distributors last year.Others eyeing the market include South Korean refiner S-Oil (010950.KS), which said last month it was in exclusive talks to buy a stake in Australia's United Petroleum, a privately owned business valued at about A$1 billion, including debt, that received a number of approaches from international companies following Puma's takeover of Ausfuel.Australia's refineries, owned by Shell, BP (BP.L), ExxonMobil (XOM.N) and Caltex (CTX.AX), have mostly booked losses over several years as tighter fuel quality standards and mega-refineries in Asia have made them uncompetitive. Rather than spend money on upgrading plants, the majors have been looking to sell them or turn them into fuel import terminals. Taylor said Australia was likely to need more fuel terminals in the long run, an opportunity Vitol would look at.SELL-OFF Shell, which retains substantial gas interests in Australia as well as a $7 billion stake in Woodside Petroleum (WPL.AX), was making tough choices to improve its overall competitiveness, CEO van Beurden said in a statement.Analysts and bankers say Shell may consider selling its 23.1 percent stake in Woodside to help meet its $15 billion disposal target, which equates to about 6 percent of Shell's market value.The company generated $1.7 billion of divestment proceeds last year.Earlier this week, Shell offloaded its Italian retail business for an undisclosed price, reported in the Italian press as to 500 million euros. In January, it also sold a stake in a gas project in Western Australia for $1.1 billion and a stake in a Brazilian oil project for $1 billion.It has already sold downstream assets including refineries in the UK, Germany, France, Norway and the Czech Republic.""The new (Shell) management is being ruthless in cutting out anything that they think is extraneous to their core,"" said Al Troner, President of Asia Pacific Energy Consulting in Houston.(Additional reporting by Sonali Paul in MELBOURNE and Cezary Podkul in NEW YORK and Sarah Young in LONDON; Editing by Richard Pullin and Erica Billingham)",2014-02-21,XOM,"Fri Feb 21, 2014 | 6:39am EST","Vitol pays $2.6 billion for Shell's Australian refinery, petrol stations",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-australia-companies-shell-idUSBREA1K02820140221?type=companyNews

23,"  OLYMPIA, Wash. Feb 28 Nearly 25 years after the Exxon Valdez oil spill off the southern coast of Alaska, sea otters in the most affected parts of Prince William Sound have recovered to their pre-spill numbers, a federal report released on Friday showed.Several thousand sea otters died in the aftermath of the oil tanker running aground on Bligh Reef and leaking 42 million liters of crude oil into the sound in March 1989, according to the U.S. Geological Survey, which issued the report.The report's findings underscore the lengthy recovery times for many species affected by oil spills, U.S. Geological Survey research biologist Brenda Ballachey said in a statement. ""Although recovery timelines varied widely among species, our work shows that recovery of species vulnerable to long-term effects of oil spills can take decades,"" said Ballachey, the study's lead author.Scientists assessed the otters' recovery by using aerial surveys, measuring oil exposure as indicated through gene expression and by evaluating the animals after death. After the spill, middle-aged otters died at a higher-than-normal rate - a trend that has since reverted to the pre-spill pattern of most otters dying either very old or very young, the study found. The slow pace of recovery for the otters was likely due to their ongoing exposure to oil, the study found.Sea otters were among more than 20 near-shore animal species damaged by the spill, the U.S. Geological Survey said.

24,"  NEW YORK Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N), the world's largest publicly traded energy company, said on Wednesday it expects oil and natural gas production to be flat this year as overall spending falls 6 percent to about $39.8 billion.Investors who had expected production growth sent shares down 3 percent in earlier trading. The company's current outlook for output, provided at an annual meeting with investors, was adjusted from a year-earlier to exclude some volume from Iraq and Abu Dhabi, the company said.""We took a set of low margin barrels off the base,"" Exxon Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson told investors.Evan Calio, an analyst with Morgan Stanley, noted at the meeting that oil and gas production growth has been ""elusive"" for Exxon.In recent years, Exxon and other large oil companies have invested record amounts on exploration and production projects to boost oil and gas output.

37,"  * Coast Guard says no timeline for reopening Houston Channel* Exxon says channel closure has not affected Baytown refinery* Second barge collision on Houston Channel this month   (Updates with statements for Coast Guard commander, Exxon)By Terry WadeTEXAS CITY, Texas, March 22 Four skimming boats surrounded a partially submerged barge on Sunday at the entrance to the Houston Ship Channel, working to clean up fuel spilled from the vessel into Galveston Bay after a Saturday collision with a cargo ship, according to a Reuters eyewitness.The Houston Ship Channel remained shut on Sunday to contain the environmental damage and prevent additional collisions,  said Coast Guard Capt. Brian Penoyer, who commands the maritime safety service's units in Houston and Galveston, Texas.The Channel will remain shut ""until clean water is assured,"" Penoyer told reporters at a news conference in Texas City.Eight refineries accounting for nearly 12 percent of U.S. refining capacity are cut off from crude oil tankers while the 53-mile (85-kilometer) waterway linking the busiest U.S. petrochemcial port to the Gulf of Mexico is shut.The channel closure has not affected production at Exxon Mobil Corp.'s 560,500 barrel per day (bpd) Baytown, Texas refinery, the nation's second largest, a company spokesman said on Sunday afternoon. Penoyer said an estimated 4,000 barrels or 168,000 gallons (636,000 liters) of fuel oil were spilled due to the collision.A local official said the channel was expected to be shut for all of Sunday and possibly Monday. The official asked not to identified as the information had not yet been made public.The Coast Guard said crews completed pumping the remaining fuel oil in the barge's undamaged tanks onto another ship. Next, the Coast Guard will have to move the barge from it's location at the entrance to Galveston Bay.The Ship Channel is 55-foot (17-meter) deep pathway for barges and deep-draft ships cut into the floor of Galveston Bay, which averages 20 feet (6 meters) in depth. The closure also affected shipping along the Intracoastal Waterway where it intersects the Ship Channel.Carnival Corp's Carnival Magic cruise liner was delayed on Sunday from returning to the Port of Galveston due to the spill, according to a Carnival spokesman.Penoyer said the Coast Guard was making arrangements to allow the Carnival Magic and the Carnival Triumph, due in Galveston on Monday, to dock.The Carnival Magic has supplies of food and water aboard for the guests, Carnival spokesman Vance Gulliksen said. The Carnival Magic was due to leave Galveston on Sunday afternoon. The barge is operated by Kirby Inland Marine. A Kirby operated barge carrying fuel oil collided with a ship carrying rice at nearly the same location on March 14. In that accident, the cargo ship was damaged, but no fuel oil was spilled.This is a far smaller spill than that by the Exxon Valdez tanker, which struck a reef in Prince William Sound, Alaska, in 1989.A total of 11 million gallons of heavy black crude oil were estimated to have been released by the Exxon Valdez.In contrast, only one tank on the barge was ripped open by the collision with the cargo ship in the Houston Channel on Saturday, releasing an estimated 168,000 gallons.Wildlife Response Services, a Texas-based wildlife rehabilitation service, is helping affected birds and marine life. The service has not said how many animals have been received for cleaning.In addition to four skimming vessels working on the spill, another 20 response vessels were standing by to help with the cleanup on Sunday, the Coast Guard said. About 90,000 feet of boom were staged along the Texas City dike for containment deployment.Emergency response crews have also laid down floating barriers in hopes of containing the spill.

A Coast Guard spokesman declined to discuss the timeline.Even earlier, officials had said the channel could remain shut for several more days. Penoyer explained that traffic can't move again until there's no more oil in the water to cling to ships and be carried further. Also, any ships that were touched must be cleaned before moving through water deemed sufficiently clean, he said.The closure of the channel on Saturday has led to a queue of more than 80 vessels trying to move into or out of the Gulf of Mexico. Shipping delays forced Exxon Mobil Corp to cut production at its largest refinery.Exxon said production at its 560,500 barrel per day Baytown, Texas, refinery had been cut on Monday due to the closure of the Houston Ship Channel. The company expects further production cuts by mid-week if the channel remains shut. INVENTORIES CONSIDERED AMPLE Analysts on Monday were largely unconcerned, noting that ample inventories in the region provide a cushion for refiners.But a senior engineer at a Houston-area refinery that depends on crude deliveries through the ship channel was concerned about the requirement that the water be cleaned of any thick fuel oil before ships run back and forth to ensure they don't track it further upstream or into the Gulf.""We're toast,"" the engineer said. ""I would say this is a big problem. Any delay is bad, but three days or more is really bad because we use the channel to bring crude and products in and out."" The ship channel was shut on Saturday after a collision between a Kirby Inland Marine oil barge and a cargo ship, spilling some 4,000 barrels, or 168,000 gallons (636,000 liters), of residual fuel oil. The channel allows oil barges and cargo ships to sail from the Gulf Coast to refiners and terminals further inland.Penoyer said the thick viscosity of the oil made it recoverable by skimmers.A total of 39 ships were waiting to leave the port of Houston and 43 ships were waiting to come in, the Coast Guard said on Monday afternoon. Penoyer said a typical day in the channel includes movement of 60 to 80 large ships - tankers, freighters, containers and cruise ships - and 300 to 400 tug and barge movements.A warning to mariners issued by the Coast Guard on Sunday said portions of the Houston channel and its offshoots to Texas City and Galveston, Texas, along with a portion of the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway, could be closed through March 29 or longer, depending on the requirements of a cleanup. Five ships waited to come into the ports of Texas City and Galveston, Texas, and 12 ships waited to leave the ports, the Coast Guard said.Kirby Inland Marine is operated by Kirby Corp.Penoyer said Kirby ""immediately"" stepped forward to take responsibility for the response costs by hiring the cleanup crews.Cleanup crews have pumped all of the remaining fuel oil from the barge, which has been refloated and moved to a different position near the site of the collision in the channel.Marathon Petroleum Corp. declined on Monday to discuss operations at its 451,000-bpd Galveston Bay Refinery and 80,000-bpd Texas City refinery. Royal Dutch Shell's joint-venture 327,000 bpd Deer Park refinery was evaluating supply impacts and had contingency plans to mitigate them, a spokeswoman said.Fewer than 10 oil-covered birds have been recovered for cleaning, according Texas wildlife agencies.(Reporting by Erwin Seba in Houston, Selam Gebrekidan in New York, Terry Wade in Orlando; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe, Stephen Powell, Bernard Orr and Cynthia Osterman)",2014-03-24,XOM,"Mon Mar 24, 2014 | 6:15pm EDT",Houston ship lane to have 'tapered' reopening; Exxon cuts output,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-usa-oil-spill-idUSBREA2M01H20140324?type=companyNews

A total of 39 ships were waiting to leave the port of Houston and 43 ships were waiting to come in, the Coast Guard said on Monday afternoon. Penoyer said a typical day in the channel includes movement of 60 to 80 large ships - tankers, freighters, containers and cruise ships - and 300 to 400 tug and barge movements.A warning to mariners issued by the Coast Guard on Sunday said portions of the Houston channel and its offshoots to Texas City and Galveston, Texas, along with a portion of the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway, could be closed through March 29 or longer, depending on the requirements of a cleanup.Five ships waited to come into the ports of Texas City and Galveston, Texas, and 12 ships waited to leave the ports, the Coast Guard said.Kirby Inland Marine is operated by Kirby Corp.Penoyer said Kirby ""immediately"" stepped forward to take responsibility for the response costs by hiring the cleanup crews.Cleanup crews have pumped all of the remaining fuel oil from the barge, which has been refloated and moved to a different position near the site of the collision in the channel.Marathon Petroleum Corp. declined on Monday to discuss operations at its 451,000-bpd Galveston Bay Refinery and 80,000-bpd Texas City refinery. Royal Dutch Shell's  joint-venture 327,000 bpd Deer Park refinery was evaluating supply impacts and had contingency plans to mitigate them, a spokeswoman said.Fewer than 10 oil-covered birds have been recovered for cleaning, according Texas wildlife agencies.

40,"   By Charlie Zhu | HONG KONG  HONG KONG State-run oil giant China Petroleum and Chemical Corp (Sinopec Corp) (0386.HK) aims to complete the sale of up to 30 percent of its sprawling marketing business in the third quarter of this year, a restructuring analysts say could raise $10-$20 billion.Sinopec (600028.SS) unveiled a plan last month to restructure the business, which includes over 30,000 petrol stations - the world's largest fuel retail network - and more than 20,000 convenience stores at these stations. The business also includes oil-products pipelines and storage facilities across China.Chairman Fu Chengyu told reporters on Monday Sinopec plans to set up a holding company for the marketing assets - with a current unaudited value of around 300 billion yuan ($48.19 billion) - by the end of March and will start to bring in capital from around the end of June.""The restructuring will be one of the two strategic measures taken by our company this year. Our marketing business (has) huge potential that has yet to be unlocked,"" Fu told the briefing a day after Sinopec reported its 2013 earnings.The company's other top priority this year is to develop its shale gas business, Fu said, adding that Sinopec was targeting production capacity of 5 billion cubic meters by 2015 and 10 billion cubic meters by 2017.RETAIL EXPERTISE EYED The aim of the restructuring is to boost the value of the low-margin marketing business, shore up the group's deteriorating finances and reinforce investment in exploration and production, analysts say. Fu said Sinopec will use funds raised from the sale to boost shale gas output and upgrade refineries.Sinopec is seeking both domestic and foreign investors, preferably companies with sales experience in sectors other than energy, but priority will be given to domestic institutions as per the government's policy to share the ""dividend"" of China's economic growth, Fu said.Deep-pocketed domestic financial investors would be the most likely buyers of Sinopec's marketing business, industry specialists said, partly because these institutions would be content with a minority stake and a longer investment horizon. A person familiar with Fu's thinking told Reuters Sinopec was keen to partner with an e-commerce company to make most use of its retail network.Sinopec is putting its marketing business on sale after the government pledged in November to let the private sector play a bigger role in the economy.Industry specialists familiar with global oil majors' downstream strategies say Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L), Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) and BP (BP.L) may all shun the sale due to an expected lack of management control of the business.Globally, most of them are also shrinking their downstream operations to focus on high-margin exploration and production activities. On Sunday, Sinopec reported a 35 percent drop in fourth quarter net profit, steeper than expected, as improved profitability at its refining division was offset by a dip in upstream earnings.It said it would cut capital expenditure to 161.6 billion yuan ($25.96 billion) this year from 168.6 billion yuan in 2013 - which was already seven percent lower than budgeted.Shares in Sinopec, which has a market value of $98 billion, closed up 3.6 percent in Hong Kong on Monday, beating a 1.9 percent gain for the benchmark Hang Seng Index .HSI.($1 = 6.2250 Chinese yuan)(Fixes typo in first paragraph)(Additional reporting by Twinnie Siu; Editing by Anne Marie Roantree and Miral Fahmy)",2014-03-24,XOM,"Mon Mar 24, 2014 | 5:33pm EDT",Sinopec aims to complete mega marketing asset sale in third quarter,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-sinopec-idUSBREA2N1QK20140324?type=companyNews
41,"  * Coast Guard says no timeline for reopening Houston Channel* Exxon: Channel closure has not affected Baytown refinery* Second barge collision on Houston Channel this month   (Updates with notice to mariners on length of closure, birds affected)By Terry WadeTEXAS CITY, Texas, March 24 The closure of major Texas shipping channels that deliver crude to more than a tenth of the nation's refining capacity was set to run into a third day and could continue through the week as crews were still working on Sunday night to clean up after an oil spill.The Houston Ship Channel, which allows oil barges and cargo ships to sail from the Gulf Coast to refiners and terminals further inland, was shut on Saturday following a collision between a Kirby Inland Marine oil barge and a cargo ship, spilling some 4,000 barrels, or 168,000 gallons (636,000 liters), of residual fuel oil.A warning to mariners issued by the U.S. Coast Guard on Sunday said portions of the Houston Ship Channel and its offshoots to Texas City and Galveston, Texas, along with a portion of the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway could be shut through Saturday March 29 or longer depending on the requirements of the cleanup. Kirby Inland Marine is operated by Kirby Corp.There were signs of progress on Sunday. Coast Guard Capt. Brian Penoyer said cleanup crews have pumped all remaining fuel oil from the barge, which is partially sunken near the entrance to the channel. The barge has been refloated and moved to a different position near the site of the collision in the channel.The channel will remain shut ""until clean water is assured,"" Penoyer told reporters at a news conference in Texas City. A local official said the channel was expected to be shut well into Monday. The official asked not to be identified as the information had not yet been made public.The outage has yet to impact operations at Exxon Mobil Corp.'s 560,500 barrel-per-day (bpd) refinery in Baytown, Texas, the nation's second-largest, company spokesman Nicolas Scinta said.Representatives for seven other refineries in Houston and Texas City, Texas, did not reply to requests for information about possible reductions in production.As of Sunday evening, 40 ships were waiting to depart the port of Houston and 35 were waiting to enter. Another seven ships were waiting to leave Texas City; five were waiting to sail to that refining hub. CRUISING TO PORT Late on Sunday, Carnival Corp.'s cruise liner Carnival Magic docked at the port of Galveston with special permission from the Coast Guard. Carnival's ship Carnival Triumph will be allowed to dock on Monday morning.Both Carnival Magic and Carnival Triumph are scheduled to depart Galveston on Monday. A Kirby-operated barge carrying fuel oil collided with a ship carrying rice at nearly the same location on March 14. In that accident, the cargo ship was damaged, but no fuel oil was spilled.The Ship Channel is a 55-foot (17-meter) deep pathway for barges and deep-draft ships cut into the floor of Galveston Bay, which averages 20 feet (6 meters) in depth.The spill is far smaller than that by the Exxon Valdez tanker, which struck a reef in Prince William Sound, Alaska, in 1989. A total of 11 million gallons of heavy black crude oil were estimated to have been released by the Exxon Valdez.In contrast, only one tank on the barge was ripped open by the collision with the cargo ship in the Houston Channel on Saturday, releasing an estimated 168,000 gallons.Wildlife Response Services, a Texas-based wildlife rehabilitation service, is helping affected birds and marine life.Fewer than 10 birds covered with oiled have been sighted and brought in for recovery, said the Coast Guard.As of Sunday evening, 24 vessels are skimming from the waterway, the Coast Guard said. More that 69,000 feet of floating barriers have been deployed to contain the spill. Another 141,000 feet of barriers are on standby for use if needed.

42,"  HOUSTON, March 31 Exxon Mobil Corp, the world's largest publicly traded oil company, said on Monday that risks related to climate change pose little risk to its oil and gas reserves because the resources will be needed to meet expected growth in energy demand.Responding to queries from shareholder activists, the company also said it is ""confident"" that none of its oil and gas reserves will lose value or become ""stranded"" if governments act to slash carbon emissions.""We believe producing these assets is essential to meeting growing energy demand worldwide, and in preventing consumers - especially those in the least developed and most vulnerable economies - from themselves becoming stranded in the global pursuit of higher living standards and greater economic opportunity,"" Exxon said in a report released in response to call from activist shareholders.Earlier this month, the Irving, Texas-based company agreed to detail the risks climate change poses to its carbon assets in exchange for the withdrawal of a shareholder proposal on the issue. The resolution, filed by investors from As You Sow and Arjuna Capital, cited studies suggesting that lower demand or prices for fossil fuels might emerge in coming years as a result of climate change or greater carbon regulation. Based on its previously published long-term outlook, Exxon expects the world to require 35 percent more energy by 2040 and greenhouse gas emissions are expected to plateau in that period.While governments could take action that affects Exxon, the company said it is ""highly unlikely"" that governments would restrict greenhouse gas emissions 80 percent over the next 30 years. To mitigate risk from climate change, Exxon has a ""constant focus on efficiency"" and looks for ways to reduce emissions from its own operations, it said.Also on Monday, the latest report from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said in a report that global warming poses a growing threat to the health, economic prospects and food and water sources of billions of people.

43,"  WASHINGTON A U.S. regulator on Monday allowed Exxon Mobil Corp to restart operations on the Texas leg of its Pegasus pipeline, which spilled thousands of barrels of oil into a residential area in Arkansas last year.The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) approved Exxon's restart plan for a 210-mile (338-km) stretch of the pipeline from Corsicana to Nederland at 80 percent of the operating pressure in place before the March 29, 2013 incident in the small town of Mayflower, Arkansas.""This margin of safety should allow for the safe operation of the pipeline until the Remedial Work Plan can be approved and implemented,"" PHMSA said in a letter to Exxon dated and made public on March 31.The northern portion of the pipeline, which includes Mayflower, will remain shut down under the terms of a corrective action order, a PHMSA spokesman said.Pegasus, built in the late 1940s, ruptured near a housing development in Mayflower and spewed around 5,000 barrels of crude. The 95,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) pipeline runs from Patoka, Illinois, to Nederland. It is unusual for pipelines to leak near or in towns and the incident led to the evacuation of residents, as Exxon launched a huge cleanup operation and paid residents' expenses.It also fueled the debate over the safety of transporting Canadian oil, as this pipeline did, from tar sands, with critics claiming this type of crude was more corrosive to pipelines. In November, the U.S. regulator accused Exxon of failure to account for risks in the pipeline and said the oil major could face nearly $2.7 million in fines.The restart of the southern portion of the pipeline will allow Exxon to carry out inspections in the summer, as expected in Exxon's remedial plan, according to PHMSA. The regulator said it will not extend a deadline to submit the plan beyond April 7, 2014. The shutdown of the Pegasus line led to a delay late last year of a 40,000-bpd Sunoco Logistics pipeline project that would carry crude from Midland, Texas, to Nederland, a crossroads for several pipelines and home to oil terminals.Sunoco declined to comment on the project, saying it usually gives updates during earnings calls.(Reporting by Timothy Gardner in Washington and Selam Gebrekidan and Sabina Zawadzki in New York; Editing by Franklin Paul, Meredith Mazzilli and Paul Simao)",2014-03-31,XOM,"Mon Mar 31, 2014 | 3:17pm EDT",U.S. allows partial restart of Exxon pipeline a year after spill,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-usa-exxon-mobil-pegasus-idUSBREA2U1IO20140331?type=companyNews

46,"  * Russia, West in standoff over Ukraine* Rosneft building LNG plant with ExxonMobil* Rosneft to launch plant by 2018-19, sees gas output up   (Adds details, background)By Denis PinchukMOSCOW, April 1 Russia's Rosneft, said on Tuesday it was on track to start production at its first liquefied natural (LNG) gas plant in the country's far east in 2018-2019, despite East-West tension over Ukraine.The world's largest listed oil company by output signalled its partnership with U.S. ExxonMobil for building the plant, which will have an initial annual capacity of 5 million tonnes, would not be affected by the standoff.""The project is fully targeting Asia-Pacific markets. At the moment, the project's implementation is going according to the plans that were announced,"" Rosneft, headed by Igor Sechin, a long-standing ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, said in written replies to Reuters.""The launch is planned for 2018-2019,"" said the state-controlled company, almost 20 percent owned by British oil major BP.Rosneft said current LNG prices in Asia, at over $15 per million British thermal units (MMBtu), would enable it to successfully carry out its LNG project, in which the final investment decision is expected next year. Russia is entering the global LNG game at a time when Qatar, Australia and others are boosting their presence on the market, and prices are being driven by growing demand in the Asia-Pacific region.Russia has only one LNG plant, which is controlled by state-run top natural gas producer, Gazprom, and is on the Pacific island of Sakhalin. It has an annual capacity of around 10 million tonnes.EAST-WEST STANDOFF  Tensions over Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine, following a referendum the West says was a sham, have pushed East-West to their lowest level since the Cold War.The United States and the European Union have imposed sanctions, mainly on Russian individuals, and Moscow has responded in kind.Rosneft is one of two Russian companies that have won the right to ship LNG out of Russia since the Kremlin decided to end Gazprom's monopoly. The other is Novatek, which is currently Russia's number two gas producer and is co-owned by another Putin ally, Gennady Timchenko.Timchenko is one of the Russian individuals targeted by Western sanctions over the Ukraine crisis but Sechin has not been targeted, nor has Gazprom's chief executive, Alexei Miller. The tensions have spurred U.S. officials to press Washington to speed up exports of U.S. natural gas to Europe to help reduce the continent's reliance on Russian gas, which accounts for a third of the EU's total consumption.Rosneft said it did not expect all LNG plants announced by Washington to come on stream, saying exports could hit domestic gas prices and curb economic growth in the United States and  competition would come from Canada, with its own LNG plans.""That said, a scenario when the bulk of the projects announced are actually launched seems unlikely,"" Rosneft said.Russia largely underestimated the shale gas revolution in the United States which turned the country into the world's leading gas producer, enabling it to overtake Moscow.The United States is now set to become the world's largest oil producer, thanks to increase in shale oil output, and Russia is now testing its own unconventional oil prospects in western Siberia.Last year, Rosneft's gas production reached 42 billion cubic metres (bcm), thanks to acquisitions. The company plans to increase gas output to 100 bcm by 2020 in a move to become Russia's second biggest gas producer after Gazprom.On Tuesday, it said its gas output was expected to rise to around 55 bcm this year and over 63 bcm next year. Gazprom produced 479 bcm last year, or 73 percent of the Russian total.

47,"  (Adds trader comment)SINGAPORE, April 1 Oil liquids from ExxonMobil's  gas export project in Papua New Guinea will be blended into the country's only crude blend, the company said Wednesday, almost doubling crude exports by the middle of the year.ExxonMobil's $19 billion PNG LNG Project is due to begin exports of 6.9 million tonnes of liquefied natural gas (LNG) per year around mid-2014.Along with LNG, the project will produce about 25,000 barrels per day (bpd) of condensate, a low-density mixture of hydrocarbon liquids that will be blended into Papua New Guinea's existing export stream, the Kutubu Blend, a spokeswoman for the project said.The additional volumes will result in an almost doubling in production of the Kutubu Blend, Papua New Guinea's only export grade made up of the Kutubu, Gobe, Moran and SE Mananda crude streams. Production of the blend currently stands at around 30,000 bpd, an industry source said. Kutubu is normally sold in cargoes of 650,000 barrels with 1-2 cargoes per month exported to regional refiners. Exports will rise to 2-3 monthly cargoes by the middle of the year. The first cargo of the new blended Kutubu crude will be marketed by project partner Oil Search Ltd, the spokeswoman said.As a result of condensate in the mix, the new Kutubu Blend will become lighter with an API of around 49 compared to 44-45 now, an industry source said. A trader said the quality changes would not be significant, however the rise in number of monthly cargoes could make the blend more attractive to regional refiners seeking steady supply of light sweet crude.The higher crude exports from impoverished Papua New Guinea come amid stagnating crude production in a region that is increasingly dependent on crude imports. Asian refiners import more than twice the volume of crude produced regionally, and Asia is estimated to need an additional 300,000 bpd of low-sulphur or sweet crudes in 2014 compared with last year.A total of 200 million barrels of associated liquids are expected to be produced over the LNG project's 30 year life, Oil Search Ltd said on its website.Other shareholders in the PNG LNG Project include Australia's Santos Ltd. and Japan's JX Nippon Oil & Energy Corp.

Eli Lilly and Takeda have said they would dispute the verdict, which could include appeals to a higher court or filing motions asking the trial judge to set aside or reduce the verdict.""Although there's no mathematical bright line"" to determine how high is too high when it comes to punitive damage awards, federal appeals courts generally scrutinize the ratio of punitive to compensatory damages, preferring those that fall into the single-digit range, according to Professor Catherine Sharkey, a tort law expert at New York University School of Law.Punitive damages are meant to discourage companies from bad conduct. Compensatory damages are meant to pay victims for their actual losses. With a ratio of more than 6,100 to 1 of punitive to compensatory damages, the Actos award could be highly vulnerable.""It's definitely the case that the U.S. Supreme Court has signaled to lower courts that they should be restraining very large punitive awards,"" Sharkey added. Lilly, which co-promoted Actos from 1999 to 2006, said in a press release it will be indemnified by Takeda for its losses and expenses around the litigation based on the terms of its agreement with Takeda.Takeda's shares fell as much as 8.8 percent to an eight-month low in Tokyo trading on Tuesday after the verdict. The stock ended 5.2 percent lower at 4,572 yen.Lilly shares fell 0.2 percent, or 12 cents per share, to $58.50 per share in New York Stock Exchange trading. The massive award was met with ""stunned silence"" in the  Lafayette, Louisiana, courtroom, plaintiffs' lawyer Mark Lanier said.Lanier acknowledged it was not certain whether the damages award would be sustained.""Nobody has gone out and bought a new home,"" Lanier said. ""This is a conservative judge and a conservative court and she's very 'balls and strikes.' We're not under any grand illusion.""The $9 billion in punitive damages awarded by the jury against Takeda and Eli Lilly exceed the $5 billion penalty that a jury in Alaska imposed on Exxon Mobil Corp for the Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989.The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2008 that the previous Exxon Valdez award had been ""excessive."" The company was ultimately ordered to pay $500 million. That and other rulings have been read as limiting punitive damages in federal cases.Lanier said the jury deliberated for only an hour and 10 minutes to deliver its verdict finding liability on all 14 questions, and 45 minutes longer to come out with the multibillion-dollar punitive damages.The allocation of liability for compensatory damages was  75 percent for Takeda and 25 percent for Lilly, according to Lilly.Takeda said judgements were entered in Takeda's favor in all three previous Actos trials, while this was the first federal case to be tried in a consolidated multidistrict litigation comprising more than 2,900 lawsuits.Last May, a U.S. judge had nullified a separate jury verdict for $6.5 million against Takeda after ruling that the plaintiffs failed to offer any reliable evidence that Actos had caused cancer.Germany and France suspended use of the drug, a multibillion-dollar seller, in 2011 because of concerns about a possible link to cancer.The case is In Re: Actos Products Liability Litigation Case U.S. District Court, Western District Louisiana, No. 6:11-md-2299.

""But there's not a project until all those pieces come together. LNG projects by their nature take time."" The proposed project, which could potentially be exporting gas by 2023 according to regulatory filings, is one of several planned for British Columbia's Pacific coast to export gas from Western Canada's massive shale fields. However none of those projects, including facilities planned by Chevron Corp, Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Malaysia's Petronas  have yet to begin construction. Kruger said Imperial and Exxon, which has a 69.6 percent stake in the Canadian company, are laying the groundwork for the LNG project. The two are firming up the size of their available natural gas resources, finding customers, looking at transportation options and waiting for clear fiscal and regulatory rules that will govern the project. ""If you are waiting to wake up one morning with a major announcement, these projects are not like that,"" he said.Imperial's project, known as WCC LNG, is expected to produce as much as 30 million tonnes of liquefied gas per year.

65,"  * Rosneft's CEO Sechin says company needs to export gas* Sechin says Gazprom, Shell deny Rosneft, Exxon access to pipeline   (Adds detail, quotes)By Denis DyomkinKHABAROVSK, Russia, April 25 Rosneft  ratcheted up pressure on fellow Russian energy champion Gazprom  on Friday, asking the government to intervene in a row with the gas producer as Rosneft seeks to strengthen its control over vast hydrocarbon resources.Rosneft, headed by Igor Sechin, a powerful ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, has long challenged Gazprom's monopoly rights to export natural gas via pipelines, which so far serve only clients in Europe, where Gazprom generates over half of its revenues.On Friday, Sechin again called on the government to allow it to export gas via pipeline and asked for help in gaining access to Gazprom's trunk gas pipeline, vital for the liquefied natural gas (LNG) project Rosneft is planning with ExxonMobil.Sechin said that since Rosneft has large gas resources of gas in sparsely populated Eastern Siberia, it needs to sell the excess abroad. ""East Siberia has gas reserves in excess of 7 trillion cubic metres... And domestic demand has been limited so far. The task of expanding export capabilities arises in conditions like that, of course, including for independent (non-Gazprom) producers,"" Sechin told a government meeting in the far eastern city of Khabarovsk.Rosneft and Russia's No.2 gas producer Novatek  have secured rights to export seaborne LNG, successfully challenging Gazprom's monopoly.Gazprom still retains exclusive rights to export gas via pipelines, which so far have only been plugged to clients in Europe where the company generates half of its revenues. Gazprom has been in talks for over a decade with China about selling it pipeline gas, but was unable to reach a deal due to differences over pricing. Sources said that the deal could be clinched in May when Putin visits China.Rosneft has said it want access to a yet-to-be-built pipeline to China.LNG PROBLEMS  Rosneft and ExxonMobil plan to build an LNG plant in Russia's Far East to produce 5 million tonnes per year of the frozen gas starting from 2018. However, the project has been hindered by infrastructure bottlenecks and uncertainty over gas reserves.Last week, Putin approved expansion plans for an LNG plant, operated by Royal Dutch Shell and majority-owned by Gazprom, on the Pacific island of Sakhalin.Analysts have said that would hinder implementation of Rosneft and Exxon's LNG project.Sechin told the meeting, presided over by Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, that both Gazprom, a monopoly owner of trunk pipelines, and Shell were denying his company access to a pipeline from Sakhalin to the mainland for the LNG project.""We believe those denials run counter to the law. We would ask you to provide support over the access (to the pipeline),"" Sechin said.

On a total return basis, energy is up more than 7 percent since Feb. 25, compared with a gain of just over 2 percent for the S&P 500 and a loss of 1.8 percent on healthcare, the worst-performing sector in that period.""These big energy companies that pay dividends and have solid buyback programs are more defensive in nature as long as the price of the underlying commodity holds up,"" said Mike O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut.Both Exxon and Chevron rank among the top 10 dividend payers in terms of absolute dollars, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. With a price-to-earnings ratio of 14.2, significantly below the S&P 500's 17.8, energy should continue to attract investors as the rotation to value continues. ""A lot of the major oil companies are entering the next phase of their life cycle, where there's more of an emphasis on profitability and cost control,"" said Faisel Khan, senior oil equity analyst at Citi in New York.""We think that returns have a pretty good chance of growing from here.""Halliburton Co, the world's No.2 oilfield services provider, said last week that their customers are stepping up spending to drill and complete wells as operating budgets swell. Schlumberger Ltd and Baker Hughes Inc also spoke of improved markets in North America. According to the U.S. Federal Reserve, capacity utilization in the oil extraction sector currently sits at 99.2 percent of total capacity, far exceeding the average over the previous 40 years of about 92 percent.So far in this earnings period, 14 energy names have reported results, with 11 - or 79 percent - exceeding estimates, making energy No. 1 among sectors with more than 10 companies reporting.""With investors generally underweight Big Oils, there are early signs that significant negative consensus EPS revisions are likely leveling off,"" said Asit Sen, an analyst at Cowen & Co, referring to earnings per share estimates in a note this week.(Wall St Week Ahead appears every Sunday.

69,"  (Adds Chevron no comment; Exxon, BP ties to Russia)MINSK, April 29 Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Tuesday that Moscow saw no need for counter sanctions against the West, but could reconsider the participation of Western companies in its economy, including energy projects.""We would very much wish not to resort to any measures in response. I hope we won't get to that point,"" he told reporters after meeting with the leaders of Belarus and Kazakhstan.""But if something like that continues, we will of course have to think about who is working in the key sectors of the Russian economy, including the energy sector, and how.""The United States on Monday unveiled a new round of sanctions aimed at business leaders and companies close to Putin, while the European Union followed up on Tuesday by naming 15 Russians and Ukrainians to its blacklist, moving to freeze assets and deny visas.""Regarding the second package, it's not clear at all what this is linked to, because there is no cause and effect link with what is happening now in Ukraine and Russia,"" he said. SIGNIFICANT TIES Though some Western oil companies left Russia in recent years because of a difficult business climate, U.S. companies Exxon Mobil and Chevron Corp, along with British major BP, have significant ties there. Igor Sechin, the head of state-controlled Rosneft, was named in the latest U.S. sanctions, though not his company, in which BP holds an 18.5 percent stake.In Russia, Exxon Mobil's net acreage holdings in Sakhalin at the end of 2013 totaled 85,000 acres, all offshore, and its net acreage in the Rosneft joint venture agreements for the Kara and Black Seas was 11.3 million acres. The two companies also have a joint venture to evaluate the development of tight-oil reserves in western Siberia.In the United States, Rosneft unit Neftegaz in March 2013 bought a 30 percent stake in 20 deepwater exploration blocks held by Exxon in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Exxon Mobil declined to comment on Putin's latest comments on Tuesday.Meanwhile, Chevron Corp owns a 15 percent stake in the Caspian Pipeline Consortium, which transports crude oil from Kazakhstan through Russia to the Black Sea. The company also sells lubricants in Russia used in engines for ships and agricultural equipment.Chevron declined to comment on Putin's latest statements, but said it was monitoring the region closely.Putin reiterated his accusations that the United States was orchestrating the Ukraine crisis and urged Kiev and pro-Russia protesters to respect the Geneva agreements, reached on April 17 and intended to defuse the crisis, and sit down at the negotiation table.The United States and European Union accuse Moscow of orchestrating an uprising of pro-Russian separatists in southeastern Ukraine. The crisis has brought relations between the West and Russia to their lowest since the end of the Cold War.

70,"   By Marianna Parraga | HOUSTON, April 30  HOUSTON, April 30 Argentina's Neuquen province expects major global energy companies, including Royal Dutch Shell, Chevron Corp and Exxon Mobil Corp , to bid in a May auction of 11 oil blocks, its energy minister said on Wednesday.The exploration and development blocks include conventional and unconventional oil and gas resources, most of them in the vast Vaca Muerta shale formation, considered one of the world's biggest shale deposits.The results are expected for August.""For unconventionals, the players will be the majors,"" Neuquen Energy Minister Guillermo Coco said in Houston on a road show to attract foreign capital. ""Chevron, Exxon, Shell have shown interest in Vaca Muerta. They will compete for sure.""Companies interested in participating would have to form joint ventures with the provincial oil company, Gas y Petroleo de Neuquen (GyP), with 50-90 percent stakes, depending on the block size and resources. ""We want to be the minority stakeholders in all the unconventional projects and also be an important stakeholder in conventional developments,"" Coco added.According to Argentine law, it is possible for companies to form consortia to develop conventional and unconventional resources separately in a single block. President Cristina Fernandez has given the provinces more leeway to set up energy development programs, a reflection of the huge resources needed to exploit the fields.The Neuquen basin's crude output was 224,000 barrels per day (bpd) in 2013, more than a third of the country's production, and it also produced 2.2 billion cubic feet per day, according to the regional government's figures.The first bidding round in Neuquen was held from 2008 to 2009 and there have been another two rounds since. At least 57 blocks have been assigned and some of the properties given back to GyP are being re-offered. In the first round, the regional government did not demand access bonds as will be the case in this round. Companies could pay as much as $80 million to access mid-sized areas.The crude produced in the new areas has to be sold to refineries in Argentina through individual supply contracts, the minister added.He expects that this will not be an issue, even though the controlled internal gas price is the cause of frequent complaints from operators working in the country.U.S.-based Chevron has been the most active foreign oil company in Vaca Muerta in partnership with Argentine state-run  company YPF SA.

82,"  * Putin closely associated with investment forum* Western firms see impact of Ukraine crisis on business* Russia heading into recession, growth seen falling   (Adds companies, economic data, markets, quotes)By Katya Golubkova and Timothy HeritageMOSCOW, May 7 Western investors from a bank to a brewer reported trouble in their Russian operations on Wednesday due to the Ukraine crisis, while the Kremlin suggested Washington was trying to sabotage President Vladimir Putin's flagship economic forum.French Bank Societe Generale wrote down the value of its Russian subsidiary, Danish brewer Carlsberg  blamed the rouble's weakness for lower profits, and Britain's  Imperial Tobacco Plc said conditions in Russia had hurt its overall business in growth markets.So far Western sanctions over Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in March have mainly targeted only individuals close to Putin and steered clear of trying to inflict serious damage on the economy.Russian shares and the rouble surged on Wednesday after Putin called for separatists in eastern Ukraine to postpone a planned referendum on secession and backed diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis.However, capital is flooding out of Russia just as it most needs foreign investment to support a faltering economy, and analysts forecast the rouble will fall to new lows against the dollar in the coming year.Putin's press secretary Dmitry Peskov said top U.S. executives were coming under pressure to stay away from the St Petersburg International Economic Forum later this month, at which the president is due to deliver the keynote address.The annual investment gathering, Russia's answer to the Davos World Economic Forum, usually attracts an A list of global company bosses but the White House has said it would be inappropriate for heads of big U.S. firms to attend this year.Chief executives conspicuous by their absence from the May 22-24 event include the heads of aluminium producer Alcoa Inc , energy firm ConocoPhillips, Citibank, General Electric and International Paper.""As we know, many U.S. companies have faced direct unprecedented pressure... They are deciding whether to go or not to go to the forum but not on their own,"" Peskov told RIA news agency, adding that Putin had not altered his agenda for the forum.The Forum aims to showcase Russia as a place to invest but  has not always succeeded in persuading executives worried by red tape, corruption and poor legal protection. The battle will be particularly hard this year with the economy sinking into recession and hit by the U.S. and European Union sanctions. Highlighting the problems of investing in Russia, and citing uncertainty over Ukraine, Societe Generale said it had booked a 525 million euro ($731 million) writedown on the value of its Russian unit, Rosbank.Carlsberg reported a fall in first-quarter operating profit because of the rouble's weakness and poor sales in eastern Europe.Imperial Tobacco said in a report for the six months to March 31 that its ""overall share position in growth markets was slightly down, impacted by conditions in Russia"". Cigarette companies are relying on growth markets, largely in developing  countries, to offset dwindling sales in the developed world.Analysts said conditions are deteriorating. ""The outlook for sales and earnings in Russia and Ukraine for the rest of the year and in 2015 is worsened every day that goes by without the crisis getting solved,"" Morten Imsgard from Sydbank said.MESSAGE TO PUTIN  Russia annexed Crimea after the ousting of pro-Moscow Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovich in February, and since then the separatists have taken over several towns and cities in the largely Russian-speaking east of the country.Western governments accuse Moscow of being behind the separatist moves in eastern Ukraine but Russia denies this.Although the White House says it has not forced businessman to boycott the forum, President Barack Obama is sending the message that it cannot be business as usual with Russia.White House spokesman Jay Carney said officials had been discussing the forum with business leaders, and had made clear that attending would not be appropriate given ""flagrant violations of a sovereign nation's territorial integrity"".Some Russian companies and individuals have faced sanctions over the events in Ukraine, such as asset freezes and visa bans, including some of Putin's inner circle but not Putin himself.The U.S. pressure over the forum, however, indirectly hits Putin himself. His face features on the forum's website, the event is closely associated with him personally and each year the president uses it to make a rallying cry for investment. Russia, the world's top oil producer, needs foreign investment and know-how for the energy sector, where advanced drilling technology is needed to unlock Arctic and shale oil deposits.GROWTH FORECASTS DOWN The International Monetary Fund last week forecast 0.2 percent growth this year and said the economy was already ""experiencing recession"". Russia's credit rating was cut by Standard and Poor's last month to one notch above junk status.The rouble is down nearly 8 percent against the dollar this year and capital flight, nearly $64 billion in the first quarter, is expected by the IMF to hit $100 billion by year-end.Moscow has not given up on the forum but the guest list could shrink even further.International Paper CEO John Faraci does not plan to attend, although the company plans to send other executives, a source close to the company said.Kommersant daily newspaper said the chief executives of Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Visa and PepsiCo also may not attend.U.S. energy giant ExxonMobil, a major partner for Rosneft, declined comment. BP, which holds an almost 20 percent stake in Rosneft, also declined to comment on the plans of chief executive Bob Dudley, a regular guest at the forum.Reflecting doubts over the investment climate, Royal Dutch Shell, a shareholder in Russia's sole liquefied natural gas plant feeding Asian markets, has said it is unlikely to be ""jumping into new investments"" in the short term.Telenor CEO Jon Fredrik Baksaas, a shareholder with Russia's  No.3 mobile phone operator Vimpelcom, told Reuters many people were waiting to see how the presidential election in Ukraine goes on May 25.""I think if you started from scratch, it would be hard to see a Western company like Telenor doing a significant investment in Russia right now,"" he said.The chief executives of Telenor, Shell and Norway's Statoil  CEOs were still on the participants list as of May 6. The heads of BP and France Total are also still there.

""We hope that (ExxonMobil) gets the messages and takes action,"" Rysst said. ""All the other operators have taken responsibility and made the necessary changes.""Talks between oil firms and two key unions broke down this month, raising the risk of a strike similar to that in 2012, when a 16-day strike across Norway's oil sector cut production by 13 percent and pushed oil prices above $100 a barrel. The latest dispute would have a much smaller impact initially because the two ExxonMobil fields produced only 46,000 barrels per day (bpd) last year, a relatively small figure for both Norway and the company, but SAFE warned that the industrial action could be widened if necessary.""It's definitely possible to escalate if we don't get a result,"" Rysst said. Unions want ExxonMobil to grant a lower retirement age to 31 workers to bring them into line with other offshore employees, but the company said it would not discuss pensions.""In our opinion and also in the opinion of the Norwegian Oil and Gas Association, this is a matter that doesn't belong in the negotiation or the mediation,"" ExxonMobil spokesman Knut Riple told Reuters.The sides will appear before a state mediator in late May or in June and even if talks break down, leading to a strike, the Norwegian government has the right to impose a deal and force employees to return to work.

86,"  * China's LNG imports rose 35 pct in Q1 to 5.62 mln T* Seen overtaking S.Korea to become second-biggest LNG buyer by 2020* High prices & shale gas development to challenge China LNG demandBy Jacob Gronholt-PedersenSINGAPORE, May 14 China's imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) are growing at a record pace as it aims to use cleaner fuels to cut smog in big cities, creating a powerful new source of demand that has the potential to reshape the market for the super-chilled gas.Rising Chinese demand gives LNG producers such as Chevron , Royal Dutch Shell, ExxonMobil and Total a crucial new sales avenue as they weigh whether to go ahead with $180 billion in investments into potential new or expanded LNG projects.Producers face rising costs in Australia - where many LNG projects are based - and uncertainty about longer-term demand in Japan and South Korea, the world's top two buyers of the fuel.The Chinese, though, are spending billions of dollars in buying LNG-related interests overseas and in building new import terminals. LNG imports are up 35 percent to 5.62 million tonnes in the first quarter against the year-ago period, according to customs data.And imports are set to rise by a third this year, according to research firm Energy Aspects. They grew 25 percent annually over the last four years, Thomson Reuters Point Carbon says. ""Producers are certainly looking at China, because that's the only market right now that will offer 2-3 million tonne deals,"" said Gavin Thompson, head of Asia Pacific gas and power at consultancy Wood Mackenzie.By the end of this decade, China could overtake South Korea to become the world's second-biggest LNG buyer behind Japan.The consultancy forecasts China's imports to rise to 61 million tonnes in 2020 from 18 million tonnes last year, led by supply from Australia. By comparison, South Korea's state-run Korea Gas Corp (KOGAS) expects demand to rise to 45 million tonnes by 2020 from 40 million last year.Japan and South Korea have increased LNG consumption to replace lost nuclear power, but uncertainty remains about the future of idled nuclear plants amid safety and cost concerns. China's state energy companies, meanwhile, are already competing for supply by securing equity stakes in projects across the globe.Malaysian state-owned oil firm Petronas said in April it will sell a 15 percent stake in its $11 billion LNG export terminal on Canada's Pacific Coast to China's Sinopec Group and state-owned power group China Huadian Corp .HURDLES TO DEMAND GROWTH China plans to more than double its natural gas supply capacity to 400 billion cubic meters per year by 2020. Still, uncertainty remains about the pace of growth in a country where energy use is dictated by politics. And consistently high LNG prices in Asia LNG-AS since the Fukushima disaster could hamper demand growth in China, as the country remains more price sensitive than Japan and South Korea.Nevertheless, Asian prices are widely expected to fall as a new wave of Australian supply hits the market in the next 3-4 years, further boosting Chinese demand, industry observers say.China's import needs also depend on how successful it is in developing its own unconventional gas resources. China, believed to hold the world's largest reserves of shale gas, hopes to replicate the U.S. production boom.""Whether or not China develops its own natural gas production can make a huge swing in the global demand,"" said David Carroll, vice president of the International Gas Union.Until now, at least, it seems China's state energy firms have focused mostly on securing gas from projects abroad and shipping it to a string of new LNG imports terminals.Import capacity is slated to rise from the current 31 million tonnes per year at nine terminals to over 80 million tonnes by 2018, when another 15 import terminals either approved or already under construction begin operations.Add to that another 13 terminals that are either planned or proposed and capacity could top 110 million tonnes by the beginning of the next decade. By comparison, Japan last year imported 87 million tonnes of LNG.

87,"  * Exxon works with Rosneft, whose CEO Sechin is on US sanctions list* Putin said Russia could revise participation of West in its economy* Russia needs new technology to develop tight oil, Arctic   (Adds details, quotes, background)By Katya Golubkova and Denis PinchukMOSCOW, May 16 U.S. energy company ExxonMobil  has no plans to pull out of an oil project off Russia's Pacific Sakhalin island, it said on Friday, denying a media report that it could do so due to tensions between Moscow and the West over the crisis in Ukraine.The United States and the EU have imposed sanctions on Moscow and put some Russian officials and businessmen on sanction lists following Russia's annexation of Ukraine's Crimea peninsula in March.Those included Igor Sechin, a close ally of President Vladimir Putin and the head of Russian state oil major Rosneft , which co-owns the Sakhalin-1 project with Exxon.The fate of the partnership is being closely watched after Putin said last month Russia could reconsider the participation of Western companies in its economy, including energy projects.Russian state news agency ITAR TASS quoted a Sakhalin region source as saying Exxon may leave the project and local authorities would buy its stake.""These rumours are groundless. This situation (sanctions) has neither an effect on our activity in Russia, nor on our investment plans in Sakhalin-1. We have no other plans than to go ahead with the project,"" an Exxon official said. Regional authorities declined to comment on Friday.Asked about the TASS report Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said on Friday that he had not received  ""official information"" that Exxon may leave the project.""This needs to be rechecked,"" he said.Rosneft said it was interested in developing ""partnerships"" with all global players but declined further comment. ExxonMobil holds a 30 percent stake in Sakhalin 1, Japan's Sodeco has 30 percent, India's ONGC holds 20 percent and the rest is controlled by Rosneft.Last year, the project produced 7 million tonnes of oil -  140,000 barrels per day.Exxon and Rosneft are also partners in a yet-to-be-built liquefied natural gas plant in Russia's Far East and plan to jointly develop Russian Arctic fields and explore for unconventional oil in Siberia.Russia, the world's largest energy producer, is hoping to repeat the success of the United States in shale oil as output is set to decline from conventional mature fields in West Siberia.""ExxonMobil possibly exiting the project would be a significant negative scenario for Rosneft,"" Alfa Bank said in a note on Friday. ""That could seriously jeopardize Rosneft's partnerships with ExxonMobil in terms of Arctic shelf exploration and tight oil reserves...where Rosneft lacks the experience and technology, and relies heavily on international majors.""SANCTIONS The United States has so far imposed tougher sanctions on Moscow than the European Union, which gets a third of its gas and oil from Russia.Many global CEOs are cancelling their trips to Russia's main economic conference in St Petersburg next week - Russia's answer to the Davos World Economic Forum - after the White House said it would be inappropriate for heads of big U.S. firms to attend this year.Exxon's boss Rex Tillerson has attended several forums in the past but is not featuring on the programme this year.Royal Dutch Shell, which sold part of its stake in Sakhalin-2 project to Gazprom in 2006 after months of pressure, said in April it was unlikely to jump into new investments in Russia in the short term.Energy Minister Novak said on Friday that foreign companies are still interested in working in Russia. ""I know that many companies are contacting their governments to stop these talks about sanctions,"" he said.

88,"   By Matt Siegel  SYDNEY May 21 ExxonMobil's $19 billion liquefied natural gas (LNG) project in Papua New Guinea, which is shipping its first cargo, is set to dramatically transform one of Asia-Pacific's most unstable countries, for better or for worse.The LNG venture, which is expected to produce more than 9 trillion cubic feet of gas over 30 years, is the largest private investment in the South Pacific nation's history.ExxonMobil is relying on projects like this one for much-needed production growth, while the Papua New Guinea government hopes it might double its $15 billion dollar economy, now slightly larger than Botswana's.But sharing the spoils of resource projects has previously torn apart a country that is seen as one of the most corrupt in the world, and with a political system that produced two rival governments claiming to be in charge for much of 2012.And as the first cargo of clean-burning LNG is shipped to Japan, the government has yet to fully identify which landowners will receive royalties, a critical holdup that has raised the spectre of unrest in the impoverished highlands where locals are anxiously awaiting a historic windfall.The big question now is whether the project will prove to be a blessing or a curse, said Bryant Allen, an expert on Papua New Guinea at the Australian National University, who helped Exxon in identifying and compensating affected landowners there.""If the Papua New Guinea government could find a way to get those funds to flow back into the education system and back into the health system and fix up all those schools, this could be fantastic for PNG,"" he said.""But I just don't see it happening at the moment.""Other resource projects in Papua New Guinea have previously stirred violence or even civil conflict, and even when up and running there is a risk of money being squandered or pocketed by officials.A copper mine once operated by Rio Tinto became a central issue in a bloody secessionist conflict in the semi-autonomous Bougainville region, while other projects have been blamed for environmental damage and human rights abuses. DESPITE ALL THE POLITICAL NOISE ExxonMobil's agreement with the government sets aside a 2 percent royalty for landowners, to be held in trust by the government until they have vetted the clans that claim to own the land.Petroleum and Energy Minister Nixon Duban could not be reached for comment by phone or email, but he told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation earlier this month that he hoped most of the clan-vetting would be completed by Christmas.The project contains unprecedented potential upside for Papua New Guinea. Its economy is forecast to hit a record 21 percent growth rate in 2015 on the back of the project, with the government expecting to bank 1.7 billion to 2.2 billion kina ($621 million to $803 million) per year until early next decade. That figure will soar to 4.5 billion kina, boosting total revenue by 40 percent from 2014 before construction of a second $12 billion LNG project, expected to boost the economy further when work begins around 2017 or 2018.ExxonMobil and its partners - Oil Search Ltd, Santos Ltd, Japan's Nippon Oil Corp and the PNG government - are looking to expand the plant, but have yet to decide where to source the additional gas.ExxonMobil PNG Ltd Managing Director Peter Graham said that he has faith that the government would seize on the project's potential to radically transform Papua New Guinea.""I am really proud of what we've contributed throughout four years of construction. We're ahead of schedule - and there aren't many resource projects in the region that can say that.""He said he was confident of the government's ability to distribute funds, adding that a transparent benefit sharing and distribution process was critical for long-term security. RISK OF TROUBLE Not everyone, however, is so sanguine about its prospects.The highland valleys where the project is located are among the most isolated locales on Earth and deciding who is entitled to compensation is a hugely complicated task made more so by competing land claims and complex local concepts of ownership.On top of this Papua New Guinea is ranked 144th out of 177 nations on Transparency International's 2013 Global Corruption Index, putting it just ahead of Zimbabwe.""Right now there's an expectation that wealth will come. My point of view is that if people don't see something within 12 months of the startup, there will be big trouble,"" said Grant Worner, a former CEO of New Guinea Energy, an energy explorer.The use of violence to settle disputes is also woven into the tribal fabric and assault weapons are ubiquitous.The 700 km PNG LNG pipeline is mostly buried underground, though some experts warn of its vulnerability to sabotage.In 2010 villagers attacked the plant site, burning heavy machinery and using high-powered weapons to damage construction equipment over a land dispute, according to a media report, and in March this year at least four people died in inter-tribal fighting in the highlands surrounding the gas fields.""I've seen these guys in the bush and they can move through the bush at an amazing speed, so if they decided to take on their government because they were so cranky about it, it could be quite a nasty little war up there at some stage,"" Allen of the Australian National University said.

89,"  MILAN May 20 ExxonMobil's Papua New Guinea gas liquefaction plant is expected to export around 20 cargoes during the project's start-up phase lasting until September, traders said.The rapid export rate from the new plant, which was completed slightly ahead of schedule, has helped push global LNG prices lower as major Japanese buyers retreat from spot markets.Exxon will sell the bulk of its output to buyers with which it has long-term supply deals, such as Japan's Tokyo Electric Power and Osaka Gas, allowing them to fill needs without resorting to price-sensitive spot purchases. ""It's going to be exporting around four to five cargoes per month over this period, but most of that will go to long-term buyers,"" one trade source said. Traders expect Exxon, however, to offer two to three cargoes on the spot market for July loading as early as this week. Some traders advised against over-optimistic assessments of output given that start-up cargoes are always subject to delays as engineers fine-tune the liquefaction process.

97,"  * Rig has good chance of finding commercial quantities of gas - experts* Drilling platform has been deployed since early May, no results so far* Commercial production could strain Vietnam-China ties for years* Exxon Mobil has found oil and gas in blocks closer to VietnamBy Charlie ZhuHONG KONG, May 29 A Chinese oil rig whose deployment to waters claimed by Vietnam early this month triggered a rupture in ties has a good chance of finding enough gas to put the area into production, Chinese industry experts said.That would give China its first viable energy field in the disputed South China Sea, as well as make it a source of friction with Hanoi for years to come.For now, China has said nothing about the potential of the area. The first round of drilling had been completed, the rig operator said on Tuesday, without giving any results from the tapped wells.The $1 billion deepwater rig owned by state-run China National Offshore Oil Company Group (CNOOC Group), parent of flagship unit CNOOC Ltd, is scheduled to explore until mid-August.""The place where the rig is drilling at the moment is likely to be a gas field. China conducted three-dimensional geological surveys before moving the rig there,"" said Wu Shicun, president of the National Institute for South China Sea Studies, a Chinese government think-tank on the southern island of Hainan.""China is pretty confident ... otherwise they wouldn't start drilling,"" added Wu, a leading expert on China's ambitions in the South China Sea.China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), the dominant oil and gas producer in China, owns the block being drilled but has given it no name, Chinese officials said. The world's largest energy user imports nearly 60 percent of its oil needs and more than 30 percent of its natural gas.EXXON FOUND OIL AND GAS NEARBY  Deployment of the rig on May 2 set off deadly anti-Chinese riots in Vietnam while scores of Vietnamese and Chinese ships remain squared off around the platform. There have been several collisions.The rig lies approximately 330 km (205 miles) east of Vietnam and 370 km from the southern coast of Hainan. It is just below the Paracel island chain occupied by China and claimed by Hanoi. Earlier this week the rig was moved after having been some 20 nautical miles closer to central Vietnam's coast.Hanoi has said the Haiyang Shiyou 981 rig is in its exclusive economic zone. China says its biggest and most advanced mobile energy platform was operating within its waters.In a 2013 report, the U.S. Energy Information Administration, a government agency, said geological evidence suggested the Paracel islands themselves did not have significant potential in terms of conventional hydrocarbons.But near the islands the chance of making a major gas discovery was high because there had been several gas finds already in the area, said James Hubbard, head of Asia oil and gas research at investment bank Macquarie in Hong Kong.""It's not a huge leap of faith to think they might be targeting a gas-prone structure,"" he said.Indeed, Vietnam has two fields to the left of the rig, much closer to its coast, where U.S. giant Exxon Mobil Corp  discovered oil and gas in 2011 and 2012.A part of Vietnam's Blocks 118 and 119 fall within China's so-called nine-dash line, a boundary Beijing uses on its official maps to show its claim to 90 percent of the South China Sea. The controversial line extends deep into the heart of maritime Southeast Asia. Soon after Exxon made its announcement about Block 118 in 2011, China warned foreign energy companies against exploration in disputed areas. It did not name Exxon.No production had taken place in Blocks 118 and 119, Do Van Khanh, head of state-run PetroVietnam Exploration Production Corporation, told Reuters. He declined to discuss the rig.In a statement, Exxon said it was in talks with Vietnamese authorities about the feasibility of developing central Vietnam's natural gas resources. It did not respond to questions about the possible impact from China's exploration nearby.Exxon CEO Rex Tillerson and CNOOC Group Chairman Wang Yilin met in Beijing on May 14, the Chinese company said on its website, adding they discussed ""further cooperation"" between the two energy giants. It gave no specific details.A DECADE OF SURVEYS Neither CNOOC Group nor CNPC could be reached for comment on the rig or the field despite repeated attempts. An executive at China Oilfield Services Ltd , the service arm of CNOOC Group and the rig's operator, declined to give details on drilling results so far.But a Chinese oil industry official with knowledge of the field said a CNPC team which surveyed the block had told him the potential was ""pretty good"" based on data collected over a 10-year period.""But of course we won't know the exact amount of reserves until we drill,"" added the official, who declined to be identified because he was not authorised to discuss the matter with the media. Experts said if the rig found commercial reserves, China would bring in platforms for production and pipe-laying ships to build the infrastructure to transfer gas to vessels. That process could take several years while production could last decades.""The tensions between the two sides will absolutely rise to the top if China finds oil in that area,"" said Duong Danh Dy, a former Vietnamese diplomat.""There will be more collisions, more conflict. I would not exclude armed conflict.""Discoveries near the coasts of Southeast Asian countries in recent years have been mostly natural gas, reinforcing the belief among geologists and explorers that there is more gas than oil in the South China Sea. Natural gas yields much lower returns than oil because gas is generally cheaper but costs much more to produce, store and transport.Some energy production is taking place in the South China Sea, but deepwater areas remain untapped, largely because tensions between rival claimants have made oil companies and private oil service companies reluctant to explore contentious acreage well away from sovereign coastlines.Hanoi, for example, said last week it was considering taking legal action against China following the rig's deployment. The Philippines, another claimant in the South China Sea, challenged China by filing a case with an international arbitration tribunal in late March.Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan also claim parts of the South China Sea, whose estimated energy potential varies widely.NEXT STOP THE SPRATLYS? Some Chinese industry experts said they believed the 981 rig - once called ""mobile national territory"" by CNOOC - would be moved elsewhere in the South China Sea once exploration was completed near the Paracel islands.They said this would eventually include the Spratlys, an archipelago south of the Paracels where military fortifications belonging to China, Vietnam, Taiwan, the Philippines and Malaysia dot the waterways.""The rig was designed, meant for oil exploration in the South China Sea,"" said Lin Boqiang, director of the China Center for Energy Economics Research at Xiamen University and an adviser to China's National Energy Administration, the top regulator of China's energy industry.""It will move into deep waters in other parts of the South China Sea.""Wu, from the South China Sea Studies institute, said Beijing was sending a clear signal to the international community that it was capable of carrying out deepwater development.""China should have done this a long time ago but it did not have the tools and technology. It also lacked the capability to safeguard its offshore operations,"" he said.

98,"  (Adds meeting votes)By Anna DriverDALLAS May 28Exxon Mobil Corp's  drilling operations in Russia and its partnership with Russian oil company Rosneft have so far not been disrupted by tensions between Russia and Ukraine or sanctions imposed by the United States, Exxon's CEO said on Wednesday.""We're extremely proud of what we've been able to accomplish in Russia,"" Exxon Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson told shareholders. ""They've been very good partners for us.""He added that Exxon does not ""generally"" support sanctions and has made that view known to the U.S. government, which has imposed economic penalties on several individuals, including Rosneft chief Igor Sechin.Rosneft was not named in the sanctions, which were imposed after the West complained that Russia was meddling in the affairs of Ukraine.""We're having conversations such that our views are being heard at the highest levels,"" Tillerson told reporters after the company's annual meeting, declining to elaborate. The U.S. penalties have so far not affected Exxon's relationship with Rosneft and the U.S. company has been able to hold meetings with Sechin in Russia and Europe, Tillerson said.While some Western oil companies have left Russia in recent years because of a difficult business climate, U.S. companies Exxon Mobil and Chevron Corp, along with British major BP, have significant ties there.Exxon has operated in Russia for more than 20 years, Tillerson said. In Russia, Exxon Mobil's net holdings in Sakhalin at the end of 2013 totaled 85,000 acres, all offshore, and its net holdings in Rosneft joint-venture agreements for the Kara and Black seas were 11.3 million acres.The two companies also have a joint venture to evaluate the development of tight-oil reserves in western Siberia.Only last week, Rosneft and Exxon signed a deal to continue work on the Far East LNG (liquefied natural gas) project, which will be fed from the companies' Sakhalin wells. Exxon's shareholders meeting drew more than a dozen protesters who painted the corporation as being irresponsible on issues such as climate change. One carried a sign that read ""Billionaires for Big Energy"".""It cannot be business as usual,"" Gary Stuard, an environmental activist, told a news conference ahead of the meeting.Tillerson characterized the debate over climate change as very complex and said his company takes the issue seriously but he said that it will be impossible to reduce emissions to the levels that some are targeting.""There is not going to be a ready set of solutions,"" he said.The Irving, Texas, company's shareholders voted down proposals to report on its lobbying and limit the number of directorships its directors may hold. But more investors than last year supported the company's compensation plan for executives after Exxon cut bonus pay.In an advisory vote, about 90 percent of Exxon's shareholders voted for the company's pay plan for executives, up from 70 percent last year.

After delays and cost overruns, production at Kashagan - one of the world's biggest finds of the past decades - finally started last September but was halted in early October after the discovery of gas leaks in the pipeline network.Oil output may not restart until early 2016, Kazakh officials said in May, urging foreign partners to start replacing leaky pipelines at the deposit.Italy's Eni was given the job of operating the project in 2001. It later lost its role as the sole lead operator following major delays and cost overruns. The Kashagan shareholders are Eni, Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch Shell, France's Total and Kazakh state oil company Kazmunaigas, each with 16.8 percent, and Japan's Inpex and China National Petroleum Corp. (CNPC) as junior partners.The seven firms will continue to oversee the managing director. But under the new scheme, the reformed joint venture, run by the managing director, will be responsible for drilling,  development and production at the same time, whilst in the past those responsibilities were split in a complicated way between Eni, Kazmunaigas, Shell and Exxon.No changes to the production sharing agreement or the project's ownership structure are envisioned as a result of the planned transition, the venture said in a statement.Working ""under one umbrella"" means that workflows will be more efficient, Wenck said.The field was meant to be producing 370,000 barrels per day at the peak of the first phase which is likely to be achieved only a few years after the field restart.

107,"  (Adds details, Exxon quotes, context)MOSCOW, June 16 Exxon Mobil's Chief Executive Rex Tillerson affirmed his commitment to doing business with Russia on Monday with a speech at a high-profile industry conference in Moscow.Western governments have urged global firms to avoid such appearances as they impose sanctions on Russian business leaders over Russia's annexation of Crimea and its actions in eastern Ukraine, where pro-Russian armed rebels are seeking secession.In May, several Western energy bosses attended the St Petersburg International Economic Forum, saving it from failure as top executives from banks and other firms stayed away. ""In the years ahead, we look forward to tapping advantages ... in the Far East of Russia..., unlocking new supplies of oil and natural gas in the Kara Sea and beyond,"" Tillerson told the World Petroleum Congress in Moscow.BP CEO Bob Dudley, who attended the St Petersburg forum, told reporters on the sidelines of the Moscow congress that BP ""continues to work and do business as usual"" in Russia.

108,"  OSLO, June 17 Mediation between Norwegian offshore oil workers and the industry began on Tuesday in an attempt to avert a strike at GDF Suez and ExxonMobil  platforms, the Norwegian Oil and Gas Association said.The unions have said they will initially put 230 oil workers on strike, cutting Norway's oil output by an estimated 100,000 barrels of oil per day, or about 7 percent of total capacity, if the mandatory talks at the state mediator's office fail.The deadline for the talks is midnight on Tuesday (2200 GMT), although that may be extended by a few hours if the parties agree to do so.Norwegian oil output averaged 1.5 million barrels per day in the first five months of 2014, according to data from the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate.The talks cover some 3,500 offshore oil workers, and are centred on unions' demands regarding pension rights.The Norwegian Organisation of Managers and Executives (Lederne) said it planned to put 76 workers on strike on the GDF Suez-operated Gjoea platform, if the talks fail. That could also affect output from the Statoil-operated  Vega field, tied to facilities at Gjoea.The Norwegian Union of Energy Workers (Safe) has said it planned to put 154 workers on strike, affecting production from ExxonMobil's Jotun, Ringhorne and Balder fields.A reduction of Norwegian oil output could add to global oil supply concerns already fuelled by the situation in Iraq. In 2012, 10 percent of Norway's offshore workers went on strike for 16 days, cutting oil output by 13 percent and gas production by 4 percent, and helping to push oil prices to over $100 a barrel at that time.While the scope of this year's strike could be smaller, because negotiations exclude the biggest union Industri Energi, it could still add to supply concerns. The strike could cut Norwegian natural gas output by some 15 million cubic metres per day compared with the current total production of 240 mcm/day, but due to low summer demand production has been well below its full capacity of 350 mcm/day.The government can stop the strike and impose a settlement if it is deemed to be a threat to Norway's economic interests. It did so in 2012 after oil firms threatened a full lockout.The petroleum sector contributes to more than a fifth of total gross domestic product (GDP) in the world's seventh-biggest oil exporter and Western Europe's top gas supplier.Further mediation between the unions representing workers at onshore supply bases is expected to take place on June 19-20, the oil industry said.(Reporting by Nerijus Adomaitis, editing by Terje Solsvik and David Evans)",2014-06-17,XOM,"Tue Jun 17, 2014 | 6:58am EDT","Norway unions, industry in talks to avert oil strike",http://www.reuters.com//article/norway-oil-strike-idUSL5N0OY2OW20140617?type=companyNews

113,"  June 19 Exxon Mobil Corp said on Thursday it has started construction on a new chemical plant in Baytown, Texas, and begun expanding a nearby plant, part of a plan to use shale-derived natural gas to make plastics and other material.The Baytown plant, known within the industry as a cracker, will be able to produce 1.5 million tonnes of ethylene per year.Exxon, the largest U.S. producer of natural gas, is simultaneously expanding a Mont Belvieu plant to be able to process the ethylene into polyethylene. Polyethylene, a basic plastic, is used to make bags, bottles and other common consumer goods. A company spokeswoman declined to provide the precise cost of the multi-billion dollar project, describing it as proprietary information.Exxon estimates the Houston-area projects will require about 10,000 workers to construct and create 4,000 jobs in the local economy.

Turkish officials say talks have since advanced and are likely to result in an agreement.""ExxonMobil is coming to Turkey to partner up with TPAO,"" Selami Incedalci, the head of the energy ministry's General Directorate of Petroleum Affairs, said late on Sunday.

Investors from the United States, Europe and Canada are also interested in Turkey's shale gas and oil, Incedalci said, adding that the Ministry was planning to hold talks with potential investors in October.Royal Dutch Shell is also drilling for shale gas in the region around the southeastern city of Diyarbakir, while Canadian firm TransAtlantic Petroleum is also active in the region. Estimates of how big Turkey's shale gas reserves are vary wildly.One energy official said data from some international bodies suggested Turkey could have a massive 20 trillion cubic metres (cbm) of total reserves. Another industry expert said proven reserves so far stood at just 6-7 billion cbm.That compares with U.S. Energy Intelligence Administration's (EIA) assessment of 7,299 trillion cubic feet of estimated shale gas reserves in the United States, among the world's top producers of the commodity.(Reporting by Orhan Coskun, Writing by Humeyra Pamuk; Editing by Nick Tattersall and Louise Heavens)",2014-06-23,XOM,"Mon Jun 23, 2014 | 7:11am EDT",UPDATE 1-ExxonMobil in talks with Turkey over shale gas exploration,http://www.reuters.com//article/exxon-mobil-turkey-idUSL6N0P425520140623?type=companyNews

116,"  * Moscow dependent on high-tech equipment, foreign know-how* Some sanctions already in place, create uncertainty* Western service companies crucial providers of modern technologyBy Katya Golubkova and Dmitry ZhdannikovMOSCOW/LONDON, July 9 With President Vladimir Putin watching from afar, the head of Rosneft, Igor Sechin, launched the world's biggest oil drilling platform in the Okhotsk Sea to warm handshakes with his colleagues from ExxonMobil.Beamed live to the Kremlin on June 27, the event marked a major step in fulfilling the president's goal of increasing oil output, and the presence of U.S. executives seemed to support Putin's argument that Western sanctions were not hurting.But partly built in South Korea, the more than 200,000 tonne Berkut platform at the Sakhalin-1 project, led by Exxon, also highlighted the oil industry's dependence on foreign technology - something Washington could target if it decides to step up sanctions on Russia over its actions in Ukraine.It also underlines the difficulty for the Russian industry, despite years of attempts, to build its own services sector at a time the country needs to tap unconventional and Arctic reserves to compensate for the output drop from mature Siberian fields.""Russian producers can't compete in this sector with foreigners mostly because of a complete lack of similar (high-tech) goods,"" said Viktor Khaikov, vice-president of the Yugra Association of Oil and Gas Service Companies based in Russia's largest oil producing region in western Siberia.Russia will be overtaken by the United States as the world's largest oil producer this year after a decade of global leadership and it will take years before it will be able to ramp up output from its shale formations or the Arctic. The Berkut platform will add only 90,000 barrels per day within three years to Russia's total output, currently standing at around 10.5 million bpd. Russia hopes to produce over 1 million bpd from shale and offshore sites in the medium term.In May, Energy Minister Alexander Novak asked Putin to boost funding of domestic equipment producers saying that a quarter of all equipment used in oil output enhancement was imported and naming catalysts, refining equipment and gas turbine parts as the areas where Russia was most dependent on the West.The remarks came just as the industry scrambled to assess the impact from sanctions that Washington could potentially impose on high-tech equipment exports into Russia should Moscow fail to help reduce tensions in eastern Ukraine.VAGUE RESTRICTIONS  Some sanctions have been already put in place from April when the U.S. Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) announced that it would deny pending applications for licenses to export or re-export any high tech items that contribute to Russia's military capabilities.Wynn Segall, partner at Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld LLP in Washington, who specialises in international trade and sanctions, said the wording of these restrictions was vague.For most Western companies, and especially American, that means refraining from doing business or slowing it while seeking maximum clarification.Domestic companies dominate Russia's oilfields services market by revenue, according to privately-owned service firm Integra. Eurasia Drilling Company (EDC) has 15 percent of the market, followed by Surgutneftegas and Gazprom with 10 percent. Schlumberger, the world's No. 1 oilfield services company by revenue has 9 percent, while Halliburton and Baker Hughes account for 1 percent each of a market estimated to be worth $18 billion in 2013. According to Integra, it will grow to almost $26 billion in 2017.Halliburton, Schlumberger and Baker Hughes all declined to comment on the impact of Russian sanctions. Halliburton said it would comply fully with all laws and trade restrictions and Schlumberger said the Russian market was highly competitive.In its 2013 report, Schlumberger said Russia and central Asia were the key drivers behind an 8 percent growth in revenues of its Europe, CIS and Africa division to $12.4 billion, a third of its total revenues of $45.3 billion.Some companies such as Gazprom Neft say they have almost fully switched to local suppliers, spending 95 percent of its purchasing budget at home.In May, Gazprom Neft signed agreements with Russia's United Heavy Machinery Plants, which produces drilling rigs and refining equipment, and Hydromashservice, a pump producer, for equipment for its onshore, offshore and refining operations.Rosneft, which is developing its own oil service unit RN-Burenie, recently agreed with Gazprom, Novatek, Gazprombank and other firms to team up to build ships, drilling platforms and marine equipment.Alexander Korsik, who heads Bashneft, Russia's fastest growing oil company by output, said sanctions on foreign equipment might push Russia closer to China.""China will simply be seen as more reliable,"" he said.In May, Russia signed a $400 billion gas deal with China, but Moscow has so far been reluctant to allow China to develop its oil fields on a large scale.

117,"   By Steve Quinn | JUNEAU, Alaska, July 21  JUNEAU, Alaska, July 21 Exxon Mobil Corp , its partners and the state of Alaska are seeking federal permission to export liquefied natural gas (LNG) from a multibillion-dollar project that includes an 800-mile pipeline cutting across the state from Alaska's North Slope, the group said on Monday.The development is part of a series of recent steps taken to eventually market 35 trillion cubic feet of North Slope reserves with project costs ranging from $45 billion to $65 billion.The moves follow a decades-long effort that had stalled, either from drastic global market changes, such as the infusion of shale natural gas throughout the Lower 48, or political logjams.""Filing of an export application is a critical step in commercializing North Slope natural gas,"" Steve Butt, an Exxon Mobil employee who serves as the senior project manager, said in a statement. The group, made up of North Slope leaseholders Exxon, ConocoPhillips, BP Plc , pipeline company TransCanada Corp and the state, earlier this month signed a joint venture agreement to begin investing millions into preliminary engineering work for the next 18 months.In April, the state's Legislature solidly backed Governor Sean Parnell's plan to work with the industry on a project development contract. The group filed the permit with the U.S. Department of Energy late on Friday, asking permission to export 20 million metric tons of LNG annually to existing free trade and non free-trade countries.Most of the public discussion has called for the gas to tap in to Asia's rising demand for LNG and be available in the mid-2020s, according to state projections. The permit seeks approval for 30 years of exports dating from when the gas is first shipped or 12 years from when permission is granted, whichever comes first.The 212-page application calls the development the ""largest integrated gas/LNG project of its kind ever designed and constructed.""In addition to the 42-inch diameter, 800 mile-long line from the North Slope to an LNG plant and terminal in Cook Inlet, the project would feature a North Slope gas treatment plant, a 58-mile line from the Point Thomson gas field to the east of Prudhoe Bay.""Alaska's LNG Project is on the right track with hundreds of Alaskans out in the field this summer working to secure permits and hundreds more working to refine the engineering and design challenges of the project,"" Parnell said.

118,"  * U.S. sanctions on Russia include Rosneft, Exxon's partner* Project may not break sanctions but brings political risks   (Recasts, adds background)By Balazs Koranyi and Gwladys FoucheOSLO, July 21 An ordinary, long-scheduled journey of an oil drilling rig into Arctic waters is turning into a major political exercise, attracting international scrutiny and creating a dilemma for Exxon Mobil Corp.Exxon, the top U.S. oil major and the world's most valued oil company, is bringing the rig, called West Alpha, from Norway to the Russian Arctic. It is hoping for a major discovery in the Kara Sea with Russian partner Rosneft Oil Co.The journey has begun just as the United States has slapped the toughest sanctions yet on Russia, including on Rosneft, over escalating violence in Ukraine. Further sanctions are likely after the downing of a Malaysia Airlines' plane in eastern Ukraine.The joint activity does not necessarily break the latest sanctions, but the rig's mission could be seen a sign that a top U.S. company is backing Moscow.Arctic exploration costs can exceed hundreds of millions of dollars. The Exxon-Rosneft drilling campaign, therefore, will also show how effective the latest sanctions prove to be in prohibiting U.S. firms from providing new long-term debt or equity to Rosneft.""It's a bit discordant with the message that the United States government is trying to send, having this long-planned summer drilling season go ahead right now,"" said Elizabeth Rosenberg, energy program director at the Center for a New American Security think-tank and a former sanctions adviser at the Treasury Department.From a broader perspective, the project will indicate the resolve of major oil companies to continue dealing with Russia even as conflict escalates with the West. ""We are evaluating the impact of the sanctions and don't have anything further at this time,"" Exxon said in emailed comments.For the Kremlin, the project will become a balancing act between achieving its goals of raising oil output and government revenue and the risk of pushing foreign partners so hard that they run up against the sanctions regime.West Alpha belongs to Norway-listed Seadrill, the world's biggest offshore rig firm, and Exxon has contracted the rig until the third quarter of 2016.Seadrill Chief Financial Officer Rune Magnus Lundetrae told Reuters the rig had already sailed from the Norwegian yard and was on its way to the Kara Sea.""She's on her way up now from the yard where she's been preparing for that activity ... Drilling will start within the third quarter. We're in early Q3 now, so we're talking about this quarter,"" he said. Lundetrae declined to discuss the latest U.S. sanctions: ""We are preparing to drill and will deal with situations as they occur.""Satellite tracking showed the rig was heading towards Russia along the Norwegian coast.SPILLOVER EFFECTS  The latest U.S. sanctions do not necessarily aim to hit projects between Rosneft and foreign partners.President Barack Obama said the sanctions were ""designed to have maximum impact on Russia while limiting any spillover effects on American companies or those who are allies.""But Obama also warned that additional steps were on the table if Russia does not change course in eastern Ukraine - a signal that joint ventures with U.S. companies could face risks.Exxon has shown in the past it can take decisions that do not fully align with U.S. policies.In one recent example, Exxon's decided to invest in Iraq's semi-autonomous Kurdistan region two years ago despite anger from the central government in Baghdad and opposition from Washington.Still, observers should not look at the long-planned Exxon Arctic project as an indication that companies are not wary about the sanctions, or that they will not have an effect, said Rosenberg.""You'd be missing the point if you took one drilling season, what is ultimately at this point a pretty limited joint venture activity, and weighed it quite heavily against the president of the United States,"" she said.The West Alpha journey also will be watched by environmentalists, who call for a ban on offshore drilling in the Arctic. Earlier this year, Greenpeace climbers scaled the West Alpha rig.Truls Gulowsen, head of Greenpeace Norway, could not say whether Greenpeace was planning another protest.

119,"  * Exxon, Petronas and Ophir among the firms chosen* Gabon hopes to reverse chronic oil decline* Tough negotiations have lasted nine months   (Adds details on contract negotiations, context)By Emma FargeDAKAR, July 21 Gabon has selected seven companies for a final round of negotiations as part of an offshore licensing round the government hopes will reverse a chronic decline in output, the country's oil ministry said on Monday.The new blocks are located in deep offshore waters - an exploration play that is expensive and uncertain but potentially very rewarding given the similarity of geological structures to oil-rich Brazil, where billions of barrels of oil have been discovered.Former OPEC member Gabon produces about 230,000 barrels per day (bpd), down from a peak of close to 400,000 bpd in the 1990s.An oil ministry statement said that Impact Oil & Gas, Repsol , Perenco, ExxonMobil, Marathon, Petronas and Ophir were ranked highest for the nine blocks due to be allocated. ""These companies listed are invited to finalise negotiations for the signature of the relevant CEPPs (exploration and production-sharing contracts) as soon as possible,"" according to a statement signed by Minister for Oil and Hydrocarbons Etienne Dieudonne Ngoubou.The statement showed that Cobalt, Noble, Royal Dutch Shell and Total were ranked lower down the pecking order for the blocks. The ministry said it had the right to open negotiations with the lower-ranking contenders if talks with the first-choice companies were unsuccessful.Bids for another eight blocks offered ""did not reach the expectations of the Gabonese Republic"", the statement added.A spokesman for Total, one of the largest producers in the former French colony, said it planned to enter talks with the government for one of these blocks, named F15. TOUGH NEGOTIATIONS The deals end nearly nine months of arduous negotiations involving multiple contract revisions, with some prospective investors complaining privately of tough terms. ""It is a very aggressive production-sharing contract. Some of the terms were trending towards a lack of certainty over assets,"" said a source involved in the negotiations.The ministry said that it had ranked companies based on a range of criteria including social and environmental responsibility as well as companies' capacity to help to fight piracy and to involve Gabonese companies.Another source familiar with the talks said that the high number of companies involved in negotiations showed the appeal of Gabon for explorers, despite high-profile disputes with Total and Sinopec's Addax.""It's not an easy place to do business, but they are still attracting quite a few companies,"" the source said.One of the contested points during negotiations has been the participation of the Gabon Oil Company, created in 2011, sources familiar with the talks said.During exploration, the Gabon Oil Company has the right to acquire a 15 percent stake at market price, according to a draft contract seen by Reuters.The state has a right to a 20 percent stake from the start of oil output and must contribute to production costs, the same contract showed. It was not clear if these articles had been subsequently revised during negotiations.

120,"   By John Wasik | CHICAGO  CHICAGO All too often, I see investors heading in the wrong direction en masse. They buy stocks at the top of the market or bonds when interest rates are heading up.Occasionally, though, active investors may be heading in the right direction. A case in point has been the flow of money into certain exchange-traded funds in the first half of this year.Reflecting most hot money trends, billions of dollars moved because of headlines. The Energy Select SPDR exchange-traded fund, which I discussed three weeks ago, gathered more than $3 billion in assets in the first half, when crude oil prices climbed and demand for hydrocarbons remained high.The Energy SPDR, which charges 0.16 percent for annual management expenses and holds Exxon Mobil Corp, Chevron Corp and Schlumberger NV, has climbed 22 percent in the past 12 months, with nearly one-third of that gain coming in the three months through July 18. Long-term, this may be a solid holding as developing countries such as China and India demand more oil.""We think the Energy Select SPDR is a play of oil prices remaining high and supporting growth for integrated oil & gas and exploration and production companies,"" analysts from S&P Capital IQ said in a recent ""MarketScope Advisor"" newsletter.Headlines also favored European stocks as represented by the Vanguard FTSE Developed Markets ETF, which holds leading eurozone stocks such as Nestle SA, Novartis AG and Roche Holding AG. The fund has been the top asset gatherer thus far this year, with $4 billion in new money, according to S&P Capital IQ.As Europe continues to recover over the next few years and the European Central Bank keeps rates low, global investors will continue to benefit from this growing optimism.The Vanguard fund has gained nearly 16 percent for the 12 months through July 18. It charges 0.09 percent in annual expenses and is a solid holding if you have little or no European exposure in your stock portfolio. RATE HIKES Not all hot money trends make sense, however. As the economy accelerates and interest-rate hikes look increasingly likely, investors are still piling money into bond funds, which lose money under those circumstances.The iShares 7-10 Year Treasury Bond ETF, which holds middle-maturity U.S. Treasury bonds, continued to rank in the top 10 funds in terms of new money in the first half. The fund, which holds nearly $5 billion, is up nearly 4 percent for the 12 months through July 18, compared with 4.2 percent for the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Total return index, a benchmark for U.S. Treasuries. The fund charges 0.15 percent in annual expenses.While investors were able to squeeze a bit more out of bond returns in the first half of this year, they may be living on borrowed time.The U.S. Federal Reserve confirmed recently that it would be ending purchases of U.S. Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities in October. This stimulus program, known as ""QE2,"" has kept interest rates artificially low as the economy has had a chance to recover.  The phasing out of QE2 could be bearish for bond funds.Will interest rates climb to reflect growing demand for credit and possibly higher inflation down the road? How will the ending of the Fed's cheap money program affect U.S. and emerging markets shares? Many pundits believe public corporations may pull back from their enthusiastic stock buybacks and trigger a correction. Yet low inflation and modest employment gains may mute bond market fears.""The Fed is on track to complete tapering in the fourth quarter, and we think there is essentially no chance that it will move the fed funds rate higher this year,"" Bob Doll, chief equity strategist with Nuveen Investments in Chicago, said in a recent newsletter. ""With the 10-year Treasury ending the quarter at 2.5 percent, the yield portion of this forecast is more uncertain,"" Doll added, ""although we expect yields will end the year higher than where they began."" While there could be any number of wild cards spoiling the party for stocks, it is wise to ignore short-term trends and prepare for the eventual climb in interest rates. That means staying away from bond funds with long average maturities along with vehicles like preferred stocks and high-yield bonds that are highly sensitive to interest rates.Longer-term, shares of companies in consumer discretionary, materials and information technology businesses likely to benefit from a global economic resurgence will probably be a good bet.

124,"  * Exxon pulls out staff, decides not to bid, sources say* Chinese, Korean and Japanese firms vying for a stake* Onshore fields produce over half of UAE oil* UAE leaders consider whether to let in Asian firmsBy Rania El Gamal and Stanley CarvalhoABU DHABI, July 21 Asian and western firms have bid to help operate the UAE's biggest oilfields after a deal with oil majors expired this year but the Gulf Arab state is yet to decide whether to let Asian oil buyers in for the long haul, sources said.A final decision on the winning firms is unlikely before early 2015 as political leaders in Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates, weigh whether to bring in Asian firms or stick with old partners, industry and diplomatic sources said.At least one oil major, ExxonMobil, appears to have decided against bidding, the sources told Reuters.ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch Shell, Total and BP - have each held 9.5 percent equity stakes in the Abu Dhabi Company for Onshore Oil Operations (ADCO) concession since the 1970s. Portugal's Partex had a 2 percent stake, and the rest was held by state run Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC).After the deal expired in January, ADNOC took 100 percent of the concession. Shell, Total and BP have made their new bids, which are being evaluated by Abu Dhabi, the sources said.Exxon, however, did not bid for the ADCO concession after it renegotiated a better deal for the Upper Zakum offshore oilfield, which it has been operating with ADNOC and Japan's Inpex since 2006, two sources said. The U.S. major pulled out its staff from the ADCO fields earlier this year, a sign that it has dropped out of the race, sources say.""Exxon has pulled its folks out while others kept their people. (It is) 95-percent (sure) Exxon has decided not to bid,"" one source told Reuters.""They are going to make what? $2 or $3 dollars a barrel? So they probably said: 'why have two projects in the UAE?',"" the source said.Exxon said its ADCO concession expired on Jan.10 but declined to comment about its staff and future plans.Exxon's exit may improve the chances for the other three former partners and pave the way for newcomers to join in. U.S. firm Occidental Petroleum Corp, Italy's ENI , China National Petroleum Corp. (CNPC), Norway's Statoil, Japan's Inpex and Korea National Oil Corp have bid for the new deal, three sources told Reuters.Rosneft has been invited to bid, but it was not clear whether Russia's top oil company has submitted an offer, two industry sources said.""Abu Dhabi's new partners are expected to be selected in early 2015. The evaluation process is underway,"" one industry source said.The onshore fields produce 1.6 million barrels per day (bpd), over half UAE's oil output.The UAE oil minister said in January Abu Dhabi has received strong interest from international firms to participate in the ADCO fields with revised terms. ADNOC did not respond to Reuters emails and calls for  comment. A CNPC official said the Chinese company has bid to operate the ADCO fields, but he knew no further details.None of the remaining companies vying to be part of the next phase of development would comment on the situation.POLITICAL TIES Western oil majors have partnered Abu Dhabi for decades but several Asian energy companies are keen to secure stakes in fields that supply the growing Asian market.That would offer a chance for UAE to strengthen political ties with its biggest oil buyers such as China, South Korea and Japan.""The (UAE) leadership is turning eastwards more than before,"" said Valérie Marcel of think tank Chatham House.""We also know that the leadership wants new types of contracts, which encourage oil companies to invest more of their technology. These forces push Abu Dhabi towards new partners and new terms.""Industry observers say any changes in the concessions would be made at the highest decision-making body for the oil and gas industry, the Supreme Petroleum Council. They say there is a difference in opinion inside the SPC over whether to stick with western companies, or make room for newcomers from Asia, while some would like to see ADNOC operating the fields alone.""At the end of the day it will be the political decision of the leadership in Abu Dhabi on which company will take what,"" a diplomatic source said.

125,"  * U.S. sanctions on Russia include Rosneft, Exxon's partner* Project may not break sanctions but brings political risksBy Balazs Koranyi and Gwladys FoucheOSLO, July 21 An ordinary, long-scheduled journey of an oil drilling rig into Arctic waters is turning into a major political exercise, attracting international scrutiny and creating a dilemma for ExxonMobil.Exxon, the top U.S. oil major and the world's most valued oil company, is bringing the rig, called West Alpha, from Norway to the Russian Arctic. It is hoping for a major discovery in the Kara Sea with Russian partner Rosneft.The journey has begun just as the United States has slapped the toughest sanctions yet on Russia, including on Rosneft, over escalating violence in Ukraine. Further sanctions are likely after the downing of a Malaysia Airlines' plane in eastern Ukraine.The joint activity does not necessarily break the latest sanctions, but the rig's mission will be seen a sign that a top U.S. company is backing Moscow.Arctic exploration costs can exceed hundreds of millions of dollars. The Exxon-Rosneft drilling campaign, therefore, will also show how effective the latest sanctions prove to be in prohibiting U.S. firms from providing new long-term debt or equity to Rosneft.""It's a bit discordant with the message that the United States government is trying to send, having this long-planned summer drilling season go ahead right now,"" said Elizabeth Rosenberg, energy program director at the Center for a New American Security think-tank and a former sanctions adviser at the Treasury Department.From a broader prospective, the project will indicate the resolve of major oil companies to continue dealing with Russia even as conflict escalates with the West. ""We are evaluating the impact of the sanctions and don't have anything further at this time,"" Exxon said in emailed comments.For the Kremlin, the project will become a balancing act between achieving its goals of raising oil output and government revenue and the risk of pushing foreign partners so hard that they run up against the sanctions regime.West Alpha belongs to Norway-listed Seadrill, the world's biggest offshore rig firm, and Exxon has contracted the rig until the third quarter of 2016.Seadrill Chief Financial Officer Rune Magnus Lundetrae told Reuters the rig had already sailed from the Norwegian yard and was on its way to the Kara Sea.""She's on her way up now from the yard where she's been preparing for that activity ... Drilling will start within the third quarter. We're in early Q3 now, so we're talking about this quarter,"" he said. Lundetrae declined to discuss the latest U.S. sanctions: ""We are preparing to drill and will deal with situations as they occur.""Satellite tracking showed the rig was heading towards Russia along the Norwegian coast.SPILLOVER EFFECTS  The latest U.S. sanctions do not necessarily aim to hit projects between Rosneft and foreign partners.President Barack Obama said the sanctions were ""designed to have maximum impact on Russia while limiting any spillover effects on American companies or those who are allies"".But Obama also warned that additional steps were on the table if Russia does not change course in eastern Ukraine - a signal that joint ventures with U.S. companies could face risks.By going ahead with drilling, companies risk antagonising the U.S. administration, Rosenberg said.""You'd be missing the point if you took one drilling season, what is ultimately at this point a pretty limited joint venture activity, and weighed it quite heavily against the president of the United States.""Exxon has shown in the past it can take decisions that do not fully align with U.S. policies.In one recent example, Exxon's decided to invest in Iraq's semi-autonomous Kurdistan region two years ago despite, anger from the central government in Baghdad and opposition from Washington.The West Alpha journey also will be watched by the ecologists, who call for a ban on offshore drilling in the Arctic. Earlier this year, Greenpeace climbers scaled the West Alpha rig.Truls Gulowsen, head of Greenpeace Norway, could not say whether Greenpeace was planning another protest.

126,"  VIENNA, July 21 ExxonMobil and OMV Petrom  announced the start of drilling at a well that will help it assess the size and commercial viability of its Domino 1 Black Sea well, the most significant gas discovery in the region to date.The two companies said on Monday they had started drilling at the Domino 2 well in the deepwater sector of the Neptun block in Romanian waters, which is about 200 kilometres (124 miles) offshore and is being drilled in a depth of about 800 metres. Southeast Europe hopes natural gas exploration in the Black Sea will help cut its dependence on Russian supplies, but a gas bonanza remains elusive because deep water and tough geology have required costly high-tech equipment.  ExxonMobil Exploration and OMV Petrom each hold 50 percent of the deepwater sector of the Neptun block.

127,"   By Simon Falush | LONDON  LONDON ExxonMobil is pouring $1 billion into modernising a European refinery just as others are fleeing the sector, making life even more difficult for older plants struggling to stay afloat.Exxon (XOM.N) said it would install a new coking unit at the 300,000 barrel per day (bpd) Antwerp plant to turn high sulphur oils created as a by-product of the refining process into various types of higher-profit diesel, including shipping fuels that will meet new environmental laws. ""This project demonstrates ExxonMobil's long-term view,"" said Remko Kruithof, Exxon's public and government affairs manager for the region. ""It is the first of several (investments) we are evaluating to further strengthen our strategic refineries in Europe to more successfully face the challenging industry environment."" Exxon is considering refinery investments in the United States, where plants there run close to full capacity, but it is the sums in Europe that have surprised some observers as where market conditions are far more challenging.Analysts said Exxon's reasoning for making this move now are particular to its own refining economics, with the plant able to process heavy fuels that its other refineries in the region such as Fawley in England, are not able to deal with.Exxon is also swimming against the tide in Europe.Although France's Total (TOTF.PA), Europe's biggest refiner, promised in 2010 not to close any plants in its domestic market for five years after it shut the Dunkirk refinery, union sources and analysts think Total could shut plants next year, after the promised period expires. Exxon's move spells more pain for competitors in the region that will have to compete with a plant that is more efficient and better equipped to deal with current European fuel needs.   ""It will enable it to have higher utilisation rates, which would mean lower rates at other plants,"" said Alan Gelder, senior vice president at Wood Mackenzie.""It could challenge smaller refineries and accelerate the process of forcing closures.""BP (BP.L) and Shell (RDSa.L) have already sold plants to smaller independent players, which in some cases subsequently closed them, while others are struggling to keep them operating. REFINERS IN TROUBLE The feeble state of the refining industry in Europe was highlighted by the latest data from Euroilstock, which showed that European refineries processed 11 percent less crude oil in June from a year earlier, as weak profits forced plants to cut back.In Italy, Eni (ENI.MI) is threatened with a credit downgrade if it fails to turn around its refining business while being hit by strikes next week to prevent closures.Other European refiners are also in trouble. Czech Unipetrol (UNPE.PR) took an unexpected 4.72 billion crown ($231.5 million) impairment charge on its refining assets in the second quarter, pushing its results into the red.  Poland's refiner PKN Orlen (PKN.WA) wants to sell its Orlen Lietuva unit, but its chief executive said it would be ""hard to imagine"" to find a buyer. ""Northwest Europe specifically is high on our consolidation pressure list, as the steadily growing outflows from Russia are hitting primarily this region,"" said David Wech, analyst at JBC energy in Vienna, adding that some 500,000 bpd of diesel from Russia would hit the region by 2016.  When plants do close, analysts say it will benefit those like Exxon's which have invested in modern refineries.""There will be closures as utilisation rates have come down, but those with complex integrated systems like Exxon's Antwerp plant can benefit from closures elsewhere,"" said Blake Fernandez, senior analyst at Howard Weil brokers in New Orleans. Around 2 million bpd or roughly 15 percent of Europe's refining capacity will need to be shut by 2018 in order to balance the market, according to consultancy JBC Energy.The pressure is a result of competition from the Middle East and Russia, where refineries are more efficient, and because European oil demand is falling due to rising energy efficiency.

128,"   By Erwin Seba | HOUSTON  HOUSTON Exxon Mobil Corp is considering a multibillion-dollar  plan to expand its Beaumont, Texas, refinery into the country's largest, the first major refining investment of the U.S. shale oil boom, people with knowledge of the deliberations said.The expansion of the 344,600 barrel-per-day (bpd) Beaumont refinery, if carried out, would be completed by 2020 and potentially double its size with the addition of a third crude distillation unit (CDU), the sources said. More modest near-term projects to renew and expand so-called coking units to help refine more heavy crude already are under way, they said.If Exxon presses ahead, the investment would be a further indication that the American oil giant is breaking ranks with many of its big global rivals, who have been looking to sell off refining assets across the world. Just weeks ago Exxon unveiled a $1 billion investment in its Antwerp plant.An Exxon spokesman, while declining to discuss possible plans for the Beaumont refinery, said the company was always evaluating growth options.""We regularly evaluate our global portfolio of businesses and opportunities for growth, depending upon the fit with its strategic business objectives,"" Exxon spokesman Todd Spitler said. ""We take a disciplined long-term approach to investing, regardless of the economic cycle.""A bigger Beaumont would bolster the U.S. Gulf Coast's position as a top global supplier of gasoline and diesel at a time when domestic demand is falling. Profits for Gulf Coast refiners have swollen as cheaper North American crude allows them to capture big margins when exporting refined products.U.S. oil production has embarked on an unprecedented 50 percent rise over the past four years as new drilling techniques allowed oil to flow from vast shale reserves in North Dakota and Texas - this after two decades of seemingly irreversible decline. The sources said Exxon already was moving forward on plans to replace four coking unit drums in 2015 and add two new coker drums in 2017 at the Beaumont refinery. The drums turn residual crude oil into petroleum coke, a coal substitute.Exxon announced plans on July 2 to invest $1 billion to build a delayed coking unit at its 320,000 bpd Antwerp, Belgium, refinery so the plant could refine cheaper high-density, high-sulfur crude oils. That was on top of a previous $1 billion in upgrades to the Antwerp refinery. Exxon's Antwerp investments in some ways bucked a trend in recent years that has seen major integrated oil companies cut refining capacity with BP selling plants in Texas and California and Royal Dutch Shell shutting a refinery in Australia.   THIRD CDU The Beaumont refinery has two CDUs that do the initial refining of crude oil coming into the refinery and provide feedstock for all other units. Exxon officials are considering boosting the Beaumont refinery’s size to at least 500,000 bpd, which is close to the capacity of the company’s Baton Rouge, Louisiana, refinery.The country's biggest refinery is Motiva Enterprises LLC's [MOTIV.UL] 600,250 bpd Port Arthur, Texas, plant. Exxon is considering making the Beaumont plant bigger than Motiva's Port Arthur refinery.""They've talked between 700,000 and 800,000 bpd in total refinery capacity,"" one of the sources said.Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC, a Houston consultancy, said an Exxon expansion could boost profits.""Given the increase in North American oil production and in conjunction with the low operating cost due to the price of natural gas, it seems increasing the capacity of oil refining facilities makes a lot of sense,"" Lipow said. Beaumont Mayor Becky Ames said she had not been informed of any plans by Exxon to expand the Beaumont refinery.But she said the expansion would lead to more direct and indirect jobs for the area, which she said benefits from regional oil refining and petrochemical plants.""When they do an expansion anywhere in the area it not only means more jobs from the work itself, but it creates spin-off businesses in the community,"" Ames said.The two other most recent major expansions of Gulf Coast refining capacity - at Motiva's Port Arthur refinery and Marathon Petroleum Corp's Garyville, Louisiana, plant -were planned before the sudden rise in shale output started about seven years ago.Motiva, a joint venture between Shell and Saudi Aramco [SDABO.UL], invested $10 billion to expand its Port Arthur refinery from 285,000 bpd. In addition to a 325,000 bpd CDU, the project added multiple units and was completed in 2012.Marathon invested $3.9 billion to boost its Garyville, Louisiana, refinery from 256,000 bpd to 436,000 bpd in 2009.

Problems in overseas economies added to the bearish tone, with Argentina defaulting on its debt for the second time in 12 years.""If we start to see wages moving higher that's got a be a signal that we are getting closer to the Fed's mandates,"" said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial in Newark, New Jersey.Policymakers for the Fed, which has kept overnight rates near zero since December 2008, at the close of a two-date meeting on Wednesday took note of both faster economic growth and a decline in the unemployment rate, though they expressed concern about remaining slack in the labor market.On Thursday, all 10 macro S&P 500 sectors ended down on the day, with energy down 2.4 percent and leading the decline. Exxon Mobil Corp's second-quarter earnings beat expectations but production dropped, and its shares fell 4.2 percent to $98.94. The CBOE Volatility index, often referred to as Wall Street's fear gauge, jumped 27.2 percent to close at 16.95, its highest level since April 11.Based on the latest available data, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 317.06 points, or 1.88 percent, to 16,563.3. The S&P 500 lost 39.4 points, or 2 percent, to 1,930.67, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 93.13 points or 2.09 percent, to 4,369.77.Volume was much heavier than average. About 7.8 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, well above the 5.6 billion average for the month to date, according to data from BATS Global Markets. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq both marked their biggest daily percentage drops since April 10. For the Dow, the percentage drop was the biggest since Feb. 3.In a signal of possible further losses ahead, the S&P 500 closed below its 50-day moving average for the first time since April 15.For the month, the Dow was down 1.6 percent, the S&P 500 was down 1.5 percent, and the Nasdaq was down 0.9 percent.Investors on Wednesday had hoped for a midnight deal over Argentina's debt talks with holdout creditors, but the plan fell through. Even a short default will raise companies' borrowing costs, add to pressure on the peso, drain dwindling foreign reserves and fuel what is already one of the world's highest inflation rates.In Russia, news agencies reported that Russia banned soy imports from Ukraine and may restrict Greek fruit and U.S. poultry in what could be responses to new Western sanctions over Ukraine.After the bell, shares of LinkedIn jumped 8.9 percent to $196.70 after the corporate networking site reported a 47 percent increase in quarterly revenue and forecast better-than-expected adjusted profit and revenue in the current quarter.During the regular session, Kraft Foods Group  shares fell 6.4 percent to $53.59.

134,"   By Ernest Scheyder  Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N), the world's largest publicly traded oil company, reported a stronger-than-expected quarterly profit on Thursday as higher prices for its crude and natural gas offset a 6 percent drop in production.Exxon has struggled in recent quarters to replenish its reserves quickly, investing in massive new projects in Russia and Papua New Guinea that take years to develop. Meanwhile, many of its smaller, more-nimble peers have aggressively developed shale formations around North America, fueling massive production and exciting Wall Street.    ""Declining production is a recurring theme for Exxon Mobil,"" said Edward Jones analyst Brian Youngberg. ""The company remains growth-challenged, and a lot of that is due to their large size.""Adding to the company's challenges are Western sanctions against Russia, since Exxon is more involved in that country than any other U.S. oil company. Lukoil (LKOH.MM), Russia's second-largest oil producer, said on Wednesday that the sanctions would force it to slash capital spending due to limited access to funds. Exxon is partnering with Lukoil peer Rosneft (ROSN.MM) to develop a large oil field off the eastern Russian coast, and analysts said Lukoil's announcement could be the harbinger of funding challenges for the entire industry in Russia.  Exxon said net income rose to $8.78 billion, or $2.05 per share, from $6.86 billion, or $1.55 per share, a year earlier.    Analysts on average had expected earnings of $1.86 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Part of the increase in profit was due to a gain from Exxon's sale of its 60 percent stake in a Hong Kong utility and power storage firm earlier this year. Unlike others on Wall Street, Exxon does not typically offer an ""adjusted"" earnings number. Youngberg said that if the company had backed out the gain from the Hong Kong sale, its profit would have missed expectations.    Production fell 6 percent to 3.8 million barrels of oil equivalent per day. While the drop is not a positive, investors should not see it as the beginning of a negative trend, said Oliver Pursche of Gary Goldberg Financial Services, who manages Exxon shares for clients. ""The bigger question beyond production is what their future exploration looks like,"" he said. ""And I would say there's certainly opportunity there for them to make up for this dip in production with fresh reserves.""

About four years of early evaluations and drilling have so far yielded one large find - Fuling field - in the most prospective gas province of southwest Sichuan, but experts say the Fuling success is hard to repeat due to complex geology and high cost of production. Citing Wu Xinxiong, the head of China's National Energy Administration, industry website www.cpnn.com.cn reported that China aims to pump 30 billion cubic meters (bcm) of shale gas by 2020, versus an earlier goal of 60-80 bcm mapped out in 2012. ""The previous targets were more of a vague prospect, a hope. 30 bcm is a more realistic goal,"" said a government source who was briefed on the new target.     The revision, which is pending government finalization, would be negative for oil service sector companies that were hoping to cash in on the major drilling activity needed to reach the earlier target.""This is clearly negative for sentiment for some of the China oil service sector firms such as Anton Oilfield ,"" said Scott Darling, head of Asia Oil and Gas research of JPMorgan in Hong Kong. ""This admission on shale gas reflects the challenges facing China’s natural gas market.""It also means China would continue to focus on tapping easier-to-unlock gas resources, such as tight gas, which the Chinese oil firms are more experienced in, to reach a government-set total gas supply target of up to 420 bcm by 2020. China's tight gas output may hit 80 bcm by 2020, according to forecasts by the China Academy of Engineering, doubling its estimated output of 40 bcm in 2013.  The new 30 bcm shale gas target would mostly be contributed by the country's top two state oil firms, PetroChina and Sinopec Corp, experts have said, as they hold the majority of the country's oil and gas blocks, as well as the  expertise.  The government's efforts, led by the Ministry of Land and Resources, to open up the shale gas sector to independent players have had small success, as the blocks the ministry has to offer are of poorer quality and would entail hefty exploration costs.  Attempts by international firms to participate in the shale gas development have not been wholly fruitful either, with Royal Dutch Shell and Hess Corp the only foreign firms that have landed production sharing contracts, while most of them, including Exxon Mobil and BP, have barely progressed beyond the preliminary stage of studying the blocks.

144,"  (Adds analyst's comments, background)BEIJING Aug 7 China has halved the quantum of shale gas it expects to produce by 2020 after early exploration efforts to unlock the unconventional fuel proved challenging, according to an industry website and a government source.China, believed to hold the world's largest technically recoverable shale resources, is hoping to replicate the shale boom that has transformed the energy landscape of the United States.About four years of early evaluations and drilling have so far yielded one large find - Fuling field - in the most prospective gas province of southwest Sichuan, but experts say the Fuling success is hard to repeat due to complex geology and high cost of production.Citing Wu Xinxiong, the head of China's National Energy Administration, industry website www.cpnn.com.cn reported that China aims to pump 30 billion cubic metres (bcm) of shale gas by 2020, versus an earlier goal of 60-80 bcm mapped out in 2012. ""The previous targets were more of a vague prospect, a hope. 30 bcm is a more realistic goal,"" said a government source who was briefed on the new target.The revision, which is pending government finalization, would be negative for oil service sector companies that were hoping to cash in on the major drilling activity needed to reach the earlier target. ""This is clearly negative for sentiment for some of the China oil service sector firms such as Anton Oilfield  ,"" said Scott Darling, head of Asia Oil and Gas research of JPMorgan in Hong Kong. ""This admission on shale gas reflects the challenges facing China's natural gas market.""It also means China would continue to focus on tapping easier-to-unlock gas resources, such as tight gas, which the Chinese oil firms are more experienced in, to reach a government-set total gas supply target of up to 420 bcm by 2020. China's tight gas output may hit 80 bcm by 2020, according to forecasts by the China Academy of Engineering, doubling its estimated output of 40 bcm in 2013.The new 30 bcm shale gas target would mostly be contributed by the country's top two state oil firms, PetroChina  and Sinopec Corp, experts have said, as they hold the majority of the country's oil and gas blocks, as well as the  expertise.The government's efforts, led by the Ministry of Land and Resources, to open up the shale gas sector to independent players have had small success, as the blocks the ministry has to offer are of poorer quality and would entail hefty exploration costs.Attempts by international firms to participate in the shale gas development have not been wholly fruitful either, with Royal Dutch Shell and Hess Corp the only foreign firms that have landed production sharing contracts, while most of them, including Exxon Mobil and BP, have barely progressed beyond the preliminary stage of studying the blocks.

148,"  (Adds comment from ExxonMobil spokesman, Credit Suisse report, paragraphs 9-12)MEXICO CITY Aug 11 Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto on Monday signed a package of laws that will serve as a rule book for comprehensive energy reform designed to lure billions of dollars in investment to the country's ailing oil, gas and electricity sectors.Pena Nieto has made the energy overhaul the top economic priority of his administration, which aims to boost slumping growth in the world's 15th biggest economy.He said at a ceremony at the national palace that the energy ministry will announce two next steps in the reform later this week. A so-called Round Zero allocation of oil and gas fields that Pemex will keep is to be unveiled on Wednesday.The energy ministry will also announce which fields will be put up for grabs for foreign and private oil companies in the first round of public tenders, expected to take place next year. The reform ends the decades-long monopoly enjoyed by Mexico's two state-owned energy behemoths, national oil company Pemex and electricity utility CFE. It opens up new opportunities for investment across the industry.International oil majors like Royal Dutch Shell and ExxonMobil have been monitoring the legislative process and are widely expected to compete for newly established development contracts and licenses as early as next year. ""Mexico has created a solid framework to make the energy sector more competitive and attractive to private investment,"" said Shell Mexico President Alberto De La Fuente in an emailed response to questions.""We will review strategic opportunities in Mexico that could generate value for both our company and the country,"" he added. Patrick McGinn, a spokesman for ExxonMobil's upstream division, said the company welcomes the reform but emphasized that future projects in Mexico will have to compete.""We will pursue potential investment opportunities in Mexico that are competitive with other opportunities around the world,"" he said.Credit Suisse said in a report issued Monday that the accelerated timeline announced by Pena Nieto ""should bring more (investment) interest"" to the sector.The bank's research unit added that oil companies will ""be able to choose from a wide array of options and analyze them with enough lead time, increasing the likelihood that the formal biddings are carried out in a timely manner.""

150,"   By Steve Quinn | JUNEAU  JUNEAU Aug 12 Alaskans will vote on Aug. 19 to repeal or uphold a new law that cut taxes on oil production and is worth as much as $1 billion annually to North Slope producers Conoco Phillips, BP Plc and Exxon Mobil Corp , depending on oil prices.Should voters repeal the eight-month old law ushered in by Gov. Sean Parnell, the state would revert to the system implemented by Parnell's old boss Sarah Palin, whose signature legislation in 2007 raised taxes.The debate is highly charged. Supporters of the tax break say it will help reverse a long-term slide in oil output from Alaska, which trails production from Texas and North Dakota.Ads and editorials about the issue are flooding the airwaves, websites and newspapers daily. And industry-backed groups are outspending the repeal group by a large margin, according to campaign records. Those who support the new tax system, which removes a surcharge levied when market prices climb, say it will spur investment and that it has already started to encourage new drilling.Repeal supporters call Parnell's More Alaska Production Act a ""giveaway,"" fearing the oil companies will harvest profits made in Alaska and invest in other parts of the world. They insist Parnell's legislation won't address the decline, citing the state's own forecasts, which call for a drop from 536,000 barrels per day in fiscal year 2014 to 321,000 per day in fiscal year 2023. In their recent quarterly earnings review with analysts, ConocoPhillips and BP addressed the upcoming vote and their take on the law Parnell signed last year, which took effect Jan. 1.""We believe it's important for continued oil and gas development in Alaska, where we have identified and are actively developing opportunities for growth,"" Conoco's Matt Fox, executive vice president for exploration and production, told analysts on July 31. In a separate call with analysts, Bob Dudley, BP's Group Chief Executive, mentioned the new oil legislation during his July 29 review of the company's Alaska operations.""We're investing more and speeding up some of the work that we have been doing in Prudhoe Bay,"" he said.Any repeal might not last long. Lawmakers said they expect a repeal would simply force them back to the drawing board for another revision.

""We are in a number of markets already and as oil majors divest of more (downstream) businesses, there's just going to be more opportunity. We have to react to those,"" he added.The company said it had agreed in principle to acquire Esso's 274 unmanned petrol stations, 48 motorway concessions and supply contracts, which would give it a 4 percent share of the French market.The FTSE-250 firm has spent around 1.1 billion euros over the past 10 years on acquisitions and investments as part of its wider strategy to build a larger presence in the transport fuel sector across the United Kingdom and Europe. It is the company's first acquisition in France and second major deal in the European unmanned retail petrol station market, following its acquisition of Sweden's Qstar in February.The deal is expected to complete in the first half of 2015 and would see DCC operate the stations under Esso's brand. Breen said the company had spent 90 million pounds this year on acquisitions so far and that it aimed to spend around 150-200 million each year.Shares in DCC were up 1.4 percent to 3,507 pence by 1107 GMT.""We have increased our earnings estimates for 2015/16 and 2016/17 on the back of today's announcement that DCC has agreed to acquire Esso's unmanned and motorway retail petrol station network in France,"" said Panmure analyst Gert Zonneveld.""The acquisition should initially enhance group earnings per share by around 10p on a full year basis.

165,"   By Timothy Gardner | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The United States and European Union plan to stop billions of dollars in oil exploration in Russia by the world's largest energy companies including Exxon Mobil Corp and BP Plc, U.S. government sources said.The planned sanctions over Russia's aggression toward Ukraine would ban U.S. and European companies from cooperating with Russia on searching its Arctic territory, deep seas or shale formations for crude, said two U.S. officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because the measures have not been made public.The measures, which one of the sources said represented ""preliminary thinking,"" would expand sanctions the Obama administration announced in July and ban U.S. and EU cooperation on all energy services and technology in the unconventional oil fields. The previous sanctions only banned some technology at those locations.Russia, along with the United States and Saudi Arabia, is one of the world's top oil producers and is the main energy supplier to Europe. But its conventional oil fields are in decline, so it must move to frontier sources in Siberia and the Arctic to keep the oil flowing.  Exxon signed a $3.2 billion agreement in 2011 with Russian company Rosneft Oil Co to develop the Arctic. The Texas-based multinational was considered one of the few companies capable of drilling in the harsh, deep waters there. The new sanctions, if applied, would be harmful to Russia's future prospects because they would target fields five or 10 years from producing oil.

The planned sanctions were first reported by Bloomberg. European Union officials have delayed a decision on whether to implement measures against Russia. They will meet for further talks on Thursday.Once the EU implements the new ban on sharing energy technology and services, the United States would follow suit with similar measures, including barring the export of U.S. gear and expertise for the specialized exploration that Russians are unequipped to pursue on their own. Last week, a U.S. envoy in Brussels told Reuters that Washington is considering limiting high-tech exports to Russia's Arctic energy industry as part of plans to strengthen sanctions.THE GLOVES COME OFF Any new sanctions on services and technology related to Russia's oil frontier would signal that the United States and EU are ""taking the gloves off and are aiming directly at the major source of Russia’s potential future energy production growth,"" said Robert McNally, a White House energy adviser to former President George W.

167,"   By Mike Stone | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Venezuela's state-run oil company PDVSA [PDVSA.UL] is seeking preliminary offers for its U.S. unit Citgo Petroleum Corp [PDVSAC.UL] by the end of September, a deal that could fetch up to $10 billion, according to two people familiar with the matter.Venezuela is selling Citgo in part due to a cash crunch stemming from repaying debts to Beijing with oil, rather than selling the crude to generate revenue, analysts say. The government denies a cashflow problem exists.Within President Nicolas Maduro's government, the potential sale is controversial and seen as a privatization that would contradict years of socialist policies, including a nationalization of the oil industry in 2006 and 2007.   Investment bank Lazard Ltd, which is running the sale process for Citgo on behalf of PDVSA, has sent offering materials to potential buyers, the people said in recent days, asking not to be named because the matter is not public.PDVSA also has a 50 percent stake in the Chalmette refinery in Louisiana alongside Exxon Mobil Corp, which owns the remainder. The Venezuelan oil company has tapped Deutsche Bank separately to explore a sale of its stake in that refinery. The assets being offered as part of the Lazard process have annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of around $1.5 billion, four people said.Citgo's assets, the core of which are three refineries with combined capacity of 749,000 barrels per day (bpd), could fetch between $8 billion and $10 billion, three of the people said. Venezuela's former Petroleum Minister, Rafael Ramirez, said last month that the country expects to receive ""more than that"" if it decides to sell all the facilities.Ramirez, who was named foreign minister last week after a decade leading the country's petroleum industry, was pushing hard for Citgo's sale.He was replaced by Eulogio Del Pino, who is seen by the market as an experienced technocrat deeply involved in exploration and production projects.Citgo has 48 petroleum product terminals, three fully owned pipelines and six jointly owned pipelines in the United States. Its brand is also carried on thousands of gas stations that are independently owned. Bidders can put in offers for individual assets, which include refineries, terminals, storage and wholesale operations, the people added. Representatives for Lazard could not be immediately reached, while PDVSA said it was ""looking into the matter.""Ramirez also said that the country will look to exit Citgo ""as soon as we receive a proposal that serves our interests."" A sale, if it were to come to fruition, would be Venezuela's biggest pullback ever from the U.S. refining market.Citgo's three refineries are in Lemont, Illinois; Lake Charles, Louisiana; and Corpus Christi, Texas.     Bidders for the refineries could include HollyFrontier Corp, Valero Energy Corp, Western Refining Inc, Tesoro Corp and PBF Energy Inc, people familiar with the matter said.However, it may be difficult to find a single buyer for all of Citgo's assets as two of the refineries are geared to run heavy crudes from Venezuela and U.S. refining companies are trying to maximize profits by buying cheap domestic light crudes, refinery experts have told Reuters.Beyond the sheer size of the deal and the attractiveness of the assets, antitrust issues could prohibit some bidders if they were to pursue a bid for all the assets, according to people familiar with the process.

172,"   By Timothy Gardner | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Exxon Mobil said on Friday it will wind down drilling in Russia's Arctic in the face of U.S. sanctions targeting Western cooperation with Moscow's oil sector, after the Obama administration granted a brief extension to safely mothball its operations. Washington extended sanctions on Russia last week over its aggression in Ukraine. The new measures seek to stop billions of dollars worth of cooperation between Western and Russian energy companies on oil drilling in Russia's Arctic, in Siberia and offshore. Companies have until Sept. 26 to stop the work.The U.S. Treasury Department gave Exxon a short extension to wind down a rig, beyond the 14 days outlined in the sanctions, the Texas-based oil major said on Friday without elaborating.""Following the short time extension, the license is non-renewable and no further work is permitted,"" Exxon spokesman Richard Keil told Reuters.In July, Exxon began moving a rig called West Alpha from Norway to the Russian Arctic. The company is hoping for a major crude discovery in the Kara Sea with Russian state oil company Rosneft, with which it signed a $3.2 billion agreement in 2011 to develop the region. Exxon said the Treasury granted a license to it and other U.S. contractors and individuals involved with the University-1 well, where the rig was drilling, ""to enable the safe and responsible winding down of operations"" related to the well.The sanctions could affect other major oil companies, including BP Plc and Royal Dutch Shell.An analyst said Friday's move showed the Obama administration's willingness to tailor sanctions to accommodate challenges associated with complicated business projects in Russia.  ""The flexibility it demonstrates offers serious relief to international oil and gas companies concerned about the reach and effect of tough U.S. sanctions,"" said Elizabeth Rosenberg, who worked on sanctions at the Treasury Department and now heads the energy program at the Center for a New American Security.  The Treasury Department said it does not comment on license applications or requests.The U.S. sanctions seek to slow Russia's future oil production by banning U.S. and European Union cooperation on all energy services and technology in Russia's unconventional oil fields. Russia is one of the world's top crude producers and the biggest supplier to Europe, but its reservoirs are in decline and it must look to new sources to retain its positions. DELAYS IN THE KARA SEA Before Exxon ceases operations, it must take measures to stabilize the well that could include plugging it with cement.Investment bank Simmons said the Kara Sea well, estimated to cost over $600 million, is one of the most important exploration prospects in the oil industry.The stoppage could delay plans for fully developing the Kara Sea fields in 2016 and 2017. Drilling results from the well had been expected to be revealed later this year, Simmons added. A drillship owned by North Atlantic Drilling Ltd, a unit of Seadrill Ltd, had reportedly been hired to do the work for more than half a million dollars per day.Earlier on Friday, Russian Natural Resources Minister Sergei Donskoi told Reuters that Exxon was continuing exploration drilling in the Kara Sea. He declined to provide details.Sources close to the project have said Exxon has no U.S. personnel on the rig.The prospect of sanctions on Russia has been a big issue for Exxon this year. It spent $6 million on lobbying the U.S. government in the first half of 2014, and listed Russian sanctions as one of its lobbying issues, according to disclosures filed to the U.S. Senate.Exxon also paid about another $170,000 to four outside firms for lobbying in the second quarter, largely tied to Russian sanctions, the disclosures show.Exxon shares closed up about 0.5 percent on the New York Stock Exchange at $97.12.

175,"   By Akane Otani | NEW YORK  NEW YORK The asset with the greatest prowess of late has been the U.S. dollar, and if its rally continues, it threatens to eat into the earnings of multinational companies. The greenback's recent gains have lifted the dollar index .DXY - a measure of the dollar's value relative to six currencies - for 10 consecutive weeks. That marks the dollar’s longest rally since the index was created in 1973 - and could pose significant headwinds to dollar-sensitive sectors of the market, particularly companies that respond to commodity prices affected by the greenback, and multinationals that do much of their business overseas.“For the past few years, the U.S. dollar has been trading in a relatively quiet trading range. This summer, something changed. We are now seeing a new uptrend develop,” said Adam Sarhan, founder and CEO of Sarhan Capital in New York.Analysts have already pointed fingers at the dollar for the decline in prices of commodities like precious metals, corn and oil in recent weeks.  U.S. multinationals with large streams of revenue from overseas also stand to lose. “If you’re a consumer products company that does a lot of business overseas, it’s not going to help you. If you’re a large tech company and you do a lot of business overseas, that’s not going to help you,” said Larry Glazer, managing partner at Mayflower Advisors in Boston.“If you look at Exxon, as well, they’re clearly very diversified but affected by the consequences of currencies.” Shares of Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) have lost 5 percent over the last 10 weeks even as the broader market hit repeated new highs. About 36 percent of Exxon's revenue comes from the United States, the rest from overseas.Yet dollar-driven losses in some parts of the market may be offset by gains in others, especially retail. Lower oil prices favor the consumer, who can pocket the savings or spend the cash in stores.“The stronger dollar benefits U.S. consumers because they are the lion’s share of the economy, and any time you get a tailwind for consumers, it’s good for the U.S. economy, at least in the short run,” Glazer said. Much of the calculus of whether the dollar’s rise will become a net negative for U.S. stocks depends on domestic inflation rates, as well as the speed and scale of the currency’s gains, market watchers said. ""The euro zone is fragile ... the British pound is also weak, and geopolitical or economic woes remain a threat. As long as it is a healthy and normal advance, they should be able to adjust and prepare for it,"" Sarhan said.""But if the move is very large, fast or erratic, those consequences [could] be immeasurable.""

The 155,000 barrel per day (bpd) refinery, in the south part of Los Angeles, is Exxon's only refinery in California and the second-smallest of its half-dozen plants in the United States.An Exxon Mobil spokesman said the company does not comment on market rumors or speculation, adding that the firm ""regularly evaluates its global portfolio of businesses and opportunities for growth, restructuring or divestment, in accordance with the company’s overall strategic business objectives.""He said ExxonMobil remains committed to conducting business in California. BP halted refining in the state with the sale of its Carson, California, plant to Tesoro last year. Shell sold its Wilmington refinery to Tesoro in 2007, leaving it with a single plant in the state. California's environmental regulations make it a difficult state for refiners to operate in. Refiners including Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Tesoro and Valero already operate two or more refineries in the state, limiting their ability to buy others.Despite regulatory difficulties, PBF Energy Inc has said it has mulled refinery purchases in the state.  PBF has been ""looking at opportunities particularly in California, and we say particularly in California because that's where most of the opportunities have been, it's a market where we have as a team experience, it's a very difficult market,"" Executive Chairman Tom O'Malley said on the company's earnings call last month. ""I always warn our team that when we look at California, we must look at it to some degree almost as a different country and as a different set of requirements, but we're familiar with them and certainly we have lived with them in the past."" PBF did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Other potential buyers could include private equity firms, according to the two people.

""We continue to work toward restoring normal operations,"" said Exxon spokesman Lee Dula.

""They're spending an astronomical amount of money getting it fixed.""The work on the 65,000-bpd hydrocracker has already been pushed back from late August to October. A hydrocracker uses hydrogen to make motor fuels from gas oil produced by a refinery crude unit. Unlike the FCC, the hydrocracking unit makes nearly equal amounts of diesel and gasoline.

187,"   By Jessica Resnick-Ault  (This version of the Sept. 19th  story corrects company name in paragraph 7 to Phillips 66, not ConocoPhillips)  By Jessica Resnick-Ault (Reuters)- Exxon Mobil Corp. has put its Torrance, California, refinery on the block, according to two people familiar with the matter, making it the latest big oil company to consider exiting the state amid tougher environmental standards.""Torrance has been looked at extensively,"" said one of the people, who was not authorized to speak about the sale.  The 155,000 barrel per day (bpd) refinery, in the south part of Los Angeles, is Exxon's only refinery in California and the second-smallest of its half-dozen plants in the United States.An Exxon Mobil spokesman said the company does not comment on market rumors or speculation, adding that the firm ""regularly evaluates its global portfolio of businesses and opportunities for growth, restructuring or divestment, in accordance with the company’s overall strategic business objectives.""He said ExxonMobil remains committed to conducting business in California. BP halted refining in the state with the sale of its Carson, California, plant to Tesoro last year. Shell sold its Wilmington refinery to Tesoro in 2007, leaving it with a single plant in the state. California's environmental regulations make it a difficult state for refiners to operate in. Refiners including Chevron, Phillips 66, Tesoro and Valero already operate two or more refineries in the state, limiting their ability to buy others.Despite regulatory difficulties, PBF Energy Inc has said it has mulled refinery purchases in the state. PBF has been ""looking at opportunities particularly in California, and we say particularly in California because that's where most of the opportunities have been, it's a market where we have as a team experience, it's a very difficult market,"" Executive Chairman Tom O'Malley said on the company's earnings call last month.  ""I always warn our team that when we look at California, we must look at it to some degree almost as a different country and as a different set of requirements, but we're familiar with them and certainly we have lived with them in the past.""PBF did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Other potential buyers could include private equity firms, according to the two people. Exxon's Torrance refinery has imported crude from Australia, Ecuador, and Chad since 2012, according to Energy Information Administration data.

189,"  * Widodo to also impose major changes at state-owned Pertamina* To cut coal exports to ensure ample domestic supplies   (Adds details, fresh quotes)By Wilda AsmariniJAKARTA, Sept 23 Indonesian president-elect Joko Widodo plans to halt operations at Pertamina's energy trading unit Petral to allow for an audit of its operations as part of efforts to fight alleged fuel smuggling and corruption, a senior adviser to Widodo said.In his first energy action plan since being confirmed as president-elect by the Constitutional Court last month, Widodo will also impose major changes at state-owned Pertamina and cut coal exports to ensure ample domestic supplies for power plants.The former OPEC member has been hit hard by falling oil production, insufficient gas infrastructure and a series of corruption scandals that have led to the downfall of top energy officials. The situation has scared off foreign investors and forced Indonesia to become a major fuel importer, the main driver behind the country's fiscal and current account deficits.""The (new) government's action plans include ensuring the presence of the state to become a commander in making the right decisions, quickly and decisively to reform energy sector governance,"" said Hasto Kristiyanto, a senior figure in Widodo's transition team, in a statement released late Monday. The new administration plans to suspend the activities of oil traders at Petral and give responsibility for purchasing fuel and crude oil to its state-owned parent company during the investigation. It did not say when it would take such action.""Petral will be frozen and an investigative audit will be conducted,"" Kristiyanto said. ""Purchases of crude and fuel will be conducted by Pertamina and executed in Indonesia.""Pertamina and Petral officials were not immediately available for comment.Petral, which started trading for Pertamina in 2009, trades Indonesian as well as foreign crude oil and oil products. Its markets are mostly in the Asia Pacific region as well as the United States, Europe, Middle East and Africa. Government officials estimate that as much as 5 percent of Indonesia's fuel is smuggled and sold to neighbouring countries such as Singapore and Malaysia.Indonesian police this month said that four people, including two navy contractors and an official from Pertamina, were arrested for their involvement in a five-year-long fuel smuggling operation worth millions of dollars.Widodo plans to also impose major changes at Pertamina. ""Pertamina will be transformed into a non-listed public company to improve managerial capability ... and national human resources,"" Kristiyanto said.""Pertamina must be free from political interference.""Pertamina will also be asked to take responsibility for the appointment of oil and gas work areas, contract extensions, logistics and production controls, and the management of expiring energy contracts. Kristiyanto did not specify which contracts would be affected.Oil and gas contracts held by Exxon Mobil Corp, Total SA, Chevron Corp and PetroChina Co Ltd  are due to expire during Widodo's five-year term.Widodo also wants to reduce coal exports to provide more supplies to power plants, but Kristiyanto did not say by how much shipments would be reduced.Indonesia is the world's top exporter of thermal coal, but the outgoing government has imposed a series of regulations that are expected to hurt shipments starting next month.

Japan is the biggest LNG importer in the world, and some 10 percent of its imports come from Russia. Japan accounted for almost 82 percent of total LNG sales from Russia's Sakhalin-2 LNG plant last year, which produced 10.8 million tonnes.Russia plans to add two more LNG plants in the far east of the country towards the end of the decade: Gazprom's  Vladivostok LNG and Rosneft's and ExxonMobil's  plant on Sakhalin. It also plans to expand Sakhalin-2. Asked whether Tokyo Gas - which buys Sakhalin-2 LNG - plans to buy LNG from any new Russian LNG plant, Muraki said: ""At this moment, (because) of the sensitivity of the sanctions, probably before some resolution comes out for the sanctions it is a bit difficult for us to make new commitments."" On Wednesday, Japan imposed more sanctions on Russia because of Moscow's involvement in the Ukraine conflict, including banning certain Russian banks from issuing securities in Japan.Gazprom Deputy Chairman Alexander Medvedev told Reuters on Tuesday the company plans to start marketing LNG from Vladivostok soon, aiming to launch the plant in 2018-2019 as planned.

193,"  * Rosneft, Exxon complete drilling of Universitetskaya-1 well* Rosneft says discovered oil is comparable to Siberian Light oil* Exxon's work in Russia in doubt due to sanctions over UkraineBy Vladimir SoldatkinMOSCOW, Sept 27 Russia's top crude oil producer Rosneft said on Saturday it had made an oil discovery jointly with ExxonMobil at an offshore Arctic field, which has been at the centre of controversy due to Western sanction against Moscow.However, further progress at the site is likely to be problematic as international oil majors have to wind down work in Russia due to Western sanctions following the Ukraine crisis.Rosneft and its head Igor Sechin were among the targets of the sanctions, imposed over Moscow's role in the Ukrainian conflict, which has claimed the lives of more than 3,000 people. The sanctions, introduced by the United States and European Union, effectively freeze access by Russian companies to foreign technology and ban Western companies from cooperating in the Arctic, as well as in shale exploration and deep-water drilling.Rosneft said on Saturday it and ExxonMobil had successfully completed drilling of the Universitetskaya-1 well, the most northerly well in the world, located in the East-Prinovozemelskiy-1 license area in the Kara Sea oil province, where oil reserves are estimated to be comparable to those of Saudi Arabia.""The first oil was extracted. It is an astonishing sample of light oil, which based on the results of the analysis performed, is comparable to Siberian Light oil,"" Sechin said in a statement on Rosneft's web site. He said Rosneft would like to call the discovered field ""Pobeda"", Russian for victory. However it was not yet clear if commercially viable quantities of oil could be recovered from the well. Rosneft said data from the well will be analysed and only then could a conclusion be reached on the reserves there.SHORT EXTENSION  Exxon and Rosneft signed a $3.2 billion agreement in 2011 to develop the region.Exxon said last week the U.S. Treasury Department had given it a short extension to wind down a rig at the well, beyond the 14 days outlined in the sanctions targeting Western cooperation in Russia's oil sector.Russia is one of the world's top crude producers and the biggest supplier to Europe, but its reservoirs are in decline and it must look to new sources to retain its positions. Large-scale offshore oil production in Arctic is not expected before the middle of the next decade.Before sanctions, Rosneft had planned to tap other parts of the offshore Arctic, key for the future oil production in Russia, jointly with Exxon. A Rosneft spokesman declined to comment on whether those projects will go ahead in the light of sanctions.The prospect of sanctions on Russia has been a big issue for Exxon this year. It spent $6 million on lobbying the U.S. government in the first half of 2014 and listed Russian sanctions as one of its lobbying issues, according to disclosures filed to the U.S. Senate.Exxon also paid about another $170,000 to four outside firms for lobbying in the second quarter, largely tied to Russian sanctions, the disclosures show.

""Round One will present both (fields) that are in the hands of the state and Pemex farm-outs,"" the deputy energy minister for hydrocarbons, Lourdes Melgar, said at the event attended by executives of companies such as Exxon Mobil Corp and Royal Dutch Shell Plc.Round One will bid out 169 fields, including 60 already in production, spanning unconventional, or non-traditional, production areas along the U.S.-Mexico border, shallow and deepwater projects.""We believe if you put those thing together, (the companies) will be able to make a better investment decision,"" said Juan Carlos Zepeda, president of the National Hydrocarbons Commission, the newly beefed-up oil sector regulator. Round One plus the 10 joint ventures with Pemex is expected to generate about $50 billion in new investment by 2018.Publication of the calls for bids will start in November for the first shallow-water projects and Pemex joint ventures, with so-called data rooms containing geological information for the projects opening in January.Calls for bids on deepwater areas will be disclosed in March with corresponding data rooms open by May. Zepeda said ""virtual"" data rooms will also be accessible online, noting that more general oil and gas basin data will be released next month.The first shallow-water contracts will be awarded in May.Fiscal terms of the new contracts created by the reform - production and profit-sharing contracts as well as licenses - will vary by contract. All will include corporate income tax, surface rent, state and municipal taxes and a variable royalty.Variables used to determine contract winners will be set out in each contract and focus on the total government take in the form of taxes and royalties, plus investment commitments.The government has pledged new transparency measures requiring that contracts and all payments be made public as well as rules stipulating that at least two National Hyrdocarbons commissioners be present at meetings between regulators and companies.

199,"  HOUSTON Oct 2 Scrapping a decades-old ban on U.S. crude oil exports would spur job creation and boost energy security by encouraging new investment that lifts production, Exxon Mobil Corp's chief executive said on Thursday.Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson, speaking to a business group, said trade restrictions should also be lifted for exports of liquefied natural gas, or LNG, which are subject to lengthy regulatory reviews.Dozens of companies are lining up to export LNG and a superlight type of crude oil known as condensate as U.S. output of oil and gas has surged to a 25-year high, thanks to advances in hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling of tight oil fields. ""In the current debates about LNG and crude oil exports, economists and leaders from across the political spectrum, from all sides, agree that free trade would lead to increased investment, more jobs and, importantly, increased production,"" Tillerson said.

An initial round of bids was tabled at the end of September with several companies showing interest, the sources said.Representatives for Citgo and Lazard declined to comment. A representative for PDVSA was not immediately available to comment.The people said there has been robust interest in the Citgo refining assets among HollyFrontier Corp, Valero Energy Corp, Western Refining Inc, Reliance Industries Ltd and PBF Energy Inc.Representatives for Reliance, Western Refining, and  HollyFrontier, were not immediately available for comment.Representatives for Valero declined to comment, while a PBF Energy spokesman said that ""parties to transactions (like this) sign confidentiality agreements."" Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro said two weeks ago in New York that his plan was to ""keep strengthening"" the investment made in Citgo. Some observers thought that suggested Maduro might halt the divestment, but the sale process has continued, the people said asking not to be named because the matter is private.Companies that submitted an offer in the initial round of bidding had been called upon to present another, more detailed offer, one of the sources said.Another source added that Lazard is trying to ""refresh"" offers it had received, and remove some of the conditions bidders had initially put into their offers. One of the people said private equity firms had also submitted bids. Eventually private equity bidders would likely be partnered with industry players because the final buyer for the network of refineries, which have a joint capacity of 749,000 barrels per day (bpd), would need experience operating refineries, the sources added.Citgo's three refineries are in Lemont, Illinois; Lake Charles, Louisiana; and Corpus Christi, Texas.The U.S. operations, which also include terminals and pipelines, have annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of around $1.5 billion and could fetch between $8 billion and $10 billion, according to PDVSA's expectations. But PDVSA could get less than that, according to three analysts and consultants at firms, including Barclays. In addition, Bank of America Merrill Lynch warned that after paying creditors, PDVSA may only net $1.8 billion.PDVSA also has a 50 percent stake in the Chalmette refinery in Louisiana alongside Exxon Mobil Corp, which owns the remainder. The Venezuelan oil company has tapped Deutsche Bank  separately to explore a sale of its stake in that refinery.Plans to sell Citgo have been highly controversial in Maduro's government, with top officials supporting the divestment for financial and legal reasons and others presenting arguments against the action.People close to Citgo and the Venezuelan government said a final decision on the matter has not been made, even as the sales process continues and Venezuela's cash needs increase.A World Bank arbitration tribunal said on Thursday that it determined Venezuela must pay Exxon Mobil $1.6 billion to compensate for a 2007 nationalization, a decision that comes when cash-strapped Venezuela is struggling with a troubled economy and looming bond payments.A sale of some of all of Citgo' assets would be welcome as a cash relief for PDVSA and the Venezuelan government, according to analysts.

213,"   By Andrew Cawthorne and Diego Ore | CARACAS  CARACAS Venezuela will end up paying less than $1 billion to Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) for oil assets nationalized in 2007, after this week's World Bank tribunal award, the Venezuelan government said on Friday.Venezuela says it will deduct a previous award made against it by another international tribunal, the Paris-based International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), from Thursday's $1.6 billion ruling by the World Bank's ICSID body. ""In concrete, exact terms, our republic will have to cancel something less than $1 billion, that is to say 5 percent of Exxon Mobil's pretentions against our country,"" said Ramirez, who until a cabinet reshuffle several weeks ago, was head of the oil ministry and state oil company PDVSA.A senior PDVSA source told Reuters on Thursday that the company would pay the compensation ordered after November. Exxon received $908 million from PDVSA in 2012 after a separate decision by the ICC over the same claim, but had been seeking far more overall.    ""We're ready. We have no problem finishing up this determination and closing this chapter that became a menace to the economy of our nation,"" Ramirez added at a news conference.The case relates to the 2007 takeover of a large heavy crude project in the Orinoco region by then president Hugo Chavez's socialist government. Venezuela is hailing the outcome as a victory for its sovereignty over rapacious Western multinationals, and oil workers were shown celebrating on state TV on Friday. Exxon, though, has also expressed satisfaction, saying the decision vindicated its view it had not been properly compensated. PRECEDENT FOR CONOCO? Hot on the heels of the Exxon ruling, ConocoPhillips (COP.N) said on Friday it had also filed for arbitration at the ICC against PDVSA for compensation related to the termination of its partnership contract after a nationalization.  That ICC filing is separate from the U.S. oil company's arbitration pending before the World Bank's International Center for Settlement for Investment Disputes (ICSID).The cases come at a delicate time for Venezuela's finances, with the economy apparently entering recession - though official data has been suppressed - and multi-billion bond payments due. ""Although the government has downplayed the Exxon Mobil ruling, it clearly creates additional fiscal strains at a time when oil prices are falling and the sovereign and PDVSA face large external debt repayments,"" said the Economist Intelligence Unit's analyst Federico Barriga. ""Questions over Venezuela's capacity to pay have accentuated in recent months, given the dismal state of the economy and falling international reserves.""PDVSA is seeking to ease its debt burden through swaps. Despite Ramirez's estimate of an under-$1 billion payment to Exxon, Bank of America Merrill Lynch estimated the eventual cost at $1.027 billion, including interest, while Barclays put it at $1 billion to $1.2 billion. ""We expect the government to try to buy time before making the payment and do not think the ruling will affect the country's capacity to pay bonds maturing this month,"" Barclays analyst Alejandro Grisanti said.He added that the ruling set an important precedent for the Conoco case: ""Considering the size of the assets and Conoco's participation in the projects, Venezuela might have to pay around $4 bln,"" or about 20 percent of what the company wants.

A source at state oil company PDVSA familiar with the case told Reuters that, factoring interest into the ICSID-ordered compensation, the final amount would be reduced to roughly $1 billion. PDVSA took over Exxon's operations under the nationalization.""The award is a triumph, without doubt,"" said the source, adding PDVSA would pay as of November, after servicing its roughly $3 billion 2014 bond. The source asked not to be identified because he is not authorized to speak publicly. Exxon also claimed the upper hand. In a brief statement, the world's largest publicly traded oil company said the decision vindicated its view that Venezuela failed to compensate it fairly at the time. The company had been seeking roughly $10 billion in compensation.  Exxon added it held extensive discussions with PDVSA and the government but was unable to reach agreement on fair compensation. CHAVEZ-ERA TAKEOVERS The ICSID decision relates to the expropriation of the Cerro Negro project, the La Ceiba project, as well as ""production and export curtailments"" imposed on the Cerro Negro development in 2006 and 2007. ""The Tribunal has found that the expropriation was conducted in accordance with due process,"" ICSID said on its website.""The most important part of the decision is that the arbitration tribunal rejects the alleged 'illegal' nature of the expropriation,"" said Carlos Bellorin, petroleum analyst at IHS, meaning the compensation only reflects the value of the assets, not alleged damages and prejudice caused.""However, it is presumed the calculation method was not the one Venezuela suggested,"" he said. Each party will cover its own costs and counsel fees, ICSID said. The tribunal said it had no jurisdiction over ""the claim arising out of the increase in the income tax rate for the participants to the Cerro Negro Project.""Venezuela is facing more than 20 arbitration cases over the Chavez-era nationalizations. Many of the companies nationalized deemed the takeovers unlawful expropriations. Proponents of the nationalizations argue commodities-rich Venezuela should have the right to administer its own resources to try to improve living standards.    Several analysts said Venezuela had mostly dodged the bullet this time, but that other cases may prove trickier.ConocoPhillips has brought the biggest case to date against Venezuela, in 2007, seeking $30 billion in compensation. A partial decision in 2013 determined Venezuela failed to act in good faith or properly compensate ConocoPhillips for three big oil assets. A final decision is expected soon.Cash-strapped PDVSA appears to be seeking to sell Citgo Petroleum Corp, its U.S. refining unit which would be a welcome injection of liquidity for the company and the government.

217,"  (Add analyst quotes)By Andrew Cawthorne and Diego OreCARACAS Oct 10 Venezuela will end up paying less than $1 billion to Exxon Mobil Corp for oil assets nationalized in 2007, after this week's World Bank tribunal award, the Venezuelan government said on Friday.Venezuela says it will deduct a previous award made against it by another international tribunal, the Paris-based International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), from Thursday's $1.6 billion ruling by the World Bank's ICSID body.""In concrete, exact terms, our republic will have to cancel something less than $1 billion, that is to say 5 percent of Exxon Mobil's pretentions against our country,"" said Ramirez, who until a cabinet reshuffle several weeks ago, was head of the oil ministry and state oil company PDVSA.A senior PDVSA source told Reuters on Thursday that the company would pay the compensation ordered after November.Exxon received $908 million from PDVSA in 2012 after a separate decision by the ICC over the same claim, but had been seeking far more overall.""We're ready. We have no problem finishing up this determination and closing this chapter that became a menace to the economy of our nation,"" Ramirez added at a news conference. The case relates to the 2007 takeover of a large heavy crude project in the Orinoco region by then president Hugo Chavez's socialist government.Venezuela is hailing the outcome as a victory for its sovereignty over rapacious Western multinationals, and oil workers were shown celebrating on state TV on Friday.Exxon, though, has also expressed satisfaction, saying the decision vindicated its view it had not been properly compensated. PRECEDENT FOR CONOCO? Hot on the heels of the Exxon ruling, ConocoPhillips  said on Friday it had also filed for arbitration at the ICC against PDVSA for compensation related to the termination of its partnership contract after a nationalization.That ICC filing is separate from the U.S. oil company's arbitration pending before the World Bank's International Center for Settlement for Investment Disputes (ICSID).The cases come at a delicate time for Venezuela's finances, with the economy apparently entering recession - though official data has been suppressed - and multi-billion bond payments due. ""Although the government has downplayed the Exxon Mobil ruling, it clearly creates additional fiscal strains at a time when oil prices are falling and the sovereign and PDVSA face large external debt repayments,"" said the Economist Intelligence Unit's analyst Federico Barriga.""Questions over Venezuela's capacity to pay have accentuated in recent months, given the dismal state of the economy and falling international reserves.""PDVSA is seeking to ease its debt burden through swaps.Despite Ramirez's estimate of an under-$1 billion payment to Exxon, Bank of America Merrill Lynch estimated the eventual cost at $1.027 billion, including interest, while Barclays put it at $1 billion to $1.2 billion.""We expect the government to try to buy time before making the payment and do not think the ruling will affect the country's capacity to pay bonds maturing this month,"" Barclays analyst Alejandro Grisanti said.He added that the ruling set an important precedent for the Conoco case: ""Considering the size of the assets and Conoco's participation in the projects, Venezuela might have to pay around $4 bln,"" or about 20 percent of what the company wants.

Conoco is acting out of resentment, Eulogio Del Pino told an oil conference on Venezuela's Margarita Island.Separately, Venezuela is also facing over 20 other cases at a World Bank tribunal after a wave of nationalizations under the late President Hugo Chavez's socialist government. That tribunal on Thursday ordered Venezuela to pay Exxon Mobil Corp about $1.6 billion to compensate for oil nationalization in 2007. As that is far less than Exxon was seeking and Venezuela says it expects to ultimately only pay around $1 billion, the OPEC country hailed the ruling as a victory for its ""sovereignty.""But analysts warn the Conoco award may be a bigger blow to the cash-strapped country.""The (Exxon) ruling sets an important precedent for the Conoco case on nationalized assets in Venezuela,"" Barclays wrote in a note to clients.

Its website statement on policies to manage climate change emphasizes the need to minimize costs and to ""allow markets, not regulators"" to determine the technologies used. In an interview with Reuters at the Antwerp ground-breaking ceremony earlier this month, Refinery Manager Todd Sepulveda said it was regulatory certainty that was needed to protect long-term investments.He rattled off a list of reasons not to be in Europe -- headed by competition from a flood of refined products from the United States and elsewhere, and poor margins. ""Despite all of that, this particular refinery is one of our most strategic,"" he said. ""All of our investments are for the long term, the next 30 to 50 years.""The refinery is strategic because of its location in the port of Antwerp, a hub for northwestern Europe, and Exxon explains its decision to invest is based on sound business reasons rather than any EU policy.It says the refinery is well adapted to the challenges in Europe, which has yet to experience any boom in shale oil and gas that could lower the cost of the raw materials for refining.Still, energy makes up 60 percent of the costs at Antwerp, compared with 30-40 percent in the United States, Sepulveda said. To compensate, the plant is the most energy efficient of all Exxon's refineries, which are 10 percent more efficient than the average, according to industry benchmarking.""Refining is energy intensive and improving energy efficiency is good business,"" Sepulveda said. DEFEAT FOR ENVIRONMENT, VICTORY FOR CANADA   However little energy it burns, for climate campaigners, the Antwerp refinery expansion is a symbol of defeat.They blame the oil industry and a massive lobbying effort led by Canada for a European Commission U-turn on a policy that would have kept some of the most polluting fossil fuel out of Europe.

224,"   By Oleg Vukmanovic | MILAN, Oct. 10  MILAN, Oct. 10 Asian spot liquefied natural gas (LNG) prices sank lower amid poor demand for winter cargoes and as logjams outside Argentine ports sparked some distressed selling in the Atlantic, deepening the bear market.Production setbacks from Norway's Snoehvit export plant and possibly also in Nigeria did little to change the mood.The price of spot LNG for November delivery LNG-AS  slipped to $13.80 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) this week, compared with $14.20 per mmBtu last week.Bearish sentiment also spilled over into the December market, currently assessed in the mid- to high-$14 per mmBtu range as supplies improved and top buyers South Korea and Japan stayed on the sidelines.""Bad weather in Argentina kept ships from unloading and that created a glut of supply for the prompt...(Spain's) Gas Natural sold a distressed cargo to the Brazilians at around $11 per mmBtu when they couldn't deliver into Escobar,"" one trader said, referring to Argentina's Parana river terminal.Brazil's state-run energy company Petrobras picked up the cargo from Gas Natural, while at least one other distressed sale was completed in the Atlantic market.""The market will only pick up when the Chinese and South Koreans come back to the market, and that could be a matter of weeks ... at this point we're looking at mid-January forward prices for signs of demand,"" he said.""There is not a lot of supply for February and March, that's the tight spot now,"" he said. Falling prices are partly explained by the absence of demand from Korea Gas Corp., the world's biggest LNG buyer, as it struggled to absorb supplies arriving under long-term contracts.Kogas, as it is known, deferred deliveries of 40 summer cargoes until the winter. It ordinarily props up prices at this time of year by buying in September for November delivery.E.ON Global Commodities sold a cargo aboard the Kita liquefied natural gas (LNG) tanker to PetroChina for November delivery for a price in the mid-$14 per mmBtu range, traders said.E.ON loaded the cargo from Spain's Sagunto terminal in August as part of a strategy to store the fuel onboard the tanker until Asian spot prices recovered from summer lows. Other players have also pursued so-called floating storage trading strategies in the hope of profiting from the summer-winter price spread.Some of those positions are now starting to be cleared as costs associated with storing the cargo, which also gradually evaporates, increase the chance of a loss-making trade.E.ON chartered the Kita at a highly advantageous day-rate and, given the firm's downstream position in Spain, may have avoided paying market prices for the cargo, although other sources said Sagunto cargoes are typically Brent-price linked.The outcome of ExxonMobil's two-cargo tender from its Papua New Guinea export plant saw trader BG Group pick up a single November cargo at an undisclosed price. In a rare instance of coordinated trading, BG Group reciprocated by selling Exxon downstream gas supplies from Singapore's import terminal where it acts as a supply aggregator for the city state, a source with knowledge of the matter said.Exxon's Jurong Island oil and chemical refinery sits astride the LNG import terminal and BG's gas supplies likely were a feedstock for the facility.One trading manager in Singapore said BG sold Exxon 3.5 billion cubic feet (Bcf), citing an article by price reporting agency Platts.""Any cargo for delivery in the first half of November will be sub $14 which is feeding through into the December market... Reported pricing still has some fat in it,"" a trade source said.""The weak Brent crude oil price means that you will start to see buyers turning to every last drop of oil-linked supply when they can exercise upward quantity tolerance from January -- and that's going to reduce liquidity even more for spot markets,"" he said.Aside from faltering supply from Norway and Nigeria, Qatari liquefaction production plants, or trains, have been taking turns entering month-long maintenance outages since September.The maintenance periods are planned and should run through at least until the end of November and probably beyond.(Editing by David Evans)",2014-10-17,XOM,"Fri Oct 17, 2014 | 1:01pm EDT","Global LNG-Argentina drives distressed sales, BG, Exxon, E.ON strike deals",http://www.reuters.com//article/markets-lng-idUSL6N0SC4IV20141017?type=companyNews
225,"  * Says finalising evaluation of bids* Statoil, ExxonMobil, Gazprom among bidders* Raises gas reserve estimates to 53.2 tcf from 46.5 tcfBy Fumbuka Ng'wanakilalaDAR ES SALAAM, Oct 17 Tanzania is in final stages of evaluating bids for oil and gas blocks it offered in its latest bidding round and plans to pick the winners before the end of this year, its upstream regulator said on Friday.East Africa is a new hotspot in hydrocarbon exploration after substantial deposits of crude oil were found in Uganda and major gas reserves were discovered in Tanzania and Mozambique. ""The evaluation of bids is in the final stages and the results of this ongoing process will be made public when concluded,"" James Andilile, acting managing director of the state-run Tanzania Petroleum Development Corporation (TPDC), told Reuters. ""Winners of the successful bids should be announced this year.""Tanzania, a focus for natural gas exploration, received five bids in May for four of the eight oil and gas blocks it offered in its fourth offshore licensing round. In some of the blocks there were joint bids.ExxonMobil, Statoil, Russian gas producer Gazprom and state-run Chinese offshore oil and gas producer CNOOC Ltd are among companies that submitted bids. Abu Dhabi state-owned investment fund Mubadala and another United Arab Emirates firm, Ras Al Khaimah Gas LLC, also put forward bids.Tanzania, which has made big discoveries of natural gas off its southern coast, had offered seven deep-sea offshore blocks and one block in Lake Tanganyika.The deep sea offshore blocks are located in water depths of 2,000 to 3,000 metres adjacent to proven prospective blocks, while the Lake Tanganyika North block is in a water depth of 1,500-metres along the east African rift system, the government said in its bidding round announcement. Andilile also said the government had raised its estimate of recoverable natural gas resources to up to 53.2 trillion cubic feet (tcf) from 46.5 tcf previously following recent major discoveries offshore south of the country.""There have been recent big discoveries of natural gas in deep-see blocks by exploration companies, such as Statoil, and this has therefore increased the country's gas reserves,"" he said.Tanzania's energy ministry said it expected the country's gas resources to increase to 200 tcf by next year if new finds in east Africa's second-biggest economy prove productive.Tanzania has so far signed at least 25 production sharing agreements (PSAs) with some 17 international energy companies.Winners of the latest bidding round would be subjected to new PSA terms introduced in November that experts said toughen some of the conditions for energy firms seeking to explore and develop the nation's big gas prospects.

226,"  * Madagascar seeks to entice foreign investors after coup* Govt has licensed 24 exploration blocks, 225 available* New govt seeks to revive faltering economyBy George ObulutsaNAIROBI, Oct 17 Madagascar plans to issue licenses for three on-shore and up to 50 off-shore exploration blocks next year once parliament approves a new petroleum law, a senior energy ministry official said on Friday.Madagascar, famed for its wildlife and eyed by foreign companies for its minerals and its hydrocarbon prospects, has struggled to court oil and mining giants since a coup in 2009, which also prompted international donors to cut off ties. President Hery Rajaonarimampianina, who took office in January after a peaceful vote in December, has pledged to woo foreign investors and alleviate poverty which deepened after the 2009 coup when the economy slumped. The World Bank and other donors have since re-established ties and resumed aid flows.""The new petroleum code will be submitted to parliament at the end of this year, or for its next ordinary session in May 2015,"" Pascal Velonarivo, Director General of Hydrocarbons at the Ministry of Hydrocarbons, Madagascar, told an east African oil and gas conference in the Kenyan capital Nairobi. ""After the adoption of the new petroleum code by  parliament ... Madagascar will launch a bid round.""Velonarivo later told reporters the offshore blocks to be offered for licensing will number 30 to 50, with another three onshore blocks to be auctioned.""It must be next year,"" he said when asked about timing of the licensing round, adding all the required data for the blocks to be licensed had already been gathered. Madagascar has a total 249 exploration blocks, of which 24 have so far been licensed to exploration companies.Among the companies that hold licenses in Madagascar are Exxon Mobil, Tullow Oil, Madagascar Oil  and AfrenVelonarivo said among the changes in the revised law would be separation of roles for the state-run OMNIS, which acts as both a regulator and oil company, and revamping environmental regulations.""The new law is like the upgrading of the former law. There is confusion about the place of OMNIS, which plays the role of national oil company and the regulator. There is some upgrading about the environment,"" he said.

229,"  CARACAS Oct 27 The World Bank's international arbitration panel has temporarily suspended enforcement of an order that Venezuela pay Exxon Mobil Corp $1.6 billion in compensation for oil projects nationalized in 2007.The International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) said it had received a request from the Venezuelan government for a revision of the award, which was announced Oct. 9.""The Secretary-General registers an application for revision of the award filed by the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, and notifies the parties of the provisional stay of enforcement of the award,"" according to an ICSID statement dated Oct. 24.The case comes at a delicate time for Venezuela's finances, with the economy apparently entering recession - though official data has been suppressed - and multi-billion bond payments due.The South American country faces more than 20 arbitration cases over nationalizations carried out during the rule of late President Hugo Chavez, including a claim filed by ConocoPhillips  over oil projects the state took over in 2007. ICSID procedures allow parties to request clarification of a given ruling, which could lead the abitration panel to meet again.Exxon had asked a U.S. District Court to enforce the claim. Venezuela, which has said it will pay the award, has described the decision as a victory because it represented only a fraction of the $10 billion Exxon had been seeking.Exxon officials were not immediately available for comment. Neither Venezuela's oil ministry, nor state oil company PDVSA, responded to phone calls and emails by Reuters seeking comment.Chavez nationalized a range of oil projects, including the Cerro Negro heavy crude project and a smaller project called La Ceiba, both operated by Exxon.

236,"  (Adds details on Kearl production, share price)Oct 31 Imperial Oil Ltd, Canada's second-largest integrated oil producer and refiner, reported a 45 percent jump in third-quarter profit on Friday as it refined more crude oil at higher margins.Weak crude prices helped boost margins at the company's refining business, which accounts for three-quarters of its total revenue.Global oil prices have fallen by about 25 percent since June due to excess supply, including supply from North American shale fields, and slowing demand, particularly from China and Europe.Imperial, which is 69.6 percent owned by Exxon Mobil Corp , said it sold synthetic crude at an average of C$102.58($90.78) per barrel, down 10 percent from a year earlier.Average realized price for bitumen fell about 8 percent to C$74.82 per barrel. The impact of lower prices was offset by a near eight-fold jump in net income in Imperial's downstream business, which transports and refines crude oil into products such as gasoline and diesel. Revenue in the business rose 5 percent.However, weak crude prices hurt Imperial's upstream oil-and-gas production business significantly, slowing revenue growth in the unit to about 8 percent from 54 percent. Production at Imperial's Kearl oil sands mining project in northern Alberta averaged 78,000 barrels per day for the quarter, which included a 14-day maintenance shutdown.Excluding the shutdown, Imperial said Kearl output was 92,000 bpd.

241,"  (Adds comparison, stock, hedging data)By Ernest ScheyderNov 5 Continental Resources Inc, the largest oil producer in North Dakota's Bakken shale formation, posted a quarterly profit on Wednesday that met Wall Street's expectations, helped by higher oil production and a surprising decision to stop hedging the price of oil.The move to sell all crude oil hedge positions for the next three years netted Continental a $433 million one-time gain during the quarter.""We view the recent downdraft in oil prices as unsustainable given the lack of fundamental change in supply and demand,"" Chief Executive Harold Hamm said in a statement. ""We have elected to monetize nearly all of our outstanding oil hedges, allowing us to fully participate in what we anticipate will be an oil price recovery."" Hedging offers commodity producers protection from sharp price drops, though it can also limit profits if prices jump too high. By exiting hedging, Hamm is effectively betting that a more-than 25 percent drop in oil prices since June is but a short-term fluke bound to reverse course.The move was not unprecedented as Chevron Corp and Exxon Mobil Corp do little hedging for their own production.Yet in a bit of a strategic hedge, Hamm slashed Continental's 2015 capital spending budget by $600 million, saying he would not put more drilling rigs in the field while prices are low. Given that, Continental doesn't expect its production to jump as much as previously forecast next year. ""We are choosing not to accelerate development next year and will instead maintain our current pace,"" John Hart, Continental's finance chief, said.The company posted third-quarter net income of $533.5 million, or $1.44 per share, compared with $167.5 million, or 45 cents per share, in the year-ago period. Excluding the hedging gain and other one-time items, the company posted profit of 81 cents per share, meeting analysts' expectations, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Quarterly production rose 29 percent to an average of 182,335 barrels of oil equivalent per day.Hamm, who founded the Oklahoma City-based company in 1967, is in the midst of a bitter divorce battle with his wife Sue Ann. Since Hamm owns about 68 percent of the company, the divorce settlement holds vast implications.

242,"   By Catherine Ngai  BHP Billiton Ltd is set to be the first company to export lightly processed ultra-light U.S. oil without explicit permission from the government, further testing the limits of an increasingly contentious ban on foreign sales.Eight months after two other U.S. energy firms said they had received the first formal authorization to sell domestic condensate abroad, BHP said it had determined that its oil would also meet the legal criteria for export since it was being minimally processed in distillation towers in South Texas.""We took the necessary time to thoroughly examine the issues involved and ensure that the processed condensate was eligible for export,"" said a spokesman for BHP, the Anglo-Australian mining firm that is also one of the largest producers in the Eagle Ford shale patch in Texas.The Wall Street Journal, which first reported the exports, said the company had already contracted to sell a 650,000 barrel cargo to Switzerland-based Vitol, the world's largest independent oil trader. The BHP spokesman declined to discuss the volume, value or destination of the exports.Vitol chief Ian Taylor told Reuters Commodities Summit this week European politicians should put pressure on Washington to end the crude oil export ban. ""There's no doubt there's going to be more and more lobbying for the free flow of crude oil,"" Taylor said. A Vitol spokeswoman declined to comment on Wednesday on the destination of the exports.BHP's move comes as the U.S. mid-term elections put Republicans in control of both houses of Congress - an outcome many expect to hasten measures that would relax or end the ban on exporting crude, increasingly viewed as an outdated relic of the 1970s energy crisis.Even so, the decision to press ahead with sales, despite the regulatory uncertainty, surprises many experts who had expected other companies to await clear rulings rather than risk a financial and reputational backlash.""We had been skeptical that any company might self-classify processed condensate for export,"" Kevin Book, managing director of ClearView Energy Partners, said in a note.He said doing so was always possible, but carried risks, even after the U.S. Commerce Department told Pioneer Natural Resource Co and Enterprise Product Partners LP in March that they could export processed condensate. Just a few months after that decision, however, the Commerce Department placed an indefinite hold on some two dozen similar requests for so-called ""commodity clarifications,"" frustrating producers that saw their rivals fetching higher prices abroad.The recent fall in oil prices due to booming shale oil production has pushed U.S. crude to below $80 a barrel and is likely to sharpen pressure to ease the ban.Pioneer said on Tuesday it had exported six cargoes of condensate from the Eagle Ford shale patch since July with ""improved pricing"" compared to domestic rates.A spokesman for the Commerce Department could not be reached for comment. ""It remains to be seen whether another company will self-classify its processed condensate for export, but we would contend that the odds have increased in the wake of today’s news,"" said Book. Many refiners in Asia, however, are skeptical about taking on such supply risks in the absence of a clear U.S. ruling.""I don't think the U.S. government would like it, and even if such cargo is available, it will be hard to approach it,"" a Seoul-based refinery source said, speaking about BHP's plans and risks associated with buying condensate under those conditions.A crude trader with another South Korean refiner said: ""Even if they make contracts to do so, I don’t think actual cargoes will be delivered. Which refiner would take such a high risk if there was a prospect of no delivery?""ARAB EMBARGO BAN  U.S. law bans the export of crude oil, a legacy of the Arab oil embargoes in the 1970s. The United States does allow refined products such as gasoline and diesel to be shipped abroad.In March, the Commerce Department confirmed to Pioneer and Enterprise in a private ruling that ""processed condensate"" - which has been run through a very simple form of refining - would qualify as a refined product, not raw crude.""BHP Billiton has worked through a robust due diligence, secured a dedicated supply chain, and has taken steps to ensure the quality of our product for export. The processed condensate that BHP Billiton plans to export is not crude oil under BIS regulations,"" the spokesman said.Early last month, BHP told Reuters in an email that it had submitted an application to classify its Eagle Ford processed condensate as eligible for export. The Journal said that some of the condensate recently exported by Enterprise had come from wells run by BHP, giving it insight into the process.A spokesman for Senator Lisa Murkowski from Alaska, a leading proponent of exports, said BHP's move was ""consistent with our understanding of Commerce Department regulations, which do not require a license for export of a petroleum product.""BHP Billiton also has operations in the Permian in Texas, Haynesville shale in Louisiana and Fayetteville in Arkansas.In light of the drop in U.S. gas prices since it first bought into the shale plays in 2011 for $20 billion, including debt, the company has been focusing on boosting output from its liquids-rich shale assets, targeting 200,000 barrels per day in 2017, and recently put its Fayetteville holdings up for sale.Exxon Mobil Corp and other oil companies have been asking that the ban on crude exports be scrapped, saying it would spur job creation and boost energy security by encouraging new investment that boosts production.

243,"  (Adds Hamm quotes from conference call, stock movement)By Ernest ScheyderWILLISTON, N.D. Nov 6 Harold Hamm, chief executive of Continental Resources Inc, stunned a bearish crude market by scrapping all of the North Dakota energy producer's oil hedges, betting that prices will recover soon after sinking 25 percent in recent months.With the move, Hamm, who last month called OPEC a ""toothless tiger,"" appears to be heading into a price war with Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest oil exporter, without any protection from a prolonged downturn that some analysts say is looming.Saudi Arabia and 14 other OPEC members have shown no sign yet of moving to cut production, a step that would lift prices.The conventional wisdom is that the country, frustrated by a global supply glut caused by soaring United States output, is prepared to let prices fall to squeeze U.S. shale oil producers out of the market.But Hamm, striking a defiant tone, told investors Thursday the U.S. shale boom won't end any time soon.""We see OPEC worried about that and want to slow down what we're doing,"" he said.Indeed, North Dakota considers OPEC its ""chief competitor,"" Lynn Helms, head of the state's Department of Mineral Resources, said last month.PREMATURE VICTORY The sale of all its crude oil hedge positions from October through 2016 netted Continental a $433 million one-time gain for the current quarter. With the move, Continental is effectively declaring a premature victory over OPEC.The company did not consult with credit-rating agencies before pulling contracts and board members are confident about  the move, Hamm said. ""We believe the recent pullback in oil prices will ultimately prove to be beneficial to Continental,"" he said, adding he believes prices will rebound to at least $85 per barrel in the near term.Since they traded at more than $115 a barrel in mid-June, benchmark Brent crude futures have plunged to levels not seen since October 2010, closing near $83 a barrel on Wednesday.Still, Hamm showed at least part of his hand, admitting he would return to hedging production if prices returned to $100 per barrel.""That would be nice in the next few years,"" he said.Many energy experts said that when prices began falling in June, companies should have been carrying more hedging contracts that locked in high prices and protected them from low ones.""It's pretty unusual for a company to monetize all of its hedges. The fact that they're going basically unhedged on oil suggests that they're going to take on a bit more risk,"" said Leo Mariani, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. SHORT-TERM FLUKE? The rout in the price of oil has punished drillers like Continental, whose shares have plummeted more than 30 percent since June. Many analysts have forecast even lower crude prices.Hedging protects commodity producers from sharp price drops, though it can also limit profits if prices soar. By exiting the hedges, Hamm is effectively betting that the steep drop in oil prices is a short-term fluke that's bound to reverse course.To be sure, going ""naked"" without hedges is not unprecedented. Majors such as Chevron Corp and Exxon Mobil Corp do little hedging on their own production.And Continental did maintain its hedges on natural gas production, given the even-higher volatility in prices for that commodity. Philip K. Verleger, president of consultancy PKVerleger LLC and a one-time adviser to President Jimmy Carter, said Continental's decision on oil hedging may concern investors.""My expectation is that Continental's investors will rue this decision because it changes the firm's business,"" he said. ""Hedging provides an assured cash flow. By dropping the hedges the firm is gambling that prices go up. If they go down, Continental will go bust.""Shares of Continental were down more than 3 percent in afternoon trading on Thursday, a probable sign of Wall Street's displeasure with the move.SLOWER SPENDING Yet, in a bit of a strategic hedge, Hamm slashed Continental's 2015 capital spending budget by $600 million, saying he would not put more drilling rigs in the field while prices are low. Given that, Continental doesn't expect its production to jump as much as previously forecast next year.The company now expects a 2015 capital budget of $4.6 billion, down from a previous estimate of $5.2 billion.Continental, the largest producer in North Dakota's Bakken field, trimmed its estimate for output next year and now expects a 23-29 percent jump from 2014 levels. Hamm had previously forecast a 26-32 percent jump in 2015.The company runs 22 drilling rigs in North Dakota, a number that will drop to 19 next year due to various factors, executives said.Hamm, who founded the Oklahoma City-based company in 1967, is in the midst of a bitter divorce battle with his wife Sue Ann.Since Hamm owns about 68 percent of the company, the divorce settlement holds vast implications. During much of August and September, the CEO spent most days in court for his divorce trial, which may result in one of the largest divorce judgments in U.S. history.

246,"   By Fergus Jensen | JAKARTA  JAKARTA Nov 12 Efforts by Indonesia's new administration to attract investment to the country's troubled energy sector are being viewed favourably by energy giants Exxon Mobil and Chevron.Graft, regulatory, legal and contractual uncertainties have undermined energy investment in Southeast Asia's biggest economy. Aging wells and a lack of exploration have led to declining output and the former OPEC member is now a major fuel importer with soaring energy demands.President Joko Widodo has ordered his cabinet to simplify bureaucracy and de-bottleneck problem areas, Widhyawan Prawiraatmadja, a special assistant to the new energy minister, said on Wednesday.""We are facing a daunting task to bring back confidence, bring back credibility and bring back people who want to do business in Indonesia,"" Prawiraatmadja said at an investor conference.Long-delayed decisions, including on expiring oil and gas contracts such as the Mahakam block operated by Total, had been held up by vested interests, he said. According to new Coordinating Maritime Minister Indroyono Soesilo, who also oversees the energy ministry, the administration is compiling a list of areas the industry wants fixed, including a tax on land use being applied to oil and gas exploration.The push to improve regulatory efficiency is heading in the right direction, ExxonMobil Indonesia's chief executive Jon Gibbs told Reuters. ""A lot of things being said are very positive and I look forward to seeing those materialise,"" Gibbs said.Gibbs praised Indonesia's president for his recognition of the need for ""appropriate"" fiscal terms for the different geological specifications in Indonesia's of oil and gas reserves.""When you look for that equitable value for both the country and the investor, that is a key mechanism to be able to achieve that and help things to get developed,"" Gibbs said. Indonesia has struggled to attract investors to develop unconventional reserves such as the East Natuna gas field, the biggest untapped gas reserve in Asia.Exxon is partnered with Pertamina, Total and PTT Exploration and Production to develop East Natuna, but discussions over how to extract its gas, which contains high amounts of carbon dioxide, have been going on for decades.""The challenge that we have in oil and gas, going east and going deeper, with new technology -- investment is needed with demand much, much higher than supply,"" said Yanto Sianipar, a senior vice president at Chevron Indonesia.Sianipar praised the administration for opening a constructive dialogue with the industry in ""very clear words"".

247,"   By Suzanne Barlyn  A Houston-based wealth management firm must pay more than $3.8 million to a group of 19 ExxonMobil retirees who said the company mismanaged their investments and misled them about its trading strategy, according to a securities arbitration ruling.The ruling by a panel of three Financial Industry Regulatory Authority arbitrators found USCA Capital Advisors LLC liable in the case, along with its brokerage and investment advisory units, according to a ruling dated Monday. The decision includes $853,000 in punitive damages, a rare type of sanction that arbitrators impose to punish and deter improper conduct, lawyers say. The panel did not give reasons for its decision, as is customary. ""We are shocked,"" said Patrick Mendenhall, chief executive of USCA Capital Advisors.  He blamed, in part, a change to FINRA's arbitration rules that allows investors to opt for a panel that does not include an arbitrator who is affiliated with the securities industry. The arbitrators ""seemed somewhat confused"" about basic industry knowledge, Mendenhall said.

250,"  (Adds comments on Algeria)By Corina PonsCARACAS Nov 20 Venezuela would be willing to cut its own oil production if OPEC decides to limit output when it meets on Nov. 27, Foreign Minister Rafael Ramirez said on Thursday.Ramirez, who was until recently oil minister and president of state oil company PDVSA, declined to say what specific proposal Venezuela planned to take to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries meeting in Vienna.Asked which OPEC members would support a proposal aimed at strengthening prices, Ramirez said: ""I hope all of them.""Chances have risen that OPEC will agree to reduce production, according to oil industry analysts, citing delegates with the producer group.Ramirez, who serves as Venezuela's representative to the group, just returned from a trip to OPEC and non- OPEC countries Mexico, Iran, Algeria, Qatar, and Russia to shore up support. Financially strained Venezuela is pushing for higher prices to help it pay mounting arrears with private companies, debt payments and popular but pricey social programs.Although Venezuela is a founding member of OPEC, the South American country's pull has waned in recent years as production has flagged and it has shown little willingness to join in previous production cuts.On Thursday, Ramirez repeated a previous statement that the fair price of oil was $100 per barrel. Oil rose after three straight days of losses as strong U.S. economic data bolstered crude markets, though focus remained on whether OPEC will cut enough output to end a five-month long selloff.Benchmark Brent oil settled up $1.23 at $79.33 a barrel, after a session high at $79.46. EXXON ARBITRATION, ALGERIA IMPORTS Venezuela sought a revision of an arbitration award that ordered it pay Exxon Mobil Corp $1.6 billion in compensation for oil projects nationalized in 2007 because it disagrees over payment, Ramirez said.Venezuela argues a previous Exxon award from Paris-based International Chamber of Commerce for $908 million should be discounted.PDVSA has said it expects to eventually pay closer to $1 billion in the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes' (ICSID) award, which announced its decision last month.Ramirez said recent imports of Algerian crude, to dilute Venezuela's growing extra-heavy output and replace more costly naphtha purchases that had been used for the same purpose, were part of growing bilateral plans including a joint venture.""Don't view these as imports because with Algeria we're going to create a joint venture. It's like a business mixing two types of crude ... and it sells at a very good price,"" he said, adding that refineries take the mix for an extra $20 per barrel and the arrangement with Algeria could last ""forever.""

253,"  HOUSTON Nov 26 Venezuela's state-run oil company PDVSA is using the sale of its Citgo Petroleum Corp refining assets to hinder the ability of  ConocoPhillips  to collect an expected arbitration award, the U.S. oil company said in a Texas court filing.Evidence indicates PDVSA is liquidating its Citgo interests ""to remove the proceeds from the United States to Venezuela or elsewhere with the specific intent to hinder, delay or defraud its creditors,"" Conoco said on Monday in a petition for court approval to investigate that claim.Conoco's oil projects in Venezuela were nationalized by the government of president Hugo Chavez in 2007. At the end of that year U.S. firms Exxon Mobil Corp and Conoco introduced arbitration claims at several international courts.Conoco said the claim it is investigating does not ""seek to prevent a sale of Citgo or its assets for reasonable value, but to prevent the parties to the Citgo transaction from structuring the transaction to allow Citgo and its related companies to expatriate the proceeds."" PDVSA was not immediately available to comment.Bankers representing PDVSA have set a date of late December for prospective buyers to submit revised offers for Citgo Petroleum Corp despite the country's finance minister ruling out the U.S. refineries sale, according to sources. A sale of the U.S. refineries would eliminate the possibility of them being seized should a court considering such claims rule against Venezuela.According to a July 2014 Citgo bond offering, the book value of Citgo assets was $8.1 billion at the end of 2013, according to ConocoPhillips' petition, filed on Monday in a Harris County District Court. The Exxon case at a World Bank tribunal was decided in September, ruling a payment of $1.6 billion to Exxon. Experts calculate Conoco's case is at least three times larger than Exxon's because of the size and value of the assets.In a partial ruling last year, the International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) said expropriation of Conoco's assets was unlawful. A final ruling is expected for 2015, according to Venezuelan officials and Conoco.Conoco introduced a separate arbitration claim this year against PDVSA at the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC).

Trading volatility could spike since many market participants were extending the holiday. * U.S. crude futures slumped 6.5 percent to $68.93 per barrel. It was the biggest one-day drop for crude since May 2011, and brought prices to their lowest since 2010. On Thursday, OPEC decided not to cut output, which could leave oil markets heavily oversupplied.* Energy shares have been under pressure throughout 2014 as crude prices has slid almost 36 percent from a recent closing high.

261,"   By Alexandra Ulmer | CARACAS  CARACAS The World Bank's international arbitration panel will not decide this year whether to take up Venezuela's request for a revision of an award that ordered it to pay Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) in compensation for oil projects nationalized in 2007, a lawyer for the country told Reuters on Tuesday.

263,"   By Dmitry Zhdannikov, Isabel Coles and Ned Parker | LONDON/ARBIL  LONDON/ARBIL In January 2011, Exxon hired one of the best connected men in Iraq: Ali Khedery, an American of Iraqi descent who had served in Baghdad as a special assistant to five U.S. ambassadors and a senior adviser to three U.S. generals.At a meeting with Exxon a few months later to analyze Iraq's future, Khedery laid out his thoughts.Iraq under Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki was moving toward dictatorship and civil war, he said he told the session. ""We will see a rise in violence and a total paralysis in Baghdad,"" he recalled saying. Iraq was likely to align itself more closely with Iran, which will ""have an adverse impact on U.S. companies.""The gloomy scenario grabbed the attention of Exxon executives. Just two years earlier, they had signed a $25 billion deal with Iraq to develop West Qurna, one of the largest oil fields in the country. ""No one wanted to hear that they had negotiated a multi-billion dollar deal in a country which will soon implode,"" said Khedery, who has detailed to Reuters the meeting and subsequent events for the first time.He suggested an alternative: Kurdistan, a semi-autonomous region in northern Iraq that was politically stable, far from the chaos in the south, and had, by some estimates, oil reserves of 45 billion barrels.Less than a year later, Exxon signed a deal with Kurdistan. The story of how that happened explains much about the would-be nation's growing power.Interviews with key players in the secret 2011 negotiations - the talks involved not just Exxon but also fellow Western oil giant Royal Dutch Shell - show how Exxon's decision to invest infuriated both Washington and Baghdad, and helped propel Kurdistan closer to its long-held goal of independence.Kurds like to say they are the world's largest ethnic group without a state. Numbering some 35 million, they inhabit a band that stretches from Syria across southern Turkey and northern Iraq and into Iran. Most follow Sunni Islam and speak their own distinct languages.The Exxon deal fueled Kurdish self-belief. The presence of the biggest U.S. oil company has helped not just financially but also politically and even psychologically.""Part of the process of building our region has to do, of course, with dealing with oil, signing contracts, negotiations with various countries,"" Fuad Hussein, chief of staff to Kurdistan's president, told Reuters. The Exxon deal validated smaller oil deals Kurdistan had already signed and was ""a big victory for us.""Exxon declined to comment.Despite the deal, Kurdistan's path to nationhood is far from certain. Independence is opposed by Washington, Baghdad, neighboring Turkey and Iran. It also remains unclear whether the Kurds have the strength to stand alone in this volatile region. As militant group Islamic State (IS) advanced through Iraq this summer, Baghdad's troops melted away, leaving the Kurdish fighters known as peshmerga to halt the extremists. When IS threatened to take Arbil, Iraqi Kurdistan's capital, the United States bailed out the Kurds with a bombing campaign. On Tuesday, a temporary agreement between Baghdad and Arbil to end their dispute over oil exports and budget payments looked, at first glance, like Kurdistan returning to the Iraqi capital's control.But the deal does nothing to resolve the issues between Arbil and Baghdad, while forcing the Iraqi capital to effectively acknowledge Arbil's development of its energy resources with Exxon, other foreign companies and Turkey. Arbil has compromised, but it has also locked in the progress of the past three years. A CHANGE OF THINKING Oil companies have been interested in Kurdistan for years. But after the United States toppled Iraqi strongman Saddam Hussein in 2003, a series of governments in Baghdad made clear that to get a slice of the biggest prize – the huge reserves in Iraq's south – firms should not cut separate deals with the Kurds.The fear: Letting the Kurds control the oil would rob central government of billions of dollars in revenue and bring a breakup of the country closer.Western firms' reluctance began to melt after Kurdistan passed more business-friendly oil legislation in 2007. Mid-sized firms began to invest, though the biggest players remained on the sidelines.Baghdad finally divvied up the oil concessions in Iraq's south in 2009 and 2010, and oil majors rushed to sign. But terms were tough and many firms, including Exxon, were soon frustrated. Quietly, in late 2010, Exxon began putting out feelers to the Kurdish regional government. Proper talks began in early 2011, according to Hussein, the Kurdish president's chief of staff. Khedery had resigned from the U.S. administration the previous year to protest against U.S. policies in Iraq, which he thought were hurting Washington's interests in the region. In the oil world, filled with Texas oilmen and former U.S. military types, Khedery stood out. Young, rail thin and with the bearing of an academic, he appeared confident and well connected. He had been privy to many of the backroom political deals in Iraq since 2003, and had a direct channel to the president of Kurdistan.""He knew almost every official from the American side in Baghdad and he used to know every Iraqi leader,"" said Hussein, who had befriended Khedery when they worked together as advisers to the U.S. occupation authorities in Baghdad.Exxon began to rethink its approach to Kurdistan when a small group of company officials met long-time CEO Rex Tillerson and his deputies a few times in the spring of 2011.The first meeting took place at Exxon's headquarters near Dallas. The small Exxon team briefed Tillerson in his huge conference room. The oil boss listened quietly to the presentations, most of which focused on technology and geology, with a brief talk on Iraqi politics. Afterwards, most of Tillerson's questions were about politics. That's when Khedery spoke up.""I told him everything I thought would happen in Iraq,"" Khedery said. ""I said that if you want to manage risk, then the last place you want to be is in Baghdad or southern Iraq."" Those zones, he warned, were filled with Shi'ite militias, who had killed and maimed thousands of American troops, as well as ""neo-Baathist insurgents, al Qaeda sleeper cells, and Iranian Revolutionary Guards.""He pointed instead to Kurdistan, which was ""more peaceful, more predictable, and overwhelmingly pro-American.""NEAR FAILURE Serious talks with the Kurds began soon after, with a call from Khedery to Hussein, according to the presidential chief of staff. The two sides met secretly in London, Dubai and Arbil.On the Kurdish side, the main negotiator was Oil and Gas Minister Ashti Hawrami. But Kurdistan President Massoud Barzani also tapped Hussein to attend discussions. Unusually, the president even joined some meetings himself. Exxon was represented by senior executives from Texas. But it was not just Exxon and the Kurds talking. Europe's biggest oil major, Shell, was also involved, according to Hussein. Shell was Exxon's junior partner in the West Qurna field and had a separate deal with Baghdad to invest tens of billions of dollars in southern Iraq's Majnoon field. Exxon and Shell believed that teaming up – they had a combined market capitalization of more than $600 billion – would make it hard for Baghdad to throw them out of the south even if they cut a deal with Kurdistan.The first meeting was in Arbil, which is dominated by a central citadel that is one of the oldest continuously inhabited settlements in the world. The Exxon team, concerned about Kurdistan's relationship with Baghdad, and longterm stability, quizzed Barzani on his views of Iraq.""They wanted to know how my president is thinking, what is his vision,"" Hussein said. The chief of staff said Barzani called Prime Minister Maliki's policies damaging to Iraq. ""(Barzani said) that if it will continue this is bad for the country, this is dangerous, the path must be changed.""Barzani and Maliki both declined to comment. In the summer of 2011, as negotiations continued, Kurdistan sold two oil blocks to Hess, a U.S. company. Exxon and Shell had been keen to get the blocks, and the surprise sale nearly ended the talks, according to Hussein. To show Arbil was still serious, Barzani promised more attractive terms, according to both Khedery and Hussein.A signing ceremony in Arbil was planned for mid-October, but another complication arose. Shell was in the final stages of talks with Baghdad to obtain exclusive rights to process all natural gas produced in Iraq's south, a deal worth $17 billion. If Shell signed with Arbil, Baghdad might scuttle the gas deal.At a meeting with Barzani in the Imperial hotel in Vienna, where the Kurdish president was on holiday, Exxon executives said they were committed to signing. Shell's executives, though, seemed less sure.What Barzani and Exxon did not know was that Shell's CEO Peter Voser was in Baghdad, meeting Maliki to clinch the gas deal in southern Iraq. Just three days before the Kurdish deal was to be signed, Shell told Exxon it was no longer interested.A Shell spokesman declined to answer questions about the Kurdistan deal. ""Today our focus is on delivering the Basrah Gas Company project and the Majnoon Oil Field development, both of which are projects of critical importance to the reconstruction and economic development of (Iraq),"" the spokesman said. TERRITORIAL AMBITIONS? Exxon pushed ahead. The firm believed that rivals such as Chevron and Total would follow suit.The Texans kept things low key, though. An Exxon delegation flew to Arbil to sign the deal. Tillerson stayed in Dallas.The six blocks Exxon won were scattered around the autonomous region. One block was near Turkey and another near the border with Iran. The three most controversial were along the line that divides Kurdistan and the rest of Iraq, straddling areas whose control is disputed between Arbil and Baghdad. The Kurds included the blocks in the deal and later managed to bring the governor of Nineveh, one of the provinces affected, on board.To some, it looked as if Arbil was using Exxon to consolidate its borders. Hussein said Arbil already controlled the disputed territories and did not need Big Oil's legitimacy. Barzani, though, has since described the presence of companies such as Exxon as a form of insurance for Kurdistan. ""A FEW F-BOMBS"" When news of the deal leaked in early November 2011, both Baghdad and Washington were furious. Maliki wrote a letter to President Barack Obama demanding he push Exxon to scrap the deal. Iraq's deputy prime minister for energy affairs summoned Exxon executives to explain.To Washington, the deal was an embarrassment. The U.S. strategy was built on support for Maliki and its 'one Iraq' policy of a unified nation under a strong central government. Now one of America's most powerful corporations had undermined that approach.A former U.S. diplomat told Reuters the U.S. government had less than a day's notice of Exxon's deal. U.S. Ambassador to Iraq James Jeffrey was livid, said the former diplomat. ""My understanding is that (Jeffrey) dropped a few F-bombs,"" he said. ""He was less than amused.""Hussein remembers a tense meeting he and the Kurdish oil minister, Ashti Hawrami, had with Jeffrey in Baghdad soon after the deal. ""He was very angry,"" Hussein said. ""We were trying to explain that what we are doing is in the interest of Iraq, what we are doing is in the interest of Kurds, what we are doing is legal.""Hawrami declined to comment. Jeffrey has since left the State Department. He is reported to be a consultant to Exxon, but declined to comment for this story.Despite the anger, the deal was a political triumph for the Kurds. Exxon had shown Arbil could attract oil majors regardless of what Baghdad thought. Hawrami unveiled the deal at an Arbil energy conference in late 2011. Kurdistan had initially signed contracts with ""small and beautiful"" companies, he said. Now it was working with ""the giant and magnificent.""Within a few months, both Chevron and Total signed deals, further strengthening Kurdistan. A pact with Russia's Gazprom followed.""What really binds Kurdistan to Baghdad is money,"" said Robert Ford, who retired from his post as U.S. ambassador to Syria in February and previously served three stints for the State Department in Iraq. ""The more the Kurds have an independent source of income, especially from energy, the more it feeds into their desire to establish greater autonomy if not independence from Baghdad.""In January 2013, Exxon CEO Tillerson made his first and so far only visit to Iraq, traveling to Baghdad to mend fences with the central government. It isn't clear what happened in that meeting, but Baghdad has not canceled its own contract with the Texas firm. Arbil has even built a pipeline to Turkey, which makes it easier to export its oil.  The Iraqi capital remains riven by strife, but things are looking up for Exxon. The firm's main Iraqi critics – Maliki and two other senior politicians – were pushed from power this year in elections. The men who replaced them are more amenable to a compromise, as this week's agreement with Arbil shows.  Khedery, who has since set up his own consultancy, is not surprised. ""I think for Exxon,"" he said, ""with their 125 years in business, the opposition from Maliki was simply seen as something that could be managed and eventually mitigated.""

264,"  (Adds quotes, slump in crude prices)LONDON Dec 3 The sharp decline in crude oil prices will lead to a ""sorting out"" of the shale oil sector, Rex Tillerson, Exxon Mobil's CEO, said on Wednesday in a television interview.""A lot of people have entered this space -- there will be some sorting out,"" he told CNBC, when asked if the lower oil price could put pressure on smaller unconventional players in the United States.Tillerson said he was comfortable with Exxon's exposure to the sector.""We are a big investor in shale in the United States, and we have been expanding our title in the space."" The slump in the price of crude oil, which has seen Brent  fall around 38 percent since June, has prompted concern that some shale oil production will become unprofitable, and may lead to problems for some players in the sector.He said that the reason for the price fall was due to the fundamentals of growing supply and limited demand growth. ""If you take a 1.6 million barrel per day supply growth and put it on top of a 1 million bpd demand growth, you've got a surplus of capacity,"" he said.""You fill storage up, you fill inventories up, at some point it's got to show up in prices."" Tillerson said that he was confident with the company's ability to withstand the price drop.""All the investment decisions we take have been tested across a range of pricing that accommodates these kinds of price swings,"" he said. ""You ensure that you can invest and be successful at the bottom of the cycle.""""We test across a range that's all the way down to $40, and up to $120.""

266,"   By Dmitry Zhdannikov, Isabel Coles and Ned Parker | LONDON/ARBIL  LONDON/ARBIL In January 2011, Exxon hired one of the best connected men in Iraq: Ali Khedery, an American of Iraqi descent who had served in Baghdad as a special assistant to five U.S. ambassadors and a senior adviser to three U.S. generals.At a meeting with Exxon a few months later to analyze Iraq's future, Khedery laid out his thoughts.Iraq under Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki was moving toward dictatorship and civil war, he said he told the session. ""We will see a rise in violence and a total paralysis in Baghdad,"" he recalled saying. Iraq was likely to align itself more closely with Iran, which will ""have an adverse impact on U.S. companies.""The gloomy scenario grabbed the attention of Exxon executives. Just two years earlier, they had signed a $25 billion deal with Iraq to develop West Qurna, one of the largest oil fields in the country. ""No one wanted to hear that they had negotiated a multi-billion dollar deal in a country which will soon implode,"" said Khedery, who has detailed to Reuters the meeting and subsequent events for the first time.He suggested an alternative: Kurdistan, a semi-autonomous region in northern Iraq that was politically stable, far from the chaos in the south, and had, by some estimates, oil reserves of 45 billion barrels.Less than a year later, Exxon signed a deal with Kurdistan. The story of how that happened explains much about the would-be nation's growing power.Interviews with key players in the secret 2011 negotiations - the talks involved not just Exxon but also fellow Western oil giant Royal Dutch Shell - show how Exxon's decision to invest infuriated both Washington and Baghdad, and helped propel Kurdistan closer to its long-held goal of independence.Kurds like to say they are the world's largest ethnic group without a state. Numbering some 35 million, they inhabit a band that stretches from Syria across southern Turkey and northern Iraq and into Iran. Most follow Sunni Islam and speak their own distinct languages.The Exxon deal fueled Kurdish self-belief. The presence of the biggest U.S. oil company has helped not just financially but also politically and even psychologically.""Part of the process of building our region has to do, of course, with dealing with oil, signing contracts, negotiations with various countries,"" Fuad Hussein, chief of staff to Kurdistan's president, told Reuters. The Exxon deal validated smaller oil deals Kurdistan had already signed and was ""a big victory for us.""Exxon declined to comment.Despite the deal, Kurdistan's path to nationhood is far from certain. Independence is opposed by Washington, Baghdad, neighboring Turkey and ran. It also remains unclear whether the Kurds have the strength to stand alone in this volatile region. As militant group Islamic State (IS) advanced through Iraq this summer, Baghdad's troops melted away, leaving the Kurdish fighters known as peshmerga to halt the extremists. When IS threatened to take Arbil, Iraqi Kurdistan's capital, the United States bailed out the Kurds with a bombing campaign. On Tuesday, a temporary agreement between Baghdad and Arbil to end their dispute over oil exports and budget payments looked, at first glance, like Kurdistan returning to the Iraqi capital's control.But the deal does nothing to resolve the issues between Arbil and Baghdad, while forcing the Iraqi capital to effectively acknowledge Arbil's development of its energy resources with Exxon, other foreign companies and Turkey. Arbil has compromised, but it has also locked in the progress of the past three years. <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^See this story in PDF reut.rs/1ttNmWbSPECIAL REPORT - How Mosul fell: An Iraqi general disputes Baghdad's story (PDF) reut.rs/1s5vdkpSPECIAL REPORT - Wheat warfare: Islamic State uses wheat to tighten grip in Iraq (PDF) reut.rs/1qJQP0jSPECIAL REPORT - The doubt at the heart of Iraq's Sunni ""revolution"" (PDF) reut.rs/1nJxsYFSPECIAL REPORT - Maliki and the limits of U.S. power (PDF) here:MALIKI.pdfSPECIAL REPORT - Iraqi forces, images testify to atrocities (PDF) here    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>A CHANGE OF THINKING  Oil companies have been interested in Kurdistan for years. But after the United States toppled Iraqi strongman Saddam Hussein in 2003, a series of governments in Baghdad made clear that to get a slice of the biggest prize – the huge reserves in Iraq's south – firms should not cut separate deals with the Kurds.The fear: Letting the Kurds control the oil would rob central government of billions of dollars in revenue and bring a breakup of the country closer.Western firms' reluctance began to melt after Kurdistan passed more business-friendly oil legislation in 2007. Mid-sized firms began to invest, though the biggest players remained on the sidelines.Baghdad finally divvied up the oil concessions in Iraq's south in 2009 and 2010, and oil majors rushed to sign. But terms were tough and many firms, including Exxon, were soon frustrated.Quietly, in late 2010, Exxon began putting out feelers to the Kurdish regional government. Proper talks began in early 2011, according to Hussein, the Kurdish president's chief of staff. Khedery had resigned from the U.S. administration the previous year to protest against U.S. policies in Iraq, which he thought were hurting Washington's interests in the region. In the oil world, filled with Texas oilmen and former U.S. military types, Khedery stood out. Young, rail thin and with the bearing of an academic, he appeared confident and well connected. He had been privy to many of the backroom political deals in Iraq since 2003, and had a direct channel to the president of Kurdistan.""He knew almost every official from the American side in Baghdad and he used to know every Iraqi leader,"" said Hussein, who had befriended Khedery when they worked together as advisers to the U.S. occupation authorities in Baghdad.Exxon began to rethink its approach to Kurdistan when a small group of company officials met long-time CEO Rex Tillerson and his deputies a few times in the spring of 2011.The first meeting took place at Exxon's headquarters near Dallas. The small Exxon team briefed Tillerson in his huge conference room. The oil boss listened quietly to the presentations, most of which focused on technology and geology, with a brief talk on Iraqi politics. Afterwards, most of Tillerson's questions were about politics. That's when Khedery spoke up.""I told him everything I thought would happen in Iraq,"" Khedery said. ""I said that if you want to manage risk, then the last place you want to be is in Baghdad or southern Iraq."" Those zones, he warned, were filled with Shi'ite militias, who had killed and maimed thousands of American troops, as well as ""neo-Baathist insurgents, al Qaeda sleeper cells, and Iranian Revolutionary Guards.""He pointed instead to Kurdistan, which was ""more peaceful, more predictable, and overwhelmingly pro-American."" NEAR FAILURE Serious talks with the Kurds began soon after, with a call from Khedery to Hussein, according to the presidential chief of staff. The two sides met secretly in London, Dubai and Arbil.On the Kurdish side, the main negotiator was Oil and Gas Minister Ashti Hawrami. But Kurdistan President Massoud Barzani also tapped Hussein to attend discussions. Unusually, the president even joined some meetings himself. Exxon was represented by senior executives from Texas.But it was not just Exxon and the Kurds talking. Europe's biggest oil major, Shell, was also involved, according to Hussein. Shell was Exxon's junior partner in the West Qurna field and had a separate deal with Baghdad to invest tens of billions of dollars in southern Iraq's Majnoon field. Exxon and Shell believed that teaming up – they had a combined market capitalization of more than $600 billion – would make it hard for Baghdad to throw them out of the south even if they cut a deal with Kurdistan.The first meeting was in Arbil, which is dominated by a central citadel that is one of the oldest continuously inhabited settlements in the world. The Exxon team, concerned about Kurdistan's relationship with Baghdad, and longterm stability, quizzed Barzani on his views of Iraq.""They wanted to know how my president is thinking, what is his vision,"" Hussein said. The chief of staff said Barzani called Prime Minister Maliki's policies damaging to Iraq. ""(Barzani said) that if it will continue this is bad for the country, this is dangerous, the path must be changed.""Barzani and Maliki both declined to comment. In the summer of 2011, as negotiations continued, Kurdistan sold two oil blocks to Hess, a U.S. company. Exxon and Shell had been keen to get the blocks, and the surprise sale nearly ended the talks, according to Hussein. To show Arbil was still serious, Barzani promised more attractive terms, according to both Khedery and Hussein.A signing ceremony in Arbil was planned for mid-October, but another complication arose. Shell was in the final stages of talks with Baghdad to obtain exclusive rights to process all natural gas produced in Iraq's south, a deal worth $17 billion. If Shell signed with Arbil, Baghdad might scuttle the gas deal.At a meeting with Barzani in the Imperial hotel in Vienna, where the Kurdish president was on holiday, Exxon executives said they were committed to signing. Shell's executives, though, seemed less sure.What Barzani and Exxon did not know was that Shell's CEO Peter Voser was in Baghdad, meeting Maliki to clinch the gas deal in southern Iraq. Just three days before the Kurdish deal was to be signed, Shell told Exxon it was no longer interested. A Shell spokesman declined to answer questions about the Kurdistan deal. ""Today our focus is on delivering the Basrah Gas Company project and the Majnoon Oil Field development, both of which are projects of critical importance to the reconstruction and economic development of (Iraq),"" the spokesman said.TERRITORIAL AMBITIONS? Exxon pushed ahead. The firm believed that rivals such as Chevron and Total would follow suit.The Texans kept things low key, though. An Exxon delegation flew to Arbil to sign the deal. Tillerson stayed in Dallas.The six blocks Exxon won were scattered around the autonomous region. One block was near Turkey and another near the border with Iran. The three most controversial were along the line that divides Kurdistan and the rest of Iraq, straddling areas whose control is disputed between Arbil and Baghdad. The Kurds included the blocks in the deal and later managed to bring the governor of Nineveh, one of the provinces affected, on board.To some, it looked as if Arbil was using Exxon to consolidate its borders. Hussein said Arbil already controlled the disputed territories and did not need Big Oil's legitimacy.

269,"  HOUSTON Dec 9 Global energy demand should rise some 35 percent through 2040 as the middle class expands in developing countries and supplies shift to lower-carbon fuels that may allow for lower emissions, Exxon Mobil Corp  said on Tuesday in its annual outlook.Exxon, the world's largest publicly traded oil company, said that without efficiency and technology gains overall energy demand would grow by 140 percent.Though the global population is expected to rise to about 9 billion in 2040 from around 7 billion currently, energy demand and emissions are already starting to fall in developed countries thanks to greater efficiency, the company said.That points to slower growth in emissions and an eventual leveling off overall.""We expect global energy-related CO2 emissions will rise by about 25 percent from 2010 to 2030 and then decline approximately 5 percent to 2040,"" the company said. While that 25 percent rise is considered significant, it would be about half the level of emissions growth seen from 1980 to 2010.Exxon said alternative power sources should grow sharply, with solar capacity forecast to jump more than 20 times from 2010 to 2040, and wind power to expand almost five times. Nuclear is expected to grow about 90 percent, led by India and China.

271,"   By Wilda Asmarini | JAKARTA  JAKARTA Dec 9 Spending in Indonesia on oil and gas exploration and production could fall by 20 percent in 2015 as a slide in global prices makes some projects no longer viable, its top industry association said on Tuesday.Declining energy investment could weigh on newly appointed President Joko Widodo's economic growth target of 7 percent in 2015, which is underpinned by new investment in oil and gas. The sector is the biggest contributor to state revenue at about 12 percent this year.Widodo has ordered sweeping reforms in efforts to wipe out corruption and encourage investment in energy. The former OPEC member has become a top crude importer and aims to avert future fuel shortages.""We estimate oil and gas companies' capex will decline 20 percent next year,"" Lukman Mahfoedz, a director at the Indonesia Petroleum Association (IPA), told reporters.Realized investment in Indonesia's upstream oil and gas sector is expected to fall below a target of around $32 billion this year, because many projects have been delayed, Mahfoedz said. Brent crude oil has plummeted 43 percent since June, reaching a five-year low below $66 a barrel on Tuesday after sliding for a sixth consecutive session on signs of a growing supply glut.Indonesia needs to triple the current level of energy exploration to avoid future shortages in supply, but meeting that goal will be ""very difficult now"", Mahfoedz said. The government hopes crude oil output will reach 900,000 barrels per day (bpd) in 2015, the regulator said last month, up from an estimated 794,000 bpd this year.With oil prices below $70 per barrel, however, some projects are no longer economically viable, said Mahfoedz, who is also the chief executive of Indonesia's largest listed energy company, Medco Energi Internasional.Mahfoedz stopped short of naming which projects might be put on hold. The association fully supports Widodo's efforts to end corruption in the sector, newly appointed IPA President Craig Stewart said, adding that there were around 300 oil and gas production-sharing contracts in Indonesia with varying cost structures and at various stages of development.Most international oil companies have major investments in Indonesia including Chevron Corp, Exxon Mobil Corp , BP and Total.Firms are looking at their break-even price to maintain production from older wells, which may need high levels of capital spending, Stewart said.When asked whether projects in Indonesia are still viable, Stewart said, ""For some mega projects and the cost in today's price, no.

273,"   By Mike Stone and Jessica Resnick-Ault  Citgo Petroleum Corp, Venezuela's U.S. oil refining unit, has received revised bids from at least four bidders, some which have valued the company at more than $10 billion, according to three people familiar with the matter.Pricing at the top range of bids and tumbling oil prices could make the cash-strapped Venezuelan government less ambiguous towards divesting Citgo. An Oct. 26 El Universal newspaper interview with Venezuelan Finance Minister Rodolfo Marco in which he said Citgo's sale ""has been ruled out"" stirred confusion among interested parties. The companies that made bids in December include Marathon Petroleum Corp (MPC.N), Valero Energy Corp (VLO.N), HollyFrontier Corp (HFC.N) and a consortium of TPG Capital LP and Riverstone Holdings LLC, the people familiar with the matter said. They asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential.They said some bids came in at more than $10 billion while others were below $7 billion. Bidders have taken different views on the fluctuating value of crude oil held at the refineries, future crude oil purchases from OPEC member Venezuela and potential environmental liabilities, the people said.Citgo declined to comment.  Citgo runs three refineries in the United States with a total capacity of 750,000 barrels per day. The party that acquires all of them would have major refining capacity in the U.S. Midwest and on the Gulf Coast, benefiting from a boom in U.S. oil production.Lazard Ltd (LAZ.N), the investment bank hired by Venezuela's state-run PDVSA to explore a sale of Citgo, has not told bidders if there will be an additional round of bids, the people familiar with the matter said. Representatives for Lazard, PDVSA, Marathon Petroleum and HollyFrontier did not return requests for comment. Representatives for TPG, Valero and Riverstone declined to comment. A first round of bids this fall attracted other contenders including India's Reliance Industries Ltd (RELI.NS) and PBF Energy Inc (PBF.N). Those parties are no longer in the running, the people said.Venezuela faces a string of international arbitration cases as a result of nationalizations under the late President Hugo Chavez's socialist government. A sale of the U.S. refineries would eliminate the possibility of them being seized should a court rule against Venezuela. ConocoPhillips (COP.N) said last month in a Texas court filing that the Venezuelan government is using the sale of Citgo to hinder ConocoPhillips' ability to collect an expected arbitration award after its oil assets were nationalized in Venezuela in 2007. Citgo pays out hefty dividends to its owner, state-owned oil company PDVSA. Lower oil prices are adding to Venezuela's debt woes because they weigh on the revenue it generates from oil production, making it more open to raising cash via a sale of Citgo.Citgo's U.S. refineries are in Lemont, Illinois; Lake Charles, Louisiana; and Corpus Christi, Texas. Citgo also has 48 oil terminals. PDVSA also has a 50 percent stake in the Chalmette refinery in Louisiana alongside Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N), which owns the rest.

277,"  (The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.)By Amy FeldmanNEW YORK, Dec 22 - In the few days left between now and year-end, when you're buying last-minute holiday gifts and making New Year's plans, you'll want to review your investment portfolio and figure out what to sell.Consider it a way to get an extra little gift for yourself going into 2015.It has been such a great year overall for the stock market - the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index is up more than 11 percent for the year through December 19 - you might not think there's any point in looking for losers to sell for tax purposes. But not every stock or fund is up this year, and it's likely you've got at least one clunker in your portfolio. Maybe you bought shares of Exxon Mobil Corp last summer at $104, and watched them fall 13 percent to a recent $91 as oil prices tanked. Or maybe you purchased Pimco Total Return Fund  a few years ago, when manager Bill Gross was considered the bond king, and didn't sell as the fund's performance faltered.While investors don't like to take losses, studies show that selling losing investments to off-set gains for tax purposes - called tax-loss harvesting - adds to returns, particularly when done throughout the year. While so much of investing is subject to the whims of the market, this is a little piece that's in your control. At tax time, you'll match the losses against the gains. Then, if the result after that matching is a net loss, you can take an additional $3,000 to offset your ordinary income - and carry forward any remaining loss to future tax years.""Sometimes people don't want to face the reality that they have a big loss, but you're not doing yourself a favor by overlooking it,"" says Joseph Perry, partner in charge of tax services at Marcum. This year, such tax-loss harvesting may be especially important. After all, given the market's rise, you probably do have gains. And even if you have not sold any winning investments, if you've invested in mutual funds, you've got capital gains distributions so you'll owe capital-gains tax. Given the market's rise this year that may be higher than you'd expected.Consider: Some mutual funds this year have announced distributions of more than 10 percent of assets, including T. Rowe Price Global Technology and Vanguard Mid-Cap Growth. If you have $10,000 in a fund that distributes 10 percent of assets, that's a gain of $1,000. At the 15 percent long-term capital gains rate, you'd owe $150 in tax - unless you offset it with an equivalent $1,000 loss.""If you are looking at your portfolio without  the mutual fund distributions you might be missing something,"" says Perry. ""I'm not sure people are focused on that, and it appears that this year there are more distributions than in the past.""An additional tip: If you're selling for a loss, pay attention to the so-called wash-sale rule, the tricky Internal Revenue Service regulation that prohibits you from taking an investment loss if you buy new shares 30 days before the sale or 30 days after it.

278,"  RIO DE JANEIRO Jan 8 Brazil's state-run oil company said on Thursday it produced more crude oil and related liquids in the third quarter than Exxon Mobil Corp, making Petroleo Brasileiro SA the world's largest publicly traded petroleum producer for the first time.Petrobras, based in Rio de Janeiro, produced 2.209 million barrels of oil and other liquids (bpd) a day in Brazil and abroad in the three months ending Sept. 30, according to the company's Web site.That output was 7 percent more than the 2.065 million bpd Exxon produced in the same quarter, according to the Exxon Mobil website. When natural gas output is included, though, Exxon Mobil remained the world's largest investor-owned producer of hydrocarbons.The Petrobras record is one of the few bright spots for a company embroiled in a multibillion-dollar corruption scandal that has delayed release of its third-quarter results, put it at risk of breaking debt covenants and shut it out of capital markets. Still, production was 28 percent less than the 2014 output the Petrobras five-year plan had promised in 2010.Petrobras has spent heavily to achieve recent production increases after several years of stagnation and more than a decade of missed targets. In achieving the new production record, Petrobras has also become the world's most-indebted and least-profitable major oil company. Its $221 billion five-year investment plan is among the most expensive in world history and may have to be curtailed in the wake of the scandal. Brazilian police and prosecutors have accused company executives of conspiring with contractors to inflate the value of contracts and kick back some of the excess to executives, politicians and political parties. Petrobras has seen its market value plummet from nearly $300 billion in 2008 to about $40 billion today. Exxon Mobil is worth $384 billion, the most valuable oil company in the world.While Petrobras is owned by the Brazilian government, most of its stock is owned by non-government investors and its shares trade in Sao Paulo and New York.When natural gas production is figured in, Irvine, Texas-based Exxon Mobil produced 3.831 million barrels of oil and equivalent natural gas per day (boepd) in the third quarter, 49 percent more than Petrobras' 2.746 million boepd in the same period.

Environmental Assessment Office.WCC LNG, co-owned by Exxon and its majority-owned Imperial Oil unit, is one of 18 LNG projects proposed for northern British Columbia to supply gas to Asian buyers, including rival ones led by Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Malaysia's Petronas. However high costs and uncertain economics due to falling oil prices  have slowed development in the region, with Petronas in December delaying a final investment decision on its $11 billion Pacific NorthWest LNG project while it looks for cost savings. Imperial, Canada's No.2 integrated oil and gas producer, said it expects to receive all needed regulatory approvals for the project by 2017. After those are in hand, the two companies will decide on whether to build the facility.""We're looking at an in-service date beyond 2023,"" said Pius Rolheiser, a spokesman for Imperial.

280,"   By Jarrett Renshaw | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Exxon Mobil Corp's new joint-venture oil-by-rail terminal in Canada, set to be the nation's largest, will begin shipping crude directly to its own refineries in Illinois and Louisiana by March, another reminder that pipeline delays are not stopping the rise in oil sands exports.Production from the company's Kearl field project is expected to ramp up later this year, when Exxon would hope to move the crude via pipeline, including the controversial Keystone XL pipeline.But delays led Exxon's Canadian subsidiary Imperial Oil Ltd and pipeline giant Kinder Morgan Inc to announce plans a year ago to build the rail terminal in Edmonton, Canada. In August, they said they would expand capacity to 235,000-barrel-per-day, with first shipments from the $232 million terminal this quarter. But they had not detailed who would buy the oil.Previously unreported federal documents reviewed by Reuters reveal two of the prime buyers: Exxon's 238,000-bpd refinery in Joliet, Illinois and its 502,500-bpd refinery in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, both aided by major new offloading rail terminals.In papers filed with the U.S. Surface Transportation Board in December, logistics firm CenterPoint Properties said ExxonMobil would send crude through a newly constructed rail terminal owned by its unit Joliet Bulk, Barge & Rail LLC.Trains run by Canadian National will be unloaded at the facility and sent via a 210,000-bpd pipeline to the ExxonMobil refinery in Joliet, four miles (6.4 km) away, the filing said. CenterPoint, of Oak Brook, Illinois, declined to comment. A different facility, being built by Genesis Energy LP, will allow Exxon to bring the crude to its Baton Rouge plant, the third largest in the United States, where it could be used to replace imports from Saudi Arabia, Chad or Mexico.ExxonMobil spokesman Todd Spitler said that the company also plans to bring the crude to Baton Rouge port. Spitler did not say where the crude at the port would eventually head, but it could be re-exported or sent to other U.S. refineries. The new terminals will allow ExxonMobil and Imperial Oil to start moving more quantities of sand-oil out of their multibillion-dollar joint project in Kearl, Canada. Delays on pipelines, including the Keystone XL, have forced the companies to pursue rail transportation. MORE FOR CANADA ExxonMobil has already upgraded its Joliet refinery to run the heavy Canadian crude. The refinery receives roughly 65,000-bpd of crude imported from Canada in recent years, the majority of which is heavy sour, according to U.S. data. The Canadian crude will also be sent to a rail terminal owned and operated by Genesis in Port Hudson, Louisiana. The terminal, dubbed Scenic Station, is connected to a pipeline that runs to the ExxonMobil refinery complex.ExxonMobil will be given preferential treatment, but does not have exclusive rights to the terminal, Spitler said.He said the Genesis terminal project will expand the refinery’s access to a wider slate of feedstock, which EIA data shows currently consists mostly of medium to heavy crudes, including large imports from Saudi Arabia and Africa. “This project helps us ensure the refinery stays connected to the best available supply sources and will benefit from logistics flexibility for North American crudes,” Spitler said. “Some Canadian oil will be transported into the rail terminal and port facility.” (Reporting By Jarrett Renshaw; Editing by Tom Brown)",2015-01-15,XOM,"Thu Jan 15, 2015 | 10:53am EST",Exxon's new oil-by-rail terminal in Canada gears up for U.S. shipments,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-crude-rail-exxon-mobil-idUSKBN0KO1W620150115?type=companyNews
281,"  (Refiling to delete extraneous letter in the first paragraph)By Gayatri Suroyo and Eveline DanubrataJAKARTA Jan 16 Indonesia has scrapped a land tax that companies pay while exploring for oil and gas, a move that might encourage exploration at a time of concern that it could fall sharply due to tumbling oil prices.According to a ministerial decree posted on the Finance Ministry's website, the tax office is no longer assessing a 0.5 percent ""land and building tax"" charged on the area in which companies are carrying out exploration activities, effective from Jan. 1.Wahju Tumakaka, spokesman for the ministry's tax office, said the interpretation used for taxing exploration areas was wrong, thus the ministry amended the regulation.The tax ""is supposed to be applied for those using Indonesian land. In terms of the oil and gas sector, it should only be applied during production stage,"" Tumakaka told Reuters. He said that in 2014, the land and building tax from oil and gas exploration and production work brought in about 18 trillion rupiah ($1.43 billion), or 1.2 percent of total government revenue.  No breakdown of what percentage came from just oil exploration was available.In December, the Indonesian Petroleum Association said that spending on oil and gas exploration and production in the country could fall by up to 20 percent this year. FORMER OPEC MEMBER Indonesia, a former OPEC member, was self-sufficient in oil for decades, but is now a net importer. Output in the Southeast Asian nation has declined since a 1995 peak, and is projected to fall to 700,000 barrels a day (bpd) in 2019 from an estimated 849,000 bpd this year.To attract more investment, the energy ministry has been asking for tax incentives for exploration for several years.An analyst who follows the oil industry said the tax change is ""quite important"" and could encourage companies to invest more in exploration.Among oil companies, the tax was ""their number one gripe, it's the first thing they wanted to change,"" he said, adding that it was positive that the government is listening to the industry and being ""more investor friendly"".Oil and gas companies operating in Indonesia include Chevron Corp, Exxon Mobil Corp, ConocoPhillips, and state-owned Pertamina.

289,"   By Denis Pinchuk and Katya Golubkova | MOSCOW  MOSCOW Russian state-controlled oil company Rosneft (ROSN.MM) will not be able to resume drilling in the Kara Sea this year after Western sanctions halted its cooperation with ExxonMobil (XOM.N) in a major setback for Moscow's energy ambitions, two company sources said.The delay will be a blow to Rosneft, which was spearheading President Vladimir Putin's goal to increase output and secure Russia's energy dominance by exploring the Arctic, where Moscow is believed to have one of the world's largest oil resources.In September, Rosneft announced it had found oil in the Kara Sea after drilling with Exxon at the Universitetskaya-1 well, the most northerly in the world. Oil resources in the Kara Sea are estimated to be comparable to those of Saudi Arabia.The company was due to restart drilling this year but Exxon was forced to stop cooperation after the West imposed sanctions on Russia over its actions in the Ukraine crisis.""There will be no drilling in 2015. There is no platform and it is too late to get one. The project was initially created for Exxon's platform,"" a Rosneft source said. The second source confirmed this. Asked for comment, Rosneft said: ""In 2015, Rosneft will ensure implementation of its license obligations related to geological exploration in the Kara Sea."" Usually licenses give companies a certain period of time to complete work. Rosneft did not give the timeframe offered by the license. The second Rosneft source said the company planned to resume drilling in 2016 but that commercial production would now be pushed back to beyond 2020.""Usually, it takes 8-10 years from the first well to the first oil on the offshore but here you have such a difficult situation,"" the source said.Russia is the world's top oil producing nation and output hit a post-Soviet high of an average 10.58 million barrels per day (bpd) last year. But the country needs to explore new areas such as the Arctic or for shale oil because its resources in Western Siberia, Russia's main oil producing region, are depleting.  PLATFORM SEARCH      Rosneft was using the West Alpha platform, owned by Seadrill subsidiary North Atlantic Drilling (NADL.N), in the Kara Sea.The rig returned to Norway in mid-October after completing the well in the Kara Sea in late September. The rig is on contract with Exxon until July 2016.  Due to severe weather conditions, drilling in the Kara Sea can only be conducted during a couple of months a year. The Universitetskaya-1 well is Russia's second offshore Arctic project after Prirazlomnoye operated by Gazprom Neft (SIBN.MM).The first source said roughly a year and a half was needed to adjust the Kara Sea project for a new platform so in order to start drilling in July-August next year, Rosneft would need to start looking for a platform now. ""We expect to decide on the platform by April-May and will launch the tender soon. The choice is obvious -- there are a lot of platforms in the East, in China or South Korea, maybe from North Atlantic Drilling, maybe from Lukoil (LKOH.MM) in the Baltics,"" he said. ""There are a lot of platforms and this is not a problem even if it is not an ice-proof -- it can always be upgraded ... After oil prices have fallen it is two-times cheaper to lease platforms and supply vessels.""Western sanctions prevent Western firms from helping certain Russian companies, including Rosneft, to explore in the Arctic, in deep water or for shale oil, among other restrictions. Valery Nesterov, an analyst with Sberbank CIB, said the main challenge would not be to find a proper platform but to address the safety of operations in an area where Russia lacks expertise.

304,"   By Erwin Seba | HOUSTON  HOUSTON Exxon Mobil Corp's (XOM.N) push to persuade workers at its Beaumont, Texas refinery to sign a five-year contract, nearly twice as long as the last one, is part of an effort to avert labor stoppages during a possible expansion that could make it the largest such plant in the United States, sources familiar with refinery operations said.In a bid to win support, the company has offered a $4,500 bonus to hourly workers represented by the United Steelworkers union, which normally only signs three-year deals in the refining industry, the sources said.A longer-term contract, the sources said, would allow the company to avert walkouts if it decides to proceed with a building project that would take until 2020 to complete. It might also weaken the local's hand in future talks, they added.As Reuters reported in July, before crude prices plunged, Exxon is evaluating a multibillion-dollar expansion to lift the refinery’s processing capacity to between 500,000 and 800,000 barrels per day from 344,600 bpd now.The centerpiece of the plan, which would bolster the U.S. Gulf Coast's position as a top global supplier of gasoline and diesel, would be the addition of a third crude distillation unit.""They’re talking about spending all this money for an expansion at Beaumont,"" said one of the sources. ""They don’t want the opportunity for a strike.""A spokesman for Exxon, which often tells investors it takes a long-term view in a cyclical business, said stability is the goal of the five-year contract.""Beaumont is negotiating with (USW) Local 13-243 to pursue a longer-term, off-pattern contract that will provide enhanced stability,"" said Exxon spokesman Todd Spitler. ""We believe a long-term agreement will maintain Exxon Mobil's ability to compete in a range of economic conditions."" Acceptance of the proposal would leave the USW Beaumont local out of sync with the union’s national bargaining program for refinery workers. That means Beaumont workers might lose some of the leverage they have with the world's largest publicly traded oil company because they would no longer be able to negotiate as part of a nationwide bloc.""The cost if they lose is Exxon will handle them the way it wants to handle them,"" said one of the sources.Since talks started several weeks ago, union leaders have rejected offers made by Exxon Beaumont, according to messages sent to refinery workers by the company.Local union leaders in Beaumont declined to discuss the negotiations with Exxon. PREVIOUS BUILDOUTS $4-$10 BILLION In addition to the five-year length, Exxon's ""last, best and final"" contract proposal, made on Jan. 31, includes annual wage increases equal to those that could be agreed to by the USW and U.S. refiners in current contract talks and again in 2018.The offer contains a $4,500 ratification bonus on top of the bonus that could be won at the other USW-represented Exxon plants.It also includes a 75-day notice before the union can go on strike or the company can lock out workers that can only be exercised after the contract expires. Most contracts only require a 24-hour notice of a strike or lockout after a contract expires, according to messages sent to workers and posted on an Exxon web site.A price tag hasn't been placed on the possible Beaumont expansion. The cost will depend on the choice and size of the units Exxon builds if it goes ahead with the project.Expansions with the addition of a crude unit at Gulf Coast refineries in the past 10 years have cost between $4 billion and $10 billon and took between four and five years to complete.    Workers at the Beaumont refinery are working on 24-hour rolling extensions after their contract expired on Feb. 1.Beaumont has not been affected by walkouts, some now in their 12th day, that were called at 11 refineries and chemical plants to push for a new, three-year nationwide refinery pact.Talks between and industry negotiator Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) and the USW, which represents the striking workers and those at 52 other U.S. plants, have so far failed to produce an accord.

Combined, the closings took roughly 15 percent of the state's refining capacity offline.February-delivery CARBOB gasoline traded as high as 44 cents a gallon over March RBOB futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange, up 10 cents from the previous day’s close in heavy trading, market sources said. That was the highest level since September 2013.

The catalytic cracker is the most important gasoline producing unit at the Torrance refinery.  Traders had expected prices for CARBOB to rise throughout the day as more information about the incident came out.

307,"   By Nichola Groom | TORRANCE, Calif.  TORRANCE, Calif. An explosion and fire ripped through a gasoline processing unit at an Exxon Mobil refinery in Torrance, California, near Los Angeles on Wednesday, slightly injuring four workers and shattering windows of surrounding buildings, authorities said.Investigators were trying to determine the cause of the blast, which occurred shortly before 9 a.m. PST (12 p.m. ET), but there was no evidence of foul play, according to Torrance Fire Captain Steve Deuel.Deuel said a small ground fire following the explosion was quickly extinguished. Firefighters and refinery crews also contained a gasoline leak caused by the blast, he said.""All personnel have been accounted for,"" Exxon Mobil said in a statement. ""Four contractors have been taken to Long Beach Medical Center for evaluation for minor injuries."" Torrance Mayor Patrick Furey told local television station KNBC in an interview that people who live near the refinery should take precautions.""The most important thing is to shelter in place, stay indoors, no outdoor activity, turn the air conditioners off, keep the windows closed,"" Furey told the station.A structure at the refinery was visibly damaged, with smoke smoldering from twisted metal, and the air near the blast site smelled of sulfur and chemicals.The South Coast Air Quality Management District dispatched inspectors to take air samples for analysis “as quickly as possible,” said agency spokesman Sam Atwood.The agency issued a health advisory urging children, the elderly or individuals with respiratory or heart conditions to stay indoors if they can see or smell smoke and for otherwise healthy people to avoid strenuous activity outdoors if they can see or smell smoke. The California Department of Industrial Relations opened a probe into the blast, agency spokeswoman Julia Bernstein said. The workplace safety agency issued an order forbidding Exxon Mobil from operating the 100,000-barrel-per-day fluid catalytic cracker - a central gasoline-producing unit - until the investigation is complete, Bernstein said. The department said the shutdown of the unit could last up to six months. The refinery has a capacity of 155,000 barrels per day, according to Exxon Mobil.Gasoline in Los Angeles surged to the highest level in about 18 months after the explosion on fears that local supply will tighten in the weeks ahead. The surge could translate to higher pump prices just as Californians and other U.S. motorists are benefiting from the slump in crude oil prices.The fluid catalytic cracker is the facility’s main gasoline producing unit. Tesoro Corp recently shut its nearby 240,000-barrel-per-day refinery in Martinez after United Steelworkers union members walked out. The two events sent February deliveries of California gasoline, known as CARBOB, as high as 40 cents above futures. On the New York Stock Exchange, Tesoro shares rose 5 percent to close at $87.09. The company has three California refineries and may benefit from the incident. Exxon Mobil's shares closed down 2.2 percent at $91.01 on the NYSE.  LIKE AN EARTHQUAKE Cory Milsap, an electrical contractor at the plant, said many workers were sent home after the explosion. The refinery occupies 750 acres (300 hectares) and has 650 employees and 550 contractors.“All I heard was a loud sound. ... “All I saw was smoke and people running, so I made sure I got out of there,” Milsap said.Giselle Monreal, a neighbor who lives across the street from the facility, said the blast shook the ground like an earthquake, knocking a 52 inch (132-cm) flat-screen television off its stand onto a coffee table and shattering a window in her garage.Torrance is a residential suburb about 20 miles (30 km) south of Los Angeles. Toyota Motor Corp and Honda Motor Co Ltd have their North American operations bases there.The city had a population of more than 147,000 in 2013, according to a U.S. Census Bureau estimate. Surrounding areas were not evacuated, but nearby schools kept students and staff indoors immediately after the explosion as a precaution, Fire Captain Deuel said. Students at 14 schools near the refinery were ordered to shelter in place because of concerns over air quality, Torrance Unified School District spokeswoman Tammy Khan told Reuters.Exxon was also looking into the cause of the explosion, according to Gesuina Paras, a public and government affairs adviser at the company.Trade publication OPIS, citing an unidentified source, reported that an electrostatic precipitator (ESP), which reduces fluid catalytic cracker particulates, exploded as contract workers were doing maintenance on the nearby fluid catalytic cracking unit, or FCC.""Contractors working on the FCC to fix the expanders,"" the source said, adding that an injection of ammonia on top of the flue gas stream caused a pressure buildup, which resulted in the ESP unit explosion.The unit could take up to a year to replace, the source said.The incident came after the United Steelworkers walked out of 11 facilities, including nine refineries accounting for 13 percent of U.S. production capacity, after negotiations on a national contract stalled on Feb. 1. One of the central issues, according to the union, is employee safety.Torrance has not been involved in the walkouts.

Also, Berkshire Hathaway  disclosed shedding a $3.74 billion investment in Exxon.The S&P 500 was down 1.5 percent, with U.S. crude oil falling 2.6 percent to settle at $52.14 a barrel. Fed policymakers expressed concern last month that raising interest rates too soon could pour cold water on the U.S. economic recovery, according to minutes from the Fed's Jan. 27-28 meeting.""The minutes reflect our view that while the economy is growing, an interest rate liftoff is not a slam dunk at this point,"" said Alan Gayle, senior investment strategist at RidgeWorth Investments in Atlanta.""Clearly, there are some more dovish members that feel the economy is still not strong enough to support steady pricing, so that is holding the Fed back from normalizing policy.""Stocks generally have risen with any sign the Fed could raise rates later rather than sooner. An index of S&P 500 utilities, which tend to do well in a low interest-rate environment, jumped 2.4 percent and was the biggest positive in the S&P 500 as bond yields declined. S&P financial shares, which tend to benefit from a higher rate environment, declined 0.7 percent.The Dow Jones industrial average fell 17.73 points, or 0.1 percent, to 18,029.85, the S&P 500 lost 0.66 points, or 0.03 percent, to 2,099.68 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 7.10 points, or 0.14 percent, to 4,906.36.The day's move breaks a two-session string of record closing highs for the S&P 500. Investors also weighed developments involving Greece. The European Central Bank agreed a modest increase in emergency funding for Greek banks, putting pressure on Athens to strike a financing deal with its European partners before its lenders run out of money.Fossil Group Inc shares sank 15.7 percent to $83.69 after the fashion accessory maker reported quarterly earnings and revenue below expectations.Also on the earnings front, Garmin Ltd fell 10.7 percent to $50.71 after the navigation device maker gave an earnings outlook below estimates.About 6.0 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, below the 7.2 billion average for the month so far, according to BATS Global Markets.Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by 1,662 to 1,403, for a 1.18-to-1 ratio on the upside; on the Nasdaq, 1,429 issues rose and 1,303 fell for a 1.10-to-1 ratio favoring advancers.The S&P 500 posted 58 new 52-week highs and two new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 83 new highs and 26 new lows.

Fed policymakers expressed concern last month that raising interest rates too soon could pour cold water on the U.S. economic recovery, and fretted over the impact of dropping ""patient"" from the central bank's interest rate guidance.""I think it's probably much more dovish than anybody anticipated, that's for sure. I think June is going to be hard for them to move, but that's not to say they won't,"" said Greg Peters, senior investment officer at Prudential Fixed Income in Newark, New Jersey. An index of S&P 500 utilities was up 2.1 percent and the biggest positive in the S&P 500 as bond yields declined.Energy shares were the biggest drag, led by Exxon Mobil , which fell 2.5 percent to $90.68 following news of an explosion and fire at an Exxon refinery near Los Angeles. At 2:27 p.m., the Dow Jones industrial average fell 37.51 points, or 0.21 percent, to 18,010.07, the S&P 500  lost 4.45 points, or 0.21 percent, to 2,095.89 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 4.01 points, or 0.08 percent, to 4,895.26.Investors also weighed developments involving Greece. The European Central Bank agreed to raise the emergency funding available to Greek banks, a slight increase on the previous limit, a person familiar with the ECB talks said. The move is likely to give Athens some leeway while it tries to negotiate a financing deal with European partners.Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 1,557 to 1,480, for a 1.05-to-1 ratio; on the Nasdaq, 1,402 issues fell and 1,281 advanced for a 1.09-to-1 ratio favoring decliners.The S&P 500 was posting 52 new 52-week highs and 2 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite was recording 69 new highs and 23 new lows.

315,"  (Updates with details of violations)By Jarrett RenshawNEW YORK Feb 19 Exxon Mobil Corp's  Torrance, California, refinery, hit by an explosion and fire on Wednesday, was cited in November for eight serious violations following state inspections last year, according to documents released on Thursday.The blast and blaze that ripped through a gasoline processing unit at the refinery near Los Angeles slightly injured four workers. It prompted area schools to keep students and staff indoors as a precaution.On Nov. 24, California's Division of Division of Occupational Safety and Health, better known as Cal/OSHA, cited the refinery for eight serious and 17 general violations and fined Exxon Mobil $41,320, according to the documents. The citation, which Exxon has appealed, resulted from 10 routine inspections of the facility.A serious violation is defined as one that could result in serious injury or death.Exxon Mobil spokesman Todd Spitler did not immediately comment on the violations. The infractions run the gamut from minor incidents like failing to insulate hot tube ends, to more serious ones, like failing to inform employees about the presence of asbestos.The highest penalties - $6,750 a piece - were related to respirators known as 5-minute escape bottles, or ""Spare Air"", which are deployed in an emergency. Inspectors say the company did not have a procedure for the proper use of the equipment in a key area of the facility, including failing to provide instructions on how to use a nose clip to prevent workers from inhaling dangerous fumes while using the device.None of the violations concerned the fluid catalytic cracker, the unit involved in Wednesday's explosion, which will remain shut down until an investigation into the cause of the blast is complete. The probe is expected to take up to six months.The violations were by far the most the refinery had received in the past five years, according to a Cal/OSHA compilation.

318,"  LONDON Exxon Mobil Corp plans to add high-quality lubricants production to its 190,000 barrel per day (bpd) Rotterdam refinery, the company said on Thursday.Exxon is also considering expanding production of high-quality fuels such as diesel at Rotterdam, an investment in the struggling European refining sector that would follow a $1 billion project announced last year to expand diesel output at its 320,000 bpd Antwerp refinery.The company said the upgrades remain subject to regulatory approval by Dutch authorities and funding approval by its Dutch affiliate, Esso Nederland BV. Exxon declined comment on the cost of the plan, but Stephen George, chief economist at consultancy KBC Advanced Technologies, said based on the rough outline currently available the full project was unlikely to exceed 200 to 300 million euros.  The lubricant upgrade would allow Exxon to produce so-called Group II base oil feedstocks, which manufacture higher quality lubricants that have taken over much of the non-industrial market in Europe as a result of emissions regulations. Exxon recently added Group II production to its plants in Asia and the United States.      The proposal filed with Dutch authorities also outlined a 40 percent increase in capacity at the refinery's 50,000 bpd hydrocracker to just under 70,000 bpd.

324,"   By Sonali Paul | MELBOURNE  MELBOURNE Oil and gas producer Santos Ltd reported a 6 percent rise in underlying profit for 2014, boosted by liquefied natural gas (LNG) sales from Papua New Guinea, but disappointed with its dividend as it looks to save cash amid an oil price slump.Santos, which has a share in ExxonMobil's PNG LNG project launched last May and said it was on track to start exports from its flagship $18.5 billion project, Gladstone LNG (GLNG), in the second half of this year, has been hard hit by a 50 percent drop in oil prices.Its shares hit a 10-year low in December, while analysts have also raised doubts that the Gladstone project will have enough gas from coal seam gas fields to meet its contracts for 20 years.Santos Chief Executive David Knox said on Friday the company would cut its operating costs by 10 percent in 2015 as well as slashing capital spending by a quarter, and insisted that GLNG would be profitable even if oil fell as far as $40 a barrel.Knox said the Gladstone project would have ample supplies from proven reserves, gas from third parties and its own resource base, which has yet to be confirmed as economic. He was also encouraged that wells at one of the company's coal seam gas fields had proven to be 20 percent more productive than expected.""That's a really important result for us, and it does mean we can reduce our capital spend,"" he told reporters.Santos said it had proven and probable gas reserves of 5,600 petajoules, but below a prediction for 2014 made four years ago for 8,000 PJ, noted Credit Suisse analyst Mark Samter. ""So what gives us any confidence that they'll have enough gas?"" said Samter.Santos' underlying profit rose to A$533 million ($415 million) in 2014 from A$504 million a year earlier, but was below analysts' forecasts around A$544 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. It held its final dividend steady at 15 cents, which was 25 percent below market forecasts.Santos shares fell 2.8 percent in afternoon trade, underperforming the broader market. The company also put in place a fully underwritten dividend reinvestment plan, which analysts said was not in line with its progressive dividend policy as it effectively would not be paying out any cash.Knox said Santos continued to see raising funds through a share sale as a last resort to ease the strain on its balance sheet and would even be willing to risk a cut in its credit rating to one notch above junk status.

325,"   By Alex Dobuzinskis | TORRANCE, Calif.  TORRANCE, Calif. Gasoline production at an Exxon Mobil Corp refinery near Los Angeles has been halted since an explosion there on Wednesday, a plant manager said on Friday, raising the possibility of higher fuel prices in parts of Southern California.Investigators were trying to determine the cause of the blast in Torrance, California, south of downtown Los Angeles, which sent four contract workers to the hospital with minor injuries.Refinery manager Brian Ablett said Exxon has an unspecified volume of gasoline in storage at the plant but did not say at what rate it might release those stocks, nor did he have an estimate for when production might resume.    California lacks pipelines to carry locally refined gasoline across the state and its supplies are further restricted by environmental rules requiring a less-polluting blend of gasoline and diesel fuel, which few out-of-state refineries make.    The explosion ripped open a massive, box-like filtration unit at the refinery, the electrostatic precipitator, and spread a layer of ash over nearby homes. The blast also damaged a unit that cleans water for boilers and another unit that removes sulfur from gasoline, Ablett said. Moreover, inspectors need to assess damage to the fluid catalytic cracker, the facility's main gasoline-producing unit, he said.""It will be some time before we fully know what happened,"" Ablett told reporters ahead of a meeting with local residents. The California Department of Industrial Relations has opened a probe at the refinery, which normally can produce about 150,000 barrels of gasoline per day. The refinery still has some production capacity, but the company's first priority is to make sure all the units are structurally safe, Ablett said.The price of gasoline in Los Angeles surged to its highest level in about 18 months after the explosion on fears that local supply would tighten in the coming weeks.  Shorter supply could mean higher pump prices just as Californians and other U.S. motorists are benefiting from a slump in crude oil prices.Exxon Mobil officials at a town hall meeting on Friday attended by more than 100 people faced pointed questions about ash from the explosion, which an aide to a local state legislator said was spread as far as 2 miles from the refinery.  The refinery's physician, Ellyn McIntosh, told the crowd an analysis of the ash shows it consisted of aluminum oxide, amorphous silica and a type of clay. The substance can cause irritation, but not significant health problems, she said.

326,"  HOUSTON Feb 23 Exxon Mobil Corp, the world's largest publicly traded oil company, said on Monday its crude oil and natural gas reserves rose slightly in 2014, lifted by U.S. shale and oil sands projects.Proved reserve additions of 1.5 billion barrels oil equivalent from projects including the Permian Basin in West Texas and the Kearl oil sands project in Canada helped Exxon replace 104 percent of its 2014 output, the Irving, Texas company said in a statement.Proved reserves are those oil and natural gas deposits that can be economically recovered using existing technology. ""Our ability to achieve an industry-leading record of long-term reserves replacement is made possible by the size and diversity of Exxon Mobil's resource base along with its project execution and technical capabilities,"" Exxon Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson said in a statement.In 2013, Exxon's reserve replacement ratio, a key measure of growth for investors, was 103 percent. At year end, Exxon's proved reserves totaled 25.3 billion oil-equivalent barrels. The reserves were 54 percent liquids, which typically bring higher profits, up from 53 percent in 2013. Chevron Corp, the second-largest U.S.-based oil producer, said on Friday its oil and natural gas reserves fell 1 percent last year largely due to the sale of its stake in a Chad oil field.Shares of Exxon slipped nearly 1 percent to $89.16 in morning New York Stock Exchange Trading in a day when most energy companies were lower along with crude oil..

332,"  (Adds Conoco arbitrator resigned, details on Exxon)By Alexandra UlmerCARACAS Feb 25 Venezuela has requested the annulment of a World Bank tribunal award that orders it pay Exxon Mobil Corp $1.6 billion in compensation for nationalizations, both sides said on Wednesday.George Kahale, Venezuela's lawyer, said he did not know when the tribunal was likely to issue a decision on the request.""The first step is for the appointment of the committee to hear the annulment application, and that has not happened yet,"" said the lawyer with Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle LLP.""The schedule for the annulment process will not be determined until after the committee is appointed.""Exxon said earlier on Wednesday the South American OPEC country had filed for an annulment of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes award on Feb. 2. ""The application alleges that, in issuing the ICSID award, the Tribunal exceeded its powers, failed to state reasons on which the ICSID award was based, and departed from a fundamental rule of procedure,"" Exxon said in its 10-K filing.The move contrasts with October, when Venezuela deemed the award a victory for its sovereignty and oil workers were shown on TV celebrating.ICSID says on its website that ""annulment is an exceptional recourse to safeguard against the violation of fundamental legal principles relating to the process."" Venezuela had also requested revisions to the award because it argues a previous decision from Paris-based International Chamber of Commerce for $908 million should be deducted from the ICSID award.The appeals for an annulment and revisions have led to stays on the award, Exxon said.Delays to the enforcement of hefty arbitration awards grant Nicolas Maduro's government some breathing room as it struggles with a tumble in oil prices, arrears with private companies, debt payments, and campaigns for this year's parliamentary election.

Pharmaceutical company Actavis Plc launched a $21 billion corporate bond deal, the second-largest on record, according to Thomson Reuters unit IFR.

In 2014, Exxon produced 4 million barrels oil equivalent per day (boed) and it plans to ramp up to 4.3 million boed in 2017.  Exxon had already scaled back its spending plans. In a regulatory filing last week, it said it expected to spend about $34 billion over the next several years, down from a prior forecast for capital expenditures around $37 billion and less than $42.5 billion in 2013.

349,"   By Hilary Russ  ExxonMobil has agreed to pay New Jersey $225 million to settle a long-standing lawsuit over environmental damage from its refinery operations and service stations, state officials said on Thursday.The New York Times last week reported a pending agreement in the long-running lawsuit, which was potentially worth nearly $9 billion. That prompted questions about why New Jersey Governor Chris Christie's administration would settle for so little after such a hard-fought legal battle.Christie is a likely Republican contender in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.Democrats, who lead New Jersey's legislature, have said they will intervene in the lawsuit and have scheduled a March 19 hearing to probe the deal. The state would not receive money from the deal until fiscal 2016 at the earliest, and the accord must be approved by the judge overseeing the 2004 lawsuit after a public comment period, according to a statement from acting Attorney General John J. Hoffman and Department of Environmental Protection Commissioner Bob Martin.Exxon did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. In its annual report, filed on Feb. 25, Exxon noted settlement talks with the state of Arkansas but did not mention the New Jersey litigation. The potential payout for New Jersey comes on top of Exxon's separate obligation to pay for cleaning up two refinery sites in Bayonne and Linden, Hoffman said.The accord preserves some of New Jersey's other claims against Exxon, including for alleged damages to surface water in the Arthur Kill and Newark Bay. The environmental settlement is the biggest with a corporate defendant in New Jersey history, Martin said. The previous largest was for $35.5 million in 2014 in a case against Hess Corp.The Exxon case had already gone to trial, for 66 days last year. Superior Court Judge Michael Hogan was in the process of determining damages when the two sides settled, the New York Times has reported.""This important settlement, which came about because this administration aggressively pushed the case to trial, is the result of long fought settlement negotiations that pre-dated and post-dated the trial,"" Hoffman said.",2015-03-05,XOM,"Thu Mar 5, 2015 | 2:16pm EST",Exxon settles New Jersey environmental lawsuit for $225 mln,http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-exxon-mobil-new-jersey-idUSL1N0W71ZX20150305?type=companyNews

353,"  New Jersey's long legal battle to recover $8.9 billion from Exxon Mobil Corp for environmental damage ended when Governor Chris Christie's chief counsel, Christopher Porrino, cut a deal to settle for $250 million, the New York Times reported, citing two people familiar with the negotiation.The Times reported last week that the settlement, which has not been made public, had been reached after 11 years of legal battle over New Jersey's claim for damages from Exxon Mobil for the contamination of more than 1,500 acres of wetlands and waters. On Thursday, the newspaper quoted Bradley Campbell, commissioner of New Jersey's Department of Environmental Protection when the case was filed in 2004, as saying the favorable deal was reached when Porrino became involved.Porrino ""inserted himself into the case, elbowed aside the attorney general and career employees who had developed and prosecuted the litigation, and cut the deal favorable to Exxon,"" the Times quoted Bradley as saying.  The decision to settle for ""roughly three cents on the dollar"" after years of litigation was an ""embarrassment to law enforcement and good government,"" Bradley said in a separate  opinion piece in the newspaper, headlined ""Shortchanging New Jersey by Billions"". New Jersey Assembly speaker Vincent Prieto and John Mckeon, chairman of the assembly's judiciary committee, both Democrats, plan to hold a hearing on the deal on March 19, the report said. Christie, a Republican, is considered a potential presidential candidate but has not yet declared his intentions. Exxon and Christie's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment and Campbell could not be reached.

354,"   By Ron Bousso and Dmitry Zhdannikov | LONDON  LONDON The world’s two biggest oil firms, Exxon Mobil Corp and Royal Dutch Shell, may withstand the oil price collapse better than their rivals because they are closer to finishing expensive investment projects while others must keep spending.The near halving of oil prices since June is likely to send all the biggest listed oil companies into negative cash flow this year, and has sparked a rush to cut costs across the sector as a result. But depending on where they are in their spending cycles, some companies are finding those cuts easier to make than others.""Both (Exxon and Shell) had already entered a lower spending phase, with major projects reaching completion and coming on stream over the next two years,"" Moody's rating company said in a report.Exxon started eight major oil and gas production projects last year in locations ranging from Papua New Guinea to the Gulf of Mexico and Abu Dhabi.Shell started four big production start-ups last year in the Cardamom and Mars B oil fields in the Gulf of Mexico as well as other oil fields in Nigeria and Malaysia.As a result Exxon, the world's biggest publicly traded oil company, was able to cut its 2015 project spending by 11 percent to around $34 billion without significant impact on its production. Shell, the second-largest, opted for a $15 billion cut over the next three years and maintained its 2015 capital spending at $35 billion which will also not affect its output.Chevron and Total, on the other hand, are both in the midst of large project spending cycles, and will have to tap into more debt in order to stay afloat, Moody's said.Elsewhere BP, despite cutting costs and jobs and freezing salaries, still faces sizeable outgoings related to its 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill fine and its stake in Russian oil champion Rosneft.Most big oil firms announced cuts of 10 to 15 percent to their 2015 budgets versus last year. Some suspended share buybacks, revived dividend payment via company stock, known as scrip shares, and maintained dividends flat in order to boost cashflows. While all companies are expected to keep paying high dividends by increasing borrowing, Anglo-Dutch Shell and Texas-based Exxon appear to be most able to cover both spending and dividend payouts if oil prices stay at their current $60 a barrel. They are also likely to be able to pick up bargain assets, while the price collapse shakes the sector out.""Those who have stronger balance sheets would be able to acquire more assets in the downturn, for example distressed and cheap U.S. shale producers,"" said Kirill Pyshkin who helps manage over $400 million in global and U.S. equity funds at Mirabaud Asset Management in London, including shares in Shell.Pyshkin noted too: ""If oil prices recover they won't have to sacrifice their growth budgets and hence will be growing faster than peers in future."" LOWER BREAKEVEN  Exxon and Shell also lead the rest of the pack in terms of where their cashflow breaks even. They can survive on a much lower price of oil to cover project spending, operating costs and dividend payments.According to analysts at Jefferies, Shell and Exxon both have 2015 breakevens of around $75 to $80 a barrel.While that's still significantly higher than the average 2015 Brent price of around $56 a barrel, it's healthier than Chevron, BP and Eni's breakevens which Jefferies forecast at around $95, $100 and $120 a barrel respectively.For some however, while Exxon is a safe investment, its dividend is relatively low compared to its peers and its shares offer little upside because of the steady course the firm is now on. Other peers and smaller companies offer better returns.""Although it (Exxon) retains significant defensive strengths should oil prices dip again, we think the market is now beginning to deploy its investment dollars in higher risk plays,"" BMO Capital Markets analyst Iain Reid wrote in a note to investors. Reid's key pick is Shell, which still has ""plenty of firepower to deliver further upside via more aggressive restructuring"". Total, which is further behind in the spending cycle may however also offer higher returns for investors in the future, Reid added.According to Reuters data, 15 out of 23 polled analysts are neutral on Exxon shares, while 5 rate it a ""buy"". Shell is more attractive for analysts, with 10 out of 20 recommending a ""buy"" and 9 a ""hold"".Total remains the most robust stock, with 17 ""buy"", 16 ""hold and 2 ""sell"" recommendation.BORROWING UP All of the big oil firms are expected to see negative cash flows this year, according to Moody's, and will turn to borrowing in order to cover costs. All have indicated they would have no problem increasing borrowing this year, given their debt-to-equity ratios below 20 percent.

361,"  (Adds declaration of force majeure, diversion of tanker to other port, efforts to contain vapors)By Kristen HaysHOUSTON, March 11 Exxon Mobil Corp said on Wednesday that it cut production rates at the second-largest refinery in the United States as crude deliveries were held up by wreckage that partially closed the Houston Ship Channel for a third day.Exxon said it was working with the U.S. Coast Guard and the Port of Houston to resume crude shipments as soon as possible to its 560,500 barrels per day (bpd) refinery in Baytown, Texas, which sits along the country's busiest petrochemicals waterway.Royal Dutch Shell Plc also said it was evaluating the closure's impact on its 327,000 bpd joint-venture refinery in Deer Park, Texas, and LyondellBasell  said its 263,776 bpd plant in Houston had experienced no operational impacts. The Coast Guard said crews launched a plan on Wednesday to contain flammable vapors emanating from a damaged tanker so it could be safely moved, which would allow the channel to reopen.On Monday, the double-hulled Carla Maersk tanker carrying 216,000 barrels of gasoline additive methyl tertiary-butyl ether, or MTBE, collided with a bulk carrier hauling steel near Morgan's Point, just south of Baytown, prompting the closure. The bulk carrier was moved on Tuesday. J.J. Plunkett, port agent for the Houston Pilots, said 43 inbound and 33 outbound vessels were waiting to move on Wednesday, up from 36 inbound and 28 outbound on Tuesday. Those include all kinds of ships.Enterprise Products Partners suspended docking operations for ships and barges at its Oiltanking Partners unit on the ship channel, applying force majeure retroactively to the shutdown on Monday, according to a Bloomberg story seen by traders. One of two tankers carrying Mexican crude that had been waiting outside of Houston since fog held up deliveries for four days last week had started moving east to Nederland on Wednesday, according to ClipperData, which tracks crude movements. Sunoco Logistics Partners has a huge storage complex in Nederland.Traffic in and out of Galveston, Texas City and Bayport on the south end of the waterway has been operating as usual.An unknown amount of MTBE spilled upon impact. The Coast Guard said on Wednesday that crews would contain vapors with dense foam so the liquid cargo could be removed, allowing for safe movement of the tanker.Plunkett said the hope was to get traffic moving by daybreak on Thursday.

362,"  (Repeats March 10 story with no change to text)* Two biggest oil firms have finished major projects* Exxon, Shell able to cut 2015 spending* All oil majors face 2015 negative cashflow* Set to increase borrowing easily to cover shortfallsBy Ron Bousso and Dmitry ZhdannikovLONDON, March 10 The world's two biggest oil firms, Exxon Mobil Corp and Royal Dutch Shell, may withstand the oil price collapse better than their rivals because they are closer to finishing expensive investment projects while others must keep spending.The near halving of oil prices since June is likely to send all the biggest listed oil companies into negative cash flow this year, and has sparked a rush to cut costs across the sector as a result. But depending on where they are in their spending cycles, some companies are finding those cuts easier to make than others.""Both (Exxon and Shell) had already entered a lower spending phase, with major projects reaching completion and coming on stream over the next two years,"" Moody's rating company said in a report.Exxon started eight major oil and gas production projects last year in locations ranging from Papua New Guinea to the Gulf of Mexico and Abu Dhabi.Shell started four big production start-ups last year in the Cardamom and Mars B oil fields in the Gulf of Mexico as well as other oil fields in Nigeria and Malaysia.As a result Exxon, the world's biggest publicly traded oil company, was able to cut its 2015 project spending by 11 percent to around $34 billion without significant impact on its production. Shell, the second-largest, opted for a $15 billion cut over the next three years and maintained its 2015 capital spending at $35 billion which will also not affect its output.Chevron and Total, on the other hand, are both in the midst of large project spending cycles, and will have to tap into more debt in order to stay afloat, Moody's said. Elsewhere BP, despite cutting costs and jobs and freezing salaries, still faces sizeable outgoings related to its 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill fine and its stake in Russian oil champion Rosneft.Most big oil firms announced cuts of 10 to 15 percent to their 2015 budgets versus last year. Some suspended share buybacks, revived dividend payment via company stock, known as scrip shares, and maintained dividends flat in order to boost cashflows.While all companies are expected to keep paying high dividends by increasing borrowing, Anglo-Dutch Shell and Texas-based Exxon appear to be most able to cover both spending and dividend payouts if oil prices stay at their current $60 a barrel.^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Graphic: Oil majors 2015 breakeven oil price  link.reuters.com/kek34w    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ They are also likely to be able to pick up bargain assets, while the price collapse shakes the sector out.""Those who have stronger balance sheets would be able to acquire more assets in the downturn, for example distressed and cheap U.S. shale producers,"" said Kirill Pyshkin who helps manage over $400 million in global and U.S. equity funds at Mirabaud Asset Management in London, including shares in Shell.Pyshkin noted too: ""If oil prices recover they won't have to sacrifice their growth budgets and hence will be growing faster than peers in future.""LOWER BREAKEVEN Exxon and Shell also lead the rest of the pack in terms of where their cashflow breaks even. They can survive on a much lower price of oil to cover project spending, operating costs and dividend payments. According to analysts at Jefferies, Shell and Exxon both have 2015 breakevens of around $75 to $80 a barrel.While that's still significantly higher than the average 2015 Brent price of around $56 a barrel, it's healthier than Chevron, BP and Eni's breakevens which Jefferies forecast at around $95, $100 and $120 a barrel respectively.For some however, while Exxon is a safe investment, its dividend is relatively low compared to its peers and its shares offer little upside because of the steady course the firm is now on. Other peers and smaller companies offer better returns.""Although it (Exxon) retains significant defensive strengths should oil prices dip again, we think the market is now beginning to deploy its investment dollars in higher risk plays,"" BMO Capital Markets analyst Iain Reid wrote in a note to investors.Reid's key pick is Shell, which still has ""plenty of firepower to deliver further upside via more aggressive restructuring"". Total, which is further behind in the spending cycle may however also offer higher returns for investors in the future, Reid added.According to Reuters data, 15 out of 23 polled analysts are neutral on Exxon shares, while 5 rate it a ""buy"". Shell is more attractive for analysts, with 10 out of 20 recommending a ""buy"" and 9 a ""hold"".Total remains the most robust stock, with 17 ""buy"", 16 ""hold and 2 ""sell"" recommendation.BORROWING UP All of the big oil firms are expected to see negative cash flows this year, according to Moody's, and will turn to borrowing in order to cover costs.All have indicated they would have no problem increasing borrowing this year, given their debt-to-equity ratios below 20 percent.""The majors with their AA and AAA ratings still have access to attractive sources of funding. Their balance sheets have the capacity to absorb one or two years of low prices,"" said Wood Mackenzie analyst Tom Ellacott.

363,"  (Updates with detail throughout, adds byline)By Jessica Resnick-AultMarch 11 Exxon Mobil Corp said its fire brigade had quickly extinguished a blaze Wednesday evening at its 155,000-barrel-a-day Torrance, California, refinery, the site of a Feb. 18 fire.The company said there were no injuries in the second blaze. The local fire department also arrived at the plant to offer assistance, Exxon said in a statement. Exxon did not specify where in the refinery the fire broke out. The fire did not affect the refinery's current operations, according to the company's statement. Five investigators from the U.S. Chemical Safety Board were at the plant Wednesday to investigate the Feb. 18 explosion. They had just left the plant when the blast occurred, according to Daniel Horowitz, a senior adviser to the CSB. The previous fire broke out in the refinery's gasoline-producing fluid catalytic cracking unit. The company is still operating the refinery at reduced rates after the previous incident.Exxon told analysts last week that the unit that had the previous incident was an emission controls device on a gasoline-making unit, and that they were still securing and assessing that unit. Exxon said it had parts of the refinery running crude and has plans to restart other parts next month. Longer-term, Exxon said it has been working with regulators to determine whether it can restart the unit without the emissions device. Exxon did not immediately say whether the restart plans for next month would be affected by the latest fire.The United Steelworkers union, which represents refinery workers at about 70 plants across the U.S., have been on strike for 39 days as of Wednesday at 15 plants, including 12 refineries. Workers at the Torrance refinery have not been on strike.

364,"  (Adds prospective bidders and line on company comment; changes value and source on Permian assets)By Mike Stone and Ernest ScheyderNEW YORK/WILLISTON, N.D., March 13 Whiting Petroleum Corp, North Dakota's largest oil producer, has put Texas acreage and pipeline assets up for sale as an alternative to a sale of the full company, according to sources familiar with the matter.This strategy could appease investors outraged by the possibility of any outright sale. It would dispose of assets not central to the core shale operations and generate cash for the company's balance sheet, laden with more than $3 billion in debt after the December buyout of smaller rival Kodiak Oil & Gas.JPMorgan has shopped the full company in recent days to select parties, several people said. However, several potential acquirers' interest in buying all of Whiting was tepid due to concerns about Whiting's $5.63 billion debt load, the sources said.One of the people said a bid deadline has been scheduled for next week.The people were granted anonymity to speak freely about the process, but they were not authorized to speak on the record.Exxon Mobil Corp, Continental Resources Inc, Statoil ASA and Hess Corp are interested in the company, Bloomberg said, citing unidentified sources.Representatives for Whiting, Hess and JPMorgan declined to comment. Representatives for Exxon, Continental, Statoil and were not immediately available for comment.ANGER OVER SALE TALK AFTER STOCK FALL  Although the Kodiak buyout did stress financial metrics at Denver-based Whiting, it gave the company unparalleled growth opportunities in the No. 2 U.S. oil-producing state for an exceptionally cheap price.Whiting acquired Kodiak's proven reserves of roughly 167 million barrels of oil equivalent for $23.77 per barrel, far below the current benchmark price for U.S. crude oil, roughly $47 per barrel.Given that cost advantage, some on Wall Street were irked that executives would consider selling Whiting now, after a nearly 60 percent drop in the company's stock since last summer. The logic of any deal seemed to contradict the dictum of buy low, sell high.Yet media reports last week indicated that the company, led by 67-year-old Chief Executive Officer Jim Volker, was pursuing an auction process, essentially shopping itself to find the highest bidder. The news surprised two people at the company who are regularly briefed by senior management. Investors said the timing would be inappropriate for a company known for having excellent acreage but whose share price has tumbled alongside oil.""This is not the way you run a deal process,"" said one major Whiting shareholder who declined to be named, citing concern he might offend the company's management. The investor said he was ""pissed"" the company would even casually entertain the idea of any sale in this environment.Investors also disliked the idea of seeing fast-growing Whiting bought out by a slow-growing U.S. major oil company such as Chevron Corp or Exxon Mobil in an all-stock deal, insisting the company can go it alone despite what is expected to be an increase in buyouts across the energy industry.""I would much rather own shares of Whiting than shares in a multinational"" oil company, a second major investor said. ASSET SALES Whiting has more than 64,000 acres in the Permian shale formation of western Texas holding roughly 17 percent of the company's total proven oil reserves.Much of this acreage is produced using waterflood and carbon dioxide injection, an expensive, older strategy typically favored by niche companies that prefer to operate on the fringe of the oil industry, not the fast-moving core of shale operations.The deal for the Permian assets could fetch more than $900 million, according to a person briefed on the matter.Whiting has signaled for weeks that its pipeline and gas-processing facilities are part of any possible asset sales, telling analysts last month, for example, that its Redtail processing plant could fetch interest.The strategy is not new. In 2012, Whiting sold a 50 percent stake in a Belfield, North Dakota, processing plant to MDU Resources Inc for $66 million.Appetite for partnerships or outright sales could be higher now after Kinder Morgan paid $3 billion two months ago to buy North Dakota pipeline and logistics company Highland Partners.""There's definitely a red-hot market right now for midstream assets,"" one Whiting investor said.

365,"  HOUSTON Exxon Mobil Corp and the United Steelworkers union traded proposals on Tuesday for a labor contract covering Exxon's refinery in Beaumont, Texas, that could be for as long as seven or eight years, union officials said.That would be roughly double the length of the contract under a tentative national agreement reached last week, which would cover about 30,000 workers for four years.Exxon had been pushing for a five-year contract for hourly workers at the 344,600 barrel per day (bpd) Beaumont refinery, which is the company's third-largest. Work at the refinery has continued during labor negotiations under an extension of the prior contract.Sources familiar with Exxon's plans have said the longer agreement was sought, in part, because the company is considering an expansion at the Beaumont refinery that could more than double its size.Exxon has said its wants to assure stability for the company and its employees. The four-year industry-wide agreement reached last week by the USW and lead U.S. refinery owner representative Royal Dutch Shell Plc is one year longer than previous contracts; it would end a strike that began on Feb. 1.On Tuesday, Exxon offered USW local union 13-243 representing Beaumont refinery workers the current four-year national agreement plus an additional two years. USW local 13-243 negotiators countered with the current national agreement, often referred to as the pattern agreement, plus the next national agreement, which would amount to a seven- or eight-year contract for workers at the Beaumont refinery. ""It's unprecedented,"" USW local 13-243's president, Robert Hill, said. ""It could be a seven- or eight-year deal.""An Exxon spokesman said the company would like to move to an agreement that is not tied to the pattern bargaining cycle.  ""We seek to maintain the competitive position and unique advantages of the Beaumont refinery, which drive our interest in moving to a non-pattern term,"" Exxon spokesman Todd Spitler said. At its non-pattern sites, Exxon offers better terms than those in the national pattern agreement, Spitler said.""We remain hopeful that this process will be successful and result in a mutually acceptable contract."" The union, however, has a different view on company's preference for non-pattern terms. Hill said the goal seems to be to reduce the leverage of USW-represented workers at the Beaumont refinery by moving the contract out of sync with the national pattern. ""They just want to get us off of the pattern date,"" Hill said.

366,"  (Adds details)MOSCOW, March 17 Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak plans to meet Exxon's chief executive officer, Rex Tillerson, on Wednesday, a ministry official told Reuters.The official declined to give any more details for the meeting, which comes as Western sanctions, imposed on Russia over its actions in Ukraine, have prevented the U.S. company from participating in several projects in Russia. Tillerson last visited Moscow in June 2014 when he affirmed his commitment to doing business with Russia.Last year, Exxon was forced by the sanctions to suspend its joint operations with Russia's top oil producer Rosneft  in the offshore Arctic, where they successfully performed exploration drilling. A Rosneft spokeswoman declined to comment on any possible meeting of Tillerson and Rosneft's head, Igor Sechin. The sanctions prevent Western companies from giving Russia technology for Arctic offshore, deepwater and shale oil development. Rosneft will not resume drilling in the Arctic Kara Sea this year because of the sanctions.Exxon has also been involved in a joint oil and gas project with Rosneft, Sakhalin-1, which produces over 100,000 barrels per day of oil. Sakhalin-1 is not subject to the sanctions.

375,"  MOSCOW, March 18 U.S. oil and gas major ExxonMobil has asked the Russian government to reimburse taxes worth ""several billion roubles"" it says it overpaid on a project in the far east of Russia, the Kommersant daily reported on Wednesday.The newspaper, citing unnamed sources, said ExxonMobil believes it overpaid profit taxes on its Sakhalin-1 oil and gas project. Russia reduced the profit tax in 2009 to 20 percent but ExxonMobil continued to pay at the earlier level of 35 percent after the project broke even in 2008, it said.ExxonMobil, which owns 30 percent in Sakhalin-1, in Moscow declined immediate comment. Kommersant quoted a source as saying that ExxonMobil had threatened to lodge a claim with the Stockholm arbitration court unless Russia cut its taxes for the project in line with the lower profit tax which applies across the country. It said the claims amounted to ""several billions of roubles"". In 2014, the company overpaid by 10 billion roubles ($163.7 million), the newspaper said, citing a source. Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak plans to meet Exxon's chief executive officer, Rex Tillerson, later on Wednesday. The newspaper also said that Tillerson would meet Finance Minister Anton Siluanov, Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich and Rosneft's Chief Executive Officer Igor Sechin.

380,"   By Erwin Seba | HOUSTON  HOUSTON Exxon Mobil Corp is considering scaling up plans for a multibillion-dollar expansion of its Beaumont, Texas, oil refinery to make it one of the largest in the world, according to sources familiar with the plans.Since at least last summer, Exxon has been quietly contemplating a major project to expand Beaumont in what would be the biggest U.S. refinery investment since the shale revolution, which has transformed the country into a growing producer and handed refiners a profit windfall of cheap crude.Initially the company was considering doubling the current 344,600-barrel-per-day (bpd) capacity by 2020, Reuters reported last year. Now it may go as high as 850,000 bpd by the end of the decade, according to the sources, a figure that would make it the largest U.S. plant and fourth-largest in the world.The latest details of the expansion plan, on which it has not made a final decision, emerged from Exxon's campaign for a longer-than-usual term for the contract with the United Steelworkers union (USW) local chapter at the refinery.Exxon has offered a minimum six-year contract consisting of the current four-year agreement negotiated earlier this month by the national union and U.S. refiners, plus two more years, according to the company. The USW has countered with a proposal that would assure no work stoppages during the current national agreement and in the next national agreement, which is expected to be three to four years in length.An Exxon spokesman declined to discuss a possible expansion of the Beaumont refinery. ""Exxon Mobil regularly evaluates its global portfolio of businesses and opportunities for growth, depending upon the fit with its strategic business objectives,"" said Exxon spokesman Lee Dula.SOUR CRUDE FOCUS  The Beaumont refinery was once a major importer of light or medium sour crudes from countries such as Saudi Arabia and Mexico, according to U.S. government data, but has replaced much of that oil with domestic shale in recent years.The expansion would be done with the addition of a third crude distillation unit, probably configured to run sour crude oil, the sources said.  The refinery currently has a 240,000 bpd CDU that refines sour crude, which has a higher sulfur content and is usually lower in cost. The refinery’s smallest CDU has a daily intake capacity of 110,000 bpd in sweet crude oil. Exxon would also like to reconfigure the smallest CDU to run sour crude oil, the sources said. CDUs perform the initial refining of crude oil coming into a refinery and producing feedstocks for all other production units. At 850,000 bpd, a bigger Beaumont would dwarf what is now the largest U.S. refinery, Motiva Enterprises' [MOTIV.UL] 600,250 bpd Port Arthur, Texas, plant, located 17 miles (27 km) to the southeast. But it would still be smaller than the biggest plants in South Korea and India, each over 1 million bpd.The energy supermajor’s two largest U.S. refineries, the 560,500 bpd plant in Baytown, Texas, and the 502,500 bpd facility in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, also have expiration dates out of sync, often referred to as ""off pattern,"" with the expiration date of national agreements negotiated between the USW and U.S. refinery owners.""The long contract is about the expansion, period,"" said one of the sources. ""Exxon wants all of their largest plants off pattern. They want to expand that refinery by two and a half times.""

The talks come at a time when oversupply is already a major concern for energy investors, contributing to crude being down more than 50 percent from a high reached in June.* Investors will also look ahead to the latest economic data, including the March Chicago Purchasing Managers Index at 9:45 a.m. EDT (1345 GMT) and a reading on March consumer confidence at 10 a.m. Confidence is seen dipping slightly in the latest month. * Trading may be volatile ahead of the March payroll report, due on Friday, when the stock market is closed for the Good Friday holiday. If the report is strong, investors could bet the U.S. Federal Reserve may raise rates earlier than currently expected.* In company news, International Business Machines Corp  said it will invest $3 billion over the next four years in a new 'Internet of Things' unit, aiming to sell its expertise in gathering and making sense of the surge in real-time data.* Office Depot Inc fell 1.1 percent to $9.25 in light premarket trading, a day after the company received a request for additional information from the Federal Trade Commission about its planned purchase by Staples Inc. Staples received the same request. Futures snapshot at 6:58:* S&P 500 e-minis were down 11.5 points, or 0.55 percent, with 118,464 contracts changing hands.* Nasdaq 100 e-minis fell 20 points, or 0.46 percent, in volume of 17,777 contracts.* Dow e-minis dropped 89 points, or 0.5 percent, with 20,424 contracts changing hands.

385,"   By Jessica Resnick-Ault | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Exxon Mobil Corp's planned sale of its Los Angeles-area oil refinery has been delayed until early next year at the earliest following a severe fire in February, four people familiar with the transaction said.The 155,000-barrel-a-day plant was put on the block in September, and a handful of bidders including a West Coast private equity group had been short-listed, according to two of the people.However, the process slowed following a Feb. 18 fire that badly damaged an electrostatic precipitator, a component of a gasoline-producing unit. The site had a subsequent small fire in March.The sale will not take place until the plant is fully repaired, which could put it in the first quarter of 2016, according to the sources. ""A deal was imminent but for the fire,"" said one of the four people, who declined to be named because the matter was not public.  Exxon is selling as oil majors look at jettisoning refineries that do not fit well with their other assets. While few refineries are currently going through auctions, activity is expected to ramp up if oil prices stabilize. The plant has received bids from private equity firms including NTR Partners and refiners such as PBF Energy, according two of the sources. The plant could provide an entry point to the West Coast for either company.  PBF did not make the short list before the fire, said another source familiar with the deal. However, the slate of bidders may change after the incident.""California is the toughest place in the U.S. to operate,"" Chief Executive Officer Tom Nimbley told Reuters last week. ""We are not afraid - we are somewhat contrarian.""NTR Partners did not return requests for comment. The Los Angeles-based company is an energy firm with a focus on West Coast investments, according to its website. One partner, Mario Rodriguez, was a co-founder of Northern Tier Energy LLC, which purchased a Minnesota-based refinery. One of the people said Exxon has been working to unload refineries that are not integrated with chemical plants and do not run North American crude. The Los Angeles plant is one of Exxon's four refineries in the United States that do not have an adjacent chemical plant. A second, in Chalmette, Louisiana, which Exxon operates jointly with Petroleos de Venezuela, is currently on the block. The other two refineries that are not integrated are located in Joliet, Illinois, and Billings, Montana, and process North American crude oil. ""As a matter of practice, we do not comment on market speculation or rumor,"" said Todd Spitler, a spokesman for Exxon Mobil.

386,"   By Dmitry Zhdannikov | LONDON, April 1  LONDON, April 1 The former head of oil company Gulf Keystone said he was talking to several parties, including ExxonMobil, about a rescue for the firm before being forced to quit under pressure from an investor.Gulf Keystone, which has been hit hard by a fall in oil prices and delayed payments for crude by Kurdistan, said this week that Chairman Simon Murray, a former chairman of commodities trader Glencore, had retired.But Murray said he was effectively forced to quit after he disagreed with the firm's decision to raise $41 million through an equity issue at a 21 discount to the market to avoid breaching debt covenants.Murray said he believed the capital increase this week was a bad short-term solution and had been pushing for a longer-term option, such as an offer from investment group T5 led by former Tullow Oil chairman Pat Plunkett.He said there had been other options on the table too.""We had two offers. Pat Plunkett was offering a slightly complicated but interesting solution. Exxon and a Chinese company was looking at us as well. I told the board we should be looking for a long-term solution,"" Murray told Reuters.""Instead the board opted for a panic-mode decision."" A spokesman for Gulf Keystone said the company believed it took the best decision for its shareholders this week and declined to discuss details of Murray's departure or talks with individual parties.""It is not appropriate to comment on individual conversations, beyond saying that the company, supported by its advisers, will continue to select what it views as the best course of action in order to see it through its short-term liquidity issues, and to ensure the greatest value can be achieved for all stakeholders..."" the spokesman said.Exxon Mobil, which in 2012 became the first major oil company to invest in Kurdistan despite opposition from the central government in Baghdad, declined to comment. ""We never comment on potential business opportunities,"" a spokesman said. INVESTOR ROLE The dispute between Kurdistan and Baghdad over oil export rights and payments has had far reaching implications for firms working in Kurdistan, including Gulf Keystone.The firm is owed $200 million by Kurdistan, which has been waiting for money from Baghdad, carries a debt of $575 million and faces a liquidity squeeze ahead of an April deadline to pay $26 million to lenders.Even before the Kurdish Regional Government left bills unpaid, Gulf Keystone had been going through turmoil. Murray became chairman in July 2013 amid a campaign by investors M&G and Capital Group to put new directors on the board due to their concerns about corporate governance and Chief Executive Todd Kozel's large compensation package. Kozel quit in 2014.M&G and Capital Group hold more than five percent each in Gulf Keystone, making them the second and third largest shareholders behind Barclays Wealth, according to Reuters data.Murray said it was M&G which had asked Gulf Keystone's board in a letter to force him out if the company wanted M&G to participate in the new $41 million share issuance this week.M&G, which agreed to subscribe to the new share issue, declined official comment.A source familiar with the M&G strategy said the fund was convinced management changes were needed at Gulf Keystone to improve company performance.""You don't enter into sale negotiations with the position of weakness. The company needed to address short-term liquidity problems first,"" the source said.Murray said he felt different: ""I said I did not want to stand in the way of receiving the money if that is how the board felt. Even though I felt this was not the way"".

387,"  MOSCOW, April 2 U.S. oil and gas major ExxonMobil has lodged a claim against Russia at the Stockholm arbitrage court as part of a tax dispute over its project in Russia's far east, a spokeswoman for Russia's Energy Ministry said on Thursday.The ministry did not provide any details of the lawsuit. Exxon in Moscow declined immediate comment. Exxon believes it overpaid profit taxes on the Sakhalin-1 oil and gas project, in which it owns a 30 percent stake, and is now seeking a cut in taxes and reimbursement of a part of the taxes it already paid, according to local media. Russia reduced the profit tax in 2009 to 20 percent for production-sharing agreements such as Exxon's Sakhalin-1 but Exxon continued to pay at an earlier level of 35 percent after the project broke even in 2008.

Exxon is worth $360 billion. ""There can be no certainty that any offer will ultimately be made for BG,"" BG said in a statement adding that Shell must announce a firm intention to make an offer by May 5, or announce that it does not intend to make an offer.Discussions were first reported by the Wall Street Journal, citing sources familiar with the matter. (on.wsj.com/1FcKGGY)Oil prices have halved since the middle of 2014 due to a shale oil boom in the United States and a decision by Saudi Arabia not to cut production - creating an environment similar to the early 2000s when many super-mergers took place.Back then, oil major BP acquired rival Amoco and Arco, Exxon bought Mobil and Chevron merged with Texaco.  A lot of bankers have argued, however, that the era of easy super-mergers was over since then and the number of fresh acquisition targets was limited.

390,"   By Dmitry Zhdannikov and Karolin Schaps | LONDON  LONDON Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) agreed to buy smaller rival BG Group BG.L for 47 billion pounds ($70 billion) in the first major energy industry merger in more than a decade, closing the gap on market leader U.S. Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) after a plunge in prices. Anglo-Dutch Shell will pay a mix of cash and shares that  values each BG share at around 1,350 pence, the companies said. This is a hefty premium of around 52 percent to the 90-day trading average for BG, setting the bar high for any potential counter-bid by a company such as Exxon, which has said it would also use the downturn in oil markets to expand. The third-biggest oil and gas deal ever by enterprise value will bring Shell assets in Brazil, East Africa, Australia, Kazakhstan and Egypt. BG has some of the world's most ambitious projects in liquefied natural gas (LNG), where demand is growing as consumers turn away from more polluting fuels such as coal. Shell is already the world's leading LNG company and it would get BG's capacity in LNG logistics - complex infrastructure that includes terminals, pipelines, specialized tankers, rigs, super coolers, regasification facilities and storage points. ""We are seeing a gasification of energy demand. Shell clearly recognize this,"" said Richard Gorry, director at JBC Energy Asia. ""That said, Shell is still taking a big gamble because if the price of oil and gas doesn't go back up (in the next 24 months), I would imagine this might put them in a difficult position in terms of cash flow.""BOOST TO RESERVES  Shell said on Wednesday the deal would boost its proven oil and gas reserves by 25 percent. Stitched together by Shell CEO Ben van Beurden and BG Chairman Andrew Gould, the tie-up follows a halving of oil prices since last June, putting a premium on access to proven assets rather than costly exploration. Record low interest rates have made it easy to raise cheap funding for big deals. ""We have been scanning quite a few opportunities, with BG always being at the top of the list of the prospects to combine with,"" Van Beurden told a conference call. ""We have two very strong portfolios combining globally in deep water and integrated gas"". Britain's BG had a market capitalization of $46 billion at Tuesday's close, Shell was worth $202 billion and Exxon, the world's largest energy company by market value, was worth $360 billion.BG's bonds traded up strongly on the deal and its shares closed up 27 percent at 1206 pence. Shell shares fell 5 percent to 1982.5 pence. They were the most traded stocks across Europe on Wednesday, with $1.6 billion of BG shares changing hands and $3 billion of Royal Dutch Shell shares.BG stock has tumbled nearly 28 percent since mid-June, when the slump in global oil prices began. The agreed price is around 20 percent above BG's share price of a year ago.  ""In buying BG, Shell is making a bold strategic bet that oil prices will recover towards the $70-90 level in the medium term,"" said Henderson Global Investors. Brent crude LCOc1 was trading below $57 a barrel on Wednesday.    Barclays bank said Shell would have to persuade its shareholders that it can control capital spending at the new company and show BG's portfolio can deliver the promised growth options beyond Brazil, ""something that, in our view, has been far from evident of late"". One source close to the deal said a counterbid was unlikely. The source said a U.S. company such as Exxon may be doubly wary of getting into a takeover battle after the failure of drugmaker Pfizer's (PFE.N) attempted takeover of AstraZeneca (AZN.L) last year. The deal represents a windfall for Shell's adviser Bank of America Merrill Lynch. BG's advisers are Goldman Sachs and the smaller Robey Warshaw. BAML has underwritten a 3.025-billion-pound bridge loan that will be syndicated to other banks and is expected to be taken out by a capital markets raising, according to the offer documents. OIL PRICE IMPACT With BG, Shell would be the leading foreign oil company in Brazil. Analysts at investment bank Jefferies said they now expected Shell to surpass Exxon as the world's largest publicly traded oil and gas producer by 2018, with output of 4.2 million barrels of oil equivalent per day. Global LNG production was 246 million tonnes last year. The new Shell-BG group would have 18 percent of world output.  Van Beurden said the presence of two large players in Australia, Brazil and China and the European Union might require a detailed conversation with anti-trust authorities, but was unlikely to lead to forced asset sales. The halving in crude prices has created an environment similar to the turn of the millennium, when large mergers reshaped the industry. Back then, BP (BP.L) acquired rivals Amoco and Arco, Exxon bought Mobil and Chevron (CVX.N) merged with Texaco. ""A deal of this size would certainly be getting everyone interested in running the ruler over potential combinations in the natural resources sector,"" said Paul Gait, an analyst at Bernstein Research. But some industry watchers were reluctant to predict another flurry of mega-deals, saying many oil majors cannot afford to put stretched balance sheets under further pressure. ""If you're looking to the next big deal, Exxon Mobil stands out as most likely to pull the trigger,"" said Wood Mackenzie. ""But don't expect a wave of late '90s-style consolidation."" Shell has long been seen as a potential buyer thanks to its healthy cash flow and relatively low oil price breakeven. The deal, which should generate pretax synergies of around 2.5 billion pounds per year, will result in BG shareholders owning around 19 percent of the combined group. Last year, BG Chairman Gould hired CEO Helge Lund from Norway's Statoil (STL.OL) to turn around the company. Gould said on Wednesday Lund would remain the CEO through the transition. However, it was evident the deal was driven by Van Beurden, who took over as the CEO last year, and Gould, a veteran executive who previously ran oil services giant Schlumberger (SLB.N). ""I called Andrew up and we had a very good and constructive discussion about the idea and it very quickly seemed to make sense to both of us,"" Van Beurden told a conference call.

393,"  LONDON Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) agreed to buy smaller rival BG Group BG.L for 47 billion pounds ($70.2 billion) in the first major energy industry merger in more than a decade, closing the gap on market leader U.S. ExxonMobil (XOM.N) after a plunge in oil prices.Below are some tentative answers from analysts to questions arising from the deal.HOW EXPENSIVE IS $70 BILLION? BMO Capital Markets said Shell is paying 66.6 times BG's forecast earnings for 2016, although Shell itself was trading at only 12.1 times its forecast earnings for next year before the deal was announced.HOW MUCH WILL BANKS GET IN FEES? According to estimates from Thomson Reuters/Freeman Consulting, three banks advising on the Shell/BG Group deal could earn a combined $182.6 million in fees. Goldman Sachs and Robey Warshaw LLP are expected to earn $50.3 million each for advising BG, with Bank of America Merrill Lynch earning approximately $82.0 million advising Shell.WHY PAY SUCH A PREMIUM? Richard Gorry, director at JBC Energy Asia, said most of the world’s hydrocarbon resources which are easy to develop are in the hands of state-owned companies in the case of OPEC countries, or quasi state-owned companies in the case of Russia. ""The resources that are available to the international oil companies are very expensive to find and develop,"" he said.  WHAT NEXT? Baring Global Resources Fund said: ""We believe most other major oil companies are structurally underweight Brazil and U.S. onshore. Therefore, we believe that others need to follow Shell’s lead and invest in these regions."" WHAT DOES THE DEAL TELL US ABOUT OIL PRICES?  London Capital Group said: ""A Shell-BG tie-up will ignite talk of other potential deals in the battered oil and gas markets. Many will see the deal as marking the bottom of the energy price slump and encourage more investors back into these areas."" Henderson Global Investors said: ""In buying BG, Shell is making a bold strategic bet that oil prices will recover towards the $70-90 level in the medium term."" Oil prices fell towards $57 a barrel on Wednesday.WILL THE M&A FLOODGATE OPEN AFTER Shell DEAL? Wood Mackenzie said: ""Most of the big players are weighing up opportunistic acquisitions, but few have the means or appetite for deals anywhere near this scale. Most of the majors are hamstrung by near-term financial stretch, and Asian NOCs (national oil companies) are contending with growing political scrutiny of M&A strategy, past and future. If you're looking to the next big deal, ExxonMobil stands out as most likely to pull the trigger. Companies that are unloved by the market but big in strategic resource themes – U.S. tight oil, East Africa LNG, deepwater or frontier exploration – will be the focus of their attention. But don't expect a wave of late '90s-style consolidation."" WHO HAS DEEP POCKETS? Lombard Odder Global Energy Fund said: ""Only Exxon has the flexibility to do big ticket deals like (the BG Group purchase). In contrast Total, ENI and Statoil will have to content themselves with the pick 'n mix counter.”WHAT ARE THE MID TERM RISKS? Henderson Global Investors said: ""In the interim, Shell is taking on more risk in issuing more shares and also in paying out cash to BG shareholders. As a result their balance sheet will become more stretched. And this potentially puts some strain on this dividend as they redirect cash flows to paying down debt ahead of growing the dividend.""Barclays said: ""What will prove more difficult (for Shell) is in convincing its own shareholders that it can control capex of the combined entity and that the BG portfolio is capable of delivering the promised growth options beyond Brazil, something that, in our view, has been far from evident of late.""

394,"  (Adds details)LONDON, April 8 Royal Dutch Shell said on Wednesday it had agreed to buy BG Group for 47 billion pounds ($70 billion) in a bid to close the gap on the world's biggest oil major, U.S. ExxonMobil.In a joint statement, the two firms said that as part of the recommended deal Shell would pay a mix of cash and shares that would value each BG share at around 1,350 pence. It said this represented a premium of around 52 percent to the 90-day trading average.The deal, which should generate pre-tax synergies of around 2.5 billion pounds per year, will result in BG shareholders owning around 19 percent of the combined group. Setting out its longer-term thinking, the two groups said Shell would pay a dividend of $1.88 per ordinary share in 2015 and at least the same amount in 2016. Anglo-Dutch Shell also expects to start a share buyback programme in 2017 of at least $25 billion for the period 2017 to 2020.Shell said the deal would boost its proved oil and gas reserves by 25 percent, and give it better prospects in new projects, particularly in Australia LNG and Brazil deep water. Shell also said it planned to increase asset sales to $30 billion between 2016-2018 on the back of the deal. The company said in January it was selling $5-6 billion worth of assets per year.($1 = 0.6748 pounds)   (Reporting by Kate Holton; editing by Paul Sandle)",2015-04-08,XOM,"Wed Apr 8, 2015 | 2:28am EDT",UPDATE 1-Shell agrees $70 billion deal to buy BG,http://www.reuters.com//article/bg-group-ma-shell-recommendation-idUSL5N0X50HI20150408?type=companyNews
395,"   By Narottam Medhora and Dmitry Zhdannikov  Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) is in advanced talks to buy BG Group BG.L in the first oil super-merger in more than a decade, seeking to extend its lead in gas production and close the gap with the world's biggest oil major, U.S. ExxonMobil (XOM.N).BG, which has a market value of $46 billion, said in a statement on Tuesday it was in advanced discussions regarding a possible offer by Shell, whose market capitalisation is $202 billion. Exxon is worth $360 billion.A successful deal would give Shell access to BG's multi-billion dollar projects in Brazil, East Africa, Australia, Kazakhstan and Egypt, including some of the world's most ambitious liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects.The collapse in global oil prices has sparked much speculation about mergers in the industry and BG has often been cited as a potential target. An agreement would mark the biggest announced deal globally this year. In terms of oil and gas mega mergers, it would be the world's fourth largest since 1996 when BG's net debt of about $12 billion is included, according to Thomson Reuters data.The talks come as BG, Britain's third-largest energy company by market value, has been plagued by delayed payments in Egypt,  written $6 billion off the value of it oil and gas business and seen an 8 percent decline in annual net earnings. It has also cut capital expenditure by as much as 36 percent this year. BG said Shell must announce a firm intention to make an offer by May 5 or announce that it does not intend to make an offer. ""There can be no certainty that any offer will ultimately be made for BG,"" it said.BG shares have tumbled nearly 28 percent since mid-June, when the slump in global oil prices started. That compares with a 17.2 percent decline in the FTSE All Share Oil and Gas Index .FTASX0530 and a 3.3 percent fall for Shell's Amsterdam-listed shares. Shell, which declined to comment on the talks, has also felt the pain of the plunge in oil prices.Although profits for the last quarter of 2014 climbed, it missed forecasts by more than 20 percent, with Shell blaming writedowns and foreign exchange losses for making almost no money in oil production, its most powerful unit. It has also  announced a three-year $15 billion spending cut.MEGA MERGER  The halving in crude prices on the back of a shale oil boom in the United States and a decision by Saudi Arabia not to cut production has created an environment similar to the early 2000s when many super-mergers took place.Back then, oil major BP (BP.L) acquired rival Amoco and Arco, Exxon bought Mobil and Chevron (CVX.N) merged with Texaco.While the talks represent a rare mega-merger opportunity, the UK-based producer has problems which could complicate a deal, bankers familiar with BG's operations have said. ""Brazil is certainly a drag on any transaction,"" said a London-based banker, referring to an investigation in Brazil into corruption charges involving state champion Petrobras that is delaying oilfield projects. BG has, however, not reported any delays. Problems in Egypt, where the government has delayed payments to oil and gas firms amid almost three years of instability, forced the company to rush in former Statoil A/S (STL.OL) CEO Helge Lund in February, nearly a month ahead of schedule.The company is also heavily invested in LNG projects, that have assumed high prices. But LNG has fallen more sharply than oil, with Asian spot prices down almost two thirds in the last year.The industry as a whole has also developed too many projects set to come onstream in the next few years, likely to cause a glut and an price collapse several years down the road, analysts have said.Discussions were first reported by the Wall Street Journal, which cited sources familiar with the matter. (on.wsj.com/1FcKGGY).In a sign that Lund is beefing up expertise for the talks with Shell, BG poached two officials from Statoil, including Katie Jackson, who was responsible for mergers and acquisitions ($1 = 0.6749 pounds) (Reporting by Narottam Medhora and Sai Sachin R in Bengaluru, Additional reporting by Greg Roumeliotis and Denny Thomas; Writing by Denny Thomas; Editing by Savio D'Souza, Bernard Orr and Edwina Gibbs)",2015-04-08,XOM,"Wed Apr 8, 2015 | 12:52am EDT",Shell seeking to buy BG in first oil super-merger in over a decade,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-bg-group-m-a-shell-idUSKBN0MY22E20150408?type=companyNews

397,"  TOKYO, April 9 Exxon Mobil Corp has reduced its stake in Japan's second-biggest oil refiner by capacity, TonenGeneral Sekiyu KK , to 9.9 percent from 11.6 percent, the Japanese firm said on Thursday.The move, which took effect on Thursday, will not in any way change TonenGeneral's existing tie-up with Exxon Mobil, a spokesman for the Japanese firm said, adding that Exxon still remains its largest shareholder.The stake sale was worth around 6.4 billion yen ($53 million) based on the closing price of TonenGeneral's shares on Thursday. TonenGeneral, formerly a unit of Exxon Mobil, in 2012 bought a controlling stake in itself from Exxon in a roughly $4 billion deal, reducing Exxon's stake from 50 percent to 22 percent as the oil major pulls back due to declining Japanese oil demand. Exxon Mobil further reduced its stake in TonenGeneral by about 10 percent in 2014, by selling it to trading house Mitsui & Co.

398,"  (Adds details, background, comment from GasTerra/NAM)By Toby SterlingAMSTERDAM, April 15 Dutch gas production company NAM and national gas trading company GasTerra said on Wednesday they were studying how to compensate for a court ruling that halted production at part of the massive Groningen gas field because of safety concerns.A spokesman for GasTerra said it was not yet clear whether his organisation may have to purchase additional gas on the open market, or whether NAM may be able to increase production in other areas to make up for the production halt around the town of Loppersum.""Yes we do think we can meet all our contractual obligations, so in that sense the court ruling doesn't change much,"" Anton Buijs said.""What does change is where does the gas come from"" he said. Production at the Groningen gas field, Europe's largest, has been increasingly under fire since the Dutch Safey Board censored the government in February for failing to take into account adequately the risk the small earthquakes it causes pose to citizens of Groningen.GasTerra, which buys and sells all the gas produced by NAM and a number of smaller Dutch fields, also purchases some of its supplies from the TTF trading hub, where Norwegian and Russian gas are also traded.Buijs noted that fields around Loppersum, which make up about 9 percent of Groningen production, have already pumped one billion cubic meters (bcm) of gas this year, one third of their budgeted output in 2015 before the court ruling. In a letter to parliament on Wednesday, Economic Affairs Minister Henk Kamp said NAM may have to make ""operational adjustments"" in other areas to compensate for the Loppersum halt.NAM spokesman Ernst Moeksis declined to say whether that would mean increasing production in other areas of Groningen, which is possible under the court ruling but would be unpopular in Groningen -- and politically sensitive in The Hague. GasTerra spokesman Buijs said other possibilities include a mix of increasing purchases from Norway or Russia, using stored gas if necessary, and increasing purchases from many small Dutch fields outside Groningen.And the court's ruling doesn't exclude the possibility of restarting production at Loppersum in an emergency, he added.NAM (Nederlandse Aardolie Maatschappij) is a joint venture between Royal Dutch Shell and Exxon Mobil.The national gas trading company GasTerra, half owned by the Dutch state and half owned by NAM, said GasTerra, NAM and government-owned grid operator GasUnie would discuss the next steps on Wednesday.(Reporting By Toby Sterling; additional reporting by Anthony Deutsch; Editing by David Goodman and David Evans)",2015-04-15,XOM,"Wed Apr 15, 2015 | 7:37am EDT",UPDATE 1-Exxon-Shell gas venture may have to adjust Groningen output after ruling,http://www.reuters.com//article/shell-exxon-groningen-idUSL5N0XC2BH20150415?type=companyNews

400,"   By Oleg Vukmanovic , Dmitry Zhdannikov and Jacob Gronholt-Pedersen | MILAN/LONDON/SINGAPORE  MILAN/LONDON/SINGAPORE Anadarko Petroleum is considering selling its multi-billion dollar stake in Mozambique's giant gas reserves, with Exxon Mobil and Qatar Petroleum [QATPE.UL] both showing interest, banking and industry sources said. Exxon is seen as the front runner, and it would be its first big acquisition since the oil price collapse. The world's largest oil firm has been expected to follow the example of Royal Dutch Shell, which agreed to buy BG Group for $70 billion last week.Anadarko, which has opened its data rooms to investors keen to get a more detailed picture of its reserves, could sell up to its full 26.5 percent stake in Mozambique's offshore Area 1 license in the Rovuma Basin, the sources said.The last stake sold, 10 pct, went for $2.64 billion in 2013 to India's ONGC, but that was seen as overpriced and oil and gas prices have since fallen sharply, making it hard to value Anadarko's remaining asset.  Area 1 holds over 75 trillion cubic feet of recoverable gas, enough to meet over four years of total European gas demand.Anadarko initially planned to build a major liquefied natural gas (LNG) export project in Mozambique fed by Area 1 reserves and targeting Asian markets, but the sale process calls that into question and suggests the task will pass to whoever picks up the stake. Exxon, which operates a diverse LNG portfolio, is the likely front-runner after Shell dropped out following its planned merger with BG Group, which will give it access to large gas assets in neighboring Tanzania, according to one senior oil banker.Three other sources said Exxon and Qatar Petroleum had visited Anadarko's data rooms to get a closer look at reserve breakdowns and reservoir geology. An Exxon Mobil spokesman said: ""We never comment on speculation or potential business opportunities.""Anadarko said it does not comment on market speculation, as did Shell. Qatar Petroleum, which is itself consolidating after the plunge in oil prices, did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.PRIZED ASSETS Plummeting oil prices may have pushed Anadarko to review one of its most prized assets, one of the sources said. But it is unclear if the Houston-based firm is in any hurry to reach a deal or if it plans to offload its full stake. ""There are variants"" as to how much it will sell, said a banker.It is not the first high-quality asset to go on the block. Last month Total put up part of its stake in the North Sea Laggan-Tormore oil and gas field to shed assets after the steep drop in oil prices.Oil and global gas prices have roughly halved since June last year, leading energy companies to cut spending and sell assets in order to boost their balance sheets. <LNG/>""This is a $100 billion development that needs developers with significant cash,"" one banker said, referring to the full long-term costs of developing the initial liquefaction plant as well as future planned capacity expansions. ""The Mozambique government realizes now that it needs to get a top player because if they get it wrong, the project can be delayed by five years,"" he added.Exxon Mobil's success in starting up its remote Papua New Guinea LNG export plant last year ahead of schedule and its subsequent rapid ramp-up may make it a desirable partner for Mozambique, which also lacks much basic infrastructure, sources said.There are also arguments in favor of QP.""This could represent a good move for QP, the size and quality of the resource is analogous to Qatar's North Field, there's potential to target multiple markets from east Africa, and since Qatar came late to the LNG opportunity in the U.S. it's a good alternative,"" the banker said.Already the world's biggest LNG exporter, Qatar faces rising competition from Australia, which is set to overtake it as the No. 1 producer this decade, and the United States where booming supply has prompted several LNG export schemes.

404,"   By Jonathan Stempel  Exxon Mobil Corp has agreed to pay $5.07 million to resolve allegations it violated the federal Clean Water Act and state environmental laws in connection with a 2013 oil spill in Arkansas, the U.S. Department of Justice and Environmental Protection Agency said on Wednesday.The March 29, 2013 spill occurred after the rupture of Exxon's Pegasus pipeline, causing about 3,190 barrels, or 134,000 gallons, of oil to flow through a residential neighborhood in Mayflower, Arkansas and nearby waterways including Lake Conway, which flows into the Arkansas River. Under a consent decree made public on Wednesday, Exxon will pay $4.19 million in federal and state civil penalties, $600,000 to improve water quality in Lake Conway, and $280,000 to cover Arkansas' litigation costs.

Exxon's annual payout grew nearly 10 percent in 2014.In recent months oil companies have been looking at all means of conserving cash, including cutting capital spending, as crude oil prices fell by more than half from a June high of more than $100 a barrel. Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson told analysts in March that the company's ""first layer of cash goes to the shareholder through the dividend,"" and said Exxon was committed to growing the payout. In February Exxon said it plans to slash its share buyback program in the first quarter by more than half to $1 billion.  It also cut its spending by about 12 percent this year.

416,"   By Rory Carroll | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO May 12 An explosion in February that shut the gasoline-making unit of Exxon Mobil's  Torrance refinery near Los Angeles is still pushing up regional gasoline prices, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said on Tuesday.Average retail prices for regular gasoline in California as a whole, and in Los Angeles specifically, have increased by 57 cents per gallon, and 63 cents per gallon, respectively, in the past three weeks while average U.S. prices have increased by 20 cents per gallon, said T. Mason Hamilton, an analyst with EIA.Reduced output from the Torrance facility has meant that disruptions at other refineries, like a flaring event at Chevron's Richmond refinery last month and maintenance at Tesoro's Anacortes refinery in Washington state, have had bigger-than-usual price impacts, he said.""Supply disruptions in the tightly balanced and relatively isolated California gasoline market have increased wholesale and retail gasoline prices over the past several weeks,"" Hamilton said in a post on the EIA website. ""The costs of adjusting supply sources, along with planned and unplanned refinery outages and delayed resupply, have contributed to the gasoline price increases,"" he said.Four employees suffered minor injuries in the explosion and production halted at the 100,000-barrel-per-day fluid catalytic cracker (FCC), a central gasoline-producing unit. An Exxon Mobil representative declined to comment Tuesday on the current status of the unit.Unlike other states, California does not have an extensive series of pipelines connecting it to other markets and relies heavily on its 14 in-state refineries to meet the state's sizable demand. A state also requires the use of more environmentally-friendly blend of gasoline, which also limits the availability of supply from other markets.When supply disruptions occur, the region can be resupplied in four ways, in-region inventories, marine movement from other West Coast refineries, marine movements from other U.S. regions and imports from outside the United States, such as Asia and Europe.Hamilton said imports of gasoline blending components to California refineries have risen in recent weeks as refineries attempt to produce more gasoline that meets the state's strict standards.

417,"  SINGAPORE May 12 ExxonMobil has begun ramping up production at a new Indonesian oilfield, targeting peak output later this year of more than 200,000 barrels per day (bpd) that will add to an already oversupplied crude market.Output from the Banyu Urip field, part of ExxonMobil's Cepu block in East Java, is crucial to Indonesia's long-term efforts to meet rising domestic demand as production declines at ageing fields in the former member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).""We continue to see strong capacity results on the Banyu Urip wells and will continue to ramp up production until we reach peak field production of more than 200,000 barrels per day, later in 2015,"" Erwin Maryoto, vice president of public and government affairs at ExxonMobil Indonesia, said in an e-mail response to questions late on Monday.The oilfield was producing 75,000 bpd at the end of last month, ExxonMobil said during a conference call on April 30. The Banyu Urip discovery in 2001 was one of the largest in Asia in the last 15 years, but disagreements between the U.S. oil major and Indonesia's state oil company Pertamina  slowed its development.The field will help Indonesia meet a target of producing some 830,000 bpd this year, up from output of just below 800,000 bpd in 2014. These figures are around half the country's peak production in the mid-1990s. Indonesia, an OPEC member until 2008, was once self-sufficient in oil and gas but has been struggling for years to attract investment to halt declining output. The country's energy minister said last week he would seek approval for the country to rejoin the oil cartel.The first shipment of Banyu Urip crude, was lifted from the Gagak Rimang offshore storage terminal in April jointly by Pertamina, local government interests and the Indonesian government, Maryoto said. Traders said they expect first exports from the field in the third quarter. The new production will add to a global oversupply of crude that triggered a drop in oil prices of more than 60 percent between June and January.Banyu Urip is a light to medium waxy crude with very low sulphur content that will yield good output of diesel, kerosene and vacuum gas oil, which is used to make gasoline, ExxonMobil said on its website.Recoverable resources at the field are estimated at more than 450 million barrels. At full production, Banyu Urip will be Indonesia's largest oil project, ExxonMobil said.

419,"  (Adds comments on vapor standards and recent derailment)By Ernest ScheyderWILLISTON, N.D. May 13 North Dakota posted a surprising jump in oil and natural gas output in March, as producers leaned on newer technologies and processes to offset a slump in commodity prices.Many industry observers had expected output to fall for the third consecutive month in the wake of a more than 50 percent drop in oil prices since last summer.""We scratched our heads in the month of March"" as to why production increased, Lynn Helms, director of the state's Department of Mineral Resources, said during a conference call with reporters.Yet the increase shows producers' willingness to wring efficiencies out of existing operations, as well as their attempt to maintain production, even at depressed prices, to safeguard relationships with service providers ahead of any future spike in crude oil prices. About 189 North Dakota wells were completed in March at locations owned by Exxon Mobil Corp, Hess Corp, Continental Resources Inc and ConocoPhillips, reversing a trend in which most producers delayed completions.""These four appear to be more in tune with having normal cash flow, and continue to complete their wells in a more aggressive manner,"" Helms said.But in a sign of divergent strategies in the No. 2 U.S. oil producing state, EOG Resources Inc and Marathon Oil Corp  continue to delay fracking. ""These two are going to hold onto completions as long as they legally can,"" Helms said. North Dakota producers have one year once drilling has finished to bring a well into production or face placing the well on an abandoned status.None of companies were available to comment. The state's oil producers pumped nearly 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) in March, up about 1 percent, or some 15,000 bpd, from February, according to the Department of Mineral Resources.The number of wells that had been drilled but not fracked, a metric commonly known as ""ducks,"" fell by 20 during March to 880, reversing a months-long trend that had concerned some in the industry.Helms said he only expects the state's drilling rig count to fall by one from 83 on Wednesday, though he added he does not expect the count to rise above 100 in the near future.Helms added that the effects of last week's crude-by-rail derailment were abrogated by new vapor pressure rules that were put in place during April.""We do think it helped,"" Helms said.

420,"  * Delayed restart of Exxon refinery draws down inventories* Valero and BP among traders shipping jet from Asia to U.S.* Asian jet fuel margin climbs to 1-week highBy Jessica JaganathanSINGAPORE, May 13 Asian jet fuel shipments to the United States West Coast region could pick up this month as a prolonged cut in throughput at a California refinery is drawing down inventories, traders said on Wednesday.Arbitrage economics to ship jet fuel from North Asia to the U.S. West Coast are now profitable, so there would be an increase in spot jet fuel cargoes on that route over the coming weeks, they said.Demand from the U.S. helped push up Asian jet fuel margins to a one-week high on Wednesday. An explosion in February that shut the gasoline-making unit of Exxon Mobil's Torrance 149,500 barrels-per-day (bpd)  refinery near Los Angeles reduced throughput at the refinery.This has pushed up gasoline prices which is prompting refineries in the U.S. west coast to produce more gasoline than jet fuel, in turn drawing down inventories for the latter and increasing import demand, one of them said.""The U.S. west coast prompt month market is strong and has been since middle of last week...I think the ExxonMobil incident and a delayed restart is causing it,"" a Singapore-based trader who is familiar with shipments on that route said. The distillate stocks, which include jet fuel, in the U.S. west coast slipped by nearly 4 percent to 13.901 million barrels in the week to May 1, latest data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration showed.Valero has tentatively fixed the ""Qi Lin Zuo"" to ship 60,000 tonnes of jet fuel from South Korea to the U.S. west coast for loading in late May, traders and shipbrokers said.Marubeni has tentatively fixed the High Progress to ship 40,000 tonnes of jet fuel from either South Korea or Bristol Bay headed to the U.S. west coast, though this could not be confirmed. At least two other cargoes are also due to be shipped from South Korea and Taiwan, including one by BP, they added.When the arbitrage economics are not profitable, typically only 1 or 2 vessels are shipped on that route, traders said.Shipments could slow once the firm demand starts driving up jet fuel prices in Asia, a Singapore-based jet fuel trader said.""(Arbitrage economics) are well workable if you have cargo on the water, so it's more for the prompt dates,"" he said.""If you buy the oil now and ship to the U.S. , by the time the cargo arrives in the U.S., the arbitrage might shut.""Still, with demand for jet fuel weak in Asia and supply ample with refineries largely back from maintenance, it might be a matter of which trade flow loses the least money, a second trader said.

Its oil trading arm, Aramco Trading, could soon find at least two thirds of its trading focused on products such as diesel, gasoline and heating oil rather than crude, Fesharaki said.Years of investment was designed to fuel the transport, air conditioning and power generation for the kingdom's economic growth. But as OPEC members fight for market share, Aramco's refineries also give it a natural outlet for its 10 million bpd of crude production.""In contrast with the crude market which is shrinking, the product market is becoming more global,"" said Antoine Halff, chief oil analyst with the International Energy Agency.The crude oil price rout this year catapulted refining to the fore; trading and refining last year soared to 60 percent of integrated oil companies' first quarter earnings, compared with 18 percent last year, according to Reuters calculations. GLOBAL REACH While crude oil producers who lack a developed refinery sector - such as Nigeria - effectively leave this money on the table for refiners, Aramco and others in the Gulf can now cash in. ""The crude is so cheap it's pretty much free for them,"" said Amrita Sen of Energy Aspects. ""The margins are going to be massive. It makes trade flows in products very different.""Other Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries members, including fellow Gulf states Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, have also boosted refining and added trading arms. But their refineries worldwide, hovering near 1 million bpd each, are only a fraction of what Aramco has built in just a few years.""The Saudis have a much wider market there because they are competing globally,"" Halff said. ""They diversify vertically by capturing different parts of the value chain and it becomes a hedge and it gives them a lot more market access.""Aramco has added more than 1 million bpd in capacity through a controlling stake in Korea's S-Oil as well as its two heavy hitting refineries at home, Yanbu and Yasref, both with 400,000 bpd in throughput. Jizan, due on in the Kingdom in 2018, would add a further 400,000 bpd.The growth puts Aramco's owned or equity stakes refining at 5.4 million bpd, at least 40 percent above a decade ago. Aramco itself markets more than 3 million bpd of that, tying it with Shell as the world's fourth largest oil refiner.The shift could also enable it to funnel more crude into its own plants, meaning the nine-year high of 7.89 million bpd it exported in March could be the high water mark. Already, it has turned down requests from China for extra crude.""The volume of crude being sold is still huge,"" Fesharaki said. ""But it shows the transformation in the next five years in which the companies become more of product players and will have automatically less of an influence on the crude market.""

425,"   By Anna Driver | HOUSTON  HOUSTON May 27 Progressive shareholders are pushing to add directors with climate change expertise to the boards of Exxon Mobil Corp and Chevron Corp, arguing the largest U.S. oil companies need more depth of knowledge to navigate environmental issues.Climate and greenhouse gas proposals regularly surface at oil company annual meetings, but Wednesday will be the first time shareholders at Exxon will vote on putting an independent climate expert on the board.The measure will also be voted on at Chevron's annual meeting on Wednesday after being rejected by an average of 77 percent of votes cast in previous years.Boards of both companies oppose the idea, which has the support of influential proxy advisory service Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. Oil companies, while acknowledging the need to address climate change risks, have said it will take decades to develop technologies that economically capture carbon emissions. In January, Europe's Royal Dutch Shell Plc backed a measure from activist investors asking it to be more proactive about planning for climate change.""Just one authoritative figure with acknowledged expertise and standing could perform a valuable role in ways that would enable the board to more effectively address the environmental issues and risks inherent in its present business model regarding climate change,"" said the proposal for Exxon. Father Mike Crosby, who lives in a community of Roman Catholic friars in Milwaukee, is sponsoring the proposal at Exxon. He said he is tired of pressing for more accountability on climate issues at the Irving, Texas company.""If they had done something 20 years ago we could have a different world right now,"" Crosby said in an interview. Crosby, whose church group owns about 300 Exxon shares, said his efforts to talk to Exxon directors about climate were rebuffed so he proposed the addition of a climate expert to the board.Alan Jeffers, a spokesman for Exxon, said in an email that Father Crosby will have an opportunity to press his case in front of the board at the annual meeting.Exxon said in its proxy that board members have a broad range of expertise, including environmental and climate experience.Chevron's board said ""its current membership possesses significant environmental experience and that each board member should possess a broad range of skills,"" according to its proxy filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

426,"  (Adds comments from Exxon, Chevron)By Ron Bousso and Susanna TwidaleLONDON, June 1 Europe's top oil and gas companies urged governments around the world to introduce a pricing system for carbon emissions, as governments meet in Bonn, Germany, on Monday to work on a U.N. deal to fight climate change.Criticised for not doing enough to tackle climate change, the chief executives of BG Group, BP, Eni , Royal Dutch Shell, Statoil and France's Total said carbon pricing ""would reduce uncertainty and encourage the most cost-effective ways of reducing carbon emissions widely.""In a joint statement, the companies acknowledged ""the current trend"" in greenhouse gas emissions is too high to meet the United Nation's target for limiting global warming by no more than 2 degrees.""Our industry faces a challenge: we need to meet greater energy demand with less CO2. We are ready to meet that challenge and we are prepared to play our part,"" the leaders of the six companies said.""We firmly believe that carbon pricing will discourage high carbon options and reduce uncertainty that will help stimulate investments in the right low-carbon technologies and the right resources at the right pace.""NOTABLE ABSENTEES  U.S. oil majors ExxonMobil and Chevron chose not to take part in the initiative, an industry source said.Exxon said it was aware of the letter. Like Chevron, Exxon said it works with the International Petroleum Industry Environmental Conservation Association (IPIECA), a trade group, to develop a common position for climate change mitigation.""It's clear that there is a difference of views on each side of the Atlantic,"" Patrick Pouyanne, Total's Chief Executive, told reporters during a news briefing.He said he and his counterparts from BP, Shell and Statoil had once met at a roundtable in Oslo and agreed on the European initiative.""Instead of waiting for the smallest common denominator, we got convinced it was worth making a commitment as European oil majors, as we command a significant share of the oil market, without necessarily waiting for an American to come on board."" Pouyanne said he was in talks with the two U.S. oil majors however and that he hoped that one of them would join the European initiative quickly.In May, Ken Cohen, Exxon's head of public policy, wrote a blog that said a ""revenue-neutral carbon tax,"" a scheme that shares similarities with carbon pricing, would be better at reducing greenhouse gas emissions than mandates.The letter from the European companies was first published by the Financial Times on Sunday.Climate Group, a non-profit advocacy, urged the world's biggest economies to respond positively to the initiative. ""This is a symbolic moment, and demonstrates an important if not universal shift. It reflects a growing realisation within influential sectors of the fossil fuel industry of a need to adapt to both market and climate realities,"" Mark Kenber, Climate Group chief executive, said in a statement.Setting a price for each ton of carbon that emitters produce is meant to encourage companies to adopt cleaner technologies and shift away from using fossil fuels, primarily coal.China is the world's biggest carbon emitter.The U.N. and World Bank have been strong advocates for policies that shift the responsibility to polluters to pay for carbon emissions.""Business used to wait for governments for policy perfection, they are no longer waiting. They are moving forward, providing support and encouragement to national and international actions, because addressing climate change is their best policy for business continuity,"" Christiana Figueres, head of the U.N. climate change secretariat, said at a carbon market event in Barcelona last week.According to a report published by the World Bank last week 40 nations and over 20 cities, states and regions now have a price on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, covering around 12 percent of annual global greenhouse gas emissions, or the equivalent of nearly 7 billion tonnes of CO2.The value of global schemes to price carbon, including trading schemes and taxes, totaled almost $50 billion as of April 1, the World Bank said.Governments from more than 190 nations from June 1 to June 11 will work towards streamlining a draft text of a U.N. deal to fight climate change due to be agreed in Paris in December.

427,"   By Dmitry Zhdannikov and Shadia Nasralla | VIENNA, June 3  VIENNA, June 3 Six months after OPEC upended oil markets and sent prices crashing, the head of U.S. oil giant ExxonMobil has an unusual message for the cartel: thanks.While Exxon and other large oil companies have been forced to slash spending, cut staff and sacrifice tens of billions of dollars in revenue as oil prices halved, they have also watched with quiet satisfaction as upstart rivals from the U.S. shale patch struggle simply to survive through the downturn.The price collapse has helped shine a sharper light on the highest-cost producers, Rex Tillerson, head of the world's largest publicly traded oil company, told a rare meeting of oil executives and OPEC ministers.""We're trying to discover where the marginal barrels are around the world. It's important for all of us to know,"" he said. ""We are constantly chasing the price against the cost of supply.""""We live with a lot of uncertainty and we're rewarded for how well we manage it,"" said Tillerson, one of the best-paid CEOs in the world. If you can't live with uncertainty, ""be a librarian"", he said.OPEC decided against cutting its oil production last year to fight for market share with non-OPEC producers, thus aggravating a global oil glut that arose due to a shale boom in the United States. The group is expected to maintain that policy on Friday at its first meeting since the November decision. Oil prices crashed to as low as $46 per barrel by early 2015 from as much as $115 in mid-2014.Prices have recovered to around $65 per barrel in recent weeks on fears that oil companies have reduced investments too quickly and too steeply, which might result in project delays and reduced output.Tillerson has repeatedly said the downturn was a time of opportunities to acquire rivals, although Exxon has yet to emulate a megadeal done by rival Royal Dutch Shell in April to acquire smaller competitor BG for $70 billion. Tillerson also urged against excessive cuts amid a low oil price environment - be it capital spending or staff: ""We are chasing a moving target (oil price). We always overshoot in both directions - on the way up and on the way down"".OPEC ministers and delegates said they saw prices rising further to $70-80 per barrel, but not all CEOs agree.The head of oil major BP, Bob Dudley, said he saw softness in prices in the second half of 2015 as global supply outpaces demand. Weak prices might be what companies such as Exxon and BP need if they want to expand.""If we stay lower for longer, we might see more activity in M&A (mergers and acquisitions),"" Dudley said.But besides the consolidatory impact, low oil prices could also encourage some substantial changes such as previously unheard-of partnerships between operators.""We have always shared risk and reward through equity partnerships but we need to be more creative to keep pushing back frontiers in a $60 world,"" Dudley said.The head of French oil company Total, Patrick Pouyanne, said he was confident technology would achieve further breakthroughs to allow the U.S. shale oil industry to increase output even in an environment of low oil prices.Asked whether he had a target price in mind for U.S. shale or Total's operations in general, Pouyanne said: ""We have a margin - not a target price. I'm not crazy to bet on one target price"".

428,"  * U.S. and European majors have held talks for joint initiative Exxon wants carbon tax to be revenue-neutral* European majors acted together more quicklyLONDON, June 3 The failed attempt by the world's oil majors to speak on climate change action with one voice has laid bare disagreement between U.S. and European companies on putting a price on carbon.The world's top oil companies have struggled for years to form a joint front in the face of growing criticism for not taking leadership against climate change.This week's letter calling for a global carbon pricing by Europe's Statoil, Total, BP, Shell  as well as ENI and BG showed first signs of such an agreement, albeit without the support of U.S. peers Exxon Mobil and Chevron.Setting a price for each tonne of carbon that emitters produce is meant to encourage companies to adopt cleaner technologies and shift away from using fossil fuels, primarily coal.""While we have had discussions with European majors, and we wish them well, we don't believe we need to join this scheme,"" said Exxon Mobil Vice-President Robert Franklin at an industry conference in Paris on Tuesday. Another source confirmed Chevron had also been approached to join the initiative but that there was no enthusiam for the proposal, saying a domestic U.S. agreement on carbon pricing was still ""light years"" away.Nonetheless, Exxon Chief Executive Rex Tillerson said at an OPEC seminar in Vienna on Wednesday if a carbon tax was imposed it had to be revenue-neutral as most economies around the world are unable to shoulder the cost burden of a carbon tax.Separately, Chevron and Exxon both work with trade group International Petroleum Industry Environmental Conservation Association (IPIECA) to develop a common position for climate change mitigation.The IPIECA said on Tuesday it will put out a consensus view from its members on carbon pricing later this month. ""ALL IN IT TOGETHER"" For Europe's oil majors, under growing pressure to act against climate change, introducing carbon price systems where they are lacking is a more pressing issue. At home, they are already subject to the European Trading System that puts a market price on every tonne of carbon emitted and ties national governments to legally binding targets to reduce emissions.""We got together as a group in Europe very quickly and made a lot of progress in a short period of time,"" said BP Chief Executive Bob Dudley at the same event.After months of discussions that started at the World Economic Forum in Davos in January and continued at a roundtable meeting of chief executives in Oslo, the European companies' joint statement was finally agreed at last month's meeting of the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative (OGCI) in Paris, a forum for oil majors created last year ahead of UN climate talks this December, sources said.""There's a recognition that we're all in this together to support carbon pricing as an element of working towards fighting against climate change,"" said another source at one of the companies involved.Total Chief Executive Pouyanne said he was still in talks with the two U.S. majors and that he hoped one of them would join the European initiative soon.The OGCI, which includes oil companies from across the globe, is expected in the coming months to release a report on the group's action plan to combat climate change, sources said.

432,"  CARACAS Venezuela on Tuesday demanded that neighboring Guyana halt oil exploration being carried out by Exxon Mobil Corp in disputed offshore territory in an escalation of a long-running border dispute between the two South American nations. Exxon last month said it found oil off Guyana's coast, spurring complaints from Caracas that Guyana is unfairly exploiting a disputed territory that must be negotiated through a mechanism created via a 1966 treaty signed in Geneva.""Until there is a resolution of the issue of territorial reclamation ... there can be no unilateral use of these waters,"" Foreign Minister Delcy Rodriguez said in televised comments. ""The new government of Guyana shows a dangerous political provocation against a peaceful Venezuela, supported by the imperial power of an American transnational, Exxon Mobil,"" she said, referring to Guyanese authorities elected in May. Exxon has said it has no comment on the bilateral dispute.The sparsely populated and dense jungle area known as the Essequibo encompasses an area equivalent to around two-thirds of Guyanese territory. It functions in practice as part of Guyana and shows no discernable trace of Venezuelan influence. Guyana says Caracas agreed to relinquish the Essequibo following a ruling by an international tribunal in 1899, but that Venezuela later backtracked on that decision.

437,"  June 10 Clean-up costs associated with a Californian oil pipeline rupture that dumped as much as 2,400 barrels of crude onto a pristine stretch of coastline and into the Pacific Ocean have exceeded $60 million, the Los Angeles Times reported on Wednesday.Plains All American Pipeline spokeswoman Meredith Mathews told the newspaper that expenses for restoring the affected area near Santa Barbara ran as high as $3 million a day.Mathews added that the total, which did not include financial damage claims from people or businesses that may have been affected by the spill, were likely to increase as clean-up efforts continued. Representatives for the pipeline did not immediately respond to requests from Reuters for comment. The May 19 pipeline rupture prompted the closure of two popular beaches and a ban on fishing and shellfish harvesting. Officials said on Tuesday that about 75 percent of the 96.5 miles (155 km) of shoreline surveyed had met clean-up goals.

440,"  * Rosneft postponed second well drilling from 2015* First well drilled with help of ExxonMobil* Sources say work unlikely to resume before 2018* Sechin promises to keep output stable in 2015-2017   (Adds details, quotes, background, combines stories)By Vladimir Soldatkin and Denis PinchukST PETERSBURG, Russia, June 17 Rosneft  is working on schedule in the Arctic Kara Sea, where it drilled the first well last year, CEO Igor Sechin said, but declined to say when it would resume operations in the area seen as Russia's next oil province.Sources told Reuters last week that the state oil producer  would be forced to postpone drilling a second well in the Kara for at least two more years, a result of Western sanctions on Russia over the Ukraine crisis.Rosneft, the world's top listed oil firm by output, drilled a first exploration well known as Universitetskaya-1 last year in the Kara Sea, part of the Arctic Ocean, with the help of U.S. partner ExxonMobil which provided the rig.Sechin, a close ally of President Vladimir Putin, on Wednesday declined to say when the second well would be drilled.""No projects have been derailed. Let's not aggravate the situation around the offshore,"" Sechin said, when asked on resuming work there. ""I am telling you once again - let's not run ahead of ourselves... Sometimes adjustments are needed but this is not linked to anything.""Rosneft, in which BP owns almost a 20 percent stake,  had already delayed the drilling of the second well from 2015, after it failed to find a rig on time. It had said that the first well held light oil and that the field could hold 130 million tonnes of technically recoverable oil reserves.EXXON'S PARTNERSHIP  Exxon, whose CEO is not among participants listed on the website of the St Petersburg International Economic Forum due to start on Thursday, is a leading shareholder with another project, Sakhalin-1, in which Rosneft also has a stake.In April, Exxon lodged a claim against Russia at the Stockholm arbitrage court as part of a tax dispute over Sakhalin-1.Exxon believed it had overpaid taxes on profits from Sakhalin-1, in which it owns a 30 percent stake, and was seeking a tax cut and reimbursement of some taxes already paid, according to local media.Sechin said he hoped an amicable settlement will be found and the dispute will not affect relations between the partners, including with the Russian government, or the project itself.""Exxon is defending the project's interests in general, we are part of this project... This (Exxon's suit) was a forced position as it is obliged to defend (Sakhalin-1) shareholders, the economic regime of the project,"" Sechin said. Russia reduced the profit tax in 2009 to 20 percent for production-sharing agreements such as Exxon's Sakhalin-1 but Exxon continued to pay at an earlier rate of 35 percent after the project broke even in 2008.Other participants in Sakhalin-1, which is operated under a production sharing agreement, are Japan's Sodeco and India's ONGC.Earlier on Wednesday, Sechin told Rosneft shareholders at the company's annual general meeting that it planned to keep its hydrocarbon production stable in 2015-2017.""The business plan envisages a stable production level in 2015-2017 with the potential for an increase of 2 percent if market conditions are favourable,"" Sechin said, without elaborating.Sechin added that Rosneft planned to produce 252 million tonnes of oil equivalent this year. He did not give a breakdown for oil and gas.In 2014, Rosneft oil production reached 205 million tonnes (4.1 million barrels per day), compared to 4.2 million barrels per day in 2013.Speaking in St Petersburg, Sechin said Rosneft planned to invest 300-350 billion roubles ($5.6-$6.5 billion) into new large upstream projects in 2015-2017.Rosneft planned to ship around 40 percent of its exports to Asia by 2019, Sechin also said.

441,"  (Updates with details from conference call)June 18 PBF Energy Inc agreed to buy the 189,000 barrel-a-day Chalmette, Louisiana, refinery for $322 million from Exxon Mobil Corp and Petroleos de Venezuela SA, marking the New Jersey-based company's Gulf Coast debut.PBF shares jumped 17 percent to $31.04. The transaction is expected to close by year-end and boost 2016 earnings by 20 percent.The purchase marks an expansion beyond the eastern United States by the independent oil refiner, a move long awaited by investors. PBF had looked at the Texas City Refinery in 2011, while the plant was owned by BP Plc.The Chalmette refinery ""has tremendous hardware capabilities,"" said Paul Davis, senior vice president of PBF. The plant is equipped to run crude from around the world, he said.PBF will maintain a supply contract with Venezuela, but will look ""quickly"" to widen its crude slate, CEO Tom Nimbly said.The company will also look to increase the refinery's throughput of light-sweet crude from about 40,000 bpd to up to 60,000 bpd, Nimbly said. The refinery runs both light and heavy crudes, with about one-third of its throughput coming from Venezuela, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.In the first quarter, the refinery imported an average of 73,000 bpd of crude from Venezuela, or about 10 percent of all U.S. imports from the country, according to the EIA.The cost per complexity barrel, a key metric in evaluating refinery sales, is roughly $160, the company said, less than half of the average valuation of the past 12 years. That means PBF paid less for the ability to convert heavy grades of crude oil to products like gasoline. The Chalmette plant, built in 1915, sits on 400 acres (160 hectares) of a former plantation in Louisiana and is the largest employer in St. Bernard Parish, with about 1,000 employees and contractors, according to Exxon.Chalmette is PBF's first refinery purchase since 2011, when the company bought the 160,000 bpd Toledo, Ohio, plant from Sunoco Inc for $400 million.In 2010, it bought Valero Energy Corp's 160,000 bpd Paulsboro, New Jersey, refinery for $360 million and Valero's 182,200 bpd Delaware City, Delaware, plant for $220 million. ""I have been involved in many refinery acquisitions over the past 30 years. This certainly is one of the best from both an earnings and a value perspective,"" PBF Executive Chairman O'Malley said in a conference call Thursday.PBF is O'Malley's third U.S. independent refining company focused on buying plants at low prices.The company can move some purchased assets into a master-limited partnership, which makes the deal appealing, said Roger Read, an analyst with Wells Fargo.Hit by a recession and lower oil prices, Venezuela's government is raising money to cover hefty debt payments and spending ahead of a year-end parliamentary election.PDVSA also owns three U.S. refineries and 48 oil terminals through its Citgo unit. Venezuela put Citgo on the block in a separate transaction a year ago, but canceled the auction in January.

""This will be a stable organisation going forward."" He declined to reveal the scope of the staff cuts or the current number of the company's employees, but said no Qatari citizens had been let go, only foreigners. Before the restructuring, industry sources told Reuters that QP had around 14,000 employees.QP, which develops and operates oil and gas fields, a refinery and industrial complexes, will exit non-core areas such as insurance, catering and service companies, Kaabi added. ""Today we have incubated them, they have grown...so it's best to focus on our core business, oil and gas.""Earlier this year, QP said it was absorbing its wholly owned subsidiary Qatar Petroleum International, which was formed in 2007 as a foreign investment arm, into the parent firm. Over the past few years, QPI had created about 10 joint ventures in the United States, Britain, Italy, Singapore, Egypt and elsewhere. Super-rich Qatar is riding out the current period of low energy prices more comfortably than other Gulf countries, but it has still seen a plunge in its state revenues and has been looking at ways to cut costs and rationalise spending.Its foreign trade surplus shrank 52 percent from a year ago to 14.94 billion riyals ($4.10 billion) in April, while the value of exports of petroleum gases and other gaseous hydrocarbons fell 40 percent to 15.69 billion riyals.Kaabi said, however, that QP was proceeding with a project to add export capabilities to a liquefied natural gas import terminal in Sabine Pass, Texas. The project is a partnership with affiliates of Exxon Mobil Corp.Engineering and design work is underway and construction of the liquefaction plant is to start next year, he said.

Current output from Exxon's shuttered platforms was estimated at about 30,000 barrels per day, a small fraction of California's daily crude diet of around 1.7 million bpd.Although Exxon's processing center at Las Flores Canyon has a permitted capacity of 140,000 bpd for crude, its output has been in decline.

452,"  (Adds names of partners in initial paragraphs and details in paragraphs four, five and eight)CALGARY, Alberta, June 26 Imperial Oil Ltd  said on Friday it and partners Exxon Mobil Corp  and BP Plc need more time before they can drill an exploratory well in Canadian Arctic waters and are seeking an extension to their exploration license in the region.Pius Rolheiser, a spokesman for Imperial, said the license for the group's exploration parcel in the Beaufort Sea, a section of the Arctic Ocean, expires in 2020.He said the group is asking the Canadian government for a seven-year extension so it can complete the requirements of the regulatory process and have adequate time to make a decision on how, or when, it will drill a well in the region. ""There's a significant amount of work between where we are today and where we would need to be if we were to drill a well by 2020,"" Rolheiser said. ""It's our belief the current license term provided insufficient time to do the work we believe necessary.""The decision is the latest blow to northern Canadian hopes for a new exploration boom in the Beaufort, and for drillers looking to wend new projects through the complicated regulatory regime in Canada's Arctic. The region, including the Mackenzie River Delta, could hold more than 1.36 billion barrels of oil, according to estimates by Canada's National Energy Board, but only a handful of wells have been drilled there since the 1980s. Imperial is the second oil company to put aside plans to drill in the Canadian Beaufort in the past year. But while Imperial is deferring its drilling operation, Chevron Corp  said in December it has shelved its plan for a Beaufort well because of the ""economic uncertainty"" brought about by falling oil prices.Rolheiser said Imperial has written to regulators to explain its decision and that it is still committed to carrying out exploration work in the Beaufort.Imperial and Exxon each have a 25 percent stake in the Beaufort license while BP holds the remaining 50 percent share. The partners have two exploration properties in the region about 125 kilometers (78 miles) northwest of Tuktoyuktuk, in Canada's Northwest Territories.

454,"   By Luciana Otoni | BRASILIA, July 2  BRASILIA, July 2 Brazil's government expects a bill ending state-run Petrobras' dominant role in key offshore oil areas to pass Congress, reversing one of President Dilma Rousseff's signature policies, a source told Reuters on Thursday.The bill, which is before Brazil's Senate, is likely to pass and also win approval in the Chamber of Deputies, Brazil's lower house, said the source, who works at the Presidential Palace and has direct knowledge of government thinking.""There's nothing the government can do,"" said the source, who asked for anonymity because permission to speak with the press had not been given. ""It knows it can't stop this defeat.""The bill will amend a 2010 law requiring all new development in the offshore ""Subsalt Polygon"" to be handled by Petrobras or groups where Petrobras has a minimum 30 percent financial stake and final say in contracting and scheduling as group ""operator."" The current law doesn't block companies such as Exxon Mobil Corp and BP Plc from investing in the subsalt but companies prefer to act as operator when their own money is at stake.The government will push for an amendment giving Petrobras the right of first refusal over any new Subsalt Polygon developments, Delcídio Amaral, Workers' Party leader in the senate, said recently. The Polygon covers most of the Campos and Santos Basins east and south of Rio de Janeiro, where an estimated 50 to 100 billion barrels of oil and equivalent natural gas are trapped far beneath the seabed by a layer of mineral salts.The size of the resource, enough to supply all the needs of the United States for 7 to 14 years, led Rousseff and her predecessor Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva to seek greater control over its development. Since the 2010 law was passed, though, Brazil's oil industry has slowed. Since November, Petrobras activity has ground to a near halt in the wake of falling world oil prices, a giant corruption scandal, and crippling debt.Petrobras Chief Executive Aldemir Bendine said in May that the company lacks the finances to make the minimum 30 percent investment in subsalt projects. Meanwhile Brazil's shipyards and oil-service companies have fallen on hard times.The bill's author, Jose Serra, is opposed to giving Petrobras right of first refusal, saying such a move would reduce the auction price for the government.The new investment will also help kick-start a sluggish Brazilian economy, supporters say.

458,"  * $54 bln Australian LNG project is world's most expensive* Gorgon has suffered cost overruns, competition from U.S. shale* Test exports of LNG due to start late this year* Some Japanese clients say no plan to take these shipmentsBy Oleg Vukmanovic  and Osamu TsukimoriMILAN/TOKYO, July 8 Chevron's $54 billion Gorgon LNG project - the world's most expensive - may be forced to dump chunks of its early production onto an already saturated global spot market, as some Japanese clients warn they are unlikely to take up test shipments.This would be another blow for a project hit by billions of dollars in cost overruns and underscores the difficulties for a raft of Australian liquefied natural gas developments facing subdued demand and competition from U.S. shale gas.After nearly five years of construction, test exports of LNG from Gorgon's 15.6 million-tonnes-a-year (mtpa) plant off western Australia are due to begin late this year and last until April 2016, when commercial deliveries will likely start.Japanese buyers holding long-term supply contracts have in the past eagerly sought early cargoes, but some could pass on the test shipments with long-term prices well above spot prices languishing at four-year lows.""At this point there is no plan,"" a spokesman at Tokyo Gas  said, when asked whether it planned to take the first of the test, or commissioning, cargoes.The firm has a contract to take 1.1 mtpa from the project.A senior official from another Japanese client also said it was unlikely to buy these cargoes.""If there's spot supply that's cheaper than Chevron's offer price, then we'll not take from Chevron,"" said the official, who   declined to be identified. Asked about sales of the test cargoes, a spokeswoman for Chevron said the company did not discuss activities related to LNG trading.Chevron will already have to sell some LNG on the spot market after securing 25-year sales deals for under 70 percent of its share of Gorgon LNG, according to company data, less than the 85 percent a project backer would normally seek to guarantee returns.The U.S. firm, which has a 47.3 percent stake in Gorgon,  has also signed a five-year deal with South Korea's SK LNG Trading to supply 0.83 mtpa starting from 2017.Australia is still on track to overtake Qatar as the world's top LNG supplier by the end of the decade, but expansions and some new plants at earlier stages are in doubt.Royal Dutch Shell Group's Arrow Energy shelved plans this year for a LNG plant at Queensland's Curtis Island.Ernst and Young has said around $200 billion of deepwater oil and gas facilities globally have been cancelled or put on hold in recent months due to the glut in energy supply. OPT OUT CLAUSE Japanese buyers will take nearly a third of Gorgon's output once commercial sales start, but if test shipments are not taken up then up to 2.4 million tonnes of LNG could hit spot markets leading up to April, Reuters calculations based on company data showed.This is equivalent to about 36 standard-size cargoes and could add to pressure on spot prices that have lost 60 percent in 18 months, although early LNG volumes can be highly variable due to startup issues.While firms with long-term contracts would normally be obliged to take gas during the test phase, an industry source briefed by a buyer said Japanese clients had built in the right to pass when negotiating their contracts.Aside from Tokyo Gas, other Japanese buyers of Gorgon include Chubu Electric Power and Osaka Gas, which also have small equity stakes in the project, and Kyushu Electric Power and JX Nippon Oil. Whether or not they take commissioning cargoes will largely depend on how competitively priced they are versus spot.Chevron tied long-term contract sales of Gorgon supply to oil prices at an estimated 14.85 percent, or ""slope"", of a barrel of Brent crude, with a small $0.50-$1.00 premium.That translates into an LNG price of $10.10 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) at current Brent prices, compared with spot LNG currently at $7.20 per mmBtu.Should oil rise towards year-end, as some analysts expect, the gap between Gorgon LNG supplies and spot prices could be stretched further.An Osaka Gas spokesman said no arrangements had been made for taking the first of the commissioning cargoes, though it was possible it could take some before the end of March.Chubu Electric and Kyushu Electric said the timing of the first delivery of gas was undecided, while JX Nippon declined to comment.Chevron could offer purchasers compensation to encourage them to take test shipments, a source familiar with the industry said.Japanese utilities could also wait to pick off odd commissioning cargoes if Chevron sells them on spot markets, as they did when ExxonMobil Corp brought its Papua New Guinea export plant on stream last year.Chevron, meanwhile, is said to have started sounding out potential buyers of test shipments.""They are dipping their toes in the market,"" said an Asian-based industry source, who said his company had been approached.The other major partners in Gorgon are ExxonMobil and  Shell, which each have 25 percent of the project.

461,"  (Adds comment from officials, Exxon spokesman and industry source)By Erwin SebaHOUSTON, July 20 A section of a key Gulf Coast waterway was shut after two barges collided Monday, setting one afire and possibly spilling a gasoline additive near the entrance to the Houston Ship Channel, the U.S. Coast Guard said.The Intracoastal Waterway (ICW), which runs between barrier islands and the coast of the U.S. mainland in the Gulf of Mexico, was shut from where it intersects the Houston Ship Channel to Mile Market 350 on the ICW.The Houston Ship Channel itself, which supplies the nation's busiest petrochemical port, remained open after the collision shortly after 1 a.m. local time (0600 GMT). Early media reports erroneously said a channel section had been closed, but it was unaffected.The Coast Guard said it took over four hours to extinguish the blaze on one of the barges, which was carrying 1 million gallons of the highly volatile gasoline additive naphtha. The Coast Guard and the Texas General Land Office said it was unclear if any of the naphtha spilled into the waterway.""At this time the impact on the environment is minimal,"" Trang Vu, senior response officer with Texas General Land Office, an agency which manages many state-owned areas. A Coast Guard spokesman said naphtha evaporates quickly and that 20,000 gallons spilled in the Ship Channel earlier this year evaporated in three hours.The collision occurred when one tug pulling the barges lost power, the Coast Guard said. It reported no injuries.For Gulf Coast U.S. refiners, the ICW is primarily used to ship refined products like gasoline, diesel, gas oil and naphtha to other plants. A source familiar with Gulf Coast refinery production said there was likely to be little impact to production from the ICW section shutdown.At Exxon Mobil Corp 's 560,500 barrel per day (bpd) Baytown, Texas refinery operations were normal and unaffected by the ICW barge collision, company spokesman Todd Spitler said. That refinery is the second largest in the United States.A dispatcher for the Houston ship pilots association said vessels moving on the Ship Channel near the ICW entrance were moving at a slower speed on Monday morning.""The ICW on the Bolivar (Peninsula) side is closed, no effect on the Ship Channel,"" the dispatcher said. ""They have to slow when they go through the area, but other than that there's no problems.""

464,"   By Clyde Russell | LAUNCESTON, Australia  LAUNCESTON, Australia With commodity prices slumping, the local currency slipping and manufacturing jobs disappearing, Australians are starting to question whether they've backed the wrong economic horse.The country's wealth and unbroken 24 years of economic growth have largely been built on exploiting natural resources and the happy coincidence of being close to China just as its demand for iron ore, coal and other minerals exploded.But with China's growth slowing and many commodities in structural oversupply after resource companies over-estimated future demand, Australia finds itself facing some uncomfortable issues.Liquefied natural gas (LNG) neatly encapsulates the problems facing Australia.A combination of international and local companies have invested about $200 billion in the past few years to massively expand Australia's LNG capacity, building eight new projects.This will more than quadruple Australia's output of the super-chilled fuel to over 80 million tonnes per annum, in the process overtaking Qatar as the world's largest producer and leaving regional rivals Malaysia and Indonesia far behind.But much like iron ore and coal, it now appears that the demand forecasts for LNG that underpinned the projects were optimistic, and producers are likely to find it increasingly difficult to source buyers, especially for the part of output that isn't tied to long-term contracts.Even the cargoes delivered into long-term contracts won't deliver the revenue that companies probably expected they would, given they are oil-linked and crude, in common with other commodities, has slumped and the outlook remains soft.Asian spot LNG prices climbed to $8.10 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) in the week ended July 24, but this is down almost 20 percent from the start of the year and 60 percent from the record high of $20.50 reached in February last year.While major LNG investors such as Chevron, Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch Shell and Australia's Santos wouldn't have expected prices of around $20 per mmBtu to sustain, they could reasonably have forecast around $12-$14 as a long-term price when they were making investment decisions in the past five years.NOT ALL BAD NEWS While the slump in LNG prices has no doubt weakened the economics of the projects and increased the length of time it will take to make positive returns, there are still positives. Despite weak demand growth this year, longer-term forecasts are still bullish for LNG, even if they have been tempered from the wild exuberance of previous years.ANZ Bank expects LNG usage in Asia will grow by 40 percent in the next decade on rising demand for cleaner energy.This would allow Australia's LNG exports to triple to an annual value of more than A$50 billion ($36 billion), making the fuel the country's biggest export earner, overtaking current number one iron ore and second-ranked coal, the bank said in a report released July 23.But rising LNG exports are also a double-edged sword for Australia as while they deliver export earnings and royalty taxes for the government, they will also cause the price of domestic natural gas to rise to levels linked to international prices.This means domestic wholesale natural gas prices may almost double, which could lower aggregate profitability of gas-dependant manufacturers, such as chemical and metals, by 20 percent, according to ANZ.While the bank says this means manufacturers must adopt strategies to mitigate higher gas prices, in reality this is likely to lead to further hollowing out of the industrial base.The decade-long, China-inspired commodity price boom from 2004 onwards resulted in the Australian dollar surging to a record high of around $1.10. In turn this put enormous pressure on import-competing industries, with the most obvious casualty being vehicle manufacturing, with the local units of General Motors, Ford and Toyota all announcing an end to manufacturing by 2018.While lower commodity prices caused the Australian dollar to slip to $0.7290 in early trade Monday, the risk is that the LNG export boom once again renders industries uncompetitive, and once factories close they tend to close forever.There are also no major LNG projects likely to be built after the current wave, given the poor outlook for prices and increased supply from the United States and potentially Canada, meaning the workers currently building plants will struggle to find new jobs.PROJECT PIPELINE EMPTIES This is also the case in iron ore, where the mining giants BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto have largely completed their expansion plans and are now seeking to cut workers in a bid to lower costs in response to low prices. In coal, the same dynamic is at work, with serious question marks now being raised over whether the new projects in the Galilee Basin in Queensland state will actually proceed.India's Adani has stopped development work on its planned A$10 billion Carmichael coal mine in the Galilee, increasing speculation it's preparing to walk away from the 40-million tonne a year project.Australia also appears increasingly out of step with its global peers on climate change, with conservative Prime Minister Tony Abbott lauding coal while decrying wind farms as ""visually awful"", and ordering a government clean energy financing agency to stop funding wind and solar power.However, the headline-grabbing issues don't quite encapsulate some basic realities.Australia is the world's largest exporter of iron ore, and will most likely reclaim its top spot in coal from Indonesia in the coming years.It will become number one in LNG within three years and while green activists may not like these commodities, demand for them is likely to remain robust for decades to come.In the meantime, Australia is also likely to benefit from increased demand for agricultural products, as well as from export-orientated industries such as tourism and higher education.It's worth remembering two things from Australia's recent history.In 1980, former Singapore prime minister and elder statesman Lee Kuan Yew said Australians risked becoming the ""poor white trash of Asia."" His warning that reform was needed to open up and innovate the economy was heeded and instead of falling behind the Asian tigers, Australia managed to increase living standards.At the height of the technology revolution hailed by former U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan as a new economic paradigm, Australia was ignored by investors as an old economy, dominated by mining.The tech wreck of 2001 and the rise of China brought the old economy back into vogue, but the challenge for Australia is once again to navigate the turbulent waters of the commodity cycle.

465,"  (Adds quotes, details, output levels)By Erwin SebaHOUSTON, July 30 Exxon Mobil Corp has pulled together a group of experts at its sprawling Beaumont, Texas, refinery to do more detailed studies to add a third crude distillation unit that could make it the top fuel-making plant in the United States, sources familiar with the matter said on Thursday. The formation of the group indicates Exxon is moving closer toward expanding the 334,600-barrel-per-day plant. Reuters previously reported the company was eyeing a plan to lift capacity at Beaumont to as much as 850,000 bpd.Exxon declined to comment on the formation of the group, called ""Crude C"" for the proposed third crude distillation unit. The expansion would cost several billion dollars and take several years. ""The Crude C group is studying how to build the new crude unit and where to put it,"" one of the sources said. ""They have offices in the refinery and are running around in their own trucks."" Late last month, the United Steelworkers union representing workers at the refinery agreed to a six-year contract with Exxon. That is two years longer than a national contract agreed to by U.S. refinery owners in March.Sources familiar with Exxon's plans have said the company lobbied hard for the longer pact to assure no work stoppages while construction to expand the refinery is under way.

Nine companies in total submitted proposals for the blocks on offer including Canoverseas, Troisade, Total, Namoza, Delinex, Petrolinvest, Exxon, Eni and Sasol. The blocks on offer include three new areas of the northern Rovuma Basin, where Eni and U.S. oil major Anadarko Petroleum Corp are already developing multi-billion-dollar liquefied natural gas (LNG) export projects. Mozambican officials expect more than $30 billion will be invested initially in the natural gas sector to build capacity to produce 20 million tonnes per year of liquefied natural gas (LNG), with first exports due to start in 2018.The southern African nation is hoping revenue from its large natural gas deposits and its fledgling coal mining industry will help it emerge from years of poverty and aid dependence.

468,"   By Ernest Scheyder and Anna Driver  Weak oil prices shriveled quarterly profit at Exxon Mobil Corp and Chevron Corp on Friday, compelling both companies to rethink operations and plan for what many expect to be a sustained period of cheap crude.Earnings at U.S. oil majors Exxon, which were the worst in a decade, and Chevron missed analysts' expectations, adding to concerns that perhaps executives had not acted quickly enough to mitigate the impact of an over-50-percent drop in oil prices since last summer.The results highlight how smaller and more nimble U.S. shale oil companies have slashed costs faster and more aggressively than global majors. Some shale producers have cut back drilling by 60 percent or more.Evan Calio, an analyst with Morgan Stanley, said on Exxon's earnings conference call that the oil giant appeared to be less vocal than its peers about cutting costs.Jeff Woodbury, Exxon's head of investor relations, responded that the company was constantly focused on capital efficiency and cost management.    Still, Exxon is sticking for now with its plans to spend $34 billion this year, although that figure has a downward bias because of cost savings and efficiencies, Woodbury said.Chevron also still plans to spend $35 billion this year, but said it would spend less in 2016 and 2017 as several mega projects come online.CUTS AT EUROPEAN RIVALS  Exxon and Chevron's European peers such as Royal Dutch Shell Plc have taken more aggressive action. BP Plc cut its budget for the second time this year, while Shell said it would lay off 6,500 workers.   Exxon's profit fell by more than half, with the biggest drop in its exploration and production business, where earnings slumped by nearly $6 billionChevron's profit plunged 90 percent, a starker drop and one exacerbated by a $2.22 billion loss in its exploration and production division.Pat Yarrington, Chevron's chief financial officer, seeking to head off complaints about cost management, said the company had slashed about $3 billion in spending so far this year, and wasn't done. Still, analysts peppered her throughout the earnings call for details.  Though production grew at both companies, they missed the estimates of many analysts who had expected the energy giants to pump more.Shares of both slumped more than 3 percent in afternoon trading.  BRIGHT SPOT To be sure, the two companies benefited from their refining divisions, which make gasoline and other fuels. Refining units tend to be far more profitable when oil prices are low, providing Chevron and other integrated energy companies with an internal hedge during times when core operations, such as oil production, are weighed down by weak prices.Both companies stressed their ability to weather the price doldrums and emerge stronger. Chevron's Chief Executive John Watson, for instance, bluntly described the results as ""weak."" He laid off 2 percent of its staff earlier this week.""I think in general the industry is putting a sharper pencil to cost cutting,"" said Brian Youngberg, senior oil company analyst at Edward Jones in St Louis. ""I think they are realizing the days of $100 a barrel (oil) are over.""      Exxon also said Friday it would slow its share repurchase program. The company purchased $1 billion of its own stock in the second quarter, but expects to spend roughly half of that on repurchases in the third quarter.Chevron earlier this year scrapped its entire repurchase program.

479,"   By Kristen Hays | HOUSTON  HOUSTON Aug 4 Exxon Mobil Corp has reversed part of an oil pipeline from northeastern Texas to northern Louisiana in the first step of a bigger plan to link Permian Basin output to Louisiana refineries.Exxon last month reversed a 71-mile (114 km) segment of its North Line pipeline from Longview, Texas, to Shreveport and Finney in northern Louisiana, the company said on Tuesday.That segment is helping feed about 15,000 barrels per day of Texas crude to Delek U.S. Holdings' Arkansas refinery, displacing barrels that had been trucked or railed to the plant at higher transportation costs, Delek's executive vice president, Mark Smith, told analysts on Tuesday during Delek's quarterly earnings call.Smith said Delek's 80,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) El Dorado refinery is North Line's sole shipper until Exxon finishes reversing another idle stretch ""all the way down to Baton Rouge"" where Exxon operates a 502,500 bpd refinery. Delek moves barrels from Shreveport to the refinery via its Magnolia pipeline system.The North Line pipeline is a 160,000 bpd system that had moved mostly Heavy Louisiana Sweet crude from the St. James, Louisiana crude hub northwest to Finney, then west to Longview. In April 2012, 1,900 barrels of crude spilled from a 17-foot rupture in the line about 27 miles (43 km) west of Baton Rouge. Exxon shut the line, then restarted the portion that runs from St. James to the Baton Rouge refinery's tank farm in Anchorage, Louisiana the next month.The rest remained shut, leaving Delek's Arkansas plant to increase trucking and start taking crude via rail to make up for lost North Line barrels. But late last year Exxon teamed up with Sunoco Logistics Partners and SunVit Pipeline LLC, a joint venture of Sunoco and energy trader Vitol, to assemble a system to move Permian barrels to Louisiana via Longview.The 100,000 bpd Permian Longview and Louisiana Extension, or PELA, project involves three parts. SunVit will build a pipeline to Garden City, Texas, from the Midland hub in West Texas, and Sunoco will construct the leg from Garden City to Longview.Exxon's part involves reversing North Line to move crude from Longview to Anchorage, though a spokesman declined to comment beyond the Longview-to-Shreveport segment. The companies have not disclosed the cost, but the entire project is slated to start up by mid-2016.

480,"  (Adds details, background)By Felix OnuahABUJA Aug 4 Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari appointed a new head of the state oil firm on Tuesday, part of an overhaul aimed at rooting out corruption and mismanagement.Emmanuel Ibe Kachikwu was named as the new managing director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), which has been accused of failing to account for tens of billions of dollars in the last few years.Buhari, who was elected in March, has made clear his desire to clean up the oil sector, which provides the government with about 70 percent of its revenue. He dissolved the NNPC board in June as a first step. ""Dr. Kachikwu who was the executive vice chairman and general counsel of Exxon-Mobil (Africa) is to take over from Dr. Joseph Thlama Dawha,"" said a statement issued by the president's spokesman Femi Adesina.Kachikwu has a law degree from the University of Nigeria and also studied at Harvard Law School before embarking on a career that took him to Texaco Nigeria Limited and later Exxon-Mobil.Buhari, who was inaugurated on May 29, is yet to announce his cabinet and is seen as likely to keep the oil portfolio for himself rather than trust others with an industry that has long been mired in corruption scandals. The NNPC represents national interests in oil and gas exploration, manages the energy sector and is also the oil sector regulator.Constitutionally, it is meant to remit all revenues to the country's treasury but the act establishing the state firm allows it to retain what it needs to cover costs with little oversight. The result is a legal grey area that has been open for abuse for decades.In June, the National Economic Council said the NNPC had earned 8.1 trillion naira ($41 billion) from 2012 until May 2015, but only paid 4.3 trillion to the federal government.And a 2013 investigation by the then central bank governor Lamido Sanusi found the state oil company had failed to pay $20 billion in revenues to government accounts between January 2012 and July 2013.The NNPC said the money could be accounted for and was therefore not lost. A subsequent audit by PwC found that some funds were unaccounted for, but bemoaned a lack of cooperation and issued an audit with extensive caveats.

The acreage will be operated by Exxon's shale drilling unit, XTO Energy Inc. Exxon has long held that it will only make acquisitions that complement existing holdings where the Irving, Texas oil giant believes it can drive out costs.On the company's second quarter earnings call last week, Exxon executive Jeff Woodbury said the company has been able to enjoy a ""value uplift"" in previous acquisitions in the Permian around its existing operations.The Permian Basin is one area where Exxon has focused its so-called unconventional exploration where horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing are used to pry oil and gas from rocks.

483,"   By Kristen Hays | HOUSTON  HOUSTON Aug 13 Exxon Mobil Corp hopes to restart its crippled Los Angeles-area refinery at reduced rates in September, partially restoring a key gasoline supply source in a region that has wrestled with repeated price spikes during the plant's six-month shutdown.Southern California pollution regulators revealed Exxon's proposed restart plan on Thursday, shortly before the state's Division of Occupational Safety and Health, or Cal/OSHA, said it issued 19 citations with $566,600 in penalties to the oil giant for safety violations stemming from a Feb. 18 explosion that forced the closure.Exxon cannot restart the 149,500 barrels per day Torrance refinery until Cal/OSHA deems the gasoline-making fluid catalytic cracking unit (FCCU) safe to operate.The company had hoped to restart the plant this summer, but last month sources told Reuters it was expected to remain shut through the end of 2015. The blast destroyed crucial equipment associated with FCCU and left the Los Angeles market tight on supply and vulnerable to price spikes.Pump prices last month surpassed $4 a gallon as demand grew, imports dipped and other regional refineries had outages. Those factors, on top of California's boutique blending requirements and other regulations, mean the state's gasoline is among the most expensive in the country when supply is adequate. More outages are on the horizon as the fall maintenance season looms.""There are lots of refinery issues, so what we see in this very expensive market is not going away. It's not going away until Torrance comes back,"" Gordon Schremp, senior fuels specialist at the California Energy Commission, said Tuesday in an interview. ""We are going to have very expensive gasoline at least through Thanksgiving."" Exxon wants to use some older equipment and adjust other parts to ensure overall emissions stay the same so Torrance can restart next month. The plant would run at 65 percent of normal rates until final fixes are done.Specifically, Exxon wants to use old electrostatic precipitators (ESP), or devices that cut FCC emissions, because the blast destroyed newer ones. Five cooling towers would be retrofitted, and the plant would shut a boiler.The South Coast Air Quality Management District, which regulates air pollution in southern California, will ask its hearing board to consider Exxon's proposal on Sept. 2.Mohsen Nazemi, the agency's deputy executive officer, said in an interview that Exxon's plan includes time for safety tests or other measures to satisfy Cal/OSHA restart requirements.

486,"   By Jonathan Stempel  Exxon Mobil Corp's $225 million settlement with the administration of New Jersey Governor Chris Christie of a longstanding environmental pollution case won approval on Tuesday from a state judge, over the objections of critics who called the accord a sellout.Judge Michael Hogan of the State Superior Court called the accord a ""reasonable compromise given the substantial litigation risks"" for the state at trial and on appeal, although the payout was not even 3 percent of the $8.9 billion in damages sought.New Jersey wanted to hold Exxon responsible for decades of natural resources contamination stemming from its refinery operations in Bayonne and Linden, as well as other facilities, including more than 1,700 gas stations.It said this included damage that turned more than 1,500 acres of wetlands and marshes into toxic wastelands.The state has called Exxon's payout the second-largest for natural resources damages from a single company in U.S. history. But environmental critics and Democratic legislators have faulted Christie, a Republican running for U.S. president, for entering a lowball settlement rather than continuing to fight in court, where Hogan oversaw a trial that ran 66 days last year.Margaret Brown, a lawyer for the Natural Resources Defense Council, called the accord a ""slap on the wrist"" for Exxon, which made $32.5 billion of profit in 2014, that will do little to undo the damage. ""Exxon could have been on the hook for very significant damages, but won a sweeping release,"" she said in an interview. ""It's a huge loss for the people of New Jersey and the environment.""In his 81-page decision, Hogan called the settlement fair, reasonable and in the public interest, saying it ensured the prompt cleanup of hazardous substances without the need to spend more taxpayer money on litigation.The judge also noted the surrounding controversy.

487,"  (Adds details from decision, comments from state and environmental group)By Jonathan StempelAug 25 Exxon Mobil Corp's $225 million settlement with the administration of New Jersey Governor Chris Christie of a longstanding environmental pollution case won approval on Tuesday from a state judge, over the objections of critics who called the accord a sellout.Judge Michael Hogan of the State Superior Court called the accord a ""reasonable compromise given the substantial litigation risks"" for the state at trial and on appeal, although the payout was not even 3 percent of the $8.9 billion in damages sought.New Jersey wanted to hold Exxon responsible for decades of natural resources contamination stemming from its refinery operations in Bayonne and Linden, as well as other facilities, including more than 1,700 gas stations.It said this included damage that turned more than 1,500 acres of wetlands and marshes into toxic wastelands. The state has called Exxon's payout the second-largest for natural resources damages from a single company in U.S. history.But environmental critics and Democratic legislators have faulted Christie, a Republican running for U.S. president, for entering a lowball settlement rather than continuing to fight in court, where Hogan oversaw a trial that ran 66 days last year.Margaret Brown, a lawyer for the Natural Resources Defense Council, called the accord a ""slap on the wrist"" for Exxon, which made $32.5 billion of profit in 2014, that will do little to undo the damage. ""Exxon could have been on the hook for very significant damages, but won a sweeping release,"" she said in an interview. ""It's a huge loss for the people of New Jersey and the environment.""In his 81-page decision, Hogan called the settlement fair, reasonable and in the public interest, saying it ensured the prompt cleanup of hazardous substances without the need to spend more taxpayer money on litigation. The judge also noted the surrounding controversy.""Nearly any consent decree can be viewed simultaneously as a crackdown or a sellout,"" he wrote.

492,"  (Adds details on financing, advisers)HOUSTON, Sept 17 Bankruptcy proceedings over the future of the Hovensa refinery were slated to open in federal court in the U.S. Virgin Islands on Thursday, two days after it filed for protection, saying it owes $1.86 billion to owners Hess Corp and Venezuela's PDVSA.Since the 500,000-barrel-per-day refinery was shuttered in 2012 on mounting losses, Hovensa has been struggling to pay its debts and obligations. Those include a $40 million environmental fine filed by the Islands' government and notes issued in 2012 to pay back its owners.Hovensa's owners have told the bankruptcy court that they agreed to sell the company's terminal and storage facilities to ArcLight Capital Partners LLC affiliate Limetree Bay Holdings LLC for $184 million.Under that agreement, subject to court approval, Limetree would take on some of Hovensa's debts, which are 10 times greater than the price tag. Hovensa said investment bank Lazard Ltd was advising it. A previous attempt to sell the whole plant and restart the refinery failed last year after the Islands' Senate rejected the plan and expressed doubts about that buyer, Atlantic Basin Refining.In February, the owners decided to idle the refinery's 32-million-barrel storage terminal, which Hovensa had rented out. In its court filings, Hovensa said it owed its owners more than $1.86 billion, including interest.The company also said it had a loss of $1.3 billion between 2009 and 2011. Its island location and outdated power infrastructure left it hamstrung with high costs. During that same period, cash-strapped PDVSA sold several overseas assets, including refineries and terminals in Europe and the United States. Its latest sale was in June, when U.S. company PBF Energy Inc struck a deal to buy the Chalmette refinery in Louisiana, which is jointly owned with Exxon Mobil Corp.Hovensa's restructuring officer underlined the importance of this new sale attempt in the middle of debts and lawsuits.""If consummated, the sale transaction will generate proceeds sufficient to pay in full in cash the $40 million secured claim asserted by the Government,"" the court filing says.Hovensa was formed in 1998 between Hess and PDVSA to process Venezuelan heavy crudes. Each party has 50 percent ownership. It once employed 2,500 people, representing 25 percent of the Saint Croix workforce.

493,"  CARACAS, Sept 18 A World Bank arbitration tribunal has reinstated a suspension of an order for Venezuela to pay $1.6 billion to Exxon Mobil Corp in compensation for nationalization of oil facilities, pending a decision on the country's request to annul the award.The International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) said on its web site that ""following several communications from the parties, the ad hoc Committee issues a decision on the stay of enforcement of the award,"" without giving further details.In a statement on Friday announcing the stay of enforcement, the Venezuelan attorney-general's office added a decision on the annulment request was expected in 2016, and ""the republic expects the award to be annulled.""The suspension measure appears to hand the socialist-ruled OPEC nation a breather on the award. Exxon representatives could not immediately be reached for comment. The suspension had been lifted in June after the tribunal rejected Venezuela's request to review the order to pay Exxon. Venezuela argued that a previous decision by the Paris-based International Chamber of Commerce should be deducted from the ICSID award.Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA paid Exxon $200 million in 2012, which ""should have ended the dispute in relation to this project, without need for any additional payment by the nation,"" the attorney general office's statement said. President Nicolas Maduro's government is facing a raft of big-figure arbitration claims as it grapples with an economic crisis, a tumble in oil prices and substantial debt payments.Arbitration experts say Venezuela was seeking to delay collection of awards by lodging requests for reviews or annulments.

494,"  (Adds quotes, detail about refinery shutdown)By Kristen HaysHOUSTON, Sept 23 The restart of Exxon Mobil Corp's hobbled California refinery has been pushed to February 2016, West Coast refined product market sources said on Tuesday.The company in August proposed restarting the plant at reduced rates as soon as this month using older equipment as an interim measure, but crews have been pulled from that effort to focus on the final fix with new equipment, the sources said.The 149,500 barrels-per-day (bpd) refinery in Torrance has been shut since a Feb. 18 explosion destroyed equipment critical to controlling emissions from a gasoline-making fluid catalytic cracking unit (FCCU). The Torrance plant provides 10 percent of California's gasoline supply and its shutdown has, at times, exacerbated the state's vulnerability to price spikes.Bob van der Valk, an independent fuel pricing expert briefed on Exxon's decision by plant workers, said crews that had been working on a pipeline intended to connect older emissions-controlling equipment to the FCCU until Monday, when the company decided to forego the interim restart. Another source familiar with the matter said Exxon's interim plan lacked full support of air pollution regulators at the South Coast Air Quality Management District and California's Division of Occupational Safety and Health, or Cal/OSHA, particularly as Cal/OSHA investigates a Sept. 6 leak of highly toxic hydrofluoric acid at the plant.Neither Exxon nor the regulators would comment on whether the leak was a factor in delaying consideration of the restart plan. Hearings before a South Coast hearing board this month were twice postponed and then canceled without being rescheduled.

498,"  * Gassled partners have six weeks to decide on appeal* Government satisfied with decision -oil ministry   (Adds detail from ruling, reaction, firms' bond ratings)By Stine Jacobsen and Gwladys FoucheOSLO, Sept 25 An Oslo court ruled on Friday in favour of Norway in a lawsuit involving a group of international investors who argued that Norway's decision to cut natural gas pipeline tariffs would cost them 15 billion crowns ($1.8 billion) in lost earnings by 2028.Challenging Norway's reputation as a predictable place to do business, four firms owned by funds including Allianz, UBS, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, argued that Norway illegally cut fees on the 8,000-km (5,000-mile) Gassled gas pipeline network.The four firms, which hold a combined 45 percent stake in Gassled, said they would consider whether to appeal the decision.""All four plaintiffs will now evaluate this in detail and assess the next step within the next six weeks, which is the deadline,"" Kurt Georgsen, CEO of Gassled partner Silex Gas, told Reuters. The stakes were bought in 2010 and 2011 from ExxonMobil , Total, Statoil and Royal Dutch Shell .The Oil and Energy Ministry had not provided full information to the buyers and sellers regarding how the tariffs could be changed, the court said, but added that the ministry's officials themselves at the time had been unaware of how easily this could be done.""The ministry is to blame for this, but following an overall assessment the court concludes that the actions of the ministry's leadership can't be regarded as qualifying negligence - which according to the law is a condition for triggering liability,"" said the ruling. The losing party in a lawsuit in Norway will most often be told to pay the winner's legal fees, but in the case of the Gassled lawsuit, the government was partly to blame for the fact that it had gone to trial, the court said.""Therefore, the parties shall pay their own legal costs,"" it added.The oil and energy ministry said in a statement that it was ""satisfied"" with the verdict. The firms, many of which bought into Gassled in 2011 through a 17 billion crown deal for state-controlled Statoil's  24 percent stake, argued the tariff cut benefits gas producers, the very firms that sold them their stakes.The state refuted the claim, arguing that returns were above agreed levels and fees were so high that they discouraged new offshore investment.It said most profit from oil and gas should be derived from the fields, not from the infrastructure, and that pipeline tariffs needed to be cut from October 2016 because the predicted returns had been achieved.One of the investors, Njord Gas Infrastructure, owned by UBS and France's Caisse des Depots, had its bond rating lowered in 2013 to junk status from investment grade as a result of the change in tariff. It is currently rated BB by Standard & Poor's.Solveig Gas Norway, owned by the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, Allianz and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, also saw a multi-level downgrade of its bonds in 2013, and currently has a Baa2 rating by Moody's.

499,"  * Eni Zohr gas find biggest ever in Mediterranean* Zohr success due to different geology approach - CEO* Eni took gamble on Zohr - rival insider* Eni has discovered over 10 bln barrels in 7 years* link.reuters.com/tag65w* link.reuters.com/caz65wBy Stephen JewkesMILAN, Sept 25 Eni's giant Zohr gas find in Egypt this month, a gamble taken under the noses of competitors, marked the Italian major's rapid rise to preeminence in the hunt for big new fields.Its risk-taking new leadership went ahead with what rivals described as an opportunistic drilling plan, leaving peers BP , BG, Royal Dutch Shell and Total  regretting they missed a golden opportunity.Zohr is Eni's fifth major oil and gas discovery in just 3 years giving it the best track record in reserve replacement as well as one of the lowest cost bases. The 30 trillion cubic feet gas field, the biggest ever discovery in the Mediterranean, pleased investors, vindicating CEO Claudio Descalzi's new strategy of revisiting mature basins where infrastructure and know-how are already in place and where new in-house technologies and geological skills can be used to discover more.But it left some majors with a bitter taste. The field used to be part of a huge block where Shell sunk wells, all of which turned out dry or non-commercial. The area was later repackaged and offered to others, including Eni and BP.Earlier this year Eni opened a data room to find a partner to help develop Zohr. None of those that participated made a bid before the room closed in July -- just one month before Eni made its drilling breakthrough.""BP, BG, Total and Edison all went into the data room but made no offer because they simply didn't believe in it,"" two sources close to the matter said.The companies declined to comment but an insider at a rival major said it had not been straightforward. Eni had been opportunistic and taken a gamble by choosing to use 2D rather than more sophisticated 3D seismic data testing. ""No one took the risk to join. Obviously everyone is regretting it now but it was turned down because it wasn't slam dunk,"" the source said.Descalzi, a trained reservoir engineer who took over as CEO in May last year, put Eni's success in Egypt down to the different sequencing models it used based on experience gleaned by its discovery team elsewhere.""We were looking for different geological sequences, not the classical sand reservoir but a carbonate reservoir, the same model as in our finds in Venezuela and Kazakhstan,"" he said.A pitch to the broader industry had been made earlier. Last year, Eni's exploration chief Luca Bertelli publicly presented a paper at the oil and gas conference in Alexandria laying out in detail the geology of the area and its potential.DIVIDENDS CONCERN  In the last 7 years Eni has discovered more than 10 billion barrels of oil equivalent, equal to 2.5 times its production, with a 2014 organic reserves replacement ratio of 112 percent, well above peers.The new finds have cheered investors with the prospect of cash flow from higher production and the sale of prize acreage -- not just the wholly owned Zohr, valued by Italian investment house Mediobanca at up to 5 billion euros, but in Mozambique and Congo too.But though Eni was the first major to cut its dividend last year to ease a stretched balance sheet, doubts still remain on the thorny question of returns.""The key concern is dividends for the next 2-3 years which will need divestments to be covered. If they don't deliver something in the next 3-6 months then there could be another cut on the horizon,"" said Jason Kenney, oil analyst at Santander.The 60-year-old Descalzi, head of E&P before nomination to the top spot last year by the government of Matteo Renzi, is looking to turn Eni into a leaner exploration-focused animal and has put the emphasis on simple conventional projects in emerging basins or legacy assets.This comes after an operational disaster under the previous management at the very complex giant Kashagan project in Kazakhstan. The $50 billion development has seen a decade of delays and cost overruns and Eni was ultimately stripped of the operatorship by its fellow partners Shell and Exxon.""Zohr is top quality clean gas that can be gotten to market fast. It costs one third that of the Arctic and a fifth that of fracking,"" says Davide Tabarelli, head of energy think tank Nomisma Energie.Crucially, Descalzi has made sure discovery budgets remain flush and made sure there are more Eni engineers on site to get a better grip on projects.Eni has traditionally held the discovery side of its business in high esteem. So much so that many of the streets around the group's Milan headquarters in San Donato are named after famous geologists.

The spill was at the time the largest ever in U.S. waters, and one of the worst human-caused environmental disasters.  Over the following months, the oil slick spread over 1,300 miles (2,092 km) of Alaska's rocky, pristine coast, killing or injuring more than two dozen types of animals, plants, and marine habitats in Alaska's Prince William Sound, environmental officials said.In a sweeping 1991 settlement, the oil giant was ordered to pay $900 million in civil damages and $125 million in criminal fines and restitution. In 2006, state and federal officials requested Exxon pay an additional $92 million under a special ""reopener"" provision to fund cleanup stemming from long-term damages. The company has refused to pay this amount, maintaining that despite lingering oil in Prince William Sound, the environment has recovered and cleanup was successful.

518,"  * Riyadh discounting aggressively to win European custom* Saudi crude even going to former Soviet bloc states* Moscow has muscled in on Asian markets for years* Battle makes Russian-OPEC output cuts yet more elusiveBy Dmitry Zhdannikov, Gleb Gorodyankin and Reem ShamseddineLONDON/MOSCOW, Oct 15 From global majors such as Shell and Total to more modest Polish energy firms, oil refiners in Europe are cutting their longstanding use of Russian crude in favour of Saudi grades as the world's top exporters fight for market share.Russia has for years been muscling in on Asian markets where Saudi Arabia was once the unchallenged dominant supplier. But now Riyadh is retaliating in Moscow's backyard of Europe with aggressive price discounting.This has nothing to do with Western sanctions imposed on Russia over Ukraine, which apply to energy industry equipment but not to oil or gas itself. Instead it is a commercial battle for customers as both exporters ramp up their output despite weak world oil prices.This is likely to complicate further a dialogue between Moscow and the OPEC exporters' group on tackling the global oil glut, with joint production cuts already looking elusive.Trading sources told Reuters that majors such as Exxon, Shell, Total and Eni have been all buying more Saudi oil for their refineries in Western Europe and the Mediterranean in the past few months at the expense of Russian oil. ""I'm buying less and less Russian crude for my refineries in Europe simply because Saudi barrels are looking more attractive. It is a no brainer for me as Saudi crude is just cheaper,"" said a trading source with one major, who asked not to be named because he is not allowed to speak to the media.Riyadh traditionally focused on the U.S. and Asian markets, leaving Moscow as a major supplier to Europe, especially the eastern countries that were once part of the Soviet bloc.But Russia's most powerful oil executive, Rosneft  chief Igor Sechin, said on Tuesday that Saudi Arabia had started supplying ex-communist Poland at ""dumping"" prices.  Then on Wednesday, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak described the Saudi entry into eastern European markets was the ""toughest competition"".Trading sources said at least one cargo reached the Polish port of Gdansk in September and two more could come in October, to be processed by refiners PKN Orlen and Lotos.Two trading sources said Saudi Arabia was looking at storing crude in Gdansk so that it can supply eastern European customers more quickly, just as it has done for years for western European clients from ports in the Netherlands or Belgium. One trader said supplies from Gdansk could be sent to Germany to compete with Russian crude sent down the Soviet-built Druzhba (Friendship) pipeline.The Baltic state of Lithuania, once a Soviet republic, is also looking to diversify its energy supplies. Lithuanian energy minister Rokas Masiulis told Reuters on Wednesday that the country is in talks with U.S. liquefied natural gas company Cheniere Energy Inc over possible imports as it tries to cut its dependence on Russian supplier Gazprom.LOCKING MARKET SHARE  The battle may raise suspicions in Moscow that Riyadh is trying to punish the Kremlin for supporting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, an enemy of Saudi Arabia, most recently with Russian air strikes on rebel groups.In fact, Moscow and Riyadh were already locked in another  battle for market share in Asia long before Syria slid into civil war after 2011 or the West imposed the sanctions on Russia last year.Over the past decade, Russia has diverted as much as a third of its oil exports to Asia by building gigantic pipelines into mainland China and its Pacific coast.""There is a perception that because Russia has been pushed from the West, they have been turning to the East. In fact, Russia has been actively locking market share in Asia for a long time,"" said Seth Kleinman, the head of energy research at Citigroup.Kleinman said the competition has become so intense in Asian markets in recent months that Saudi Arabia had to reduce supplies there in the face of growing deliveries from rivals such as Russia, Kuwait and Angola.Meanwhile, the low oil prices have spurred demand in Europe after years of lacklustre performance.""For the first time in many years the European market looks more interesting than the Asian market. So Middle Eastern producers are looking to take that opportunity,"" a senior Iraqi oil source told Reuters.The competition is likely to intensify in the next few months as Iran, which supplied between five and 10 percent of Europe's crude before 2012, is set to return with large volumes if and when Western sanctions on Tehran are lifted.""The Saudis want to secure the market share before Iran comes back,"" said a trading source with an oil major.

519,"   By Victoria Cavaliere  Oct 14 U.S. and Alaska state officials announced on Wednesday they will no longer seek an additional $92 million from Exxon Mobil Corp. to pay for environmental cleanup and restoration stemming from the massive Exxon Valdez oil spill nearly three decades ago.In court documents filed on Wednesday, the state of Alaska and U.S. Justice Department said they were dropping remaining judicial action and would no longer seek the additional money from Exxon due to the recovery of several species, including ducks and sea otters, living in Alaska's Prince William Sound.""Although we will not be pursuing Exxon for additional damages, our decision today does not close the book on lingering oil,"" Alaska Attorney General Craig Richards said in a statement.The tanker Valdez ran aground in March, 1989, dumping about 11 million gallons, or 260,000 barrels, of crude oil into the icy waters off the southern coast of Alaska. The spill was at the time the largest ever in U.S. waters, and one of the worst human-caused environmental disasters. Over the following months, the oil slick spread over 1,300 miles (2,092 km) of Alaska's rocky, pristine coast, killing or injuring more than two dozen types of animals, plants, and marine habitats in Alaska's Prince William Sound, environmental officials said.In a sweeping 1991 settlement, the oil giant was ordered to pay $900 million in civil damages and $125 million in criminal fines and restitution.In 2006, state and federal officials requested Exxon pay an additional $92 million under a special ""reopener"" provision to fund cleanup stemming from long-term damages. The company has refused to pay this amount, maintaining that despite lingering oil in Prince William Sound, the environment has recovered and cleanup was successful.A call to Exxon seeking comment about the decision by state and federal officials to drop the pursuit of the additional payout was not immediately returned. Last year, a report issued by the U.S. Geological Survey said that sea otters in the most affected parts of Prince William Sound have recovered to their pre-spill numbers. Thousands were killed in the aftermath of the tanker running aground.The slow pace of recovery for the otters was likely due to their ongoing exposure to oil, the study found.The filing late Wednesday came ahead of a planned status hearing in the U.S. District Court in Anchorage on Thursday.(Reporting by Victoria Cavaliere in Los Angeles; Editing by Biju Dwarakanath)",2015-10-15,XOM,"Thu Oct 15, 2015 | 1:53am EDT","U.S., Alaska says will not seek additional $92 mln from Exxon for Valdez spill",http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-alaska-valdez-idUSL1N12F08920151015?type=companyNews
520,"   By Steve Gorman | LOS ANGELES  LOS ANGELES The unexplained release of a large vapor cloud on Friday from an Exxon Mobil Corp refinery near Los Angeles prompted authorities to sound public safety sirens, but no toxic fumes were detected and no one was hurt, a fire official said.The mishap was reported around sunset in Torrance, California, at a refinery that had been largely shut down since an explosion and fire at a processing unit on Feb. 18 injured four workers and destroyed emissions-controlling equipment.That blast led state regulators to cite the company for 19 occupational safety violations at the 149,500-barrel-per-day refinery, with $566,600 in penalties.A plan to restart the refinery last month was indefinitely postponed after a Sept. 6 leak of highly toxic hydroflouric acid.As a precaution on Friday, city officials sounded sirens warning area residents to remain indoors with windows and doors closed, and traffic barriers were lowered over a street that runs along the refinery's eastern edge, Torrance Fire Department Captain Bob Millea said.But all-clear chimes were sounded within a half-hour of the first alarm from the incident, Millea told Reuters. He said the vapor appeared to be a large steam cloud that rose 150 to 200 feet in the air and drifted eastward from the refinery before dissipating. According to Millea, there were no reports of unusual odors, and air-quality sampling afterward found no toxic chemicals present outside the plant. No one was reported to have been injured or sickened, or to have sought medical treatment, he added. While the vapor came from inside the plant, its precise origin and cause was under investigation, Millea said.Company spokesman Todd Spitler said an ""upset"" in a refinery unit triggered the release, which was ""primarily composed of steam"" and there was no danger to public health. The Los Angeles City News Service reported the vapor escaped from a leak in an 8-inch line.The company announced last month that it had reached an agreement to sell the Torrance plant and associated facilities, which employ some 1,400 staff and contractors, to New Jersey-based PBF Energy for $537.5 million plus working capital.  The refinery is expected to be back to full production by the time the transaction closes in 2016. The refinery had furnished about 10 percent of California's gasoline supply and its outage helped push Los Angeles-area pump prices to over $4 a gallon in July.(This story has been refiled to fix typo in paragraph 2) (Additional reporting by Erwin Seba in Houston; editing by Jason Neely)",2015-10-24,XOM,"Sat Oct 24, 2015 | 2:57am EDT",Vapor cloud from Exxon refinery in California triggers alarm,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-refinery-operations-exxon-torrance-idUSKCN0SI03O20151024?type=companyNews

The company is planning on roughly 25,000 barrels per day of Bakken crude from North Dakota to be railed into its 85,000 bpd rail terminal in Delaware City, Delaware, Chief Executive Tom Nimbley said on an earnings call. The terminal was completed in 2013, at a time when PBF and other refineries were hailing access to Bakken crude as a savior to the local industry.PBF also expects to continue to rail in between 20,000 bpd and 40,000 bpd of Canadian crude at a separate 40,000 bpd terminal at its Delaware City facility, Nimbley said. The company has a contract with Exxon to deliver 30,000 bpd of crude by rail to the East Coast, but it expects to send about half of those deliveries to its newly acquired Chalmette, Louisiana refinery. The slowdown in rail deliveries comes as the U.S. benchmark oil price discount versus the global benchmark has all but disappeared.The company also said its plans work on a coker unit at its Delaware City refinery in the spring and work on a fluid catalytic cracker at its Paulsboro, New Jersey refinery in the fall.

Crude prices have fallen more than 50 percent from last year's high above $100 a barrel. While the crude decline hurt Exxon's largest oil and gas business, it also boosted profit margins in refining by lowering feedstock costs.""International refining was the surprise that was greater-than-anticipated,"" said Brian Youngberg, senior oil analyst at Edward Jones. ""Refining is the sweet spot for the integrateds this quarter. It reflects their scale and breadth of operations.""To weather the downturn, many of Exxon's peers, including U.S. rival Chevron Corp (CVX.N), are slashing jobs and capital spending.But the world's largest publicly traded oil company is so far keeping its budget forecast intact and plans no restructuring charges, Jeff Woodbury, Exxon's head of investor relations, told analysts on a conference call. In 2015, Exxon expects to spend $34 billion, and less than that in the next two years. Still, Woodbury said spending so far this year is tracking lower than planned, so it is reasonable to conclude that the final number will come in below that forecast, he said.The company will issue its latest capital plan in March, Woodbury said.The Irving, Texas, company posted profit of $4.24 billion, or $1.01 per share, compared with $8.07 billion, or $1.89 per share in the same quarter a year earlier.

537,"  (Adds conference call, analyst commentary)By Anna DriverOct 30 Exxon Mobil Corp said on Friday third-quarter profit fell 47 percent on low crude prices but results were better than expected, helped by higher profit in the oil company's refining business.Crude prices have fallen more than 50 percent from last year's high above $100 a barrel. While the crude decline hurt Exxon's largest oil and gas business, it also boosted profit margins in refining by lowering feedstock costs.""International refining was the surprise that was greater-than-anticipated,"" said Brian Youngberg, senior oil analyst at Edward Jones. ""Refining is the sweet spot for the integrateds this quarter. It reflects their scale and breadth of operations.""To weather the downturn, many of Exxon's peers, including U.S. rival Chevron Corp, are slashing jobs and capital spending. But the world's largest publicly traded oil company is so far keeping its budget forecast intact and plans no restructuring charges, Jeff Woodbury, Exxon's head of investor relations, told analysts on a conference call.In 2015, Exxon expects to spend $34 billion, and less than that in the next two years. Still, Woodbury said spending so far this year is tracking lower than planned, so it is reasonable to conclude that the final number will come in below that forecast, he said.The company will issue its latest capital plan in March, Woodbury said. The Irving, Texas, company posted profit of $4.24 billion, or $1.01 per share, compared with $8.07 billion, or $1.89 per share in the same quarter a year earlier.Analysts on average had expected a profit of 89 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Refining profit nearly doubled from a year earlier to $2 billion in the third quarter, with Exxon's international refining unit turning in better-than-expected earnings of $1.5 billion.Earnings at Exxon's exploration and production business fell $5.1 billion to $1.4 billion.Oil and gas output increased 2.3 percent from a year earlier to 3.9 million oil-equivalent barrels per day (mboed). Exxon is still on track for output totaling 4.1 mboed for the full year, Woodbury told analysts.Shares of Exxon were up 0.8 percent at $82.90 on Friday afternoon.

The pipeline connects Statoil's Aasta Hansteen gas field to the Nyhamna onshore processing plant.       ""There are other projects which typically would have been interesting before (the cut in tariffs), for example Polarled,"" Njord Gas Infrastructure CEO Birte Norheim told Reuters.Infragas CEO Knud Noerve said: ""When it comes to investments outside of Gassled, it is not something we're looking at for the moment ...

543,"  (Repeats for additional subscribers)By David Morgan and Nick CareyWASHINGTON Nov 4 When an Amtrak passenger train derailed in Philadelphia in May, killing eight people and injuring scores more, the railroad industry's campaign to delay a Dec. 31 deadline to install technology to prevent such disasters appeared to be finished.Not, as it turned out, if billionaire investor Warren Buffett and Sen. John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, had anything to do with it. Thune chairs the Senate Commerce Committee, which oversees the rail industry.Last week, under pressure from companies including Buffett's BNSF Railway Co, which has spent more money lobbying Congress this year than any other railroad, U.S. legislators passed, and President Obama signed, a law that delays the so-called positive train control mandate for at least three years, with the possibility of an additional two-year delay.That means railroad operators can put off having to buy and install equipment that safety advocates say would have prevented accidents that have claimed more than 245 lives and caused over 4,200 injuries since the National Transportation Safety Board began calling for the technology in 1969.Railroad advocates presented a blunt argument: Unless the mandate to install positive train control technology was delayed, the railroads would attempt to cripple the economy. Railroads that missed the deadline to install systems that automatically slow or stop a train under dangerous circumstances claimed that they would face heightened liabilities by operating outside of federal law, and that therefore they would decline to carry passengers, including commuters. They wouldn't deliver commodities that are classified as hazardous, but are also vital to the economy - including chemicals like chlorine and ammonia needed to run city water treatment plants, refine oil and keep farms and factories running.BNSF, at $3.9 million, was the biggest spender among individual rail operators as railroads and allies including unions and regional transit authorities spent almost $25 million lobbying Congress on PTC and other issues, according to Senate documents.BNSF, along with Norfolk Southern Corp and Canadian Pacific Railway, referred questions for comment to the Association of American Railroads.""We commend Congress for passing the extension,"" said AAR spokesman Ed Greenburg. ""We have been warning for years that the deadline was unworkable because the technology had to be developed from scratch."" Railroads have spent $6 billion on PTC up to now and expect to spend another $4 billion before implementation is complete, according to the AAR. Opponents of the deal, including Senators Diane Feinstein of California, Chuck Schumer of New York, Ed Markey of Massachusetts and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, all Democrats, found themselves outmaneuvered by the rail industry, aided by Thune and a regulator's favorable interpretation of an obscure law.""It is entirely inappropriate that the railroad industry would make hostages of America's passenger rail services and chemical shippers in order to secure their favored legislative outcome,"" Feinstein said in a statement for the Congressional Record. ""It is offensive that only when a railroad could face full liability for an accident that they find operation without PTC to be unacceptably dangerous.""LOBBYING Lobbying by shippers and other interests, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, drove total spending to almost $113 million over the course of the year. Records show that lobby spending jumped from about $18.5 million in the first quarter to $70 million in the third quarter as the push intensified.Thune said he realized early on that the New Year's Eve deadline could have dire consequences for the economy and for railroads, which were reporting problems with positive train control systems. But after May's Amtrak disaster, ""when they announced that this could have been prevented if they'd had positive train control, there was a real spotlight on why we weren't there and what we could do to get there faster,"" Thune told Reuters in an interview.Meanwhile, the railroads were hampered by anti-trust considerations that prohibited operators from talking directly with each other to launch a collaborative effort.That changed in August after Thune sent letters to the regulatory Surface Transportation Board and individual railroads asking what would happen if the PTC deadline was not extended. His committee then publicized their responses.""That was sort of the seminal moment,"" Thune said. Now the railroads had a channel for their views.Then on Sept. 3, Surface Transportation Board Chairman Daniel Elliott wrote a letter to Thune stating that railroads could be exempt from their federal obligation to provide service to shippers due to issues involving safety. [ID: nL1N11D0EN] The board is an economic regulatory agency charged by Congress with resolving railroad rate and service disputes and reviewing proposed railroad mergers. Less than a week later, major U.S. and Canadian railroads including BNSF, Norfolk Southern and Canadian Pacific began informing Thune that Congress' failure to act on a PTC extension would lead to crippling disruptions for shippers and rail passengers beginning Jan. 1. [ID: nL1N11F2T1]""Everybody thought they were hyping this or overreacting,"" Thune said. Then letters started coming in from shippers, farmers and cities alarmed by the potential disruptions. Railroad executives also raised the issue in quarterly calls with investors.Soon, members of Congress were hearing from a host of industries -- automakers, oil companies, high-tech firms, farmers, water treatment facilities and even the makers of bullet-proof vests. The American Chemistry Council, the National Association of Manufacturers and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce weighed in on the railroads' behalf.Household names and giant employers including Exxon Mobil, Chevron, Cisco Systems, General Electric, Cargill Inc and Land O' Lakes joined the fray.""I started having members coming up to me and saying, What are we going to do about this and how are we going to fix this? Democrats and Republicans,"" Thune said.That left it to four members of Congress - all of them big beneficiaries of rail industry campaign contributions - to work out a deal that could win bipartisan support in both the Senate and the House of Representatives. They then pushed to attach it to a must-pass short-term extension to the Highway Trust Fund.The four were Thune and the Senate Commerce Committee's top Democrat Bill Nelson of Florida, the House Transportation Committee's Republican chairman Bill Shuster of Pennsylvania and that panel's top Democrat, Peter DeFazio of Oregon.Together, the four have received $1.2 million rail industry campaign contributions during their Capitol Hill careers, with about two-thirds of that sum going to the two Republicans, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics.The measure passed both chambers on simple voice votes that meant individual lawmakers didn't have their positions recorded. Supporters said that showed near universal support for the measure.    (Reporting by David Morgan in Washington and Nick Carey in Chicago.

Thune chairs the Senate Commerce Committee, which oversees the rail industry.Last week, under pressure from companies including Buffett's BNSF Railway Co, which has spent more money lobbying Congress this year than any other railroad, U.S. legislators passed, and President Obama signed, a law that delays the so-called positive train control mandate for at least three years, with the possibility of an additional two-year delay.That means railroad operators can put off having to buy and install equipment that safety advocates say would have prevented accidents that have claimed more than 245 lives and caused over 4,200 injuries since the National Transportation Safety Board began calling for the technology in 1969.Railroad advocates presented a blunt argument: Unless the mandate to install positive train control technology was delayed, the railroads would attempt to cripple the economy. Railroads that missed the deadline to install systems that automatically slow or stop a train under dangerous circumstances claimed that they would face heightened liabilities by operating outside of federal law, and that therefore they would decline to carry passengers, including commuters. They wouldn't deliver commodities that are classified as hazardous, but are also vital to the economy - including chemicals like chlorine and ammonia needed to run city water treatment plants, refine oil and keep farms and factories running.BNSF, at $3.9 million, was the biggest spender among individual rail operators as railroads and allies including unions and regional transit authorities spent almost $25 million lobbying Congress on PTC and other issues, according to Senate documents.BNSF, along with Norfolk Southern Corp and Canadian Pacific Railway, referred questions for comment to the Association of American Railroads.""We commend Congress for passing the extension,"" said AAR spokesman Ed Greenburg. ""We have been warning for years that the deadline was unworkable because the technology had to be developed from scratch."" Railroads have spent $6 billion on PTC up to now and expect to spend another $4 billion before implementation is complete, according to the AAR.Opponents of the deal, including Senators Diane Feinstein of California, Chuck Schumer of New York, Ed Markey of Massachusetts and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, all Democrats, found themselves outmaneuvered by the rail industry, aided by Thune and a regulator's favorable interpretation of an obscure law. ""It is entirely inappropriate that the railroad industry would make hostages of America's passenger rail services and chemical shippers in order to secure their favored legislative outcome,"" Feinstein said in a statement for the Congressional Record. ""It is offensive that only when a railroad could face full liability for an accident that they find operation without PTC to be unacceptably dangerous.""LOBBYING Lobbying by shippers and other interests, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, drove total spending to almost $113 million over the course of the year. Records show that lobby spending jumped from about $18.5 million in the first quarter to $70 million in the third quarter as the push intensified.Thune said he realized early on that the New Year's Eve deadline could have dire consequences for the economy and for railroads, which were reporting problems with positive train control systems.But after May's Amtrak disaster, ""when they announced that this could have been prevented if they'd had positive train control, there was a real spotlight on why we weren't there and what we could do to get there faster,"" Thune told Reuters in an interview. Meanwhile, the railroads were hampered by anti-trust considerations that prohibited operators from talking directly with each other to launch a collaborative effort.That changed in August after Thune sent letters to the regulatory Surface Transportation Board and individual railroads asking what would happen if the PTC deadline was not extended. His committee then publicized their responses.""That was sort of the seminal moment,"" Thune said. Now the railroads had a channel for their views.Then on Sept. 3, Surface Transportation Board Chairman Daniel Elliott wrote a letter to Thune stating that railroads could be exempt from their federal obligation to provide service to shippers due to issues involving safety. [ID: nL1N11D0EN] The board is an economic regulatory agency charged by Congress with resolving railroad rate and service disputes and reviewing proposed railroad mergers. Less than a week later, major U.S. and Canadian railroads including BNSF, Norfolk Southern and Canadian Pacific began informing Thune that Congress' failure to act on a PTC extension would lead to crippling disruptions for shippers and rail passengers beginning Jan. 1. [ID: nL1N11F2T1]""Everybody thought they were hyping this or overreacting,"" Thune said. Then letters started coming in from shippers, farmers and cities alarmed by the potential disruptions. Railroad executives also raised the issue in quarterly calls with investors.Soon, members of Congress were hearing from a host of industries -- automakers, oil companies, high-tech firms, farmers, water treatment facilities and even the makers of bullet-proof vests. The American Chemistry Council, the National Association of Manufacturers and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce weighed in on the railroads' behalf.Household names and giant employers including Exxon Mobil, Chevron, Cisco Systems, General Electric, Cargill Inc and Land O' Lakes joined the fray.""I started having members coming up to me and saying, What are we going to do about this and how are we going to fix this? Democrats and Republicans,"" Thune said.That left it to four members of Congress - all of them big beneficiaries of rail industry campaign contributions - to work out a deal that could win bipartisan support in both the Senate and the House of Representatives. They then pushed to attach it to a must-pass short-term extension to the Highway Trust Fund.The four were Thune and the Senate Commerce Committee's top Democrat Bill Nelson of Florida, the House Transportation Committee's Republican chairman Bill Shuster of Pennsylvania and that panel's top Democrat, Peter DeFazio of Oregon.Together, the four have received $1.2 million rail industry campaign contributions during their Capitol Hill careers, with about two-thirds of that sum going to the two Republicans, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics.The measure passed both chambers on simple voice votes that meant individual lawmakers didn't have their positions recorded. Supporters said that showed near universal support for the measure.    (Reporting by David Morgan in Washington and Nick Carey in Chicago.

549,"   By Kevin Allison and Ben Kellerman  The company's approach to the climate debate has already been in the headlines of late. The Los Angeles Times and others have detailed how Exxon factored into its operations the financial risks of climate change unearthed by its own research, but kept quiet about it publicly. Schneiderman's 18-page subpoena, which is demanding documents dating all the way back to 1977, is also well timed: United Nations-sponsored international climate talks start in Paris at the end of the month.The investigation may well spread beyond Exxon. Several oil groups now use internal carbon pricing for their assets, brag about renewable energy investments and are disclosing more information about the effects of climate change on their business - often in response to concerted shareholder demands. But that has only happened in recent years, leaving plenty of room for the likes of Schneiderman to explore.It's not just potential legal bills that shareholders should be concerned about, though. The prospect of climate change stranding energy-company assets is becoming more real. Companies and governments around the world own five times more coal, oil and gas reserves than can safely be burned without exceeding internationally agreed climate targets, according to a 2011 study by Carbon Tracker, a think tank.If world leaders ever get serious about tackling global warming, these assets will end up stuck in the ground, meaning the only thing getting burned will be the billions of dollars spent to acquire and develop them. The top 200 oil, gas and mining companies allocated an estimated $674 billion to finding reserves and developing new extraction methods in just 12 months from 2012 to 2013, according to Carbon Tracker. These all appear to be non-issues to most investors, though. Exxon's shares slipped just 1.4 percent after news of the probe broke on Thursday, only slightly more than their average daily change over the last month. The change in the oil price remains, it seems, shareholders' main concern. That may prove to be shortsighted.

556,"  (Repeats story published Friday to widen distribution)     By Mica Rosenberg     NEW YORK, Nov 9 A near century-old statute that gives New York state prosecutors unusually broad authority to prosecute securities fraud could prove a powerful weapon as Attorney General Eric Schneiderman probes Exxon Mobil Corp  over whether the oil firm mislead the public and shareholders about the perils of climate change.     The 1921 Martin Act, a wide-reaching state law, was dusted off in the early 2000s by former New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer who used it to aggressively go after Wall Street firms.     Since then, it has been used to prosecute large-scale Ponzi schemes, major investment banks accused of misleading investors and other cases.     Now, Schneiderman is wielding the statute in his probe of Exxon, the world's largest publicly traded oil company, according to a source familiar with the matter. The source said other state laws could be used as well.     Schneiderman subpoenaed Exxon on Wednesday, demanding extensive financial records, emails and other documents to probe the company's knowledge and disclosures about climate change going back to the 1970s.      In response to the probe, Exxon has said it has worked on climate science in a transparent way for nearly 40 years and has regularly disclosed the business risks of climate change to investors for years.       The investigation comes on top of reports last month by Inside Climate News and the Los Angeles Times that the company's own scientists had raised concerns about global warming decades ago that the company executives contradicted.     Under the Martin Act, the state must prove that a company deceived the public by misrepresenting or omitting a material fact in the offering of securities.     Lawyers say the act is unique in that no proof of intent to deceive is required to bring a claim, and prosecutors do not even need to show that anyone was in fact defrauded. The act allows for criminal as well as civil charges.     New York State's highest court ruled in 1926 that it covers ""all deceitful practices contrary to the plain rules of common honesty.""      The act ""is one of the broadest anti-fraud statutes ever devised, at least in a democratic society,"" wrote Eric Dinallo, a chief prosecutor under former Attorney General Spitzer, in the New York University Journal of Legislation and Public Policy.     It has been used to extract large monetary penalties from finical institutions, said Jim McGuire, a litigation partner at the Dechert law firm in New York.      ""The Martin Act is a nearly empty vessel into which the AG can pour virtually any content that he wants,"" McGuire said.     Exxon did not comment on Friday when asked about the Martin Act.           CALLS FROM CONGRESS      U.S. congressman have called for the U.S. Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate the claims against Exxon as well, saying the company's alleged failure to disclose scientific findings was similar to tobacco companies that concealed the harms of smoking.     Democratic California representatives Ted Lieu and Mark DeSaulnier, along with other lawmakers, asked the U.S. Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate Exxon. In interviews they said they hoped other state attorneys general would follow New York's lead.     ""My view is that this should be even more serious than tobacco, if it's the whole world that's being harmed,"" said Lieu.       Lieu also circulated a letter to lawmakers citing an investigation by the Union of Concerned Scientists, a U.S. non-profit organization, that said other oil companies also had spread misinformation about global warming.     Both the SEC and the U.S. Attorney General's office in California declined to comment on whether they were pursuing investigations of their own over Exxon's climate statements.     Unlike the Martin Act in New York, prosecutors would have to overcome a ""far higher bar"" to bring a federal case, said McGuire, who previously served as chief counsel to former New York Governor George Pataki.      Federal securities fraud under SEC rules require a showing of scienter, a legal term for intent or knowledge of wrongdoing.

557,"  (Repeats story published Friday to widen distribution)     By Mica Rosenberg     NEW YORK, Nov 7 A near century-old statute that gives New York state prosecutors unusually broad authority to prosecute securities fraud could prove a powerful weapon as Attorney General Eric Schneiderman probes Exxon Mobil Corp  over whether the oil firm mislead the public and shareholders about the perils of climate change.     The 1921 Martin Act, a wide-reaching state law, was dusted off in the early 2000s by former New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer who used it to aggressively go after Wall Street firms.     Since then, it has been used to prosecute large-scale Ponzi schemes, major investment banks accused of misleading investors and other cases.     Now, Schneiderman is wielding the statute in his probe of Exxon, the world's largest publicly traded oil company, according to a source familiar with the matter. The source said other state laws could be used as well.     Schneiderman subpoenaed Exxon on Wednesday, demanding extensive financial records, emails and other documents to probe the company's knowledge and disclosures about climate change going back to the 1970s.      In response to the probe, Exxon has said it has worked on climate science in a transparent way for nearly 40 years and has regularly disclosed the business risks of climate change to investors for years.       The investigation comes on top of reports last month by Inside Climate News and the Los Angeles Times that the company's own scientists had raised concerns about global warming decades ago that the company executives contradicted.     Under the Martin Act, the state must prove that a company deceived the public by misrepresenting or omitting a material fact in the offering of securities.     Lawyers say the act is unique in that no proof of intent to deceive is required to bring a claim, and prosecutors do not even need to show that anyone was in fact defrauded. The act allows for criminal as well as civil charges.     New York State's highest court ruled in 1926 that it covers ""all deceitful practices contrary to the plain rules of common honesty.""      The act ""is one of the broadest anti-fraud statutes ever devised, at least in a democratic society,"" wrote Eric Dinallo, a chief prosecutor under former Attorney General Spitzer, in the New York University Journal of Legislation and Public Policy.     It has been used to extract large monetary penalties from finical institutions, said Jim McGuire, a litigation partner at the Dechert law firm in New York.      ""The Martin Act is a nearly empty vessel into which the AG can pour virtually any content that he wants,"" McGuire said.     Exxon did not comment on Friday when asked about the Martin Act.           CALLS FROM CONGRESS      U.S. congressman have called for the U.S. Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate the claims against Exxon as well, saying the company's alleged failure to disclose scientific findings was similar to tobacco companies that concealed the harms of smoking.     Democratic California representatives Ted Lieu and Mark DeSaulnier, along with other lawmakers, asked the U.S. Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate Exxon. In interviews they said they hoped other state attorneys general would follow New York's lead.     ""My view is that this should be even more serious than tobacco, if it's the whole world that's being harmed,"" said Lieu.       Lieu also circulated a letter to lawmakers citing an investigation by the Union of Concerned Scientists, a U.S. non-profit organization, that said other oil companies also had spread misinformation about global warming.     Both the SEC and the U.S. Attorney General's office in California declined to comment on whether they were pursuing investigations of their own over Exxon's climate statements.     Unlike the Martin Act in New York, prosecutors would have to overcome a ""far higher bar"" to bring a federal case, said McGuire, who previously served as chief counsel to former New York Governor George Pataki.      Federal securities fraud under SEC rules require a showing of scienter, a legal term for intent or knowledge of wrongdoing.     Daniel Riesel, a white-collar defense attorney at Sive, Paget & Riesel said that the tobacco cases actually highlighted the challenges in bringing federal enforcement actions against companies over climate change claims.

567,"   By Terry Wade and Valerie Volcovici | NEW YORK/WASHINGTON  NEW YORK/WASHINGTON The New York state attorney general's office, which told Peabody Energy this week to give investors more details about how its sales would suffer from measures to curb global warming, is now mulling whether the tactic it used with the coal firm could be applied to companies beyond the energy sector.The state investigation into Peabody, which was settled on Monday, found that the company repeatedly denied in public filings it could predict how potential climate change regulations would affect its business, even though its internal studies showed revenue could tumble if coal were targeted in a carbon pollution crackdown.New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman seized upon this discrepancy between public and private pronouncements as a violation of securities laws, arguing that material facts were withheld.While the settlement will pressure other fossil fuel companies to bolster their climate change disclosures, it also could spawn new pressures on a range of companies facing regulatory risks over policy issues from obesity to soaring drug prices, according to corporate governance experts including James Cox, a law professor at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina.""This is sweeping,"" Cox said. ""I think there will be a ripple effect from this.""Schneiderman's office has considered the effects the Peabody settlement could have on disclosure practices for companies outside the energy industry, though no additional actions are planned at the moment, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters.At least one other case similar to Peabody is in the works in New York, where Schneiderman's office last week was reported to have opened an inquiry into whether Exxon Mobil Corp  misled shareholders about climate change risks. U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission disclosure guidelines give companies considerable leeway to make their own judgments about the likelihood that future events, such as tougher regulations, will affect their valuations.WHAT'S MATERIAL The Peabody settlement, while not binding for corporate America, could prompt companies to reexamine what they are defining as material to shareholders, at a time when demands by investors for more robust disclosures are growing, corporate governance experts said. For example, soda makers could see a crackdown on sugary drinks by governments worried about public health, or changes in insurance rules might result in lower drug prices paid to pharmaceutical companies, they said""There is this horrible mismatch between what companies know about their own businesses and what they tell investors in mandatory public filings.

572,"   By Jarrett Renshaw and Kevin Jose  The California Division of Occupational Safety and Health (CAL/OSHA) said on Tuesday that it lifted an order prohibiting the use of a fluid catalytic cracking unit and electrostatic precipitator at Exxon's refinery in Torrance, California.PBF Energy recently agreed to buy the Torrance refinery from Exxon and the deal is expected to close in the second quarter of 2016 after the plant is restored to its full working order. The prohibition was placed on the fluid catalytic cracking unit on Feb. 18, following an explosion at the 149,500-barrel-per-day (bpd) Torrance refinery. In the aftermath of the explosion price of gasoline in Los Angeles surged to its highest level in about 18 months and sent February deliveries of California gasoline, known as CARBOB, as high as 40 cents above futures. Cal/OSHA added that Exxon Mobil now has a green light to operate the electrostatic precipitator once it is repaired and installed.The Process Safety Management (PSM) unit of Cal/OSHA spent three months reviewing Exxon Mobil's pre-startup safety review on the fluid catalytic cracking unit which includes the electrostatic precipitator.",2015-11-25,XOM,"Tue Nov 24, 2015 | 7:41pm EST",California lifts order prohibiting use of FCCU and ESP at Exxon Torrance refinery,http://www.reuters.com//article/refinery-operations-exxon-mobil-torrance-idUSL1N13K02B20151125?type=companyNews
573,"  MELBOURNE Up to $2 trillion in petroleum and coal projects will not be needed if the world takes action to limit warming of the planet to 2 degrees Celsius, according to a report released this week ahead of a global climate summit in Paris.The report adds to a string of studies warning investors that measures to curb carbon emissions will hit earnings at coal, oil and gas companies as the world shifts to cleaner energy.Europe's largest insurer, Allianz SE, this week joined a growing number of institutional investors like California's pension funds and Norway's sovereign wealth fund, to sell off coal investments.Analyzing industry databases, environmental think tank Carbon Tracker Initiative (CTI) found the three biggest losers would be Mexico's Petroleos Mexicanos (PEMEX) [PEMX.UL], with $77 billion in unneeded projects, Royal Dutch Shell, with nearly the same, and ExxonMobil with $73 billion in potentially stranded projects.Petroleum companies are worse off than coal companies as their projects are typically much more expensive, it said.Shell and ExxonMobil said they could not comment on the report as they had not seen it, but both said the world will need oil and gas to help meet growing energy demand. ""All of ExxonMobil's current hydrocarbon reserves will be needed, along with substantial future industry investments,"" spokesman Alan Jeffers said.Shell, critical of previous Carbon Tracker reports, said investment is needed just to replace natural decline in existing oil and gas fields. Pemex was not immediately available for comment.From the point of view of cutting carbon emissions, coal producers are much more vulnerable as the carbon saved by not developing their projects is much greater, Carbon Tracker said. However, from an investor viewpoint, oil companies faced a higher risk given the greater cost of their projects, said Mark Fulton, a former investment banker who worked with CTI on the research.He pinpointed two ""carbon basins"" - oil sands in Canada and the Galilee Basin in Australia, where two Indian conglomerates are looking to dig mines - as regions whose assets will not be needed. In a separate report released on Monday, another non-profit think tank, CDP, ranked Glencore Plc as the worst prepared for a low carbon economy among 11 major listed miners, based on measures including energy efficiency, resilience to water shortages, exposure to coal and carbon price exposure.Glencore said it was disappointed with the findings and said its climate change scores from CDP had improved over a number of years, beating the industry average in an earlier CDP report.

But Exxon's decision to hire such a heavy hitter signals it views the matter seriously.

He also previously represented former New York Governor Elliot Spitzer and Scooter Libby, a former official in the administration of President George W.

579,"   By Patrick Rucker | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Exxon Mobil Corp has not shared information about its U.S. taxes with a global transparency effort that the company has endorsed and that President Barack Obama has backed, the project's organizers said on Wednesday.Exxon was one of several energy companies that failed to share U.S.-specific tax information for a report released on Wednesday by the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), which audits payments made by companies for drilling or mining.EITI is a watchdog group that targets corruption in energy and mineral-rich nations with impoverished populations.Obama in 2011 committed the United States to the effort, saying it would help ensure ""that taxpayers receive every dollar they're due."" The president's commitment came while endorsing the Open Government Partnership, an even broader good-government effort conceived that same year.Exxon(XOM.N), one of the world's largest corporations, has a seat on the EITI board and has pledged to disclose payments it makes around the world. The company discloses tax and royalty information in many countries but will not say what it pays the Internal Revenue Service, according to EITI findings released on Wednesday.Exxon did not report its U.S. federal corporate income tax payments for 2013, the year under review, according to the EITI. Exxon spokesman William F. Holbrook said the company had no comment on the EITI initiative while that ""work is still in progress."" He said Exxon is ""one of the largest taxpayers in the U.S. and around the world.""U.S. corporations are not legally required to disclose their U.S. federal income tax payments publicly and most do not. But they do routinely disclose their global effective tax rates and other accounting.

580,"   By Patrick Rucker | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Dec 2 Exxon Mobil Corp has not shared information about its U.S. taxes with a global transparency effort that the company has endorsed and that President Barack Obama has backed, the project's organizers said on Wednesday.Exxon was one of several energy companies that failed to share U.S.-specific tax information for a report released on Wednesday by the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), which audits payments made by companies for drilling or mining.EITI is a watchdog group that targets corruption in energy and mineral-rich nations with impoverished populations.Obama in 2011 committed the United States to the effort, saying it would help ensure ""that taxpayers receive every dollar they're due."" The president's commitment came while endorsing the Open Government Partnership, an even broader good-government effort conceived that same year.Exxon, one of the world's largest corporations, has a seat on the EITI board and has pledged to disclose payments it makes around the world. The company discloses tax and royalty information in many countries but will not say what it pays the Internal Revenue Service, according to EITI findings released on Wednesday.Exxon did not report its U.S. federal corporate income tax payments for 2013, the year under review, according to the EITI. Exxon spokesman William F. Holbrook said the company had no comment on the EITI initiative while that ""work is still in progress."" He said Exxon is ""one of the largest taxpayers in the U.S. and around the world."" U.S. corporations are not legally required to disclose their U.S. federal income tax payments publicly and most do not. But they do routinely disclose their global effective tax rates and other accounting.Under the EITI protocol, however, energy companies that participate, including Exxon, commit to disclosing meaningful payments they make to governments.Exxon and other EITI participants are expected later this month to formally endorse Wednesday's report.

581,"   By Katie Reilly  Public corporations are supposed to warn investors about the risk to their businesses from climate change, but the tone and wording of those disclosures vary widely among big U.S. manufacturing, automotive and energy companies, according to company documents, and legal and corporate governance experts.Pressure on companies to inform investors about risks associated with climate change was intensifying even before New York state's attorney general disclosed last month that he was investigating ExxonMobil Corp for its handling of such disclosures.The Securities and Exchange Commission in 2010 issued guidance that companies could be required to address climate risks depending on laws, regulations, international treaties, the consequences of business trends or the potential physical impacts of climate events.Environmentalists say the SEC guidance gives companies too much latitude.""There's a huge gap between what companies know and what they're disclosing,"" said Andrew Logan, director of oil and gas and insurance programs for Ceres, a nonprofit group that works with companies and investors to address environmental concerns. A spokeswoman for the SEC declined to comment. Ceres found that 41 percent of S&P 500 companies did not include any climate-related disclosure in their 10-K filings - annual reports to the SEC - in 2013. Some companies that do address climate change do so indirectly.In its 2014 10-K filing, General Electric did not mention “climate change” but identified regulations, including environmental ones, as a risk factor. GE also wrote that environmental obligations could cut into profits. The company further addressed climate change in a separate sustainability report, a spokesman said.American Electric Power, one of the largest utility companies in the United States with many coal-fired plants, began disclosing information about climate change risk in at least its 2008 10-K filing, a company spokeswoman said. ""Regulation of CO2 emissions could materially increase costs to us and our customers or cause some of our electric generating units to be uneconomical to operate or maintain,"" the company wrote in a 2014 filing. Auto giant General Motors did not mention the words “climate change” in its 2014 10-K filing but warned that regulations related to greenhouse gas emissions “may have a significant effect on how we do business.” A spokeswoman for General Motors said the company has been transparent in addressing climate change in a variety of public documents, including 10-K forms, sustainability reports and press releases. For its part, Exxon has said it worked on climate science in a transparent way for nearly 40 years and has regularly disclosed the business risks of climate change to investors. The company mentioned climate change and greenhouse gas restrictions as a risk in its 2014 10-K filing. “These requirements could make our products more expensive, lengthen project implementation times, and reduce demand for hydrocarbons, as well as shift hydrocarbon demand toward relatively lower-carbon sources such as natural gas,” the company wrote.

583,"  (Adds comments from news conference)By Huw JonesLONDON Dec 4 A global task force is to encourage businesses to make voluntary disclosures to help investors compare the risks that they face from climate change, Financial Stability Board Chairman Mark Carney said on Friday.The FSB drafts global financial regulation for the Group of 20 economies (G20), whose summit in Turkey last month asked the board to look at how the financial sector can take account of climate-related issues.Already, U.S. judicial authorities have begun forcing fossil fuel firms to disclose their own assessments of the risks they face from any increased regulation of greenhouse gas emissions to limit climate change.""Access to high-quality financial information will allow market participants and policymakers to understand and better manage those risks, which are likely to grow with time,"" Carney said at the Paris climate conference.In September, Carney, who is also governor of the Bank of England, said one of the reasons for better disclosure was the risk that large assets such as fossil-fuel reserves could be ""stranded"" and rapidly lose value as the world tries to wean itself off carbon. ""What we don't want to see is an abrupt transition,"" he told a news conference on Friday.The task force will be chaired by Michael Bloomberg, former mayor of New York and now the U.N. Secretary General's special envoy for cities and climate change.About 10 people will determine the scope and main objectives by the end of March. Another 20 will draft specific recommendations for voluntary disclosure principles and best practices by the end of 2016. The report will consider the physical, liability and transition risks associated with climate change, and what constitutes effective financial disclosure.Carney said the cost of weather-related claims for Britain's insurance sector had gone up five-fold since the 1980s.The FSB said there were currently 400 disclosure systems relating to climate or sustainability. ""We run the risk of getting lost in the right direction,"" Carney said.The New York state attorney general said last month that he was investigating oil giant Exxon Mobil Corp for the way it had disclosed risks associated with climate change in its statutory reporting.A few weeks earlier, the same attorney general used securities law to order coal producer Peabody Energy to give investors more details about how its sales would suffer from measures to curb global warming.Carney said giving investors more insight into firms' exposure to and preparedness for climate change would plug a ""market failure"" and smooth the transition to a low-carbon economy.""The one thing we are not doing as a regulator is making a judgement that there are bad industries from a climate perspective and you should not be lending to those industries,"" Carney said.(Writing by Huw Jones in London; Editing by Kevin Liffey)",2015-12-04,XOM,"Fri Dec 4, 2015 | 10:14am EST",UPDATE 1-G20 sets up task force to get firms to disclose climate risks,http://www.reuters.com//article/climatechange-summit-g20-fsb-idUSL8N13T2AU20151204?type=companyNews
584,"  * City analyst found asset prices ignored risk of lower carbon use* Idea arose of ""stranded"" carbon that might never be extracted* Issue became financial, not moral, one* Disinvestment and pressure to disclose carbon risks growingBy Nina Chestney and Bruce WallacePARIS, Dec 7 Poring over a Bangladeshi flood map as a London financial analyst 12 years ago, Mark Campanale had no idea the moment would spawn a financial concept powerful enough to rivet central bankers, anger oil moguls and fuel a grassroots movement to get investors to dump their fossil fuel holdings.The map was in the prospectus of a British firm seeking to raise money to build a coal-fired power plant in Bangladesh. Not only was Campanale angry that a company would pump more carbon emissions into the air from a low-lying country vulnerable to climate change in the form of rising sea levels; he was also mystified that investors didn't see the financial risks that went with it.""I was offended that the markets weren't picking up the risks, given what we knew about coal and climate change,"" Campanale recalls. ""I thought: 'This is mad'.""More than a decade later, Campanale's eureka moment has grown into a powerful - and vigorously contested - theory: that energy investors are sitting on a $2 trillion ""carbon bubble"" because vast amounts of coal, oil and gas companies' reserves will never be extracted if the world is to limit itself to a rise in global temperatures of 2 degrees Celsius over pre-industrial levels.The concept has rippled out from that Bangladeshi map to become part of the climate change lexicon. It has formed the basis for warnings about ""stranded assets"" by Bank of England Governor Mark Carney and inspired groups like Norway's sovereign wealth fund to divest billions in fossil fuel holdings.It has also been embraced by green activists usually hostile to market solutions for climate change, igniting a global campaign to get investors to divest from fossil fuels. It has resonated across global climate change talks in Paris this week, even if it has not yet entered the formal agenda.MONEY NOT MORALITY The concept ""shifted the argument fundamentally from an ethical or moral issue into one which has an impact on risk to portfolios"", says Charlie Thomas, manager of Jupiter Asset Management's Ecology Fund, valued at 429 million pounds ($648 million).Fossil fuel companies vigorously dispute the claim that their assets will ever be stranded, many saying the phrase is a political lever for radical green activists, not a lens for serious financial analysis. Oil and gas firms bristle at being lumped into the debate alongside carbon-intensive coal. But Campanale maintains the pioneering work he and his colleagues conducted was never about politics.""We weren't thinking of a political narrative at all,"" he says. ""We said there are risks riddled across the system, and that the answer to the carbon bubble was to address the regulatory challenges.""In the years following the Bangladeshi prospectus, Campanale began honing the issue with Nick Robins, a former HSBC analyst, and Jeremy Leggett, an oil and gas consultant-turned-environmental-activist. In the early days, they called the phenomenon ""unusable reserves"". It didn't stick.After the failed 2009 climate summit in Copenhagen, Leggett wrote an opinion piece in Britain's Guardian newspaper highlighting long-term risks to coal investments. The article caught the attention of Joanna Messing, executive director of the Growald Family Fund, a philanthropic fund co-founded by the youngest child of David Rockefeller.Messing made a cold call to Leggett, asking about his theory and ""whether he had an idea about how to take action"", she said.Funding from the Rockefellers and others quickly followed, allowing Campanale, Leggett and ex-WWF policy adviser James Leaton in 2010 to launch Carbon Tracker, a London-based think tank focused on the financial impact of climate change. THE BUBBLE SURFACES Their breakthrough was a 2011 report called ""Unburnable Carbon - are the world's financial markets carrying a carbon bubble?"", which concluded that 80 per cent of world's reserves would have to stay in the ground if the world was to meet its 2 degree target.Carbon Tracker printed only a hundred or so copies, distributing them to London investment managers and analysts.""I did think at the time that, once we'd launched the research, it was 'job done',"" Campanale said.But they pushed the concept at financial gatherings, lobbying executives at the annual Davos Economic Forum and wooing Bank of England chief economist Andrew Haldane with the idea of a sub-prime mortgage-style threat to the financial system.It was their Rockefeller connection that introduced the concept to American activist circles. A program director at the Rockefeller Brothers Fund gave one of the copies to Canadian author and activist Naomi Klein, who passed it along to prominent U.S. environmentalist Bill McKibben.McKibben, a long-time writer on climate change who converted his network of readers into the powerful 350.org grassroots movement, says it took him some time to work out the report's significance. But the following summer, his article ""Global Warming's Terrifying New Math"", published in Rolling Stone magazine, introduced the carbon bubble to a new audience of students and church groups, grist for their nascent campaigns to get investors to divest from fossil fuels.FROM ROLLING STONE TO SNOWBALL It was ""maybe the most-shared thing I'd written since my original book on climate change way back in 1989,"" McKibben said.The religious Sisters of St. Dominic of Caldwell, New Jersey, got the message. In April 2013, they proposed a resolution at ExxonMobil's shareholder meeting arguing that ""sooner or later, restrictions on carbon emissions will be necessary"", according to Exxon's SEC filing.""This has led economists to fear a 'carbon bubble' as current investments may be stranded,"" they wrote. The motion was rejected by 73.3 percent, but the phrase had been used in a U.S. disclosure for the first time.In the last few months alone, New York's attorney general has forced one coal concern, Peabody, to disclose its own assessments of the risks it faces from any increased regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, and begun investigating oil giant Exxon Mobil Corp on similar grounds.After first ignoring the issue, the energy industry has begun to fight back, though splits have appeared in the process.Oil and gas companies, especially in Europe, increasingly distance themselves from coal, which they regard as far more vulnerable to the bubble argument.""Of the 2.8 trillion tonnes of carbon bubble, two-thirds of it is coal,"" Royal Dutch Shell's chief financial officer Simon Henry told Reuters. He says only 1.5 percent of the total is held by international oil and gas companies. ""This idea of stranded assets is just arithmetic nonsense.""Indeed, coal is suffering most. On the eve of the Paris conference, a $34 billion state pension fund in Sweden pulled out of 28 coal companies, and Allianz, Europe's biggest insurance firm, said it would cease investing in coal-heavy mining and utility firms.""What was an obscure report three years ago is now the talking points of the World Bank, the IMF and so on,"" says McKibben.

589,"  WASHINGTON Dec 15 An Obama administration official said on Tuesday that he expects that leading energy companies like Exxon Mobil Corp will next year disclose what they pay in U.S. taxes.Exxon was one of 30 energy companies that earlier this month rebuffed a U.S. call to publish what they pay in taxes when they drill or mine.Leaders of that auditing effort, the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), faulted oil and gas companies for holding back tax information. But next year will be different, said Greg Gould who collects energy revenue for the U.S. Interior Department.""The status quo is not going to hold. We are moving forward,"" said Gould, director of the Office of Natural Resources Revenue.On Friday, the Securities and Exchange Commission outlined how oil, gas and mining companies could disclose government payments and so satisfy a provision of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law. Gould said he monitored the SEC meeting last week and was ""very happy with what I heard.""Specifically, the SEC would require energy companies to give a detailed accounting of what they pay governments from each energy patch. Leaders of the oil and gas sector have sued to block the SEC rules in the past and may do so again.""We are weighing our options,"" a spokesman for the American Petroleum Institute, a leading industry voice, said. A spokesman for Exxon directed Reuters to the API statement.Gould said he expected the SEC disclosure rule would come into force within months and that the public would benefit from the increased disclosure.""This is the public's money and to have a process that is very transparent and open with how that money comes in and how it's dispersed is critical to all of us,"" Gould said.(Reporting by Patrick Rucker; Editing by Peter Cooney)",2015-12-15,XOM,"Tue Dec 15, 2015 | 5:52pm EST","U.S. official expects Exxon, other oil firms, to share tax data",http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-exxon-mobil-taxes-idUSL1N1442RD20151215?type=companyNews
590,"   By Anna Driver | HOUSTON  HOUSTON Dec 14 Exxon Mobil Corp's appointment of the head of its refining business as its new president makes him the probable successor to Chief Executive Rex Tillerson and was designed to avoid raising eyebrows on Wall Street, analysts said on Monday.The new president, Darren Woods, 50, a 23-year company veteran, and exploration and production executive Jack Williams, were named to Exxon's expanded five-member management committee in 2014. The two are further from the company's mandatory retirement age of 65 than the others on the panel.At the time, some insiders said Williams, who spent time at Exxon's fracking unit XTO, was a likely successor to Tillerson.Since then, tumbling prices have prompted many shale oil producers to shrink, while refiners have posted solid profits.The Irving, Texas, company's conservative approach to succession planning, which involves promoting from within and grooming engineers fresh out of college, contrasts starkly with the tumultuous change seen in some U.S. boardrooms. Cheniere Energy Inc founder Charif Souki was ousted as CEO on Sunday after activist board members opposed his plans to expand the company beyond its core business of exporting super-chilled natural gas..At Yahoo Inc, the Internet company's board scrapped the centerpiece of CEO Marissa Mayer's turnaround strategy - the planned spinoff of its stake in Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.""Nobody gets to be the CEO of Exxon by rocking the boat,"" said Raymond James analyst Pavel Molchanov. ""Over the last several successions, from Lee Raymond to Rex Tillerson, it's essentially been status quo."" Molchanov said investors believed any member of Exxon's management bench could generate cash for shareholders. It had $32.5 billion in profit last year and distributed $23.6 billion to shareholders.Woods, an electrical engineer with a degree from Texas A&M, became president of Exxon Mobil Refining & Supply in 2012. A transition is expected at the end of 2016, before Tillerson faces retirement in 2017, analysts said.Technically all five members of the committee are eligible to replace him.Analysts said Exxon may need a steady hand as it faces a collapse in crude oil prices, an investigation by the New York state attorney general into the company's climate risk disclosures, and a global deal by governments to curb emissions.""Obviously Exxon feels he's the best candidate to lead the company into the future, which has a lot of uncertainty around it related to carbon,"" Edward Jones analyst Brian Youngberg said of Woods.Exxon shares rose 2.3 percent to $74.34 on Monday.

592,"   By Ron Bousso, Karolin Schaps and Sinead Cruise | LONDON  LONDON Royal Dutch Shell's takeover of BG Group may look less attractive after the slide in oil prices but the fact the same investors own nearly half of both firms means the deal is still likely to go through.Investors holding about 43 percent of Shell's shares also hold 53 percent of BG, according to Reuters data. For example, Blackrock, Franklin Mutual Advisers and Norges together hold more than 12 percent of Shell and nearly 7.5 percent of BG.Investors will be voting separately on the deal at meetings expected next month after the takeover received its final regulatory seal from China this week and a rejection of the takeover could entail losses all round, making it more painful for those with shares in both companies.BG shares would likely collapse, while Shell would lose a rare opportunity to increase its production base over the next few decades by snapping up a smaller company with some key assets, investors and analysts say.""I think the vote will be positive for the deal,"" said Niels Lammerts van Bueren, portfolio manager at Dutch arbitrage fund TRZ Funds that trades shares in both companies. ""Indeed, with the cross-holdings very few holders will be voting against as that will cost them money.""Few investors and analysts have challenged the strategic sense of a merger that will make Shell the world's top liquefied natural gas (LNG) trader and a key player in Brazil's rapidly developing offshore oil production.But the 30 percent slump in oil prices to below $40 a barrel since the takeover was announced in April has left investors worrying about whether Shell will be able to maintain its dividend if the $54 billion takeover goes through. SHARES LAG Shell's acquisition of BG is largely based on the assumption that oil prices will rise over time to cover the relatively high costs of production in areas such as Australia and Brazil.The deal, which offered a 50 percent premium to BG's April 7 share price and was worth $70 billion then, includes a cash payment which Shell plans to cover by increasing its debt.Like its rivals, Shell slashed its 2015 spending by about 20 percent, cut thousands of jobs, delayed or scrapped huge projects and increased borrowing in the face of the oil price slump, but maintained its dividend payouts.The Anglo-Dutch company has announced further cost savings and job cuts for when the deal is completed, which it said would allow it to cope with a low oil price environment. Still, while investor concerns remain, and Shell shares have trailed in rivals including Exxon Mobil and BP in recent months, the chances of an investor revolt are slim, according to analysts and investors.To pass, a majority of voting BG shareholders, who also represent at least 75 percent of the outstanding shares, must approve the deal. For Shell, it requires a majority.""I still think there is good industrial logic for the two companies to be put together and the potential synergies may well be even more valuable in the current tough environment for oil companies,"" said Richard Marwood, senior investment manager at AXA Investment Managers, which owns Shell and BG stock. ""ALL GOOD"" Shell Chief Executive Officer Ben van Beurden and Chief Financial Officer Simon Henry have held numerous meetings this year with investors around the world to bolster support.""Shell have played their hand and need to close. The last thing they want is for BG to end up back on the market at a lower price that will lead to other suitors asking for a dance,"" said Robin Milway, Portfolio Manager, New Capital Global Equity Conviction Fund at EFG Asset Management, which owns both stocks.The takeover has more impetus following last week's climate deal in Paris as it is expected to boost demand for less polluting natural gas, said Richard Hulf, manager of Artemis Global Energy Fund, an investor in Shell and BG.""The other key part of the deal is phenomenal growth in Brazilian production. The timing is impeccable. Add to that the fall of Petrobras and you have even more of the world's best upstream assets falling into Shell's lap.""""It's all good,"" Hulf said.

595,"   By Karolin Schaps and Ron Bousso | LONDON  LONDON With crude prices at 11-year lows, the world's biggest oil and gas producers are facing their longest period of investment cuts in decades, but are expected to borrow more to preserve the dividends demanded by investors.At around $37 a barrel, crude prices are well below the $60 firms such as Total, Statoil and BP need to balance their books, a level that has already been sharply reduced over the past 18 months.International oil companies are once again being forced to cut spending, sell assets, shed jobs and delay projects as the oil slump shows no sign of recovery. U.S. producers Chevron and ConocoPhillips have published plans to slash their 2016 budgets by a quarter. Royal Dutch Shell has also announced a further $5 billion in spending cuts if its planned takeover of BG Group goes ahead.Global oil and gas investments are expected to fall to their lowest in six years in 2016 to $522 billion, following a 22 percent fall to $595 billion in 2015, according to the Oslo-based consultancy Rystad Energy.""This will be the first time since the 1986 oil price downturn that we see two consecutive years of a decline in investments,"" Bjoernar Tonhaugen, vice president of oil and gas markets at Rystad Energy, told Reuters.The activities that survive will be those that offer the best returns. But with the sector's debt to equity ratio at a relatively low level of around 20 percent or below, industry sources say companies will take on even more borrowing to cover the shortfall in revenue in order to protect the level of dividend payouts.Shell has not cut its dividend since 1945, a tradition its present management is not keen to break. The rest of the sector is also averse to reducing payouts to shareholders, which  include the world's biggest investment and pension funds, for fear investors might take flight.Exxon Mobil and Chevron benefit from the lowest debt ratios among the oil majors while Statoil and Repsol have the highest debt burden, according to Jefferies analyst Jason Gammel. FEW LARGE DECISIONS With only a handful of major projects approved in 2015, including Shell's Appomattox development in the Gulf of Mexico and Statoil's giant $29 billion Johan Sverdrup field in the North Sea, 2016 is also likely to see few large investment decisions.Projects that could be green-lit include BP's Mad Dog Phase 2 in the Gulf of Mexico, which the company now expects to cost less than $10 billion, around half the original estimate, and Chevron's expansion of the Tengiz project in Kazakhstan, according to Gammel.Industry-wide, costs will be cut by reducing the size of projects, renegotiating supply contracts and using less complex technology. After rapidly expanding in the first half of the decade when oil prices were above $100 a barrel, companies are now expected to focus on the most profitable activities, said Brendan Warn, oil and gas equity analyst at BMO Capital Markets.  ""Companies want to reduce their range of activity and pick those with the highest returns on capital,"" Warn said.Shell, which plans to complete its $54 billion acquisition of BG in February, intends to focus on the attractive liquefied natural gas (LNG) market and on deep water oil production, especially in Brazil, both areas in which BG is a leader.With similar priorities in mind, BP is increasingly focused on the Gulf of Mexico and Egypt, where it approved a $12 billion development in 2015.While tens of thousands of jobs have already been cut in 2015, more redundancies are expected this year as companies narrow their focus, Warn added.    On top of reducing spending by scrapping and delaying projects, oil majors will see costs come down as contractors agree to further price reductions. For example, the annual cost of hiring a drilling ship fell to an average of $332,000 in 2015, compared with $405,000 in 2014, according to Rigzone, which collects industry data.  The drop in investment bodes badly for services and contractor companies, which are seeing their work dry up.HOLD YOUR NERVE But with fewer projects approved, fewer fields developed and less maintenance work undertaken, companies are putting their growth at risk.""You've got to hold your nerve. If you cut too deeply, it is very, very difficult to take advantage of the price rebound when it comes,"" a senior official at a European oil major told Reuters.Tumbling oil prices have cut billions of dollars from oil companies' revenue streams, although strong profits from refining have softened the blow for most.And while their in-house oil and gas production growth comes under pressure, companies might opt to acquire rivals with less resilient balance sheets, as with Shell's proposed acquisition of BG.""In the second half of 2016, if we see price stabilisation, I expect companies will be looking to replace reserves inorganically, by making acquisitions,"" Warn said.

600,"  * Refiners tweak crude oil feedstocks to favour gasoline* Gasoline refining margins shine as diesel languishes* Strong demand for gasoline set to continue in 2016By Ron BoussoLONDON, Jan 12 After years of building up diesel production, European oil refiners are using every trick in the book to maximize gasoline output to meet unabated global demand as the two fuels stage a sharp reversal of fortune.Many operators on the continent, including Total, BP, Royal Dutch Shell and ExxonMobil, have invested hundreds of millions of dollars over the past decade to increase production of diesel, the road fuel of choice in the region, while seeking to lower gasoline output, seen as a mere ""by-product"" of that process until recently.But today the world faces a growing excess of diesel and spectacular demand in Asia and the United States for gasoline and naphtha, a feedstock for plastic manufacturing.While oil refineries can not maintain high output of gasoline without also ramping up diesel production, they are now taking every possible step to tweak production in order to favour gasoline and naphtha. One such step is using as feedstock lighter crude oil grades with higher yields of gasoline and naphtha. For example, light Nigerian crude prices have outperformed heavier gradesSome refineries have also opted to lower operating levels, or runs, in diesel producing units known as hydrocrackers.In recent weeks, as naphtha cracks surged to record levels, some refiners have tweaked the distillation boiling temperature, or ""cut point"", in order to favour naphtha over kerosene and jet fuel, according to refinery sources and traders.The results are already showing -- yields of middle distillates, which include gasoil and diesel, dropped to around 50 percent in December, date from industry monitor Euroilstock showed, the lowest in around 6 years. ""We expect European refiners to do all sorts of things... They are already doing this as the market is sending such strong signals. We will see fractions pulled out of the diesel pool and moved into jet and we will see naphtha fractions taken out of jet and moved into light ends,"" according to Robert Campbell, head of oil products research at consultancy Energy Aspects.Benchmark European gasoline refining margins, or cracks, rose to around $15 a barrel this week -- nearly three times higher than a year ago and ten times above 2013 levels -- as demand in China and Asia for the road fuel remains unabated.Diesel cracks, on the other hand, have languished due to rising global production, slower demand and a mild winter that has filled storage tanks to the brim. The small changes in refining slates are having an incremental effect. A 1 percent swing in yields could lower Europe's diesel production by more than 250,000 tonnes per month, according to Campbell.""It is not enough by itself to right the market but would help a little bit. A similar development in the U.S. Gulf Coast would shave another 150,000-200,000 tonnes off the balance and that starts to have a pretty significant effect on the overall number of cargoes being shown.""The global shortage in gasoline is expected to continue this year too.""With new refinery additions less tailored towards light products and increasing demand for petrol in Asia, it appears increasingly likely that the market could find itself short of gasoline again as it did over the summer of 2015,"" Barclays said in a note.In the near term, the sharp decline in crude oil prices due to a persistent supply glut is likely to support refining margins but Energy Aspect's Campbell expects ""modest"" cuts in refining rates in both Europe and the United States.Once crude supplies tighten towards the end of the year, ""that support will go away and margins will really struggle,"" he said.(Additional reporting by Libby George and Ahmad Ghaddar, editing by William Hardy)",2016-01-12,XOM,"Tue Jan 12, 2016 | 7:27am EST",Europe refiners rush to make more gasoline after diesel hangover,http://www.reuters.com//article/europe-refining-idUSL8N14W2GH20160112?type=companyNews
601,"   By Kristen Hays | HOUSTON  HOUSTON Jan 13 A U.S. safety agency said on Wednesday that a series of problems at Exxon Mobil Corp's  California refinery caused an explosion there nearly a year ago, as questions mounted about when the plant, which supplies 10 percent of the state's gasoline supply, would be fixed.An investigator for the U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board (CSB), Mark Wingard, said at an interim update of the board's probe that in February 2015 a series of leaks of steam and hydrocarbons led to the blast.Repairs are ongoing at the 149,500 barrels per day plant in Torrance, which provides 10 percent of California's gasoline supply.Exxon had hoped to restart shut units in February , but last week Macquarie Capital said in a note that the restart would likely be pushed into the second quarter because of setbacks in repairs. That could delay finalization of the plant's pending $537.5 million sale to PBF Energy Inc , Macquarie analyst Vikas Dwivedi said in the note.PBF announced in September it would buy the Torrance refinery, saying it would be restored to ""full working order"" prior to the deal's close in the second quarter of 2016. An Exxon spokesman said on Wednesday that the company expects to transfer control of the refinery to PBF Energy in mid-2016; he declined comment on a timeline for the repairs. A PBF spokesman did not respond to an inquiry.The explosion destroyed the pollution-controlling electrostatic precipitator (ESP) and damaged the plant's gasoline-making fluid catalytic cracking unit (FCCU), both of which have been shut since the blast. Wingard said hydrocarbons leaked into the main distillation column of the FCCU, then flowed back to a reactor, out a leaking valve to the ESP, where they found an ignition source.CSB Chairwoman Vanessa Allen Sutherland said on Wednesday that debris from the blast narrowly missed a tank containing hundreds of thousands of pounds of toxic hydroflouric acid, which can vaporize and spread for miles, burning eyes, skin and lungs.""This was a serious near-miss incident,"" she said. The California Division of Occupational Safety and Health in November lifted an order prohibiting Exxon from restarting the ESP and FCCU, saying they could restart when the ESP is repaired and installed.The blast injured two workers, but caused no deaths.(Reporting by Kristen Hays; Editing by Leslie Adler)",2016-01-13,XOM,"Wed Jan 13, 2016 | 2:58pm EST",Series of leaks caused blast at Exxon's Calif. refinery -investigator,http://www.reuters.com//article/refinery-operations-exxon-torrance-idUSL2N14X20220160113?type=companyNews

603,"  OSLO Jan 13 Energy major Statoil and its partners have agreed on a development concept for their Trestakk oil and gas discovery off the coast of Norway after cutting the cost of the project by several hundred million dollars, the company said on Wednesday.A final decision on whether or not to go ahead with the Norwegian Sea development will be taken during 2016, it added.Statoil, ENI and Exxon Mobil have picked a subsea concept that will reduce the investment cost by 30 percent compared to their initial estimate from March 2015, Statoil said in a statement.It did not reveal its cost estimate, but a Statoil spokesman said the savings amounted to several billion Norwegian crowns, corresponding to hundreds of millions of dollars. One dollar currently costs 8.86 Norwegian crowns.Development of Trestakk had previously been postponed to cut costs amid the crash in oil prices, which have forced energy firms to step up cash discipline and be cautious about investing in new projects. The field, discovered in 1986, will be developed with five subsea wells which will be tied in to the nearby Aasgard field, Statoil said. The oil ministry and the country's regulator have put pressure on Statoil to develop Trestakk, as the project is seen as time-critical due to its dependence of infrastructure in the area.Recoverable resources for the field were estimated at 75 million barrels of oil equivalents. Production upstart could take place in 2019, Statoil said.Operator Statoil holds a 59.1 percent stake in the project while Exxon Mobil has 33 percent and ENI 7.9 percent.

Because of efforts to reduce greenhouse gases and efficiency gains, Exxon sees energy-related carbon dioxide emissions peaking around 2030 before starting to decline, while emissions in developed countries are seen falling by about 20 percent from 2014 to 2040, it said.    ""The climate accord reached at the recent COP 21 conference in Paris set many new goals, and while many related policies are still emerging, the outlook continues to anticipate that such policies will increase the cost of carbon dioxide emissions over time,"" said William Colton, vice president of Exxon Mobil Corporate Strategic Planning.As policies evolve, the Irving, Texas company said it continues to assume that climate policies that increase the costs of emissions will reach an implied cost in developed nations of about $80 per tonne in 2040.

Wind and solar are expected to account for more than 10 percent of global electricity generation in 2040, up from 4 percent in 2014.Still, the company sees oil, natural gas and coal continuing  to meet almost 80 percent of the world’s energy needs through 2040.

611,"   By Kristen Hays | HOUSTON  HOUSTON Feb 1 Exxon Mobil Corp will soon start trucking crude from two California storage tanks because the company has no other means to empty them since the shutdown of an oil pipeline that ruptured last May and fouled Santa Barbara County shores.Santa Barbara County planners on Monday granted Exxon an emergency permit to fill trucks with crude from the tanks at its Los Flores Canyon facility and transport it to other pipelines.The permit said Plains All American Pipeline LP's  Line 901 is expected to be inoperable ""in excess of or at least six months"" this year, and Exxon needed another way to remove oil from the tanks for safety reasons. The tanks now hold a combined 425,000 barrels of crude when they usually contain a minimum of 50,000 barrels each when the Plains line operates normally. With Line 901 shut down since the breach last year, Exxon cannot otherwise empty the tanks. Leaving them full risks ""catastrophic failure"" of leaks if there are any fires, floods or earthquakes, the permit said.The permit will allow Exxon to load the stored oil into trucks, each able to hold about 150 barrels, and move most of it to a Plains pipeline hub in Kern County and another pipeline connected to Phillips 66's Santa Maria refinery in Arroyo Grande. It will take three to six weeks to empty the tanks with no more than 30 truck trips per day, the county said.Line 901 moved crude produced in Exxon's Santa Ynez offshore oilfield from Los Flores north along the California coastline to Gaviota.

612,"   By Anna Driver  Exxon Mobil Corp on Tuesday reported its smallest quarterly profit in more than a decade and said it will cut 2016 spending by one-quarter and suspend share repurchases as it copes with a prolonged downturn in crude prices.Shares of the world's largest publicly traded oil company fell as much as 3.6 percent on the New York Stock Exchange as the price of crude slid 4.2 percent. Crude oil prices have dropped about 70 percent from the 2014 high over $100 barrel. Current prices at around $30 barrel have triggered a wave of spending cuts as oil companies slash investment in new wells and projects to conserve cash.“We have built this business to ensure that it is durable in a low price environment,"" Jeff Woodbury, Exxon's head of investor relations, told analysts on a conference call.The results were somewhat buttressed from crude's downturn by its integrated business model and long-term investment horizon, unlike smaller shale companies. While profit plummeted in its exploration and production business, its refining unit earned more.  Exxon forecast capital spending at around $23.2 billion this year, a 25 percent drop from 2015.In another move to conserve cash, Exxon suspended its share buyback plan meant to return cash to investors in the first quarter, something it hasn't done in 15 years.Oil analyst Brian Youngberg at Edward Jones in St. Louis characterized Exxon's report as ""relatively good, especially when compared with BP's terrible results."" He noted that Exxon's oil and gas output was better than expected and that the company had improved its operations this year. Earlier Tuesday, BP Plc reported an annual loss of $6.5 billion, its largest ever. Smaller U.S. rival Chevron Corp last Friday also reported a net loss.    Irving, Texas-based Exxon reported that fourth-quarter profit tumbled to $2.78 billion, or 67 cents per share, from $6.57 billion, or $1.56 per share, in the same period a year earlier. The 2015 fourth-quarter profit was the smallest since September 2002. Analysts, on average, expected Exxon to earn 63 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Exxon said its oil and gas output rose 4.8 percent in the fourth quarter as it pumped more crude oil.While Exxon is scaling back on spending this year, Woodbury highlighted some recent offshore investments, including the acquisition of 652,000 net acres offshore Newfoundland.The stock was off 2.7 percent to $74.22 after falling as low as $73.55.

616,"   By Anna Driver  Exxon Mobil Corp on Tuesday reported its smallest quarterly profit in more than a decade and said it will cut 2016 spending by one-quarter and suspend share repurchases as it copes with a prolonged downturn in crude prices.Shares of the world's largest publicly traded oil company fell as much as 3.6 percent on the New York Stock Exchange as the price of crude slid 4.2 percent. Crude oil prices have dropped about 70 percent from the 2014 high over $100 barrel. Current prices at around $30 barrel have triggered a wave of spending cuts as oil companies slash investment in new wells and projects to conserve cash.“We have built this business to ensure that it is durable in a low price environment,"" Jeff Woodbury, Exxon's head of investor relations, told analysts on a conference call.The results were somewhat buttressed from crude's downturn by its integrated business model and long-term investment horizon, unlike smaller shale companies. While profit plummeted in its exploration and production business, its refining unit earned more.  Exxon forecast capital spending at around $23.2 billion this year, a 25 percent drop from 2015.In another move to conserve cash, Exxon suspended its share buyback plan meant to return cash to investors in the first quarter, something it hasn't done in 15 years.Oil analyst Brian Youngberg at Edward Jones in St. Louis characterized Exxon's report as ""relatively good, especially when compared with BP's terrible results."" He noted that Exxon's oil and gas output was better than expected and that the company had improved its operations this year. Earlier Tuesday, BP Plc reported an annual loss of $6.5 billion, its largest ever. Smaller U.S. rival Chevron Corp last Friday also reported a net loss.    Irving, Texas-based Exxon reported that fourth-quarter profit tumbled to $2.78 billion, or 67 cents per share, from $6.57 billion, or $1.56 per share, in the same period a year earlier. The 2015 fourth-quarter profit was the smallest since September 2002. Analysts, on average, expected Exxon to earn 63 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Exxon said its oil and gas output rose 4.8 percent in the fourth quarter as it pumped more crude oil.While Exxon is scaling back on spending this year, Woodbury highlighted some recent offshore investments, including the acquisition of 652,000 net acres offshore Newfoundland.The stock was off 2.7 percent to $74.22 after falling as low as $73.55.

618,"   By David Gaffen  Feb 2 Few phenomena in the stock market are more predictable than oil major Exxon Mobil Corp's massive share buyback program. Until now.The company, which has spent about $210 billion over the last decade buying back its own stock, is bowing to the reality that crude's sharp downturn is hurting its bottom line. It surprised investors on Tuesday by dramatically ratcheting back share repurchases, and for the first time in 15 years, Exxon Mobil will only buy back shares to offset dilution as opposed to return cash to shareholders.Exxon reported its smallest quarterly profit in more than a decade and said it will cut 2016 spending by one-quarter and suspend share repurchases.It is an unusual move as Exxon has spent more on share buybacks than any other company in the past 10 years, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices figures, and it's not even close. It far surpasses second-place Microsoft Corp, which has bought back $125 billion in that time. ""Exxon was the poster child for that and they haven't done so much of that lately,"" said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones.In 2015, the company bought back $4 billion in shares, which was the smallest amount it spent since 2000. Back then, Exxon spent $1.86 billion on repurchases, but it was a net issuer of shares in the first two quarters of that year. For the first quarter of 2016, the company could still be a net purchaser of shares, because stock grants to employees through benefit plans and options programs means it will need to buy back stock to offset dilution, the company said Tuesday.The move comes as its shares fall within 15 percent of a five-year low - when it would be more advantageous to repurchase its stock. Large companies have been criticized for excessive spending on buybacks to reduce share counts, which help boost earnings per share, rather than investing in capital expenditures or research.Exxon has long been known for cash distribution. It is one of the S&P's so-called ""dividend aristocrats,"" referring to companies that have increased their dividends every year for 25 consecutive years. For this past year, it spent more than $15 billion on dividends and buybacks.The company's buyback program peaked in 2008, when it repurchased nearly $35 billion in shares - a year when the stock price averaged $81.36 a share.The stock fell 2.7 percent to $74.25 on Tuesday.

Current prices at around $30 barrel have triggered a wave of spending cuts as oil companies slash investment in new wells and projects to conserve cash. Exxon sees capital spending at around $23.2 billion this year, a 25 percent drop from 2015.""While our financial results reflect the challenging environment, we remain focused on the business fundamentals, including project execution and effective cost management,"" Rex Tillerson, the chairman and chief executive officer, said in a statement. In another move to conserve cash, Exxon suspended its share buyback plan in the first quarter.

620,"  * European stocks drop 1.5 percent as BP, UBS add to oil woes* Crude futures extend overnight fall on oversupply fears* Dollar dips vs yen and euro, rises against EM currencies* Wall Street set to start lower, Exxon results dueBy Marc JonesLONDON, Feb 2 World stocks ended three days of gains on Tuesday as lacklustre global economic data led to another slump in oil prices.Oil fell 5 percent after dropping as much as 7 percent the previous session, and the glum macro mood left Wall Street set for 0.9 to 1.1 percent declines after losses in both Europe and Asia.Oil fell after BP announced its biggest loss in 20 years and plans to cut thousands of jobs, Exxon Mobil reported its profits plummeted and S&P cut the ratings of Shell and BHP Billiton.Stocks fell 1.2 to 2 percent in London, Frankfurt  and Paris as oil and gas shares dropped. Banks and Swiss stocks also took a bashing. UBS <UBS G.VX> slumped 8 percent after results showed its wealthy customers were pulling out their money in droves  .In the currency markets, waning risk appetite nudged Japan's yen and the euro higher against the dollar, although another safe haven, the Swiss franc,   dropped as its central bank said it would intervene to weaken the franc if necessary.Sterling reached a three-week high as European Council President Donald Tusk presented proposals for keeping Britain in the European Union. UK Prime Minister David Cameron said the plans showed ""real progress"" although there was ""more work to do"".""I don't think the market has much of a clue on what to focus on,"" said John Hardy head of FX strategy. ""It doesn't seem too convinced with the narrative of hooray for central bank liquidity again, and the oil price going down and whole reserve destruction theme is bad for risk appetite."" The lure of relative safety saw gains for benchmark U.S. and European government bonds. Euro zone yields got an extra kick lower from European Central Bank President Mario Draghi's reiteration on Monday that the ECB may cut rates again next month.Oil still dominated the moves, though. Brent and U.S. crude   fell $32.98 and $30.65 a barrel respectively, having lost as much as 7 percent overnight.Oil fell amid weak economic data from China, Europe and the United States and doubts that oil-producing countries will cut output in the face of a global supply glut. Oil production in Russia rose to a post-Soviet high in January,  the latest data from its energy ministry showed.""It's hard to see a successful agreement between OPEC and Russia to cut production, and people are starting to see that,"" said Andy Sommer, senior energy analyst at Axpo Trading in Dietikon, Switzerland. EMERGING PRESSURES In the United States, oil giant Exxon Mobil was the top draw after BP's woes. It is the world's largest publicly traded oil company, and said it would slash capital spending by a quarter after its profit halved in the fourth quarter.Markets appeared little fazed by the results of Iowa's caucus for the U.S. presidential nomination. Among Republicans, U.S. Senator Ted Cruz beat Donald Trump. For the Democrats, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was in a virtual tie with rival Bernie Sanders.The dollar climbed as much as 1 percent the rouble, the rand, Mexico's peso and Malaysia's ringgit . Emerging market stocks fell 1.5 percent after four days of gains.Overnight, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan had lost 1.2 percent. Stocks fell almost everywhere except China, which saw a 2 percent bounce.Tokyo's Nikkei ended down 0.6 percent after two days of gains following the Bank of Japan's move to negative interest rates late last week. The Australian dollar also slipped after the country's central bank kept rates unchanged  but left the door open to further easing.

Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N), which owns 69.6 percent of Imperial, also reported a 58 percent drop in quarterly profit on Tuesday.Imperial said gross production averaged 400,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up from 315,000 a year earlier.

TonenGeneral, formerly a unit of Exxon Mobil, bought a controlling stake in itself from Exxon in 2012 in a roughly $4 billion deal, reducing Exxon's stake from 50 percent to 22 percent as the oil major pulls back due to declining Japanese oil demand. Exxon Mobil had gradually reduced its stake in TonenGeneral since then, and had been replaced by Mitsui & Co as the top shareholder in the refiner with a 6.37 percent stake. TonenGeneral also said on Friday it planned to set up a U.S. office in Houston on March 1, making it the company's fifth overseas base.

627,"   By Jacob Gronholt-Pedersen  A liquefied natural gas (LNG) tanker on Sunday docked at the Sabine Pass terminal in Louisiana, with only days to go before the United States ships its first export cargo of seaborne gas from the lower 48 states.U.S. exports will add to a wave of supply coming from Australian projects at a time when demand is faltering in major consuming countries and prices plummeting in line with oil.Expected to become an importer of LNG just a decade ago, the shale gas revolution in the United States that unlocked cheap, abundant supplies has wreaked havoc on global gas markets as LNG meant for the country was redirected around the world.Set to load the first shale gas to export markets, the Asia Vision LNG tanker docked at Cheniere Energy's Sabine Pass LNG terminal on Sunday, Reuters ship tracking data showed. The tanker arrived in January in the Gulf of Mexico, but has been anchored off the coast of the terminal after the first shipment from the facility was delayed due to mechanical problems.Another tanker, the Energy Atlantic, has also been waiting in the Gulf of Mexico to pick up LNG from Sabine Pass since January.Cheniere said it expected its first cargo to leave the facility by the end of this month or in early March. ""We will export the first cargo shortly. Touch wood, it'll be at the end of February or in early March,"" Andrew Walker, Cheniere Energy's vice president for strategy, said during an energy industry event in Germany last week. The company initially intended Sabine Pass as an LNG import terminal but will draw on shale gas production for exports instead.AUSTRALIA RAMPS UP EXPORTS First exports from Sabine Pass comes within days of the world's most expensive LNG plant - the $54 billion Gorgon project in Australia - shipping its first cargo. ""The timing is incredible,"" said Bernstein analyst Neil Beveridge.Companies including Chevron Corp, Royal Dutch Shell and Exxon Mobil Corp have invested some $180 billion in seven Australian LNG export plants ramping up production from 2015 to 2017, making the country the top exporter of the fuel ahead of Qatar.""Sabine Pass will just add to the global oversupply,"" said Beveridge, although he expects the facility to run below capacity for the time being because of weak demand and low prices.Four other U.S. projects have already broken ground, including Dominion Resources' Cove Point plant in Maryland expected in 2017, Sempra Energy's Cameron LNG in Louisiana and Freeport LNG's plant in Texas expected in 2018, and Cheniere's Corpus Christi plant in Texas in 2019. Once operational, Sabine Pass will be the first LNG export terminal outside of Alaska. The United States has been exporting LNG mostly to Japan from Alaska since 1969.With growth in pipeline exports to Mexico and LNG exports to the world, the United States is expected to transition from a net importer of gas, mostly from Canada, to a net exporter by 2017 as the nation's shale gas production continues to grow, according to federal energy forecasts.The United States was last a net exporter of gas in 1957.In 2015, the U.S. exported on average 0.07 billion cubic feet per day from Alaska, according to federal data. That is expected to rise to 0.5 bcfd in 2016 and 1.33 bcfd in 2017 with the startup of the liquefaction units at Sabine Pass and other LNG facilities, according to federal forecasts.For comparison, the United States produces about 80 bcfd of gas, according to federal data.

That does not go far enough for New York State, the Church of England and other shareholders who own Exxon shares worth more than $1 billion.

630,"   By Michael Erman and Jarrett Renshaw | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) said on Wednesday it would continue to cut spending as long as crude prices remain low, but the world's largest publicly traded oil company added it may look at potential acquisitions in a bid to offset a dip in production.Exxon, which has a triple-A credit rating, raised $12 billion in the debt market earlier this week, leading analysts to speculate the oil major may be gearing up for an acquisition spree.The company said it has the financial flexibility to boost  spending if the right opportunities present themselves. But Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson, speaking at an analyst meeting in New York, said the company was more likely to purchase stand-alone assets than whole companies. He said he believed many companies have damaged their value by raising debt or issuing equity to deal with low oil prices.""There's been a fair amount of value destruction in the last year,"" Tillerson said. ""It's like buying a home with a big mortgage on it. There's not a lot of equity left there."" Texas-based Exxon said it expects its capital spending, which has been falling since hitting a peak of $42.5 billion in 2013, to drop next year from the $23.2 billion it now plans to spend this year. It spent $31.1 billion in 2015.Early last year, Exxon said its average annual spending would be around $34 billion over the next several years. The company also said on Wednesday that it was on track to start up 10 new oil and gas projects through the end of next year, which would add 450,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boed) to its production capacity.But it expects long-term production of between 4.0 million and 4.2 million boed through 2020, compared to 4.25 million boed in the last quarter of 2015.

631,"   By Michael Erman and Jarrett Renshaw | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) said on Wednesday it would continue to cut spending as long as crude prices remain low, but the world's largest publicly traded oil company added it may look at potential acquisitions in a bid to offset a dip in production.Exxon, which has a triple-A credit rating, raised $12 billion in the debt market earlier this week, leading analysts to speculate the oil major may be gearing up for an acquisition spree.The company said it has the financial flexibility to boost  spending if the right opportunities present themselves. But Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson, speaking at an analyst meeting in New York, said the company was more likely to purchase stand-alone assets than whole companies. He said he believed many companies have damaged their value by raising debt or issuing equity to deal with low oil prices.""There's been a fair amount of value destruction in the last year,"" Tillerson said. ""It's like buying a home with a big mortgage on it. There's not a lot of equity left there.""

632,"   By Hillary Flynn  NEW YORK, March 2 (IFR) - Long dated bonds are the hottest products in the investment grade corporate bond market right now - a reversal since the start of the year when many nervous investors were balking at anything but short-dated bonds.While some big names borrowers tapped long-term money earlier in the year, 10 and 30-year tranches have become more commonplace of late as risk aversion fades and investors hunt for yield.""People have just given up the ghost of buying the safest of the safe, and (long-dated corporates) is just where there's some value, and people can pick up some yield,"" said Craig Elder, senior fixed-income analyst at asset management firm Baird.Of the US$244.624bn of high-grade supply seen year to March 1, US$38.55bn has been raised through paper with maturities of 30 years or more, according to IFR data.Tranches with maturities of 10 to 12 years represent US$78.75bn in supply over that period, while tenors of less than 10-years garnered US$127.33bn.The US$7.5bn Johnson & Johnson deal last Thursday shined the spotlight on this newly sought-after area of the curve when its 10, 20 and 30-year tranches enjoyed the largest demand.This week the bid for duration remained strong as oil major Exxon Mobil, utilities Public Service Electric & Gas and Indiana Michigan Power, as well as insurance company Manulife all raised 30-year money.An increasing number of borrowers also opted for 10-year paper this week, including Hyatt Hotels, HSBC Holdings and O'Reilly Automotive. Perhaps more notable than the rising volume of long-term bonds was the demand for them.Books on Johnson & Johnson's long-dated securities swelled to anywhere between US$6.4bn and US$7.4bn, while shorter tranches saw interest peak at around US$3bn.It was a similar story for Exxon Mobil, which boasted $11bn and US$9.1bn books sizes on its 30 and 10-year tranches which both had sizes of US$2.5bn. The sub 10-year tranches meanwhile enjoyed demand of between US$1bn to US$6.3bn. DESPERATE FOR YIELD This renewed bid for longer-dated paper has largely been driven by one thing: yield.""Demand at the 10-year (and out) is natural from people desperate for yield,"" said George Schultze, CEO at Schultze Asset Management.Investors' hunger for yield has grown alongside a rally in Treasuries this year. Concerns about global growth have pressured yields in the US lower while also forcing rates in Japan and Europe into negative territory.And while US Treasury yields were rising on Wednesday after better-than-expected economic data drove markets to change their views on the pace of US rate hikes this year, rates still remain low worldwide.The 10-year Treasury's yield was at 1.86% on Wednesday. That is up from the recent low of 1.68% seen on February 25, but still considerably lower than the 2.25% of January 4, or the 2.49% seen on June 22.Against that backdrop, corporate bonds, especially longer-dated issues, look attractive.""Inflation is moving higher than people expected so Treasury yields are too low, and spreads have now widened out in corporate bonds so you're getting more yield,"" Elder said.The spread for the average high-grade corporate bond has widened by 38bp to 205bp over Treasuries as of February 29, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch data.Concessions on primary deals are also enticing enough for investors who have difficulty sourcing bonds in size in the secondary markets.""What's driving a lot of the demand is pretty healthy concessions relative to secondary trading,"" said Mark Heppenstall, CIO of Penn Mutual Asset Management. ""Liquidity challenges are making trading a ton of secondary paper more difficult.""

637,"  HOUSTON California's worker safety agency issued citations to Exxon Mobil Corp's refining subsidiary on Friday for failure to repair faulty equipment at its Torrance, California, refinery, exposing workers to risk of injury or death, Cal/OSHA said.The three citations stem from Exxon's failure to repair a three-inch nozzle that caused a leak of hydrofluoric acid used in the alkylation unit on Sept. 6, 2015, the agency said.  An Exxon spokesman said the company was working with Cal/OSHA to resolve the citations.""We continue to work cooperatively with Cal/OSHA to understand the findings of their investigation and the basis for their citations,"" said Exxon spokesman Todd Spitler. ""Providing a safe working environment that protects our employees, contractors, and the community in which we operate will always be our first priority.""  The nozzle was cause of a leak in 2011 and Exxon repaired it with a clamp, which remained on the equipment until the company replaced the nozzle 48 hours after the 2015 leak. If the citations are not modified or withdrawn, Exxon, one of the world's largest corporations, could be required to pay fines totaling $72,120. Exxon was allowed to resume the operation of the alkylation unit in January following a Cal/OSHA inspection.The citations are not related to an explosion on the gasoline-producing fluidic catalytic cracking unit at the refinery in February 2015. Exxon announced in September it would sell the Torrance refinery to PBF Energy Inc for $537.2 million.

639,"   By Howard Schneider | BAYTOWN, Texas  BAYTOWN, Texas Plunging energy prices robbed the Texas economy of an estimated 60,000 jobs last year, as oil and gas companies put the brakes on production and slashed investment, throwing engineers and geologists out of work. But the forest of construction cranes sprouting around this petrochemical hub tell the flip side of the story, as some of the same forces that drove down those prices sparked tens of billions of dollars in investment in new processing plants to take advantage of cheap and plentiful supplies of oil and gas.Exxon Mobil Corp and Chevron Phillips Chemical Co, a joint venture of Chevron Corp and Phillips 66, are building mammoth chemical crackers to process polyethylene from natural gas, and logistics firms have created millions of new square feet of warehouse space as they plan to ship the output to the global plastics industry. Rising chemicals output has contributed to record traffic at the Houston Port Authority, and officials say the trend is expected to continue. Throughout the Baytown area, which is on the outskirts of Houston, an estimated $8 billion worth of projects is expected to be finished this year and another $22 billion completed in 2017.This has all propped up employment in Texas at an otherwise difficult time. The positive impact on the overall U.S. economy from the chemicals industry that this illustrates is also one of the reasons the U.S. should avoid a downturn despite troubles elsewhere in the world. That in turn should create the conditions for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates again this year. ""They are shedding jobs upstream. That's the nature of the business,"" said B.J. Simon, associate executive director of the Baytown-West Chambers County Economic Development Foundation. But ""the opportunity to build these crackers just could not be passed up...access to cheap feedstocks changed the whole equation downstream.""Construction workers have jobs, new schools are being built to handle a growing local population, a new Kroger Marketplace  store is being completed, and a partially vacant shopping mall is being overhauled. JOBS: THE FED'S NORTH STAR The global economy may be sputtering, with weak demand one of the reasons that oil prices have cratered. But the U.S. keeps adding jobs, and at a rate consistent with the outlook from Fed policymakers who expect growing U.S. payrolls will mean enough domestic spending to keep the economy expanding overall.Texas ""lost a lot of energy jobs,"" said Dallas Fed research head Mine Yucel, but the state ""has been very resilient. I was surprised."" Across the oil patch, there's a similar pattern of positive trends offsetting bad news. Though low prices have crippled investment in exploration and cut drilling rigs, overall employment in Oklahoma continues to rise in a state that has built large logistics and defense contracting industries.In North Dakota, ground zero for the fracking boom, overall employment has dropped, but the unemployment rate remains a super-low 2.7 percent compared to the national average of 4.9 percent. The number is held down by an expected adjustment: just as workers flocked to the state when vacancies were plentiful, the labor force has declined as the jobs disappeared and workers returned home. These states represent a drop in the bucket compared to Texas's $1.6 trillion, 12.5 million-job economy, a size approaching that of Canada. Despite the oil downturn, the unemployment rate is only 4.7 percent as non-energy companies like fiber-optic manufacturer Applied Optoelectronics expand in the state. In a rough year for the oil business, the state as a whole added 144,000 jobs in 2015, according to the Texas Workforce Commission, with strong gains across the trade and hospitality sectors, as well as professional services, health and education.ROCKY START The Fed meets next week to take stock of the U.S. economy after a rocky beginning to the year. A rate hike is not expected at the March meeting but the central bank’s post-meeting statement and fresh economic projections from policymakers will provide important insight into how worried the Fed is about the combined impact of cheap oil and weak global demand on prospects for U.S. jobs, growth and investment. In an organization that prizes consensus under Chair Janet Yellen, clear cracks have emerged: between Vice Chair Stanley Fischer's recent statement that inflation is ""stirring,"" for example, and Fed Governor Lael Brainard's continued caution about how the rest of the world may inhibit the U.S. The Fed raised rates in December for the first time in a decade and projections by its policymakers at the time showed they expected four hikes this year. However, many investors and analysts now feel the Fed may be stuck where it is for much of the rest of the year. The jobs growth figures provide a counterweight to that view. The labor recovery has been going on for seven years now, and whenever hiring has slowed in one sector of the economy another has picked up the slack.The early strength in commodity-based jobs that spread across the fracking fields of North Dakota and Oklahoma gave way over the past two years to a surge in construction, education and health-related positions. Even in government, where belt-tightening by local, state and federal agencies trimmed payrolls coming out of the recession, employment is growing again. U.S. non-farm jobs growth has held at an average of 190,000 per month during the recovery. That's faster than anticipated and strong enough to both accommodate new entrants to the labor force and bring sidelined workers back into jobs.There have been concerns that many of the jobs being created were at the low end of the wage spectrum, in restaurants, hotels and retail stores. But more recent analysis of occupation and wage trends by Goldman Sachs showed that over the past two years in particular job gains have been strongest in higher-paying positions. For a graph showing the composition of U.S. jobs growth in the past few years, see tmsnrt.rs/1pvEZyo In its most recent Beige Book release of anecdotal economic information, Fed officials noted that former oilfield workers were shifting into jobs as auto mechanics, while construction and petrochemical companies had shortages in fields considered complementary to the skills of frontline oil and gas workers.""It's easier to place a welder right now than someone with a four-year degree,"" said Jim Hanna, a vice president for human resources and industrial relations with Fluor, the engineering and construction giant working on the Chevron Phillips Chemical project in Baytown. Fluor's workforce at that site is already up to 3,000, with 600 more to be hired over the summer.FEWER BMWS In the Houston metropolitan area, which compared to the rest of Texas has traditionally been most dependent on the energy sector, the oil crash did not prevent a net gain of 23,000 jobs last year. That was well short of the above-average 100,000 positions that the city had been adding in recent years as oil production surged, said Patrick Jankowski, vice president of research at the Greater Houston Partnership. But it is also more in line with the city's long-run average and likely more sustainable. While there may be some impact on wages from the loss of higher paying positions for geologists and engineers, said Jankowski, some of the skilled construction trade and health jobs that will replace them also pay above average.Fluor's Hanna said it was typical for construction workers to put in 50-hour weeks or more, with annual wages running upwards of $100,000.""I would not describe Houston's economy as strong, but I would never use the word recession,"" Jankowski said.

644,"   By Tim McLaughlin and Luc Cohen | OKLAHOMA CITY  OKLAHOMA CITY Nearly 15 years since Enron’s collapse decimated the retirement accounts of its employees, hundreds of thousands of U.S. energy workers remain precariously exposed to big, concentrated bets on company stock in their 401(k) retirement plans.The slide in oil prices to their lowest levels in over a decade wiped out several billion dollars of retirement wealth in the energy sector in the past year. The losses may prove temporary for companies that successfully navigate the crisis, but tens of thousands of employees of struggling firms may see much of their nest eggs gone for good.In Oklahoma and Texas, workers are delaying retirement plans, surrendering trucks, cars and land in personal bankruptcy cases, or just praying oil prices will recover.""I just didn't see it coming,"" said John Thompson, 57, who was laid off in February from Oklahoma City-based SandRidge Energy Inc SDOC.PK. SandRidge shares, which peaked above $65 in 2008, are now worth 10 cents apiece. ""Because of this, I'm not retiring any time soon.""SandRidge did not return messages seeking comment.Almost without exception energy company 401(k) plans offered at least 10 different investment alternatives to company stock, their plans show.Yet company reports and interviews with more than 20 current and former employees at independent energy firms show many employees have not taken advantage of opportunities to switch out of company shares. Maureen Nelson, who retired from Chesapeake Energy Corp (CHK.N) in 2013, said she lost an estimated $100,000 as she watched the company's shares plunge in value.Inertia and a strong faith in company leadership played a role in holding on to company stock, but so did company policies.Many energy firms continued to match employee contributions with company stock, even as most large U.S. companies stopped the practice after the Enron debacle, according to several corporate benefits consultants.The energy industry followed the lead of heavyweights such as Chevron Corp (CVX.N) and Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N), which for years provided matching contributions in company stock in worker 401(k) retirement plans while also funding separate defined benefit pension plans for them.DOUBLE IMPACT Smaller companies could not afford to do both, but they typically matched employee contributions in stock. And energy workers often plowed some or most of their own contributions into company stock, benefits consultants said.  ""It's not prudent investing,"" said Lou Harvey, chief executive of Boston-based financial research firm Dalbar Inc. “But employees tend to clamor for company stock.”Typically, workers at larger energy companies would have 20 percent to 60 percent of 401(k) assets in company stock, according to a Reuters analysis of such holdings for more than 400,000 employees.By contrast, the average U.S. 401(k) plan has about 7 percent of assets in company stock, according to Washington D.C.-based Investment Company Institute.At Chevron, more than 40,000 participants in its 401(k) plan held $8.9 billion, or 47 percent of investment assets, in company stock at the end of 2014, according to the latest annual report. (Graphic:tmsnrt.rs/1RwkqYB)Chevron stopped matching in company stock last year for better diversification, spokeswoman Melissa Ritchie said. Exxon stopped new stock contributions after 2006. Its shares still accounted for $12.9 billion of the 401(k) plan's $22.3 billion in assets in 2014. Exxon declined comment.When Texas-based Enron filed for bankruptcy in 2001, employees suffered a one-two punch - they lost their jobs and much of their savings because nearly two-thirds of their retirement assets were in Enron stock.After Enron's collapse, companies successfully lobbied Congress mostly against proposals to limit company stock ownership in 401(k) plans, fearing billions of dollars of their shares would be offloaded to meet the caps. “Caps were a bridge too far for companies,” said Sheila Bair, former chair of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and a U.S. Treasury official who worked on President George W. Bush’s 2002 task force on retirement security.Still, publicly-traded companies have revamped their retirement plans to make them more balanced, even imposing own limits on company stock ownership, said Rob Austin, director of retirement research at Aon Hewitt.FOLLOW THE LEADER Diversification has yet to reach much of the energy sector, though. Oil and gas workers had more than $32 billion in company stock in their 401(k) accounts, or about 38 percent of plan assets for the 40 companies in the S&P 500 Energy Sector Index, according to 2014 annual reports filed with the U.S. Department of Labor. Since then, the index has lost 21 percent.

650,"   By Tim McLaughlin and Luc Cohen | OKLAHOMA CITY  OKLAHOMA CITY Nearly 15 years since Enron’s collapse decimated the retirement accounts of its employees, hundreds of thousands of U.S. energy workers remain precariously exposed to big, concentrated bets on company stock in their 401(k) retirement plans.The slide in oil prices to their lowest levels in over a decade wiped out several billion dollars of retirement wealth in the energy sector in the past year. The losses may prove temporary for companies that successfully navigate the crisis, but tens of thousands of employees of struggling firms may see much of their nest eggs gone for good.In Oklahoma and Texas, workers are delaying retirement plans, surrendering trucks, cars and land in personal bankruptcy cases, or just praying oil prices will recover.""I just didn't see it coming,"" said John Thompson, 57, who was laid off in February from Oklahoma City-based SandRidge Energy Inc SDOC.PK. SandRidge shares, which peaked above $65 in 2008, are now worth 10 cents apiece. ""Because of this, I'm not retiring any time soon.""SandRidge did not return messages seeking comment.Almost without exception energy company 401(k) plans offered at least 10 different investment alternatives to company stock, their plans show.Yet company reports and interviews with more than 20 current and former employees at independent energy firms show many employees have not taken advantage of opportunities to switch out of company shares. Maureen Nelson, who retired from Chesapeake Energy Corp (CHK.N) in 2013, said she lost an estimated $100,000 as she watched the company's shares plunge in value.Inertia and a strong faith in company leadership played a role in holding on to company stock, but so did company policies.Many energy firms continued to match employee contributions with company stock, even as most large U.S. companies stopped the practice after the Enron debacle, according to several corporate benefits consultants.The energy industry followed the lead of heavyweights such as Chevron Corp (CVX.N) and Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N), which for years provided matching contributions in company stock in worker 401(k) retirement plans while also funding separate defined benefit pension plans for them.DOUBLE IMPACT Smaller companies could not afford to do both, but they typically matched employee contributions in stock. And energy workers often plowed some or most of their own contributions into company stock, benefits consultants said.  ""It's not prudent investing,"" said Lou Harvey, chief executive of Boston-based financial research firm Dalbar Inc. “But employees tend to clamor for company stock.”Typically, workers at larger energy companies would have 20 percent to 60 percent of 401(k) assets in company stock, according to a Reuters analysis of such holdings for more than 400,000 employees.By contrast, the average U.S. 401(k) plan has about 7 percent of assets in company stock, according to Washington D.C.-based Investment Company Institute.At Chevron, more than 40,000 participants in its 401(k) plan held $8.9 billion, or 47 percent of investment assets, in company stock at the end of 2014, according to the latest annual report. (Graphic:tmsnrt.rs/1RwkqYB)Chevron stopped matching in company stock last year for better diversification, spokeswoman Melissa Ritchie said. Exxon stopped new stock contributions after 2006. Its shares still accounted for $12.9 billion of the 401(k) plan's $22.3 billion in assets in 2014. Exxon declined comment.When Texas-based Enron filed for bankruptcy in 2001, employees suffered a one-two punch - they lost their jobs and much of their savings because nearly two-thirds of their retirement assets were in Enron stock.After Enron's collapse, companies successfully lobbied Congress mostly against proposals to limit company stock ownership in 401(k) plans, fearing billions of dollars of their shares would be offloaded to meet the caps. “Caps were a bridge too far for companies,” said Sheila Bair, former chair of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and a U.S. Treasury official who worked on President George W. Bush’s 2002 task force on retirement security.Still, publicly-traded companies have revamped their retirement plans to make them more balanced, even imposing own limits on company stock ownership, said Rob Austin, director of retirement research at Aon Hewitt.FOLLOW THE LEADER Diversification has yet to reach much of the energy sector, though. Oil and gas workers had more than $32 billion in company stock in their 401(k) accounts, or about 38 percent of plan assets for the 40 companies in the S&P 500 Energy Sector Index, according to 2014 annual reports filed with the U.S. Department of Labor. Since then, the index has lost 21 percent. Smaller independents have been hit about twice as hard, on average.With about a third of his 401(k) plan in company stock, retired Chesapeake geologist Keith Rasmussen, 61, looks to sell land he owns in Oklahoma and Idaho to shore up his depleted retirement funds. Chesapeake, once a shale boom darling, now trades 84 percent below mid-2014 levels, hurt by heavy debt and prolonged slump in natural gas prices. Nearly 8,000 participants in its 401(k) are exposed to the reversal of fortune, holding 35 percent of the plan’s $615 million in assets in company stock at the end of 2014, according to the latest annual report. Some current and former Chesapeake employees said their decisions to hold onto stock were based partly on their reverence for Aubrey McClendon, its legendary former chief executive, who died in a car crash in early March ""You could be the biggest skeptic in the world, and you listen to him in a room for 30 minutes, and you're ready to hand him all your money,"" said Ginni Kennedy, 58, who retired from her engineering job at Chesapeake in 2013.

655,"  (Refile to fix formatting)MILAN/LONDON, March 25 Exxon Mobil is in talks to buy a stake of around 15 percent in Italian oil major Eni's giant Area 4 gas field in Mozambique, two sources familiar with the matter said.Exxon is seen as a front-runner to buy into Eni's gas development and this would be the U.S. firm's first big acquisition since the oil price collapse.Area 4, in which Eni holds a 50 percent operating stake, is located in Mozambique's Rovuma Basin, where gas in place amounts to some 85 trillion cubic feet -- one of the richest gas discoveries of recent times.It will feed a series of onshore LNG export plants, mainly supplying Asian markets.ENI said previously it aimed to sell around 15 percent of the field. Two sources said Exxon was in talks to buy a stake of that size, one of whom said Eni was also negotiating with other firms. ""I am upbeat a deal will be reached fairly soon,"" the second source said.A banking source familiar with the matter said Exxon was interested in buying Eni's whole 50 percent stake, while a fourth source said Exxon was looking at unspecified stakes in all Eni holdings up for sale, also including assets in Egypt and elsewhere in Africa. Exxon and Eni declined to comment.Eni, a front-runner among the majors in finding reserves,  said earlier this month it would sell 7 billion euros of assets to 2019, most from farming down prize acreage. But it aims to hang on to operatorship of the fields.""The disposals will be mainly through the dilution of our stakes in recent and material discoveries,"" CEO Claudio Descalzi said earlier this month, picking out Mozambique and Egypt as prime candidates. Descalzi said the group was not far from disposal in Mozambique, where it was holding talks with ""a lot of interested parties"".Sales talks have got bogged down in recent years after crashing oil and gas prices drove a wedge between buyers' and sellers' price expectations, industry sources have said.Eni has been in talks with several buyers including China's Huadian Corp, sources have said.The huge productive capacity of Eni's Mozambique acreage attracted peak valuations two years ago, when Eni sold 20 percent to China's CNPC for $4.2 billion, amid strong competition for reserves.

660,"  (Adds minister and Rosneft comments)MOSCOW, March 29 Rosneft is set to lower oil output, Russian Natural Resources Minister Sergei Donskoi said on Tuesday, ahead of a meeting of leading global oil producers in Doha on April 17 to discuss an output freeze to support weak oil prices.Russia, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Venezuela are keen to prop up falling oil prices, which have fallen almost two thirds from a peak in June 2014. These countries have said they are ready to freeze production at January levels if other producers do the same.Qatar has invited all OPEC members and other major producers to attend the Doha talks next month on a deal to freeze output. Asked to comment on how a global oil production freeze would impact Russia, Donskoi said Russia's energy firms had adjusted their production plans: ""Rosneft, as it told (us), is planning to lower (output)"".Rosneft declined to comment. Rosneft, Russia's biggest oil producer, has been producing at the pace of around 3.8 million barrels per day (bpd), more than a third of Russia's total 10.88 million bpd, one of the world's highest. Earlier this month, industry sources told Reuters that the company floated the idea of a domestic production cut to balance the global market and as it faces a natural decline this year.Donskoi said Lukoil, which is not state-owned, did not plan to decrease production as yet. The minister also said he hoped that state-controlled Rosneft would resume drilling for oil in the Arctic next year after having no plans to do that this year.Rosneft suspended Arctic drilling in 2014 after its partner ExxonMobil withdrew from the Kara Sea project because of Western sanctions imposed on Moscow over its role in the conflict in eastern Ukraine.

662,"  (Repeats with no changes to text)By Clyde RussellLAUNCESTON, Australia, March 29 - The falling dominoes that are major liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects show that the industry needs a re-think on how it is structured and operates.Up until now LNG has largely been about massive and costly projects undertaken by international majors on the basis that the billions of dollars being invested is guaranteed to make a good return because of long-term sales contracts to utilities.But the scrapping of Woodside Petroleum's Browse floating LNG project off the coast of Western Australian state goes a long way to confirm that the model that has so far underpinned the development of the industry is no longer viable.Woodside, which operates Australia's giant Northwest Shelf project as well as its own Pluto facility, is no newcomer to LNG, and it's telling that it couldn't envisage a way to make the $30-billion Browse project profitable in the current environment.Woodside's partner in Browse, energy major Royal Dutch Shell , had previously flagged that the project would only work if it could be profitable at an oil price of less $50 a barrel. Given Brent crude is currently around $40, it seems the price hurdle was probably too great for Browse.But so was the lack of customers keen to sign up to long-term, oil-linked contracts, something acknowledged by Woodside Chief Executive Peter Coleman.Asian buyers now hold the whip hand in LNG pricing, given the rapid growth in supply from new projects in Australia, five of which have started in the past two years and three more planned to start by 2017.In addition, the United States has exported its first LNG through the Sabine Pass facility and has four more projects currently under construction.The problem is that all these new projects have altered the supply-demand balance to the point where it's hard to see the market being able to absorb all the available LNG, even if prices continue to slump. Asian spot LNG LNG-AS was at $4.50 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) last week, close to the record low of $4.30 reached earlier this month and less than a quarter of the peak of $20.50 reached in February 2014.It's not only the new supply that has driven prices lower, demand has been softer than expected, with Japan's imports dropping for a sixth consecutive month in February, in what may well be confirmation of a structural decline in the world's biggest buyer of the super-cooled fuel.China, the big hope for LNG demand growth, has imported 14.3 percent more in the first two months of 2016 than it did for the same period last year, but it's worth noting that imports actually fell 1 percent last year.The spike in LNG purchases so far this year is most likely related to increased use of natural gas for heating, and this may not be sustained as winter comes to an end.However, overall China should still be a growth story for natural gas, given the authorities' determination to rely less on polluting coal. There is also the potential for greater LNG imports across Southeast Asia, with more countries planning to use the fuel, including Bangladesh, Myanmar, Vietnam and the Philippines.Traditional exporters Indonesia and Malaysia may well end up as net importers as well, given the depletion of their domestic natural gas fields and rising demand at home.But even if demand can rise to meet existing and under construction supply, this doesn't necessarily support the development of a raft of proposed projects.DOWNSTREAM KEY TO FUTURE PROJECTS  There are proposals for new ventures in Australia, Canada, the United States, Russia and Mozambique, to name just a few.While some of these aim to be floating LNG platforms and some more conventional onshore plants, one thing they all have in common is that they will cost billions of dollars each.It's very hard to see multi-billion dollar projects moving to final investment decisions if long-term customers aren't signed up.What this means is that if any of these planned ventures are to see the light of day, their proponents will have to do more than build them in the hope that buyers will come.The industry needs to consider going downstream in order to ensure its long-term viability.Much like oil companies' move from producing oil into refining it and then retailing fuels, so too will LNG companies have to find ways to establish a sustainable market that will create and maintain demand for their product.This means investing in re-gasification terminals in developing nations, along with associated pipeline infrastructure and storages.It may also mean building gas-fired power plants, transmission grids and or even partnering with companies at the retail level to install gas-powered heating systems in buildings and residences.It may be too much to expect companies such as Woodside, Shell, Chevron and Exxon Mobil to do this on their own in fairly challenging markets, such as those in Asia or Africa.But they should be considering how best to partner with local companies in these countries to build out a network that could create sufficient LNG demand to once again justify the building of vastly expensive liquefaction projects.

Given Brent crude is currently around $40, it seems the price hurdle was probably too great for Browse.But so was the lack of customers keen to sign up to long-term, oil-linked contracts, something acknowledged by Woodside Chief Executive Peter Coleman.Asian buyers now hold the whip hand in LNG pricing, given the rapid growth in supply from new projects in Australia, five of which have started in the past two years and three more planned to start by 2017.In addition, the United States has exported its first LNG through the Sabine Pass facility and has four more projects currently under construction.The problem is that all these new projects have altered the supply-demand balance to the point where it's hard to see the market being able to absorb all the available LNG, even if prices continue to slump.Asian spot LNG was at $4.50 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) last week, close to the record low of $4.30 reached earlier this month and less than a quarter of the peak of $20.50 reached in February 2014. It's not only the new supply that has driven prices lower, demand has been softer than expected, with Japan's imports dropping for a sixth consecutive month in February, in what may well be confirmation of a structural decline in the world's biggest buyer of the super-cooled fuel.China, the big hope for LNG demand growth, has imported 14.3 percent more in the first two months of 2016 than it did for the same period last year, but it's worth noting that imports actually fell 1 percent last year.The spike in LNG purchases so far this year is most likely related to increased use of natural gas for heating, and this may not be sustained as winter comes to an end.However, overall China should still be a growth story for natural gas, given the authorities' determination to rely less on polluting coal.There is also the potential for greater LNG imports across Southeast Asia, with more countries planning to use the fuel, including Bangladesh, Myanmar, Vietnam and the Philippines. Traditional exporters Indonesia and Malaysia may well end up as net importers as well, given the depletion of their domestic natural gas fields and rising demand at home.But even if demand can rise to meet existing and under construction supply, this doesn't necessarily support the development of a raft of proposed projects.DOWNSTREAM KEY TO FUTURE PROJECTS There are proposals for new ventures in Australia, Canada, the United States, Russia and Mozambique, to name just a few.While some of these aim to be floating LNG platforms and some more conventional onshore plants, one thing they all have in common is that they will cost billions of dollars each. It's very hard to see multi-billion dollar projects moving to final investment decisions if long-term customers aren't signed up.What this means is that if any of these planned ventures are to see the light of day, their proponents will have to do more than build them in the hope that buyers will come.The industry needs to consider going downstream in order to ensure its long-term viability.Much like oil companies' move from producing oil into refining it and then retailing fuels, so too will LNG companies have to find ways to establish a sustainable market that will create and maintain demand for their product.This means investing in re-gasification terminals in developing nations, along with associated pipeline infrastructure and storages.It may also mean building gas-fired power plants, transmission grids and or even partnering with companies at the retail level to install gas-powered heating systems in buildings and residences.It may be too much to expect companies such as Woodside, Shell, Chevron and Exxon Mobil to do this on their own in fairly challenging markets, such as those in Asia or Africa.But they should be considering how best to partner with local companies in these countries to build out a network that could create sufficient LNG demand to once again justify the building of vastly expensive liquefaction projects.

674,"  HOUSTON The last group of union workers at Exxon Mobil Corp's (XOM.N) giant Baytown, Texas, refining and petrochemical complex voted on Thursday and Friday to accept a contract extension, a union official said on Friday night.Laboratory unit workers, who make up about 10 percent of the 700 United Steelworkers union (USW) members working hourly jobs at Baytown, joined with refinery and chemical plant workers who had accepted the four-year extension in voting on March 24 and 25. ""Their resolve through the extension has made them the flagship of all three units,"" USW Local 13-2001 President Ricky Brooks said of the laboratory workers after announcing the vote. Laboratory workers rejected the extension in voting last week, following the recommendation of USW leaders who had argued against accepting the company's first offer in talks to replace the current contract, which expires on May 15.An Exxon spokesman hailed the extension's ratification by all three units at Baytown.  ""We agree with this successful outcome and early settlement of the contract,"" said Exxon spokesman Todd Spitler. ""The negotiation process was successful and has resulted in an agreement that is mutually beneficial for both the union and the company.""After last week's vote, the USW had asked Exxon to renew the extension offer to give laboratory workers a second opportunity to vote on the proposal that provides a 3 percent increase in hourly wages in 2016 and again in 2017, and a 3.5 percent increase in 2018.  The increases are equal to those agreed to by the USW and U.S. refinery owners following a national strike in 2015.The pay level in 2019 will be equal to what the USW and refinery owners agree to in talks expected to begin in January 2019.

A hydrotreater is a unit that removes sulfur from oil products. In response to a question from Reuters, Exxon said in a statement ""the unit affected processes diesel fuel."" The sources said the unit, LHU 1, processes diesel.Energy industry intelligence service Genscape said activity at units it was monitoring at the refinery remained normal after the fire was extinguished. Television footage showed firefighters battling the blaze on one of the plant's towers. People in the vicinity and the U.S. Coast Guard's Vessel Traffic Service on the Houston Ship Channel had first reported smoke coming from the facility, which includes a chemical plant.Unrelated to the blaze, the Baytown refinery was boosting production for the first time since crude intake was cut in early February, the sources said. The refinery's largest crude distillation unit, the 280,300 bpd Pipestill 8, began taking in a larger amount of crude oil late on Tuesday and was continuing to do so on Thursday.  Exxon cut back the refinery's run rate in early February amid a glut of crude oil and gasoline in the United States.Exxon confirmed the increased production saying planned maintenance had been completed.

But gasoline buying and margins are surging as U.S. drivers rev up for the summer and consumers in China and India also hit the road in record numbers. Bank of America Merrill Lynch said it now expects global gasoline demand growth of 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) - some 65 percent above the 10-year average.Traders and analysts said such lopsided demand could depress diesel profits for at least another year, as refineries running for gasoline are configured in such a way that they cannot produce it without pumping out thousands of barrels of middle distillates that the world is not consuming.""The worst is definitely yet to come. The diesel crack can still move lower ... to negative, even,"" said JBC analyst Michael Dei-Michei, referring to the gap between the price of diesel and the cost of the crude needed to produce it - a measure of profitability. ""That's not out of the question.""Gasoline demand over the past year and a half defied all expectations as drivers spurred by cheap oil hit the road in huge numbers and bought more gas-guzzling SUVs. The development was a lifeline to oil producers, encouraging refineries around the world to run at full steam. But refiners, who for years struggled to produce enough diesel to power industrial growth worldwide and who bet on flat to falling gasoline demand due to more fuel-efficient cars, spent years and invested hundreds of millions to maximize diesel.   Saudi Aramco and its partners recently opened massive new refineries in the Middle East that were built to produce more than 60 percent middle distillates, while companies including ExxonMobil, Total, Galp and Repsol invested in European refineries to boost diesel. But now that they are up and running, the diesel outlets, such as oil drilling, railroads, construction and other heavy industries, are languishing. Figures in myriad countries, including China, Brazil and the United States, show diesel consumption flatlining or falling.A warm winter across the northern hemisphere kept households from burning heating oil at the usual pace, meaning stocks of distillates did not draw down as much as they normally would over the winter and the refinery maintenance season. ""There's nothing that can give a (diesel) demand boost until we have a cold winter,"" Dei-Michei said.  BURGEONING STOCKS, BITTER PILL A string of analysts have said economic run cuts – when refineries slow production to avoid producing unwanted or unprofitable fuel – will come to the rescue. But a variety of trading and refinery sources said that if gasoline demand grows at expected levels, the profits for selling it will keep refineries from slowing – placing even more diesel into glutted storage tanks and forcing margins lower.   ""It's a pretty bitter pill to swallow for those who invested (in diesel) to improve their margin,"" a European refinery source said. Refineries have been working for months to cut diesel production – doing everything from changing their crude slate to shutting upgrading units such as hydrocrackers. But sources said these efforts can sustainably cut only a maximum of around 2 percent for most refineries.""The European refining system is too exposed to diesel,"" one oil trader said. ""If 65 percent of your products are negative, you'd need $35 gasoline cracks"" to run on negative diesel margins. Still, Dei-Michei and others said a maintenance-season diesel stock draw, which dried out thousands of barrels from floating storage as well as on-land tanks, along with the construction of new tank space, means there is room in storage despite brimming stocks at hubs in Europe, Asia and Singapore.But the flood into storage could blunt diesel profits until as far as 2018. ""The last time diesel stocks were high at the end of 2009, we entered a period when diesel demand grew more than gasoline, and yet it still took years to run through those excess diesel inventories,"" said Andrew Reed, analyst with ESAI.

685,"   By Erwin Seba and Jessica Resnick-Ault | HOUSTON  HOUSTON A fire erupted at Exxon Mobil Corp's Baytown, Texas, refinery on Thursday afternoon, sending a large plume of black smoke into the air that was visible 22 miles (35 km) away in downtown Houston.Exxon said the fire was later extinguished, no workers were injured and output would not be curtailed at the 560,500 barrel per day (bpd) oil refinery, the second-largest in the United States.The company provided no specific information on the affected unit but said it would monitor air quality around the complex and the community.However, sources familiar with plant operations said the blaze broke out on a 20,000 bpd lube oil hydrotreating unit, said sources familiar with plant operations. A hydrotreater is a unit that removes sulfur from oil products. In response to a question from Reuters, Exxon said in a statement ""the unit affected processes diesel fuel."" The sources said the unit, LHU 1, processes diesel.Energy industry intelligence service Genscape said activity at units it was monitoring at the refinery remained normal after the fire was extinguished. Television footage showed firefighters battling the blaze on one of the plant's towers. People in the vicinity and the U.S. Coast Guard's Vessel Traffic Service on the Houston Ship Channel had first reported smoke coming from the facility, which includes a chemical plant.Unrelated to the blaze, the Baytown refinery was boosting production for the first time since crude intake was cut in early February, the sources said. The refinery's largest crude distillation unit, the 280,300 bpd Pipestill 8, began taking in a larger amount of crude oil late on Tuesday and was continuing to do so on Thursday.  Exxon cut back the refinery's run rate in early February amid a glut of crude oil and gasoline in the United States.Exxon confirmed the increased production saying planned maintenance had been completed.

688,"  (Adds company comment)HOUSTON, April 14 Exxon Mobil is shipping a cargo of crude produced from its deepwater Julia field in the Gulf of Mexico to its refinery in Rotterdam, Netherlands, marking the first export of offshore oil to leave a U.S. port since a ban was lifted.The crude came from initial well tests conducted on the Julia project, Aaron Stryk, a company spokesman, said in an emailed statement on Thursday.The oil company is sending a modest 18,000 barrels of oil on a Panamax tanker, the PGC Marina, according to a bill of lading published at Bloomberg terminals and Thomson Reuters vessel tracking data. Refiners typically do tests to see how new crudes will impact yields from making fuels. While only a small volume, the cargo is the first known export of offshore oil from the United States since Congress lifted a ban last December. Until now, all other shipments had been of light onshore oil. The vessel departed from Gramercy, Louisiana, in early April and is expected to arrive in Rotterdam on April 19, according to the data.It was not clear whether Exxon would continue to export Julia crude, but the firm anticipates an initial production of 34,000 barrels per day (bpd) following the startup of the field in the second quarter of this year, according to its website. Initial testing on the Julia field, a joint venture between Norway's Statoil and Exxon Mobil located roughly 200 miles south of New Orleans, Louisiana, began in March. .Commissioning activities are underway for the startup of the field, Stryk said in an email. Two wells are completed, and the company is in the process of drilling a third well.

The lower the oil price, the more cargoes needed to pay companies under contracts. But sources told Reuters that NNPC was taking nearly as much crude for itself as when oil was above $100, eating into oil companies' allotments.Exxon has confronted NNPC, sources said, by refusing to allocate barrels from the Erha stream - significantly delaying its loading programmes.

Nigeria, Africa's largest economy, relies on crude sales for the bulk of government revenues, but NNPC has reported losses since it began publishing its data from August last year.As NNPC's liquidity problems mount, it has turned to oil majors themselves to cover costs for joint venture projects, so-called ""cash calls"", making its oil debt to them even greater. NNPC already owes at least $3 billion in cash calls, according to NNPC head Emmanuel Ibe Kachikwu, and its finance minister said it plans to dip into money reserved for cash calls if revenue this year falls short of expectations.""NNPC has always had difficulties meeting its cash call - and that's the bottom of the issue,"" said Dolapo Oni, head of energy research at pan-African lender Ecobank. ""The IOCs get more cargoes diverted to them to cover these costs.""Nigeria badly needs revenue to fund a proposed 6.06 trillion naira ($30.6 billion) budget aimed at stimulating the economy. It is also increasingly turning to its crude to tame fuel shortages that began last month.""There aren't enough cargoes available to NNPC,"" Oni said of efforts to swap more crude for gasoline, adding ""they had to allocate those extra barrels to the IOCs"" to cover debts.Still, given the gravity of the situation, NNPC could continue to fight for cargoes.""Stopping a rebellion over fuel shortages is a priority right now,"" one source told Reuters.

Nigeria, Africa's largest economy, relies on crude sales for the bulk of government revenues, but NNPC has reported losses since it began publishing its data from August last year.As NNPC's liquidity problems mount, it has turned to oil majors themselves to cover costs for joint venture projects, so-called ""cash calls"", making its oil debt to them even greater. NNPC already owes at least $3 billion in cash calls, according to NNPC head Emmanuel Ibe Kachikwu, and its finance minister said it plans to dip into money reserved for cash calls if revenue this year falls short of expectations.""NNPC has always had difficulties meeting its cash call - and that's the bottom of the issue,"" said Dolapo Oni, head of energy research at pan-African lender Ecobank. ""The IOCs get more cargoes diverted to them to cover these costs.""Nigeria badly needs revenue to fund a proposed 6.06 trillion naira ($30.6 billion) budget aimed at stimulating the economy. It is also increasingly turning to its crude to tame fuel shortages that began last month.""There aren't enough cargoes available to NNPC,"" Oni said of efforts to swap more crude for gasoline, adding ""they had to allocate those extra barrels to the IOCs"" to cover debts.Still, given the gravity of the situation, NNPC could continue to fight for cargoes.""Stopping a rebellion over fuel shortages is a priority right now,"" one source told Reuters.

700,"   By Sonali Paul | MELBOURNE, April 22  MELBOURNE, April 22 Australia's competition watchdog wants to break up a marketing joint venture between ExxonMobil Corp and BHP Billiton  to help boost competition in the eastern Australian gas market, it said on Friday.Following a year-long investigation into gas supply concerns, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) concluded suppliers have ""taken advantage"" of potentially lower gas supply to eastern Australia end-users to raise prices and place onerous conditions on buyers.The study also found that pipeline operators in the region exercised market power to implement monopoly pricing. The operators were getting away with charging rates that gave them a return on equity up to 20 times higher than in recent decisions by the nation's energy regulator, the ACCC said.The gas supply tightness driving the higher prices followed new liquefied natural gas (LNG) plants built to export gas from Queensland that left less available for the domestic market.At the same time, with production declining in southern Australian states including Victoria, gas users are becoming more dependent on supply from the Bass Strait, produced and sold by ExxonMobil and BHP's Gippsland Basin Joint Venture (GBJV). ""The reduction in the diversity of gas suppliers in the southern states has substantially strengthened the competitive position of the GBJV,"" the ACCC said.The commission said that gas users in the southeast states, including Victoria and New South Wales, would have to pay substantially more for gas if they had to turn to supplies piped from Queensland that also have outlets to higher-priced international markets. One step it outlined to help deal with the problem for end-users was to consider ordering ExxonMobil and BHP to sell gas separately.Both companies are fighting the move, with ExxonMobil saying that separate marketing would increase costs.""Any unwinding of joint marketing will only increase those costs in the short term and make it more difficult to invest and bring on new supplies in Gippsland,"" it said. BHP said the joint venture, which has been producing for more than 45 years, had served the market well and was still meeting the market's needs.The commission also said more regulation was needed in the pipeline sector, sending shares of pipeline operator APA Group  down 3 percent on Friday.Manufacturers, including explosives and fertiliser maker Incitec Pivot Ltd, prompted the investigation, saying they were having difficulty lining up long-term gas supplies beyond 2016, which coincided with the start of LNG exports.""The additional ACCC reviews, in particular the investigation of the Gippsland Basin Joint Marketing Arrangements, are very important and should proceed quickly,"" Manufacturing Australia Chairman Mark Chellew said in an emailed statement.

702,"   By Ernest Scheyder  Exxon Mobil Corp lost its top-tier credit rating from Standard & Poor's on Tuesday for the first time in almost 70 years, as slumping crude prices crimp the oil giant's ability to fund projects and return big amounts of cash to shareholders.S&P, a unit of McGraw Hill Financial Inc, cut Exxon's rating to ""AA+"" from ""AAA,"" a one-notch demotion that leaves drugmaker Johnson & Johnson and Microsoft Corp as the only U.S. companies with the coveted, sterling rating that dozens of U.S. corporations enjoyed in the 1980s. Though the downgrade was a symbolic blow for a company that prides itself on strength and discipline, the new S&P rating for Exxon is still as high as its ratings for the U.S. government bonds, widely seen as among the world's safest investments. Only two other U.S. companies, General Electric Co. and Apple Inc., have S&P's ""AA+"" rating.Shares of Exxon, which is slated to post quarterly results on Friday, shrugged off the news, rising 0.34 percent to close at $87.63.Exxon and other energy companies have been under pressure to return money to shareholders. It spent $210 billion on share repurchases over the last decade, and during the fourth quarter, paid out $3.6 billion in dividends and share repurchases, more than it earned.Filings with U.S. regulators show that at a combined $325  billion in dividends and repurchases, Exxon’s spending on shareholders in the last 11 years has exceeded by nearly 20 percent its outlays for new property, plant and equipment of $271.7 billion in the same run, which account for the majority of its capital and exploration expenditures. But in February, with oil prices having fallen in half since mid-2014, Exxon changed course and said it would only repurchase shares to offset dilution, as opposed to returning cash to shareholders.  Still, S&P said Exxon's debt level had more than doubled in recent years due to growth projects including liquefied natural gas export facilities in Papua New Guinea, as well as dividends and other items, with overall spending exceeding cash flow.   In a statement about the downgrade, the world's largest publicly traded oil company made no indication it would make further changes in response to S&P move.""Nothing has changed in terms of the company’s financial philosophy or prudent management of its balance sheet,"" ExxonMobil spokesman Scott Silvestri said. Exxon added it values its strong credit position and will keep focusing on long-term shareholder value despite oil market volatility.Moody's in February affirmed its ""Aaa"" rating for Exxon with a negative outlook.

704,"   By Dion Rabouin | NEW YORK  NEW YORK The dollar fell on Tuesday after weaker-than-expected U.S. economic data boosted expectations the Federal Reserve would hold interest rates lower for longer, while U.S. Treasury yields touched five-week highs as traders made room for government debt supply ahead of the central bank's policy statement.U.S. durable goods orders rebounded less than anticipated in March and a survey of American consumer confidence missed expectations, adding to a slew of weak data on the U.S. economy in the first quarter.Tuesday's economic data ""plays into the idea that the Fed need not be in any rush to raise rates,"" said Richard Franulovich, senior currency strategist at Westpac Banking Corporation in New York.The lack of uncertainty about Wednesday's statement after a two-day meeting of the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee also led traders on Wall Street to hold stocks near their highest levels of the year.""I don't think there will be any surprises there,"" said Gordon Charlop, a managing director at Rosenblatt Securities in New York, of the Fed meeting.""Could they throw a curveball at us? Of course that's always a possibility, but that's not their style, and they've been pretty accommodative ... so I don't think traders are overly concerned.""The Dow Jones industrial average rose 13.08 points, or 0.07 percent, to 17,990.32, the S&P 500 gained 3.91 points, or 0.19 percent, to 2,091.7 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 7.48 points, or 0.15 percent, to 4,888.31. Fed funds futures show investors see no chance the U.S. central bank will raise benchmark interest rates above the current rate of 0.25 to 0.5 percent on Wednesday. Tuesday's unexpectedly weak data cut the likelihood of any rate hike in 2016, analysts said.""It is pretty much a given that the FOMC won't raise rates at this meeting, and may not raise rates until the end of the year,"" said Kevin Giddis, head of fixed income capital markets at Raymond James in Memphis, Tennessee.Markets see a 23 percent chance of interest rates rising in June, according to CME Group's FedWatch. As traders await the Fed's policy statement, due at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT) on Wednesday, sovereign debt supply on both sides of the Atlantic helped lift benchmark U.S. and German yields to or close to five-week highs.U.S. benchmark 10-year Treasury notes slipped 11/32 in price to yield 1.941 percent, the highest since March 23.The 30-year yield reached its highest since early February at 2.764 percent.The U.S. dollar index, which measures the dollar against a basket of six major currencies, fell 0.25 percent to 94.616. The weaker dollar and expectations that a persistent global oil glut would ease lifted oil prices, as did a 3-percent hike in U.S. gasoline and heating oil prices.Crude oil futures rose 3 percent with both Brent and U.S. crude approaching five-month highs touched last week.European bourses edged higher, boosted by a less-bad-than-expected 80 percent first-quarter profit fall and unchanged dividend from BP, as well as encouraging results from pulp and paper maker UPM.Emerging markets indexes rose along with Chinese stocks, while Japan's Nikkei was lower on the day.

In fact, markets see no chance of a rate increase at this week's meeting and are pricing in just about a one in five chance of a move at the next meeting on June 14-15.Yet, Fed officials have repeatedly said a hike in June is on the cards.""Even dovish policy makers such as (Boston Fed President Eric) Rosengren are saying market expectations are too low. And it is not hard to imagine many at the Fed feel current market rates are too low,"" said Tomoaki Shishido, fixed income strategist at Nomura Securities.""So the Fed may try to urge markets to price in higher rates. On balance, we are more likely to have a hawkish surprise than a dovish surprise,"" he added.Ahead of the Fed's meeting, the 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield stood at 1.8986 percent, easing from a four-week high of 1.914 percent seen on Monday.U.S. stocks fell on Monday as weaker oil prices weighed on energy shares, with the S&P 500 dipping 0.18 percent to 2,088, slipping further from a 4-1/2-month closing high of 2,102 hit last Wednesday. Oil prices recovered on Tuesday, pushed up by a weaker dollar and a flood of new cash into the market, but analysts warned of further weakness as producers continue to battle for customers.""The biggest bear risk to the oil market right now is that Iran's ramp-up accelerates and then Saudi Arabia does the same,"" analysts at Citibank said.U.S. crude rose 0.3 percent to $42.77 per barrel but remained down 2.2 percent this week.Brent crude advanced 0.3 percent to $44.62 per barrel, but is still 1.1 percent below its closing price on Friday.Both remained off five-month highs hit last week. On Monday, Saudi Arabia unveiled ambitious plans to transform its oil-dependent economy, centring on a partial privatisation of state oil company Saudi Aramco, which has  crude reserves of more than 15 percent of global oil deposits.The company is expected to be valued at over $2 trillion, more than five times the size of Exxon Mobil, ahead of the sale of less than 5 percent of it through an initial public offering (IPO).In the currency market, the dollar retreated against many major currencies while keeping its upper hand against emerging economy currencies.The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, slid 0.1 percent to 94.74, extending a 0.3 percent loss in the previous session.The dollar also slipped to 110.88 yen from three-week high of 111.90 touched early on Monday.The yen weakened sharply on Friday on a report that the BOJ is considering cutting rates at which the central bank lends money to banks. But doubts are growing about how effective such a measure would be in lifting the moribund economy.The Bank of Japan will make its policy announcement on Thursday.The euro held steady at $1.1265.The British pound held near a 10-week high as bets on a Brexit eased after U.S. President Barack Obama voiced his support for Britain's staying in the European Union.The pound last stood at $1.4490 after climbing as high as $1.4520 on Monday, its highest since mid-February.

712,"   By Ernest Scheyder | HOUSTON  HOUSTON Exxon Mobil Corp and Chevron Corpon Friday reported their most dismal quarterly results in more than a decade on low oil prices and an oversupplied fuel market that hurt what had been lucrative refining margins. As crude prices slid 60 percent from mid-2014, large integrated energy companies have touted the virtues of a business model that both produces oil and refines it. Refiners typically see profitability increase when the price of their main feedstock - oil - falls. But growing fuel inventories and weak demand are now hammering the refining industry, turning a typical advantage for integrated oil companies on its head.First-quarter pain in the downstream units, which came after major U.S. refiners slashed the amount of cheap crude they were processing in February, is a sign the road ahead for oil majors may turn even rockier. Their upstream exploration and production units have been reeling for months from the crude price crash.Both Exxon and Chevron sought in Friday conference calls with investors and analysts to downplay the weakness in their refining units.Chevron Chief Financial Officer Pat Yarrington acknowledged lower worldwide refining margins on the call.Jeff Woodbury, Exxon's vice president of investor relations, blamed the weak results on lower demand and high inventories of refined gasoline and other products after a relatively warm North American winter. Lower profits from Exxon and Chevron's refining divisions contributed to weaker overall results for both companies.Exxon's net income fell 63 percent to $1.81 billion, its lowest since 1999, although analysts had expected a bigger drop.Chevron, the second-largest U.S. oil company behind Exxon,  reported a net loss of $725 million, compared with a year-earlier net profit of $2.57 billion. The loss was the biggest since 2001, and earnings before special items missed Wall Street estimates.Exxon shares were up 0.2 percent at $88.20 in afternoon trading, while Chevron fell 0.8 percent to $101.59.        For the past six years, U.S. refiners from Texas to Philadelphia have bought every barrel of crude they could lay their hands on to cash in on a golden era of healthy margins.But those are fast disappearing. Among refiners, Marathon Petroleum Corp barely eked out a profit in the first quarter, and Phillip 66's consolidated earnings fell by more than half a billion dollars to $385 million. Profits were down by nearly half at $906 million at Exxon's refining unit and at $735 million at Chevron's.  In February, at least five U.S. refiners have voluntarily reduced output of fuels in the most widespread cuts since the global financial crisis.Independent refiners including Valero Energy Corp, PBF Energy Inc, Philadelphia Energy Solutions and Monroe Energy, a unit of Delta Air Lines Inc, have curbed output, capitulating to record stockpiles and sluggish demand.Exxon has also cut the amount of crude it processes at one Texas refinery.While so-called run cuts are common for maintenance, they are rare for purely economic reasons.If the closures gather pace and refineries curb their purchases of crude further, this will heap further pressure on oil prices exploration and production companies can command.

Some analysts are worried the strategy could leave it more vulnerable to a downturn.BP, Statoil and Total beat analysts' expectations for quarterly results this week, reflecting in part resilient refining and petrochemical operations.Eni, the biggest foreign oil producer in Africa, has said it is ready to sell down stakes in fields it operates, such as the massive Area 4 gas field in Mozambique and the giant Zohr field in Egypt, to bankroll development.The group could benefit from a partner in Mozambique that has the right skillset to help it develop the project, Mondazzi said on a conference call on first-quarter results.""This contract is so big I guess we could take advantage from a strong additional partner, not only stronger from a financial point of view but also (with) a capability to run such a complicated project,"" he said. Eni has been in talks to sell down its 50 percent stake in Area 4, which holds 85 trillion cubic feet of gas that will feed a series of onshore LNG export plants, mainly supplying Asia.Reuters reported in March that ExxonMobil was in talks to buy a stake of varying potential sizes in Eni's Area 4 development, including a full operating stake.""Talks on disposals are under way and some are very well advanced,"" Mondazzi said.Eni's strategy of selling down oil and gas acreage, its large reserves and ongoing restructuring all helped support a ""Buy"" rating, Santander oil analyst Jason Kenney said.""These should differentiate it from peers no matter where oil prices settle in coming months/years,"" he said. VENEZUELA DELAYS Mondazzi expressed concern, though, about developments in Venezuela where state oil company PDVSA, the exclusive operator of the country's oilfields, owes energy companies billions of dollars in unpaid bills due to cash-flow problems.""The situation in the country is critical. So far we've been paid but we envisage some delays in payment,"" he said, adding the amounts would not be huge.The group was testing certain financial securitization tools to help secure payments, he said.A slew of major U.S. corporations have taken sizeable writedowns on their Venezuela operations due primarily to a steadily weakening currency.Eni produces 60,000 boed in Venezuela, mainly from its giant gas field Perla.In the first quarter Eni beat operating profit expectations despite swinging to a net loss because of weak oil prices and a charge on its Saipem holding.Adjusted operating profit fell 95 percent to 73 million euros but was above an analyst consensus of 22 million euros.""This is a good set of results, especially in the light of the unfavourable conditions in the E&P (exploration and production) sector,"" broker ICBPI said in a note.

714,"  (Repeats to change keywords used by media clients)By Ernest ScheyderHOUSTON, April 29 Exxon Mobil Corp and Chevron Corp posted sharp drops in quarterly results on Friday as an oversupplied fuel market shrank profits from their refining units, which until now had provided healthy margins that helped insulate them from a 60 percent slide in oil prices since mid-2014.In this downturn, large integrated energy companies have touted the virtues of a business model that both produces oil and refines it. Refiners typically see profitability increase when the price of their main feedstock - oil - falls.But growing fuel inventories and weak demand are now hammering the refining industry, turning a typical advantage for integrated oil companies on its head.First-quarter pain in the downstream units, which came after major U.S. refiners slashed the amount of cheap crude they were processing in February, is a sign the road ahead for oil majors may turn even more rocky. Their upstream exploration and production units have been reeling for months from the crude price crash. ""Global refining margins weakened upon lower distal demand and continued surplus inventory,"" Jeff Woodbury, Exxon's vice president of investor relations, told analysts on a conference call.Lower profits from Exxon sand Chevron's refining divisions contributed to weaker overall results for both companies.Exxon reported net income of $1.81 billion, or 43 cents per share, down from $4.94 billion, or $1.17 per share, a year earlier. Chevron reported a net loss of $725 million, or 39 cents per share, compared with a year-earlier net profit of $2.57 billion, or $1.37 per share.For the past six years, U.S. refiners from Texas to Philadelphia have bought every barrel of crude they can lay their hands on to cash in on a golden era of healthy margins.But at least five U.S. refiners have voluntarily reduced output of fuels in the most widespread cuts since the global financial crisis. Independent refiners including Valero Energy Corp, PBF Energy Inc, Philadelphia Energy Solutions  and Monroe Energy, a unit of Delta Air Lines Inc, have curbed output, capitulating to record stockpiles and sluggish demand.Exxon has also cut the amount of crude it processes at one Texas refinery.While so-called run cuts are common for maintenance, they are rare for purely economic reasons.If the closures gather pace and refineries curb their purchases of crude further, this will heap further pressure on prices for crude received by exploration and production companies.(Reporting by Ernest Scheyder; Editing by Terry Wade and Lisa Von Ahn)",2016-04-29,XOM,"Fri Apr 29, 2016 | 10:18am EDT",RPT-WRAPUP 1-Refining's silver lining loses luster at Exxon and Chevron,http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-oil-results-idUSL2N17W0ZD?type=companyNews
715,"   By Ernest Scheyder | HOUSTON  HOUSTON Exxon Mobil Corp, the world's largest publicly traded oil producer, reported a higher-than-expected first-quarter profit on Friday as it slashed costs to offset plunging crude prices and weak refining margins.The results reflect the new reality for an oil industry hammered by a more than 60 percent drop in crude prices since 2014 that has forced radical reductions in spending and personnel. Exxon's capital budget during the first quarter dropped 33 percent from a year earlier, reflecting a drive to survive a price downturn that has already cost the company a perfect credit rating.      Exxon reported net income of $1.81 billion, or 43 cents per share, down from $4.94 billion, or $1.17 per share, a year earlier.Analysts on average expected earnings of 31 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Shares of Irving, Texas-based Exxon rose 0.6 percent to $88.60 in premarket trading.  Exxon Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson cited the company's large size and cash flow for helping it weather the low prices.""The organization continues to respond effectively to challenging industry conditions,"" Tillerson said in a news release.        Production rose 2 percent to 4.3 million barrels of oil equivalent per day. Exxon's oil and gas production arm lost money in the United States during the quarter. The company operates in North Dakota, Texas and other parts of the country. Internationally, profit at the oil and gas production arm fell 74 percent.The company's refining unit's profit fell 45 percent due to weak margins, unusual as these operations tend to perform better during periods of low oil and gas prices.     Exxon earlier this week had raised its dividend by 3 percent, one of the smallest increases in years. Historically, increases have ranged from 5 percent to 10 percent or more.During the first quarter, Exxon spent more on its dividend than it earned.The dividend increase came the day after Standard and Poor's slashed the company's sterling credit rating by one notch to ""AA+,"" citing concern about Exxon's quarterly payout to shareholders.

719,"   By Alister Doyle and Gwladys Fouche | OSLO  OSLO Norway's $872-billion sovereign wealth fund, the world's largest, said it would press U.S. oil majors ExxonMobil and Chevron to do more to report on the risks of climate change.The fund said on Tuesday it would vote in favor of shareholder proposals, opposed by both companies' boards, which would require them to report more fully about the risks and opportunities of a changing climate.Royal Dutch Shell and BP adopted similar policies last year, following shareholder pressure, it said. Exxon and Chevron both say they are already doing enough to report on climate risks.""We want them to be open about their climate strategy and their dialogue with regulators,"" the fund's chief executive Yngve Slyngstad told reporters. Firms should be clear about risks, both from the impacts of climate change such as floods and storms, as well as from government policies to curb carbon emissions, he said. The fund, itself built from Norway's oil and gas wealth, was making similar demands of oil firms worldwide and would keep going even if the resolutions were defeated at Exxon's and Chevron's annual general meetings, both on May 25.""We will then come back next year and the year after,"" he said. Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM), which manages the fund, was the seventh-largest shareholder of both firms at the end of 2015, Thomson Reuters Eikon data shows.Slyngstad said the fund, which owns about 1 percent of listed equities worldwide, had 4,000 meetings with major companies a year to discuss its investments. He said many companies were planning to cut their greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent in coming years to help achieve goals set at a 195-nation Paris summit on climate change in December that include phasing out emissions by 2100.Companies ""have to explain if they don't intend to reduce their emissions to that extent,"" he said. The fund said last week that it may exclude another 40 companies for using coal in their operations after divesting from 52 since Norway's parliament last year told it to sell out of firms that get more than 30 percent of their turnover or activity from coal. Slyngstad said it was hard to set firm rules, saying a power company generating 30 percent of its electricity from coal and 70 percent from wind might stay in the portfolio ahead of a firm using 30 percent coal and the rest fossil fuels.""The fund is like a supertanker, It takes some time to turn it."" At the end of 2015, NBIM said it held a 0.78 percent stake in Exxon, valued at $2.54 billion, while its 0.85 percent holding in Chevron was worth $1.45 billion.

722,"   By Ernest Scheyder | HOUSTON  HOUSTON Exxon Mobil Corp, which has been fighting accusations it misled investors and the public for years about the risks of climate change, said on Thursday it will expand a research project with FuelCell Energy Inc that aims to cut the cost of collecting carbon emissions from power plants.        The companies hope to use fuel cells, rather than exhaust scrubbers, the industry standard, to capture emissions from natural gas-fired plants and at the same time generate electricity. Scrubbers typically consume power as they filter carbon.Exxon has announced several alternative energy projects in recent years. The company says the projects have nothing to do with recent public outcry over its climate change disclosures, but are part of research into carbon sequestration and alternative fuels.Exxon, the largest natural gas producer in the United States, and FuelCell Energy declined to provide financial details of the project.A fuel cell generates power from gas, hydrogen or other fuels and converts it to electricity. Exxon investors and attorneys general around the United States have alleged the oil giant withheld internal studies on carbon emissions and global temperature change for decades.    Exxon has repeatedly denied the allegations. Vijay Swarup, Exxon's vice president for research and development, said the FuelCell Energy joint venture is not a reaction to public pressure. ""This is one component of a research portfolio that has been in place for several years,"" Swarup said.FuelCell Energy, whose market value is less than 1 percent of Exxon's, said it will provide 15 to 20 scientists for the project, which will take place at the company's Danbury, Conn., headquarters.Exxon said it would devote as many of its scientists as needed. Executives declined to provide a specific number. Both companies will share patents on any developed technology.FuelCell Energy, whose second-largest shareholder is utility NRG Energy Inc, makes small-scale power plants across the United States. Exxon contacted the company in 2011 to begin research, said Chip Bottone, FuelCell Energy's chief executive. ""It's critical that we have someone like Exxon, with their expertise, to create this market opportunity,"" said Bottone.Exxon, which last week reported its smallest quarterly profit since 1999, sponsors other carbon and alternative energy projects.Last year, Exxon gave $1 million to the Colorado School of Mines to study algal biofuels. In January, Exxon said it would partner with the Renewable Energy Group to find ways cellulosic sugars can be used to make biodiesel.

730,"  LONDON/NEW YORK Damage to a pipeline has reduced supplies of Nigeria's benchmark Qua Iboe crude oil, two traders said on Thursday, the latest setback for Africa's top producer that has pushed output to its lowest in more than two decades.Operator Exxon Mobil Corp confirmed in an email that a drilling rig, experiencing mechanical difficulties, damaged the pipeline it jointly owns with the state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) and caused a spill on Sunday.Exxon said Mobil Producing Nigeria (MPN) continues to assess the situation. It did not give any other details and it was not clear how much output was lost.The drilling rig is owned by Depthwize Nigeria Limited and Drilling on behalf of Conoil Producing. The news intensified concerns among traders and refiners about falling supplies of Nigeria's largest grade of crude and helped boost global Brent benchmark futures on Thursday even as the market remains awash with supplies. [O/R]   A series of recent outages in Nigeria have cut output by more than 400,000 barrels per day, excluding the latest problem with the pipeline, according to FG Energy.   The country was set to export 317,000 bpd of Qua Iboe in June. The news comes as Nigeria's production slumped to a 22-year low after Royal Dutch Shell PLC declared a force majeure on Bonny Light crude due to sabotage on a pipeline.Last week, a group known as Niger Delta Avengers attacked a Chevron facility in the Delta after also claiming a strike in February against a Shell pipeline, which shut down the 250,000 bpd Forcados export terminal.     The U.S. East Coast, historically, has been among the world's biggest buyer of Nigerian crude. Refiners there have binged on the country's crude in recent months as economics have shifted in favor of waterborne barrels rather than buying from the U.S. Bakken shale heartland.""The good news is the world is swimming in crude oil, so there are options. This may make it economical to ship Eagle Ford crude or maybe ship in some North Sea crude,"" Sarah Emerson, a managing principal at ESAI Energy LLC, said.

732,"  HOUSTON The overhaul of the small crude distillation unit at Exxon Mobil Corp's 344,600 barrel per day (bpd) refinery in Beaumont, Texas is expected to be slowed due to a fatal accident, sources familiar with plant operations said.A contract worker died after he was struck by a portion of a giant heat exchanger included in the overhaul of the 110,000 bpd Crude A CDU at about 12:30 a.m. CDT (0530 GMT) on Wednesday, the sources said. An Exxon spokesman declined to discuss the pace of planned maintenance at the refinery. The company has not said what units are shut down for the work. ""We are currently focused on the investigation and the tragic incident today, it would be inappropriate to comment or speculate on timelines at this point,"" said Exxon's Todd Spitler.The worker's name has not been released. He was an employee of AltairStrickland, an industrial engineering company specializing in refinery and petrochemical plant projects.  AltairStrickland did not reply to phone messages requesting comment.  KBMT-TV in Beaumont said the deceased worker was 37 years old and from Brownsville, Texas.  In addition to delays stemming from work being stopped at the location of the accident, the investigation by the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration could also slow or temporarily stop the overhaul, the sources said.  Exxon shut the small CDU on April 22 for a revamp scheduled to finish by June 30. The work is to prepare the unit for an expansion of the refinery with the eventual addition of a third CDU that would at least double the Beaumont refinery's capacity. The refinery's large CDU, the 240,000 bpd Crude B Unit, remains in operation at the Beaumont refinery. CDUs do the initial refining of crude oil coming into a refinery and provide feedstock for all other units.

733,"  * Exxon declares force majeure on major crude stream* Explosion hits Chevron facility in Nigeria's delta* Nigerian output already down to 1.65 mln bpd from 2.2 mln* Output could fall to lowest since 1970   (Updates bullet points, adds detail on explosion in Nigeria, no comment from Chevron)By Florence Tan and Simon FalushSINGAPORE/LONDON, May 13 U.S. oil major Exxon Mobil Corp said on Friday it has suspended exports from Nigeria's top crude stream, adding to economic strains from unrest and violence that have cut production to its lowest in decades.Exxon Mobil said it had declared a force majeure - a suspension of deliveries because of events beyond its control - on Nigeria's Qua Iboe crude oil grade BFO-QUA, and that a portion of production had been curtailed after a drilling rig damaged a pipeline. In a separate incident on Friday, an explosion rocked  Chevron Corp's oil well at the Marakaba pipeline in Warri in Nigeria's Delta region, a security source said, the second blast at a facility of the U.S. oil major within a week, feeding concern over a revived militant campaign in the area.Chevron had no immediate comment, while Nigeria's army, which has stepped up its presence in the region, could not immediately be reached for comment.Last week, Chevron said its platform in the Delta was attacked by militants.The outages adds to production problems at two of the other largest crude streams, Bonny Light and Forcados, which have already taken Nigeria's output to a 22-year low. Royal Dutch Shell shut a major pipeline earlier this week and declared force majeure on Bonny Light crude exports on Wednesday, while an attack in February on a pipeline also caused it to shut the 250,000 bpd Forcados export terminal.Nigeria's oil production has fallen to 1.65 million barrels per day (bpd) due to militant attacks, Finance Minister Kemi Adeosun said on Friday, from 2.2 million bpd.If outages at Qua Iboe and other streams are prolonged, Nigerian output could fall to around 1.2 million bpd, according to Reuters calculations. This would be the lowest output since 1970, according to BP's statistical review. Nigeria had been Africa's largest crude exporter with its economy heavily reliant on oil up until this year, when rampant oil theft and corruption has kept production well below capacity.As a result, Angola has overtaken Nigeria as the continent's largest producer since March, according to OPEC figures.Oil prices have jumped around 20 percent so far this quarter, their biggest such rise since 2011.Brent crude has surged to $47 per barrel from $27 in January, in part because of production problems in Africa's former largest producer as well as a decline in U.S. output.Nigeria was due to export 337,000 bpd in May, according to initial loading programmes released in March.(Additional reporting by Libby George in Washington D.C., Terry Wade in Houston, Felix Felix Onuah in Abuja and Tife Owolabi in YENAGOA, Nigeria); Editing by Ruth Pitchford and Marguerita Choy)",2016-05-13,XOM,"Fri May 13, 2016 | 4:31pm EDT",UPDATE 3-Nigeria faces oil output slump as Exxon shuts flows,http://www.reuters.com//article/africa-oil-exxon-mobil-idUSL3N18A34L?type=companyNews

748,"  (Recasts, adds militant threat)By Libby George and Tife OwolabiNEW YORK/YENAGOA, Nigeria May 19 Nigeria's oil production showed further signs of strain on Thursday as intruders blocked access to Exxon Mobil's terminal exporting Qua Iboe, the country's largest crude stream.Exxon Mobil said the terminal continued to operate even as the intruders blocked staff from gaining access from early morning hours. The incident is the latest in a string of attacks and other problems at the oil infrastructure in Africa's largest crude producer.""Some unknown persons obstructed access to the bridge leading to (the terminal), thereby preventing our personnel and the public from conducting their legitimate businesses,"" a spokesman said in an email.""A peaceful removal of the obstructions is ongoing,"" after intervention from government, security agencies and community leaders, the spokesman said, adding that Exxon ""condemns this criminality."" Samuel Ayande, chairman of the Artisan Fishermen Association, which is in contact with various locals who have information about developments on the ground, said a threatening letter from militants was impacting Exxon's decision over staffing and operations at the terminal.Exxon directed enquiries about militant threats to security agencies, though it said the company had ""plans in place to assure the security of our personnel and assets."" The spokesman did not respond to earlier reports that the facility was emptied of crude or that Exxon had removed staff from the terminal.Militant activity in the oil-rich Niger Delta has taken out some 500,000 barrels per day of crude oil production from other companies in Nigeria, pushing oil output in Africa's largest-producing nation to more than 22-year lows.While President Muhammadu Buhari has extended a multi-million-dollar amnesty signed with militants in 2009, he upset them by ending generous pipeline protection contracts. He also cut the amnesty budget, which partly funds training for unemployed, by around 70 percent. The Niger Delta Avengers, a little-known radical group which has claimed a string of attacks on pipelines, has warned oil companies to leave the region within two weeks and has said it wanted a greater share of oil revenues and an end to oil pollution.An oil industry source told Reuters that key support staff were at the Qua Iboe terminal, but non-essential workers had been sent home.The stream is currently under force majeure due to an earlier accident that damaged a pipeline and caused a spill, but sources told Reuters earlier this week that Exxon had been ramping up production.Qua Iboe exports more than 300,000 barrels per day. While Nigeria's exports are typically close to 2 million barrels per day, they have fallen to below 1.4 million this month due to the attacks and issues.

754,"  * Protesters block Fos fuel depot* Exxon says strike has not hindered refinery output* Total shutting down three of five refineries   (Adds updated details from Total, strike at Elengy)By Bate FelixPARIS, May 23 France's hardline CGT and FO unions toughened their stance against labour market reforms on Monday by launching a strike at oil and LNG terminals, and blockading a fuel depot in the southern port city of Marseille.The rolling strikes, which began in March and have gathered pace in recent weeks, have disrupted fuel supplies in France since Friday with protesting workers blockading petrol depots and halting production at refineries.French oil and gas company Total, which operates five of the eight refineries in France, said it has started the process of shutting down its Normandy and Donges refineries. It said in a statement the strikes had led to the shutdown of the Grandpuits refinery near the French capital, and its Feyzin refinery, while La Mede refinery was running at minimum output level due to a blockade.Rival Exxon Mobil said the strike has not affected output at its two refineries but striking workers had blockaded the oil terminal at Fos-sur-Mer in southern France.Oil sector workers in the CGT, which is France's biggest trade union, and at the third biggest FO, said on Monday they planned to intensify the action until the government withdraws a labour reform law, because they say it will hurt workers.""It is clear that the dissatisfaction with the law is unwavering,"" the unions said in a statement. As part of efforts to force the government to withdraw the bill, the union launched a strike at the Fos-Lavera oil terminals on Monday.""No ship is operating at the installations,"" Pascal Galéoté, CGT Secretary General at Marseille port told Reuters.The terminals supply PetroIneos Lavera, Total's La Mede and Exxon's Fos refineries on the southern coast. They also supply Total's Feyzin; Varo's Cressier in Switzerland and the MiRO refinery in Karlsruhe, Germany, via pipelines. Another branch of CGT said that workers at Elengy,  which operates three liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals in France will also join the strike from midnight on Monday.A similar prolonged strike at French refineries in 2010 led to a glut of crude in Europe because it could not be delivered, and a spike in refined product prices due to low output.The French government has moved to reassure the public that France was not running out of fuel after shortages at hundreds of petrol stations in several regions sparked panic buying.Finance Minister Michel Sapin accused CGT of holding France hostage, saying the government would take the necessary action to end the blockades and restart production at refineries.Total said in a statement it had begun the procedure of shutting down its 247,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) Normandy; 220,000 bpd Donges and 117,000 bpd Feyzin refineries. Its 101,000 bpd Grandpuits refinery was running at minimum output.It said 678 out of its 2,200 petrol stations across France had partially or completely run out of fuel, while striking workers were blockading two out of its nine fuel depots. There are 78 primary fuel depots in mainland France.

755,"  Shareholders of Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) and Chevron Corp (CVX.N), two of the world's largest oil producers, will vote on Wednesday on a raft of proposals designed to push the companies to respond more proactively to climate change risks and regulations.   The stakes are highest at Exxon, which has come under intense scrutiny from environmentalists and some investors this past year over the way it handled climate change data. With public sentiment pressuring big oil companies on environmental issues, the votes this year could mark the first time a climate change-related proposal passes muster with a majority of Exxon's shareholders.Below is a summary of key issues on ballots for the annual meetings:EXXON MOBIL  RESOLUTION 5: ADD CLIMATE EXPERT TO BOARD The resolution's sponsor, a group of Wisconsin monks, says that by adding a climate expert to its board, Exxon would be able to ""more effectively address the environmental issues and risks inherent in its present business model.""Exxon's recommended vote: No. Executives say holding a board seat for a ""single-issue candidate who lacks other important attributes would, in our view, not be in the best interests of the company.""RESOLUTION 7: PROXY ACCESS BYLAW This resolution's sponsor, New York City pension funds, says minority shareholders with a 3 percent stake in the company should be able to nominate directors to the company's board. This is part of a broader shareholder push to put climate experts on the boards of oil companies.Exxon's recommended vote: No. It highlighted ""the potential risk for the proposal to increase the influence of special interest groups"" on the board.RESOLUTION 10: BOOST SHAREHOLDER PAYOUTS This resolution's sponsor, an investor with 200 shares, wants Exxon to increase dividends and share buybacks, rather than invest in new oil or gas deposits, claiming that climate change throws the long-term viability of the company's business model into doubt.Exxon's recommended vote: No. Executives defended their history of generous shareholder payouts and noted they use a proxy cost for carbon, which takes into account potential impacts from climate change and environmental legislation. RESOLUTION 11: SUPPORT THE PARIS AGREEMENT This resolution's sponsor, a group of New Jersey nuns, wants Exxon to support the Paris climate accords with a company policy that commits to limit global warming to less than 2 degrees Celsius. Exxon's recommended vote: No. Executives said they take the risks of climate change seriously and also have an obligation to ""invest in economically attractive energy sources in an environmentally responsible manner.""RESOLUTION 12: PUBLISH AN ANNUAL CLIMATE CHANGE REPORT This resolution's sponsor, the New York State Common Retirement Fund, which holds nearly 11 million Exxon shares, wants the company to publish a report annually that would outline how climate change could affect the company's ability to operate.Exxon's recommended vote: No. Executives noted the company already updates its annual Outlook For Energy report with the latest climate policy information.RESOLUTION 13: REPORT RESERVES IN BRITISH THERMAL UNITS  The resolution's sponsor, the environmental group As You Sow, wants Exxon to report its reserves of oil and natural gas in British Thermal Units, arguing it is a better metric to track the company's effect on, and vulnerability to, climate change.Exxon's recommended vote: No. Executives note the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission requires oil assets be reported in barrels.CHEVRON  Note: Chevron does not identify resolution sponsors.RESOLUTION 6: TARGETS FOR GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS CUTS The sponsor wants Chevron to set goals for how the company can best comply with the Paris climate agreements and arrange its business operations in such a way as to help limit global warming to less than 2 degrees C.Chevron's recommended vote: No. Executives say such a requirement could put the company at an economic disadvantage in some countries where it operates. RESOLUTION 7: CLIMATE CHANGE REPORT The sponsor wants Chevron to publish an annual report from 2017 through 2035 outlining how legislation designed to curb climate change could affect its business operations. Chevron's recommended vote: No. Executives say such a report is ""unnecessary in light of the safeguards"" in place throughout its operations.RESOLUTION 8: REPORT RESERVES IN BRITISH THERMAL UNITS  The sponsor wants Chevron to report its reserves of oil and natural gas in British Thermal Units, arguing it is a better metric to track the company's effect on, and vulnerability to, climate change.Chevron's recommended vote: No. Executives note the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission requires oil assets be reported in barrels.RESOLUTION 9: BOOST SHAREHOLDER PAYOUTS This sponsor wants Chevron to increase dividends and share buybacks, claiming that climate change throws the long-term viability of the company's business model into doubt.Chevron's recommended vote: No. Executives say the proposal is based on a ""flawed, if not dangerous, premise: that stockholders would be best served if Chevron stopped investing in its business.""RESOLUTION 11: BOARD MEMBER WITH ENVIRONMENTAL EXPERTISE This sponsor wants more candidates for Chevron's board with a ""high level of expertise and experience in environmental matters"" who are also independent of the company's management.Chevron's recommended vote: No. Executives say the current board has ""significant environmental experience.""

757,"   By Ernest Scheyder and Terry Wade | HOUSTON  HOUSTON Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) and Chevron Corp (CVX.N) will face their toughest-ever push by shareholders concerned about a warming world at annual meetings on Wednesday, as the Paris accord to tackle climate change ratchets up investor pressure on two of the world's largest oil companies.The tension is most acute at Exxon, which has denied accusations from environmentalists that it purposely misled the public about climate change risks. The New York attorney general is investigating Exxon and it has complained of being unfairly targeted by special interest groups.The raft of proposals up for vote at the two companies more than doubled to 11 this year, the latest sign that environmental concerns once considered peripheral by many investors have become mainstream. Even the most traditional shareholder groups are now urging companies to detail how they will plan for the future after 195 governments agreed in December to limit the rise in global temperatures to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) through combined national pledges to cut carbon emissions from fossil fuels.""Companies like Exxon and Chevron, they're clinging to bygone assumptions,"" said Anne Simpson of CalPERS, which holds Exxon shares worth about $1 billion and has supported some of the measures. ""This is their Kodak moment. If they want to still be in business in 30 years, they have to understand the changes that are taking place."" Though ""Kodak moment"" was originally an advertising slogan for film and cameras, it can now refer to Eastman Kodak's plunge into bankruptcy in 2012 after it failed to capitalize on the digital camera revolution. Simpson said Exxon and Chevron should ramp up investments in clean energy to avoid being caught by sudden technology shifts.While BP Plc (BP.L), Statoil ASA (STL.OL) and other European oil companies have begun releasing myriad data points on how their businesses will respond to climate change, Chevron and Exxon have lagged them, critics say.Success of any one of the climate-related votes at Wednesday's meetings is not certain. TIDE TURNING? Exxon shareholders have never approved a climate change-related proposal, and last year they rejected by 79 percent a request that a climate expert be appointed to the company's board.Another measure, which would have the companies increase payouts to shareholders and stop investing in oil and gas deposits, appears doomed to fail. Still, environmentalists and some investors, sensing the tide turning in their favor, hope to notch at least some victories.Already, proxy advisory firm ISS has recommended shareholders of both companies support the resolutions, a key voice of support.Exxon lost a public battle with New York State's comptroller earlier this year when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ruled it must let shareholders vote on a proposal that would require it to detail how its business will be hurt as governments crack down on carbon emissions.""We believe it's incumbent upon us as owners to find out what they're doing (on climate research) and how that will affect their long-term business plan,"" said Pete Grannis of New York State's comptroller's office. ""It's almost impossible to imagine they haven't been doing some of this already."" The so-called proxy access measure, which says minority shareholders with a 3 percent stake should be able to nominate directors to the company's board, could pass this year after winning support from mutual fund behemoth Vanguard.More than a dozen oil companies have passed proxy access, though Exxon's board has opposed it. Insiders at oil companies worry proxy access could lead to climate activists opposed to oil drilling being voted on to company boards.Though both Exxon and Chevron say their climate disclosures are plenty robust, shareholders are demanding more at annual meetings, partly because the SEC has declined their requests to tighten its 2010 rule requiring all U.S. companies to address potential climate change impacts.          ""For the most part the SEC has not been too responsive, so investors have had to turn to other methods,"" said Jim Coburn of Ceres, a sustainability group that has advocated at the SEC for tougher climate standards as far back as 2007 with CalPERS, the New York attorney general's office and numerous state treasurers.

765,"   By Ernest Scheyder and Terry Wade | HOUSTON  HOUSTON Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) and Chevron Corp (CVX.N) will face their toughest-ever push by shareholders concerned about a warming world at annual meetings on Wednesday, as the Paris accord to tackle climate change ratchets up investor pressure on two of the world's largest oil companies.The tension is most acute at Exxon, which has denied accusations from environmentalists that it purposely misled the public about climate change risks. The New York attorney general is investigating Exxon and it has complained of being unfairly targeted by special interest groups.The raft of proposals up for vote at the two companies more than doubled to 11 this year, the latest sign that environmental concerns once considered peripheral by many investors have become mainstream. Even the most traditional shareholder groups are now urging companies to detail how they will plan for the future after 195 governments agreed in December to limit the rise in global temperatures to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) through combined national pledges to cut carbon emissions from fossil fuels.""Companies like Exxon and Chevron, they're clinging to bygone assumptions,"" said Anne Simpson of CalPERS, which holds Exxon shares worth about $1 billion and has supported some of the measures. ""This is their Kodak moment. If they want to still be in business in 30 years, they have to understand the changes that are taking place."" Though ""Kodak moment"" was originally an advertising slogan for film and cameras, it can now refer to Eastman Kodak's plunge into bankruptcy in 2012 after it failed to capitalize on the digital camera revolution. Simpson said Exxon and Chevron should ramp up investments in clean energy to avoid being caught by sudden technology shifts.While BP Plc (BP.L), Statoil ASA (STL.OL) and other European oil companies have begun releasing myriad data points on how their businesses will respond to climate change, Chevron and Exxon have lagged them, critics say.Success of any one of the climate-related votes at Wednesday's meetings is not certain. TIDE TURNING? Exxon shareholders have never approved a climate change-related proposal, and last year they rejected by 79 percent a request that a climate expert be appointed to the company's board.Another measure, which would have the companies increase payouts to shareholders and stop investing in oil and gas deposits, appears doomed to fail. Still, environmentalists and some investors, sensing the tide turning in their favor, hope to notch at least some victories.Already, proxy advisory firm ISS has recommended shareholders of both companies support the resolutions, a key voice of support.Exxon lost a public battle with New York State's comptroller earlier this year when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ruled it must let shareholders vote on a proposal that would require it to detail how its business will be hurt as governments crack down on carbon emissions.""We believe it's incumbent upon us as owners to find out what they're doing (on climate research) and how that will affect their long-term business plan,"" said Pete Grannis of New York State's comptroller's office. ""It's almost impossible to imagine they haven't been doing some of this already."" The so-called proxy access measure, which says minority shareholders with a 3 percent stake should be able to nominate directors to the company's board, could pass this year after winning support from mutual fund behemoth Vanguard.More than a dozen oil companies have passed proxy access, though Exxon's board has opposed it. Insiders at oil companies worry proxy access could lead to climate activists opposed to oil drilling being voted on to company boards.Though both Exxon and Chevron say their climate disclosures are plenty robust, shareholders are demanding more at annual meetings, partly because the SEC has declined their requests to tighten its 2010 rule requiring all U.S. companies to address potential climate change impacts.          ""For the most part the SEC has not been too responsive, so investors have had to turn to other methods,"" said Jim Coburn of Ceres, a sustainability group that has advocated at the SEC for tougher climate standards as far back as 2007 with CalPERS, the New York attorney general's office and numerous state treasurers.

766,"  Shareholders of Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) and Chevron Corp (CVX.N), two of the world's largest oil producers, will vote on Wednesday on a raft of proposals designed to push the companies to respond more proactively to climate change risks and regulations.   The stakes are highest at Exxon, which has come under intense scrutiny from environmentalists and some investors this past year over the way it handled climate change data. With public sentiment pressuring big oil companies on environmental issues, the votes this year could mark the first time a climate change-related proposal passes muster with a majority of Exxon's shareholders.Below is a summary of key issues on ballots for the annual meetings:EXXON MOBIL  RESOLUTION 5: ADD CLIMATE EXPERT TO BOARD The resolution's sponsor, a group of Wisconsin monks, says that by adding a climate expert to its board, Exxon would be able to ""more effectively address the environmental issues and risks inherent in its present business model.""Exxon's recommended vote: No. Executives say holding a board seat for a ""single-issue candidate who lacks other important attributes would, in our view, not be in the best interests of the company.""RESOLUTION 7: PROXY ACCESS BYLAW This resolution's sponsor, New York City pension funds, says minority shareholders with a 3 percent stake in the company should be able to nominate directors to the company's board. This is part of a broader shareholder push to put climate experts on the boards of oil companies.Exxon's recommended vote: No. It highlighted ""the potential risk for the proposal to increase the influence of special interest groups"" on the board.RESOLUTION 10: BOOST SHAREHOLDER PAYOUTS This resolution's sponsor, an investor with 200 shares, wants Exxon to increase dividends and share buybacks, rather than invest in new oil or gas deposits, claiming that climate change throws the long-term viability of the company's business model into doubt.Exxon's recommended vote: No. Executives defended their history of generous shareholder payouts and noted they use a proxy cost for carbon, which takes into account potential impacts from climate change and environmental legislation. RESOLUTION 11: SUPPORT THE PARIS AGREEMENT This resolution's sponsor, a group of New Jersey nuns, wants Exxon to support the Paris climate accords with a company policy that commits to limit global warming to less than 2 degrees Celsius. Exxon's recommended vote: No. Executives said they take the risks of climate change seriously and also have an obligation to ""invest in economically attractive energy sources in an environmentally responsible manner.""RESOLUTION 12: PUBLISH AN ANNUAL CLIMATE CHANGE REPORT This resolution's sponsor, the New York State Common Retirement Fund, which holds nearly 11 million Exxon shares, wants the company to publish a report annually that would outline how climate change could affect the company's ability to operate.Exxon's recommended vote: No. Executives noted the company already updates its annual Outlook For Energy report with the latest climate policy information.RESOLUTION 13: REPORT RESERVES IN BRITISH THERMAL UNITS  The resolution's sponsor, the environmental group As You Sow, wants Exxon to report its reserves of oil and natural gas in British Thermal Units, arguing it is a better metric to track the company's effect on, and vulnerability to, climate change.Exxon's recommended vote: No. Executives note the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission requires oil assets be reported in barrels.CHEVRON  Note: Chevron does not identify resolution sponsors.RESOLUTION 6: TARGETS FOR GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS CUTS The sponsor wants Chevron to set goals for how the company can best comply with the Paris climate agreements and arrange its business operations in such a way as to help limit global warming to less than 2 degrees C.Chevron's recommended vote: No. Executives say such a requirement could put the company at an economic disadvantage in some countries where it operates. RESOLUTION 7: CLIMATE CHANGE REPORT The sponsor wants Chevron to publish an annual report from 2017 through 2035 outlining how legislation designed to curb climate change could affect its business operations. Chevron's recommended vote: No. Executives say such a report is ""unnecessary in light of the safeguards"" in place throughout its operations.RESOLUTION 8: REPORT RESERVES IN BRITISH THERMAL UNITS  The sponsor wants Chevron to report its reserves of oil and natural gas in British Thermal Units, arguing it is a better metric to track the company's effect on, and vulnerability to, climate change.Chevron's recommended vote: No. Executives note the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission requires oil assets be reported in barrels.RESOLUTION 9: BOOST SHAREHOLDER PAYOUTS This sponsor wants Chevron to increase dividends and share buybacks, claiming that climate change throws the long-term viability of the company's business model into doubt.Chevron's recommended vote: No. Executives say the proposal is based on a ""flawed, if not dangerous, premise: that stockholders would be best served if Chevron stopped investing in its business.""RESOLUTION 11: BOARD MEMBER WITH ENVIRONMENTAL EXPERTISE This sponsor wants more candidates for Chevron's board with a ""high level of expertise and experience in environmental matters"" who are also independent of the company's management.Chevron's recommended vote: No. Executives say the current board has ""significant environmental experience.""

771,"   By Ron Bousso and Karolin Schaps | LONDON  LONDON Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) plans to increase cost savings to $4.5 billion following its $54 billion acquisition of BG Group which Chief Executive Officer Ben van Beurden said will make it the best oil company investment, ahead of Exxon Mobil (XOM.N).In its first long-term strategy presentation since February's deal, Shell unveiled plans to limit spending and exit countries in order to focus on the most profitable operations such as liquefied natural gas (LNG), deepwater oil production and chemicals.The company also detailed longer-term plans to grow its shale oil and gas production and green energy as it switches to cleaner resources.The combination of BG catapulted Shell to the world's second biggest international oil company behind Exxon by market capitalisation and production. Shell became the top liquefied natural gas trader and a major deepwater oil producer by increasing its position in Australia and Brazil.Van Beurden hopes the new strategy to generate double digit returns will boost investor confidence and lift Shell's share price which has underperformed rivals since the BG deal was announced in April last year. The deal also doubled its debt-to-equity ratio to 26 percent, leading to credit rating downgrades.""For the first 90 years of Shell's existence... we were the industry leader in total shareholder return. But we lost the lead in the 1990s,"" said the 58-year-old Dutchman, who was appointed in early 2014.""I am determined to get us back to that number one position."" Shell targets a 10 percent return in capital employed by the end of the decade, assuming an oil price of around $60 a barrel, up from around 8 percent between 2013 and 2015. Shell's year-to-date total return was minus 3.2 percent while Exxon shares offered returns of 10 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data.The Anglo-Dutch company has been the only one among the group of 'oil majors' to make a large acquisition in the current downturn, as rivals focused on cutting spending.""With all promises to shareholders maintained and lower forward capex than many thought possible, Shell in their own words is 'creating a world class investment case' which we agree with,"" said analysts at Bernstein, who rate Shell 'outperform'.Shell's shares were up 2.4 pct to 1742 pence by 1342 GMT. EXITS A key element of van Beurden's plan will include narrowing its global activity. Shell said on Tuesday it will exit oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries and sell 10 percent of its production as part of a $30 billion asset sale plan by 2018.The company is active in more than 70 countries but wants to focus on 13 nations, including Brazil, Australia and the United States. It did not say which countries it might exit. Reuters has reported that Shell plans to sell its assets in Gabon. Shell lowered its planned 2016 capex to $29 billion, with exploration set at $2.5 billion, in a third cut from an initial $35 billion. Cost savings will come from 12,500 job cuts in 2015 and this year and overlaps in operations in areas including Australia, Brazil and the North Sea.The company said its medium-term growth priorities were deepwater projects in Brazil and the Gulf of Mexico and its chemicals division, particularly in the United States and China.Deepwater production could double to some 900,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2020.It also gave the go-ahead for investing in a new cracker and polyethylene plant in the United States, one of a handful of investment decisions this year as it grapples with the sharp drop in oil prices over the past two years.Shell will slow new investment in its integrated gas business, which includes LNG, which it said has ""reached critical mass following the BG acquisition"".In the long term, the company said it would target shale oil and gas production in North America and Argentina as well as biofuels, hydrogen, solar and wind in a new energies unit.

773,"   By Denis Pinchuk | MOSCOW  MOSCOW Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) Chief Executive Rex Tillerson is to attend a major investment forum in Russia this week, two industry sources said, ending a two year absence from the event that began when sanctions were imposed on Russia over the crisis in Ukraine.Tillerson is due to attend a session at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum where Igor Sechin, head of Russian state oil firm Rosneft (ROSN.MM), is listed as keynote speaker. Both Rosneft and Sechin are subject to Western sanctions.A spokesman for Exxon Mobil declined to comment on whether Tillerson would be at the June 16-18 forum, which will also be attended by Russian President Vladimir Putin.The annual forum is the marquee event in Russia's business calendar where investors seek the Kremlin's blessing for their projects. In the past few years, the guest list became a barometer of international investor appetite for Russian assets.The number of high-profile Western investors and politicians coming to the event dropped off sharply in 2014, after Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimea Peninsula and backed pro-Moscow separatists in eastern Ukraine.This year, the numbers are recovering. Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi is to attend, along with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker. Western diplomats say businesses are looking to Russia again in anticipation that the sanctions will be dropped or softened within the next year or so. They are also attracted by tentative signs the Russian economy is emerging from its slump.Tillerson's presence is particularly significant because he will be the most high-profile representative of U.S. business at a time when Washington is taking a harder line than Europe on the need to keep sanctions in place.Tillerson is among other oil major chief executives on the forum agenda, including Robert Dudley of BP (BP.L), Claudio Descalzi from ENI (ENI.MI), Schlumberger’s (SLB.N) Paal Kibsgaard and Patrick Pouyanne of Total (TOTF.PA). In 2014 Exxon was forced by the sanctions to suspend its joint operations with Russia's top oil producer Rosneft ROSN.MM in the offshore Arctic Kara sea oil field, where they successfully performed exploration drilling.The sanctions prevent Western companies from giving Russia technology for Arctic offshore, deepwater and shale oil development. After Exxon stepping back, Rosneft has not resumed drilling in the Arctic Kara Sea, citing the sanctions.Exxon has also been involved in a joint oil and gas project with Rosneft, Sakhalin-1, which produces over 100,000 barrels per day of oil. Sakhalin-1 is not subject to the sanctions.

774,"   By Denis Pinchuk | MOSCOW  MOSCOW Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) Chief Executive Rex Tillerson is to attend a major investment forum in Russia this week, two industry sources said, ending a two year absence from the event that began when sanctions were imposed on Russia over the crisis in Ukraine.Tillerson is due to attend a session at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum where Igor Sechin, head of Russian state oil firm Rosneft (ROSN.MM), is listed as keynote speaker. Both Rosneft and Sechin are subject to Western sanctions.A spokesman for Exxon Mobil declined to comment on whether Tillerson would be at the June 16-18 forum, which will also be attended by Russian President Vladimir Putin.The annual forum is the marquee event in Russia's business calendar where investors seek the Kremlin's blessing for their projects. In the past few years, the guest list became a barometer of international investor appetite for Russian assets.The number of high-profile Western investors and politicians coming to the event dropped off sharply in 2014, after Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimea Peninsula and backed pro-Moscow separatists in eastern Ukraine.This year, the numbers are recovering. Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi is to attend, along with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker. Western diplomats say businesses are looking to Russia again in anticipation that the sanctions will be dropped or softened within the next year or so. They are also attracted by tentative signs the Russian economy is emerging from its slump.Tillerson's presence is particularly significant because he will be the most high-profile representative of U.S. business at a time when Washington is taking a harder line than Europe on the need to keep sanctions in place.Tillerson is among other oil major chief executives on the forum agenda, including Robert Dudley of BP (BP.L), Claudio Descalzi from ENI (ENI.MI), Schlumberger’s (SLB.N) Paal Kibsgaard and Patrick Pouyanne of Total (TOTF.PA). In 2014 Exxon was forced by the sanctions to suspend its joint operations with Russia's top oil producer Rosneft ROSN.MM in the offshore Arctic Kara sea oil field, where they successfully performed exploration drilling.The sanctions prevent Western companies from giving Russia technology for Arctic offshore, deepwater and shale oil development. After Exxon stepping back, Rosneft has not resumed drilling in the Arctic Kara Sea, citing the sanctions.Exxon has also been involved in a joint oil and gas project with Rosneft, Sakhalin-1, which produces over 100,000 barrels per day of oil. Sakhalin-1 is not subject to the sanctions. In addition, Exxon and Rosneft are discussing a joint project to build a liquefied natural gas plant in Russia's far east.Tillerson was last in Russia in 2015 for a meeting with Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak. He missed the St Petersburg forum in 2014 and 2015.According to the forum's Internet site, Tillerson attended the event for two consecutive years before the Ukraine crisis.

775,"  (Adds Exxon comment)JAKARTA, June 14 Indonesia has rejected a proposal to increase crude output from the Cepu block operated by U.S. oil and gas giant Exxon Mobil to up to 200,000 barrels per day, the country's upstream oil and gas regulator (SKKMigas) told parliament on Tuesday.SKKMigas disagrees with Exxon's analysis of the potential for the project based on environmental and subsurface considerations, SKKMigas chief Amien Sunaryadi said. Exxon proposed the increase to 200,000 bpd last month noting potential in the project's reservoirs, but said the decision was in the government's hands. An Exxon spokesman declined to comment on the regulator's decision and said the Cepu block was currently producing more than 165,000 bpd. Output from the Banyu Urip project in the Cepu block in East Java province is crucial to Indonesia's long-term efforts to meet rising domestic oil demand as production declines at other ageing fields.(Reporting by Wilda Asmarini; Writing by Fergus Jensen; Editing by Tom Hogue and Manolo Serapio Jr.)",2016-06-14,XOM,"Tue Jun 14, 2016 | 6:28am EDT",UPDATE 1-Indonesia rejects Exxon proposal to boost Cepu block output,http://www.reuters.com//article/indonesia-exxon-mobil-idUSL4N1963AG?type=companyNews

777,"   By Terry Wade | HOUSTON  HOUSTON Exxon Mobil Corp asked a federal court on Wednesday to throw out a subpoena that would force the oil company to hand over decades of documents as part of a wide-ranging inquiry into whether it misled investors about climate change risks.In its filing in a U.S. district court, Exxon said Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey overreached with her April subpoena and that it violated constitutional amendments on free speech, unreasonable search and seizure and equal protection.The Massachusetts attorney general's office said it was reviewing the motion.The move by the world's largest publicly traded oil company is the latest in its high-stakes battle with a coalition of state attorneys general who said in March they would go after Exxon and try to force Congress to tackle climate change.Exxon also pushed back against a raft of shareholder proposals last month asking it to show how it will react to the Paris agreement among 195 governments that aims to limit the rise in global temperatures to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 F) by curbing carbon emissions from fossil fuels. The subpoena from Healey comes amid claims by prosecutors that Exxon executives contradicted papers published by company scientists about the threats of climate change. The subpoena also seeks any Exxon communications with free-market business groups that doubt the efficacy of clamping down on emissions or climate science itself.Exxon said in its filing the subpoena seeks documents outside of the statute of limitations and that activist groups encouraged opening inquiries.""The great irony here is that we've acknowledged the risks of climate change for more than a decade, have supported a carbon tax as the better policy option and spent more than $7 billion on research and technologies to reduce emissions,"" said Exxon spokesman Alan Jeffers. ""It should make people question what this is really all about."" The attorneys general have based their inquiries on whether Exxon's alleged soft-pedaling of climate risks or carbon regulation amounted to securities fraud.In the past, current or former Exxon chief executives have said climate models are not entirely perfect, that curbing emissions could condemn the world's poor to darkness, and that humans may need to adapt to changing weather and rising sea levels. At a seminar in May on climate change law, Columbia Law School professor Merritt B. Fox said Exxon's comments might not be material for investors.That is because investors get information on climate change from many sources and Exxon would probably not be able to alter the ""total mix"" of publicly available information.""The market was well supplied with information about climate change from a variety of sources,"" said Fox, who acknowledged the importance of climate change but expressed skepticism about the legal strategy of prosecutors.On Monday, five Republican congressmen told U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch in a letter the states' inquiries were wrongly treating a policy issue as a law enforcement matter.The case is 4:16-cv-00469-A in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas, Fort Worth division.",2016-06-15,XOM,"Wed Jun 15, 2016 | 3:56pm EDT",Exxon asks U.S. court to throw out subpoena in climate change inquiry,http://www.reuters.com//article/exxon-mobil-climatechange-idUSL1N1971QF?type=companyNews

788,"  ST PETERSBURG, June 17 Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said on Friday that Exxon Mobil's oil and gas project on the Russian Pacific island of Sakhalin may secure rights to export natural gas to China.U.S. energy giant Exxon is an operator of the Sakhalin-1 offshore deposits being jointly developed with Russian state-owned Rosneft under a production-sharing agreement (PSA) formulated in the 1990s.The project's gas deposits have long been locked in due to a price row between Sakhalin-1 and Gazprom, which has a monopoly right to export gas. After meeting Exxon Chief Executive Rex Tillerson on the sidelines of the St Petersburg International Economic Forum, Novak said he had discussed with him three options allowing Sakhalin-1 to sell gas.Those included liquefying the fuel with Rosneft; and to sell it to the nearby Sakhalin-2 - the sole Russian LNG producer, a joint venture of Gazprom, Shell and Japanese partners. ""The third option is gas supplies to China,"" Novak told reporters. He added that the PSA may allow Sakhalin-1 to sell gas abroad despite the Gazprom monopoly. Gazprom has built a pipeline from Sakhalin to the city of Vladivostok near the Chinese border, also aiming to deliver gas via that route.Sakhalin-2 on Thursday called a tender to build a third production train for the Gazprom-Shell LNG plant, which also needs gas from Sakhalin-1 to expand its capacity.

In the court's current term, Alito recused himself in an electricity markets regulation case, likely due to his ownership of shares in auto parts maker Johnson Controls Inc, which was involved in the dispute. Alito also stepped aside in a Puerto Rico debt-restructuring law case because of his investments in funds with assets in Puerto Rico municipal bonds.The bronze Douglass bust, estimated to be worth $6,500, was given to Thomas by businessman Harlan Crow, a contributor to conservative causes and a friend of the justice.Justice Elena Kagan also received an expensive gift: a signed copy of a book by one of her predecessors on the court, Justice Felix Frankfurter, who died in 1965.

798,"   By Alex Dobuzinskis | LOS ANGELES  LOS ANGELES An oil spill of 700 barrels of crude spilled from a pipeline near California's coast on Thursday but was quickly contained in a dry creek bed and did not reach the Pacific Ocean in Ventura County, officials said.The Ventura County Fire Department had initially estimated the size of the leak from the Crimson Pipeline at 5,000 barrels, but later said a much smaller amount was released in a stain stretching a half-mile.The line was shut shortly after the discovery of the spill, which was a tiny fraction of an infamous offshore blowout in 1969 that spewed up to 100,000 barrels into the ocean and halted new drilling in California by galvanizing environmentalists.Thursday's leak occurred near Ventura, California, a beachside community less than 60 miles (97 km) northwest of Los Angeles.  The pipeline supplies crude to Tesoro Corp's 257,300 barrel per day (bpd) Los Angeles refinery, but was not expected to impact the refiner's ability to supply its customers, a representative for the refiner said on Thursday. Like other California refiners, it relies heavily on crude tankers arriving by sea.Crimson took responsibility for the spill but did not say whose crude it was transporting. Spotters stationed along the coastline, which is about a mile from the site of the leak, said no oil had reached the ocean, Doug Allen, a supervising pipeline safety engineer for the state, said in a phone interview.Crews created an earth-filled dam about a quarter mile from the site of the leak to capture the oil, Allen said.""It seems like they stopped it,"" said Allen, who is with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, which has jurisdiction over the pipeline.     The oil leaked into the Prince Barranca, a gorge, and by mid-morning had been contained, the Ventura County Fire Department said. The spill comes less than a year after a pipeline owned by Plains All American Pipeline ruptured in Santa Barbara County, just northwest of Ventura County, sending up to 2,500 barrels of crude gushing onto the shore and into the Pacific Ocean.Plains was indicted on 46 criminal charges as a result of the spill, including four felonies for knowingly discharging a pollutant into state waters. If convicted, the company could face penalties of between $1 million and $2.8 million. Thursday's spill is not expected to impact supplies to Southern California refineries, which each day normally process more than 1 million barrels.Refiners in California receive large volumes of Alaskan crude and foreign oil at ports in Los Angeles, Long Beach and San Francisco Bay, in addition to volumes received by pipelines.Public agencies, including the Department of Fish and Wildlife, the Office of Spill Prevention and Response, Ventura County Office of Emergency Services (OES), the U.S. Coast Guard, State Parks, and local government all responded to the incident, reported around 5:30 a.m. local time.The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) said it had sent investigators to provide assistance to the California state fire marshal, who is responsible for the investigation of the spill to determine the cause.

806,"  * July 1 deadline for Norway's oil wage talks* Fields produce 17-18 pct of Norway's output -Reuters calculation* Further escalation likely unless deal found   (Updates ExxonMobil's comment)By Stine Jacobsen and Terje SolsvikOSLO, June 27 About 755 Norwegian workers on seven oil and gas fields could go on strike from Saturday, hitting output from western Europe's top producer, if a new wage deal is not agreed before a Friday deadline, trade unions said on Monday.A final round of mandatory talks will be hosted by a state mediator on June 30 and July 1 in an effort to avoid disruption that could start the following day.The affected fields account for nearly 18 percent of Norway's oil output and a little more than 17 percent of its natural gas, Reuters calculations show. Combined oil output was about 285,000 barrels per day in the first four months of the year, with natural gas output at 48.5 million cubic metres (mcm) per day.Norway currently produces about 1.6 million barrels of crude and 280 million standard cubic metres of natural gas per day. Its combined natural gas liquids (NGL) and condensate output is about 400,000 barrels.Employers have argued that a plunge in oil prices since 2014 must be accompanied by cost cuts and flexible work practices to help to keep the industry competitive.Unions, meanwhile, say that members should receive pay increases matching those in other industries. The Industri Energi union said it would take out 524 members if the talks break down, affecting the Statoil-operated  Oseberg, Gullfaks and Kvitebjoern fields.The SAFE union said it would take out 156 workers on ExxonMobil's Balder, Jotun and Ringhorne fields.In addition, 75 workers on Engie's Gjoea field would also go on strike, the smaller Lederne union said. Engie said it would shut Gjoea in the event of a strike, while ExxonMobil said a strike would affect its operations.Statoil declined to comment.A protracted conflict could ultimately result in more than 7,400 workers going on strike, data from the state mediator's office showed.""We do, of course, wish for mediation to lead to a deal, so that conflict is avoided,"" SAFE said in a statement.The three labour unions will negotiate on behalf of the oil workers, while Norwegian Oil and Gas (NOG) will represent the companies.In 2012 a 16-day strike among some of Norway's oil workers cut the country's output of crude by about 13 percent and its natural gas production by about 4 percent.

InterOil said Oil Search had allowed the company to proceed with the negotiations.InterOil is an attractive takeover target for companies looking to tap the potential of Papua New Guinea's liquefied natural gas (LNG) reserves as it has 36.5 percent stake in a project in the Elk-Antelope fields. Total SA (TOTF.PA), Oil Search and the Papua New Guinea government are the company's partners in the project. ExxonMobil Corp (XOM.N) is another oil and gas major with an LNG project in the country, considered a good location due to its high-quality gas and low costs.Elk-Antelope fields could hold at least 6.2 trillion cubic feet of gas, more than enough to fill one LNG processing train. In May, InterOil agreed to be acquired by Oil Search in a $2.2 billion deal. InterOil Chief Executive Michael Hesson had said then that the company had received a number of other proposals, but he had declined to give details.InterOil said on Thursday that its board continued to unanimously support the Oil Search transaction. A special shareholder meeting to discuss the deal is scheduled for July 28. InterOil shares rose 4.6 percent to $44 in light premarket trading.

However, operational upsets, including a crane accident less than two weeks before the acquisition was set to close, led to fears that the deal would be delayed.The sale was announced seven months after a February 2015 blast at the gasoline-producing fluid catalytic cracking unit (FCCU) at the plant. As a closing requirement, Exxon was required to demonstrate the refinery was fully functional for at least 15 days.  In early April, Exxon reached an agreement with state regulators to restart the crippled unit, which provides about 10 percent of the state's gasoline supply and had been offline since the explosion. In an earlier quarterly earnings call, PBF had said it expected the unit would restart by mid-March.

818,"  HOUSTON, July 1 Alaskan North Slope (ANS) crude will be shipped to Nicaragua for the first time in July, two trade sources said on Friday, underscoring a shift in oil flows to and from the U.S. West Coast.A parcel of the medium grade crude is on its way to the Pacific Area Lightering (PAL) near southern California on Exxon Mobil Corp's Liberty Bay, a U.S. flagged vessel, according to the sources and Reuters vessel tracking data.From there, it will transfer to the Liberian-flagged Panamax tanker Chantal for delivery to Nicaragua, where Swiss commodities trader Trafigura Trading LLC will take the crude, said the sources who were not authorized to speak to the media about the matter. Representatives for Trafigura and Exxon declined to comment.Global crude flows have changed in the last six months as oversupplied markets force producers to compete aggressively on price. The United States in December lifted a four-decade ban on exporting crude, giving global refiners access to a wider variety of crude. ANS, which was exempted from the U.S. export ban, is almost exclusively sold to West Coast refiners and transported on U.S. flagged vessels owned by BP Plc, Exxon and ConocoPhillips  that comply with maritime law. The rare cargoes that have moved abroad in recent years have gone to South Korea or Japan. Trafigura has a stake in Puma Energy, which operates a small refinery in Managua, Nicaragua, and manages downstream assets in 47 countries.In March, Trafigura took 380,000 barrels of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude at its Puma refinery in Nicaragua.

819,"   By Dmitry Zhdannikov | LONDON  LONDON U.S. oil major Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) and Britain's BP (BP.L) are at loggerheads over a giant oil production deal with Azerbaijan, blocking renewal of what was once called ""the contract of the century"", three high-level industry sources told Reuters.BP, which operates the Azeri-Chigar-Guneshli (ACG) fields in the Caspian Sea and relies on them for a tenth of its global output, has tentatively agreed terms with the Azeri government on extending the 30-year contract, they said. But Exxon, which gets around one percent of its hydrocarbon production through its stake in the ACG consortium, has been holding out for a better deal since the halving of world oil prices in 2014.The result is deadlock in talks over a project that may produce another $100 billion worth of oil at current prices, coming on top of old tensions between Exxon chief executive Rex Tillerson and his BP counterpart Bob Dudley, the sources said. ""There have been numerous attempts to find a breakthrough, with BP and Azerbaijan agreeing new terms but Exxon rejecting them time and time again. It has been going on for almost two years, with Exxon insisting on better terms,"" a Western oil industry source familiar with discussions said.A high-level source in the former Soviet republic said: ""Exxon wants better terms. It has its own views of how the consortium should work which are different from the views of the operator BP."" Neither source would go into details of the terms under discussion.While the existing deal still has eight years to run, usual energy industry practice is to try to renew such long-term production sharing agreements as early as possible - preferably around a decade before they are due to expire - to plan huge new investments in advance. So far the consortium partners have invested $32 billion in the project.At stake is three quarters of overall Azeri crude output or about 600,000 barrels per day - equal to 0.7 percent of global output - extracted under the agreement between the ACG consortium members and the Azeri government.Azerbaijan signed the original deal in 1994, only three years after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Since then, energy wealth has transformed what had been an impoverished nation into one confident enough to host a Formula One Grand Prix a fortnight ago, although the oil price crash has badly hurt its economy.For Europe, the country is a vital source of oil and gas as the continent tries to lessen its dependence on Russian energy. BP declined to comment on details of the extension talks, saying the ACG fields had already produced over 2.9 billion barrels since 1994. That would be worth $155 billion, using an average price of $55 per barrel for the past two decades.""Together with our co-venturers in Azerbaijan, we remain committed to building on this record of success and supporting the continued development of the local market,"" BP said.Exxon said it does not comment on ""commercial negotiations"".TENSE RELATIONS  While BP has a 35.8 percent stake in the project, Exxon holds only 8 percent. Other members include Azeri state oil firm Socar and U.S. major Chevron with over 11 percent each, Inpex of Japan with 11 percent and Norway's Statoil with 8.6 percent. Turkey's TPAO, Japan's Itochu and India's ONGC have smaller stakes.The ACG consortium has had problems in the past.The fields had been expected to pump more than 1 million bpd at their peak but after hitting 820,000 bpd in 2010, output has fallen, prompting Azeri President Ilham Aliyev to accuse BP of making ""false promises"".Azerbaijan even suggested it may develop the fields on its own after the deal expires in 2024.But BP managed to mend fences and opened talks on extending the agreement until 2040 and possibly 2060. The aim is to extract as much as 2 billion barrels of additional oil, worth another $100 billion at today's prices of $50 per barrel.However, oil companies around the world have been reviewing production contracts to slash costs and limit spending during the worst downturn in global prices in at least three decades. Exxon's position began to toughen after 2014, and one source close to the discussions said the Tillerson-Dudley relationship had complicated matters. ""It could have been sorted out at the very top level. But Rex and Bob have had frosty relations for years,"" the source said.Sources pointed to several events over the past years which had soured matters between the two Americans.After BP's deadly 2010 Gulf of Mexico disaster, Dudley said it was ""one-in-a-million occurrence"" and that BP did not act in a negligent manner. Tillerson, however, called the biggest oil spill in U.S. history ""a breakdown of management oversight"" and called Dudley's remarks ""a great disservice to the industry"".A year later, BP lost a deal to drill for oil in the Russian Arctic after a surprise decision by its long-time local partner Rosneft to chose Exxon.Then last year, BP was among a group of top oil firms that made a rare joint appeal in support of the United Nations-backed Paris climate deal. Tillerson refused to sign, saying he didn't want to be ""disingenuous"" or ""fake it"" as far as his long-standing scepticism on the issue was concerned.In contrast to the ACG deal, a BP-led consortium which operates the giant Shakh Deniz gas field nearby agreed new terms with the Azeri government extending the agreement to 2036. Exxon is not involved in that consortium.It is not unusual for host countries to use disagreements between consortium partners to extract better terms, under the threat of refusing to renew deals.But the Azeri source played down this possibility. ""Azerbaijan is not giving any ultimatums. We are still hoping for a deal before the end of September,"" the source said.

821,"   By Raushan Nurshayeva | ASTANA  ASTANA Kazakhstan and a group of oil companies led by Chevron (CVX.N) have approved a $36.8 billion plan to boost production at the Central Asian country's Tengiz field, a rare major investment in an industry hit by low prices and a boost to the local economy. The field, one of the world's biggest, already accounts for more than a third of total crude output in Kazakhstan, which is the biggest former Soviet oil producer after Russia.Under the plan, Tengiz, in which Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) and Lukoil (LKOH.MM) also have stakes, will increase output to 39 million tonnes a year (850,000 barrels per day) by 2022 from 27 million tonnes currently, Kazakhstan's Energy Ministry and its foreign partners said in a joint statement on Tuesday.The Tengiz expansion is the biggest final investment decision in the oil industry this year and one of just three major projects in recent years, two others being Statoil’s Johan Sverdrup and Shell’s Appomatox.The move comes at a time when energy companies are tightening their belts due to low oil prices. At its peak, Tengiz output will be roughly the same as the current oil production of Britain.""Today we are witnessing a historic event not just for the oil and gas sector but for the whole country,"" Kazakh Energy Minister Kanat Bozumbayev told reporters in Astana, sitting next to executives of Tengizchevroil, the joint venture operating Tengiz, and partner companies. Bozumbayev said the expansion would generate about $120 billion in extra tax payments by 2033 when the Tengiz contract expires.In a separate statement, Chevron said the total project budget included $27.1 billion for facilities, $3.5 billion for wells and $6.2 billion for contingency and escalation.Tengizchevroil General Director Ted Etchison said the project would be financed by a combination of own funds, contributions from partners and borrowings. He did not provide any details. Tengizchevroil sent final documents to banks for a $3 billion five- to seven-year loan agreement last week.Kazakhstan holds a 20 percent stake in the venture via state oil and gas firm KazMunayGaz KMGZ.KZ. Chevron owns 50 percent, Exxon Mobil has 25 percent and Lukarco, controlled by Russia's LUKOIL, the remaining 5 percent.Oil is Kazakhstan's main export and the nation of 18 million has tripled output since gaining independence in 1991, although production has edged down in the last few years due to a natural decline at some mature fields. Tengiz's development contrasts with another giant Kazakh project, Kashagan, whose launch has been postponed by many years and which is due to start pumping in the fourth quarter of 2016.Kashagan's multiple technical problems - such as pipelines that leaked toxic gas - have slowed Kazakhstan's ambitious strategy to boost output to 130 million tonnes a year (3 million barrels per day) and become one of the world's top 10 producers.The Astana government had initially planned to achieve that target by last year but has now pushed it back to 2020.

822,"   By John Kemp | LONDON  LONDON “How much oil lies beneath the desert sands of Saudi Arabia and how long will it last before running out?” is a question that has intrigued and confounded oil experts for five decades.The kingdom has proven reserves of 266 billion barrels according to government estimates submitted to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (“Annual Statistical Bulletin”, OPEC, 2015).If these numbers are correct, Saudi Arabia’s reserves will last for another 70 years at the average production rate of 10.2 million barrels per day reported for 2015.But there is widespread scepticism about the official estimates, which were abruptly raised without explanation from 170 billion barrels in 1987 to 260 billion in 1989 (tmsnrt.rs/29fzTm3).Official reserves have remained constant every year since then at 260-265 billion barrels, even as the country has consumed or exported another 94 billion barrels (“Statistical Review of World Energy”, BP, 2016).If the government data is accurate, the kingdom has managed the remarkable feat of exactly replacing each produced barrel with new discoveries or increased estimates of the amount recoverable from existing fields.But most of the country’s giant and super-giant oil fields were discovered between 1936 and 1970 and no comparable discoveries have been made since then.The implied increase in reserves must therefore come from enhanced estimates of the amount of oil recoverable from existing reservoirs.The problem is that field-by-field production profiles and reserve estimates are state secrets known by only a small group of insiders, making it impossible to test or verify them.Analyzing Saudi reserves and trying to predict when the kingdom’s production will begin to decline has been a graveyard for the reputation of professional oil analysts.The kingdom is currently producing more oil than ever before, defying predictions that its output would peak and then fall (“Twilight in the desert”, Simmons, 2005).RESERVE ESTIMATES The oil industry employs a number of different ways of classifying the amount of oil available for future production.The broadest category is the total amount of original oil in place (OOIP) in the reservoir formation before production began.In the 1970s, there was broad agreement that the OOIP of Saudi Arabia’s discovered oil fields was around 530 billion barrels.The estimate for original oil in place was reported to the U.S. Senate’s Subcommittee on International Economic Policy by executives for Arabian-American Oil Company (Aramco).Aramco was then jointly owned by four U.S. oil companies (Exxon, Texaco, Socal and Mobil) as well as the government of Saudi Arabia so its owners and executives could be required to testify.The subcommittee report, now nearly 40 years old, contains some of the last detailed information about Saudi reserves in the public domain (“The future of Saudi Arabian oil production”, U.S. Senate, 1979).But not all of the original oil in place can be produced technically or profitably so most analysts focus on a series of narrower measures which look at the amount of technically and economically recoverable reserves. Proved reserves, the most conservative and prudent measure, are those which are estimated to exist, and are technically and economically recoverable, with a probability of at least 90 percent.Probable reserves are those estimated to exist and be commercially recoverable with a probability of at least 50 percent.Possible reserves, the most speculative and optimistic measure, are estimated to exist and be commercially recoverable with a probability of at least 10 percent.In the late 1970s, Aramco put proven reserves at around 110 billion barrels, while the more speculative categories of probable and possible reserves were put at 178 billion barrels and 248 billion barrels respectively.The question of which measure to use for production and planning purposes is a matter of judgment and caused controversy between the Aramco partners and the Saudi government in the 1970s.PROVED OR PROBABLE? Since 1980, the Saudi government has been the sole owner of Aramco. From 1982, detailed field-by-field information about the company’s reserves and production has been restricted.Saudi Arabia began reporting to OPEC that its “proved” reserves stood at around 168-170 billion barrels of crude oil.The Saudi figure was much higher than the 110 billion barrels of proved reserves reported by the Aramco partners a few years before. But it was very close to the figure for possible reserves that the Aramco partners had reported to the U.S. Senate.That raised the question if the Saudis had chosen to increase their reported reserve base by reporting probable reserves as proved reserves.In 1988/89, the proved reserve figure jumped again to 260 billion barrels despite no major new discoveries. (tmsnrt.rs/29fzTm3).This was much higher than the proved figure reported by the Aramco partners but not far off the figure of 248 billion for possible reserves they had reported in the 1970s.Again that posed the question whether the Saudis were reporting possible reserves as proved to increase the size of their reserve base.The Society of Petroleum Engineers and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission have strict definitions for estimating and reporting reserves (“Guidelines for Application of the Petroleum Resources Management System”, SPE, 2011).But it is far from clear that the “proven” reserves which Saudi Aramco has reported to OPEC employ the same definitions; because the calculations are secret outsiders have no way of verifying them.RESERVE GROWTH It is not uncommon for countries to produce far more oil than initial reserve estimates suggested would be possible. Reserve increases can come from the discovery of new oil and gas deposits or from an increase in the estimated amount of oil that is commercially recoverable from an existing field.Reserve growth from existing fields, also known as field appreciation, is one of the most important sources of increases in oil reserves in most countries.As understanding of the reservoir increases, more information is known about its extent, and new technology and techniques become available, the amount of technically recoverable oil may rise (“Reserve growth of oil and gas fields”, United States Geological Survey, 2013).Because the calculation of reserves is deliberately conservative, it is fairly common for reserves initially reported as “possible” to become “probable” and eventually “proved”.But Saudi Arabia seems to have been unusually reliant on reserve growth within existing fields to revise its reserves up to 265 billion barrels and keep them there since the late 1980s.SELLING ARAMCO Saudi leaders have announced plans to seek a stock market listing for Saudi Aramco and make up to five percent of the company’s shares available to investors.The prospect of a partial floatation has triggered renewed interest in Aramco’s reserves since they could be an important part of any valuation.If Saudi Aramco was required to comply with the normal listing rules it would have to make much more information available about its reserves and how they are calculated.But there are reasons to be cautious about expecting much more transparency: it is far from clear that any share sale would include ownership of the reserves in the ground.In the meantime, no one really knows how much more oil can be recovered from beneath the Saudi desert and adjoining areas in the Gulf.Rystad Energy, a respected consultancy, puts Saudi Arabia’s proved reserves at 70 billion barrels, and its proved and probable reserves at 120 billion barrels.If new field discoveries are included the reserve figure could grow to somewhere between 168 billion and 212 billion barrels (“United States now holds more oil reserves than Saudi Arabia”, Rystad, 2016).All these figures are substantially below the official numbers for proved reserves, though at the upper end the gap is relatively narrow.The implication is that Saudi Arabia is relying on reserve growth from the reclassification of possible reserves and fresh discoveries to maintain its proved reserves at the same level since the 1980s.

827,"   By Mike Stone  Exxon Mobil Corp has tabled an offer to buy InterOil Corp topping the $2.2 billion deal from Australia's Oil Search Ltd, according to people familiar with the matter.In May, InterOil agreed to be acquired by Oil Search but on 30 June, InterOil acknowledged it received another non-binding offer even as global markets roiled in the wake of Britain's exit from the European Union. Exxon's interest, which has not yet been made public by either company, is comprised of Exxon stock, as well as a Contingent Value Right (CVR), a seldom used instrument, which may give InterOil shareholders cash on a sliding scale depending on the value of a pending gas deposit discovery, the people said. This is the same structure as the Oil Search bid, though Exxon's bid is higher, the people said.  InterOil and Oil Search declined to comment. Exxon did not respond to a request for comment. The people asked not to be named because the talks were private. InterOil, which trades on the New York Stock exchange, is an attractive takeover target for companies looking to tap the potential of Papua New Guinea's liquefied natural gas (LNG) reserves as it has a 36.5 percent stake in a project in the Elk-Antelope fields.Papua New Guinea's Elk-Antelope fields could hold at least 6.2 trillion cubic feet of gas, more than enough to fill one LNG processing train. France's Total SA, Oil Search and the Papua New Guinea government are partners in the project. Exxon also has an LNG project in the country, considered a good location due to its high-quality gas and low costs. InterOil's merger contract with Oil Search allows for negotiations with a rival bidder to proceed if certain conditions were met, the companies said in its 30 June announcement of a conditional, non-binding bid from an unnamed party. According to a presentation filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday, InterOil received three proposals, including Oil Search's, to sell the entire company during its initial sale process.

828,"   By Mike Stone  Exxon Mobil Corp has tabled an offer to buy InterOil Corp topping the $2.2 billion deal from Australia's Oil Search Ltd, according to people familiar with the matter.In May, InterOil agreed to be acquired by Oil Search but on 30 June, InterOil acknowledged it received another non-binding offer even as global markets roiled in the wake of Britain's exit from the European Union. Exxon's interest, which has not yet been made public by either company, is comprised of Exxon stock, as well as a Contingent Value Right (CVR), a seldom used instrument, which may give InterOil shareholders cash on a sliding scale depending on the value of a pending gas deposit discovery, the people said. This is the same structure as the Oil Search bid, though Exxon's bid is higher, the people said.  InterOil and Oil Search declined to comment. Exxon did not respond to a request for comment. The people asked not to be named because the talks were private. InterOil, which trades on the New York Stock exchange, is an attractive takeover target for companies looking to tap the potential of Papua New Guinea's liquefied natural gas (LNG) reserves as it has a 36.5 percent stake in a project in the Elk-Antelope fields.Papua New Guinea's Elk-Antelope fields could hold at least 6.2 trillion cubic feet of gas, more than enough to fill one LNG processing train. France's Total SA, Oil Search and the Papua New Guinea government are partners in the project. Exxon also has an LNG project in the country, considered a good location due to its high-quality gas and low costs. InterOil's merger contract with Oil Search allows for negotiations with a rival bidder to proceed if certain conditions were met, the companies said in its 30 June announcement of a conditional, non-binding bid from an unnamed party. According to a presentation filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday, InterOil received three proposals, including Oil Search's, to sell the entire company during its initial sale process. InterOil has scheduled a special shareholder meeting to vote on the Oil Search deal on July 28.Since the deal's announcement, InterOil's merger with Oil Search has hit other bumps.

829,"   By Barani Krishnan | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Oil prices surged 5 percent on Tuesday, the biggest daily gain since April, as investors' covering of short positions and a technical rebound helped lift the market from two-month lows.However, crude futures pared gains in post-settlement trade after industry group American Petroleum Institute (API) reported a surprise build of 2.2 million barrels in U.S. crude stockpiles last week. During the regular trading session, a rally in global equity markets to record highs added to the upbeat sentiment in oil. The dollar fell, making greenback-denominated oil more attractive to holders of the euro and other currencies. [MKTS/GLOB] [.N] [USD/]    API also reported larger-than-expected gains in inventories of gasoline and distillates, which include diesel. A Reuters poll had forecast a crude drawdown of 3 million barrels last week, translating to an eighth straight week of declines. Official inventory data is due from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) on Wednesday. [EIA/S]""It's another major curveball from the API in terms of expectations,"" said John Kildulff, partner at New York energy hedge fund Again Capital, referring to huge variances at times between the trade group's numbers and the government's. ""We'll just have to hunker down and wait for the EIA report.""U.S. crude's West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures settled up $2.04, or 4.6 percent, at $46.80 a barrel. Brent crude futures settled up $2.22, or 4.8 percent, at $48.47. After the API report, both benchmarks trimmed gains to less than $2 a barrel.The robust rally in regular trading was the biggest in oil since April 8. It  propelled the market from Monday's two-month lows when Brent tumbled to $45.90 and WTI $44.42.""The market's gotten really short over the past two weeks with everyone focused on weaker fundamentals and now you're seeing sudden covering,"" said Scott Shelton, energy futures broker with ICAP in Durham, North Carolina. Oil came under selling pressure after the last EIA weekly report contained U.S. crude and gasoline inventory numbers that signaled weak demand. A higher count for U.S. oil drilling rigs and fewer bullish bets by hedge funds had also weighed on the market. [RIG/U]In Tuesday's early trade, oil was supported by producer group OPEC's optimism that the market was likely to achieve balance in supply-demand by next year. Also aiding sentiment was a separate EIA report showing higher estimates for U.S. oil demand growth in 2017.

841,"  (Repeats item issued earlier. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.)By Clyde RussellLAUNCESTON, Australia, July 19 ExxonMobil Corp's bid to buy a junior natural gas explorer in a remote Pacific country shows that rare corporate ability of planning a deal at the bottom of the commodity cycle that holds the promise of long-term returns.ExxonMobil has offered at least $2.2 billion for InterOil Corp in order to obtain the smaller company's natural gas assets in Papua New Guinea.In doing so, the world's biggest listed oil company has trumped an offer from Australia's Oil Search, which was backed by French major Total.At first blush the logic for the deal may seem somewhat lacking, given the sole use of InterOil's gas fields would be to supply a liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant, and the last thing needed in the current market is more of the super-chilled fuel.Asian spot LNG prices LNG-AS ended last week at $5.75 per million British thermal units (mmBtu). While this is higher than the record low of $4 hit in April, it's still only about a quarter of the all-time high of $20.50 reached in February 2014.The outlook for LNG prices is also constrained for the foreseeable future, as the market will have to absorb a surge in supply from eight new projects in Australia, five in the United States and the potential for more from new provinces such as East Africa.So why would ExxonMobil bother buying InterOil's stake in gas fields in Papua New Guinea, especially when the Texas company already operates an existing LNG plant in the country?It's that existing plant that holds the key, as the best option for ExxonMobil to expand its 6.9-million tonne a year capacity is to acquire sufficient reserves to justify building another liquefaction train.InterOil's Elk-Antelope gas field holds at least 6.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, and further drilling should expand this reserve. It is also high-quality gas and the cost of doing business in Papua New Guinea is less than in neighbouring Australia.This means ExxonMobil's bid, if successful, could underwrite the expansion of its PNG LNG project on a timescale that may see it deliver its first cargoes just as the surplus of LNG is expected to disappear in the mid-2020s.InterOil's board has switched to backing ExxonMobil's offer over the rival bid from Oil Search, although the Australian company has the chance to trump the counter offer.It's unlikely that Oil Search will try to do so, because even losing out to ExxonMobil could see it emerge as a winner anyway.This is because Oil Search is already a 29 percent stakeholder in the ExxonMobil-operated PNG LNG project, a share not too far behind the U.S. giant's 33.2 percent. Any deal that boosts the prospects for PNG LNG will also be good for Oil Search.In addition, the Australian company holds a 22.8 percent stake in the Elk-Antelope gas field, the target of ExxonMobil's InterOil bid.If ExxonMobil succeeds in acquiring InterOil, Oil Search effectively becomes the junior partner in both the existing LNG plant and any potential expansion using the Elk-Antelope resources.TOTAL WILD CARD  The big question for both ExxonMobil and Oil Search is what will Total do.The French company owns a 40.1 percent stake in Elk-Antelope and is the operator, with InterOil the next biggest holder at 36.5 percent.Total has outlined plans to build its own LNG project in Papua New Guinea, something that may prove impossible if ExxonMobil and Oil Search believe their interests lie with expanding the existing facility.It's worth bearing in mind that even with Papua New Guinea's superior cost structure, a new LNG plant would struggle to be viable in the current environment of low prices.It's possible that all parties could end up working together, but it may be more practical to find a way to buy out Total's position in Elk-Antelope.The attitude of the PNG government will also be important, as it will have to be convinced that a brownfield expansion of the existing LNG plant is a better long-term bet than trying to build a second, greenfield operation.As can be seen, there are many loose ends still to tie up, but ExxonMobil appears to be making a strong bid for quality assets with its eyes firmly on the long term.If it all works out, this could be a great example of a resource company doing what commentators always say they should be doing, namely buying good assets at the bottom of the market and seeking ways to exploit them in a cost-effective manner.Resource companies have correctly copped criticism when they do expensive acquisitions at the top of the commodity cycle, so they deserve kudos when they buy when the market looks bleak.(Editing by Richard Pullin)",2016-07-19,XOM,"Tue Jul 19, 2016 | 8:00am EDT",RPT-COLUMN-ExxonMobil's offer for InterOil a model for buying at the bottom: Russell,http://www.reuters.com//article/column-russell-lng-exxon-mobil-idUSL4N1A51VY?type=companyNews

849,"  * ExxonMobil repairing leak on pipeline several miles offshore* Repairs needed more extensive than initially thought - sources* Exxon declines to comment on any leak, timeline for repairs   (Adds export information, militant claims)By Libby GeorgeLONDON, July 21 Exports of Nigeria's largest crude oil stream, Qua Iboe, will remain under force majeure for at least one month while operator ExxonMobil repairs a leak on the pipeline feeding the terminal, sources told Reuters.The damage is the latest setback to Nigerian oil production, which has been hobbled this spring by militant attacks and another accident at the Qua Iboe terminal earlier this year.Exxon declared force majeure last week, citing a ""system anomaly"" it observed during a routine check. Sources told Reuters this week that the pipeline lost pressure while loading a cargo of crude oil and that the company subsequently discovered a leak on the underwater pipeline. An Exxon spokesman declined to comment on any leak or a timeline for repairs.Sources said that repairs needed to fix the leak, which was on part of the pipeline several miles offshore, were more extensive than initially thought and would not begin this week. The force majeure is likely to remain in place for a minimum of one month, several sources said.Two of Nigeria's largest fields are now under force majeure, with Shell-operated Forcados crude oil exports halted since a militant attack on its subsea pipeline in February. While Exxon said at the time it declared force majeure that the terminal was operating, traders said the company had not yet released a revised loading schedule for July crude exports, an ominous sign for those hoping to purchase or sell the oil.According to Reuters vessel tracking, the last ship to load crude at the Qua Iboe terminal was the Ottoman Nobility on July 9. Typically, a vessel would load a million-barrel lot of Qua every three to four days, and exports of 250,000 bpd aboard eight vessels were scheduled for July.Three other ships scheduled to load Qua were near the terminal, one since July 12. The cause of the leak is unclear, but the force majeure came just days after militant group the Niger Delta Avengers claimed to have bombed a pipeline related to Qua Iboe.Exxon denied at the time that there had been any attack, and said the force majeure was unrelated to any militant activity. However, the scale of the damage has raised questions among traders.The Avengers warned that if the company moved forward with  repairs ""something big...will happen"".(Reporting By Libby George and Julia Payne; Editing by Alexandra Hudson and David Goodman)",2016-07-21,XOM,"Thu Jul 21, 2016 | 12:22pm EDT",UPDATE 2-Nigeria's Qua Iboe crude under force majeure for at least a month -sources,http://www.reuters.com//article/nigeria-oil-exports-idUSL8N1A75WA?type=companyNews

852,"   By Sonali Paul, Oleg Vukmanovic  and Ron Bousso | MELBOURNE/MILAN/LONDON -  MELBOURNE/MILAN/LONDON - Forced to shut its $54 billion Gorgon liquefied natural gas (LNG) export plant twice in its first five months, Chevron Corp now faces calls from union officials for a probe into the site's safety.Chevron denies there have been any safety breaches at the plant but is under pressure to resolve problems that have limited exports to just two cargoes since starting operations in March.The Australian Manufacturing Workers' Union (AMWU) has told Reuters it has formally requested access to the site.""The AMWU has concerns about safety at Gorgon,"" Steve McCartney, West Australian secretary of the AMWU, told Reuters via email. A failed weld on a valve casing called a trunnion caused the gas leak that forced the plant to close on July 1, he said. ""The AMWU wants to know why it failed, and what checks were carried out to ensure it met Australian standards,"" McCartney said. Chevron called the leak ""minor"", although it did evacuate some workers. On Wednesday the company said it expected to resume production shortly.""Chevron Australia is in discussions with the AMWU to visit the site as part of usual union engagement with its members,"" a spokeswoman said, adding that there had been no safety breaches at the plant.Reuters could not independently confirm whether the issues at the plant pose any risk to worker safety. MISTAKES  Chevron, which is counting on Gorgon to help it become an LNG leader in Asia, reported its first shutdown in April and was forced to shut again following a gas leak on July 1.In interviews with Reuters, site workers and industry sources familiar with operations at Gorgon said mistakes led to the first shutdown.According to information provided by one engineer at the plant, liquid propane in the refrigerant circuit flooded into a section of pipeline meant to handle gases only.Metal debris inside the piping was propelled along at speed, damaging equipment and producing ""very loud clunking noises"" which prompted operators to initiate emergency shutdown procedures, according to one worker and corroborated by AMWU's McCartney.Chevron said the problem occurred in the propane refrigerant circuit where natural gas is cooled into a liquid but declined to provide further details.  LAGGING RIVALS The shutdowns have cost Gorgon more than $200 million in lost output, excluding repairs and other expenditures, one industry consultant estimated, basing the figure on an export schedule of around one cargo per week.The outages have also contributed to a jump in global LNG spot prices, which are up by around 40 percent since April. [LNG-AS]Two industry sources said Chevron ignored advice from project partners Royal Dutch Shell and Exxon Mobil to go slow with the launch of Gorgon.""We do not comment on industry rumor or speculation,"" Chevron said. Royal Dutch Shell and Exxon also declined to comment. ""Gorgon's teething issues mirror the ongoing problems at Angola LNG and put the spotlight on Chevron,"" said Rystad Energy analyst Readul Islam regarding Chevron's ability to deliver LNG plants.  Chevron and partners BP, ENI and Total has just finished work on its LNG plant in Angola following a two-year shutdown to fix design flaws. Operations tentatively resumed at the plant just last month.Meanwhile, rivals have moved forward, with Exxon Mobil launching its Papua New Guinea (PNG LNG) liquefaction plant on time and on budget in 2014, when Gorgon was first due to start operations. ""The relatively niggle-free ramp-up of Gladstone LNG (in Australia) as well as the PNG LNG trains over the past two years could lead to questions being asked of Gorgon's onshore (start-up) team,"" said Rystad's Islam, but he added that Gorgon's greater complexity and size arguably make it a bigger challenge.Industry sources and analysts continue to project start-up delays at subsequent phases of Gorgon due partly to the latest hiatus.Chevron denies this. It says that construction on Gorgon production lines two and three, which will boost its export capacity to 15.6 million tonnes a year in 2017, are unaffected.Peter Coleman, chief executive of Woodside Petroleum which is partnered with Chevron in developing the $33 billion Wheatstone LNG project in Australia, said his company was taking a more hands-on role in development as Chevron is ""having to direct resources elsewhere"".But he added he had no concerns about Chevron as a project operator.""They've got a lot on their plate and so many hands help, and that's where we are at the moment,"" he said.

853,"  MELBOURNE Australia's Oil Search Ltd has cleared the way for ExxonMobil Corp to take over InterOil Corp for $2.2 billion, giving the U.S. giant access to a rich new gas field to expand its exports from Papua New Guinea.The move could lead ExxonMobil and French giant Total SA to tie together their competing gas interests in the South Pacific nation, cooperating to reduce costs as they battle cheap oil and liquefied natural gas (LNG) prices.Oil Search, backed by Total, had also bid for InterOil, but said on Thursday it would not raise its offer. The two companies agreed that letting ExxonMobil take over InterOil, which owns a 36.5 percent stake in the Elk-Antelope gas field, would help speed up development of the discovery, it said.The majors are targeting Papua New Guinea for growth as the quality of its gas, low costs and proximity to Asia's big liquefied natural gas (LNG) consumers make it one of the most attractive places to develop projects following a collapse in oil and gas prices.Total had envisioned building a new $10 billion LNG project, but said it was now committed to working with ExxonMobil's PNG LNG, which could use Elk-Antelope gas to feed an expansion.""This scenario would be the lowest cost viable supply in the Pacific Basin,"" said Saul Kavonic, an analyst at consultants Wood Mackenzie. Oil Search, a partner in both PNG LNG plant and Papua LNG, estimates that around $2 billion could be saved by tying the two projects together.""For Oil Search shareholders, the successful takeover of InterOil by ExxonMobil will deliver a major part of our original objectives in the acquisition of InterOil and our agreement with Total SA, without shareholder dilution and any acquisition risk,"" Oil Search Managing Director Peter Botten said in a statement.Total, operator of the Elk-Antelope fields, said late on Wednesday it was committed to cooperating with the PNG LNG project to maximize the value of the gas. ""It's going to come down to how you carve up that value pie. Those are the negotiations that will have to take place in order for that joint development to occur,"" said Kavonic.Oil Search and Total highlighted a recent certification of the gas field's reserves at less than 6.5 trillion cubic feet, compared to InterOil's dream of 10 tcf, as a factor in their analysis of the best development option for Elk-Antelope. ExxonMobil declined to comment.ExxonMobil has offered $45 worth of its shares plus $7.07 per share for each trillion cubic feet equivalent (tcfe) above 6.2 tcfe up to a maximum of 10 tcfe for each InterOil share.

854,"  MELBOURNE, July 21 Australia's Oil Search Ltd on Thursday cleared the way for ExxonMobil Corp to take over InterOil Corp for $2.2 billion, opting not to raise its rival offer for its partner in a rich Papua New Guinea gas field.ExxonMobil this week trumped an offer for InterOil from Oil Search, which was backed by Total SA, in a move that could lead to the U.S. and French giants tying together their competing gas export projects in the South Pacific nation.Oil Search said it made sense to let ExxonMobil take over InterOil, which owns a 36.5 percent stake in the Elk-Antelope gas field, as the U.S. giant would help speed up development of the field, by using the gas to expand its existing PNG LNG (liquefied natural gas) plant rather than having Total build a new Papua LNG plant. ""For Oil Search shareholders, the successful takeover of InterOil by ExxonMobil will deliver a major part of our original objectives in the acquisition of InterOil and our agreement with Total SA, without shareholder dilution and any acquisition risk,"" Oil Search Managing Director Peter Botten said in a statement, as expected. The oil giants are targeting Papua New Guinea for growth as the quality of its gas, low costs and proximity to Asia's big liquefied natural gas (LNG) consumers make it one of the few places where expansions are affordable at a time when oil and LNG prices have collapsed.

865,"   By Osamu Tsukimori | TOKYO  TOKYO Japanese oil refiner TonenGeneral Sekiyu has bought its first oil from Iran since becoming independent from U.S. oil major Exxon Mobil Corp, three industry sources familiar with the matter said. The company bought the Iranian spot cargo through a trading house due to attractive pricing and the shipment arrived Japan earlier this month, the sources said. TonenGeneral, formerly a unit of Exxon Mobil, previously could not buy Iranian oil due to its affiliation with the U.S. oil company. TonenGeneral bought a controlling stake in itself from Exxon in 2012, reducing Exxon's stake from 50 percent to 22 percent as the oil major pulled back from Japan due to the country's declining oil demand. Exxon Mobil has since sold that remaining stake in Japan's second-biggest oil refiner by capacity, shedding its last holding in TonenGeneral by early this year.      TonenGeneral Sekiyu, an aggressive buyer of cheaper crude grades, is known for having one of Japan's highest ratios of spot crude compared to term volumes, and will consider buying more Iranian oil depending on economics, the sources said. A TonenGeneral spokesman said the company cannot comment on the spot crude purchase.  Iran has been regaining market share faster than analysts had expected after sanctions were lifted in January, and its exports are projected to be above 2 million barrels per day for a fourth month in July. Japan's crude imports from Iran nearly halved last year from 2011 levels due to the sanctions, but there are signs of a recovery in imports this year, with industry sources saying some Japanese buyers are looking to hike purchases of Iranian oil on a spot basis.     Japan has imported 192,180 bpd of Iranian crude January-May this year, up 1.9 percent from the same period a year ago. Japan's crude import figures for June, including from Iran, are due out on Friday.

867,"   By Ernest Scheyder | HOUSTON  HOUSTON Chevron Corp (CVX.N) posted its worst quarterly loss since 2001 on Friday and Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) reported a 59 percent slide in profit, as the long crude price rout CLc1LCOc1 and tumbling refining income inflicted pain across the energy sector.The weak results from two of the world's largest oil producers come as the energy industry is at a crossroads, trying to survive in an era of low prices, which many analysts see as the new status quo, while funding expensive growth projects crucial for long-term survival.""It's a challenging environment for the integrated"" oil producers, said Brian Youngberg, an energy analyst with Edward Jones. ""The key is to manage the cash flow as best they can and continue to execute on projects, which they do appear to be doing.""Exxon, the world's largest publicly traded oil producer, shocked Wall Street as its quarterly profit missed expectations, sending its shares down as much as 4.5 percent on Friday. Its profit from producing oil and gas fell about 85 percent to $294 million. In the United States, where Exxon is the largest natural gas producer and a major oil producer, the company lost money.Exxon executives defended their business model, saying they have the financial flexibility to do many things, including large acquisitions, while maintaining their dividend. The company did cut most of its share buyback program earlier this year.Standard & Poor's downgraded the company's vaunted ""AAA"" credit rating to ""AA+"" earlier this year, as dividends and capital expenditures were exceeding cash flow.This month Exxon said it would pay more than $2.5 billion in stock for InterOil Corp (IOC.N), expanding its push into the Asian liquefied natural gas market. Chevron, the second-largest U.S.-based oil producer, reported its largest quarterly loss in 15 years, with Chief Executive Officer John Watson acknowledging the company is in the midst of an ""ongoing adjustment to a lower oil price world.""The company lost $1.47 billion in the quarter, compared with a net profit of $571 million in the year-ago period.Still, Chevron's results beat expectations, with analysts confident in the company's ability to cut costs as it brings several large projects online in the next few years.The results from both companies came after disappointing results from European peers Shell and BP earlier this week. 'RESOLUTE' ON DIVIDENDS The weak results could force the companies to reconsider their long-held policies of maintaining and growing their quarterly dividends, especially after ConocoPhillips (COP.N), Marathon Oil Corp (MRO.N) and others cut their payouts earlier this year. So far during this two-year downturn Exxon and Chevron have held their dividends as sacrosanct, while curbing stock repurchases.  Chevron Chief Financial Officer Pat Yarrington sidestepped questions about a potential dividend increase later this year  on the company's quarterly conference call, saying only the board of directors ""fully understands the value of a dividend increase.""Jeff Woodbury, Exxon's head of investor relations, said on a  call with investors that the company was ""resolute in our commitment to pay a reliable and growing dividend.""After providing bumper profits early in the downturn as cheap crude slashed their costs, refiners saw the income erode this quarter on fuel oversupply. The refining industry has been hammered of late by growing fuel inventories and weak demand, denting its profitability.The oversupply has led to so-called run cuts, in which refiners trim the amount of crude they process. Exxon processed 4 percent less crude in the quarter than a year ago and produced less gasoline.""Once the product tanks are full, as they are now, and you even have floating product storage in places like New York harbor, then you know that the situation is bad. You have to cut runs,"" said Oystein Berentsen, managing director for crude oil trading firm Strong Petroleum in Singapore.Exxon shares dropped 1.8 percent to $88.57 while Chevron eased 0.3 percent to $102.06.

873,"  HOUSTON Exxon Mobil Corp, the world's largest publicly traded oil producer, posted a lower-than-expected quarterly profit on Friday due to weak crude prices and refining income, reflecting the broad malaise in the energy sector.Net income slumped to $1.7 billion, or 41 cents per share, in the second quarter, from $4.19 billion, or $1 per share, in the year-ago period.Analysts, though, expected earnings of 64 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.The earnings miss surprised Wall Street, and Exxon shares fell 2.5 percent to $87.96 in premarket trading. The company is normally known for hitting earnings targets and the miss was its first since the second quarter of last year.        Production during the quarter fell about 0.6 percent to 3.9 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d).While Exxon slashed its capital budget by 38 percent during the quarter, to $5.16 billion, cost cuts were not enough to offset depressed oil prices, which have dragged down huge swaths of the commodities sector.  Exxon's profit from producing oil and gas fell about 85 percent to $294 million. In the United States, where Exxon is the largest natural gas producer and a major oil producer, the company lost money. In the refining unit, which has been hammered by growing fuel inventories and weak demand, Exxon's profit fell more than 60 percent due to shrinking margins. In previous quarters in this downturn, before fuel inventories swelled, the refining unit had helped insulate Exxon from falling crude prices.    Rex Tillerson, Exxon's chief executive officer, said the overall results reflected the ""volatile industry environment,"" but defended the company's integrated business model, where oil production and refining are under the same umbrella.

It also ponders ""investigations of representations made by companies to investors, consumers and the public regarding fossil fuels, renewable energy and climate change.""After numerous filings under sunshine laws, a copy of the agreement was obtained by the Energy & Environment Legal Institute, a free-market think tank. The Competitive Enterprise Institute, whose website says it opposes U.S. Environmental Protection Agency regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, had also sought the documents.""This is far less a proper common interest agreement than a sweeping cloak of secrecy,"" said Chris Horner, a lawyer who represents the Energy & Environment Legal Institute. The attorneys general, as previously reported, received guidance from well-known climate scientists and environmental lawyers before announcing the Exxon probe. Critics have called this a sign of meddling by special interests, though prosecutors' offices have made clear climate change is a top concern of voters.New York state's attorney's general office said confidentiality agreements are used often.""Entering into a common interest agreement is routine practice during a multistate investigation. These agreements preserve the confidentiality of non-public information shared among state law enforcement officials,"" the office told Reuters.Exxon, which has said that it has acknowledged the reality of climate change for years, has called subpoenas stemming from the inquiry unreasonable. It has also said it is being unfairly targeted by climate activists. The company, which supports a revenue-neutral carbon tax, declined to comment.A U.S. House of Representatives committee last month issued subpoenas to the attorneys general of New York and Massachusetts over their investigations of whether Exxon misled investors on climate change risks. The two state officials said they would refuse to comply with the subpoenas, with one calling it ""unconstitutional and unwarranted"" interference.In a bid to try to force action on climate change, the state attorneys general said in March they would jointly investigate whether Exxon executives misled the public by contradicting research from company scientists that spelled out the threats of global warming.A pact was signed in May and included California, Connecticut, the District of Columbia, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, Washington state and the U.S. Virgin Islands.But only a couple formal inquiries have started. In June, the Virgin Islands withdrew its subpoena after Exxon called it overly burdensome and raised questions about jurisdiction.

883,"   By Oleg Vukmanovic  and Stephen Jewkes | MILAN  MILAN Aug 5 Italian oil firm Eni has wrapped up long-running talks to sell a multi-billion dollar stake in its planned Mozambique liquefied natural gas (LNG) development to Exxon Mobil, two sources with knowledge of the matter said.""The deal is done but won't be announced for several months at Exxon's request,"" one of the sources said.Eni declined to comment, while a spokesman for Exxon said, ""We do not comment on market rumours or speculation"".The offshore gas reserves already discovered by Eni in Area 4 are large enough to need a giant land-based LNG export plant whose proximity to Asian and Middle Eastern growth markets makes it potentially a highly-lucrative project.But talks to bring in a technically-savvy partner with deep pockets like Exxon have dragged on due to a differences over valuations in the light of falling oil and gas prices. In 2013 Eni sold 20 percent of its Area 4 licence to China's CNPC for $4.2 billion but since then oil and gas prices have come down by more than half.However, last year Mozambique awarded Exxon three offshore exploration licence blocks of its own which sit to the south of Eni's discoveries, giving a new dimension to development prospects.""As you are aware, on October 28, 2015, Exxon was awarded three offshore blocks in Mozambique,"" the spokesman for Exxon said. ""We look forward to further discussions with the Mozambique government on the development of a production-sharing contract for the blocks.""Eni has been reluctant to sell too much of its 50 percent stake in the Area 4 permit where as operator it has already found 85 trillion cubic feet of gas.But in recent weeks Eni Chief Executive Claudio Descalzi has raised the possibility of it selling up to a 25 percent stake, up from the 10-15 percent previously on offer. The two sources said after lengthy talks, Eni and Exxon have now agreed terms and ""sealed"" a deal that could give Exxon its desired operating stake in the onshore LNG export plant while Eni would retain control over the Area 4 gas fields feeding it.Last week Descalzi reiterated Eni's desire to remain operator for the gas fields.""Our model is to remain and keep the operatorship or keep, in any case, a clear control on the asset - the asset that we discovered,"" he told analysts.While Eni will export gas as LNG from at least one floating offshore platform in the Coral field development in Area 4, the main focus of work will be on the larger land-based plants.The Coral field will remain outside the scope of the deal with Exxon, the sources said, and Eni has earmarked LNG from the Phase I development of Coral to BP.

886,"   By Stephen Jewkes and Oleg Vukmanovic | MILAN  MILAN Aug 12 Italy's Eni is talking to oil companies including Lukoil, ExxonMobil, Total and BP about selling at least a 20 percent stake in its giant gas field in Egypt, industry sources said.Eni owns the whole of Zohr and has said it is interested in bringing in partners as part of its strategy of selling some of its prize acreage to help meet a target of raising 5 billion euros from asset disposal over the next two years.Analyst have said a 25 percent stake in the Zohr field, the Mediterranean's biggest, could fetch up to 2 billion euros  ($2.24 billion).Chief Executive Claudio Descalzi has said any deal on Zohr would have to wait until next year when final appraisals are complete and production kicks in. ""It may be early days but Eni has started talking,"" said one banker familiar with the Italian group.Eni, Total and Exxon did not comment, while BP said it did not comment on rumour and speculation. Lukoil declined immediate comment.A run of big gas finds off the Egyptian coast have made the country a top destination for energy investment even as firms seek to save cash to better handle low oil prices. Many of the companies looking at Eni's Zohr are either already active in Egypt or have recently landed bordering acreage in Cyprus, such as Exxon Mobil and Total.Zohr, one of the largest gas discoveries this century, holds an estimated 30 trillion cubic feet of gas and has relatively low development costs. A lot of infrastructure is also already in place, including an idle LNG facility at Damietta, and Cairo is willing to pay explorers attractive rates to satisfy internal demand.""For the likes of BP and Eni there is huge domestic demand  so any gas they find can be sent into the local market and they can get a good price for it,"" Wood Mackenzie analyst Adam Pollard said.BP, already a major oil and gas producer in Egypt, has pumped billions of dollars into developing its huge West Nile Delta gas license and fast-tracked work on its latest find, the Atoll field in Egypt.Pollard said BP's appetite for a stake in Zohr could be tempered though by the $3 billion development costs at Atoll.

887,"  HOUSTON Exxon Mobil Corp and Motiva Enterprises refineries continued to operate at reduced levels amidst flood waters in southern Louisiana, sources familiar with operations at each refinery said on Thursday.An Exxon spokeswoman said the Baton Rouge Complex, which includes a 502,500 bpd refinery, continued to operate on Thursday, but declined to discuss the level of production or the status of specific units. The Baton Rouge refinery is the fourth largest in the United States.Production at the Baton Rouge refinery was at about 60 percent of capacity on Thursday due in part to the shutdown of a 110,000 bpd crude distillation unit on Tuesday to reduce liquified petroleum gas (LPG) from the refinery, the Exxon sources said.Exxon had also cut production in half on a 210,000 bpd CDU for maintenance planned prior to the floods. A coking unit has also been shut at the refinery, the sources said. Exxon's Sorrento, Louisiana, facility for storing LPG was inundated and shut down early this week, according to the sources. Until Exxon restarted a unit at its Baton Rouge chemical plant to take LPG from the refinery on Wednesday, the company was preparing to shut the refinery.Motiva's 235,000 bpd Convent, Louisiana refinery has been at reduced production since an Aug. 11 fire on the heavy oil hydrocracker shut that unit. Sources familiar with Motiva's operations said the Convent refinery continued to operate with staffing reduced to only essential workers, the Motiva sources said.

""It is our practice not to comment on specific unit operations at our facilities. We do expect to meet contractual commitments.""Normally, the 502,500 bpd Baton Rouge refinery sends LPG to the Sorrento, Louisiana Storage Facility where it is kept underground in salt dome caverns until needed. Flooding forced the closure of the facility over the weekend, said the sources, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter.The floods, centered on the Baton Rouge area, have claimed at least 11 lives and forced thousands of people from their homes. On Tuesday, Exxon shut a 110,000 bpd crude distillation unit at the refinery to reduce LPG production and the company was prepared on Wednesday to shut the refinery if the chemical plant unit could not be started, the sources said.The chemical plant unit will process the LPG produced by the refinery, the sources said. The refinery's production level is down to about 60 percent of capacity.In addition to the chemical plant unit shut on Tuesday, Exxon cut production on a 210,000 bpd CDU in half for maintenance planned prior to the floods, the sources said.  Two other CDUs at the refinery have a combined capacity of 180,000 bpd. The CDUs do the initial refining of crude oil coming into a refinery and provide feedstock for all other units.Motiva Enterprises LLC's 235,000 bpd Convent, Louisiana refinery continues to operate with only essential personnel due to flooding in the area, said sources familiar with the company's operations.

Together, they offer a glimpse into the future of a lower carbon world.Though oil companies typically advertise at big sporting events, the ads are being run as Exxon faces growing pressure on multiple fronts - from shareholders, green groups and state attorney generals - to respond to global warming.Many other fossil fuel companies also face pressure from shareholders, specifically over whether the value of their oil and gas assets would be slashed as governments clamp down on carbon emissions.From the opening ceremony of the Games on Aug. 5 to Aug. 17, Exxon spent $19.3 million to air ads 233 times in the U.S. market, reaching about 335 million TV screens, according to iSpot.tv, which tracks ad viewership in real time using advanced analytics.

In Australia alone, Exxon Mobil has put up for sale a September cargo at Gorgon with Conoco Phillips' Darwin project offering two, plus a single shipment from North West Shelf. Two September cargoes from Trinidad are up for grabs as are supplies from Indonesia's Donggi Senoro, as well as Abu Dhabi, and even Algeria's Sonatrach is scouting out spot buyers, industry sources said.In Argentina where state-run energy buyer Enarsa is grappling with oversupply following a spate of recent tender purchases, traders reported cargo cancellations as well as delivery postponements.""For players that are supplying Bahia Blanca (terminal) those sellers are having the most intensive discussions about diverting or cancelling cargoes, and at Escobar less so because it is more difficult to divert,"" the first trading source said. Enarsa has already cancelled two LNG shipments, as well as having postponed imports on other supply, as talks continue on further supply, he said.Unusually, prices have hardly reacted. Instead, traders point to counter-balancing factors including a 10 percent jump in Brent crude oil prices since last week, plus demand from Gail India and Japan's Kansai Electric. Force majeure on gas supplies to Nigeria LNG has hit one oil major particularly hard, sources say, prompting replacement buying, which in a logistically-determined market like LNG can leave only a few tenable alternatives available.Differences between lean and rich cargoes, as well as loading dates that must fit into delivery schedules, mean the oil major may only be able to replace lost Nigerian supply from a limited number of sources.(Reporting by Oleg Vukmanovic; Editing by Susan Thomas)",2016-08-19,XOM,"Fri Aug 19, 2016 | 12:09pm EDT","GLOBAL LNG-Prices dip on new tenders as Argentina cancels, defers imports",http://www.reuters.com//article/global-lng-idUSL8N1B03HD?type=companyNews

894,"  MELBOURNE Aug 23 ExxonMobil Corp's  Papua New Guinea liquefied natural gas (LNG) project is eyeing multi-year contracts for sales of spot cargoes to soak up excess production, co-owner Oil Search said on Tuesday.The unusual move for the LNG industry, dominated by long-term contracts, reflects strong output at PNG LNG, which is producing 12 percent above nameplate capacity at 7.7 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) two years after start-up.The project sold eight spot cargoes in the first half of this year, beyond the 6.6 mtpa locked in long-term contracts to customers in Japan, China and Taiwan.The project is in the process of having the proven reserves in its foundation gas fields recertified, which Oil Search is confident will result in a bigger reserve base that could underpin multi-year contracts for future spot cargoes. ""With a positive outlook on the recertification, we'd certainly be looking at longer term strips of sales - contracts that would be potentially a number of years,"" Julian Fowles, Oil Search's executive general manager for PNG, told analysts on a conference call.Such contracts would cover a substantial portion of spot volumes, and the ""strips"" could extend to as long as five to seven years, he said. Marketing for PNG LNG is handled by ExxonMobil for all the partners. Of the eight spot cargoes sold in the first half of 2016, six went to Japanese customers, who like the PNG gas for its high heating value, or high energy content. Other buyers outside the core customers have also started picking up spot cargoes.""So we've got other customers getting used to PNG LNG product - and that's also very good for future marketing of longer term spot cargoes,"" Fowles said.(Reporting by Sonali Paul; Editing by Richard Pullin)",2016-08-23,XOM,"Tue Aug 23, 2016 | 12:29am EDT",PNG LNG partners look to multi-year spot cargo deals,http://www.reuters.com//article/oil-search-results-lng-idUSL3N1B41MH?type=companyNews

898,"   By Ross Kerber | BOSTON  BOSTON BlackRock Inc withheld support from two high-profile directors at Exxon Mobil Corp, securities filings show, a rare spat apparently driven by a board communications policy at the world's largest energy company.Because top fund managers like BlackRock rarely discuss their votes in detail, filings in late August to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission provide a rare window into the influential ballots they cast at springtime shareholder meetings like the one held by Exxon on May 25, one of this year's more contentious.BlackRock, which manages nearly $5 trillion, has been criticized for largely supporting company managers on matters like executive pay or electing directors. BlackRock funds have backed corporate directors around 97 percent of the time since 2013, according to research firm Proxy Insight, and mostly backed Exxon at this year's meeting such as opposing shareholder proposals addressing climate change.BlackRock executives say they prefer to press companies behind the scenes, and vote against management only when such engagement fails. But in a rare break, filings on Friday showed funds including the $45 billion BlackRock Global Allocation Fund withheld support from Exxon directors Jay Fishman and Kenneth Frazier this year.  Fishman, who recently passed away, had been CEO of insurer Travelers. Frazier is CEO of drugmaker Merck & Co.While spokesman for BlackRock and Exxon declined to comment, BlackRock's reasoning for the votes appears to be spelled out in a recent governance report on its website. The report describes how BlackRock executives tried to discuss strategy and capital allocation with independent directors of an unnamed ""large oil and gas corporation,"" but were rebuffed because of a policy against such talks.As a result, BlackRock said it withheld support from the company's lead independent director and the chair of the committee that set the policy. Fishman had been Exxon's ""presiding director,"" meant to provide independent board leadership according to Exxon's proxy statement, while Frazier  led its board affairs committee. The two were re-elected with 88 and 90 percent of votes cast, respectively, down from 95 and 98 percent in 2015. BlackRock is Exxon's second-largest shareholder with about 6 percent of its stock, according to the proxy. Exxon's other directors got no less than 95 percent support this year.How much contact independent directors should have with outsiders has become a loaded issue because of the rise of activist investors pushing disruptive agendas. Asked about BlackRock's concern, Exxon spokesman Alan Jeffers cited a webpage outlining board communications procedures, which do not directly address the matter. But Tim Smith, who leads shareholder engagement efforts at Walden Asset Management, said Exxon executives have described at meetings the sort of policy criticized by BlackRock.Filings also showed BlackRock funds did not back resolutions at 3M Co, Illinois Tool Works Inc or Xerox Corp calling on the companies to exclude the impact of share buybacks when calculating executive pay, even though the resolutions cited the concerns about buybacks raised by BlackRock CEO Larry Fink.

899,"   By Jessica Resnick-Ault | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Exxon Mobil Corp is in the first stages of seeking a potential buyer for its Billings, Montana, refinery, one of the company's only U.S. plants that is not integrated with its chemical operations, according to people familiar with the plans.At least one potential bidder has already visited the 60,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) plant, according to two people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The refinery could fetch $500 million to $700 million, according to a person familiar with refinery valuations.Exxon said it did not comment on rumors or speculation, adding it ""regularly evaluates its global portfolio of businesses and opportunities for growth, restructuring or divestment, in accordance with the company’s overall strategic business objectives."" They added that the company ""remains committed to conducting business in Montana, as it has for more than 40 years."" Majors, including Chevron Corp and Exxon, have been shedding smaller refineries that are not integrated with their production or chemicals systems. The Billings refinery does not have chemical units, but processes oil into products such as gasoline and diesel. It is one of Exxon's two remaining U.S. refineries that does not have an adjacent chemical facility.  As refining margins have narrowed, plants that do not produce chemicals may have a less predictable profit stream, making them candidates for majors to sell off. Exxon sold its Torrance, California, refinery to PBF Energy last month. Last year, PBF bought the Chalmette, Louisiana refinery from Exxon Mobil and Petroleos de Venezuela, which had owned it jointly. Chemicals can provide another revenue stream when refining margins narrow, according to Jeff Quigley, director of energy markets at Stratas Advisors. ""The thinking has always been that integration gives more value chain flexibility,"" he said. ""Gasoline margins won't be doing much for them for awhile because the market is heavily oversupplied,"" he said.  Refineries integrated with chemical plants can produce very light fuels, known as lighter-ends, to support more profitable petrochemical facilities, he said.Potential buyers including PBF Energy Inc have visited the plant to review it this summer, according to people familiar with the process. PBF did not reply to telephone calls or emails. The plant could also attract interest from other independent refiners, as well as Canadian oil producers who want additional processing capacity, according to people familiar with refining deals.  Exxon does not usually negotiate directly with a single bidder for an asset, but prefers to run an auction process, according to people familiar with past deals. The refinery is one of the highest quality plants in the Rocky Mountains, with a fluidized coking unit for refining heavy oil, according to people familiar with the region's infrastructure.The plant primarily processes crude either imported from Canada or transported from nearby Wyoming. The proximity to Wyoming's discounted crude makes it particularly desirable, people said. It, along with Chevron Corp's Salt Lake City, Utah, refinery, is viewed as a top asset in the Rocky Mountains, according to Matthew Blair, an equity researcher at Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. ""Every inland refiner would be interested,"" Blair said. ""They're small for the majors, but the rate of return on them is going to be good.""

904,"   By Ron Bousso and Tom Finn | LONDON/DOHA  LONDON/DOHA Qatar Petroleum is interested in the Mozambique gas business of Italian energy group Eni and could opt to join Exxon Mobil in buying a multibillion-dollar stake, sources familiar with the matter said.    State-controlled Eni is looking to reduce a 50 percent stake in its giant Mozambique gas acreage as part of plans to sell 5 billion euros of assets over the next two years.    Last month sources told Reuters Exxon had reached a deal that could give it an operating stake in the onshore liquefied natural gas (LNG) export plant, while leaving Eni in control of the Area 4 gas fields feeding it.    Qatar Petroleum is in talks with Exxon and Eni on some kind of involvement in Mozambique which could involve a joint investment with the U.S. major, one senior QP source said, adding the deal was not a classic joint venture structure.    A second Doha-based source, who declined to be named as not authorized to speak publicly, said Qatar Petroleum had been looking at Eni's Area 4 field as well as adjoining acreage of Anadarko Petroleum Corp but added the focus was on Eni.    ""The expectation is that Qatar Petroleum and Exxon will go in on this together,"" the source said, adding a Qatar Petroleum delegation planned to visit Mozambique before the year end.     The sources cautioned no decision had as yet been taken by the Qatari company.    Qatar Petroleum did not respond to requests for comment and Exxon and Eni declined to comment.     Saad al-Kaabi, Qatar Petroleum CEO, recently confirmed the group was looking at assets in Africa.Located in Mozambique's Rovuma Basin, Eni's Area 4 is one of the biggest discoveries of recent times, holding about 85 trillion cubic feet of gas.      Eni CEO Claudio Descalzi, who has spoken of selling a stake of up to 25 percent, said earlier this month a detailed agreement had been reached with a partner.    In 2013 Eni sold 20 percent of Area 4 to China's CNPC for $4.2 billion but since then oil and gas prices have dropped by more than half.    A banker with knowledge of the matter said a 25 percent stake in the field could be worth in the region of 2 billion euros. Exxon and QP are already close business partners in Qatar, where Exxon's technical know-how helped the tiny Gulf state to develop its gas resources and become the world's biggest as well as lowest-cost LNG producer. Since then, both companies have jointly moved to exploit international LNG growth opportunities, including plans to build the Golden Pass liquefaction plant in the United States and  bidding for exploration acreage in Cyprus. A moratorium on new Qatari gas production since 2005 has hobbled domestic expansion opportunities at a time of intense competition for global LNG market share as new producers such as Australia challenge Qatar's dominance.

924,"   By Laura Zuckerman  ExxonMobil Corp. has agreed to pay $12 million to Montana and the U.S. government to restore natural resources damaged or destroyed by a pipeline rupture in 2011 that spilled oil into the Yellowstone River, according to a settlement proposed on Wednesday.ExxonMobil Pipeline Company's Silvertip pipeline burst July 1, 2011 at a crossing beneath the flood-swollen Yellowstone River near Billings, Montana, about 150 miles (241 km) downstream from Yellowstone National Park. The release of 1,500 barrels of crude oil affected 85 miles of a river known for its near pristine waters, wealth of wildlife and world-class fisheries.Under the agreement unveiled Wednesday, funds from Exxon would be used to mitigate harm caused by the spill to fish, wildlife, migratory birds and aquatic habitat. A restoration plan drafted by the state and federal governments would, among other things, seek to restore riparian and terrestrial habitats, stabilize river banks and expand fishing access in and around the river. The deal struck between the Texas-based oil company and Montana, the U.S. Department of Justice and other federal agencies still must be approved by a U.S. District Court judge in Montana and is subject to 30 days of public comment, legal documents show.The settlement and proposed restoration plan follow a years-long assessment of damages from the pipeline leak to the river and its floodplains.Montana Governor Steve Bullock and Attorney General Tim Fox hailed the agreement for holding Exxon accountable and helping to make whole a state that boasts a $6 billion outdoor economy. But Alexis Bonogofsky, whose pastures along the Yellowstone River were fouled five years ago by oil-tainted water said she was disappointed by the size of the settlement.""I'm sorry, but $12 million is a drop in the bucket for ExxonMobil and doesn't teach them anything about accountability,"" she said.Exxon spokeswoman Ashley Smith Alemayehu said the company was sorry for the accident. ""We regret this spill happened and are committed to learning from it to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future,"" she said in a statement. Under a 2012 deal between Exxon and the Montana Department of Environmental Quality, the oil company paid a fine of $1.6 million in connection with the spill, the largest penalty ever levied in the state for violations of its water quality regulations.The same year, Exxon estimated its overall response to the spill, including cleanup, would cost $135 million and said it had reached compensation agreements with more than 95 percent of affected property owners.

To give the sector a boost, the government announced on Thursday it is removing taxes on oil and gas exploration.""Reversing some of the changes introduced with GR79 is a significant step in the right direction, but in the current oil price environment, it could take several years to restore investor confidence in Indonesia's oil and gas sector,"" said Johan Utama, an analyst at energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie.Southeast Asia's biggest economy has strong potential for energy demand growth and holds the second-largest proved gas reserves in the Asia-Pacific, but bureaucracy and regulatory uncertainty have hampered the sector's development, industry analysts say.  ""The reduction in global exploration budgets will result in a focus on lower cost, lower risk prospects, in regimes that offer the best investment returns in the shortest possible timeframe,"" Utama said.""This will be challenging for Indonesia, where regulatory uncertainty and bureaucracy have led to the delay or suspension of several key oil and gas projects.""Indonesia wants to ramp up oil and gas production to bolster government finances. The sector is expected to contribute just 3.4 percent to state revenue in 2016, down from 25 percent in 2006. Indonesia is an OPEC member but has been a net oil importer for years. Oil production has declined steadily from a peak of 1.7 million barrels per day in 1991 to an average of 786,000 bpd in 2015, according to Indonesian government data.  Indonesia's total proved oil reserves stood at 3.6 billion barrels at end-2015, the lowest since BP started collecting data in 1980. The country holds the second largest proved gas reserves after China, although that has also dropped from a peak in 2008, BP's data showed.Chevron Corp, ExxonMobil and Total are among the largest investors in Indonesia.Investors are waiting to see if the government will improve  the fiscal terms in production sharing contracts, such as giving investors a larger share of the output that would boost returns and cash flow at oil and gas companies. ""It's not going to make people fall off the chair and then invest right away.

936,"  MAPUTO Mozambique Energy Minister Pedro Couto has been sacked, the presidency said on Thursday, a month before Italy's Eni is due to finalize an offshore gas project worth tens of billions of dollars.No reason was given for the dismissal of Couto, who had held the energy portfolio since January 2015. A separate statement said he had been appointed as president of Mozambique's Cahora Bassa hydroelectric power company.The southern African state discovered offshore gas reserves six years ago amounting to some 85 trillion cubic feet, one of the largest finds in a decade and enough to supply Germany, Britain, France and Italy for nearly two decades.The gas offers Mozambique an opportunity to transform itself from one of the world's poorest countries into a middle-income state and a major global liquefied natural gas (LNG) exporter. Negotiations with operators Eni and U.S. firm Anadarko have dragged on for years due to disputes over terms and concerns about falling energy prices. However, there have been several signs of significant progress in recent months.Eni met with bankers in London last week about project financing to develop the Coral field, a significant step in getting the first of a series of long-delayed LNG projects off the ground. Eni struck a deal in July with Samsung Heavy as part of a consortium with France's Technip and Japan's JGC to build a floating LNG platform in a deal worth around $5.4 billion. Exxon Mobil is close to buying into Eni's Mozambique's assets, sources told Reuters last month.

937,"   By Katya Golubkova | YUZHNO-SAKHALINSK/PRIGORODNOYE, Russia  YUZHNO-SAKHALINSK/PRIGORODNOYE, Russia Gazprom said on Thursday it plans to launch a third liquefied natural gas (LNG) production train at the Sakhalin-2 LNG plant in 2021, possibly fed by a newly drilled field, as Russian companies seek to boost their share of the global LNG market. Russia accounts for less than 5 percent of the global LNG market but new plants are being built or considered by Novatek, Gazprom and Rosneft. Located at Prigorodnoye on Sakhalin island, Sakhalin-2, Russia's sole LNG plant, operates two production lines with a combined capacity of 10 million tonnes of LNG per year. The third train should add another 5 million tonnes. An obstacle to expanding the plant, operated by Gazprom, Royal Dutch Shell, Japan's Mitsui and Mitsubishi, is the resource base. Shareholders are considering two options: buying gas from the Sakhalin-1 project led by ExxonMobil, developing new resources or a combination. Yet, Sakhalin-1, where the state oil firm Rosneft is also a shareholder, is aiming for its own LNG plant.    Vsevolod Cherepanov, a Gazprom board member, said that the first exploitation well at the Yuzhno-Kirinskoye field, viewed as a source of fuel for Sakhalin-2 expansion, aimed to be drilled in 2017, with production to start in test mode in 2021 and in full operation in 2022. ""The plateau of 21 billion cubic meters (bcm) a year is expected to be reached in ten years. We will start from 3 bcm,"" Cherepanov said. For the third train to operate, a total of 7-8 bcm of gas per year is needed, he added.""We also have Kirinskoye field with (expected) 5.5 bcm (a year)... (But) 50 percent of volumes is enough to launch the third train. We will increase volumes a year after that."" Cherepanov said talks were ongoing with a Chinese company over a drilling platform for Yuzhno-Kirinskoye, but Gazprom may also drill on its own. In 2015, the United States restricted exports, re-exports and transfers of technology and equipment to the Yuzhno-Kirinskoye field, making it harder to develop.      Gazprom executives have said they will find a way to bring the field on stream. The company said this month it had discovered a new gas deposit in the Sea of Okhotsk near Sakhalin island. Cherepanov said that based on preliminary information from one well, the field could contain over 40 bcm of gas, yet to be proved, but could not replace Yuzhno-Kirinskoye as a source for Sakhalin-2 expansion. PERSPECTIVES On Thursday, a LNG tanker could be seen on its way from the facility in Prigorodnoye to Asia-Pacific markets. It takes 2-3 days to reach Japan or South Korea, major LNG consumers.      Olivier Lazare, head of Royal Dutch Shell in Russia, said on Wednesday that shareholders at Sakhalin-2 had agreed on the strategy of marketing LNG from the planned third train. He declined to provide details.Two sources close to the project said that there were no commercial talks with buyers yet, though one source said shareholders has agreed on general principles for marketing. The proximity of Asian markets is behind the idea of Sakhalin-1 shareholders to build their own LNG facility, with initial capacity of 5 million tonnes a year and start after 2023. ""In the current pricing environment, it (the LNG project) remains competitive but challenging,"" a source close to the planned plant, known as Far East LNG, said. Asian LNG spot prices are under $6 per mmBtu, down from more than $20 between 2010 and 2014, due to soaring output from Australia and the United States. Given low prices were putting on hold plans for LNG facilities, there could be a deficit on the market from 2023, according to Mark Gyetvay, chief financial officer with Novatek.""If we look at Russia increasing its supplies of LNG it is reasonable to assume that Sakhalin LNG can expand their project,"" Gyetvay told Reuters this month. Novatek plans to ship its first LNG cargoes from a new facility in Russia's Yamal peninsula next year and is considering building its second LNG facility, Arctic LNG-2.

938,"   By Katya Golubkova | YUZHNO-SAKHALINSK/PRIGORODNOYE, Russia  YUZHNO-SAKHALINSK/PRIGORODNOYE, Russia Gazprom said on Thursday it plans to launch a third liquefied natural gas (LNG) production train at the Sakhalin-2 LNG plant in 2021, possibly fed by a newly drilled field, as Russian companies seek to boost their share of the global LNG market. Russia accounts for less than 5 percent of the global LNG market but new plants are being built or considered by Novatek, Gazprom and Rosneft. Located at Prigorodnoye on Sakhalin island, Sakhalin-2, Russia's sole LNG plant, operates two production lines with a combined capacity of 10 million tonnes of LNG per year. The third train should add another 5 million tonnes. An obstacle to expanding the plant, operated by Gazprom, Royal Dutch Shell, Japan's Mitsui and Mitsubishi, is the resource base. Shareholders are considering two options: buying gas from the Sakhalin-1 project led by ExxonMobil, developing new resources or a combination. Yet, Sakhalin-1, where the state oil firm Rosneft is also a shareholder, is aiming for its own LNG plant.    Vsevolod Cherepanov, a Gazprom board member, said that the first exploitation well at the Yuzhno-Kirinskoye field, viewed as a source of fuel for Sakhalin-2 expansion, aimed to be drilled in 2017, with production to start in test mode in 2021 and in full operation in 2022. ""The plateau of 21 billion cubic meters (bcm) a year is expected to be reached in ten years. We will start from 3 bcm,"" Cherepanov said.

939,"  * Gas-to-power projects to add 3,000 MW to grid* Exxon, Shell among bidders for LNG, power supply* South Africa prefers floating LNG facilitiesBy Wendell RoelfCAPE TOWN, Oct 3 South Africa will announce preferred bidders for multi-billion dollar gas-to-power projects by the end of March as part of efforts to diversify electricity production away from more environmentally damaging coal plants, a government document shows.Tender documents in May last year asked consortia to submit plans to build South Africa's first liquefied natural gas (LNG) import terminal, gas-fired power plants, storage facilities and transmission pipelines, according to a department of energy memorandum due to be released on Monday and seen by Reuters. Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch Shell are among more than 100 bidders for the gas projects, which South Africa hopes will add more than 3,000 megawatts (MW) to its current power production capacity of 42,000 MW.A separate 600 MW gas-fired power plant is also being developed in parallel by the department of energy's independent power producers unit. South Africa already imports gas from neighbouring Mozambique and could buy LNG from major African producers such as Nigeria and Angola, analysts said.A drop in global energy prices has encouraged South Africa to push ahead with gas-to-power projects as it looks to quickly increase electricity supply capacity following nationwide outages last year.""The current global gas and LNG market conditions are expected to represent an opportunity for South Africa to achieve an economically beneficial pricing arrangement in the oil and gas cycle,"" the document said. The department of energy has a preference for floating regasification and storage facilities due to the speed with which they can be built.The most likely location for new gas-fired power plants are at Richards Bay and Coega, the document said.South Africa has separate plans for huge nuclear power expansion which could cost up to 1 trillion rand ($73 billion).($1 = 13.62 rand)   (Editing by Joe Brock and Mark Potter)",2016-10-03,XOM,"Mon Oct 3, 2016 | 5:22am EDT",South Africa to name preferred bidders for gas projects in March,http://www.reuters.com//article/safrica-gas-idUSL8N1BW1G2?type=companyNews

946,"  (Adds statement, background from PBF Energy; Exxon Mobil lawsuit)By Liz HamptonHOUSTON Oct 14 PBF Energy Inc has received a violation notice from air regulators for excessive flaring at its Torrance refinery in Los Angeles, just days after an outage at a local utility knocked the facility offline yet again.On Tuesday, the refiner reported flaring at the 151,300-barrel-per-day refinery following a 26-minute power interruption to Southern California Edison's system. Some 90,000 businesses and homes also lost power as a result of the outage. A similar incident occurred at the refinery in the second half of September, which required it to run at reduced rates for almost two weeks.PBF on Friday said the company has experienced four power interruptions in the last month that originated outside of the refinery. It was not clear if the other two interruptions took the facility offline. The outages come just months after the Torrance refinery resumed normal operations following more than a year-long breakdown of its fluid catalytic cracking unit (FCCU). That unit, which produces gasoline, went offline in February 2015 following an explosion at the refinery, which at the time was operated by Exxon Mobil. The South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) will file a petition next week that will seek improvements in the refiner's reliability of power supply, electrical infrastructure, monitoring and overall maintenance, according to a notice published Thursday.PBF spokesman Michael Karlovich said the company disagreed with the air regulators characterization of the flaring events, and that it was working with the SCAQMD and Southern California Edison to address the reliability of the grid serving the refinery.Exxon Mobil earlier this year lost lawsuit filed in 2012 against Southern California Edison over power reliability. Exxon is appealing that ruling.

953,"   By Ethan Lou | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Oil prices jumped more than 2 percent on Wednesday, with U.S. crude settling at its highest in 15 months after the government reported a surprisingly large drop in inventories for the sixth week out of seven.The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said crude stocks fell 5.2 million barrels in the week ended Oct. 14, versus forecasts for a 2.7-million barrel build. [EIA/S] Crude stocks generally rise at this time of year as refineries go into maintenance. Refinery utilization is down to 85 percent from nearly 94 percent in early September.The EIA said U.S. crude imports slid by 912,000 barrels per day last week to 6.47 million bpd, the lowest since November 2015, crimping inventories.""This lowest import pace in some 16 months is surprising given the fact that OPEC production has recently attained a record level that would imply easy availability,"" said Jim Ritterbusch of Chicago-based oil markets consultancy Ritterbusch & Associates. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude's front-month contract, November, closed up $1.31, or 2.6 percent, at $51.60 a barrel for its highest settlement since July 14. Its session peak of $51.93 was the highest in 15 months.With expiry due on Thursday, the November contract saw lighter trades than December WTI, which hit a June high of $52.22. The December contract will be front-month from Friday.London-traded Brent crude settled up 99 cents, or 1.9 percent, at $52.67. Some market participants were not impressed by the crude inventory drop, citing instead the large gasoline build of 2.5 million barrels for last week versus forecasts for a 1.3 million-barrel drop.""While the headline number was bullish, we wouldn't call it extremely bullish,"" said Tariq Zahir, crude trader at Tyche Capital Advisors in New York.Oil prices have rallied 15 percent in the three weeks after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries proposed to enforce from November its first output cut since 2008. Khalid al-Falih, energy minister of Saudi Arabia, which dominates OPEC, told the Oil & Money conference in London ""fundamentals are improving and the market is clearly balancing"" after prices fell below $30 from 2014 highs above $100.But Rex Tillerson, chief executive of Exxon Mobil, the world's largest listed oil firm, later told the same conference he expected U.S. shale oil output, responsible for much of the glut, to rebound at current prices.In industry news, Enbridge, Canada's largest pipeline company, said it was shedding 5 percent of its workforce, the second layoff of that size since oil prices crashed in 2014.

954,"  * U.S. shale declines have largely stopped -Tillerson* Saudi's Falih warns supply declines to accelerate* Total CEO sees 5-10 mln bpd supply shortage by 2020By Ron Bousso and Karolin SchapsLONDON, Oct 19 Exxon Mobil's boss Rex Tillerson and Saudi Arabia's energy minister on Wednesday took opposing views on declining investment in the oil sector setting the stage for a possible major supply crunch.More than two years of downturn that saw oil prices halve to around $50 a barrel today after a boom in U.S. shale oil production have led to a sharp decline in investment.But Tillerson, who heads the world's largest listed oil and gas company, said that shale oil producers' resilience in cutting costs to make some wells profitable at as low as $40 a barrel means that North American production has effectively become a swing producer that will be able to respond rapidly to any global supply shortage.""I don't quite share the same view that others have that we are somehow on the edge of a precipice. I think because we have confirmed viability of very large resource base in North America that serves as enormous spare capacity in the system,"" Tillerson told the Oil & Money conference.""It doesn't take mega-project dollars and it can be brought on line much more quickly than a 3-4 year project,"" he said. His stance contrasted with that of Saudi Arabia's Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih, who minutes earlier warned the same event that the sector faces challenges due to the drop in investment.""Market forces are clearly working. After testing a period of sub $30 prices the fundamentals are improving and the market is clearly balancing,"" Falih said.""On the supply side, non-OPEC supply growth has reversed into declines due to major cuts in upstream investments and the steepening of decline rates,"" the minister said.""Without investment, that trend is likely to accelerate with the passage of time to the point that many analysts are now wending warning bells over future supply shortfalls and I am in that camp.""Falih said that OPEC's plan to freeze or even cut production along with several leading producing countries, including Russia, will help reduce a huge overhang of supplies and stimulate new investments in the sector. Saudi Arabia, has changed its course this year and decided to support production cuts following two years of refusal to do this in order to win the market share back from U.S. shale producers.Tillerson's remarks about the resilience of U.S. supply shone on a fresh light on Saudi calculations of the impact of lower prices, which Riyadh orchestrated in 2014, on the North American oil industry.NO PRICE BLOW OUT  Tillerson said that while U.S. shale production has dropped recently, the declines have largely stopped.""I don't necessarily agree with the premise that there is a more steep decline to come (in U.S. shale), in fact that are still some levels of uncompleted wells that can be brought on.""""It is difficult for me to see a big supply press out there, it is difficult for me to see a big price blow out, there are too many elements in the system that will temper that,"" Tillerson said.""I don't necessarily have the view that we are setting ourselves up for a big crunch within the next 3, 4, 5 years.""Echoing the Saudi minister, Patrick Pouyanne, the chief executive officer of French oil and gas company Total, expected supplies to fall short by 5 to 10 million barrels per day by the end of the decade after investments in the sector dropped from $700 billion two years ago to $400 billion this year.""We are today facing a situation where we do not invest enough... this is not enough to prepare the future supply  Without investment, the oil industry will not be able to offset the natural 5 percent natural decline of fields and meet demand growth of even 1 percent.""""I know that the shale oil industry is very innovative and they have cut costs and adapt but we won't be able, if we continue this way, to fill the gap,"" Pouyanne said.He said that Total will be able to balance its capital spending of up to $17 billion with oil at $55 a barrel next year.

U.S. oil production was one of the hardest hit in recent years but Tillerson said the declines might be coming to an end as there is a large number of uncompleted wells that could be brought onstream to help sustain U.S. output.

979,"   By Ron Bousso and Karolin Schaps | LONDON  LONDON Royal Dutch Shell and BP on Tuesday joined peers in reporting higher than expected earnings by making further deep cuts in spending to cope with an oil price downturn now in its third year.The companies said they were well on the way to adapting to the more than halving in prices. But any new sharper downturn would test their ability to invest for growth and retain the relatively large dividends their shareholders expect.Shell's stock rose by over 4 percent as it announced higher quarterly earnings than arch-rival U.S. Exxon Mobil, the world's largest listed oil company by output and market capitalization.The Anglo-Dutch major, which acquired rival BG for $54 billion earlier this year, had been under pressure to cut costs after second quarter earnings came in around 50 percent below forecasts.By contrast, BP's stock fell by more than 4 percent by 1210 ET as some analysts said its results were boosted by a one-off tax gain, meaning its longer-term profits and ability to pay dividends could still be at risk. The oil price was trading flat on the day at around $49 a barrel.Shell's Chief Executive Officer Ben van Beurden said the oil sector had yet to emerge from troubled waters, but huge cost savings meant oil majors were getting closer to balancing their operations at today's oil prices of around $50 a barrel.The prospects for an oil price recovery are still unclear, van Beurden said, despite attempts by OPEC and other producers to agree a deal to limit output and reduce the global glut which has pushed oil prices down by 50 percent since June 2014.""Lower oil prices continue to be a significant challenge across the business, and the outlook remains uncertain,"" van Beurden said. FUTURE FOCUS The world's top oil and gas companies, including Exxon and Chevron, reported sharp drops in quarterly results last week due to lower oil prices and weaker refining margins.But at the same time, most have shown they were adjusting to the new environment, with both Exxon and Chevron also beating earnings expectations. Chevron plans to focus future growth on U.S. onshore shale production, where investments are smaller and production starts faster compared to large offshore projects.Shell also sees shale production as a key future growth engine. Its Chief Financial Officer Simon Henry said the oil-rich Permian Basin in West Texas was a ""crown jewel"".Exxon warned it may need to slash proved oil and gas reserves on its books by nearly 20 percent, or some 4.6 billion barrels, if oil prices stay low for the rest of 2016. French oil major Total also beat third quarter income expectations helped by cost cuts and new projects and only smaller rivals Norway's Statoil and Italy's ENI missed expectations due to lower-than-expected output.     BP Chief Financial Officer Brian Gilvary said the British company was on track to rebalance cash flows next year at $50 to $55 a barrel and its future focus areas would include Russia and areas where it could bring technology to bear.""This allow us to sustain our dividend whilst still investing enough to grow long term,"" he said.In 2014, the world's top oil companies required an oil price of $113 a barrel in order to cover their spending and dividends, according to Jefferies analysts. The breakeven dropped to around $60 a barrel in 2016 and is expected to hover at around $50 a barrel next year.BP benefited from UK fiscal regime changes, resulting an a $164 million tax credit in the third quarter, compared with a $1.16 billion tax bill in the same quarter last year. ""Despite mixed numbers and a modest increase in gearing, the overall trend in cost and capex savings and cash flows at BP continues to head in the right direction,"" analysts from Morgan Stanley said in a note. BP reported a near halving in third-quarter earnings and slashed another $1 billion from its 2016 investment plan, while Shell saw an 18 percent rise in profits and lowered next year's capital spending to the bottom of the expected range.Both Shell and BP maintained their dividends unchanged as expected.At $2.8 billion in the third quarter, Shell's net income was above Exxon's third quarter net income of $2.65 billion. Exxon has not made a big acquisition for more than 5 years but it is still worth more than Shell - its market cap was $345 billion as of Tuesday while Shell was worth $205 billion. As well as slashing spending, oil companies have scrapped new projects, cut tens of thousands of jobs, renegotiated supply contracts and increased borrowing since prices began a sustained fall in June 2014.All the majors apart from Eni have maintained or increased their dividends throughout the downturn to retain shareholder loyalty. Shell has not cut its dividend since World War Two.

985,"   By Dmitry Zhdannikov and Ahmad Ghaddar | LONDON  LONDON As Saudi Arabia prepares for the world's biggest initial public offering (IPO), memoirs from its former oil minister Ali al-Naimi offer a rare insight into decades of domestic infighting over the future of state-run Saudi Aramco.The 300-page book, titled ""Out of the Desert"" and published by Portfolio Penguin, describes the battles waged by the influential industry veteran including fending off Western attempts to gain control of oil giant Aramco's best assets. Naimi joined Aramco as a teenager in 1947 and climbed through the ranks to become company chief from 1983 to 1995, when he was named minister of petroleum - a post he retained until his retirement this year. His career spans the rise of the ""petro-politics"" that defined the recent history of the kingdom, including the birth of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries in 1969 and the oil embargo in 1973.Even though the book holds back from detailing any political jostling within the secretive Saudi royal family and government, it gives a clear idea that various factions have often pushed for different paths for Saudi Aramco.Naimi describes several instances throughout his career when he fought top executives from Western companies including U.S. giant Exxon Mobil trying what he describes as winning lucrative deals via good connections with some Saudi officials.""They (Exxon) wanted us to turn over highly restricted information about our Ghawar field, for instance, that isn't even known within the kingdom outside of the oil ministry and Saudi Aramco,"" Naimi writes about gas talks between oil majors and Aramco at the end of the 1990s.If Aramco does list its stock as planned in 2018, investors would expect the firm to disclose classified information on its reserves, including Ghawar - Saudi Arabia's biggest oilfield.But it could avoid doing so given the sensitivity of the issue and just say that by buying into Aramco, investors would gain access to the world's cheapest reserves, still controlled by the state, according to sources briefed on the offering.Naimi retired in April and was replaced by Aramco chairman Khalid al-Falih as energy minister.  The Saudi oil portfolio is overseen by Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, 31, who has been actively promoting the Aramco IPO.Sources in the kingdom have suggested the royal family is far from united on the issue as some see the offering as giving away the crown jewels cheaply to foreigners at a time of low oil prices.Naimi says he fought hard for ""the heart and soul"" of Aramco to avoid giving Westerners unnecessarily lucrative deals.""(Exxon's then-boss) Lee Raymond for instance was trying to make the most of his relationship with (the foreign minister at the time) Prince Saud al-Faisal to get a better deal for Exxon Mobil,"" Naimi writes.Naimi says he was convinced that as part of gas talks in the 1990s, Exxon and other oil majors hoped to acquire cheap Saudi reserves of gas condensate, a high-quality form of crude oil. ""I told Lee Raymond my views and that I felt he was trying to gain an unfair advantage. Lee responded in kind and it got a little ugly. From that point onward our negotiations were over. I haven't seen Lee Raymond since, which was a shame because we were once good friends,"" Naimi continues.Naimi effectively won the battle, as Aramco offered to oil majors pure upstream gas exploration contracts without gas condensate and only Shell and Total entered into a deal.A similar fight happened a few years earlier when Naimi says Shell, Mobil and Total tried to persuade his predecessor, oil minister Hisham Nazer, to allow them to develop the Shaybah oilfield for what Naimi saw as an overly expensive contract.Naimi even says Francois Mitterrand, France's then-president, was convinced that King Fahd had promised him the field in exchange for French participation in the first Gulf War.Again, Naimi says the companies became ""greedy"". He cites praise from his successor, Falih: ""By holding his ground, minister al-Naimi was not necessarily protecting Saudi Aramco, he was protecting the kingdom from having substantial value drained away in those transactions.""As Aramco's IPO draws nearer, the issue of value drain will become increasingly relevant.To cite Naimi: ""When the camel goes down, many knives come out. That is an old Arabic proverb. In the mid-1980s the camel was Aramco, the knives were the vested interest of Saudis who viewed us as a symbol of foreign influence and the era of colonialism.""Naimi also defended Saudi Arabia's decision in November 2014 not to cut production to support falling oil prices, saying he would make the same choice again if given the chance.""I think that was, still is the right decision,"" he told an audience at Chatham House in London to promote his book.Naimi said Saudi Arabia had tried and failed to get OPEC and non-OPEC producers to cooperate in stemming falling oil prices.  ""I remember asking every OPEC minister, 'will you cut, will you cut, will you cut' and all the answers were 'no',"" he said. ""The expectation was 'you, Saudi Arabia, traditionally used to cut'.

990,"   By Liz Hampton | HOUSTON  HOUSTON Sunoco Logistics Partners (SXL.N) said on Wednesday it is forming a joint venture with Exxon Mobil (XOM.N), giving the midstream company strategic assets near the Dakota Access line while expanding its West Texas footprint for the second time in less than two months.The joint venture, called Permian Express Partners, will consist of assets owned by both companies, according to a statement. Sunoco Logistics will take a stake of 85 percent, while Exxon will control the remaining 15 percent. Sunoco Logistics will contribute its Permian Express 1 and 2, Permian Longview and Louisiana Access pipelines to the joint venture. Exxon's contribution includes its Longview to Louisiana and Pegasus pipelines, Hawkings gathering system, an idle pipeline in southern Oklahoma and its Patoka, Illinois terminal. The joint venture expands the footprint of Sunoco Logistics in West Texas, home to the prolific Permian Basin shale play. It comes less than two months after an announcement to buy Vitol's crude oil unit in the Permian for $760 million. Oil companies in recent months have rushed to secure acreage and assets in the Permian Basin, considered ""a sweet spot"" for U.S. shale producers. This has driven up dealmaking among both exploration and production companies and midstream operators. The access to Exxon's terminal gives Sunoco a ""foothold"" in Patoka, Illinois, an important oil hub in the Midwest that connects to the Dakota Access pipeline, said Dominic Haywood, an analyst at Energy Aspects in London. Under the deal, Sunoco Logistics will operate the proposed Dakota Access pipeline, which has been delayed by regulatory issues and intense opposition by environmentalists and Native American groups. Construction was halted in September, but the election of Republican Donald Trump as U.S. president may give the project a boost, as he is expected to support energy development.  Part of Exxon's Patoka to Nederland, Texas, Pegasus pipeline, is currently shut.

Shares in DCC, whose activities range from distributing oil to making Body Shop's body butters and distributing Xbox to retailers Argo and Amazon, rose almost 9 percent, making it London's top bluechip gainer.DCC has been expanding into western Europe through acquisitions, especially seeking purchases opportunities to purchase distribution and market assets from oil majors as they slim down their portfolio to ride out an oil price slump.Although customers had shown some hesitancy in the immediate aftermath of Britain's vote to leave the European Union, DCC's UK business had since performed ""exactly in line"" with its expectations, Chief Executive Tommy Breen said. ""In the week, or 10 days, immediately after the vote everybody was a little uncertain, but since our business has been performing exactly (how) we expected,"" Breen told Reuters.Some support services companies, including Capita Plc  and Mitie Group Plc, have warned of delays in decision making by customers following the Brexit vote.DCC said the acquisition of Gaz Europeen, expected to close in the first quarter of 2017, would help it grow in the French liquefied petroleum gas market, building off its purchase of French gas firm Butagaz from Shell last year. The company said it expected operating profit to be significantly ahead of the 300.5 million pounds posted in the last year ended March 31, 2016 and beat market consensus of 340 million pounds.Davy analysts hiked their full-year earnings per share forecast by 4 percent to 300 pence and target price to 7,500 pence from 7,200 pence.Excluding net exceptionals and amortisation of intangible assets, DCC's profit grew 33.3 percent to 117.8 million pounds in the six months ended Sept. 30, beating analysts' expectations.DCC raised its dividend by 12.5 percent to 37.17 pence.""The results reflect the continued execution of DCC's strategy to grow the business organically, deliver a very strong cash flow performance and redeploy capital at attractive rates of return,"" AJ Bell Investment director Russ Mould said.

1004,"  MILAN Eni on Friday finalised plans to develop Mozambique's Coral South offshore gas project, part of a larger scheme that will see Italy's top energy company and partners spend an estimated $50 billion.Eni has discovered huge gas reserves in its Area 4 concession, offering Mozambique, one of the world's poorest countries, potentially lucrative liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports.The Coral South project will require the construction of six subsea wells connected to a floating production facility capable of producing more than 3.3 million tonnes of LNG per year, Eni said.Friday's approval by Eni's board of directors clears the way for final investment decision (FID) on the deep-water Coral South project once Eni's partners also approve it and financing has been underwritten.     Mozambican authorities approved the project's development plan in February and Eni has said it expects FID this year. Last month Eni signed a 20-year deal to supply BP with LNG from the project.    The Coral South field, discovered in May 2012, contains about 450 billion cubic meters (16 tcf) of gas in place.    Overall reserves discovered in Mozambique's Rovuma Basin in recent years amount to some 85 tcf, making it one of the largest finds in a decade with enough gas to supply Germany, Britain, France and Italy for nearly two decades.     Eni is the operator of Area 4 and holds a 50 percent indirect stake held through Eni East Africa, which owns a 70 percent stake in Area 4. Galp Energia, KOGAS and Mozambique's state energy firm ENH each own 10 percent.    China's CNPC owns a 20 percent indirect interest in Area 4 through Eni East Africa.

1006,"   By Ahmad Ghaddar and Ahmed Rasheed | LONDON/BAGHDAD  LONDON/BAGHDAD Iraq would have to compensate international oil companies for limits placed on their production, according to industry sources and documents seen by Reuters, further reducing the prospect it will join any OPEC deal to curb the group's output.The compensation - stipulated in contracts - would compound the financial hit of losing much-needed revenue from crude sales, if the cash-strapped country were to yield to OPEC entreaties to curtail national production.OPEC member Iraq pays developers a fixed dollar-denominated fee for every barrel of oil produced in the south of the country - home to its biggest reserves - under technical service contracts agreed between the international firms and the state-owned South Oil Company (SOC).""Immediately after (an) SOC notice of ... production curtailment, the parties shall agree ... a mechanism to promptly fully compensate (the) contractor as soon as possible,"" according to an excerpt of the contract the ministry signed with BP in 2009 for the company to develop the 20-billion-barrel Rumaila field.The compensation, according to the excerpt seen by Reuters, ""may include, amongst other things, a revised field production schedule or an extension to the term or payment of all or part lost income to contractor"".Britain's BP declined to comment.The same clause also applies to other fields covered by the technical service contracts in the south, including fields being developed by Anglo-Dutch firm Shell, U.S. major Exxon Mobil and Italy's Eni, according to industry sources. A Shell spokeswoman said it did not comment on contracts. Exxon declined to comment and Eni did not immediately reply to a request for comment. A senior oil official with SOC told Reuters the country would not have to worry about curtailment clauses because it had no plans to limit production.  ""On the contrary, we're encouraging the foreign companies to raise production as much as they can,"" said the official, who declined to be named as they are not authorized to speak publicly.'EVERY DOLLAR NEEDED' The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed in Algiers in late September to limit its collective output to 32.5-33 million barrels per day (bpd). The group's production hit a record 33.64 million bpd in October.   Iraq has asked to be exempted from output curbs, arguing it is still trying to regain market share lost when sanctions were imposed in the 1990s during the Saddam Hussein era, and that it needs to keep up a costly battle against Islamic State.""OPEC must submit to the fact that Iraq must stay away from any possible output cut deal because the country is in the middle of a tough war and every single dollar is needed to keep it standing on its feet,"" a senior government official close to Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi told Reuters.Iraq put its output at 4.77 million bpd in October and said it would not go back to below 4.7 million bpd.""Not for OPEC, not for anybody else,"" said Falah al-Amri, Iraq's OPEC governor and head of the country's state marketer SOMO. There is, however, no certainty over how the discussions will play out at an OPEC meeting on Nov. 30. As a consequence, the Iraqi oil ministry and oil companies will not be able to finalize their 2017 spending plans until after the meeting, to have enough clarity on what route Iraq will take on its near-term production ambitions, an industry source told Reuters.  Iraq has been making great efforts to ensure it pays its dues to oil firms promptly and oil minister Jabar Ali al-Luaibi has made boosting production in the country a priority. ""[Iraq] is one of the countries in the region that doesn't have large foreign reserves, so will want to continue to maximize its revenue,"" said Jessica Brewer, Middle East upstream oil analyst at UK-based consultancy Wood Mackenzie.She added that while most Middle Eastern OPEC members had all or most of their production operated by national oil companies, Iraq was one of the few that relied on international oil companies for the majority of its output.

1007,"  NEW YORK Exxon Mobil's giant oil refinery in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, was operating at planned rates on Wednesday after a fire Tuesday, according to a person familiar with the plant's operations.The person said all refinery units except for the compressor where the fire occurred are operating normally. The refinery is the fourth-largest in the United States, with capacity to refine 502,500 bpd in crude oil.The fire broke out in a compressor associated with an 18,750-bpd alkylation unit, the source said. Five people were preparing the compressor for restart following repair work, people familiar with the plant's operations said.Four people remained in critical condition after the fire, according to Baton Rouge General Hospital.  The fire started as the chemical isobutane was being put into a line associated with the compressor to prepare for start-up. Multiple compressors are tied to the alkylation unit, the person said, so that the alkylation unit can continue to function even when the compressor is shut. This alkylation unit produces high-octane components that go into premium gasoline and chemicals. The fire does not curtail the refinery's ability to produce gasoline, diesel or other fuels, the person said. Exxon said it was investigating the cause of the incident and did not comment on the status of the refinery.  Exxon said the fire at the plant was extinguished Tuesday at about 4 p.m. and the company had accounted for all staff at the refinery.
