1,"   By Olivia Oran and Arno Schuetze and Soyoung Kim | NEW YORK/FRANKFURT  NEW YORK/FRANKFURT Baxter International Inc is exploring a sale of its vaccines business, according to people familiar with the matter, the latest healthcare company to look at divesting non-core assets to focus on key strengths.The medical equipment and pharmaceuticals company is working with Goldman Sachs Group to find a buyer for the unit and has reached out to potentially interested parties including private equity firms, the people said on Wednesday, asking not to be named because the matter is not public.The Baxter unit, which includes vaccines for meningitis C and tick-borne encephalitis as well as collaborations for the development of seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccines, had 2013 sales of close to $300 million according to regulatory filings.It could not be learned how much the business could fetch in a sale, as the deliberation is at an early stage and Baxter has yet to send out detailed financial information to potential buyers, the people added. Shares of Baxter were 2.3 percent higher at $69.93 on the New York Stock Exchange after gaining nearly 3.5 percent earlier on Wednesday.Representatives for Baxter did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Goldman Sachs declined to comment.The vaccines business, which is part of Baxter's $6.5 billion BioScience segment, is profitable but the company has determined it is not core, one person said. Deerfield, Illinois-based Baxter makes medical devices, pharmaceuticals and biotechnology products, focusing on areas including hemophilia, immune disorders and infectious diseases.It divides its operations between the BioScience division, which makes products including plasma-based proteins to treat hemophilia, and a Medical Products division. The medical products unit makes equipment used to inject fluids and drugs and had 2013 sales of nearly $8.7 billion. Baxter is yet another example of large healthcare companies seeking to sell or spin off smaller divisions so they can focus on their mainstay products and allocate capital better. They have shown a new willingness to consider whether other companies may be better owners for certain assets.Novartis AG is taking a hard look at its sub-scale businesses -- animal health, vaccines and over-the-counter medicines -- for a potential divestiture, chief executive Joe Jimenez told Reuters last week, adding that at least one of the three is not expected to make the cut.Merck & Co Inc is also in talks with several companies about selling its consumer healthcare business, a deal that could value the unit at between $10 billion and $12 billion, Reuters previously reported.(Reporting by Olivia Oran, Soyoung Kim in New York and Arno Schuetze in Frankfurt; editing by Andrew Hay)",2014-03-26,BAX,"Wed Mar 26, 2014 | 12:46pm EDT",Baxter explores sale of its vaccines business -sources,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-baxter-intl-sale-idUSBREA2P1CT20140326?type=companyNews
2,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, March 27 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has placed Baxter International Inc.'s  (Baxter; NYSE: BAX) long- and short-term ratings on Rating Watch Negative. The  action follows the company's announcement that it plans to spin off its  BioScience business.  A full list of the company's ratings follows at the end of  this press release.  The ratings apply to approximately $9.11 billion of debt outstanding at Dec. 31,  2013. KEY RATING DRIVERS --Baxter announced today that it intends to spin off its BioScience business to  existing shareholders in a tax-free distribution. The company estimates that it  will complete the BioScience separation in mid-2015. The proposed spinoff  appears fairly straightforward in terms of the company's franchises, with the  exception of the BioSurgery, which will be moved to the Medical Products  business from the BioScience business. --Fitch believes the split makes strategic sense as the two business segments  generally service different end markets. The Medical Products business primarily  serves acute and non-acute care provider settings, while the BioScience business  mostly works with individual physicians or physician practices, with a  particular focus on hematologists. --The Bioscience spin will clearly result in a post-spin, legacy Baxter that is  smaller in both scale and product breadth. In addition, the Medical Products  business operates with lower margins than the BioScience business, although it  also has lower capital expenditure requirements. Fitch believes the more narrow  focus of legacy Baxter will drive a degree of improved operational efficiency  and optimal capital allocation.  --Baxter's post-spin capital structure relative to its operating profile will be  the major determinant of the company's ultimate credit rating. Fitch also  recognizes the somewhat offsetting effects of a less diversified product  portfolio and a more efficient, end-user-focused business model. --Fitch will resolve the Rating Watch near, or at the time of the spin when it  has greater certainty relating to the profitability, cash generation potential  and capital structure of post-spin legacy Baxter. In addition, Fitch does not  expect Baxter to engage in any major transactions as it prepares for the  separation of the two businesses. GAMBRO ACQUISITION STRATEGICALLY SOUND Baxter acquired Gambro AB on Sept. 6, 2013 for approximately $3.9 billion from  private owners. Fitch believes the transaction is strategically sound, given  Baxter's operating focus on the hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis segments.  The Gambro acquisition will enable Baxter to expand both its renal portfolio  (particularly in hemodialysis) offering and its geographic reach. While Baxter's  $300 million synergies target appears reasonable, in Fitch's view there is  integration risk with a transaction of this size.   INTERMEDIATE-TERM LEVERAGE TO REMAIN HIGH Baxter funded the acquisition with approximately $1 billion of international  cash balances and $3.5 billion of new debt issuance. Fitch expects pro forma  post-acquisition leverage will remain between 1.8x-2.1x for at least 24 months,  leaving the company very little financial flexibility at its current 'A' credit  rating. However, Fitch believes Baxter will reduce leverage to 1.5x-1.6x by  year-end 2015 through increased profitability and debt reduction of roughly $1  billion.  CONTINUED OPERATIONAL STABILITY Fitch expects BAX to generate 3%-5% organic growth in nearly all of its business  segments through 2015, despite a challenging economic environment. While demand  for the company's products is relatively reliable, revenues are modestly  sensitive to the macroeconomic environment through reimbursement rates (pricing)  and, to a lesser extent, utilization. Fitch expects that the commercializing of  pipeline products will also provide support for longer-term growth and margin  stability.  POSITIVE BUT LOWER FREE CASH FLOW IN INTERMEDIATE TERM Fitch expects that BAX will generate more than $3.2 billion in cash flow from  operations during 2014, with continued increases in the longer term. Operational  cash flow in 2014 should be sufficient to fund approximately $1.4 billion-$1.5  billion of capital expenditures and roughly $1 billion of dividends. Fitch  expects capital expenditures will decline to a more normalized $1.2 billion-$1.3  billion by 2015, once the building of the Georgia plasma facility is largely  completed.  ACQUISITIVE POSTURE TO PERSIST OVER LONG TERM  Fitch expects targeted acquisitions will remain a core element of Baxter's  long-term growth strategy, using cash balances and incremental debt to fund  future transactions. Fitch believes the company will focus on platforms that  provide enhancements or adjacencies to its existing portfolio. However, Fitch  does not expect Baxter to pursue any major transactions prior to the mid-2015  spinoff of the BioScience business. In addition, Baxter's flexibility within the  'A' rating category to pursue leveraging acquisitions will be constrained during  the next two to three years owing to its currently stressed leverage.  ADEQUATE LIQUIDITY AND MANAGEABLE LEVERAGE/DEBT MATURITIES Free cash flow (FCF) for the latest 12 months (LTM) ended Dec. 31, 2013 was  approximately $650 million. Cash on hand was roughly $2.7 billion, and BAX had  no borrowings on its $1.5 billion credit facility maturing in June 2015 and $289  million available on its $413 million credit facility maturing in December 2014.  Total debt was roughly $9.2 billion, and resulting leverage was 3.01x. The  company has approximately $1 billion of long-term debt maturing in 2014, $810  million in 2015, $1.10 billion in 2016 and $639 million in 2017. RATING SENSITIVITIES Fitch will resolve the Negative Watch near, or at the time of the spinoff when  it has greater clarity as to the profitability, cash generation potential and  capital structure of post-spin legacy Baxter. In addition, Fitch expects that  reported leverage for Baxter near the time of the spin will be significantly  lower than the 3.01x it was at Dec. 31, 2013. Fitch placed the following ratings for Baxter on Negative Watch: --Long-term IDR 'A'; --Short-term IDR 'F1'; --Senior unsecured notes 'A';  --Bank credit facility 'A';  --Commercial paper 'F1'.

12,"  (Updates with background, sales forecast)By Toni ClarkeMarch 28 Biogen Idec Inc has won U.S. approval for its long-acting hemophilia B treatment Alprolix, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said on Friday.Hemophilia B is a rare, inherited disorder in which a person's blood does not clot properly, which can lead to prolonged bleeding and bruising. It affects about 4,000 people in the United States and 25,000 worldwide. Alprolix is a bioengineered version of the blood coagulation factor IX, a protein needed for normal blood clotting. Biogen is developing the drug in partnership with Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB. It received approval in Canada a week ago.Hemophilia drugs in general must be infused two to three times a week to prevent bleeding episodes. Biogen's drug needs to be administered once a week or once every 10 to 14 days. The company is also developing a long-lasting drug, Eloctate, for Hemophilia A, a more common form of the disease, that affects about 20,000 people in the United States. Patients with hemophilia A lack or have reduced levels of coagulation factor VIII. Current treatments for hemophilia B generate about $1 billion a year, according to Biogen. The market for hemophilia A therapies is worth about $6 billion.Eloctate would compete with Baxter International Inc's drug Advate. Baxter is seeking to develop its own long-acting version but Biogen is expected to be first to the market.Alprolix is expected to generate sales of $286 million by 2019, according to Thomson Reuters data. Eloctate is expected to generate sales of $1.1 billion.

13,"   By Lawrence Hurley | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The U.S. Supreme Court declined on Monday to hear an appeal filed by healthcare company Baxter International Inc over a patent dispute with rival Fresenius Medical Care AG & Co.The court's action means a July 2013 ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit remains intact. That ruling threw out a judgment of almost $24 million that Baxter had won over its patent relating to a dialysis machine.The appeals court nixed the judgment in light of a decision by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, which ruled in a separate proceeding that the patent was invalid years after it was issued.

Baxter said in March that it planned to spin off its biotechnology operations into a publicly traded company by the middle of next year and focus on its core medical technology business.The company also tightened its full-year adjusted profit forecast on Thursday to $5.10-$5.20 per share from $5.05-$5.25, leaving its midpoint unchanged.Analysts said Baxter's reluctance to raise its full-year forecast despite beating expectations this quarter stemmed from impending generic competition for two of its high-margin drugs, Suprane and Cyclophosphamide.Baxter's stock was marginally down about 0.7 percent at $77.10 on Thursday. The company also raised the forecast for its hemophilia franchise, despite the potential for competition from Biogen Idec Inc's long-acting hemophilia A treatment Eloctate, which the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved in June.Baxter is currently developing a long-acting version of Advate, but Eloctate is slated to hit the markets sooner.""We view the strong results and higher guidance in hemophilia as a sign of increased confidence from management in the company's ability to defend its leadership position in this core franchise,"" Piper Jaffray analyst Matt Miksic said.

19,"   By Toni Clarke | Washington  Washington Advisors to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration will meet on Thursday to discuss the relative risks and benefits of Baxter International Inc's experimental treatment for certain hereditary disorders of the immune system.The FDA on Wednesday posted its preliminary assessment of the data on its website. The agency is seeking guidance from a panel of outside experts on whether the benefits of the product outweigh the risks. The FDA is not obligated to follow the recommendations of its advisors, but typically does so.Baxter's therapy, HyQvia, is designed to treat primary immunodeficiency diseases. These are genetic disorders in which certain cells of the immune system are missing, leading to a infections, recurrent pneumonia and abscesses of the organs.HyQvia combines immune globulin (IG), a substance made from human blood plasma, and one vial of recombinant human hyaluronidase, or rHuPH20, a genetically engineered enzyme that increases absorption of the IG and allows it to be used less frequently than traditional products. The FDA declined to approve the product in 2012, and asked for more information about its possible impact after some patients in a clinical trial developed antibodies against rHuPH20, which Baxter licensed from Halozyme Therapeutics Inc. HyQvia was approved in Europe in 2013.Baxter's data showed the elevated antibodies, which the immune system produces to fight foreign bodies, had no clinical impact on patients. However, the FDA was concerned about the theoretical potential of long-term exposure to the product to  cause inflammation of the brain and bowel, as well as fertility problems.""The risk-benefit considerations are very different for HyQvia compared to other IG products because the main immunogenetic component of concern (rHuPH20) is not a life-saving therapeutic,"" the FDA's report noted. The benefit of the product is primarily one of convenience. Eun Yang, an analyst at Jefferies LLC, said in a research note that without therapeutic advantages in a well-supplied market, the ""FDA does not have to take risks of approving HyQvia.""Even if approved, Yang added, its commercial potential would likely be very limited given the concerns about male fertility. He estimated that peak U.S. and European sales would reach $740 million, translating into royalty revenue for Halozyme of $37 million. Existing immune globulin therapies are given intravenously once every three to four weeks in a hospital, or by injection at home once every one to two weeks.

These are genetic disorders in which certain cells of the immune system are missing, leading to infections, recurrent pneumonia and abscesses of the organs.The FDA is not obliged to follow the advice of its advisory panels but typically does so.The agency had raised concerns that some patients developed high levels of antibodies to a component of the treatment. Antibodies are used by the immune system to fight off viruses and other foreign substances in the blood.Baxter's data showed the elevated antibodies had no clinical impact on patients. The FDA said there is, nonetheless, a possibility that long-term exposure to the product could cause inflammation of the brain and bowel, as well as fertility problems. Panelists said the risk remains theoretical, and they voted against requiring routine monitoring of antibody levels. They also voted against restricting availability of the product. The FDA had asked whether certain subgroups of patients, such as pregnant women, male children and patients with certain inflammatory conditions, should be excluded.The votes follow a far more cautious assessment of HyQvia by FDA reviewers on Tuesday.Michael Weinstein, an analyst at J.P. Morgan, lowered his earnings estimate for Baxter on Thursday, before the panel meeting, to reflect the company's divestiture of its vaccines business and an assumption that HyQvia ""fails to reach the US market following our negative read of the FDA panel documents."" Baxter's shares were down 1.3 percent at $75.08 in afternoon trading following the vote.HyQvia, which was approved in Europe in 2013, combines immune globulin (IG), a substance made from human blood plasma, and recombinant human hyaluronidase, or rHuPH20, a genetically engineered enzyme that increases absorption of the IG and allows it to be used less frequently than traditional products.The FDA declined to approve the product in 2012, and asked for more information about its possible impact on fertility after some patients in a clinical trial developed antibodies against rHuPH20, which Baxter licensed from Halozyme Therapeutics Inc.

HyQvia is designed to be injected at home every three to four weeks.Derrick Sung, an analyst at Sanford Bernstein, said he believes HyQvia will be a ""significant growth driver"" for Baxter.

The company plans to apply for U.S. marketing approval for the drug before the end of the year and said it would begin another late-stage study to test BAX 855 in previously treated patients under the age of 12.Baxter raised the forecast for its hemophilia franchise in July, despite the potential for competition from Biogen Idec Inc's long-acting treatment Eloctate, which the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved in June.

42,"  * Olaparib recommended for treatment of ovarian cancer* Drug also being tested in breast and gastric cancers* AstraZeneca sees potential sales of $2 billion a year* EMA also backs new drugs from Pfizer, Baxter, Clinuvel   (Adds AstraZeneca comment, further details)By Ben HirschlerLONDON, Oct 24 AstraZeneca's cancer drug pipeline received a boost on Friday, as European regulators recommended approval of an experimental medicine against ovarian cancer.The green light from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for olaparib, or Lynparza, is welcome news since the product hit a road bump in June when a U.S. panel voted against its accelerated approval. AstraZeneca has flagged the medicine as a potential $2 billion-a-year seller.Olaparib blocks an enzyme involved in cell repair and is designed for patients with certain hereditary gene mutations. It also has promise in treating other cancers, opening up a substantial market opportunity.""We are committed to investigating the full potential of olaparib and have a number of studies underway in multiple tumour types including breast and gastric cancer,"" said Briggs Morrison, AstraZeneca's chief medical officer. The treatment is expected to be the first drug in the so-called PARP inhibitor class to reach the market in Europe.The EMA said its committee of experts on new drugs also recommended approval of Pfizer's Duavive for oestrogen deficiency, Baxter International's Rixubis for haemophilia and Clinuvel's Scenesse for phototoxicity.Recommendations for marketing approval by the European Medicine Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) are normally endorsed by the European Commission within a couple of months. An AstraZeneca spokeswoman said a final decision on olaparib's approval was now expected in January 2015. The British company also hopes to hear back from regulators on the approvability of the medicine in the United States by Jan. 3.Cancer medicine is central to AstraZeneca's claims that it has a strong independent future, after fending off a $118 billion takeover bid from Pfizer in May.As part of its defence, the British drugmaker set out a bullish set of forecasts for its drug pipeline and predicted that group sales would climb 75 percent by 2023.Most interest is focused on the company's rapidly developing line-up of experimental immunotherapy treatments, which boost the immune system's ability to fight cancer. Research presented at a cancer congress in Madrid last month suggests AstraZeneca is in a strong position in this field.Shares in AstraZeneca pared losses by 1130 GMT to stand 0.6 percent down on the day, after falling as much as 2 percent earlier on news of an $11 billion share buyback plan by Pfizer.Some investors saw the move as reducing the likelihood that Pfizer would renew its pursuit of AstraZeneca, although analysts cautioned against reading too much into the U.S. company's decision to continue its share repurchase plans.

Other approved hemophilia B treatments include Baxter's Rixubis, Pfizer Inc's Benefix and CSL Behring Ltd's  Mononine.Baxter's shares were up about 1 percent at $69.66 in early afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

47,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, March 20 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has maintained Baxter International  Inc.'s (Baxter; NYSE: BAX) long- and short-term ratings on Rating Watch  Negative. Fitch placed the company's ratings on Negative Watch in March 2014  when Baxter announced it plans to spin off its BioScience business. A full list  of the company's ratings follows at the end of this press release.  The ratings apply to approximately $9.21 billion of debt outstanding at Dec. 31,  2014. KEY RATING DRIVERS --Baxter's anticipated spinoff its BioScience business (near July 1, 2015) to  existing shareholders appears fairly straightforward in terms of the company's  franchises. However, Baxter's post-spin capital structure and operating profile  will be the major determinant of the company's ultimate credit rating.  --With leverage (total debt/EBITDA) currently at 2.4 times (x), Baxter will  likely enter the spinoff with leverage above the 1.7x, which Fitch considers  more consistent with an 'A' credit rating for this company.  --Fitch believes the split makes strategic sense as the two business segments  generally service different end markets. The Medical Products business primarily  serves acute and non-acute care provider settings, while the BioScience business  mostly works with individual physicians or physician practices, with a  particular focus on hematologists. --The Bioscience spin will decrease Baxter's scale and product breadth. However,  Fitch believes the more narrow focus of legacy Baxter will help to drive  improved operational efficiency and optimal capital allocation.  --The integration of the Gambro acquisition is essentially complete and Fitch  believes Baxter is on track to generate $300 million in annual synergies by  2017. --Fitch anticipates that Baxter will maintain a stable operating profile in the  intermediate term, driven by moderate organic growth, relatively stable legacy  margins and consistently positive FCF. --Fitch will resolve the Rating Watch near or at the time of the spin when it  has greater certainty regarding the profitability, cash generation potential and  capital structure of post-spin legacy Baxter. REMAINING OPERATING PROFILE AND CAPITAL STRUCTURE WILL DETERMINE RATING Legacy Baxter post-spin will operate as a more narrowly focused and lower margin  business. Nevertheless, Fitch believes the company will still generate long-term  organic growth, relatively stable margins and consistently positive free cash  flow, and the company's post-spin operating profile and capital structure will  ultimately determine the company's credit rating. Fitch expects EBITDA margins  will range between 18% - 21% and organic revenue growth will be in the low- to  mid-single-digit range. However, Fitch is currently less certain about the level  of normalized FCF and the degree of leverage with which BAX will operate. LEVERAGE HIGH FOR CURRENT RATING Current leverage is high for BAX's 'A' rating, as the company used debt to  finance the expansion of its plasma manufacturing facility in Covington, Georgia  and its September 2013 acquisition of Gambro. While Fitch views both as positive  strategic pursuits, but an additional $3.75 billion in debt was incurred to  finance these initiatives. The back-end loaded nature of the  operational/financial benefits from increased plasma product sales and  integration synergies from Gambro further stressed near-term leverage. Fitch  will evaluate whether there is a pathway for deleveraging through the allocation  of debt to the bioscience division, improvement in EBITDA and possible debt  pay-downs during the forecast period. DIVERSIFICATION VERSUS FOCUS The Bioscience spin will result in a post-spin, legacy Baxter that is smaller in  both scale and product breadth. In addition, the Medical Products business  operates with lower margins than the BioScience business, although it also has  lower capital expenditure requirements. Fitch believes the more narrow focus of  legacy Baxter will help drive improved operational efficiency and optimal  capital allocation.  GAMBRO INTEGRATION ESSENTIALLY COMPLETE Baxter has essentially completed the integration of Gambro AB, which it acquired  in September 2013 for approximately $3.9 billion. Fitch expects Baxter will  achieve $300 million in annual synergies by 2017. The acquired Gambro business  enabled Baxter to expand both its renal portfolio (particularly in hemodialysis)  offering and its geographic reach. Baxter funded the acquisition with  approximately $1 billion of international cash balances and $3.5 billion of new  debt issuance, resulting in a significant increase in leverage. CONTINUED OPERATIONAL STABILITY Fitch expects BAX to generate 3%-4% organic growth in nearly all of its business  segments through 2015, despite a challenging economic environment. While demand  for the company's products is relatively reliable, revenues are modestly  sensitive to the macroeconomic environment through reimbursement rates (pricing)  and, to a lesser extent, utilization. Fitch expects that the commercializing of  pipeline products will also provide support for longer-term growth and margin  stability. ACQUISITIVE POSTURE TO PERSIST OVER LONG TERM Fitch expects targeted acquisitions will remain a core element of Baxter's  long-term growth strategy, using cash balances and incremental debt to fund  future transactions. Fitch believes the company will focus on platforms that  provide enhancements or adjacencies to its existing portfolio. Baxter currently  has no flexibility within the 'A' rating category to pursue leveraging  acquisitions. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions incorporated into Fitch's Negative Ratings Watch for  Baxter include: --BioScience spinoff will occur near July 1, 2015; --Low to mid-single-digit organic revenue growth; --Post-spin Baxter to operate with lower margins due to revenue mix;  --Positive, but lower FCF post spin; --Capital structure, cash deployment priorities and a more detailed view of the  operating profile of post-spin Baxter still to be determined.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Fitch will resolve the Negative Watch near or at the time of the spinoff when it  has greater clarity as to the profitability, cash generation potential and  capital structure of post-spin legacy Baxter.  Fitch has maintained the following ratings for Baxter on Rating Watch Negative: --Long-term IDR 'A'; --Short-term IDR 'F1'; --Senior unsecured notes 'A';  --Bank credit facility 'A';  --Commercial paper 'F1'.

55,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, May 29 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has downgraded Baxter International Inc.'s  (Baxter) long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) by two notches to 'BBB+' and  assigned a Stable Rating Outlook. In addition, Fitch downgraded the company's  short-term IDR to 'F2' from 'F1'. Baxter had approximately $10 billion in outstanding debt at March 31, 2015. A  full list of Fitch's ratings actions follows at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS --The 'BBB+' rating reflects Baxter's business profile pro forma for the planned  spin-off of the company's biosciences business. Fitch believes the split makes  strategic sense as the two business segments focus on different end markets. --The Bioscience spin will decrease Baxter's scale and product breadth. However,  Fitch believes the narrower focus of legacy Baxter will help to drive improved  operational efficiency and optimal capital allocation over the longer term. --Fitch expects Baxter to reduce leverage post spin, from a pro forma 2.7 times  (x) to roughly 2.0x by the end of 2016. The primary source of this deleveraging  will be debt pay down using proceeds from the spin off.  --In addition to the effects of the spin-off transaction, pro forma leverage is  elevated due to the lingering effects of the Gambro acquisition, integration of  which is essentially complete. Fitch believes Baxter is on track to generate  roughly $300 million in annual synergies by 2017 through reducing costs and  leveraging scale. --Post spin, Baxter's operating profile benefits from good organic growth  prospects in its primary business lines, with the renal segment aided by the  addition of the Gambro product lines.  --The spin will initially have a negative influence on operating margins and  cash flow generation, both because of cost dis-synergies and the lower margins  of the remaining business lines. Fitch forecasts Baxter to mitigate these  effects through focusing on reducing administrative costs, as well as driving  growth of higher margin products. --Expected cuts in capital expenditures and the dividend will somewhat offset  the spin-related headwinds to FCF, and Fitch expects it to be sufficient to fund  targeted acquisitions and/or moderate share repurchases. --Baxter will likely remain acquisitive, but Fitch believes the company will  focus on targeted acquisitions that deepen its existing product portfolio or  adds adjacencies. Diversification Versus Focus: The Bioscience spin will result in a post-spin  Baxter that is smaller in both scale and product breadth. In addition, the  Medical Products business operates with lower margins than the BioScience  business, although it also has lower capital expenditure requirements. Fitch  believes the narrower focus of legacy Baxter result in improved operational  efficiency and optimal capital allocation over the longer-term. Some of the  company's products and franchises will likely garner more resources to foster  growth, now that they are not competing with the higher margin bioscience  products.  Resulting Operating Profile and Capital Structure Supports 'BBB+' Rating:  Following the spin of Baxalta, Fitch expects Baxter's EBITDA margins will range  between 16% - 19%, versus about 24% pre-spin, and organic revenue growth (before  the effects of foreign exchange) will be in the low- to mid-single-digit range.  Costs associated with the spin and operating dis-synergies will be a headwind to  margins. In addition, the legacy business has lower margins than the biosciences  segment.  Although Fitch expects the company to focus on improving operating margins, the  expected deleveraging of the capital structure relies much more heavily on debt  paydown than on EBITDA growth, which reduces the risk to the credit profile of  the margin headwinds created by the spin-off transaction.  Immediately after the spinoff, Fitch forecasts pro forma leverage (unadjusted  gross debt to EBITDA) of 2.7x, about 0.3x higher than the 2.4x level at the end  of 2014. The company's plans to use the majority of proceeds raised through the  spin-off to reduce debt is a key factor supporting the credit profile.  Initially, Fitch expects Baxter to use the $4 billion cash distribution from  Baxalta to fund the tender of certain outstanding debt. The liquidation of a  retained 19.5% stake in Baxalta over the next 18 months will provide further  opportunities to pay down debt.  After the initial deleveraging is accomplished post the spin-off, Fitch expects  leverage of 1.7x - 2.1x for Baxter, potentially increasing to around 2.5x from  acquisitions or significant manufacturing capacity expansions, with FCF  providing a source of deleveraging post transaction-related jumps in leverage.  Gambro Integration Essentially Complete: Baxter has essentially completed the  integration of Gambro AB, which it acquired in Sept. 2013 for approximately $3.9  billion. Fitch expects Baxter will achieve roughly $300 million in annual  synergies by 2017 through reducing costs as well as leveraging scale. The  acquired Gambro business enabled Baxter to expand both its renal portfolio  (particularly in hemodialysis) offering and its geographic reach. Baxter funded  the acquisition with approximately $1 billion of international cash balances and  $3.5 billion of new debt issuance, resulting in a significant increase in  leverage. Continued Operational Stability: Fitch expects Baxter to generate 2%-3% organic  growth in nearly all of its business segments through 2015, although reported  growth will likely face significant foreign exchange headwinds. While demand for  the company's products is relatively reliable, revenues are modestly sensitive  to the macroeconomic environment through reimbursement rates (pricing) and, to a  lesser extent, utilization. Fitch expects that the commercializing of pipeline  products will also provide support for longer-term growth and margin stability. Positive But Lower Free Cash Flow: Fitch expects that legacy Baxter will  generate roughly $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion in annual pro forma cash flow from  operations during 2015-2016. Operational cash flow in should be sufficient to  fund approximately $750 million to $850 million of capital expenditures and  approximately $280 million to $300 million in dividends.  Acquisitive Posture to Persist Over Long Term: Fitch expects targeted  acquisitions will remain a core element of Baxter's long-term growth strategy,  using cash balances and incremental debt to fund future transactions. Fitch  believes the company will focus on platforms that provide enhancements or  adjacencies to its existing portfolio. Until Baxter executes on its plans to  reduce leverage following the spin-off, there is limited flexibility for  leveraging transaction at the 'BBB+' rating level. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case for Baxter include: --Low-single-digit reported revenue growth with organic growth in all business  segments being partially offset by negative foreign exchange rate effects.  --Following an initial drop of about 800 bps post spin, Fitch expects a  gradually improving operating EBITDA margin, particularly as Baxter drives a mix  shift to higher margin products and improves operational efficiency. --Pro forma annual cash dividends of roughly $300 million and gradually  increasing thereafter. --Pro forma annual FCF (cash flow from operations minus capital expenditures  minus dividends) of $200 million to $300 million through 2016 and meaningfully  increasing thereafter. --Targeted acquisitions with no strategic, transformative transactions. --Moderate share repurchases to offset dilution as the firm deleverages. --Leverage to decline to around 2.0x during the next 18 months as Baxter applies  the majority of proceeds from the spin off transaction to debt paydown. RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: While Fitch does not anticipate an upgrade in the near to intermediate  term, a positive rating action could result from Baxter committing to and  operating with leverage consistently and significantly stronger than 2.0x, while  maintaining stable operations sustained with positive organic growth and solid  FCF. Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a  Negative Outlook or one notch downgrade to 'BBB' include: --Debt above 2.5x EBITDA without the prospect for timely deleveraging. In the  near-term, the most likely driver of this is scenario in which Baxter does not  use a significant amount of the proceeds from the spin off to paydown debt.  --Steady operational improvement during the intermediate term, including organic  revenue growth, meaningful margin improvement and significant growth in FCF.  Improvements are expected to be driven by increased market penetration, new  product introductions, mix-shift to higher margin products and solid cost  control. LIQUIDITY Adequate Liquidity: Baxter experienced a $357 million drain in FCF during the  LTM period ended March 31, 2015 due to a significant increase in working capital  requirements and capital expenditures, to support product launches and expanding  plasma manufacturing capacity, respectively. However, Fitch anticipates that  legacy Baxter will be FCF positive on an annual basis during the forecast  period. At March 31, 2015, cash on hand was roughly $3.0 billion, and Baxter had  full availability on its credit facilities, amounting to $3.0 billion, which  will be reduced to USD 1.5 billion and EUR 150 million at the time of the  Baxalta spin-off.  Manageable Debt Maturities: Total debt was roughly $10 billion at March 31,  2015, and resulting leverage was 2.7x. Fitch believes Baxter's debt maturities  are manageable, with roughly $600 million of long-term debt maturing in 2015,  $1.1 billion in 2016, $500 million in 2017 and $1.25 billion in 2018 (excluding  the completion of any tenders). FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has downgraded Baxter's rating as follows: --Long-term IDR to 'BBB+' from 'A'; --Unsecured bank facility to 'BBB+' from 'A'; --Unsecured notes to 'BBB+' from 'A'; --Short-term IDR to 'F2' from 'F1'; --Commercial Paper to 'F2' from 'F1'.

57,"   By Paul Sandle | LONDON  LONDON Drugmaker Shire (SHP.L) said on Tuesday it was seeking to buy Baxalta BXLT.N, a company spun-off by Baxter International (BAX.N) last month, for $30 billion to forge the leading global specialist in rare diseases.The London-listed group went public with its approach after the U.S. firm turned it down during private talks last month.Baxalta rebuffed the offer on Tuesday and said in a statement that Shire's unsolicited offer significantly undervalued the company.Shire's all-share offer values each Baxalta share at $45.23, based on Aug. 3 market prices. Baxalta's shares closed up nearly 12 percent at $37.10. Shire's stock closed down about 6 percent.The Illinois-based firm, which has a staff of around 16,000, develops biotech treatments for rare blood conditions, cancers and immune system disorders. It had proforma revenue of $6 billion in 2014. Baxalta offers Shire a promising range of new products to complement its growing portfolio of high-priced treatments for rare or ""orphan"" diseases, analysts said. But there is no guarantee that Shire, itself the target of a failed takeover in 2014, will land its prey.""Shire may need to go hostile and success rates of pharma hostile bids are low,"" said Leerink analyst Jason Gerberry. Shire said it would create an unrivalled rare diseases champion with product sales of around $20 billion by 2020 and double-digit percent annual sales growth.The move is the latest in a wave of mergers and acquisitions in the healthcare sector since the start of 2014, stretching from large drugmakers buying up smaller rivals to consolidation among makers of generic medicines and tie-ups between insurers. Shire's offer of 0.1687 Shire American depositary receipts per share, which represents a premium of 36 percent over Baxalta's stock price on Aug. 3, would give the U.S. firm's shareholders about 37 percent of the combined group.Shire Chief Executive Flemming Ornskov said he had gone public with its plan, which it first proposed privately last month, after Baxalta's board declined to engage in substantive discussions. He declined to talk about tactics on Baxalta or discuss whether he was prepared to go hostile, but said the deal offered both tax and revenue synergies and would be good for both sets of shareholders. TAX RATES  Ornskov said he had tried to engage with Baxalta CEO Ludwig Hantson since early July. Apart from a brief ""cordial"" meeting on July 10, however, there had been no meaningful interaction, he added.""As a result, you have left us with no choice but to make our proposal known to your shareholders. We believe they deserve an opportunity to consider it,"" the Shire boss wrote in an Aug. 4 letter to Hantson.Ornskov, who expects to launch a $10 billion share buyback after any deal closes, added that it remained his strong preference to reach a negotiated agreement.Dublin-based Shire has a long history of acquisitions and only on Monday agreed to buy private eye drug company Foresight Biotherapeutics for $300 million. Other notable deals include buying New River Pharmaceuticals for $2.3 billion in 2007, Viropharma in 2013 for $4.2 billion and NPS Pharma for $5.2 billion this year.Last year Shire itself was the target of a failed $50 billion takeover attempt by AbbVie (ABBV.N), since when its shares have risen to a premium to AbbVie's offer on growing optimism for its line-up of high-priced niche medicines.The AbbVie deal unraveled after the U.S. government changed the rules on American companies domiciling overseas to take advantage of lower corporate tax rates.Shire is, however, using its relatively low tax status as a selling point on this new deal, saying a combined group would have a 16-17 percent effective tax rate by 2017, down from around 21-24 percent for Baxalta.But Ornskov told reporters the main driver was the strategic fit of the companies and the growth potential of a tie-up. ""Tax is just one part of it, it's not the main part,"" he said.Shares in Actelion ATLN.VX, which had previously been tipped as a potential target for Shire, fell 2.9 percent.

Fitch expects the  net proceeds from the issuance to be used to pay down existing debt and  short-term borrowings, as well as other general corporate purposes. Baxter had approximately $3.2 billion in outstanding debt at June 30, 2016. A  full list of Baxter's ratings follows at the end of this release. The Rating  Outlook is Stable.  KEY RATING DRIVERS --The 'BBB+' rating reflects Baxter's significant deleveraging and strong  operating performance post the spin-off of the company's biosciences business in  June 2015.  --Baxter's operating profile benefits from good organic growth prospects in its  primary business lines. --Fitch expects the company will continue to generate solid free cash flow (FCF)  and deploy capital consistent with its current rating. --Baxter will likely remain acquisitive, but Fitch believes the company will  focus on targeted acquisitions that deepen its existing product portfolio or add  adjacencies. Meaningful Deleveraging Post Spin: Baxter has reduced leverage to below 2.0x  within 12 months of the Baxalta spinoff on July 1, 2015. Immediately after the  spinoff, Fitch estimated pro forma leverage (unadjusted gross debt to forecasted  standalone EBITDA) was roughly 6x with total debt of roughly $9.2 billion.  During the next 12 months, the company reduced debt by roughly $6 billion,  funded by the $4 billion cash distribution received from Baxalta and the  disposition of its roughly 19.5% equity stake in Baxalta. On May 6, 2016, the  company contributed roughly 17 million Baxalta shares to its U.S. qualified  pension plan, reducing the unfunded liability of the benefit obligation. Continued Operational Strength: Fitch expects Baxter to generate 3%-4% organic  growth in nearly all of its business segments through the intermediate term,  although near-term reported growth will likely face some foreign exchange  headwinds. Demand for the company's products is relatively reliable, although  revenues are modestly sensitive to the macroeconomic environment through  reimbursement rates (pricing) and, to a lesser extent, utilization. Fitch  expects that the commercializing of pipeline products will also provide support  for longer-term top-line growth and incrementally increasing margins. Business Model Still Diversified: The company's business model remains fairly  diversified from both a product and geographic perspective, despite the  bioscience spinoff. Baxter has four major product-focused franchises: Renal  (accounting for 38% of total firm sales), Fluid Systems (23%), Integrated  Pharmacy Solutions (23%) and Surgical Care (13%).  The company has global reach,  manufacturing products in approximately 25 countries and selling them in  approximately 120 countries. U.S. sales account for roughly 42% of total firm  sales. Strong Cash Flow Expected: Fitch expects that Baxter will generate roughly $1.5  billion to $1.6 billion in annual pro forma cash flow from operations during  2016 driven by expected operational strength and sound working capital  management. Operational cash flow should be sufficient to fund approximately  $900 million to $1 billion of capital expenditures and approximately $250  million to $270 million in dividends.  Acquisitive Posture to Persist: Fitch expects targeted acquisitions will remain  a core element of Baxter's long-term growth strategy, using cash balances and  incremental debt to fund future transactions. Fitch believes the company will  focus on platforms that provide enhancements or adjacencies to its existing  portfolio. Fitch expects that typical leverage of 1.7x-2.1x for Baxter could  increase to around 2.5x from acquisitions or significant manufacturing capacity  expansions, with FCF providing a source of timely deleveraging.  KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case for Baxter include: --Low-single-digit reported revenue growth with organic growth in all business  segments.  --Gradually improving operating EBITDA margin, particularly as Baxter drives a  mix shift to higher margin products and improves operational efficiency. --Cash dividends gradually and consistently increasing over time. --FCF (cash flow from operations minus capital expenditures minus dividends) of  $200 million to $300 million through 2016 and meaningfully increasing  thereafter. --Targeted acquisitions with no strategic, transformative transactions. --Leverage to range between 1.8x-2.1x. RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: While Fitch does not anticipate an upgrade in the near to intermediate  term, a positive rating action could result from Baxter committing to and  operating with leverage consistently and significantly stronger than 1.7x, while  maintaining stable operations sustained with positive organic growth and solid  FCF. Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a  Negative Outlook or one notch downgrade to 'BBB' include: --Debt above 2.5x EBITDA without the prospect for timely deleveraging.  --Potential increased leverage resulting from operational stress or share  repurchases would need to be reduced more quickly than leverage from an  acquisition. LIQUIDITY Adequate Liquidity: Fitch expects Baxter to maintain adequate liquidity,  supported by its credit facilities, positive FCF and balance sheet cash. FCF was  a negative $14 million during the latest 12 months (LTM) period ended June 30,  2016, due to significant non-recurring cash charges. At June 30, 2016, cash on  hand was roughly $2.6 billion, and Baxter had full availability on its credit  facilities, amounting to USD1.5 billion and EUR150 million, both of which mature  in July 2020.  Manageable Debt Maturities: Total debt was roughly $3.2 billion at June 30,  2016, and resulting/estimated leverage was 1.93x. Fitch believes Baxter's debt  maturities are manageable, with roughly $132 million of long-term debt maturing  in 2016 (excluding $791 million of commercial paper borrowings), $144 million in  2017, $540 million in 2018 and $138 million in 2019. Fitch expects some of these  maturities to be tendered and funded with the proceeds from today's announced  issuance.   FULL LIST OF RATINGS Fitch currently rates Baxter as follows: Baxter International Inc. --Long-Term IDR 'BBB+'; --Unsecured bank facility 'BBB+'; --Unsecured notes 'BBB+'; --Short-Term IDR 'F2'; --Commercial paper 'F2'.
