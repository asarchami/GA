0,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, February 05 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed People's United  Financial, Inc.'s (PBCT) ratings at 'A-'/'F1'. The Rating Outlook has been  revised to Negative from Stable. The Outlook revision reflects PBCT's weak  earnings and increasing liquidity risk profile. A full list of rating actions  follows at the end of this press release. KEY RATING DRIVERS - IDRS, VRs, AND SENIOR DEBT The revision of PBCT's Outlook to Negative reflects the bank's weak earnings and  increasing liquidity risk profile. PBCT's loan to deposit ratio has increased to  106% percent, while the rest of the industry has typically experienced declining  loan to deposit levels. Fitch believes banks with elevated loan to deposit  ratios could experience deposit pricing pressure once Fed tapers QE and 'surge'  deposits begin to leave the banking system.  An increase in funding costs could impact PBCT's ability to generate sufficient  core earnings improvement in a normalized rate environment commensurate with its  current rating. PBCT's earnings rank amongst the bottom quartile of the peer  group. The Negative Outlook reflects Fitch's view that earnings could remain in  the bottom quartile of the group in a rising rate environment, despite PBCT's  asset sensitive balance sheet. PBCT's 'A-' rating reflects not only its current solid asset quality metrics but  also its demonstrated performance through the cycle. PBCT differentiated itself  from its peers by maintaining net charge offs well below 1% before, during and  after the great recession.  PBCT has solid capital levels. Although capital levels have been declining  through the company's share repurchase program, Fitch anticipated capital  optimization since PBCT historically operated with excess capital levels. As  such, the reductions to capital have been incorporated into Fitch's ratings for  some time. Should capital levels be managed well below its current levels,  negative ratings action could be taken.  RATING SENSITIVITIES - IDRS, VRs, AND SENIOR DEBT PBCT's ratings are sensitive to core earnings levels in a rising rate  environment. Should earnings levels continue to rank in the bottom quartile in a  rising rate environment, a ratings downgrade is possible. Fitch does not  anticipate improvements to PBCT's current rating, which ranks amongst the top of  the mid-tier banks.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES PBCT's subordinated debt issued through the Chittenden Corporation is rated one  notch below PBCT's VR . The notch differential reflects loss severity and an  assessment of increment non-performance risk.  RATING SENSITIVITIES - SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES PBCT's subordinated debt rating is sensitive to changes in PBTC's VR. The rating  sensitivities for the VR are listed above.  SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANY KEY RATING DRIVERS People's United Bank is a wholly owned subsidiary of PBCT. People's United  Bank's ratings are aligned with PBCT reflecting Fitch's view that the bank  subsidiary is core to the franchise.  SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANY RATING SENSITIVITIES People's United Bank's ratings are sensitive to changes to PBCT's VR or any  changes to Fitch's view of structural subordination between bank subsidiaries  and holding companies. Rating sensitivities for the VR are listed above.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR PBCT's Support Rating and Support Rating Floor of '5' and 'NF' reflect Fitch's  view that the company is unlikely to procure extraordinary support should such  support be needed. KEY RATING SENSITIVITIES- SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR PBCT's Support Rating and Support Rating Floor are sensitive to Fitch's  assumption around capacity to procure extraordinary support in case of need. Fitch reviewed PBCT's ratings as part of the mid-tier regional bank review. The  19 banks in today's review include: Associated Banc-Corp (ASBC), BOK Financial  Corp (BOKF), Cathay General Bancorp (CATY), City National Bancorp  (CYN),Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc (CFR), East West Bancorp, Inc.

1,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, January 30 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has downgraded People's United  Financial's (PBCT) ratings to 'BBB+/F2'. The Rating Outlook is revised to Stable  from Negative. The downgrade reflects PBCT's declining capital levels, elevated  commercial loan growth and profitability well below its rated peers.  The rating action follows a periodic review of the mid-tier regional banking  group, which includes BOK Financial Corp. (BOKF), Cathay General Bancorp (CATY),  East West Bancorp, Inc. (EWBC), First Horizon National Corp. (FHN), First  National of Nebraska, Inc. (FNNI), First Republic Bank (FRC), Fulton Financial  Corp (FULT), People's United Financial Inc. (PBCT), Synovus Financial Corp.  (SNV), TCF Financial Corp. (TCB), Webster Financial Corp. (WBS), Wintrust  Financial Corp (WTFC), and UMB Financial Corporation (UMB). Company-specific rating rationales for the other banks are published separately.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - IDRs, VRs AND SENIOR DEBT PBCT's 'BBB+' ratings continue to reflect the company's good history of  execution on its strategy, solid management team and low credit costs through  the cycle. However, Fitch has downgraded PBCT's ratings due to capital levels  declining below peer medians combined with elevated commercial loan growth and  continued earnings weakness. Fitch had previously considered capital a relative  rating strength versus peers, and to the extent capital levels were managed  down, PBCT would improve earnings and profitability. PBCT's tangible common equity ratio declined to 7.5% at year-end 2014, which is  lower than Fitch's expectation. Although capital levels are still satisfactory,  the lower capital buffers along with loan growth and relatively weak earnings no  longer compare favorably to peers rated  in the 'A-' category.  Asset quality is the primary ratings strength for the institution. The company  experienced lower levels of problem loans and had much less loss content than  its peer banks. Fitch attributes the superior performance to solid underwriting,  relatively stronger local markets and sound credit risk management. However,  PBCT has experienced very strong commercial loan growth over multiple years,  which Fitch believes could lead to asset quality performance below the company's  very strong historical trends.  Earnings remain a drag on PBCT's ratings. PBCT's earnings rank near the bottom  of the mid-tier bank peer group. Weak earnings are primarily attributable to low  interest rates which have resulted in NIM compression felt by most of the  industry. Although PBCT's balance sheet is asset sensitive and should benefit in  a rising rate environment, Fitch expects earnings to perform below the peer  median over the medium term based on returns on average assets. However, in a  scenario where short-term rates rise significantly, Fitch expects that PBCT's  earnings will improve more dramatically to levels in line with the mid-tier peer  group. RATING SENSITIVITIES - IDRs, VRs AND SENIOR DEBT PBCT's ratings are primarily sensitive to asset quality. Should asset quality  metrics begin to deteriorate, particularly in the commercial loan category,  PBCT's ratings could be downgraded further. Conversely, positive ratings action  would be predicated upon a number of factors, namely seasoning of the loan  portfolio with minimal credit deterioration, material earnings improvement  commensurate with higher rated institutions and moderated loan growth.  RATING SENSITIVITIES - HOLDING COMPANY Should PBCTs holding company begin to exhibit signs of weakness, demonstrate  trouble accessing the capital markets, or have inadequate cash flow coverage to  meet near-term obligations, there is the potential that Fitch could notch the  holding company IDR and VR from the ratings of the operating companies. This is  viewed as unlikely though for PBCT given the strength of the holding company  liquidity profile.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR  PBCT has a Support Rating of '5' and Support Rating Floor of 'NF'. In Fitch's  view, PBCT is not systemically important and therefore, the probability of  support is unlikely. IDRs and VRs do not incorporate any support.  RATING SENSITVITIES - SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR  PBCT's Support Rating and Support Rating Floor are sensitive to Fitch's  assumption around capacity to procure extraordinary support in case of need.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES Subordinated debt and other hybrid capital issued by PBCT and by various issuing  vehicles are all notched down from PBCT or its bank subsidiaries' VRs in  accordance with Fitch's assessment of each instrument's respective  non-performance and relative loss severity risk profiles.  RATING SENSITIVITIES - SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES The ratings of subordinated debt and other hybrid capital issued by PBCT and its  subsidiaries are primarily sensitive to any change in PBCT's VR. To the extent that one of PBCT's subsidiary or affiliated companies is not  considered to be a core business, Fitch could also notch the subsidiary's rating  from PBCT's IDR. KEY RATING DRIVERS - LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS PBCT's uninsured deposit ratings are rated one notch higher than the company's  IDR and senior unsecured debt because U.S. uninsured deposits benefit from  depositor preference. U.S. depositor preference gives deposit liabilities  superior recovery prospects in the event of default.  KEY RATING SENSITIVITIES - LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS The ratings of long- and short-term deposits issued by PBCT and its subsidiaries  are primarily sensitive to any change in PBCT's long- and short-term IDRs.  Fitch has downgraded the following ratings and revised the Outlook to Stable  from Negative: People's United Financial, Inc. --Long-term IDR to 'BBB+' from 'A-';  --Viability rating to 'bbb+' from 'a-'; --Senior unsecured to 'BBB+' from 'A-'; --Short-term IDR to 'F2' from 'F1;. People's United Bank --Long-term IDR to 'BBB+' from at 'A-';  --Viability rating to 'bbb+' from 'a-'; --Subordinated debt to 'BBB' from 'BBB+' --Long-term deposits to 'A-' from 'A'; --Short-term IDR to 'F2' from 'F1'; --Short-term deposits to 'F2' from 'F1'. Chittenden Corporation --Subordinated debt to 'BBB' from 'BBB+'. Fitch has affirmed the following ratings People's United Financial, Inc. --Support at '5'; --Support floor at 'NF'.

10,"   By Jessica Toonkel and Supantha Mukherjee  Wall Street signaled skepticism on Monday that AT&T Inc would secure the government approvals needed to carry out its planned $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner Inc, with shares of both companies falling as analysts scrutinized the deal. Time Warner shares were trading some 20 percent below the implied value of AT&T's $107.50 per share cash and stock offer, indicating investors doubt that the companies would be able to complete the transaction.The deal, announced on Saturday, would give AT&T control of cable TV channels HBO and CNN, film studio Warner Bros and other coveted assets and reshape the media landscape.Dallas-based AT&T said on Saturday it would need approval of the U.S. Department of Justice and the companies were determining which Time Warner U.S. Federal Communications Commission licenses, if any, would need to transfer to AT&T. Any such transfers would require FCC approval. AT&T Chief Executive Randall Stephenson said on Monday he expects government clearances for the deal because it is a so-called vertical integration that will not eliminate a competitor, a situation that is viewed more favorably by antitrust enforcers. ""While regulators will often times have concerns with vertical integrations, those are always remedied by conditions imposed on the merger, so that's how we envision this one to play out,"" Stephenson told CNBC.Despite its big media footprint, Time Warner has only one FCC-regulated broadcast station, WPCH-TV in Atlanta. Time Warner could sell the license to try to avoid a formal FCC review, several analysts said.Any decision to review the deal would be made by regulatory officials at the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission, White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters on Monday.""The president would hope and expect that regulators would carefully consider the potential impact of this deal on consumers,"" Earnest added.Shares of AT&T closed down 1.7 percent at $36.86 and shares of Time Warner fell 3 percent to $86.78.  FOCUS ON APPROVALS Investors, Wall Street analysts and traders on Monday expressed concerns about the implications of the antitrust and regulatory challenges. “I don’t know how favorably regulators will look upon this,” said media investor Sanjay Sen, chief investment officer of BloombergSen Investment Partners of Toronto. The total value of broken deals is nearly $700 billion so far this year, a fact that has sidelined some investors. ""The regulatory environment has been unbelievable this year and I think everyone is on edge,"" said an arbitrage investor  considering buying exposure to the deal who did not want to be identified because they were not authorized to speak to the press. The biggest deals to fall apart in 2016 include Office Depot–Staples, Baker Hughes–Halliburton, Allergan–Pfizer and Norfolk Southern–Canadian Pacific Railways. Many of the deals drew objections from the Department of Justice and U.S. Treasury. ""We are unprepared at this point to assign anything higher than a 50/50 probability of deal approval,"" wrote MoffettNathanson Research in a report, downgrading Time Warner to 'neutral' but raising its target price by $8 to $100.The deal's arbitrage spread of more than 20 percent is wider than five other recent deals that regulators subsequently shot down or were withdrawn, including Comcast Corp's planned takeover of Time Warner Cable. That deal had a spread of only 5 percent. The deal, announced just over two weeks before the Nov. 8 U.S. election, was also generating skepticism among both Republicans and Democrats.OTHER QUESTIONS  Others were unnerved by the rationale for the deal and the massive $170 billion debt balance the combined company may hold after the deal closes.“The CEOs couldn’t easily explain the synergies and I can’t clearly understand them,” said Sen, who also expressed concern about AT&T embarking on a new deal so shortly after buying DirecTV last year for $48.5 billion. “How successfully will it integrate these three large and different businesses?” he asked.  Analysts at Cowen & Co said it was a ""struggle"" to understand why the acquisition made sense. ""If it is simply differentiated content AT&T is interested in we don’t understand why this couldn’t have been solved by some form of partnership,” the firm wrote in a note to downgrade the company's investment rating to 'market perform' from 'outperform.'Analysts at Moody's, which put AT&T on review for a downgrade after the acquisition was announced, said regulators could include conditions that limit the wireless provider's ability to use Time Warner content as a competitive advantage, ultimately undermining its objective to differentiate its mobile and pay TV platforms with exclusive content.John Traynor, chief investment officer of People’s United Wealth Management, which owns shares of both AT&T and Time Warner, said his firm would vote for the deal as it looked like a good marriage of content and distribution.""In the 1980s and 1990s it was all about hardware. For the last 10 years it’s been all about connectivity and content,” Traynor said. He expects the deal to face lengthy scrutiny by regulators but eventually to be completed. ""We’ll be talking about this a year from now, but Comcast-NBC got through,” he said, referring to the $30 billion purchase of NBCUniversal by cable company Comcast.""We think AT&T can handle the debt load,” he added.
