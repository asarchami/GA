4,"   By Dhanya Skariachan | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Best Buy Co (BBY.N) shares tumbled about 30 percent on Thursday after the world's largest consumer electronics chain reported disappointing holiday sales and warned of a bigger-than-expected decline in quarterly operating margins.The company blamed intense discounting by rivals, tight supplies of phones and high-end tablets industrywide, and weak traffic in December.The news, which knocked off almost $4 billion of Best Buy's market value, was the latest evidence that holiday sales at many chains came at the expense of profit.""It just seems that the promotions did not drive incremental sales, that opening on Thanksgiving just added costs,"" Janney Capital Markets analyst David Strasser said.Adding to the pressure on Best Buy, he said, was the ""promotional cadence of troubled retailers"" like Sears (SHLD.O), Toys R Us Inc and smaller electronics chains.Best Buy cut prices sharply in November and December to thwart competition from Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and other chains. The electronics specialist said on Thursday that it continued to discount in January.Best Buy's stock, one of 2013's hottest, was down 27.6 percent at $27.19 after touching a low of $25.99 earlier in the session. Heading into Thursday, only one out of two dozen analysts covering the stock had a ""sell"" rating on it.Shares of consumer electronics peers such as RadioShack Corp RSH.N and Hhgregg Inc (HGG.N) also fell. The overall weakness in the consumer electronics industry was a ""shock for everyone,"" Best Buy Chief Executive Officer Hubert Joly said, but insisted that the company's own turnaround was not at risk.""Since the beginning, we've seen this transformation as a multiyear journey, and we are in the early innings of this ball game,"" he said.Joly, who joined the company in the fall of 2012, has removed layers of management, eliminated hundreds of jobs, closed unprofitable stores and boosted cash by selling Best Buy's stake in a European joint venture with Carphone Warehouse Group Plc CPW.L.So far, he has taken out $550 million in annualized costs, and he said he saw room to make the company more efficient by reducing and better managing the items that are returned by customers. Best Buy also plans to do more to personalize its email marketing efforts, especially since it has a database of 40 million members.In what many on Wall Street called the most promotional holiday season since the recession, shoppers were bombarded by too many emails from retailers, making it harder for Best Buy to stand out, Joly said.Best Buy had warned in late November that its decision to discount more could hurt margins. But some analysts had then expected the chain to offset some of the margin pressure through cost cuts and market share gains.MARGINS VS. MARKET SHARE  Heavy discounting ate into profits, and Best Buy expects operating margin, excluding special items, to be 175 to 185 basis points lower in the fourth quarter ending February 1 than a year earlier. Credit Suisse analyst Gary Balter said that outlook was well below Wall Street expectations.The discounting, however, boosted Best Buy's market share at a time when overall industry sales fell, Joly said, citing data from NPD Group.Best Buy's sales at stores open at least 14 months were down 0.9 percent in the United States and up 0.1 percent internationally in the nine weeks ended January 4. Total revenue fell about 2.6 percent to $11.45 billion.Declines in sales of digital imaging, movies, MP3 players and other products more than offset strong demand for computers, appliances and gaming devices, the company said.Best Buy's online segment was a bright spot in the otherwise weak report.

Penney, Best Buy shares rally after results* Dow up 0.5 pct; S&P 500 up 0.5 pct; Nasdaq up 0.7 pctBy Caroline ValetkevitchNEW YORK, Feb 27 U.S. stocks rose on Thursday after comments from Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen offered some relief to investors worried about the central bank's tapering of economic stimulus. Tech shares, including Apple Inc, helped lead the advance, which pushed the S&P 500 above the 2013 year-end closing level and within points of surpassing Monday's intraday record high. The gains lifted the benchmark index into positive territory for the year.Addressing the Senate Banking Committee, Yellen said the Fed would be on alert to make sure that recent signs of economic weakness are due to cold weather and storms, rather than a more fundamental slowdown.""Yellen came in and did exactly what she was supposed to do, and said, 'Listen, the weather is still a variable.' But she made it clear the Fed is ready to stand up and do what's necessary to continue to support the economy, and that's exactly what Wall Street wanted to hear,"" said Adam Sarhan, chief executive officer of Sarhan Capital in New York. The theory that some recent lackluster data was due to the weather rather than worsening fundamentals had helped investors shrug off the recent weak economic numbers.Retailers ranked among the top gainers for a third session, with the shares of both J.C. Penney Co Inc and Best Buy Co Inc jumping after the companies posted strong results. Late Wednesday, J.C. Penney forecast more improvement in its comparable sales and gross profit margin this fiscal year. On Thursday, Best Buy reported adjusted earnings that topped forecasts.

11,"   By Caroline Valetkevitch | NEW YORK  NEW YORK The S&P 500 closed at a record on Thursday and ended in positive territory for the year after Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said harsh weather seems to be to behind recent U.S. economic softness.That gave some relief to investors who supported the view that heavy snowstorms and unusually cold weather - and not worsening fundamentals - were to blame for weak U.S. employment, retail sales and other data.The advance lifted the S&P 500 above its 2013 year-end closing level of 1,848.36, which has served as resistance in recent sessions.""The market was worried. She could have excluded weather and perhaps talked more about the soft patch,"" said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial, which is based in Newark, New Jersey.""I think she gave the market some comfort that she thought it was probably mostly due to weather-related issues.""Testifying before the Senate Banking Committee, Yellen also said the Fed would watch carefully to make sure weather was indeed behind the recent weakness. But she said it would take a ""significant change"" to the economy's prospects for the central bank to put plans to reduce its bond-buying program on hold.Some retailers scored sharp gains for a third session, with the shares of J.C. Penney Co Inc (JCP.N) and others jumping after the companies posted strong results. Mylan Inc (MYL.O) gave one of the biggest boosts to both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq.

The 10-year note was yielding 2.649 percent. The Japanese yen and Swiss franc, both traditional safe-haven plays in foreign exchange, gained.""There are definitely fears about geopolitics; the general mood towards emerging markets is not great. The concern is this could develop into a proper civil war in Ukraine that splits the country,"" Manik Narain, strategist at UBS in London, said. Wall Street was little changed, as comments from Yellen failed to provide much clarity on the impact of the weather on recent economic weakness. Data on Thursday showed orders for long-lasting U.S. manufactured goods excluding transportation unexpectedly rose last month, as did a gauge of business spending plans.""Durables came in better than feared, but it is difficult to tell what the weather impact was and what the impact of an actual slowdown might be,"" said Joseph Tanious, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management in New York.Yellen, during her testimony before the Senate, said recent data pointed to a softening in spending in the U.S. economy that might be explained partly by the bad weather.If the view holds that harsh winter weather is to blame, investors are likely to expect the Fed to keep trimming its bond-buying program by $10 billion at each policy meeting, leaving it on track to end the bond purchases completely by the end of the year. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.22 point, or 0 percent, to 16,198.63, the S&P 500 gained 0.49 point, or 0.03 percent, to 1,845.65 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 4.856 points, or 0.11 percent, to 4,296.92.Shares of both J.C. Penney Co Inc and Best Buy Co Inc jumped after the companies posted strong results. Penney forecast more improvement in its comparable sales and gross profit margin this fiscal year, and Best Buy posted adjusted earnings that topped forecasts.Penney surged 21 percent to $7.23 while Best Buy advanced 5.4 percent to $27.22. The S&P retail index <.SPXRT dipped 0.1 percent following a five-day rallyThe MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 45 nations, slipped 0.20 point, or 0.05 percent, to 407.16. The sharpening rhetoric in Ukraine held down Europe's main markets, which lost 0.4 percent. In Germany the DAX  fell 1 percent for the biggest drop since Feb. 3, while the euro dropped to a two-week low of $1.3641.There was plenty of additional pressure for the euro. Spain's fourth-quarter gross domestic product figures were revised downward, and ECB data showed little improvement in the amount of credit reaching euro-zone firms.German inflation figures suggested there would be scant pick-up in euro-zone inflation, which is to be published on Friday.The ECB meets next week and is under pressure to cut interest rates again and dip back into its unconventional policy cupboard to ensure the euro zone doesn't become mired in deflation.In bond markets, the possibility that more moves are coming from the ECB and a strong debt auction in Italy helped lower-rated Italian and Spanish debt keep pace with safe-haven German Bunds.Among commodities, copper dropped to a three-month low below $7,000 a tonne, extending its losses over the past week on recent concerns about slower growth in China.Gold prices edged up due to a steady dollar, but remained well below the previous day's four-month high as buyers of coins, bars and jewelry in Asian markets held off in expectation of a further price drop. Spot gold advanced 0.2 percent $1,333.50 an ounce, off Wednesday's high of $1,345.35.After recent falls, the yuan saw a second day of relative calm, standing at 6.1279 per dollar, just off Wednesday's low of 6.1351.

Penny, Best Buy rally after results* Indexes: Dow and S&P 500 flat, Nasdaq up 0.2 pctBy Ryan VlastelicaNEW YORK, Feb 27 U.S. stocks were little changed on Thursday as comments from Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen failed to provide clarity on the impact of a harsh winter on recent economic weakness, while concerns rose over turmoil in Ukraine. Addressing the Senate Banking Committee, Yellen said some economic data had been weaker since she spoke to the House of Representatives on Feb. 11, but that it was difficult to say how much of that was due to weather. Yellen also confirmed that the central bank would keep to its stimulus-trimming schedule.The theory that some recent lackluster data was due to the weather rather than worsening fundamentals had helped investors shrug off the data and recently took the S&P 500 to a record high. However, the benchmark index has struggled to break decisively above its 2013 year-end closing level of 1,848.36, and trading could take a more pronounced turn to the downside on indications the economy is slowing.In the latest economic report, orders for durable goods fell 1 percent in January, a drop that was less than forecast. However, jobless claims unexpectedly rose in the latest week. ""Durables came in better than feared, but it is difficult to tell what the weather impact was, and what the impact of an actual slowdown might be,"" said Joseph Tanious, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management in New York. ""I think we're in a cyclical slowdown now, and the weather isn't helping, although it should create pent-up demand.""Geopolitical tensions mounted after armed men seized the regional government headquarters and parliament in Ukraine's Crimea and raised the Russian flag. Ukraine's parliament appointed former economy minister Arseny Yatseniuk as prime minister, while ousted leader Viktor Yanukovich said he was still president in a statement sent to Russian news agencies from an unknown location.The Ukraine uncertainty spurred investors to head for the safety of U.S. Treasuries, where yields fell to two-week lows. ""As an investor, you need to weigh the possibility of something going wrong against the probability of something going right,"" said Tanious. ""It is a headwind to sentiment, but unless it has a big impact on oil, which I don't expect, we should work through it.The Dow Jones industrial average was up 6.52 points, or 0.04 percent, at 16,204.93.

30,"  SAN FRANCISCO/FRANKFURT European Union antitrust regulators are preparing to step up investigations of Google Inc's practices on several fronts and are likely to revise certain terms of a settlement involving its search engine that was proposed earlier this year, the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday.Google has been the target of a European Commission investigation since November 2010, when more than a dozen complainants, including Microsoft Corp, accused the company of promoting its own services at their expense.In February, Google agreed to make concessions on how it displays competitors' links, striking a deal that ended a three-year antitrust probe and avoided a hefty fine. But the agreement has been criticized, both by tech companies and European politicians, as inadequate. Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said at the time he would accept Google's concessions without consulting complainants, prompting a furious response.On Tuesday, the Commission said it was considering formal complaints to the agreement and aimed to make a decision on the matter in September. ""We have written to the formal complainants in the ongoing proceedings and we have not received yet all their replies,"" a spokesman for the Commission said. ""In early August all replies will have been submitted. We will then thoroughly analyze the arguments they contain and, depending on the outcome of that analysis, the next steps will be decided by Mr. Almunia in September.""Google may face other investigations, including regarding its Android operating system for smartphones.The European Commission recently sent a fresh request for information to handset makers on their dealings with Android, which runs on roughly four-fifths of the world's smartphones. That line of inquiry is likely to turn into a formal investigation, the Journal reporting, citing a person with knowledge of the situation. Last month, Almunia said he could initiate an investigation of YouTube if he saw any attempt by Google to abuse its dominance of online video searching. In a guest editorial for German newspaper Bild on Tuesday, Martin Shulz, head of the EU Parliament, argued that the decision on how to treat Google should not be taken by an outgoing Commission. Almunia will vacate his post later this year.  ""The EU has to make the decision on how to deal with Google with care,"" he said in the editorial.

34,"  (Adds comments from representatives of Charney and Wilson in paragraphs 10, 18 and 19)By Nadia DamouniNEW YORK Aug 15 From American Apparel Inc  to Lululemon Athletica Inc, Men's Wearhouse Inc  and Best Buy Co Inc, a series of boardroom battles across North America underscore how difficult it can be for companies to part ways with their founders.In each of these cases, the boards decided it was time for the founders to step down from their roles either as chief executive or chairman, but faced stiff resistance from the founders, some of whom used their substantial equity stakes to fight back.Corporate governance experts expect more such corporate dramas as shareholders are increasingly holding boards accountable for succession planning, investment returns and overall fiduciary duties. As a result, boards are asserting their authority more frequently, which can put them on collision courses with CEOs, including founders.""Today's boards are increasingly feeling pressure to anticipate the CEO leadership needed to drive future success. This is especially true when the CEO is the founder of the company,"" said Jane Stevenson, head of the global CEO succession practice at Korn Ferry International.""In these situations the board can feel significant conflict between appropriate homage to the past and the leadership needed to drive success in the future.""As many as 42 Fortune 500 companies have founders in CEO positions, according to data compiled by recruitment firm Heidrick & Struggles for Reuters. These founder-CEOs have an average tenure of 22.5 years, compared with around six years for non-founder CEOs.""Founders are often the ones that have the 'special sauce' that makes a company's offering and culture work, so they might be given additional latitude ... as their vision drove value creation in the first place,"" said Heidrick & Struggles' Vice Chairman John Wood.American Apparel, under Charney's leadership, was known for its racy advertising and ""Made in the USA"" sweatshop-free model. However, the company has posted losses in almost every quarter in the last four years and came under fire in 2010 for lax financial controls.In June, the board fired Charney for allegedly misusing corporate funds and helping to spread nude photos of a former employee on the Internet, a source previously told Reuters. The photos were allegedly posted on a blog by another American Apparel employee who was impersonating the former employee.A spokesman for Charney, Keith Estabrook, said, ""He was terminated for allegedly failing to prevent the use of impersonating materials, and he did not actively participate."" Charney has denied the allegations and is fighting to regain control of the company. He increased his stake in the apparel retailer to 44 percent, from about 27 percent, but signed over his voting rights and shares to the hedge fund Standard General as collateral for a loan.Charney intends to have a say over key decisions, such as the makeup of the board or M&A deals, whether or not he returns as CEO, a source close to the matter said this week.American Apparel is waiting for the results of an internal investigation before deciding what to do about its founder. A spokesman for American Apparel declined to comment.FOUNDERS' SHADOW In the case of Lululemon, the Canadian yoga apparel chain was once one of the hottest stocks in retail but it suffered a damaging recall last year involving see-through yoga pants. Late last year, Chip Wilson, the company's founder, stepped down as non-executive chairman to pave the way for new CEO Laurent Potdevin to run the company.Wilson, however, remained on the board so that directors could tap his knowledge about the company and its customers. The board assured Potdevin that he would be able to run Lululemon without undue influence from Wilson, according to a source familiar with the situation who spoke on condition of anonymity. But tensions began to build as some directors felt Wilson wanted to be excessively involved in management decisions; at the same time, Wilson, who has a 27 percent stake in Lululemon,  became increasingly frustrated that he was not being fully heard, the source said.The problems spilled out into the open in June, when Wilson lashed out at the board, saying its new chairman and another director were too focused on short-term growth.A spokesman for Wilson said he had stepped down from management in January 2012 to give then CEO Christine Day the room she wanted to run the company. Lululemon's board then asked Wilson to return from Australia to address a product quality issue, said the spokesman, Jim Courtovich.""Chip Wilson has always been focused on doing what is in the best interests of Lululemon and its shareholders,"" Courtovich said. ""Since then, he has been providing important input that has changed the direction of the company.""A representative for Lululemon declined to comment.The two sides settled last week, when Wilson agreed not to wage a proxy contest and to sell half his stake to private equity firm Advent International. Still, shares of Lululemon have fallen more than 40 percent since Potdevin's appointment in December, underscoring the toll such corporate clashes can take on share valuations.Similar battles between the boards and founders of Men's Wearhouse, Best Buy and Groupon Inc have rattled their investors until the disagreements were finally settled.""Numerous times I've seen first-hand how the founder dynamic can be particularly challenging for fellow board members to successfully grapple with. Internal disputes that become public are one of the most dysfunctional events companies face,"" said Brad Allen, the founder of Branav Shareholder Advisory Services, which counsels boards and shareholders on governance issues.FOUNDERS AS AN ASSET To be sure, not all founder departures are acrimonious. Directors and recruiters say many founders have a deep well of knowledge about their companies and customers, and they can be invaluable to their successors.Former Nielsen Holdings N.V. CEO David Calhoun said he used to seek advice from Arthur Nielsen Jr on how to resist pressure from media clients for favorable research. Nielsen Jr is credited with transforming the company, which his father founded in 1923, into a name synonymous with television ratings.""Art Jr's advice went to the heart of our business: the potential conflict between serving client's needs (the companies we measure) and our commitment to objective measurement,"" said Calhoun, who is now executive chairman at Nielsen.Bill Ford had fully supported Alan Mulally when he took over as CEO of Ford Motor Co in September 2006, said Marshall Goldsmith, an executive coach who has worked with Mulally.Early in his tenure, when some top executives challenged Mulally's initiative to conduct a weekly review of business priorities, he had the backing of Ford, who helped Mulally implement the plan. The weekly review turned out to be central to the No.2 U.S. automaker's successful turnaround, according to Goldsmith.Goldsmith said his advice to founders is to pick a date to hand off the company and start working on a succession plan.""Leave with dignity, don't get thrown out,"" Goldsmith said.

The S&P energy index rose 0.5 percent and ranked as the best performer of the 10 major S&P sectors. The S&P 500 hit an intraday high of 2,005.04, climbing above the 2,000 mark for the second straight day. On Monday, though, the benchmark could not hold on to that mark and ended at 1,997.92.

""Even though that (durables) number is lopsided and kind of skews the picture, when you have more aircraft orders and auto sales, in the long run, those are positives. That shows the economy is recovering and there are some good prospects,"" Kravetz said.The market's trend higher is still seen as intact. The S&P 500's price-to-earnings ratio is within historical norms, leading many analysts to believe stocks are not overvalued. Nonetheless, further pronounced gains may be a challenge because of potential headwinds such as a reduction in Federal Reserve stimulus and a simmering conflict between Ukraine and Russia.The Dow Jones industrial average rose 29.83 points or 0.17 percent, to end at 17,106.70.

38,"   By Sruthi Ramakrishnan  Best Buy Co Inc, the largest U.S. consumer electronics retailer, said same-store sales were expected to fall and higher discounting would erode margins in the second half of the year. Best Buy's shares fell as much as 7 percent on Tuesday after the company also reported lower-than-expected revenue for the third straight quarter, hurt by weak sales of consumer electronics and competition from online retailers.The company said it expected same-store sales to decline in low single-digit percentage terms and operating margins to remain under pressure due to higher sales of lower-margin items online and discounting in Canada and China.Same-store sales fell 2.7 percent in the second quarter ended Aug. 2, steeper than the 2.2 percent decline estimated by analysts polled by research firm Consensus Metrix. U.S. same-store sales slipped 2 percent.Operating margin fell to 2.7 percent from 4.5 percent. Best Buy's gross margins have not grown in the past 14 quarters, partly due to competition from online retailers such as Amazon.com.Amazon's quarterly sales of electronics and general merchandise jumped nearly 30 percent in North America.Best Buy's margins were hit further last year after it launched a plan to match the lowest prices offered by local and online retailers. Competition from online retailers is likely to intensify. In a recent Nielsen survey of people likely to buy items such as TVs and cameras in the next six months, 42 percent said they would buy it online, up from 15 percent a year earlier. Analysts said Best Buy's forecast was conservative and the company could benefit from the expected iPhone launch next month and sales of ultra high-definition 4K televisions.The customer response to 4K televisions was encouraging, but their impact on sales would be ""relatively limited"" this year, Chief Executive Hubert Joly said on a conference call. Best Buy said it planned to invest $40 million-$50 million in the second half to improve shipping and order fulfillment.Industrywide sales of consumer electronics such as TVs and desktop and notebook computers fell 2.5 percent in the quarter, the company said, citing NPD Group's Weekly Tracking Service. Such items make up about 65 percent of Best Buy's U.S. revenue. WEAK REVENUE Best Buy's revenue fell 4 percent to $8.89 billion in the second quarter.

The day's gains were broad, with only the telecom  and utility sectors lower on the day. Both groups are viewed as defensive plays that underperform in periods of economic expansion.

80,"   By Nandita Bose and Ramkumar Iyer  Best Buy Co Inc (BBY.N), the largest U.S. consumer electronics chain, reported better-than-expected quarterly profit and sales, helped by strong demand for smartphones and large-screen TVs, sending its shares up over 8 percent.Best Buy, whose profits have benefited from cost-cutting lately, will continue to focus on aggressively pursuing its cost cutting initiatives this year. In March, the company said it planned this year to start a cost-cutting effort to save $400 million over the next three years.""These savings are not expected to begin until the back half of fiscal 2016,"" Chief Executive Hubert Joly said on an earnings conference call.Since 2012, Best Buy has cut jobs, removed layers of management and closed stores. Best Buy said its revenue growth in the United States was driven by sales of mobile phones bundled with billing plans by telecom carriers. Under these plans, telecom carriers allow customers to buy new phones for a low down payment and pay the remaining amount in installments along with monthly bills. Revenue from the U.S. rose 1.4 percent to $7.9 billion in the first quarter. However, same-store sales fell 0.7 percent. For the second  quarter, the company said it expected ""a flat to positive low-single digit revenue growth rate"" in its U.S. business and ""a flat to negative low-single digit revenue growth rate"" in its overall business. The total revenue growth forecast includes the impact of some store closures and consolidation of operations in Canada, the company's second largest market. International revenue declined 22.1 percent to $668 million, due to an impact from foreign currency fluctuations and the loss of revenue from its Canadian operations. The company's comparable online sales sharply decelerated and grew 5.3 percent this quarter from 29.2 percent in the same period last year due to pressure from rollout of initiatives like ship from store, softness in demand for large online categories like tablets and computers among others.The net income attributable to Best Buy's shareholders fell to $129 million, or 36 cents per share, in the first quarter ended May 2 from $461 million, or $1.31 per share, a year earlier.Excluding items, the company earned 37 cents per share versus 35 cents in the same period a year ago. Revenue fell 1 percent to $8.56 billion.

That gives weight to the opinion of most central bank officials who agreed that economic growth would climb to a healthier pace and the labor market would strengthen, according to minutes from the Fed's April 28-29 meeting.Fed officials believed it would be premature to raise rates in June, even though most felt the U.S. economy was set to rebound from a dismal start to the year.Data measuring the growth in the U.S. manufacturing sector in May is due at 9:45 a.m. ET (1345 GMT) and 15 minutes later the National Association of Realtors data is expected to show that sales of used homes increased last month.""There is a malaise in the market as investors re-adjust their expectations of a Fed hike,"" said Andrew Barber, chief market strategist at Eagleview Capital in Delaware.

The S&P 500 hit a record intraday high on Wednesday. The Dow, which had closed at record highs in the previous two sessions, was also briefly on track for another all-time high close.Salesforce.com shares rose 3.7 percent to $72.77 in premarket trading after the cloud software company, the subject of takeover speculation for the past few weeks, reported a profit for the first time in seven quarters.

84,"   By Ritsuko Ando and Reiji Murai | TOKYO, June 19  TOKYO, June 19 Japan's once-mighty electronics makers have lost billions of dollars from TVs but Sony Corp  and Panasonic Corp won't quit, saying retreating from the world's living rooms would close the door to more promising businesses.Consumer electronics account for a shrinking portion of income after restructuring focused Sony on gaming and image sensors and Panasonic on electric car batteries. But TVs remain among their best-known products.Staying in the TV market - particularly at the premium end - keeps the pair relevant and ensures their brands and quality are at the forefront when consumers shop for other electronics, they said. Sony, for example, said it saw a strong correlation between sales trends for its TVs and audio systems.That makes it worth persevering in a TV market dominated by Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and cheaper Asian rivals, with Sony and Panasonic content to hold modest shares by focusing on high-margin, high-definition ""4K"" models.""TVs are the soul of Sony and we don't want to be without them,"" Ichiro Takagi, head of Sony's home entertainment and sound business, told Reuters in an interview.Investors have long speculated about Sony and Panasonic gradually exiting TVs, reflecting Japan's declining position in the tech sector. But analysts also said sticking it out was worthwhile as long as they were profitable.""Especially for Sony... If they quit TVs, there's a chance that the Sony brand will be diminished,"" said Junya Ayada at Daiwa Securities.Sony holds 7 percent of an industry it once revolutionised with its Trinitron technology, while Panasonic has 4 percent. South Korean leaders Samsung and LG Electronics Inc  together hold about 40 percent.""There was a time when we were going after volume, and we totally lost that race,"" said Takagi. ""Even in the days of the Trinitron, we only had a share of around 10 percent. I think 10 percent is appropriate now."" RESTRUCTURING Under Chief Executive Kazuo Hirai, Sony has shed thousands of jobs and sold off its personal computer (PC) unit after several years of losses. Hirai has not ruled out dispensing with the TV arm as well if it fails to stay profitable.But Takagi said an exit was now less than likely after cost cutting helped the unit book a small operating profit in the last business year, its first in over a decade.Moreover, Sony - with interests ranging from its Hollywood studio to PlayStation videogames - aims to recapture its cachet as an entertainment-to-electronics group through increased collaboration across the company, Takagi said.TVs encapsulated the sound and picture technology developed by the various businesses, he said. Sony is also aiming for a high-end comeback in audio, earlier this year introducing a portable music player that costs over $1000. ""Historically, TVs have been at the centre,"" Takagi said. ""When sales rose, sales in audio and home theatre rose as well. As the TV operations recover... we'll see a rise in audio sales.""Pointing to a revival are Sony's 4K televisions. Last year, Sony quadrupled its share of TV sales at Best Buy Co Inc , the largest U.S. consumer electronics chain, to 12 percent by concentrating on large, high-end models, Takagi said.Analyst Hisakazu Torii at DisplaySearch said Japanese TV manufacturers had little choice but to focus on high-end models, particularly when faced with a rival like Samsung whose smartphone success has given it overwhelming resources.But 4K TVs already account for nearly 40 percent of sets with screens larger than 50 inches, meaning they were starting to lose exclusivity, he said.Analysts say consumers, particularly in the United States, are increasingly opting for larger sets for their living rooms to watch movies and live events, while opting for PCs and smartphones instead of small bedroom TVs. ""Once 4K penetration goes beyond 70 percent, that means commoditisation and price competition,"" Torii said.SMARTPHONES Panasonic, on the other hand, has not seen a comparable upturn, and is increasingly out-sold by previously little-known Chinese manufacturers such as TCL Corp.Its TV division reported seven consecutive years of loss while the overall company turned itself around by focusing on automotive technologies and high-margin home appliances.But Masahiro Shinada, head of Panasonic's TV business, said maintaining a presence in television made it easier to sell more profitable white goods - not only by lifting the company's image, but also winning cooperation from retailers who prefer to deal with manufacturers of high-volume products such as TVs.""They really open the way to selling refrigerators and washing machines,"" he said.Panasonic, like Sony, is looking to the high-end TV market for prestige and profitability. But as consumers increasingly watch content on the go, there is a risk of TVs losing their status as brand-defining devices.""Your kids' cellphones are Samsung, those kids become young adults, those young adults become adults,"" said Mark Sasicki, TV buyer at Abt Electronics - the largest single-store retailer in the United States, spread over 37 acres of a Chicago suburb. ""It plays into their appliance business.""

It is now in the third phase of a turnaround plan engineered by Chief Executive Officer Hubert Joly, who took over in August 2012.""The first phase was 'Don't die,'"" Joly told Reuters in a recent interview. ""Phase two was improve what we have, and we have clearly done that.

While Black Friday is not always a strong forecaster of holiday spending, last year reports of poor Black Friday spending were followed by deeper discounting and a rush of buying in the week before Christmas.

102,"  (Adds new comments, details on Walmart protest, comment from company official, online sales data, updates shares with closing prices)By Nandita Bose and Nathan LayneCHICAGO/PITTSBURGH Nov 27 America's annual Black Friday shopping extravaganza was short on fireworks this year as U.S. retailers' discounts on electronics, clothing and other holiday gifts failed to draw big crowds to stores and shopping malls.Major retail stocks including Best Buy and Wal-Mart closed lower while Target, picked out by one analyst for its promotion strategy, saw its shares tick up.Bargain hunters found relatively little competition compared with previous years. Some had already shopped Thursday evening, reflecting a new normal of U.S. holiday shopping, where stores open up with deals on Thanksgiving itself, rather than waiting until Black Friday.Retailers ""have taken the sense of urgency out for consumers by spreading their promotions throughout the year and what we are seeing is a result of that,"" said Jeff Simpson, director of the retail practice at Deloitte. Traffic in stores was light on Friday, while Thursday missed his expectations, he said.As much as 20 percent of holiday shopping is expected to be done over the Thanksgiving weekend this year, analysts said. But  the four days are not considered a strong indicator for the entire season. A slow start last year led to deeper promotions and a shopping rush in the final ten days of December.Steve Bratspies, chief merchandising officer, Wal-Mart Stores Inc, told Reuters he was not surprised that a store would see thinner crowds on Friday after it kicked off Black Friday deals on Thursday night.Suntrust Robinson Humphrey analysts were more blunt, calling Thursday a ""bust"". ""Members of our team who went to the malls first had no problem finding parking or navigating stores,"" he wrote in a note. The Macy's store at Water Tower Place mall on a rainy Chicago morning saw thin crowds in the early hours of Friday. Later in the morning, more than 1,000 protestors clogged Chicago's Magnificent Mile shopping corridor.Nia Darrell, a 23-year-old student, was shopping for coats and handbags at the store with two friends.""I shopped online yesterday and picked up most of what I wanted,"" she said."" I'm out because Black Friday is more like a tradition, but the discounts are similar even online this year.""While Black Friday may be losing some appeal in the United States, British shoppers have taken to the concept enthusiastically, with reports of large crowds at big stores and malls in the UK. Shares of Target Corp gained 0.4 percent, but J.C. Penney wad down 0.7 percent, and Macy's and Best Buy lost about 1 percent. Wal-Mart dipped 0.6 percent, while Amazon.com Inc was down 0.3 percent.A broad retail index was down 0.15 percent in abbreviated trading.Traffic was better at some retailers. Analysts at Cowen & Co said Target stood out with its ""innovative promotions,"" and teen retailer American Eagle Outfitters Inc saw more traffic due to store-wide discounts of 40 percent. ONLINE SALES RISE Shoppers in the United States spent $822 million online between midnight and 11 am ET, a 15-percent increase from 2014 but lower than the expected growth of 19 percent, according to the Adobe Digital Index, which tracked 180 million visits to over 4,500 U.S. retail sites. On Thanksgiving Day, online sales rose 22 percent from midnight to 5 pm ET.Many stores around the country were full on Thanksgiving evening. Media showed brawling shoppers at a packed Kentucky mall Thursday, forcing a police officer to break up the fight.Wal-Mart worker group 'Our Wal-Mart' said 1,400 workers planned to fast and protest around the country for better wages, but there was no indication that would hurt sales.Early Black Friday discounts included $700 off a 60-inch Samsung television at Best Buy for $799.99, 20 percent off a $75 purchase at Target, and a Kindle for $49.99 on Amazon.com.The National Retail Federation is expecting holiday sales to rise 3.7 percent, slower than last year's 4.1 percent growth rate, due to stagnant wages and sluggish job growth.Jorgette Clark, 27, said her budget would probably be lower this year because her husband works in the energy industry.""I feel like we scaled back this year.

U.S. District Judge Edward Chen on Wednesday dismissed the fraud claims from Benjamin Perez's $5 million lawsuit against Brisbane, California-based Monster but allowed him to proceed on a subset of his breach of warranty counts under California law and the federal Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act.

110,"   By Siddharth Cavale  Feb 25 Discouraging results from three key U.S. retailers on Thursday underscored shoppers' reluctance to buy discretionary goods such as electronics and apparel, an indicator that consumer spending would remain muted this year.Electronics retailer Best Buy Co Inc, department store operator Kohl's Corp and Sears Holdings Corp  all reported weaker-than-expected sales at stores open at least a year.A decline in stock markets, led by a slowdown in China, has prompted consumers to be more prudent with their discretionary incomes. Even with gas prices at multi-year lows, falling real median incomes have further tightened purse strings.""Both Wall Street and Main Street households have begun to watch their spending, as we've seen both in our store checks and in higher personal savings rates, which have been rising ever since last May,"" retail research group Customer Growth Partners' Craig Johnson said.Instead, consumers are saving more or spending on big-ticket items such as homes, home renovations and cars. An unusually warm winter has also played a key role in shaping shopping trends these past two quarters.While home-improvement chains such as Home Depot and Lowe's Inc benefited from the mild weather as outdoor and home remodeling activities rose, retailers Macy's Inc, Sears and Kohl's struggled to sell coats, gloves and woolens.Shares of Best Buy, Kohl's and Sears were volatile on Thursday morning, all dropping a few percentage points before recovering, mirroring choppy trading in the broader market. But analysts said they expected the uncertainty to continue through the year.U.S. retail sales, excluding autos, gas and restaurants, will increase by 2.4 percent in 2016, compared with a 3.6 percent growth last year, retail research firm Customer Growth Partners said in a report. This reflects ""flatlining"" incomes for all but the top 20 percent of households, the diminishing effects of lower gas prices, and the decline of the ""wealth effect"" due to the recent $2 trillion decline in stock market values, the report said.Kohl's on Thursday reported a 0.8 percent rise in established-store sales, below analysts' expectations, and said it planned to close 18 underperforming stores this year.Kohl's CEO Kevin Mansell said because of a difficult macroeconomic and retail environment, the company was unlikely to meet its 2017 sales goal of $21 billion.Comparable-store sales at the once-iconic Sears stores fell 6.9 percent, in line with estimates. Those at Best Buy fell slightly more than analysts had expected as demand for mobile devices and computer electronics continued to falter, according to research firm Consensus Metrix.These lackluster performances follow disappointing results from Macy's, which on Tuesday reported a 4.3 percent decline in same-store sales.

He said the deal was a stock transaction, rather than a cash payment, but declined to provide further details. Both companies dispatch in-home tech support within hours of a request to fix a wonky printer, install a new TV or troubleshoot WiFi problems, among other services.HelloTech hit a few bumps last year after launching, with some negative customer feedback that its workforce of predominantly college students was unprofessional.Wolpert said the company has worked out the glitches. HelloTech has a five-star rating on customer review site Yelp.

114,"   By Nandita Bose and Abhijith Ganapavaram  Best Buy Co Inc's (BBY.N) earnings beat expectations on Tuesday and the company registered strong online sales growth, but a lower-than-expected outlook for current-quarter profit sent its shares down more than 7 percent in early trade.The electronics retailer said second-quarter profit will be impacted partly due to a supply disruption for some high-margin products after an earthquake in Japan and due to investments in services launched last September. The earthquake also hit production at companies like Sony Corp (6758.T)Chief Executive Hubert Joly said he expects the supply disruption from Japan to be limited and a rebound in demand when supply resumes.

119,"   By Alastair Sharp | TORONTO  TORONTO BlackBerry Ltd unveiled a second Android-based handset on Tuesday, a device combining Alphabet Inc's popular software and broad app catalog with the Canadian company's security and productivity features at a lower price. The faded smartphone pioneer is hoping the DTEK50 will sell in greater numbers than the Priv, its first phone using the Android operating system, which Chief Executive John Chen has said suffered because of its high price. The company said the 5.2-inch touchscreen-only DTEK50 is available from Tuesday for pre-order from BlackBerry's online shop in the U.S., Canada, UK, France, Germany, Spain, Italy and The Netherlands for $299. It plans to begin shipping the device on Aug. 8.""This is a good marriage of proposition and price point for enterprises,"" said John Jackson, an analyst at International Data Corp. Shares in the Waterloo, Ontario-based company were up 1.4 percent at $7.18 on the Nasdaq and rose 1.6 percent to C$9.50 in Toronto. At its November launch the Priv, which features a slide out keyboard, cost $699 without a contract in the United States and C$899 without a contract in Canada. The company trimmed the Priv's price in April.Calling the DTEK50 ""the world's most secure Android smartphone,"" BlackBerry said it will alert users if someone is making remote use of its camera or microphone, or accessing the phone's location information.  BlackBerry did not announce any distribution deals with major U.S. carriers, with initial U.S. sales instead expected to come mostly via Best Buy Co Inc, Amazon.com Inc and BlackBerry's own online store. Canada's biggest wireless carriers will all sell the device.""The lack of specific detail on operator channels outside Canada says that there's still no path to massive volumes,"" IDC's Jackson added.BlackBerry recognized sales of roughly 500,000 devices in the three months to the end of May, down from some 1.1 million a year earlier as demand for its aging product portfolio sunk. Once a dominant force in smartphones, BlackBerry now holds just a sliver of the global smartphone market. Earlier this month it said it would cease production of its Classic handset, which uses its own BlackBerry 10 operating system.Chen last month expressed confidence the company's trimmed-down handset business can turn a profit by a self-imposed September deadline, even as some analysts urge the company to ditch the unit.A third Android device is expected from BlackBerry in the coming months.

128,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, November 01 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the Long-Term Issuer  Default Rating (IDR) on Best Buy Co., Inc. (Best Buy) at 'BBB-'. The Rating  Outlook is Stable. A full list of rating actions follows at the end of this  release. The ratings reflect Best Buy's significant progress over the past three years in  both managing its cost structure and stabilizing its revenue trajectory through  price-matching, enhanced vendor partnerships, and omnichannel investments. Best  Buy's efforts should allow it to maintain EBITDA in the $2.3 billion range and  generate $500 million to$600 million of free cash flow after dividends (FCF)  annually, yielding adjusted leverage in the high-2.0x range. Ratings continue to  be constrained by a still-challenging consumer electronics market, with  stagnant-to-negative growth and channel shifts to online and mobile  carrier-operated stores. KEY RATING DRIVERS Competitive Position Fortified Best Buy is using its real estate assets, broad product offering and existing  services infrastructure to strengthen customer relationships and capitalize on  anticipated growth in the connected home business. As a result of its efforts,  Best Buy has seen its comparable store sales (comps) improve to flattish in  recent years vs. -2% as recently as 2012. These results suggest market share  stabilization with gains in key categories, and Fitch expects flattish sales  trends to continue over the medium term. Best Buy's position as the remaining national consumer electronics retailer  allows it several advantages. Importantly, vendors have strengthened  partnerships with Best Buy, providing funding to support merchandising and  product display efforts. Vendors are using Best Buy's real estate and service  expertise to introduce new products and showcase functionality of existing  offerings. The company can also use its distribution infrastructure (including  its store network) and omnichannel capabilities to optimize supply chain  management, speed of delivery and in-store product pick-up, which comprises a  significant portion of the industry's online sales. Best Buy is employing its scale by investing in services business to deepen  relationships with customers and enable additional selling opportunities such as  installation and aftermarket care. All of these initiatives are supported by  Best Buy's price-match efforts, which eliminate the cost advantages of  discount-oriented competitors on like-products. EBITDA Stable with Substantial Cash Flow Management has achieved over $1.25 billion in expense reductions (with $250  million additional reductions announced), and savings are being reinvested into  growth initiatives and sharper prices. Cost management allowed Best Buy to grow  EBITDA from $2.0 billion in 2013 to $2.3 billion in 2015 despite modest declines  in sales and gross profit (driven largely by Canadian store closures). Continued  implementation of these reductions should support its pricing position and  EBITDA through 2016. At current EBITDA levels, the company is expected to  generate $500 million to $600 million in annual FCF after around $600 million in  capex and $400 to $500 million in regular dividends, and assuming neutral  working capital swings. As a result of substantial cash flow, the company can  comfortably balance business investments with shareholder returns. Industry Dynamics Remain Challenged Best Buy's substantial efforts are against the backdrop of a still-challenged  industry. Increased penetration of key categories such as smartphones, laptops  and tablets coupled with less pronounced product innovation cycles and device  convergence have caused stagnant-to-negative sector growth. Product categories  such as flat panel televisions and computing will likely remain in secular  decline until a significant innovation cycle occurs. With a strong product cycle  not currently anticipated, industry sales growth is expected to remain flattish  over the next 24 to 36 months. Compounding this issue for Best Buy has been increased competition from  lower-priced players, online merchants, and more recently the rise of cell phone  carrier-operated retail stores. Best Buy has responded to increased discount  competition by growing categories and product penetration where it has a  competitive service advantage, reducing selling prices using cost savings, and  investing in the online experience and distribution capabilities. The company  has effectively stemmed the competitive threat of low-priced players by  minimizing price differentials while reducing product-specific overlap. Cell phone carriers have emerged as a competitive threat to Best Buy due in part  to real estate expansion and changes to phone/service plans. While modest share  loss is expected over time, Best Buy can use its vendor relationships and  ability to price-compare plans as assets. While not currently expected, any  significant change in operating strategy on the part of the carriers could  impact Best Buy's comp outlook. However, given its broad product portfolio the  company should be able to maintain overall consumer electronics market share  despite any modest share loss here. Increased competition, especially from price-focused players, creates the risk  of higher promotional activity, particularly during periods with less customer  excitement around product innovation. During these periods, retailers may use  increased markdowns to drive sales volumes, yielding a deflationary environment  and Best Buy's EBITDA falling below the expected $2.2 billion to $2.3 billion  level. KEY ASSUMPTIONS --Fitch expects flattish domestic comps over the next 24 to36 months. --EBITDA is expected to remain around $2.2 billion to $2.3 billion with leverage  sustained in the high-2.0x range. --Fitch expects Best Buy to generate FCF at around $600 million in 2015 and $500  million to$600 million thereafter, assuming neutral working capital swings and  $400 million in regular dividends (plus an approximate $145 million in special  dividends in 2016). Fitch expects FCF will be deployed towards its  share-repurchase program. RATING SENSITIVITIES Negative Rating Action: A downgrade could be caused by worse-than-expected sales  declines of 2% or more for the domestic business versus Fitch's flattish  projections or material gross margin decline without any significant offset from  cost savings, resulting in EBITDA declining to around $1.8 billion and therefore  adjusted leverage increasing to the low-3x range. A downgrade would also result  from growth deceleration in Best Buy's focus categories, including mobile,  appliances, and services. Positive Rating Action: Fitch would need to see sustained momentum in comps  trends (+2%-3%) and EBITDA (near $2.5 billion) yielding leverage near 2.5x,  predicated on either market share gains or stabilization in consumer electronics  trends, to consider a positive rating action. LIQUIDITY Best Buy ended 2015 with $3.3 billion in cash and short-term investments, having  generated $200 million in FCF (post dividends) during the year. FCF in 2015 was  well below the comparable $1.1 billion figure in 2014 due to a timing-related  swing in working capital and a special dividend (approximately $180 million).  Additionally, the company has full availability on its $1.25 billion domestic  credit facility. Flattish same store sales should allow the company to generate  $500 million-$600 million in annual FCF in 2016-2018. Fitch expects FCF will be  increasingly deployed towards its share-repurchase program. The next maturity of unsecured notes is August 2018, which Best Buy could  refinance or pay down with cash on hand. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has affirmed the following ratings: --Long-Term IDR at 'BBB-';  --$1.25 billion bank credit facility at 'BBB-'; --$1.15 billion senior unsecured notes at 'BBB-'. The Outlook is Stable.

129,"   By Gayathree Ganesan  Best Buy Co Inc (BBY.N), the No. 1 U.S. electronics retailer, reported a better-than-expected rise in quarterly profit and same-store sales on Thursday, helped by higher online revenue and strong demand for TVs, home theaters and wearable devices.The retailer's forecast for full-year adjusted profit also beat analysts' expectations, sending its shares up 7.5 percent to $43.50 in early trading, their highest in three years.Best Buy, like home-improvement chains Home Depot Inc (HD.N) and Lowe's Inc (LOW.N), has benefited as a strong labor market and rising wages encourage homeowners to spend on their homes.The Richfield, Minnesota-based company said sales at established stores rose 1.8 percent in the third quarter ended Oct. 29, topping the 1 percent rise analysts on average had expected, according to research firm Consensus Metrix.Online revenue jumped 24.1 percent to $881 million, accounting for 9.8 percent of total revenue, as traffic increased and customers spent more per purchase.

Sales of appliances, which have also been helped by the housing market recovery, rose 3 percent on a comparable store basis. However, that paled against last year's increase of 16.4 percent, partly due to Samsung Electronics Co Ltd's (005930.KS) recall of 2.8 million washing machines, analysts said.Best Buy said the unavailability of some products due to recalls could drag down sales in the holiday shopping quarter by $200 million, to $13.4 billion-$13.6 billion.Analysts on average had expected Best Buy to report sales of $13.7 billion in the current quarter, which includes January, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
