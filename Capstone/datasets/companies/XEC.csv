1,"  * Q1 core profit up 74 pct, boosted by weaker euro* Exploration and production books 190 million euros loss* Refining up but not enough to offset cheap oil effect   (Adds new details, analysts, shares)By Julien ToyerMADRID, May 7 Repsol shares fell 3 percent on Thursday, despite a 74 percent rise in adjusted clean net profit for the first quarter, as the oil group's operating performance undershot analysts' expectations. Low energy prices, stalling production in Libya, currency adjustments in Brazil and higher exploration costs more than offset the positive impact of rising refining margins in Spain and encouraged investors to take profits after months when Repsol has outperformed the sector.Repsol is hoping to open a new chapter in 2015 after several years marked by boardroom battles and a corporate transformation which culminated in the purchase of Talisman Energy and the transfer last month of executive powers from Antonio Brufau to Josu Jon Imaz.While the integration of Talisman was a long-term strategic move for Repsol to grow in exploration and production, it had a first immediate impact on results as the dollar-denominated cash earmarked for the deal appreciated on the quarter and boosted core profits by 462 million euros ($525 million). With the currency effect stripped out, average recurring net profit, adjusted for inventory effects, came in at 466 million euros, below a market consensus of around 500 million euros and a 532 million euros reading last year.Shares in Repsol were down 3.7 percent to 17.75 euros at 0905 GMT, underperforming both Spain's blue-chip index Ibex  and the pan-European sector index. ""Our initial reaction is to look beyond the large corporate and other beat and focus more on the core Repsol operating units results, which we would consider a little weak in the context of high expectations,"" said Jefferies analysts in a note.The main reason for the miss was the exploration and production arm's 190 million euros loss in the quarter compared with a 255 million profit in the first three months of 2014.This was only partly offset by an 84 percent jump, to 534 million euros, of the domestic refining unit's profit as refining margins hit a record high of 8.7 dollars per barrel.The contribution of the Gas Natural stake to the results was stable to 122 million euros.

5,"  * Australia's Whitehaven beats profit forecasts* Strategy to bypass China pays off* Coal fetches premiums elsewhere in Asia   (Recasts with company strategy, ceo, analyst comments, shares)By James ReganSYDNEY, Aug 18 Australia's Whitehaven Coal Ltd  returned to the black and beat profit forecasts on Thursday, buoyed in part by a strategy that sidesteps a reliance on China for its high-quality coal.Shares in Whitehaven, the best performing stock in the benchmark ASX/S&P 200 index this year, have soared six-fold from February lows as it ramps up production and coal prices have started to shake off years of decline. The miner reported a net profit of A$20.5 million ($15.8 million) in fiscal 2016, beating forecasts around A$14.6 million, and up from a A$342.7 million loss last year as it wrote off exploration work and refinanced debt.Unlike larger rivals such as Peabody Energy, Glencore  and Anglo American, which are curtailing production or getting out of coal completely as China looks to cut its reliance on coal, Whitehaven has focused outside of China.It is boosting exports to customers in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, where it charges premiums of up to 10 percent for its higher quality, or cleaner burning, coal. ""All our customers are striving to produce more energy with lower CO2 and our coal is an important ingredient to achieve that,"" Chief Executive Paul Flynn told Reuters.The world supply of high energy, low ash and low sulphur coal is constrained, he said. And as markets return to supply and demand balance, Flynn is counting on the relative scarcity of this coal to continue to attract better pricing.There are more than 700 high efficiency, low emission (HELE) stations operating in Asia that rely on the type of coal Whitehaven is increasingly mining in Australia's Gunnedah Basin, with another 1,150 planned or under construction, industry figures show. HELE technology is being rolled in Southeast Asia, while North Asia has been on the path for some time, Flynn said.""We are now seeing Malaysia, Vietnam and the Philippines in particular starting to install the technology and they need cleaner coal to fire that technology.""Whitehaven's coal production jumped 30 percent in the year ended June 30, and it improved sales margins despite average lower selling prices over the year.The company said in its earnings release that coal prices now appear to have found a bottom and it remains ""cautiously optimistic"" about future prices.($1 = 1.2990 Australian dollars)   (Reporting by James Regan; Editing by Richard Pullin)",2016-08-18,XEC,"Thu Aug 18, 2016 | 3:27am EDT",UPDATE 2-Australian miner Whitehaven's ex-China coal strategy boosts profits,http://www.reuters.com//article/whitehaven-results-idUSL3N1AY571?type=companyNews
