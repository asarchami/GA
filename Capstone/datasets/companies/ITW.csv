0,"   By Greg Roumeliotis and Soyoung Kim | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Carlyle Group LP (CG.O) said it has agreed to buy Illinois Tool Works Inc's (ITW.N) industrial packaging unit for $3.2 billion, the private equity firm's latest acquisition of a large unit being carved out of conglomerates.The sale puts the Glenview, Illinois-based company well on its way to meeting its stated goal of divesting a quarter of its businesses in terms of revenue. Over the next few years, this will allow the company to focus on higher-margin businesses.Carlyle, which has a long track record of acquiring non-core businesses from companies and turning them around, prevailed over a rival bidder -- the consortium of Onex Corp OCX.TO and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) -- in the final stretch of the auction, Reuters reported earlier on Thursday.While Illinois Tool Works did not formally grant exclusivity to any of the bidders, it focused on negotiating final deal terms with Carlyle in the last two days, according to people familiar with the matter.Carlyle said it has secured committed debt financing from JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), Goldman Sachs Group (GS.N), Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAC.N), Barclays (BARC.L), Citigroup (C.N) and Credit Suisse Group CSGN.VX. Illinois Tool Works announced in September it was initiating a process to sell the industrial packaging unit, as the conglomerate continues to streamline its diversified business lines.The packaging business makes steel, plastic and paper products used for bundling, shipping and protecting transported goods, with brands including Signode, Strapex, Angleboard and Mima. The deal values the packaging business at around 8.5 times the unit's estimated 2014 earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, according to one person familiar with the transaction.Seeking to avoid frothy auctions for companies as markets rallied, private equity firms have shown a strong appetite for large units being carved out of companies seeking to exit non-core businesses.Those deals involve the creation of new companies and are complex. Firms with experience in executing corporate carve-outs feel they have an edge in such situations. Last month, Carlyle said it would acquire a clinical diagnostics unit from Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) for $4.15 billion.This followed Carlyle's acquisition in February 2013 of DuPont's performance coatings business for $4.9 billion, and its $3.46 billion acquisition of United Technologies Corp's (UTX.N) Hamilton Sundstrand industrial unit in 2012, along with buyout firm BC Partners Ltd.Kirkland & Ellis is legal advisor to Carlyle, while Latham & Watkins advised Illinois Tool Works on the transaction.(Reporting by Greg Roumeliotis and Soyoung Kim in New York; Editing by Stephen Powell and Diane Craft)",2014-02-06,ITW,"Thu Feb 6, 2014 | 6:22pm EST",Carlyle to buy Illinois Tool Works unit for $3.2 billion,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-itw-sale-idUSBREA151UQ20140206?type=companyNews

5,"   By Natalie Harrison  NEW YORK, Feb 7 (IFR) - Private equity group Carlyle is expected to fund its acquisition of Illinois Tool Works Inc's industrial packaging unit with around USD2.4bn-USD2.5bn of debt, according to market sources.Leverage is expected to be in the region of 6.75 times Ebitda, and the majority of the debt will be raised in the leveraged loan market, one of the sources said.The debt is expected to be split between around USD1.6bn-1.7bn of secured first-lien leveraged loans and around USD800-900m in unsecured high-yield bonds. Leverage on the loans is around 4.5 times Ebitda.""It's a great deal,"" said another source. ""The company has been disposing of assets and focusing on its core business. It gives the sponsor the opportunity to come in and refocus the enterprise and give managers new incentive.""Carlyle said late on Thursday that it had agreed to buy the business for USD3.2bn, and had secured committed debt financing from JP Morgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Barclays, Citigroup and Credit Suisse.Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan are the quarterbacks for the financing, the sources said. The timing of the deal is not yet certain, but it could come to market as soon as late March. Syndication of the bridge loan is expected to get under way soon.The remainder of the financing will come in the form of equity from the private equity group's USD13bn Carlyle Partners VI buyout fund. Leveraged finance bankers are hoping that a pick-up in mergers and acquisitions will help bolster fees in 2014.The issue is even more crucial this year amid expectations that high-yield bond supply will drop by at least 10% as fewer companies refinance their debt.Bankers expect more strategic acquisitions as corporates potentially spin-off non-core assets, but are less optimistic about leveraged buyouts increasing.""I wouldn't say that spin-offs like this are a trend, but there is bound to be more,"" said one of the sources.",2014-02-07,ITW,"Fri Feb 7, 2014 | 10:03am EST",Carlyle to raise USD2.4-2.5bn debt for Illinois deal,http://www.reuters.com//article/carlyle-illinois-debt-idUSL2N0LC0SX20140207?type=companyNews

13,"   By Patrick Temple-West | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The U.S. Internal Revenue Service and manufacturer Illinois Tool Works Inc are battling in U.S. Tax Court over a $356.8 million dispute that highlights a type of cross-border tax avoidance strategy facing increased scrutiny worldwide.As governments crack down on tax-driven profit-shifting,  the IRS is asserting that a loan used by Illinois Tool to bring foreign cash from a Bermuda-based subsidiary into the United States was not a tax-free transaction.Instead, the IRS argues that the transaction was a repatriation of foreign profits equivalent to a taxable dividend-style distribution.A victory for the IRS in the case would jeopardize similar transactions undertaken on a tax-free basis, tax lawyers say.“This is foreign tax planning 101 ... Every Fortune 500 company in America that is multinational does this,” said Jasper Cummings, a tax lawyer for Alston & Bird LLP, who reviewed the case for Reuters.""If the IRS wins this, it will be a hell of a win,"" he said. The Glenview, Illinois-based diversified manufacturer, which makes everything from vehicle parts to food service equipment to arc welding tools, filed its Tax Court petition last month, challenging the tax agency's position.Illinois Tool said it could owe $70 million if it loses the case, according to a May regulatory filing. No trial date has been scheduled.Both the company and the IRS declined to comment on Friday.In 2006, Illinois Tool needed cash in the United States to retire outstanding commercial paper and fund acquisitions, according to the company's court filing. The filing said Illinois Tool decided to repatriate cash from its roughly $6.4 billion of earnings held overseas.The company structured the transaction as a loan, with a maturity date and a fixed interest rate. But in 2010 the IRS uncharacterized the loan as a taxable dividend, the filing said.The case comes amid growing scrutiny of international corporate tax issues. An anti-tax avoidance project is under way at the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. Known as the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) project, the effort calls for revising tax treaties, tightening rules and increasing government tax information sharing. The OECD is expected to make BEPS recommendations to the Group of 20 economies by the end of next year.""Repatriation is becoming an increasingly significant issue,"" said Miriam Fisher, co-chair of the tax controversy practice at law firm Latham & Watkins LLP.""It will be the subject of coming litigation and this case certainly brings the issue to the forefront,"" she said.The case is Illinois Tool Works Inc & Subsidiaries v.
