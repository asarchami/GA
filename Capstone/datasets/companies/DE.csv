0,"  OSAKA, Japan Jan 22 Japan's Kubota Corp  plans to sell powerful, large tractors in North America and Europe next year, its president said on Wednesday, challenging farm equipment industry leader Deere & Co.Yasuo Masumoto, president of Japan's biggest farm equipment maker, told Reuters Kubota was seeking a joint venture with a European or U.S. company this year to produce the tractors, which will have a horsepower of at least 200.The company had previously raised the prospect of adding the 200 horsepower tractors to its line-up through acquisitions, but Masumoto said that route would take too much time. ""There's no progress on an acquisition and we have to get into big machines,"" he said, adding that Kubota is targeting sales of about 300 units of these larger tractors in the year to March 2016.The North American market for large tractors is dominated by U.S.-based Deere, CNH Industrial NV and AGCO Corp , while the main companies in Europe include unlisted Claas KGaA mbH. Kubota is currently one of the world's biggest manufacturers of equipment used in paddy farming, but it wants to expand into the market for dry field crops such as wheat, corn and soybeans, which globally cover about four times the land area used for rice cultivation. The company's tractors currently go up to 135 horsepower at most, which is insufficient for large farms.Last year, Kubota invested 40.3 million euros ($55 million)in a new plant in northern France that will begin producing up to 170 horsepower tractors in April 2015 for the North American and European markets.",2014-01-22,DE,"Wed Jan 22, 2014 | 6:00am EST",Japan's Kubota eyes U.S. fields with larger tractors,http://www.reuters.com//article/kubota-expansion-idUSL3N0KW3D120140122?type=companyNews
1,"   By James B. Kelleher  Deere & Co (DE.N) posted a stronger-than-expected quarterly profit on Wednesday but kept its full-year forecast unchanged, indicating the challenges the farm equipment industry faces as commodity prices come off the record highs of recent years.The Moline, Illinois-based company said cost controls had helped offset the effects of moderating demand for its tractors, harvesters and other agricultural machinery in the most recent quarter.Deere, the world's largest maker of farm equipment, said it had earned $681.1 million, or $1.81 a share, in the first quarter ended January 31, up from $649.7 million, or $1.65 a share, a year earlier.Analysts on average expected a profit of $1.52 a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue, including from financial services, rose 3 percent to $7.65 billion.Deere said it still expected equipment sales to fall 3 percent in fiscal 2014 and that it would post a full-year profit of about $3.3 billion, down from $3.54 billion last year. Farmers are expected to throttle back on purchases of new vehicles this year following a bumper crop that sent commodity prices lower.Analysts now expect crop receipts, which tend to correlate with farm equipment purchases, to fall as much as 10 percent this year. William Blair & Co analyst Lawrence De Maria said Deere's unwillingness to raise its forecast despite the stronger-than-expected results reflected deteriorating farm fundamentals, especially in North America.

8,"  (Adds details on South America and the Commonwealth of Independent States; updates share movement)By James B. KelleherMay 14 Deere & Co on Wednesday reported a stronger-than-expected quarterly profit but trimmed its outlook for full-year sales of farm equipment, citing deteriorating conditions in South America and the former Soviet Union.Sales of the company's green-and-yellow tractors and harvesters fell a worse-than-expected 12 percent during the second quarter ended on April 30, Deere said, but cost cuts, a lower-than-expected tax rate and improved margins in its construction equipment unit helped offset that weakness.Deere also stuck by its full-year profit forecast despite growing weakness in Argentina, where it said import tariffs were hurting tractor sales, and Brazil, where contracting margins in the sugar cane industry were discouraging capital investment.In the Commonwealth of Independent States, Deere said geopolitical tensions between Russia and Ukraine were disrupting farm credit in the region, putting the 2014 crop at risk.The company said sales in Kazakhstan, Belarus and Russia were also hurt by import policies. It did not elaborate. Sales in the region will fall ""significantly"" this year, Deere said. It had previously said they would be ""down slightly.""The company, the world's largest maker of farm equipment, had already signaled that demand for its products would fall in most markets this year following a bumper crop that sent commodity prices down.Lower commodity prices hurt Deere and its rivals because they shrink farm incomes and discourage investment in new equipment. On Wednesday, Deere said the weakness would be greater than it expected, with sales of agricultural equipment down about 7 percent in fiscal 2014. Three months ago, it said it expected a decline of about 6 percent.""The execution was terrific during the quarter, but the signs of a cyclical peak are growing,"" said Longbow Research analyst Eli Lustgarten. Some investors hoped a rebound in construction demand, particularly in the United States, would help offset that softness for Deere, which also makes equipment for builders.But Deere also scaled back its outlook for that industry on Wednesday. Although it held to the forecast for its own construction sales, it cut its expectation for total U.S. construction investment growth to a 4.3 percent annual rate for 2014 from 6.3 percent.The company also reduced its forecast for 2014 U.S. housing starts by nearly 10 percent to 1.05 million.Deere posted a second-quarter profit of $980.7 million, or $2.65 a share, down from $1.08 billion, or $2.76 a share, a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected $2.48 a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Revenue fell 9 percent to $9.95 billion.Shares of Deere, which have outperformed the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index so far this year, were down 2.3 percent at $91.50 in afternoon trading.

14,"   By James B. Kelleher  Deere & Co posted a lower quarterly profit on Wednesday and cut its full-year outlook as declining grain prices discouraged farmers from purchasing its tractors, harvesters and other agricultural machinery.The Moline, Illinois-based company, the world's largest maker of farm equipment, said it now expects to earn $3.1 billion in fiscal 2014, down from its previous forecast of $3.3 billion.The company said it expects total U.S. farm cash receipts, which correlate closely with investment in new ag equipment, to fall to $387.1 billion in 2014, down from $407.1 billion in 2013 and below its previous forecast of $392.7 billion.Ann Duignan, an analyst at JP Morgan, said the company's forecast, which came just one day after the U.S. Department of Agriculture released its World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates, remained ""overly bullish.""The USDA predicted U.S. corn production will top the 14 billion-bushel mark for the first time ever this year. It also said it expects the U.S. soybean crop to come in at a record of 3.82 billion bushels, up 16 percent.The prospect of a bumper crop has sent corn and soybean prices plummeting and soured farmers on making new capital investments in their operations. Deere also cut its forecast for South America, where rising interest rates in Brazil and tight credit in Argentina are hurting sales.Deere said it now expects full-year industry sales in the region to fall 15 percent in 2014, down from a previously forecast decline of 10 percent. Lawrence De Maria, an analyst at William Blair & Co., said the lowered outlook proved that Deere, which outperformed rivals Agco and CNH in previous quarters because of strong back orders, was ""not immune"" to the deteriorating fundamentals in the sector. The company also repeated the warning it issued earlier this year that sales in the countries that once formed the Soviet Union would be “down significantly” in 2014 as a result of “geopolitical uncertainty” in the region.  In a statement, Deere Chairman and Chief Executive Sam Allen said the company was scaling back production in line with falling global demand for its agricultural products. The one bright spot in Deere’s core farm market was the U.S. livestock sector, where the company said rising meat and poultry prices were driving sales of smaller tractors and helping to moderate the weakness in the grains sector. For the most recent quarter ended July 31, Deere reported a net profit of $850.7 million, or $2.33 a share, compared with $996.5 million, or $2.56 a share, a year earlier.Sales fell 5 percent to $9.5 billion.The quarterly results were better than expected and reflected strong sales of the company's construction and forestry equipment.Shares of Deere, which have underperformed the wider market this year, were down 1 percent at $85.44 in early trading.

25,"  (Adds details, shares)Sept 23 Deere & Co, the world's largest farm equipment maker, said it was exploring strategic options for its low-margin crop insurance business and had hired Citigroup as its adviser.The company said no formal decisions had been made and no agreements had been reached yet.The business underwrites policies through John Deere Insurance Co, offering protection to farmers from losses stemming from a variety of causes such as natural disasters and declines in crop prices. The insurance business is a part of the company's financial services arm. Financial services accounted for 7 percent of Deere's total revenue of $9.5 billion in the third quarter ended July 31.Deere, along with rivals Agco Corp and Titan Machinery Inc, has been struggling with falling demand for its farm equipment as low corn prices and a bumper crop in 2013 have hurt farmers' ability to spend on new machinery. The company said in August that it would lay off more than 600 employees at its plants in Illinois, Iowa and Kansas. The U.S. Department of Agriculture expects 2014 crop supply to increase faster than demand for corn, soybeans and wheat in the United States, which could further discourage farmers from investing in tractors, harvesters and other agricultural machinery.Illinois-based Deere could not be reached for comment on the specific nature of the strategic options it was exploring.Deere' shares were trading down 0.4 percent at $83.43 on Tuesday. Up to Monday's close, the stock had fallen 8.3 percent this year.

27,"  (Adds statement from Climate Corp, adds link to data security policy)By Karl PlumeNov 13 A consortium of farmer organizations and agriculture data technology providers on Thursday published a set of data privacy and security principles aimed at reassuring farmers that data they share with Big Data services providers will not be misused.The non-binding principles are also meant to provide companies that collect, store and analyze farmer data some guidelines when crafting their service contracts and marketing tools that use farm data to boost crop yields or reduce costs for farmers.The principles were developed after a pair of meetings organized by the American Farm Bureau Federation (AFBF) with industry groups including the American Soybean Association and National Corn Growers Association as well as tech providers like John Deere, DuPont Pioneer and Monsanto's  Climate Corporation. Although the guidelines closely mirror already published policies of many data services providers, approval by the AFBF and other farmer organizations could help soothe some farmer concerns about data misuse. The effort could be particularly beneficial for the larger data services providers, often the focus of farmer mistrust.""It's an important step in making farmers more comfortable with these emerging data science technologies that can provide real value for their operations,"" said Anthony Osborne, marketing vice president for the Climate Corporation, an early leader in the industry. Climate and other companies are hoping to cash in on services that combine everything from how densely farmers plant seeds, row-by-row soil conditions and local weather patterns to help farmers increase crop output.Some farmers have worried commodity markets and farmland values could be manipulated if their data winds up in the hands of traders or land brokers. Others fear large seed and chemical companies could use the information to sell more fertilizer and seeds.""The principles released today provide a measure of needed certainty to farmers regarding the protection of their data,"" said AFBF President Bob Stallman.Among the guidelines are assertions that farmers own information generated by their operations, farmers should be told how their data will be used and who it is shared with, and farmers should be able to opt out of services and have their data returned to them if they choose.

Deere, which also makes construction equipment, said it expected overall machinery sales to fall about 21 percent in the first quarter ending Jan. 31.Net income attributable to the company fell to $649.2 million, or $1.83 per share, in the fourth quarter ended Oct. 31 from $806.8 million, or $2.11 per share, a year earlier.Revenue fell 5 percent to $8.97 billion.Deere's shares were down 2 percent at $85.87 in trading before the bell.Up to Tuesday's close, the stock had risen about 11 percent from its two year-low of $78.88 touched on Oct. 8.

51,"  (Recasts, adds analyst comment, includes background, other portfolio changes)NEW YORK Feb 17 Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc on Tuesday disclosed a 5 percent stake in agricultural equipment maker Deere & Co and said it shed a $3.74 billion investment in oil company Exxon Mobil Corp  as oil prices plunged.The changes were among several that Berkshire made in its common stock investments in the fourth quarter, according to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing detailing the conglomerate's domestic equity investments as of Dec. 31.Berkshire began accumulating the bulk of its 17.1 million-share stake in Deere, worth $1.51 billion at year end, in the third quarter of 2014, but had not previously disclosed it. The SEC often lets Buffett quietly accumulate large stakes to deter copycats.Deere shares rose 1.2 percent in after-market trading.Shares of companies often rise after Berkshire reveals new investments because some investors consider it a vote of confidence by Buffett and try to copy him. Deere declined to comment.Berkshire's decision to dispose of its entire 41 million-share stake in Exxon Mobil was unusual for Berkshire because the stake had been recently acquired, dating only to 2013.Exxon shares have outperformed many peers in recent months, losing only about 15 percent of their value from June through January as oil prices slumped by more than half. It is unclear why Buffett appeared to have soured on Exxon, or whether Berkshire made money on the investment.Buffett ""is of course a value investor, and the fact of the matter is that Exxon shares held up extremely well during the oil price meltdown,"" said Raymond James energy analyst Pavel Molchanov in an interview.Exxon Mobil declined to comment. Berkshire also reported a new stake of 4.7 million shares in Rupert Murdoch's media company Twenty-First Century Fox Inc .It further reported a new 8.4 million-share stake in Restaurant Brands International Inc , the parent of the Burger King and Tim Hortons restaurant chains. Berkshire helped finance Burger King's purchase of Tim Hortons last year and got Restaurant Brands shares through the merger.Berkshire also added to holdings in IBM Corp, General Motors Co, Phillips 66, Suncor Energy Inc  and DirecTV, among others, and shed stakes in oil company ConocoPhillips and pharmacy benefits management company Express Scripts Holding Co.U.S. regulators require large investors to disclose their stock holdings every quarter.Berkshire, based in Omaha, Nebraska, owns more than 80 businesses ranging from Dairy Queen ice cream to Geico insurance to the BNSF railroad.

52,"  Farm equipment maker Deere & Co (DE.N) posted a 43 percent fall in first-quarter profit and cut its full-year profit forecast as lower corn prices and weak farm income weighed on demand for agricultural machinery.Deere's shares were down 1.9 percent at $90.00 in premarket trading on Friday.The company, which gets nearly two-thirds of its revenue from farm and turf machinery, cut its 2015 net profit forecast to $1.8 billion from $1.9 billion.Sales of Moline, Illinois-based Deere's farm and turf machinery are expected to fall 23 percent globally this year, it said. This includes a 4 percent negative impact of a strong dollar. The company earlier forecast a sales fall of 20 percent.The company also has operations in Canada, Brazil, China, France, Germany, India, Russia and South Africa among others. The United States and Canada accounted for 62 percent of total revenue in 2014. Deere's overall equipment sales are expected to fall about 19 percent in the current quarter ending April 30.The company's sales have been hit as bumper corn harvests drive down prices, leaving farmers with less cash to spend on equipment. Corn prices fell about 15 percent in 2014, on top of a decline of nearly 40 percent in 2013.The U.S. Department of Agriculture said last week that net farm income is expected to fall 32 percent to $73.6 billion in 2015, the lowest since 2009 and a drop of nearly 43 percent from the record high of $129 billion in 2013. Net income attributable to Deere fell to $387 million, or $1.12 per share, in the first quarter ended Jan. 31, from $681 million, or $1.81 per share, a year earlier.Sales fell 16.6 percent to $6.38 billion. Analysts on average had expected earnings of 83 cents per share on revenue $5.53 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Up to Thursday's close, the company's stock had risen about 8 percent in the past 12 months, compared with an about 11 percent rise in the Dow Jones US Industrial Goods & Services .DJUSIG index.

53,"  * Investors look for signs of progress in Greece deal* Deere shares fall after results, Intuit rises* Dow down 0.1 pct, S&P down 0.2 pct, Nasdaq flat   (Updates to midday trading)By Ryan VlastelicaNEW YORK, Feb 20 U.S. stocks fell on Friday, with the Nasdaq set to break a seven-session streak of gains, amid ongoing uncertainty over negotiations for a debt deal in Greece.In a positive sign, the new prime minister of Greece said he was certain that euro zone finance ministers would accept Athens' request for an extended loan, while Germany seemed to soften its tone after earlier this week rejecting Greece's proposal for a loan extension.However, Maltese Finance Minister Edward Scicluna told the weekly Malta Today that the EU's biggest countries may be prepared to let Greece leave the euro zone. The CBOE Volatility index rose 3.4 percent, but at 15.81, the so-called ""fear index"" remains below its long-term average around 20.While U.S. equities have little direct exposure to Greece, a relatively small economy in the euro zone, Wall Street has risen recently on any sign of progress in reaching an accord. Investors are concerned that if no deal is reached, potentially forcing Greece out of the euro zone, that will lead to extended volatility with a major trading partner.""We're not pricing in dramatic risk from Greece, but the fear is that if Greece leaves the euro zone, that would just be the first domino to fall in a catastrophe,"" said Tom Digenan, head of U.S. equities at UBS Global Asset Management in Chicago. ""Everyone is trying to avoid that, but from the German perspective, you don't want to give too much away and set a bad precedent.""Deere & Co fell 0.6 percent to $91.14 after the farm equipment maker reported a 43-percent drop in quarterly profit, hurt by a decline in sales.Noodles & Co plunged 28 percent to $19.90 in heavy trading after the fast-casual restaurant chain operator's adjusted profit outlook was below expectations. On the upside, Intuit Inc rose 5.5 percent to $96.16 a day after reporting a smaller-than-expected quarterly loss.The Dow Jones industrial average fell 11.76 points, or 0.07 percent, to 17,974.01, the S&P 500 lost 3.28 points, or 0.16 percent, to 2,094.17 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 2.17 points, or 0.04 percent, to 4,926.87.For the week, the Dow is down 0.2 percent, the S&P 500 is down 0.1 percent and the Nasdaq up 0.7 percent. The Nasdaq has risen for seven straight sessions and is nearing its March 2000 all-time high, reached prior to the bursting of the dot-com bubble.""The market isn't cheap, but we're cheap relative to other asset classes like Treasuries,"" said Digenan, who helps oversee about $6.5 billion. ""We're at fair value, which implies returns of 7 or 8 percent, which is pretty strong, but don't expect to get that without risk.""Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 1,451 to 1,447, for a 1.00-to-1 ratio; on the Nasdaq, 1,444 issues fell and 1,052 advanced, a 1.37-to-1 ratio.The S&P 500 was posting 28 new 52-week highs and 2 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite was recording 54 new highs and 11 new lows.

However, Maltese Finance Minister Edward Scicluna told the weekly Malta Today that the EU's biggest countries may be prepared to let Greece leave the euro zone.While U.S. equities have little direct exposure to Greece, a relatively small economy in the euro zone, Wall Street has risen recently on any sign of progress in reaching an accord.

56,"  (Adds details, background, shares)Feb 20 Farm equipment maker Deere & Co  posted a 43 percent fall in first-quarter profit and cut its full-year profit forecast as lower corn prices and weak farm income weighed on demand for agricultural machinery.Deere's shares were down 1.9 percent at $90.00 in premarket trading on Friday.The company, which gets nearly two-thirds of its revenue from farm and turf machinery, cut its 2015 net profit forecast to $1.8 billion from $1.9 billion.Sales of Moline, Illinois-based Deere's farm and turf machinery are expected to fall 23 percent globally this year, it said. This includes a 4 percent negative impact of a strong dollar. The company earlier forecast a sales fall of 20 percent. The company also has operations in Canada, Brazil, China, France, Germany, India, Russia and South Africa among others. The United States and Canada accounted for 62 percent of total revenue in 2014.Deere's overall equipment sales are expected to fall about 19 percent in the current quarter ending April 30. The company's sales have been hit as bumper corn harvests drive down prices, leaving farmers with less cash to spend on equipment. Corn prices fell about 15 percent in 2014, on top of a decline of nearly 40 percent in 2013.The U.S. Department of Agriculture said last week that net farm income is expected to fall 32 percent to $73.6 billion in 2015, the lowest since 2009 and a drop of nearly 43 percent from the record high of $129 billion in 2013. (1.usa.gov/17yUdcj) Net income attributable to Deere fell to $387 million, or $1.12 per share, in the first quarter ended Jan. 31, from $681 million, or $1.81 per share, a year earlier.Sales fell 16.6 percent to $6.38 billion.Analysts on average had expected earnings of 83 cents per share on revenue $5.53 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Up to Thursday's close, the company's stock had risen about 8 percent in the past 12 months, compared with an about 11 percent rise in the Dow Jones US Industrial Goods & Services  index.

60,"   By Jo Winterbottom and P.J. Huffstutter | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Across the U.S. Midwest, the plunge in grain prices to near four-year lows is pitting landowners determined to sustain rental incomes against farmer tenants worried about making rent payments because their revenues are squeezed.Some grain farmers already see the burden as too big. They are taking an extreme step, one not widely seen since the 1980s: breaching lease contracts, reducing how much land they will sow this spring and risking years-long legal battles with landlords.The tensions add to other signs the agricultural boom that the U.S. grain farming sector has enjoyed for a decade is over. On Friday, tractor maker John Deere cut its profit forecast citing falling sales caused by lower farm income and grain prices.Many rent payments – which vary from a few thousand dollars for a tiny farm to millions for a major operation – are due on March 1, just weeks after the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) estimated net farm income, which peaked at $129 billion in 2013, could slide by almost a third this year to $74 billion.The costs of inputs, such as fertilizer and seeds, are remaining stubbornly high, the strong dollar is souring exports and grain prices are expected to stay low.How many people are walking away from leases they had committed to is not known. In Iowa, the nation's top corn and soybean producer, one real estate expert says that out of the estimated 100,000 farmland leases in the state, 1,000 or more could be breached by this spring.The stakes are high because huge swaths of agricultural land are leased: As of 2012, in the majority of counties in the Midwest Corn Belt and the grain-growing Plains, at least 40 percent of farmland was leased or rented out, USDA data shows.""It's hard to know where the bottom is on this,"" said David Miller, Iowa Farm Bureau's director of research and commodity services.SIGNS OF TROUBLE  Grain production is, however, unlikely to be affected in any major way yet as landowners will rather have someone working their land, even at reduced rates, than let it lie fallow.But prolonged weakness in the farm economy could send ripples far and wide: as farms consolidate, ""there would be fewer machinery dealers, fewer elevators, and so-on through the rural economy,"" said Craig Dobbins, professor of agricultural economics at Purdue University.Possibly also fewer new farmers. Jon Sparks farms about 1,400 acres of family land and rented ground in Indiana. His nephew wants to return to work on the farm but margins are tight and land rents high. Sparks cannot make it work financially.""We can't grow without overextending ourselves,"" Sparks said. ""I don't know what to do.""Landowners are reluctant to cut rents. Some are retirees who partly rely on the rental income from the land they once farmed, and the rising number of realty investors want to maintain returns. Landlords have also seen tenants spend on new machinery and buildings during the boom and feel renters should still be able to afford lease payments. ""As cash rent collections start this spring, I expect to see more farm operators who have had difficulty acquiring adequate financing either let leases go or try and renegotiate terms,"" said Jim Farrell, president of Farmers National Co, which manages about 4,900 farms across 24 states for land-owners.Take an 80-acre (32 hectare) farm in Madison County, Iowa, owned by a client of Peoples Company, a farmland manager. The farmer who rented the land at $375 an acre last year offered $315 for this year, said Steve Bruere, president of the company. The owner turned him down, and rented it to a neighbor for $325 -- plus a hefty bonus if gross income tops $750.There are growing numbers of other examples. Miller, of the Iowa Farm Bureau, said he learned about a farmer near Marshalltown, in central Iowa, who had walked away from 650 acres (263 hectares) of crop ground because he could not pay the rent. Just days later, he was told a north-central Iowa farmer breached his lease on 6,500 acres.COURTS OR LOANS  Concern about broken leases has some landlords reviewing legal options, according to Roger A. McEowen, director of the Iowa State University Center for Agricultural Law and Taxation. His staff began fielding phone calls from nervous landowners last autumn.One catch is that many landlords never thought to file the paperwork to put a lien on their tenants' assets. That means landowners ""can't go grab anything off the farm if the tenant doesn't pay,"" McEowen said. ""It also means that they're going to be behind the bank.""Still, farmers could have a tough time walking away from their leases, said Kelvin Leibold, a farm management specialist at Iowa State University extension.""People want their money. They want to get paid. I expect we will see some cases going to court over this,"" he added.To avoid such a scenario, farmers have begun turning to banks for loans that will help fund operations and conserve their cash. Operating loans for farmers jumped 37 percent in the fourth quarter of 2014 over a year ago to $54 billion, according to survey-based estimates in the Kansas City Federal Reserve bank's latest Agricultural Finance Databook.Loans with an undefined purpose -- which might be used for rents, according to the bank's assistant vice-president Nathan Kauffman -- nearly doubled in the fourth quarter of 2014 from a year earlier to $25 billion. Total non-real estate farm loan volumes jumped more than 50 percent for the quarter, to $112 billion.""It's all about working capital and bankers are stressing working capital,"" said Sam Miller, managing director of agricultural banking at BMO Harris Bank. ""Liquidity has tightened up considerably in the last year.""

62,"   By Jo Winterbottom and P.J. Huffstutter | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Feb 23 Across the U.S. Midwest, the plunge in grain prices to near four-year lows is pitting landowners determined to sustain rental incomes against farmer tenants worried about making rent payments because their revenues are squeezed.Some grain farmers already see the burden as too big. They are taking an extreme step, one not widely seen since the 1980s: breaching lease contracts, reducing how much land they will sow this spring and risking years-long legal battles with landlords.The tensions add to other signs the agricultural boom that the U.S. grain farming sector has enjoyed for a decade is over. On Friday, tractor maker John Deere cut its profit forecast citing falling sales caused by lower farm income and grain prices.Many rent payments - which vary from a few thousand dollars for a tiny farm to millions for a major operation - are due on March 1, just weeks after the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) estimated net farm income, which peaked at $129 billion in 2013, could slide by almost a third this year to $74 billion.The costs of inputs, such as fertilizer and seeds, are remaining stubbornly high, the strong dollar is souring exports and grain prices are expected to stay low.How many people are walking away from leases they had committed to is not known. In Iowa, the nation's top corn and soybean producer, one real estate expert says that out of the estimated 100,000 farmland leases in the state, 1,000 or more could be breached by this spring.The stakes are high because huge swaths of agricultural land are leased: As of 2012, in the majority of counties in the Midwest Corn Belt and the grain-growing Plains, at least 40 percent of farmland was leased or rented out, USDA data shows.""It's hard to know where the bottom is on this,"" said David Miller, Iowa Farm Bureau's director of research and commodity services.SIGNS OF TROUBLE  Grain production is, however, unlikely to be affected in any major way yet as landowners will rather have someone working their land, even at reduced rates, than let it lie fallow.But prolonged weakness in the farm economy could send ripples far and wide: as farms consolidate, ""there would be fewer machinery dealers, fewer elevators, and so-on through the rural economy,"" said Craig Dobbins, professor of agricultural economics at Purdue University.Possibly also fewer new farmers.Jon Sparks farms about 1,400 acres of family land and rented ground in Indiana. His nephew wants to return to work on the farm but margins are tight and land rents high. Sparks cannot make it work financially.""We can't grow without overextending ourselves,"" Sparks said. ""I don't know what to do."" Landowners are reluctant to cut rents. Some are retirees who partly rely on the rental income from the land they once farmed, and the rising number of realty investors want to maintain returns. Landlords have also seen tenants spend on new machinery and buildings during the boom and feel renters should still be able to afford lease payments.""As cash rent collections start this spring, I expect to see more farm operators who have had difficulty acquiring adequate financing either let leases go or try and renegotiate terms,"" said Jim Farrell, president of Farmers National Co, which manages about 4,900 farms across 24 states for land-owners.Take an 80-acre (32 hectare) farm in Madison County, Iowa, owned by a client of Peoples Company, a farmland manager. The farmer who rented the land at $375 an acre last year offered $315 for this year, said Steve Bruere, president of the company. The owner turned him down, and rented it to a neighbor for $325 -- plus a hefty bonus if gross income tops $750.There are growing numbers of other examples. Miller, of the Iowa Farm Bureau, said he learned about a farmer near Marshalltown, in central Iowa, who had walked away from 650 acres (263 hectares) of crop ground because he could not pay the rent. Just days later, he was told a north-central Iowa farmer breached his lease on 6,500 acres. COURTS OR LOANS Concern about broken leases has some landlords reviewing legal options, according to Roger A. McEowen, director of the Iowa State University Center for Agricultural Law and Taxation. His staff began fielding phone calls from nervous landowners last autumn.One catch is that many landlords never thought to file the paperwork to put a lien on their tenants' assets. That means landowners ""can't go grab anything off the farm if the tenant doesn't pay,"" McEowen said. ""It also means that they're going to be behind the bank.""Still, farmers could have a tough time walking away from their leases, said Kelvin Leibold, a farm management specialist at Iowa State University extension.""People want their money. They want to get paid. I expect we will see some cases going to court over this,"" he added.To avoid such a scenario, farmers have begun turning to banks for loans that will help fund operations and conserve their cash. Operating loans for farmers jumped 37 percent in the fourth quarter of 2014 over a year ago to $54 billion, according to survey-based estimates in the Kansas City Federal Reserve bank's latest Agricultural Finance Databook.Loans with an undefined purpose -- which might be used for rents, according to the bank's assistant vice-president Nathan Kauffman -- nearly doubled in the fourth quarter of 2014 from a year earlier to $25 billion.Total non-real estate farm loan volumes jumped more than 50 percent for the quarter, to $112 billion.""It's all about working capital and bankers are stressing working capital,"" said Sam Miller, managing director of agricultural banking at BMO Harris Bank.

63,"  (Adds details of holdings, comment, byline)By Jonathan StempelMay 15 Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc  on Friday said it has boosted its holdings in some of the billionaire's favorite companies, including Wells Fargo & Co  and International Business Machines Corp.The changes were disclosed in a regulatory filing detailing Berkshire's U.S.-listed stock portfolio as of March 31.Berkshire also boosted its share stake in U.S. Bancorp , another large holding, while other portfolio managers adjusted their stakes in several companies.No new stocks were added to the portfolio, which shrank to $107.1 billion from $109.4 billion in December. Berkshire bought $1.62 billion and sold $1.11 billion of equities overall. Buffett has long praised his ""Big Four"" stock holdings Wells Fargo, IBM, Coca-Cola Co and American Express Co, which comprise roughly 58 percent of Berkshire's equity investments.Buffett has stuck with them despite recent adversity including IBM's stagnant stock price, concern over Coca-Cola's sugary products and executive pay structure, and a February court ruling that American Express violated antitrust law. ""Too many fund managers are more interested in seeing stocks to which they have committed perform well"" in the short term, said Andy Kern, a University of Missouri professor who teaches a class on Buffett's investment strategies. ""Berkshire has such a long time horizon that it can afford to watch the stock price go down so it can buy more.""Friday's regulatory filing does not disclose who makes which investment at Berkshire. Smaller investments are often made by portfolio managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, who may succeed Buffett as chief investment officers after he departs.In the first quarter, Berkshire raised its stake in Wells Fargo by about 2 percent to 470.3 million shares, and in IBM by roughly 3 percent to 79.6 million shares. The U.S. Bancorp stake grew about 5 percent to 83.8 million shares. Other holdings that grew include Deere & Co, Liberty Global Plc, Phillips 66, Precision Castparts Corp and Twenty-First Century Fox Inc.Holdings declined in Bank of New York Mellon Corp, Charter Communications Inc, National Oilwell Varco Inc , Viacom Inc and Wabco Holdings Inc.Berkshire also owns more than 80 businesses, including the Burlington Northern railroad, Dairy Queen ice cream and Geico car insurance.Buffett, 84, this month celebrated his 50th anniversary running his Omaha, Nebraska-based company, whose market value is fifth-highest among publicly-traded U.S. companies.

Founded a year ago, FBN plans to help farmers make better decisions about crops by analyzing weather and soil information, as well as other data gathered by sensor-laden farm equipment. It can then offer recommendations on inputs such as seed, fertilizer and chemicals.""We offer real-world, Consumer Reports-like data. We can show farmers how seeds actually performed on farms, not how they performed in university trials or highly controlled seed company trials,"" Charles Baron, co-founder and vice president of products at FBN, said in a telephone interview. The Silicon Valley-based company is not currently creating planting prescriptions for farmers, but Baron said that could happen in the future.Big agriculture companies such as Monsanto Co and Deere & Co have been investing heavily in data analysis products and precision agriculture software, as well as tools that help farmers grow crops more efficiently. Investors have also been pouring money into agriculture technology startups, with $2.36 billion raised across 264 financing deals in 2014, according to an annual report by AgFunder.com.The investments come as farming profitability is projected to fall to the lowest since 2007, and as U.S. farmers cut back on inputs such as machinery and fertilizer to save money.In 2011, Google Ventures and Khosla Ventures invested $42 million in WeatherBill, which later became The Climate Corporation.

79,"  (Adds Deere comment in paragraph seven)By Dan LevineOct 27 Car owners and security experts can tinker with automobile software without incurring some U.S. copyright liability, according to new guidelines issued this month that had been opposed by the auto industry.The Library of Congress, which oversees the U.S. Copyright Office, agreed with fair use advocates who argued that vehicle owners are entitled to modify their cars, which often involves altering software.Automakers including General Motors Co, and other vehicle manufacturers such as Deere & Co, opposed the rules. They said vehicle owners could visit authorized repair shops for changes they may need to undertake.However, U.S. copyright officials decided that altering computer programs for vehicle repair or modification may not infringe a manufacturer's software copyright. A GM representative referred to a statement from an industry group that said the new rules would weaken safety innovation.""Sensitive vehicle data could be easily manipulated, altered, or distributed - undetected - if these changes are implemented,"" the statement said. Deere spokesman Ken Golden said the company stands by its earlier opposition. However, some systems that transmit data from the vehicle to Deere could still be protected by copyright, Golden said.Security researchers also pushed for copyright liability protection because computer programs are ""pervasive"" in modern machines and devices, including vehicles, home appliances and medical devices.""We are pleased that analysts will now be able to examine the software in the cars we drive without facing legal threats from car manufacturers,"" said Kit Wilson, a staff attorney for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which advocated for the rule changes. The new rules must be renewed in three years, Wilson said. Vehicle owners still cannot perform other activities that would violate an automaker's copyright, he said, like extracting code and selling it.Some U.S. government agencies expressed serious reservations about the new rules, and the Environmental Protection Agency flatly opposed them.""EPA explained that vehicle modifications are often performed to increase engine power or boost fuel economy, but that these modifications increase vehicle emissions and thus violate the Clean Air Act,"" the Library of Congress said in its final rule.However, the new rules do not allow vehicle owners to break any other laws, the Library said, and will not take effect for a year so the EPA and other agencies have time to prepare.

The company reports its fiscal fourth quarter on November 25.The deal includes Monosem's four facilities in France and two U.S. facilities in Edwardsville, Kansas and Ithaca, Michigan. Deere said Monosem will retain its own brand and trademark.

82,"  (Releads, writes through with analyst, farmer comment)By P.J. Huffstutter and Meredith DavisCHICAGO Nov 3 Monsanto Co's Climate Corp will sell its Precision Planting farm equipment business to Deere & Co for an undisclosed sum, a move that underscores how turmoil in the agriculture sector has made it ripe for consolidation.For Climate, a unit of the world's largest seed company, the deal marks the latest push to shed businesses that are not focused on either software or services, Climate President Mike Stern said.Deere, the world's largest farm equipment maker, hopes the deal will create a revenue stream in retrofitting older machinery to help offset slumping sales elsewhere.With a glut of used farm equipment on the market and most farmers not interested in buying new machinery due to soft commodity prices, both companies are hoping the deal will tempt farmers to update equipment and buy into new farm-data services.Grain prices are hovering around five-year lows and farm income is expected to tumble 21 percent this year, keeping a lid on spending by farmers and putting pressure on companies across the sector to consolidate and seek cost savings.Tuesday's deal is Deere's second push into the precision-planting equipment arena this week. On Monday, it announced plans to acquire France-based Monosem. Monosem makes farm equipment known as ""precision planters, that use a technologically advanced process in which farmers can specify seed planting depths by crop row.Last month, Deere entered a joint venture with DN2K to create a software platform for agricultural advisers and consultants. One key for Climate in the deal is size: Deere controls about 60 percent of the U.S. farm equipment market, according to industry analysts.Climate said it will have a multi-year, exclusive agreement to move near real-time data between certain John Deere farm equipment and Climate's farming software programs, Climate FieldView.Deere will take most of Precision Planting's equipment business - which is built on a series of mechanical products that attach to planters and other farm machinery. In addition, the deal also gives Deere all of the company's hardware, sensors and display systems.Deere will also acquire the Precision Planting brand and facilities and most of its product portfolio, spokesman Ken Golden told Reuters. Deere plans to run Precision Planting as an independent, wholly owned subsidiary. Deere officials said the deal is expected to close within 90 days, pending regulatory approval.CUTTING COSTS The deal also is part of a strategic shift for Monsanto, which made its first major move into high-tech farming when it bought Precision Planting for $250 million in 2012. The seed giant is restructuring its operations to cut costs in a slumping commodity market, company officials and industry analysts say.The American Farm Bureau Federation, the country's largest farmer group, is monitoring industry moves toward consolidation and will raise any concerns with regulators if its members are impacted, its chief economist Bob Young told Reuters on Tuesday.""We're going into a phase where there will be a fair amount of consolidation at all levels: input suppliers, equipment makers,"" Young said. ""It won't surprise me to see some of that go on within (equipment) dealerships as well. You may not like it, but I don't know what you do to keep it from happening at this stage.""For central Illinois farmer Steve Moffitt, having different computer systems inside his tractor seamlessly working together would be a relief.""That is a big issue for us, to share data from one cloud to another becomes tough sometimes,"" he said on a conference call with Climate executives on Tuesday.But other farmers feared the deal would slow future innovations.""Precision Planting was a very innovative company,"" said Steve Pitstick, who farms about 2,600 acres of corn and soybeans in Illinois. ""When they were privately held, they were bringing us two or three new things a year that were great.""When Monsanto bought them, it was one or two new things a year, and nothing that wowed. Now, I don't know what to expect.""     (Reporting By P.J. Huffstutter and Meredith Davis in Chicago.

84,"   By Meredith Davis  Deere & Co (DE.N) on Wednesday reported a drop in quarterly earnings that was not as steep as Wall Street expected and gave a less dire outlook than analysts had feared, saying it was well-positioned to weather a worsening slump in demand for its farm equipment.Shares of the maker of John Deere tractors were up 4 percent at $79.40 in afternoon trading. Chief Financial Officer Raj Kalathur told analysts on a conference call that while the company forecasts its third straight year of declines in sales of agricultural equipment, its main business, in fiscal 2016, it also expects to remain “solidly profitable.”""We are forecasting a very healthy level of cash flow of over $2.5 billion in 2016,"" Kalathur said. ""Our actions and proactively controlling expenses, costs, and managing assets have enabled us to deliver substantially better results than in any of the past downturns."" Deere expects total equipment sales to drop about 11 percent in its first quarter, which began on Nov. 1, and fall about 7 percent for the year.  Deere also forecast net income attributable to the company at about $1.4 billion for fiscal 2016, down from $1.94 billion in 2015. Analysts on average were expecting about $1.31 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. While Deere has managed to beat analysts' expectations, market fundamentals largely remain weak. The company relies on the United States and Canada for the bulk of its sales and revenue. But industry sales of high-powered two-wheeled drive tractors in those countries fell 34 percent in October, the Association of Equipment Manufacturers said.  The U.S. Department of Agriculture expects U.S. net farm income to show a 38 percent drop to $55.9 billion in 2015. In Europe, the agriculture market is also under pressure due to lower farm income. And in South America, Brazil has gone further into a recession. Deere also faces a glut of used equipment, which could force it to slow production or cut jobs, said Argus Research analyst Bill Selesky. Used equipment, especially large tractors in the United States and Canada, remain a challenge, Tony Huegel, Deere director of investor relations, said on the call, but moving them out of inventory stocks will be a focus in 2016.

96,"  (Corrects details of Deere & Co history in 24th and 25th paragraphs)By Karen Brettell and Timothy AeppelWATERLOO, Iowa Dec 23 Matt Happel and Pam Egli are first cousins, part of a sprawling family so big it rents a church hall for Christmas parties.They grew up close. Egli often babysat Happel and later loved going to his football games. He's a natural athlete, she says, noting that he was quarterback all four years of high school.The cousins have another connection that has nothing to do with their stolid Midwestern roots -- one that runs straight through Wall Street.Happel, now a 40-year-old divorced father of three, was laid off in April from Deere & Co.'s transmission factory in Waterloo, where he earned $21 an hour on the assembly line.The Moline, Illinois-based tractor maker, hit hard by a slumping farm economy, has shed hundreds of workers as sales and profit have fallen. As conditions worsen, Deere has been raising record amounts of debt, helping to finance loans to buyers of its farm equipment, while also spending billions of dollars on share buybacks.Egli, 16 years older, retired two years ago from teaching elementary school. The state pension fund that sends her a monthly check is among the many such funds that have gobbled up Deere's debt, as well as riskier investments, chasing the higher returns they need to keep paying retirees.The Iowa cousins' Wall Street connection is a single, small strand in a vast web of massive financial flows, woven in the easy-money environment the U.S. Federal Reserve has maintained for years.It begins with pension funds like the one Egli relies on. These big institutional investors are in a bind. To keep sending checks to rising numbers of retiring baby boomers, they are chasing higher returns than they can get from traditional fixed-income investments like U.S. Treasury securities. At the same time, they are wary of relying heavily on stocks after the market rout during the financial crisis bit deep into their reserves.So they are turning to fixed-income investments. More than buying bonds directly, they are investing in private equity and hedge funds, which use borrowed money to increase returns on debt while also chasing higher-risk, higher-return investments such as junk bonds. Egli's retirement fund, the Iowa Public Employees' Retirement System, or IPERS, is among the many pension funds that have emerged as major investors in these alternative investments.The demand from pension funds is helping to finance record levels of corporate debt. The low interest rates that have crimped returns on investments also make it dirt cheap for companies to borrow, and many of them are doing just that, often to buy back their own shares.FUEL FOR THE STOCK MARKET As reported in earlier installments in this series, corporate America is pouring unprecedented amounts into buybacks. Using debt to finance buybacks can produce tax or accounting benefits. The buybacks provide an alternative to capital investment or research spending when business conditions don't justify making long-term bets. Instead, buybacks return profits to shareholders - and often enhance executive pay  - even when a company hits lean times and is laying off workers.In fact, buybacks have become the fuel powering the more-than twofold increase in the stock market since the depths of the financial crisis in 2009. Together, U.S. non-financial companies have spent $2.24 trillion on buybacks since 2009, while borrowing an extra $1.9 trillion to help finance those purchases, according to a Reuters review of Federal Reserve data.During the same period, mutual and exchange traded funds have bought less stock, at $1.24 trillion. Pension funds, meanwhile, have been net sellers to the tune of $1.05 trillion since 2009, while households and hedge funds have dumped an additional $558 billion.""We are in a massive bull market that is being generated by credit-led financial engineering,"" said Brian Reynolds, chief market strategist at brokerage firm New Albion Partners, who analyzes pension fund allocations for signals of stock market values.Since 2008, Deere's total debt has risen by $2.72 billion to $4.93 billion - and those figures don't include regular bond issues by the compangy's financing arm to help underwrite customer purchases. During the same period, Deere has repurchased $12.33 billion of its shares.Deere said that money for the buybacks came from strong cash flow, not borrowing, and that the company gives priority to spending on research and development over buybacks. The company increased debt in fiscal 2012 as a protective measure, Chief Financial Officer Rajesh Kalathur said, in case the impasse in Washington over raising the nation's debt ceiling roiled markets. After that threat faded, he said, it would have been ""unreasonable"" to hold excess cash.Many other companies have been borrowing heavily to help pay for buybacks.St. Louis, Missouri-based agrochemical giant Monsanto Co, for example, is caught in the same commodities downturn as Deere. It said in October that it would slash 2,600 jobs as commodity prices slump. But it has increased debt by $7 billion since 2013, helping to fund $8 billion in share buybacks in the same time frame.San Diego-based chip maker Qualcomm Inc said in July that it would cut 4,500 full-time staff, or 15 percent of its workforce, as foreign competition pinches sales. The company raised $11 billion in debt this year, helping to finance $11.25 billion in buybacks for the year.And Atlanta-based beverage maker Coca-Cola Co said in January that it would cut at least 1,600 white-collar jobs as it faced sluggish soda sales. It has added $9 billion in debt since the end of 2013 and bought back $6.13 billion of its shares in that time.""Basically what you're seeing in the stock market is a slow-motion leveraged buyout of the entire market,"" said Ed Yardeni, founder of Yardeni Research. GLOBAL HEADWINDS Deere for a decade was riding high on a global surge in commodities. Farmers from India to Iowa eagerly snapped up Deere's machines - many of which can sell for $250,000 or more - as they rushed to meet the world's growing demand for corn and soybeans. The company also makes construction and forestry equipment.But that boom has gone bust as growth in China and other emerging economies cooled over the past several years. Deere said in January that it would cut more than 900 workers in Iowa and Illinois, including 565 in Waterloo, as it rushes to curb output. The layoffs came on top of 1,100 job cuts last year.In Waterloo, the layoffs hit like a tornado. Deere operates four factories in this city of 68,000 people and is by far the largest private employer around. The company's roots here reach back to the early part of the last century, when the company started by an Illinois blacksmith named John Deere, who had invented a plow that worked well in the Midwest's dense soil, decided to diversify into a new device called a ""tractor.""Rather than develop its own machine, Deere bought the company that made the Waterloo Boy tractor, establishing this city's role as a production hub. Before the farm crisis of the 1980s, Deere employed 16,000 in Waterloo. Those numbers were down to about 4,000 before the most recent wave of cuts.""We're about as close as America still has to a one-company town,"" said Dave Nagle, a local attorney who represented the area in Congress as a Democrat in the late 1980s and early 1990s.Deere has outsourced much of the work once done in its Waterloo plants, he noted, including to some smaller operations in the area that pay much lower wages. ""So the wage bracket of the whole community has taken a significant hit,"" he said. ""We really never came back from the farm crisis.""Deere's Waterloo workers are unionized - and proud of their American roots. A sign outside the United Autoworkers local union hall warns visitors to park foreign-built cars out of sight at the back of the lot.Union president Tom Ralston said Deere offered laid-off workers generous support - as well as the opportunity to get retrained or go back to college for up to two years through a federal grant that covers all costs, including commuting in some cases. ""But at the end of the day,"" he said, ""it's hard to be laid off and out of work.""Happel agrees. He came to Deere after he got laid off from a local printing company during the depths of the last recession. Deere was one of the few places hiring at the time, and he thought he landed well. He figured he might eventually retire from there, like many of members of his extended family.But the stress of that previous layoff still haunts him. He was having troubles in his marriage at the time, he said, and the ""financial pressures of that definitely added to them."" The couple divorced in 2010. He initially ruled out going back to school after Deere cut him, he said, because he knew it would mean at least two years of financial hardship - and he worried what that would do to his current relationship (he's now engaged to be married) and his children.His fiancée's daughter lives with them, and his own three teenagers split their time between his home and their mother's. All he could see were mounting bills. His oldest daughter heads to college in the fall, he said, and they have no savings set aside for that.""We're meeting with a financial adviser this week on that,"" he said, after settling into a booth at a diner across the street from the University of Northern Iowa's starkly modern campus, just a few miles up the road from Deere's transmission plant.CAREER CHANGE Happel is now studying at the University of Northern Iowa to become an actuary - someone who helps insurance companies and others measure and manage risk and uncertainty.He still worries. His fiancée is an information technology specialist for an insurance company. A few days earlier, he said, she was called in for a meeting where the company announced cutbacks. Her job is safe, he said, ""but it's a scary thing.""He paused for a moment, and then asked: ""We're not supposed to be in a recession now, are we?""Many laid off Deere workers end up across town, at the Displaced Worker Transition Center - a glass-walled building on the edge of Waterloo's community college campus - where counselors help Deere workers pilot their retraining or college options.Longtime Deere workers said it can be hard to jump into other factory jobs. Other local employers know that the workers - who can be recalled to their old jobs for a period equal to however long they worked there - are unlikely to stick with lower-paying jobs if Deere beckons them back. For that reason, some employers refuse to even consider Deere workers for job openings.Robbie Hadaway, who was laid off in April, now works as a counselor at the displaced worker center. ""I just think they could have impacted fewer people's lives - if they'd done a better job of projecting sales,"" he said.Deere said the last six years have seen the most rapid fluctuation in demand for its products in the company's history. ""Recently, there have been layoffs as Deere balances the size of its manufacturing workforce with market demand for products,"" said Ken Golden, a Deere spokesman. ""Even so, Deere employs several thousand more people today than in 2009."" When local employers slash jobs, the hardships of people like Happel and Hadaway reverberate through the entire community.Michelle Weidner, Waterloo's chief financial officer, said the town never fully recovered from the massive 1980s downturn in the U.S. farm economy. The town gets most of its income from property taxes, which tank when there are big layoffs and a sudden rush of people trying to sell houses at the same time. The latest cuts at Deere have yet to hit their budget, she said, ""but we know it is coming.""The town has shed a few fire and police personnel as it absorbs the impact of new tax rules mandated by the state, which limit how much they can collect on property taxes from businesses. The library has maintained hours, Weidner said, but it's ""become a very heated budget conversation every year."" The library now gets by with the help of donations and bequests to help preserve services.The town contributes to teacher pensions, as well as those for about half of the town's employees through the Iowa Public Employees' Retirement System, or IPERS, which manages retirement funds for public employees throughout the state.IPERS owns two bonds sold by Deere's financing arm in 2012, part of the $28 billion fund's allocation to lower-risk fixed income investments. The fund also invests 11 percent of its portfolio in private equity and debt, and 5 percent in higher-yield, high-risk credit such as junk bonds.It has reduced the weighting of publicly traded stocks to 41 percent from 48 percent in 2005.PENSION FUNDS PINCHED That pattern has been repeated at many pension funds. A study this year by consultants Towers Watson found that pensions accounted for 33 percent, or $1.14 trillion, of total assets of the world's 100 largest alternative asset managers.""Pension funds are the single most important investor base,"" said Oliver Wriedt, co-president of CIFC Asset Management, which has $14.2 billion under management and specializes in corporate loans.Cities and states across the country have been cutting jobs and services as they devote more money to pension plans. Illinois, which is more than $100 billion behind on its obligations, is in the worst shape with a funding ratio of assets to liabilities of only 39 percent. It is followed by Kentucky, Connecticut and Alaska.Mr. Reynolds, the market strategist at New Albion Partners, said: ""There is a cash call on cities and towns. Instead of hiring cops or teachers, more money gets diverted to the pensions from the city.""The hunt for higher returns can make a pension fund more vulnerable to losses if markets seize up. Their recent emphasis on leveraged investments - those made with borrowed money to boost potential returns -- can create contagion across markets because fund managers often need to sell assets to meet margin and redemption calls.Illiquid debt can also pose dangers when fund managers face a wave of redemptions. Just this month, a Third Avenue Management LLC fund that invested in risky and illiquid loans collapsed, leading to losses across the junk bond market as investors fretted over whether the damage would spread.Based on similar concerns, some pensions have switched out of higher-risk strategies. That's what the San Diego County pension fund did this year, only a year after boosting leverage and investing in less liquid assets. ""We've gone from a levered position to an unlevered position,"" said Stephen Sexauer, chief investment officer at the fund, who was hired in May to reallocate the pension's resources.Egli said she is not worried about the durability of IPERS. She taught and still lives in Waverly, Iowa, about 21 miles north of Waterloo, and she said her town weathered both the recession and a natural disaster that made life tough for everyone. In 2008, a flood inundated the area - damaging 700 homes and 100 businesses.Wage increases were meager to nonexistent for nearly five years, said the 56-year-old, and teachers had to pay more for their insurance. There were also changes to the retirement plan that meant slightly smaller checks for retirees like her. One change: The pension switched from calculating retirement pay based on the average of her three highest-earning years to the five highest, which nudged down the number.""But my sense is that IPERS has done a really good job,"" she said. ""They took a little bit more from us to be sure they could cover it.""She's right. The IPERS pension is 84 percent funded - up from a low of 80 percent in 2011, though it remains below the 89 percent level it was at a decade ago.Egli is secure. Her husband, a self-employed attorney, is still working and she now substitute teaches about half of the school days each month.Her cousin is having a tough time making ends meet. Happel will collect unemployment insurance as long as he is enrolled in classes, but the $400 a week he receives is only a fraction of what he earned at Deere. The family has cut out extras: no movies, no dinners out. He dipped into his 401(k) retirement savings account to pay off credit cards, but notes ruefully that those card balances are now drifting back up as he scrambles to cover expenses.Being part of a big family eases the strain. His family still owns the 1,200-acre farm that was homesteaded by his great-grandfather and is now operated by his father and brother. ""I go over there when they need a hand,"" he said. ""That extra money helps, but it doesn't get us caught up by any means.(Edited by John Blanton)",2015-12-23,DE,"Wed Dec 23, 2015 | 12:03pm EST","CORRECTED-SPECIAL REPORT-Money-go-round fuels buybacks, leaves workers sidelined",http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-buybacks-workers-idUSL1N14B0TA20151223?type=companyNews
97,"  (Recasts; adds analyst quote, byline)By Karl PlumeCHICAGO Jan 7 Slumping commodities prices and weak demand in some markets took their toll on profits for global commodities trader Cargill Inc in the quarter ending Nov. 30, sending earnings and revenue down 13 percent and 10 percent, respectively.Privately held Cargill, celebrating its 150th birthday this year, is in the midst of a restructuring aimed at transforming the company to be more responsive to commodities market swings.In the latest of a growing list of weak earnings by agriculture-focused companies, Cargill's lower results reported on Thursday suggest agribusiness rivals such as Archer Daniels Midland Co and Bunge Ltd are feeling similar pain, analysts said. Both rivals report quarterly results early next month.""Given the low crop prices, farmers are resistant to sell right away after the harvest. There are also some other issues around the devaluation in Argentina and obviously things are slow in Brazil,"" said Moody's analyst John Rogers. ""It's going to be a tough quarter for everyone.""Minnesota-based Cargill reported lower year-on-year results in each of its four of its business segments.Weak cattle feeding margins in North America and a thinned Australian cattle herd weighed down earnings from red meat, while the slumping Brazilian and Argentine economies dragged down profits for food staples in South America. A milder-than-normal start to the winter in North America curbed earnings from products such as road salt and pressured prices of natural gas and power, which hurt energy trading results.Earnings were further weighed down by losses stemming from liquidation of hedge funds managed by its Black River Asset Management subsidiary. Cargill is splitting the unit into three separate firms. Cargill's profit fell to $574 million from $657 million a year earlier while revenue declined to $27.3 billion.The results excluded gains from the sale of its U.S. pork business in October for $1.45 billion and the $720 million sale of its 50 percent stake in a U.S. steel mill venture as part of a broader restructuring plan.Cargill launched a restructuring last year that could lead to cuts of as many as 4,000 jobs and closures of some offices.  The company has also streamlined its management structure.The moves come as companies across the agricultural economy tighten belts amid a steep commodities market downturn.Farm equipment makers such as Deere & Co have reported declines in sales of tractors and combines. Seed and chemicals company Monsanto Co said on Wednesday that the weakening farm sector would weigh on earnings in 2016 and lead to more job cuts at the company.

98,"   By Meredith Davis  Deere & Co (DE.N) cut its fiscal-year sales and profit outlook and reported lower quarterly earnings on Friday as farmers' declining income weakened demand for agricultural equipment, and its shares fell more than 4 percent.The maker of John Deere tractors said it now expected farming and construction equipment sales to fall 10 percent in the year ending in October, compared with an earlier forecast of a 7 percent decline. It lowered its earnings outlook to $1.3 billion from $1.4 billion.On a conference call following the results, the company said its new contract with the United Auto Workers increased the option for factory downtime to 16 weeks from 10. The increase gives the company additional factory flexibility as demand for new equipment wanes during the U.S. farm economy's third year of decline.   Sales of Deere's agricultural equipment, the company's larger segment, have fallen as lower prices for commodities such as corn and soybeans have slashed farmers' income.The company said it expected North American sales of agricultural equipment to decline 15 percent to 20 percent industrywide in 2016.Farm income has also fallen in Europe, while Brazil, the world's top exporter of soybeans, has slid further into a recession. Equipment sales fell 23 percent in the construction and forestry segment. Deere attributed the decline to lower shipment volumes and unfavorable currency exchange rates.  For the current quarter, Deere expects total equipment sales to fall 8 percent from a year earlier.""A key issue will be Deere's ability to maintain good cost control with revenue declines in both its business units,"" Jefferies analyst Stephen Volkmann said in a note. Shares of Deere were down 4.3 percent at $76.91 in afternoon trading. Net income attributable to Deere fell 34 percent to $254.4 million, or 80 cents per share, in the first quarter ended on Jan. 31 from $387 million, or $1.12 per share, a year earlier.Analysts on average expected a profit of 70 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. At the John Deere Capital Corp financial unit, net income fell to $99.9 million from $133.6 million. Deere attributed the drop to declines in leased equipment value, unfavorable financing spreads and higher provision for credit losses.The used farm and construction equipment market has grown in recent years. In particular, there were large volumes of agricultural equipment trade-ins three or four years ago, when farm income was significantly higher.

102,"   By P.J. Huffstutter and Justin Madden | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Steve Irish used to farm 450 acres of rich crop fields in east-central Illinois, but that 15-year chapter of his life ended  with a recent conversation with his banker.The banker was blunt. Irish was deep in debt from the farm equipment he bought, and needed to pay back the money he owed. So now Irish's tractor, combine and other machinery needed to run a grain farm is up for sale in an online auction.""We had no choice,"" said Irish, who also lost the lease on most of his rented 450 acres. Without land and equipment, he said, he could not farm.As the U.S. farming sector enters the third year of a downturn caused by a global glut of grains and slumping commodity prices, bankers across the Midwest are starting to tighten lending conditions and even cutting some clients off.Many corn and soybean farmers already are trying to adjust by selling off grain stockpiles, begging landlords to reduce rents and pleading with bankers to restructure debt and give them more time to pay it back.But bankers are worried about the potential of loan defaults as incomes fall, prompting farmers to take on more debt. U.S. farm debt, adjusted for inflation, is now at the highest levels since the nation's agricultural crisis in the 1980s, when scores of rural banks failed.Tightening credit sends a clear message: the hard times are here to stay, and sacrifices are in order to avoid a future of forced land sales, farm equipment repossession and bankruptcies. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/1PXN70N)In that vein, banker Jim Knuth had some brusque advice for those attending a major farmland investment event in West Des Moines, Iowa, last month.Those vacation homes? Spare tractors? Sell them. Landowners will not lower the rents? If you can't make a profit off the ground, stop farming it.""You need to accept this new normal,"" Knuth, senior vice president of Farm Credit Services of America, the largest production agriculture lender in the upper Midwest, told more than 300 farmers and landowners. ""Cash is king."" CREDIT SQUEEZE How many farmers have had their credit lines cut off in recent months is not known. At least for now, say bankers, they do not expect a repeat of the 1980s, when Willie Nelson and Neil Young held a benefit concert to help thousands of bankrupt farmers. Current interest rates are far lower, as are debt-to-equity ratios. Farm assets, too, are valued at about one-third higher, according to federal data.But bankers now are saying no to clients they may have backed during the recent boom times, according to farmers, economists and interviews with nearly three dozen lenders.Some are requiring customers to put more cash down for land or equipment purchases; others have suggested farmers update their resumes. Customers with grain in their bins are being steered toward government-backed loans where the taxpayer would shoulder some of the risk. The number of these marketing assistance loans from the U.S. Department of Agriculture - short-term credit backed by crops - rose to over 47,500 with $5.7 billion dispersed in 2015, up over 50 percent from when the downturn began in 2013, according to USDA data.""It's cheap money at a favorable interest rate,"" said Bob Allen, a vice president at Iowa-based Home State Bank, who recommended such loans.BILLS DUE The squeeze comes as most farmland rent payments – which can run into millions of dollars – are due March 1. Seasonal payment deadlines also loom for seeds, chemicals and equipment. The crunch could also deepen the pain felt by input suppliers, grain buyers and equipment manufacturers. On Friday, Deere & Co further cut its sales and profit outlook and said it now expected farming and construction equipment sales to fall 10 percent for the year ending in October.Other signs of financial stress are also mounting.Farm sector debt soared past $364 billion last year and is forecast at over $372 billion in 2016, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) - levels not seen since 1984. The USDA also predicts net farm incomes will fall for a third year in a row to $54.8 billion, down 56 percent from 2013's peak. Demand for loans has been rising for 11 consecutive quarters but repayment rates are falling. A survey by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago showed repayment rates at the end of 2015 at their lowest since early 1999.The volume of the farm loan portfolio with ""major"" or ""severe"" repayment problems was 5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2015, up from 2.9 percent a year earlier.Funds available for non-real estate agricultural loans shrank for two consecutive quarters in the second half of 2015, according to data from the Federal Reserve Banks of Kansas City and Chicago.And the value of U.S. cropland - often used as collateral - is starting to slide. Land prices dropped as much as 10 percent in parts of Iowa, the top U.S. corn producer, in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, the Chicago Fed says.""There's only so much patience out there,"" said Eric Hardmeyer, president of the Bank of North Dakota. ""It's not the banker's fault and it's not the suppliers' fault that commodity prices are what they are. They all need to get paid."" (Reporting By P.J.

Caterpillar had initially planned to move truck production from Mexico to a plant in Victoria, Texas, but it has now decided to end the on-highway truck venture, company executive Ramin Younessi said in a statement.   Caterpillar last year outlined a wide-ranging restructuring that could cut 10,000 employees by 2018 and shut factories around the globe. Eariler this week it announced an additional consolidation of operating divisions. Caterpillar has 105,700 employees worldwide, down 8 percent from 2014. (Reporting by Meredith Davis.

It will continue to make sprayers under the Hagie brand but with no dealerships, the company will have access to Deere's global customers.""It is notable that Hagie basically put itself on sale, because they had a financial advisor involved,"" said Jim Corridore, analyst at S&P Global Market Intelligence.NCP, Inc, a Des Moines, Iowa investment bank was the exclusive financial advisor to Hagie.

""The fact that they were looking to get an investor involved, they probably needed the funds given how bad the sector has been and for how long it has been bad,"" Corridore said.  The joint venture is another sign of consolidation in the agriculture sector as the U.S. farm economy enters its third-straight down year.   Deere and other agriculture equipment manufacturers have continued to invest millions in acquisitions, research and development even as demand for farm equipment and machinery tapers off in the wake of the weakest U.S. farm economy in 30 years.In November, Deere said it would purchase Monsanto Co's (MON.N) Precision Planting farm equipment business and run it as a independent subsidiary. The farm machinery market has moved more toward ""precision agriculture,"" a process that allows farmers to measure and manage precise amounts of inputs, such as seed, fertilizer and pesticide, in an effort to keep costs low.  The agreement between Hagie and Deere allows Deere to add precision technology to Hagie sprayers.   Hagie's sales and service will be integrated into Deere's global distribution channel over the next 15 months, a Deere statement said.

Deere's sales have also suffered in Brazil, the world's largest exporter of soybeans, during a recession and political turmoil.In the smaller construction and forestry segment, sales of new machines have fallen because of abundant supplies of used equipment.Also, profitability at the John Deere Capital Corp financial services arm has been hurt by declines in the value of leased equipment, unfavorable financing spreads and higher provisions for credit losses.    Deere reduced its fiscal-year net income forecast to $1.2 billion.

J.P Morgan analyst Ann Duignan said on Friday that Deere, along with other agriculture, construction and mining equipment companies, could face higher costs due to increased cold rolled steel prices, which were up 64 percent year to date.

122,"  As Justin Rose was basking in the glory of becoming the first Olympic champion in 112 years, Ryan Moore collected $864,000 more than the Briton for winning the John Deere Classic on the PGA Tour on Sunday.Moore claimed his fifth tour title by two strokes over fellow American Ben Martin in a low-key affair in Silvis, Illinois, where he received polite applause from the gallery after tapping in from two feet at the last.About three hours earlier, Rose had displayed unrestrained ecstasy after sinking his winning putt for golf's first Olympic gold since 1904 after a final-round battle with British Open champion Henrik Stenson of Sweden.While the spotlight shone on Rio, Moore triumphed over an underwhelming field in Illinois.Jordan Spieth, last year's John Deere Classic champion, did not defend his title, deeming it inappropriate after he pulled out of the Olympics due to 'health issues'. Fellow American Dustin Johnson, who also made himself unavailable for Rio, also skipped the John Deere, which is usually played in July but was moved this year to play opposite  the Olympics.Moore added to his PGA Tour resume in business-like fashion with a bogey-free four-under-par 67 at the TPC Deere Run that gave him a 22-under-par 262 total. The former U.S. amateur champion started the day with a one-shot edge, which he extended to five before Martin created a bit of excitement with three consecutive birdies from the 12th to close the margin to a couple of strokes.However, that was where the gap remained, as both players parred the final four holes. ""On this course you can rattle off a few birdies in a row real fast,"" Moore, who played the final 46 holes without a bogey, said in a television interview.""I was trying to make birdies coming down the stretch. I was trying to stretch that margin out a little bit but I couldn’t get any putts to go and in the end snuck it out.""

124,"   By Meredith Davis  Deere & Co (DE.N) shares soared more than 12 percent on Friday after the world's largest farm equipment manufacturer raised its fiscal year profit outlook and said it is redoubling cost-cutting efforts to offset slumping sales of farm and construction machinery.Shares of Deere were up 12.8 percent at $86.75 in late afternoon trading after the company reported better-than-expected second-quarter results. Deere officials said they are relying on cost cutting, not a rebound in demand, to deliver fiscal-year earnings of $1.35 billion, up from the previous forecast of $1.2 billion.  ""We have devoted more of our R&D resources to focus on cost reductions in the last two years,"" Chief Financial Officer Raj Kalathur said during a conference call with analysts. ""We have increased our focus on efficiency improvement and structural cost-reduction activities."" Deere has put about 2,000 employees in its Midwestern factories on indefinite layoff since 2014, spokesman Ken Golden said. Deere's global workforce is now about 57,000 employees, down from about 67,000 in 2013. The company said production hours at its East Moline, Illinois, combine factory will decline 60 percent this quarter. The company also plans to reduce output at its Waterloo, Iowa, tractor plant by 20 percent. Other heavy machinery manufacturers are accelerating job cuts and shedding operations to weather a prolonged demand slump. Caterpillar Inc. (CAT.N), the world's largest manufacturer of mining and construction equipment, said Thursday it is exploring options, including divesting, for some of its operations that make coal mining equipment.Earlier this month Duluth, Georgia-based AGCO Corp (AGCO.N), a global agriculture manufacturer, said cost reductions helped to offset decreased volume of sales.  Farm and industrial equipment maker CNH Industrial (CNHI.MI) (CNHI.N) last month reported an increase in second quarter operating profit in its agricultural equipment segment which it partially credited to cost reductions.The U.S. farm economy is in its third down year, with the U.S. Department of Agriculture forecasting a 3 percent drop in nationwide income to $54.8 billion in 2016. Costs of seeds and chemicals remain high, while record-large harvests are pressuring crop prices.Deere said it expected an equipment sales decline of 10 percent for the fiscal year, steeper than the 9 percent drop it had forecast in May.

125,"   By Meredith Davis  Deere & Co (DE.N) shares soared more than 12 percent on Friday after the world's largest farm equipment manufacturer raised its fiscal year profit outlook and said it is redoubling cost-cutting efforts to offset slumping sales of farm and construction machinery.Shares of Deere were up 12.8 percent at $86.75 in late afternoon trading after the company reported better-than-expected second-quarter results. Deere officials said they are relying on cost cutting, not a rebound in demand, to deliver fiscal-year earnings of $1.35 billion, up from the previous forecast of $1.2 billion.  ""We have devoted more of our R&D resources to focus on cost reductions in the last two years,"" Chief Financial Officer Raj Kalathur said during a conference call with analysts. ""We have increased our focus on efficiency improvement and structural cost-reduction activities."" Deere has put about 2,000 employees in its Midwestern factories on indefinite layoff since 2014, spokesman Ken Golden said. Deere's global workforce is now about 57,000 employees, down from about 67,000 in 2013. The company said production hours at its East Moline, Illinois, combine factory will decline 60 percent this quarter. The company also plans to reduce output at its Waterloo, Iowa, tractor plant by 20 percent. Other heavy machinery manufacturers are accelerating job cuts and shedding operations to weather a prolonged demand slump. Caterpillar Inc. (CAT.N), the world's largest manufacturer of mining and construction equipment, said Thursday it is exploring options, including divesting, for some of its operations that make coal mining equipment.Earlier this month Duluth, Georgia-based AGCO Corp (AGCO.N), a global agriculture manufacturer, said cost reductions helped to offset decreased volume of sales.  Farm and industrial equipment maker CNH Industrial (CNHI.MI) (CNHI.N) last month reported an increase in second quarter operating profit in its agricultural equipment segment which it partially credited to cost reductions.The U.S. farm economy is in its third down year, with the U.S. Department of Agriculture forecasting a 3 percent drop in nationwide income to $54.8 billion in 2016. Costs of seeds and chemicals remain high, while record-large harvests are pressuring crop prices.Deere said it expected an equipment sales decline of 10 percent for the fiscal year, steeper than the 9 percent drop it had forecast in May.   ""Revenues were worse than we expected, but Deere (is) doing a great job cutting costs,"" S&P Global Market Intelligence analyst Jim Corridore said in a statement.

129,"   By Diane Bartz and Meredith Davis | WASHINGTON/CHICAGO  WASHINGTON/CHICAGO The U.S. Justice Department filed a lawsuit on Wednesday aimed at stopping Deere & Co  from buying Monsanto Co's Precision Planting farm equipment business.Deere said in a statement that it would fight the lawsuit, saying that the Justice Department's antitrust concerns were ""misguided.""Monsanto had said in November that it would sell to Deere its Precision Planting unit, which makes the components of precision planters. Precision Planting also sells its technology to retrofit older planters and to other planter manufacturers. Deere has its own precision planting technology.The Justice Department said the proposed deal would mean higher prices for farmers who want to buy equipment for high-speed precision planting, which allows farmers to plant row crops like corn up to twice as fast as with conventional machinery. In February, Deere completed its acquisition of Monosem, which also makes precision planters.A massive Deere ExactEmerge planter sells for about $150,000, which includes components for precision farming, while a Precision Planting retrofit kit costs about $30,000, J.P. Morgan analyst Ann Duignan estimated in a research note. In particular, the Justice Department was concerned about Deere selling both the big machine planters themselves as well as the technology to make the big machines.""By offering farmers high-speed precision planting retrofit kits at a fraction of the cost of a new planter, Precision Planting posed a formidable challenge to Deere and its profitable sales of new planters,"" the Justice Department said in its complaint, asking a court to stop the proposed transaction. Deere and Monsanto shares were each down about 1 percent in afternoon trading.""Precision Planting has been a key innovator in high-speed precision planting and Deere's only significant competitor in developing and selling these technologies,"" said Renata Hesse, the acting head of the Justice Department's Antitrust Division in a press release.The department estimated Deere and Precision Planting had at least 86 percent of the market. Its complaint put the transaction price at about $190 million. With a glut of used farm equipment, and many U.S. grain farmers cutting budgets amid stubbornly low commodity prices, both companies had been hoping the deal would tempt farmers to update equipment and buy new farm-data services.Farm net incomes have steadily fallen since hitting an all-time high of $123.8 billion in 2013, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Farm income is forecast to fall again this year to $71.5 billion, down nearly 12 percent from 2015, according to USDA data released this week.Deere's deal for Precision Planting is one of several pending or under discussion in the sector.

130,"   By Rod Nickel and Michael Hirtzer | WINNIPEG/CHICAGO  WINNIPEG/CHICAGO North American farmers will pressure regulators to protect their negotiating leverage with fertilizer suppliers if Potash Corp of Saskatchewan and Agrium Inc agree to merge, major farm groups said on Wednesday.The potential deal revealed on Tuesday would combine the world's largest fertilizer producer by capacity with the continent's biggest network of farm retail dealers and consolidate 60 percent of North America's potash production with one company.The tie-up would face regulatory scrutiny in both the United States and Canada. For farmers, already facing the prospect of fewer buying choices for seed and chemicals, the potential merger raises fears they will lose pricing power. Independent retailers in the United States and Canada worry about competing against a fertilizer Goliath that may stock its stores at preferential rates.""It's like the movie 'Mad Max' - one company owns everything,"" said Norm Hall, president of Agricultural Producers Association of Saskatchewan. ""There’s less and less competition out there. We’re being painted into a box because of corporate greed."" The group, based in Canada's largest crop-growing province, will raise concerns with the federal Competition Bureau if the merger proceeds, Hall said.Likewise, Manitoba's Keystone Agricultural Producers will ask the bureau to weigh the risk of higher farm costs, said president Dan Mazier.The Competition Bureau routinely contacts industry groups when it reviews proposed mergers, said spokeswoman Sophie Paluck-Bastien.The American Soybean Association, which represents 21,000 U.S. farmers, might complain to U.S. regulators if the merger advances. It opposes deals that limit competition and drive up prices, said spokesman Patrick Delaney, noting that the combined company would be ""dominant"" in North America. Potash Corp declined to comment and Agrium did not respond.FARM INCOMES SUFFERING Potash prices fell to decade lows this year, pressured by excess capacity and weak demand, but North American farm incomes have also suffered as corn and wheat prices tumbled to multi year lows. Proposed tie-ups between big seed companies Monsanto Co and Bayer AG, and ChemChina [CNNCC.UL] and Syngenta, have raised alarm among farmers, and the U.S. Justice Department is suing to stop Deere & Co from buying Monsanto's Precision Planting farm equipment business.  Fertilizer accounts for as much as one-third of input costs for U.S. corn farmers, according to the National Corn Growers Association.""The cost of farm inputs is a major concern to corn growers right now,"" said Cathryn Wojcicki, spokeswoman for the association. It will scrutinize the Potash-Agrium merger if it proceeds, she said.Agrium’s farm retail rivals, which include small cooperatives and independent dealers, are also wary.Regulators should ensure that the merged company supplies retailers under similar terms as before, said Randy Stephens, president of SureGrow Ag Products, which has three retail stores in Texas. ""They'll always be selling to (their own stores) at a discount to anyone else,"" Stephens said. Kevin Blair, chief executive of a family-owned chain of eight farm retail stores in Saskatchewan, said he would be shocked if the merger is approved in Canada.""Does it put us at a competitive disadvantage? Absolutely. But more important, it puts the grower at a disadvantage,"" Blair said.But Charles Neivert, analyst for Cowen Securities, said there is little reason to worry about competition.If the new company hikes fertilizer prices in the United States, lower-cost offshore producers would increase shipments, he said. Agrium's retail stores are already stocked mostly with its own fertilizer, leaving little room for additional supplies from Potash Corp, he added.Canadian Economic Development Minister Navdeep Bains told reporters that his government was ""definitely keeping an eye on"" the possible merger, but added that Ottawa wants Canadian companies to have global success.

Mike Stern, chief executive of Climate Corporation, told Reuters on Wednesday the sale would benefit farmers. Stern also said Climate and Deere are moving forward with plans to allow nearly real-time data connections between certain John Deere farm equipment and Climate's farming software programs, Climate FieldView.Monsanto's Climate acquisition, and the high price it paid for the San Francisco-based weather data analytics firm, ignited intense industry interest in agriculture technology businesses. Numerous competitors and non-farm investors jumped into the space, aimed at helping farmers grow bigger crops more efficiently using data analytics, drones and other high tech tools.But a steep downturn in farm incomes has cooled agrarian demand for the unproven technologies. It is also taking Monsanto longer to turn a profit: At the time of the Climate acquisition, officials told Reuters they expected it to boost Monsanto's earnings within two years.Monsanto's business model for Climate, too, has shifted since the acquisition and transformed the seed company to some degree, Fraley said.

139,"  (Repeats Aug. 31 story for wider distribution)By Rod Nickel and Michael HirtzerWINNIPEG/CHICAGO Aug 31 North American farmers will pressure regulators to protect their negotiating leverage with fertilizer suppliers if Potash Corp of Saskatchewan  and Agrium Inc agree to merge, major farm groups said on Wednesday.The potential deal revealed on Tuesday would combine the world's largest fertilizer producer by capacity with the continent's biggest network of farm retail dealers and consolidate 60 percent of North America's potash production with one company.The tie-up would face regulatory scrutiny in both the United States and Canada.For farmers, already facing the prospect of fewer buying choices for seed and chemicals, the potential merger raises fears they will lose pricing power. Independent retailers in the United States and Canada worry about competing against a fertilizer Goliath that may stock its stores at preferential rates.""It's like the movie 'Mad Max' - one company owns everything,"" said Norm Hall, president of Agricultural Producers Association of Saskatchewan. ""There's less and less competition out there. We're being painted into a box because of corporate greed.""The group, based in Canada's largest crop-growing province, will raise concerns with the federal Competition Bureau if the merger proceeds, Hall said.Likewise, Manitoba's Keystone Agricultural Producers will ask the bureau to weigh the risk of higher farm costs, said president Dan Mazier.The Competition Bureau routinely contacts industry groups when it reviews proposed mergers, said spokeswoman Sophie Paluck-Bastien. The American Soybean Association, which represents 21,000 U.S. farmers, might complain to U.S. regulators if the merger advances. It opposes deals that limit competition and drive up prices, said spokesman Patrick Delaney, noting that the combined company would be ""dominant"" in North America.Potash Corp declined to comment and Agrium did not respond.FARM INCOMES SUFFERING  Potash prices fell to decade lows this year, pressured by excess capacity and weak demand, but North American farm incomes have also suffered as corn and wheat prices tumbled to multiyear lows.Proposed tie-ups between big seed companies Monsanto Co  and Bayer AG, and ChemChina and Syngenta, have raised alarm among farmers, and the U.S. Justice Department is suing to stop Deere & Co from buying Monsanto's Precision Planting farm equipment business.Fertilizer accounts for as much as one-third of input costs for U.S. corn farmers, according to the National Corn Growers Association.""The cost of farm inputs is a major concern to corn growers right now,"" said Cathryn Wojcicki, spokeswoman for the association. It will scrutinize the Potash-Agrium merger if it proceeds, she said.Agrium's farm retail rivals, which include small cooperatives and independent dealers, are also wary. Regulators should ensure that the merged company supplies retailers under similar terms as before, said Randy Stephens, president of SureGrow Ag Products, which has three retail stores in Texas.""They'll always be selling to (their own stores) at a discount to anyone else,"" Stephens said.Kevin Blair, chief executive of a family-owned chain of eight farm retail stores in Saskatchewan, said he would be shocked if the merger is approved in Canada.""Does it put us at a competitive disadvantage? Absolutely. But more important, it puts the grower at a disadvantage,"" Blair said.But Charles Neivert, analyst for Cowen Securities, said there is little reason to worry about competition.If the new company hikes fertilizer prices in the United States, lower-cost offshore producers would increase shipments, he said. Agrium's retail stores are already stocked mostly with its own fertilizer, leaving little room for additional supplies from Potash Corp, he added.Canadian Economic Development Minister Navdeep Bains told reporters that his government was ""definitely keeping an eye on"" the possible merger, but added that Ottawa wants Canadian companies to have global success.(Additional reporting by Alastair Sharp and John Tilak in Toronto; Editing by Jeffrey Hodgson and Matthew Lewis)",2016-09-01,DE,"Thu Sep 1, 2016 | 6:05am EDT",RPT-Canada fertilizer deal would send farmers to regulators,http://www.reuters.com//article/agrium-ma-potashcorp-farmers-idUSL1N1BC2LP?type=companyNews

141,"   By Meredith Davis  Deere & Co (DE.N) said its proposal to buy Precision Planting, an agricultural equipment and technology company, will increase consumer choice and directly benefit growers, in a response filed on Wednesday to the U.S. Department of Justice's lawsuit to block the acquisition.Deere announced its planned acquisition of Precision Planting in November 2015, for about $190 million. Precision Planting's parent is The Climate Corporation, which is a unit of Monsanto Co (MON.N). In August, the Justice Department said the proposed deal would mean higher prices for high-speed precision planting equipment, which allows farmers to plant row crops, such as corn, up to twice as fast as with conventional machinery.In its response, Deere challenged the Justice Department's definition of ""high-speed precision planting system,"" saying it was vague and ambiguous. Deere also denied ""that there is any meaningful economic market consisting of 'high-speed precision planting systems.'"" The Justice Department declined to comment on Thursday.  Deere said the Justice Department initially cleared its proposed acquisition in October 2015 in compliance with the Federal Trade Commission’s Hart-Scott-Rodino Act. Clearance is separate from actual approval of a deal.Following a protest by an unnamed Deere competitor, the Justice Department opened a new investigation and later filed a lawsuit in August 2016 to block the transaction, Deere spokesman Ken Golden said, referring to legal documents the company filed on Wednesday.""It is our position that this case is designed to protect a competitor, not competition,"" Golden said. Both Deere and the Justice Department declined to name the competitor. CNH Industrial and AGCO Corp (AGCO.N) are Deere competitors that have agreements to factory install Precision Planting equipment on their new planters. Precision Planting equipment and technology can also be retrofit on older planters manufactured by Deere, Kinze Manufacturing, CNH Industrial and AGCO.Deere said the company's commitments to CNH Industrial and AGCO, and its license grants, technology transfers are all ""pro competitive.""   Additionally, Deere entered into an agreement with Ag Leader, an agricultural technology company, to manufacture and sell Precision Planting products if the acquisition is completed, as a possible remedy to the Justice Department's competition concerns.  Ag Leader will remain an independent competitor in the precision agriculture industry, a statement on the company's website said.Deere's proposed deal is part of a wave of consolidation among agriculture companies as they search for ways to cut costs and improve profits in the face of a shrinking farm economy.

144,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, October 28 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned 'A'/'F1' Long- and  Short-Term Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) to Deere & Company (Deere) and John  Deere Capital Corporation (JDCC). Fitch has also assigned debt ratings for Deere  and JDCC, including those of certain JDCC subsidiaries. The Rating Outlook is  Stable. Approximately $31 billion of Deere's consolidated debt is covered by the  ratings. Fitch's ratings and financial measures for Deere's equipment operations (Deere  Equipment) consider the company's Financial Services operations on an equity  basis. The ratings for JDCC incorporate support from Deere.  A full rating list appears at the end of this release.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - Deere Equipment The ratings for Deere incorporate Fitch's expectation that the company will  maintain a strong financial profile over the long term despite near term  weakness in its agricultural and construction equipment markets that are  contributing to higher leverage and reduced free cash flow (FCF). Fitch expects  the company will reduce discretionary spending for share repurchases and take  actions to reduce its cost structure to support margins at lower sales volumes  and that credit metrics will recover when the current cycle reverses. Potential  support required from Deere Equipment for Financial Services represents a risk,  but is viewed by Fitch as unlikely. The current downturn in Deere's agricultural equipment market follows a cyclical  peak in 2013 and is the most severe since 1979-1986 as measured by the  cumulative decline in industry sales and the length of the downturn. There are  indications that demand could begin to stabilize sometime in 2017, but the  timing of a meaningful recovery is uncertain and could be delayed by low crop  prices, net cash farm income which could decline for a fourth consecutive year  in 2016, weak farmer sentiment, and high levels of used equipment. U.S. farm  balance sheets are relatively strong but concerns have been increasing about  agricultural credit conditions and declines in the value of farmland that have  occurred since early 2014. Deere's results are also being negatively affected by  low energy prices which reduce demand for construction equipment.  Rating strengths include Deere's position as the largest U.S. manufacturer of  agricultural equipment with a broad product line, particularly in the large  equipment market. Revenue is concentrated in developed markets but is growing in  emerging markets as farmers look to increase production and invest in larger,  mechanized equipment. Deere also has a leading share in forestry equipment in  North America. The company's market positions in turf and construction equipment  are competitive, but it has a smaller share than some other large competitors in  these markets. Fitch expects Deere's well-established position in precision agriculture should  support future performance as the industry becomes increasingly reliant on  digital technology. Technological applications are also relevant to the  construction, forestry and turf markets. In precision agriculture, Deere uses a  combination of acquisitions and agreements to expand its presence in digital  applications. Fitch also recognizes competitive risks from competitors in  Deere's agricultural markets as well as other providers of data services and  analytics.  Fitch expects Deere Equipment's leverage and other credit metrics will be weak  compared to mid-cycle levels until demand improves. Debt/EBITDA was 2x at July  31, 2016 and Fitch estimates it could increase to approximately 2.3x in the near  to medium term before the company's end markets improve. By comparison,  debt/EBITDA was 1.1x as recently as the end of 2013.  EBITDA margins of 7.7% on a latest 12 months (LTM) basis at July 31, 2016 were  approximately half of the peak level of 14.3% in 2013 as calculated by Fitch.  Margins could begin to improve in fiscal 2017 as Deere implements cost  reductions the company estimates could total at least $500 million annually by  the end of 2018. Results at Financial Services are being negatively affected by  lower residual values on leased equipment and higher provisions for credit  losses, but Fitch believes delinquencies are at manageable levels and they  remain slightly below the long term average.  FCF at Deere Equipment, including dividends received from financial services,  has declined significantly due to weaker operating results but remains positive.  Fitch expects FCF after corporate dividends will be approximately $500 million  in 2016 (slightly negative excluding dividends from Financial Services) compared  to $1.5 billion in 2015.  The impact of lower operating cash flow expected by Fitch is partly offset by a  reduction in capital expenditures which were high prior to 2015 when Deere was  expanding capacity and developing Tier 4 emissions-compliant engines. Deere  Equipment receives dividends from Financial Services that totaled $680 million  in 2015. Fitch expects dividends from Financial Services could decline in 2016  based on the downturn in agricultural equipment which is contributing to higher  losses on lease residual values and higher provisions for credit losses. The  dividends can vary depending on cash requirements at each business.  Fitch expects capital expenditures and dividends will remain relatively stable  until conditions improve and Deere is able to rebuild its operating performance.  Cash deployment for share repurchases has been much lower in 2016 following  several years of high spending that was largely funded by strong FCF. Pension  plans are well funded and contributions in 2016 are estimated by Deere at $80  million. As of the Oct. 31, 2015, the net pension obligation totaled $1 billion  (92% funded).  Transactions between Deere Equipment and Financial Services include receivables  from unconsolidated subsidiaries and affiliates. The majority of these  receivables, which totaled, $2.4 billion at July 31, 2016, were due from  Financial Services. Deere uses these receivables, as well as capital  contributions to, and dividends from, Financial Services to manage leverage at  Financial Services and use consolidated cash effectively.  Under Fitch's criteria for rating non-financial corporates, Fitch calculates an  appropriate debt/equity ratio of 6x at Financial Services based on solid asset  quality, sufficient liquidity and strong funding profile. Actual debt/equity as  measured by Fitch, including intangible assets, was 7.7x as of July 31, 2016. As  a result, an equity injection of approximately $1.1 billion would be needed to  reduce Financial Services leverage to 6x. Fitch assumes Deere could reclassify  as equity a portion of intercompany receivables due from Financial Services that  totaled $2.4 billion as of July 31, 2016. As a result, it would not be necessary  for Deere to issue debt to fund the equity injection.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - JDCC JDCC's long- and short-term ratings are equalized with Deere's ratings,  reflecting Fitch's view of JDCC as a core subsidiary of Deere based on the 100%  ownership, shared brand name, importance of JDCC to help Deere achieve its  strategic objectives and the Support Agreement between the two entities. The  Support Agreement requires Deere to maintain 51% ownership of JDCC, maintain  JDCC's net worth at not less than $50 million, and maintain JDCC's fixed-charge  coverage at not less than 1.05x on a quarterly basis.  Beyond these support-driven considerations, Fitch also considers JDCC's  consistent operating performance, solid asset quality through cycles, sufficient  liquidity, and strong funding profile. These factors are counterbalanced by  JDCC's elevated leverage relative to stand-alone finance companies, but  consistent with captive finance peer averages.  Asset quality metrics were solid, despite an uptick in write-offs during 2016.  At July 31, 2016, delinquencies greater than 30 days past due amounted to 1.51%  compared to 1.03% one-year prior. Write-offs, net of recoveries were $53.5  million or 0.25% of net finance receivables in the first nine months of fiscal  year (FY) 2016 compared to $30.7 million or 0.14% of net finance receivables in  the same period in FY 2015. The increase in write-offs was driven by  construction and forestry retail notes and revolving credit lines. The allowance  for credit losses amounted to $113.3 million, or 0.39% of net finance  receivables, as of July 31, 2016. Given strong asset quality performance over  the last several years, metrics are expected to normalize in the medium term.  Fitch believes JDCC's loss reserves are sufficient to cover potential losses on  its receivables.  Operating performance remained consistent, albeit weaker than 2015, amid weaker  economic conditions that contributed to increased credit costs and lower  origination volumes. JDCC reported revenues through the first nine months of FY  2016 of $1.55 billion, a 7.4% increase from the same period in the prior fiscal  year. Pretax income was $398 million, or a 31.5% decrease. This translated to  pre-tax ROAA of 1.65%, which is lower than the four-year average of 2.34%. Net  income amounted to $258.6 million, or a 31.1% decrease year-over-year. The  declines were primarily due to higher losses on lease residual values, less  favorable financing spreads and a higher provision for credit losses.  Despite  year-over-year volatility and weakness, Fitch expects overall operating  performance will remain relatively stable and the company will remain profitable  in the near- to medium-term.  JDCC's debt-to-tangible equity was 8.17x as of July 31, 2016, up from 7.87x at  the end of FY 2015 and 7.82x at FYE 2014. Fitch notes that leverage remains  consistent with other captive finance peers but higher than many stand-alone  finance companies. Fitch does not anticipate any significant changes in JDCC's  overall capital structure. Should funding requirements increase, Fitch believes  Deere would inject additional capital into the finance arm, as necessary, to  manage JDCC's overall leverage profile.  Fitch believes JDCC's comprehensive funding platform, in combination with the  financial strength of its parent, is consistent with other captive finance  companies.   KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case for Deere Equipment include: --Deere's revenue declines approximately 10% in 2016; --The industry downturn in agricultural equipment approaches a cyclical trough  in 2017;  --EBITDA margins fall by more than half on an aggregate basis between the  industry peak in 2013 and the end of 2016 but begin to recover in 2017;  --FCF declines to approximately $500 million in 2016 including dividends from  Financial Services;  --Share repurchases are reduced in 2016 to much lower levels compared to more  than $2 billion in each of the past two years.  Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case for JDCC include: JDCC's long- and short-term ratings are equalized with Deere's ratings,  reflecting Fitch's view of JDCC as a core subsidiary of Deere based on the 100%  ownership, shared brand name, importance of JDCC to help Deere achieve its  strategic objectives and the Support Agreement between the two entities. RATING SENSITIVITIES Deere Equipment  Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a negative  rating action include: --Loss of significant market share in the company's agricultural, construction  and forestry equipment markets; --Margins fail to improve materially as Deere implements restructuring and when  market demand eventually recovers; --Deere's precision agriculture and other digital strategies become  uncompetitive; --Cash deployment for share repurchases or acquisitions leads to materially  higher leverage; --Financial Services requires significant support that reduces Deere's liquidity  and financial flexibility. Fitch views a positive rating action as unlikely over the rating horizon due to  cyclicality in Deere's agricultural and construction markets and to funding and  credit risks at Financial Services.  JDCC Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a negative  rating action include: --A change in the perceived relationship between Deere and JDCC, for example, if  Fitch believed that JDCC was no longer core to Deere's strategic operations  and/or adequate financial support was not provided to the captive finance  company in a time of need; --Significant asset quality deterioration; --Consistent operating losses; --A material change in balance sheet leverage; --Deterioration in JDCC's liquidity profile. Positive rating momentum for JDCC and its subsidiaries would be limited by  Fitch's view of Deere's credit profile, as JDCC's ratings and Outlook are linked  to that of its parent. Fitch cannot envision a scenario where the captive would  be rated higher than its parent.  LIQUIDITY AND DEBT STRUCTURE Deere Equipment's liquidity at July 31, 2016 included cash of $3.1 billion,  excluding $40 million of marketable securities, and availability under two $2.9  billion revolvers shared with JDCC that mature in 2020 and 2021. The agreements  require JDCC to maintain minimum fixed charge coverage and maximum  debt-to-capital ratios, and Deere Equipment to maintain a maximum  debt-to-capital ratio, all of which were in compliance as of July 31, 2016.  Deere also has $1.5 billion of other committed and uncommitted facilities.  Liquidity was offset by $262 million of short-term debt and long-term debt  maturities.  JDCC's liquidity is sufficient given consistent operating cash flow generation,  available cash on hand of $1.1 billion as of July 31, 2016 and undrawn capacity  under its credit facilities. JDCC relies on the global debt capital markets,  various bank funding programs as well as periodic ordinary support from Deere to  provide liquidity for its operations. Additionally, 80.9% of JDCC's debt was  unsecured, as of July 31, 2016. This is viewed positively by Fitch, as  unencumbered assets provide balance sheet flexibility in times of market stress.

Fitch  conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it  in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification  of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are  available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's  factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains  will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the  requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is  offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of  relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its  advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as  audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports,  engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties,  the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources  with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the  issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports  should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any  third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on  in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete.  Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the  information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and  other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the  work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial  statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings  and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking  and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature  cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current  facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that  were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.  The information in this report is provided ""as is"" without any representation or  warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or  any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the  report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security.  This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and  methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore,  ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual,  or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or   a report. The  rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk,  unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or  sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals  identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible  for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes  only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute  for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer  and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be  changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch.  Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a  recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the  adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular  investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to  any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other  obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from  US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In  certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular  issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a  single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000  (or the applicable currency equivalent).

145,"   By Meredith Davis  Shares of Deere & Co (DE.N) jumped 11 percent to an all-time high on Wednesday after stronger pricing and cost cuts allowed the agricultural and construction machine manufacturer to beat quarterly earnings expectations.  Factors ranging from machinery pricing to lower overheads spending helped Deere report a much smaller-than-expected decline in quarterly earnings, CFO Raj Kalathur said on a conference call.Higher sales volumes, an improved product mix and lower materials costs and research and development spending, also contributed, Kalathur added. Less discounting during the quarter, especially on agricultural machinery, contributed to higher pricing, Tony Huegel, director of investor relations said during the conference call. ""It was all kind of internal - either pricing or cost cutting,"" said Jefferies analyst Stephen Volkmann. ""It's not that the cycle is turning, it is that they are managing it better than before.""Deere forecast revenue for the new fiscal year would fall about 1 percent from $26.6 billion in 2016, while analysts on average forecast a 3 percent decline for 2017. Deere said it expected its equipment sales to decrease about 1 percent for fiscal 2017 and to fall about 4 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier. While still a decline, it is less steep than the net sales decline of 9 percent in fiscal 2016, compared with 2015. The company also saw fiscal 2017 net income declining to about $1.4 billion, from $1.52 billion in fiscal 2016.""The farm economy will not get better until you see farmer income levels rising, which have not for some years,"" Argus Research analyst Bill Selesky said.Deere shares were up $10.34 to trade at $102.35 their highest level in Reuters data going back to 1980. Deere forecast 2017 U.S. farm cash receipts would remain steady with 2016, a sign the agricultural recession may be easing, at least in the United States. While Deere's revenue fell 3 percent to $6.52 billion, it still beat analysts' estimates of $5.38 billion.Net income attributable to Deere fell to $285.3 million, or 90 cents per share, in the fourth quarter ended on Oct. 31 from $351.2 million, or $1.08 per share, a year earlier.Analysts on average had expected 40 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Weak commodity prices and low farm income are both expected to contribute to a 5 percent to 10 percent decline in full-year 2017 U.S. agricultural and turf industry sales of both large and small equipment, the company said.
