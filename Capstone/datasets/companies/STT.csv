0,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, January 24 (Fitch) State Street Corporationâ€™s (STT) fourth quarter 2013  (4Qâ€™13) stated net income of $545 million modestly increased from $531 million  in the sequential quarter, but up from $468 million in the year-ago quarter,  according to Fitch Ratings.  Both favorable comparisons are largely reflective  of improved equity markets over the course of the year, which boosted both asset  servicing and asset management fees, partially offset by higher costs relative  to the sequential quarter. These earnings equated to a 10.9% return on equity (ROE) in 4Qâ€™13, up from a  10.8% ROE in the sequential quarter, and a 9.3% ROE in the year-ago quarter.   Fitch continues to view these results as satisfactory from a credit perspective,  but below the companyâ€™s long-term historical averages. Given the challenging low interest rate environment, the contribution to overall  revenue from net interest income (NII) continues to remain on the lower side  relative to historical averages.  STT has, however, benefited from slower  prepayments on its mortgage backed securities (MBS) portfolio, which slowed  premium amortization which has helped to modestly support its net interest  margin (NIM).  As of 4Qâ€™13, the NIM increased 3 basis points from the sequential  quarter to 1.30% on an operating basis. Additionally, low foreign exchange (FOREX) volatility, as well as some  disintermediation from new electronic FOREX firms has pressured the companyâ€™s  trading revenue, which is lower relative to both the sequential and year-ago  quarters. Offsetting the weakness in market based revenue has been an improvement in fee  revenue given higher equity markets and some good new business growth,  particularly in STTâ€™s alternative asset servicing area.  Fitch would expect  continued growth in alternative asset servicing revenue given STTâ€™s good new  business wins during the quarter. Fitch believes that STTâ€™s focus on expense control as well as its operations and  information technology (ops and IT) transformation program has been good, and  created the potential for very significant operating leverage at some point in  the future when short-term interest rates rise.  Now, however, many of these  savings have been offset by higher compliance and regulatory costs over the  course of the last year.  Fitch continues to expect these elevated environmental  costs to persist over the near term. Fitch continues to believe that STTâ€™s capital and liquidity positions remain  good.  STTâ€™s Tier 1 common (CET1) ratio under Basel I of 15.5% is good, and  unchanged from the sequential quarter despite $560 million of share buybacks  during the quarter.  The pro forma CET1 ratio under Basel III standardized  approach was 10.1% at 4Qâ€™13, and under the advanced approach was 11.8% at 4Qâ€™13,  both of which Fitch views as solid. Additionally, STTâ€™s Basel III supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) was 5.2% at the  holding company which is above the 5.0% proposed minimum and 5.0% at its main  bank subsidiary, State Street Bank & Trust Company, which is below the current  6.0% proposed minimum.

6,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, March 26 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the Support Ratings (SRs)  and Support Rating Floors (SRFs) at '1' and 'A', respectively, for Bank of New  York Mellon Corporation (BK), State Street Corporation (STT), and Wells Fargo &  Company (WFC). The rating actions have been taken in conjunction with a review  of support for banks globally.  BK's, STT's, and WFC's IDRs do not currently incorporate any government support,  and reflect their standalone strengths only. As such, absent a material in  change economic conditions or the companies' stand-alone credit profiles, a  future change to their SRs or SRFs will have no impact on the companies' IDRs. KEY RATING DRIVERS - SUPPORT RATINGS AND SUPPORT RATING FLOORS BK's, STT's, and WFC's current SRs and SRFs reflect Fitch's expectation that  there remains an extremely high probability of support from the U.S. government  (rated 'AAA', Rating Outlook Stable) if required. This expectation reflects the  U.S.'s extremely high ability to support its banks especially given its strong  financial flexibility, though propensity is becoming less certain. Specific to  BK, STT, and WFC, our view of support likelihood is based mostly on their  systemic importance in the U.S., their global interconnectedness given their  size and operations in global capital markets, significant deposit market share  and their positions as key providers of financial services to the U.S. economy.  BK's, STT's, and WFC's IDRs and senior debt ratings do not benefit from support  because their VRs are all above their SRF. However, in Fitch's view, there is a clear intention to reduce support for  G-SIFIs in the U.S., as demonstrated by the Dodd Frank Act (DFA) and progress  regulators have made on implementing the Orderly Liquidation Authority (OLA).  The FDIC has proposed its single point of entry (SPOE) strategy and further  initiatives are demonstrating the U.S. government's progress to eliminate state  support for U.S. banks going forward, which increases the likelihood of senior  debt losses if its banks run afoul of solvency assessments. RATING SENSITVITIES - SUPPORT RATINGS AND SUPPORT RATING FLOORS The SRs and SRFs are sensitive to progress made in finalizing the SPOE strategy  and any additional regulatory initiatives that may be imposed on the G-SIFIs,  including debt thresholds at the holding company. Fitch's assessment of  continuing support for U.S. G-SIFIs has to some extent relied upon the  feasibility of OLA implementation rather than its enactment into law (when DFA  passed). Hurdles that remain include the resolution of how cross-border  derivative acceleration/termination provisions are handled and that there is  sufficient contingent capital at the holding company to recapitalize without  requiring government assistance. Fitch expects that the SPOE strategy and regulatory action to ensure sufficient  contingent capital will be finalized in the near term, but regardless of its  finalization, Fitch believes that sufficient regulatory progress continues to be  made over the ratings time horizon. Therefore, Fitch expects to revise BK's,  STT's, and WFC's SRs to '5' and SRFs to 'No Floor' within the next one to two  years, likely to be some point in late 2014 or in 1H15. Absent a material in change economic conditions or the companies' stand-alone  credit profiles, a revision of the SRFs to 'No Floor' would mean no change to  BK's, STT's, or WFC's Long-term IDRs and debt ratings because their viability  ratings are all above their SRFs. Fitch has affirmed the following ratings. All other ratings are unaffected.

8,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, April 25 (Fitch) State Street Corporation's (STT) first quarter 2014  (1Q'14) earnings were reflective of the continued protracted low short-term  interest rate environment, which continues to pressure the company's return on  equity (ROE), according to Fitch Ratings.  STT's ROE for 1Q'14 was 7.2% on a  stated basis, or 8.8% on an operating basis (this measure excludes some one-time  charges), which is a decline from the sequential quarter on either measure and  relatively flat result from the year-ago quarter.  While Fitch views this return  as satisfactory from a credit perspective, it remains below the company's  long-term averages and Fitch's estimate of STT's long-term cost of equity. Overall revenue was essentially flat from the sequential quarter, and up very  modestly from the year-ago quarter as growth in fee revenue continued to be  offset by declines in net interest revenue (NIR).  Both asset servicing and  asset management fees were flat relative to the sequential quarter, but showed  strong growth relative to the year-ago quarter thanks in part to higher stock  markets over the course of 2013.  Fitch would expect some new business wins to  help support STT's fee revenue over the course of the year, but without the  tailwinds of rapidly rising markets (as was the case in 2013) Fitch expects  overall fee revenue growth to be much more modest in 2014. STT's market based revenue, which includes securities finance and foreign  exchange (fx) trading was up nearly 5% from the sequential quarter, but down  relative to the year-ago quarter.  This continues to be a challenging area for  STT--and other trust banks--and Fitch would expect it to remain so without a  significant increase in FX volatility. STT's NIR continues to decline amid low short-term interest rates and the  company's somewhat short duration of its securities portfolio.  The company's  net interest margin (NIM) declined to 1.24% in 1Q'14, down from 1.30% in the  sequential quarter, and 1.31% in the year-ago quarter.  As long as short-term  interest rates remain at generation lows, Fitch would expect some continue  margin compression as asset yields modestly reprice down and funding costs are  at or near absolute lows. That said, Fitch continues to note that STT--as well as many other financial  institutions--is very sensitive to higher short-term interest rates.  Should  short-term rates increase at some point, Fitch would expect meaningful earnings  expansion for STT.  Until then, however, significant improvement in STT's ROE is  likely to be challenging. Given the revenue challenges noted above, STT has been carefully managing its  expense base and has been engaging in cost savings programs.  Nevertheless,  expenses still grew faster than revenue relative to both the sequential and  year-ago quarters due in large part to higher compensation expenses.  Fitch  would expect STT to continue to manage its expense base as best as possible over  the balance of the year. Fitch believes that STT's capital and liquidity positions remains good.  STT's  Tier 1 common (CET1) ratio under Basel III transitionally phased-in was 11.1%  under the standardized approach and 13.2% under the advanced approach.  This  included the phase in  of the the deduction of other intangible assets, which  will be deducted by 20% per year until fully phased in at Jan. 1, 2018. STT's supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) of 6.4% at the holding company and 6%  at the bank level, were in compliance with minimum requirements.  However, since  they were also impacted by the other intangible asset item noted above, Fitch  would expect continued enhancements of these ratios until they are fully phased  in.

12,"   By Ross Kerber and Tim McLaughlin | June 30  June 30 Activist investor Nelson Peltz has built up a $1 billion stake in BNY Mellon Corp in what could lead to a shakeup over lagging stock performance and rising operating expenses at the world's largest custody bank.Shares of BNY rose more than 2 percent.Peltz's Trian Fund Management LP ""has recently contacted the Bank of New York Mellon to express its interest in discussing Trian's ideas and initiatives to drive long-term growth and enhance shareholder value with the company's management and its board,"" according to a person familiar with Trian's thinking.Funds managed by Trian collectively own about 28.9 million shares, or about 2 percent, of BNY Mellon after adding to the stake in the first quarter, according to disclosures with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the person familiar with Trian's investment strategy. ""Trian is a respected investment firm,"" BNY Mellon spokesman Kevin Heine said. ""We are looking forward to engaging with them, as we do all our investors."" He declined to comment further.BNY Mellon's shares were up 2.2 percent at $37.03 in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange. But the stock has severely lagged the broader market's recovery over the past five years. Trian is known for pressing for change at companies in  which it invests. In October 2011, for example, Trian issued a top-to-bottom critique of BNY Mellon's top rival, State Street Corp, which it said had paid too much for acquisitions and sacrificed profits for revenue growth while allowing compensation expenses to balloon.Trian also pushed State Street to consider separating the asset management and custody bank divisions. State Street kept its division intact, but did lower compensation costs. Some analysts have criticized BNY Mellon for allowing its compensation costs to creep upward and have recommended that the bank spin off its asset management division.CLSA Securities analyst Mike Mayo, for example, said in a February report that BNY had the worst pre-tax profit margin of its peer group and that the asset management arm would be more valuable if it were spun off from the custody bank.BNY Mellon executives have been steadfast in keeping the asset management arm tied to the company's custody business. For example, at a May investment conference, Chief Executive Officer Gerald Hassell said asset management was complementary to investment services because its index and money market offerings were ""extremely attractive to our servicing clients.""Over the past 12 months, BNY Mellon shares have rallied, rising 33 percent and beating the 22 percent advance of the Standard & Poor's 500 index. But over the past five years, the S&P 500 is up 113 percent, while BNY is up only 27 percent.

19,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, July 22 (Fitch) State Street Corporation's (STT) second quarter 2014  (2Q'14) earnings were more of the same, according to the review by Fitch  Ratings,  as growth in core asset servicing and asset management revenue was  offset by continued expense growth and weakness in market-based revenue amid the  protracted low interest rates and low volatility. Overall, STT's return on equity (ROE) in 2Q'14 was 11.9%, which was up from the  7.3% ROE in the sequential quarter and 11.3% in the year-ago quarter.  While  Fitch views STT's earnings as satisfactory from a credit perspective and also  views the moderate improvement positively, it also notes that STT's results  remain below the company's long-term averages.  Fitch believes this level of  earnings performance is likely to persist until either short-term interest rates  increase (whenever that may be) or foreign exchange volatility increases. STT's core asset servicing and management franchise performed well during the  quarter as asset servicing fees increased 4.0% from the sequential quarter and  7.2% from the year-ago quarter.  Similarly, asset management also performed well  with management fees up 2.7% from the sequential quarter and a solid 8.3% from  the year-ago quarter.  These improvements reflected $250 billion of new assets  to be serviced and $18  billion of new assets to be managed as well as higher  markets particularly relative to the year-ago comparisons. As previously noted, growth in market-based revenue for STT - as well as the  rest of the industry - continued to be constrained.  During the quarter,  securities finance revenue seasonally expanded while foreign exchange (FX)  revenue continued to decline.  FX revenue declined amid continued low global FX  volatility despite improved volumes. Net Interest Revenue (NIR) modestly expanded relative to the sequential quarter  largely due to growth in the balance sheet amid strong deposit inflows, but  declined relative to the year-ago quarter. The company's net interest margin  (NIM) also declined to 1.12% in 2Q'14 reflective of continued pressure on  investment yields.  That said, Fitch continues to expect STT to be very  sensitive to higher short-term interest rates whenever they eventually rise. Expense management remains a key focus for STT, as management continues to  optimize its cost base amid the challenging interest rate environment and higher  regulatory costs.  Expenses benefited relative to the sequential quarter on  lower deferred compensation costs, but rose faster than revenue relative to the  year-ago quarter. Despite management's continued good execution on its Business Operations and  Technology Transformation program, higher regulatory and compliance costs  continue to offset some of the savings the program has achieved.  As a result,  STT now expects it will be more challenging to achieve its goal of positive  annual operating leverage in 2014, without a pick-up in the company's  market-based revenue. Fitch continues to consider STT's liquidity position to be sound.  The company's  capital ratios are good as well, particularly considering the risk profile of  its balance sheet. STT's estimated Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio under the  Basel III transitionally phased-in standardized approach was good at 11.3%.   Additionally, STT's supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) was 6.1% at the holding  company and 5.8% at the main bank subsidiary, State Street Bank & Trust Company,  both of which are currently in compliance with regulatory proposals.

21,"  * Asset managers to accept proposals charging for orders* Response to FSB paper next week should speed work on reform* Opposition to moving away from existing fixings* Banks, funds anxious to move on from scandalBy Patrick Graham and Huw JonesLONDON, Aug 8 Asset managers will agree to pay more for currency ""fixing"" services when they respond later this month to proposals by global regulators for reforms of foreign exchange benchmarks, industry sources said on Friday.Almost two years after some fund managers raised concern over how banks dealt with their orders to exchange currency at daily fixings, regulators have identified a key source of tension in the system: the zero fee banks charge their biggest clients for such orders.The Financial Stability Board's consultation paper on reform, written chiefly by the Bank of England's executive director for regulation, Paul Fisher, recommended that funds pay banks either a straight fee or a ""spread"" premium to the fixing rate for orders executed. That reflects complaints by banks that the orders they promise to execute at the benchmark rates are a loss-leader and put pressure on traders to find creative ways to offset the risk involved.""There is acceptance that asset managers will have to pay a broker charge but that it should be a minimum charge to cover costs of trading and not some wheeze to generate income for banks,"" one official from the European asset management industry told Reuters.So far, 40 bank traders have been fired, suspended or put on leave in a row over alleged rigging of the currency benchmarks, although no-one has been formally accused and regulators are yet to publish any clear evidence of misconduct. RESIGNED Senior managers at two other European asset managers told Reuters the sector was resigned to paying more towards the system, but that it must come in exchange for more transparency and certainty that the system will be clean going forward.""They may be a trade off between the integrity of the fixing and paying a little bit,"" said one fund manager who executes around $500 billion in currency deals annually, speaking on condition of anonymity. ""Asset managers who trade pretty well get FX costs of around 10 basis points. If my tracking error on my portfolio as a whole was a couple of basis points then that would probably be ok.""In line with feedback from banks over the past couple of months, one of the sources said it was clear that the industry wanted to continue with the existing fixings, although it was open to some of the other proposals in the FSB document.Specifically, he said there was likely to be acceptance of some widening of the fixing window and of the idea of a new system that seeks to match off and execute fixing orders in isolation from speculative traders like hedge funds and banks' spot desks.The benchmark at the centre of the market-rigging investigations is the 4 p.m. WM/Reuters currency fix in London, which uses a 60-second window to set key exchange rates. That could be expanded to 15 minutes on either side.The London fix relates to several exchange rates and is compiled using data from Thomson Reuters and other providers and calculated by WM, a unit of State Street Corp STT.N. Thomson Reuters is the parent company of Reuters News, which is not involved in the fixing process.A number of bank officials have told Reuters that the proposals for an independent matching utility may founder on the difficulty of managing the risk of orders that then have to be executed in the broader market. They also say it would be likely to cost more than the existing processes.

These ratings actions were taking in conjunction with Fitch's U.S. trust and  processing bank peer review.  A full list of ratings follows at the end of this  release.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - IDRS, VR, AND Senior Debt Today's rating actions equalizes the ratings of the largest standalone trust and  processing banks (trust banks) in the United States at 'AA-/F1+'. Brown  Brothers, a privately held partnership, remains one notch lower at 'A+/F1' given  its smaller scale and comparatively less financial flexibility than the larger,  publicly traded companies. The upgrade of State Street's ratings and Outlook revision reflects the  company's improved and more seasoned risk management practices and procedures,  continued relatively conservative overall balance sheet posture, and continued  efforts in streamlining its business, which Fitch believes will lead to more  significant positive operating leverage in a higher short-term interest rate  environment. The high ratings for all the trust banks noted above reflect business models  with high barriers to entry and sticky customer relationships, which would be  extremely difficult for a new entrant into the marketplace to replicate.  Furthermore, the strong franchises of the trust banks are further supported by a  sound funding profile, consisting mainly of core custody deposits, strong  capital ratios supporting comparatively low risk balance sheets, and good asset  quality metrics. Further, while there has been significant pressure on these firms' results amid  the protracted low interest rate environment coupled with a period of extremely  low volatility, these firms' returns on equity (ROE) have still remained  satisfactory from a credit perspective at around 10% on average, though these  results are below the trust banks (excluding Brown Brothers, whose returns  remain relatively good) long-term averages and Fitch's long-term cost of equity  assumption for the trust banks of between 12% to 15%. Fitch believes these  company's current level of operating performance amid the difficult market and  interest rate environment of the last several years, indicates a significant  amount of resiliency in the trust bank business model. While the resiliency of the business model is in part due to high barriers to  entry noted above, which has resulted in a somewhat oligopolistic industry, the  trust banks have not benefited from pricing power which one would think given  the competitive positioning of the industry. Rather, those with the lower cost  operating model can typically achieve greater scale, which can lead to more  aggressive pricing, though also outsize returns for the low-cost provider. As such, each firm has had a laser focus on managing its expense base over the  last few years. This has included optimizing each firm's respective workforce as  well as improving efficiencies and streamlining operations through significant  technology investments. While the results to date have been mixed, as much of  the expense savings noted above have been offset by significant additional  expenditures on regulatory and compliance functions and personnel, Fitch  believes that the groundwork for good positive operating leverage has been laid  for each of the firms. To wit, the trust banks are very sensitive to higher short-term interest rates,  whenever that may occur, as well as higher volatility, particularly in the  foreign exchange (FX) markets. As such, Fitch expects a meaningful acceleration  in each of the trust bank's earnings once some of the regulatory and compliance  costs the firms are currently incurring level-off, and as soon as the companies  begin to benefit from higher short-term interest rates or increased FX  volatility, or both simultaneously. This eventual earnings acceleration should  boost ROEs back to historical levels and in line with Fitch's cost of equity  assumptions and is embedded with Fitch's Stable Rating Outlook on the trust  banks. Offsetting the strengths noted above is an elevated level of operational risk  inherent in the trust bank's business models, which serves as limiting factor  for upwards rating momentum.  To this end, Fitch believes that the main threat to each firm's business model  and ratings would result from a large technological mishap or operational loss  that is idiosyncratic to one company resulting in reputational damage causing  clients to flee the firm. Fitch does believe these risks are well monitored and  controlled, but also acknowledges that they are inherently difficult to predict  and quantify. As such, a large occurrence at any one firm would likely prompt  Fitch to review ratings to determine if a negative rating action was appropriate An industry wide event that causes a significant operational loss that affects  each firm equally may still impact ratings, but may also allow each firm to  better maintain its client base. RATING SENSITIVITIES - IDRs, VR, AND SENIOR DEBT With today's actions, Fitch now believes that the trust bank's ratings are  solidly situated at their current rating levels and Stable Rating Outlooks. However, it is possible that over a very long-term time horizon there is some  potential upside to Brown Brother's ratings. This could be predicated on  increasing scale and revenue diversity, particularly through increasing the  revenue contribution from the asset management segment. In addition to the operational risks noted earlier in this release, there are  some key risks from currently evolving regulatory changes that could impact the  trust banks and their rates. The most significant on the horizon is the proposed regulatory changes regarding  the supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) in the U.S. for both BONY and State  Street. Given their smaller size, Northern and Brown Brothers are not subject to  the SLR. The SLR requires a leverage ratio of 5% at the holding company and 6%  at the main bank subsidiary for each firm. While Fitch believes that each firm will be in compliance with SLR requirements  when they are finalized and come into practice, given the countercyclical nature  of some of the deposit flows to BONY and State Street during periods of market  stress, each firm has the risk of falling below their SLR minimums in such a  scenario. There is still a small possibility that the rule could be altered to give relief  to the companies during times of market stress. The companies are also looking  at alternative mechanisms or structures to move deposits off-balance sheet into  money funds or other vehicles to help manage the SLR. To the extent that these  strategies cause unintended increases in risk to the respective balance sheets  could also impact ratings. Further, additional regulation including the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), Net  Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR), Basel III operational risk weightings, and  potential minimum debt requirements, while all aimed at reducing explicit risks  to various stakeholders, also has the potential to create unintended risks,  which Fitch will evaluate over time for any risks created. For example, should some of the regulation noted above force firms to divest  themselves of core businesses or move away from core competencies such that it  negatively impacts the franchise, could be a negative ratings driver over time. Ratings for BONY and State Street are highly sensitive to Fitch's ultimate  position on potential minimum debt requirements, which were published in a paper  on March 27, 2014 titled 'U.S. Bank HoldCos & OpCos:  Evolving Risk Profiles'.  This paper indicated that Fitch could decide to notch key banking subsidiaries  from holding companies (either the holding company is downgraded or the bank  level subsidiary is upgraded) should Fitch determine proposed minimum debt  requirements along with the FDIC's Orderly Liquidation Authority changes the  risk profiles of the two entities. Fitch would also note that it considers various market risks on the trust banks  and has complied a stress test on the company's earnings which include scenarios  such as a simultaneous 40% decline in equity markets, 5% decline in fixed income  markets, and interest rates remaining flat at today's current low levels. In  this scenario, Fitch believes that each firm's annual earnings should remain  around break-even or at a modest loss incorporating very large litigation  charges in the stress. Fitch believes this result adds support to each firm's  ratings and Stable Rating Outlook. KEY RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES - SUPPORT RATINGS (SR) AND SUPPORT FLOOR  RATINGS (SRF) BONY and State Streets' current SRs and SRFs reflect Fitch's expectation that  there remains an extremely high probability of support from the U.S. government  (rated 'AAA'; Outlook Stable by Fitch) if required. This expectation reflects  the U.S.'s extremely high ability to support its banks especially given its  strong financial flexibility, though propensity is becoming less certain.  Specific to BONY and State Street our view of support likelihood is based mostly  on their systemic importance in the U.S., their global interconnectedness given  their size and operations in global capital markets, significant deposit market  share and their positions as key providers of financial services to the U.S.  economy. BONY and State Street's IDRs and senior debt ratings do not benefit  from support because their VRs are all above their SRF. However, in Fitch's view, there is a clear intention to reduce support for  G-SIFIs in the U.S., as demonstrated by the Dodd Frank Act (DFA) and progress  regulators have made on implementing the Orderly Liquidation Authority (OLA).  The FDIC has proposed its single point of entry (SPOE) strategy and further  initiatives are demonstrating the U.S. government's progress to eliminate state  support for U.S. banks going forward, which increases the likelihood of senior  debt losses if its banks run afoul of solvency assessments. The SRs and SRFs are sensitive to progress made in finalizing the SPOE strategy  and any additional regulatory initiatives that may be imposed on the G-SIFIs,  including debt thresholds at the holding company. Fitch's assessment of  continuing support for U.S. G-SIFIs has to some extent relied upon the  feasibility of OLA implementation rather than its enactment into law (when DFA  passed). Hurdles that remain include the resolution of how cross-border  derivative acceleration/termination provisions are handled and that there is  sufficient contingent capital at the holding company to recapitalize without  requiring government assistance. Fitch expects the SPOE strategy and regulatory action to ensure sufficient  contingent capital will be finalized in the near term. However, regardless of  its finalization, Fitch believes that sufficient regulatory progress continues  to be made over the ratings time horizon. Therefore, Fitch expects to revise  BONY and State Street's SRs to '5' and SRFs to 'No Floor' within the next one to  two years; likely to be some point in late 2014 or in 1H15.  Absent a material in change economic conditions or the companies' stand-alone  credit profiles a revision of the SRFs to 'No Floor' would mean no change to  BONY or State Street's Long-term IDRs and debt ratings because their viability  ratings are all above their SRFs. Northern and Brown Brothers already have SR's of '5' and SRF's of 'No Floor' and  are not designated G-SIFIs so would not likely have a potential minimum debt  requirement. KEY RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES - LONG AND SHORT TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS The trust bank's uninsured deposit ratings at the subsidiary banks are rated one  notch higher than the company's IDR and senior unsecured debt because U.S.  uninsured deposits benefit from depositor preference. U.S. depositor preference  gives deposit liabilities superior recovery prospects in the event of default. The ratings of long and short-term deposits issued by the trust banks and its  subsidiaries are primarily sensitive to any change in the company's IDR. This  means that should a Long-term IDR be downgraded, deposit ratings could be  similarly impacted.  KEY RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES - SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID  SECURITIES Subordinated debt and other hybrid capital issued by the trust banks and by  various issuing vehicles are all notched down from the holding company or its  bank subsidiaries' VRs in accordance with Fitch's assessment of each  instrument's respective non-performance and relative loss severity risk  profiles. BONY, Northern, and Brown Brothers' subordinated debt has been  affirmed due to the affirmation of those companies VRs. State Street's  subordinated debt has been upgraded in concert with the upgrade of the company's  VR. VR's. Ratings are primarily sensitive to any change in the VRs, where the notching  would be realigned in conjunction with any change in the VR. KEY RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES - HOLDING COMPANY The IDRs and VRs of BONY, State Street, and Northern are equalized with those  ratings of its operating companies and banks, reflecting its role as the bank  holding company, which is mandated in the U.S. to act as a source of strength  for its bank subsidiaries. All have modest double leverage. Should any of the holding companies become under-capitalized or have cash flow  coverage of less than 18 months to meet obligations, there is the potential that  Fitch could notch the holding company IDR and VR from the ratings of the  operating companies.  Brown Brothers does not have a holding company structure. KEY RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES - SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANY RATING The IDRs and VRs of the trust banks' bank subsidiaries are core to each  company's business and therefore IDRs and VRs are equalized across the group. Ratings are primarily sensitive to any change in the VRs of the associated bank  subsidiaries.  Fitch would also note that the ratings of any foreign bank subsidiaries could  change (be downgraded) should there be a change in the foreign country ceiling  rating in a particular geography.

23,"   By Ashley Lau | NEW YORK, Sept 22  NEW YORK, Sept 22 Goldman Sachs Group Inc  has laid the groundwork to launch actively managed exchange-traded funds, becoming the latest Wall Street bank to set its sights on the fast-growing market.The company late on Friday sought permission from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to introduce what could be a series of active ETFs, according to the filing, which names an equity dividend ETF as its initial fund.Goldman separately filed late on Friday for regulatory approval to self-index, which would allow Goldman to launch funds based on their own proprietary indexes created in-house.""They're kind of covering all of their bases,"" giving the firm broad leeway to design and introduce a variety of ETF products, said Ben Johnson, a Chicago-based analyst with Morningstar.Goldman in July shifted a key executive to help grow its ETF product strategy, but otherwise has been largely quiet on its plans to expand into the ETF space. The company five years ago filed for permission to launch passive index-tracking ETFs, but never introduced any funds. Friday's filing was the first to mark its foray into the active ETF space. Goldman Sachs spokeswoman Andrea Raphael confirmed the filings, but declined to comment on them more specifically. ""We are excited"" about the July decision to name 19-year industry veteran Michael Crinieri to lead the ETF effort, she said.The initial fund named in the filing, the Goldman Sachs Equity Dividend Fund will primarily invest in dividend-paying U.S.-listed equities, according to the filing. WALL STREET BANKS WADE IN The Goldman filings come as some of Wall Street's biggest banks have begun wading into the exchange-traded funds market. JPMorgan Chase & Co in June launched its first ETF and already plans to bring more funds to market, while Wells Fargo & Co received regulatory permission in August to offer ETFs.The move is seen by some as a defensive play by banks with their own wealth management clients. The banks can use their own ETFs to hold onto assets of customers showing some willingness to abandon traditional mutual funds and move into the $1.9 trillion U.S. ETF market, which has more than doubled in the past five years.""You're increasingly seeing that cannibalization is less of a concern than the outright loss of those assets,"" Johnson said, pointing to one of the concerns of mutual fund providers that has kept some from offering their strategies in ETF form.Unlike the biggest ETF providers - BlackRock Inc, State Street Corp and Vanguard, who together account for about 70 percent of the market - banks are putting more emphasis on their existing active investing capabilities.The asset management businesses of Goldman, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo are already among the largest in the country, according to Thomson Reuters Lipper.

26,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, October 24 (Fitch) State Street Corporation's (STT) third quarter 2014  (3Q'14) earnings were, on balance, more of the same, according to Fitch Ratings.  Overall expense growth modestly outpaced revenue growth despite some continued  growth in servicing and management fees as well as a pick-up in foreign exchange  trading. These results equated to a return on average equity (ROE) of 10.6% in 3Q'14  compared to 11.9% in the sequential quarter and 10.8% from the year-ago quarter.  Fitch continues to note that while these results are satisfactory from a credit  perspective, they remain below the company's long-term averages and Fitch's  long-term cost of equity assumption for the company of approximately 12%. STT's asset servicing and asset management revenue continues to expand primarily  due to higher global equity markets and some new business wins, partially offset  by a stronger U.S. dollar. Additionally, due to higher foreign exchange (fx)  volatility, volumes and therefore fx revenue picked up during the quarter.  Nevertheless, lower securities lending revenue, particularly relative to the  sequential quarter, and lower processing revenue offset these increases. Additionally, the company's net interest revenue (NIR) growth remains  challenging amid the persistently low interest rate environment. STT's NIR grew  2% from the sequential quarter and 4% from the year-ago quarter due, in part, to  higher levels of earning assets.  However, the company's net interest margin (NIM) continued to decline to 1.06%  in 3Q'14, down from 1.12% in the sequential quarter and 1.27% in the year-ago  quarter. The NIM decline was due in part to lower reinvestment rates as well as  some mix shift in the securities portfolio in preparation for compliance with  Liquidity Coverage Rule (LCR) which will go into effect in January 2015.  Fitch believes that STT will be in compliance with the LCR when it goes into  effect next year. Given the challenging interest rate environment, expense management remains a  key lever management can pull to support the company's earnings. Expenses  increased by 2.3% relative to the sequential quarter, and increased 9.9%  relative to the year-ago quarter.  Fitch would expect management to continue to balance investing for future growth  and absorbing higher regulatory and compliance costs with continuing to realize  savings primarily from its Operations and Information Technology transformation  program. On balance, Fitch would not expect STT's earnings to meaningfully increase until  short-term interest rates rise. In Fitch's view STT remains very sensitive to  higher short-term interest rates. Over time, STT's balance sheet has expanded as the company has continued to  accumulate deposit balances as overall liquidity in the markets remains very  high. This growth has proportionally been invested in the securities portfolio  which remains highly rated, as well as some loans. To this end, STT has also  started a comparatively small leveraged loan portfolio, which as of 3Q'14,  amounts to $1.8 billion. To put in it context, though, the company's total  balance sheet amounts to nearly $275 billion. STT's capital position remains good. The company's estimated fully phased-in  Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio under the Advanced Approach was  11.8% at 3Q'14, and under the Standardized Approach was 10.1%. STT will be  subject to the lower ratio of these two approaches. STT is also subject to the final Enhanced Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR),  which at the holding company is estimated to be 5.7% at 3Q'14, above its 5.0%  required minimum and at the main banking subsidiary estimated to be 5.4% at  3Q'14, below the 6.0% required minimum. Fitch would expect STT to take actions  such that both ratios are above required minimums when the rule eventually goes  into effect.

31,"  * State Street unit WM announces move in memo to banks* Implements global regulator FSB's reform recommendations* Trading could become exchange-based: head of industry body   (Recasts with comment from industry body, more context)By Patrick GrahamLONDON, Nov 17 London's benchmark foreign exchange ""fixings"" will move to a five-minute calculation window, from one minute currently, as of 2200 GMT on Sunday, Dec. 14, the WM Company said in a memo sent to banks on Monday.The move by WM, a unit of State Street Corp, follows the levying of the first fines on banks in a row over alleged manipulation of foreign exchange markets and the fixings, used to set reference values for thousands of contracts worldwide.After a torrid week for the biggest and least regulated of the world's major financial markets, worth more than $5 trillion a day, the head of the industry body ACI Financial Markets also gave a nod towards the potential for moving more trading onto regulated exchanges.The widening of the window is the first clear sign that recommendations made in September by the global regulators of the Financial Stability Board for changes to the fixings are being implemented. Other proposals, agreed after consultations with banks, asset managers and other stakeholders, include changes to trading floors that will keep client orders to be executed at the fixing rate separate from spot trading desks.A number of senior bankers have told Reuters lenders are still looking at how to implement those proposals and that they may yet lead smaller banks to cease executing the fixing orders at the centre of the year-long row.The London or ""WM/Reuters"" fix relates to several exchange rates and is compiled using data on actual transactions from trading systems like those run by Thomson Reuters and  ICAP-owned EBS. The rates for the fixings, at the centre of a global investigation into alleged market manipulation that saw six major banks fined $4.3 billion last week, are calculated by WM.Thomson Reuters is the parent company of Reuters News, which is not involved in the process.The memo also said Thomson Reuters Matching trade and order data would be added into the calculation for the euro, yen, Swiss franc and rouble. VOICE OVER? A year into a wide-ranging probe into charges that banks routinely fleeced clients over currencies, industry observers and politicians were frustrated at last week's deal, which they said showed the affair will end just with fines rather than any reform of what they say is the Wild West of financial markets.Far from chastening the world's biggest currency trading firms, they say the multi-billion dollar fines levied by regulators on Wednesday are more likely to draw a line under the affair and gradually allow a return to business as usual.But there are signs of change. Marshall Bailey, the head of the ACI Financial Market Association, which groups currency traders and the senior officials at banks who run electronic trading, has been a firm opponent of any shift to greater regulation by putting trading on exchanges.""The ACI policy is that markets trade very effectively at the moment as they are, and have a number of potential avenues for successful trading of FX. One of them is on exchanges,"" he told Reuters on Monday.""This might be expanded in the coming years to make it more effective, and if clients see the benefits of it, they will migrate in that direction,"" he added, stressing that this was still not the body's ""preferred route"".

In interviews with Reuters this week, both attorneys said the SEC largely affirmed Murray's ruling, adding that they will fight to have the remaining charges overturned in a U.S. appeals court.""We were disappointed that with two members dissenting, the commission disregarded Chief Judge Murray's thoughtful analysis and ignored the great weight of the evidence in reversing on a single issue,"" said John Sylvia, an attorney with Mintz Levin who represents Hopkins.Mark Pearlstein of McDermott Will & Emery, who represents Flannery, also said the SEC committed ""legal errors.""

38,"  (Repeats for additional subscribers)By Ross Kerber and Hilary RussDec 18 A ""green"" bond market has taken root this year, with municipalities and corporations issuing new environmentally-focused bonds and money managers jumping in to buy them.But it's too soon to tell whether all the new activity - less than a sliver of the $91 trillion worldwide bond market - will send much new money to projects like efficient buildings and better water systems.Instead, the new bonds reflect the complexities of using finance to address issues like climate change. While the sale of notes termed green bonds tripled to $35 billion worldwide in 2014, many are bonds that might have been sold anyway without the label, and which trade at terms comparable to non-green bonds.Nor is it clear the new bonds are ""green"" in the environmental sense that investors may expect, and issuers face only voluntary standards so far.Participants say that to avoid the impression that green bonds are just a marketing ploy, they still need to show more corporate treasurers and investors the bonds can make it easier to fund projects, a corner they have not yet turned.""If people think this is just to raise the flag, it's not going to last long,"" said Christopher Flensborg, Head of Sustainable Products and Product Development for Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB, the Swedish bank that's the world's largest underwriter of green bonds.Still, the spike in new activity shows some success to date, with new issuers and new buyers. Green bonds used to come exclusively from AAA-rated organizations like the World Bank; the last year has seen rising issues of green bonds from municipal issuers as well as some from corporations that are rated junk. On the buy side, State Street Corp has filed a registration with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to run what could be the first green bond index fund. Also, since July Bank of America Corp, Standard & Poor's and Barclays MSCI each have launched new green bond indexes that may form the basis of future mutual funds and exchange traded funds.Corporate and municipal issuers started issuing bonds they labeled as ""green"" in earnest last year, when they realized that they could pull in some new buyers who wanted to invest environmentally.""We thought the worst thing that happens is we get more people interested in our bonds"" said Alan Westenskow, a Zions Bank vice president who works with municipal issuers. He advised the Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems on a $21 million offer this month to pay for systems to turn waste heat to electricity. The offering, made in several sections, pays a coupon ranging from 3 percent to 5 percent.Spanish clean energy company Abengoa Greenfield, a unit of Abengoa SA issued its first high-yield green bonds in September - a 500-million-euro issue in all. A representative said ""90 percent of our projects qualify as green projects, so why not issue a Green Bond?"" Still unclear is how much extra demand the green label creates. The Abengoa representative said the company didn't have information on the extra demand. A spokesman for Bank of America, which underwrote the Utah bonds, said executives there would not comment on demand.JUNK GREEN BONDS In August 2014, the first wave of corporate junk green bonds entered the mix, when an affiliate of Princeton, New Jersey, power producer NRG Energy Inc sold $500 million of senior notes to pay for the purchase of the Alta Wind Energy Center, a wind farm in California. Abengoa followed suit, bringing the green high yield market to $1 billion.Corporate issues now make up 14 of the 51 green bonds tracked in Bank of America's green bond index, and have driven down its average rating to AA2 from AAA, according to a BofA Merrill Lynch research report.At $1.98 billion, green muni bonds themselves are just a fraction the ""green"" market, possibly because many muni issues have traditionally backed environmental projects and find investors even without the green label. ""At the end of the day, a bond is still a bond whether it's dubbed as 'green' or not,"" Eva Rippeteau, associate director at Fitch Ratings, said in an emailed analysis sent after the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago came to market this week with a $300 million green bond, with a coupon ranging from 2 percent to 5 percent. ""In many cases, these bonds are funding the same projects that a regular bond would.""Orders for a recent $350 million green bond sale by Massachusetts exceeded $1 billion, like many other over-subscribed municipal offerings. One buyer, Charles Hill, portfolio manager of T. Rowe Price's $3.9 billion Summit Municipal Intermediate Fund, said he has never had client requests for green bonds specifically, but bought the Massachusetts bonds because he liked them for traditional criteria like their intermediate duration, and their 5 percent coupon, comparable to that of similar non-green bonds.GREEN CONSCIOUS To be sure, the entire movement isn't about labeling. A spokeswoman for NRG Energy said it used the term ""to be able to target an incremental universe of investors who are more green conscious and to differentiate ourselves from other issuers.""Steve Liberatore, a TIAA-CREF fund manager who oversees $6 billion in bond products that use social or environmental criteria to pick investments for clients concerned about the use of their money, said he skipped the NRG bond because the company also has natural gas operations. He aims to avoid fossil fuels.""What we're seeing is a shift in the ability of the investor to link up directly with the projects"" focused on sustainability, he said.Interested investors and issuers are willing to give it time to grow, and to improve their standards. The Climate Bonds Initiative, a London nonprofit that promotes investments to reduce carbon emissions, estimates 39 percent of green bonds sold since 2013 were issued without an independent review of how green they are. Many institutional buyers do have internal standards for what kinds of projects green bonds can back.Catherine Roy, Calvert Investments' chief investment officer for fixed income, said she expects no slowdown. ""There are still trillions of dollars of capital needed to address a wide range of global environmental challenges,"" Roy said.     (Reporting by Ross Kerber in Boston and Hilary Russ in New York.

41,"   By Ross Kerber and Hilary Russ  Dec 18 A ""green"" bond market has taken root this year, with municipalities and corporations issuing new environmentally-focused bonds and money managers jumping in to buy them.But it's too soon to tell whether all the new activity - less than a sliver of the $91 trillion worldwide bond market - will send much new money to projects like efficient buildings and better water systems.Instead, the new bonds reflect the complexities of using finance to address issues like climate change. While the sale of notes termed green bonds tripled to $35 billion worldwide in 2014, many are bonds that might have been sold anyway without the label, and which trade at terms comparable to non-green bonds.Nor is it clear the new bonds are ""green"" in the environmental sense that investors may expect, and issuers face only voluntary standards so far.Participants say that to avoid the impression that green bonds are just a marketing ploy, they still need to show more corporate treasurers and investors the bonds can make it easier to fund projects, a corner they have not yet turned.""If people think this is just to raise the flag, it's not going to last long,"" said Christopher Flensborg, Head of Sustainable Products and Product Development for Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB, the Swedish bank that's the world's largest underwriter of green bonds.Still, the spike in new activity shows some success to date, with new issuers and new buyers. Green bonds used to come exclusively from AAA-rated organizations like the World Bank; the last year has seen rising issues of green bonds from municipal issuers as well as some from corporations that are rated junk. On the buy side, State Street Corp has filed a registration with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to run what could be the first green bond index fund. Also, since July Bank of America Corp, Standard & Poor's and Barclays MSCI each have launched new green bond indexes that may form the basis of future mutual funds and exchange traded funds.Corporate and municipal issuers started issuing bonds they labeled as ""green"" in earnest last year, when they realized that they could pull in some new buyers who wanted to invest environmentally.""We thought the worst thing that happens is we get more people interested in our bonds"" said Alan Westenskow, a Zions Bank vice president who works with municipal issuers. He advised the Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems on a $21 million offer this month to pay for systems to turn waste heat to electricity. The offering, made in several sections, pays a coupon ranging from 3 percent to 5 percent.Spanish clean energy company Abengoa Greenfield, a unit of Abengoa SA issued its first high-yield green bonds in September - a 500-million-euro issue in all. A representative said ""90 percent of our projects qualify as green projects, so why not issue a Green Bond?""Still unclear is how much extra demand the green label creates. The Abengoa representative said the company didn't have information on the extra demand. A spokesman for Bank of America, which underwrote the Utah bonds, said executives there would not comment on demand.

42,"   By Ashley Lau | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Jan 5 Investors poured $102.8 billion in new money into BlackRock Inc's exchange-traded funds in 2014, setting a record in global flows for its iShares ETF business, the company said on Monday.The inflows into BlackRock accounted for 31 percent of the total $330.7 billion in new money added to the global ETF market in 2014 as investors flocked to the low-cost, index-tracking funds. Global ETF assets now stand at more than $2.7 trillion.In December, U.S.-listed exchange-traded funds and products alone surpassed $2 trillion in assets for the first time, according to research firm ETFGI. BlackRock, the largest U.S. ETF provider, followed by State Street Corp and Vanguard, has been a beneficiary of the growth. The bulk of BlackRock's ETF inflows in 2014 came from its U.S.-listed iShares funds, which added $82.8 billion in new money, doubling its 2013 net flows and also setting a record.Mark Wiedman, global head of iShares at BlackRock, said fixed-income was also a key driver of the company's global ETF flows in 2014, with $40.3 billion in new money added to its fixed-income ETFs alone. Fixed-income ETFs in October saw large inflows as investors moved their bond money into ETFs following Bill Gross's departure from Pimco in late September. The move shocked many investors, who in turn looked to broad, liquid ETFs as a place to park their assets. New York-based BlackRock, which now has more than $1 trillion in global ETF assets, has benefited from investors turning to ETFs as low-cost substitutes for traditional mutual funds or in some cases for new uses such as replacements for futures and swaps.The new global iShares ETF flow record in 2014 beats its previous annual record in 2008, when investors added $88.6 billion in new money into the funds.BlackRock is to report its fourth-quarter 2014 results on Jan 15.

45,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, January 26 (Fitch) On a stated basis, State Street Corporation's (STT)  fourth quarter 2014 (4Q14) earnings performance was down modestly relative to  both the sequential and year-ago quarters.  STT's return on average equity (ROE)  was 10.4% in 4Q14, down modestly from 10.6% in 3Q14), and down from 10.9% in  4Q13. On an operating basis, which excludes a few expenses related to litigation and  restructuring, to name a few, the company's ROE was 11.6% in 4Q14, up from 11.4%  in the sequential quarter, and 10.3% in the year-ago quarter.  While this  indicates the core franchise is performing satisfactorily, costs such as $50  million for litigation this quarter, and $42 million for restructuring costs,  are significant, and continue to weigh on overall results. STT's 4Q14 results were helped by improved market-based revenue including higher  foreign exchange trading and securities finance revenue.  On a stated basis,  total trading revenue was up 5.4% from the sequential quarter and 24.2% from the  year-ago quarter due to higher foreign exchange volatility over the course of  the last quarter.  In addition, securities finance revenue expanded 7.1% from  the sequential quarter and 39.5% from the year-ago quarter.  The improvement in  these businesses was also evident in the results of competitors as well. STT's asset servicing and management fee revenue were both down relative to the  sequential quarter, but up moderately relative to the year-ago quarter on a  stated basis.  The sequential comparisons were the result in large part of a  stronger U.S. dollar, which impacted foreign currency translation in STT's  results.   Nevertheless the company still had some good new business to help offset the  currency translation impact noted above.  Total assets under custody and  administration now amount to $28.19 trillion, down 1% from the sequential  quarter, and up 2.8% from the year-ago quarter.  Total assets under management  now amount to $2.45 trillion, up 1.1% from the sequential quarter and 4.4% from  the year-ago quarter.   Additionally, as expected, the company's net interest margin (NIM) continued to  modestly grind down to 1.04% in 4Q14.  Fitch would expect this to continue until  short-term interest rates rise at some point in the future. Expenses management continues to be an area of focus for STT's management.  Due  in large part to some of the non-core expenses noted above, STT did not achieve  positive operating leverage relative to either the sequential or year-ago  quarters.  Fitch would also note that compensation expenses were up as well as  processing fees, which had an impact on results. Fitch continues to consider STT's capital position to be good, particularly in  the context of its balance sheet composition.  STT's fully-phased in Basel III  Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio was 11.6% under the advanced approach, down  from 11.7% in the sequential quarter.  Under the fully phased-in standardized  approach, the company's Basel III CET1 ratio was 10% in 4Q14..  Fitch would note  that STT will be subject to the lower ratio of these two approaches. STT is also subject to the Enhanced Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR), which on  a fully phased-in basis at the holding company is estimated to be 5.2% at 4Q14,  above its 5% required minimum and estimated at the main banking subsidiary to be  4.8% at 4Q14, below the 6% required minimum.  Fitch would expect STT to take  actions - such as working to reduce client deposit levels - such that both  ratios are above required minimums when the rule eventually goes into effect.

Vanguard, which recently surpassed State Street to become the No. 2 U.S. ETF provider, has been winning assets with its razor-thin fees.With the new price reductions, State Street's SPDR Barclays Aggregate Bond ETF, for example, now has an expense ratio of 0.1 percent, down from 0.21 percent.

53,"   By Ashley Lau and Tim McLaughlin | BOSTON  BOSTON State Street, which sold the first exchange-traded fund in 1993, is falling flat in its bid to win back market share in the ETF industry by wooing advisers to retail investors, with many advisers saying the bank doesn't do enough to support them. State Street, which lost its long-time No. 2 spot among ETF providers in the first quarter to Vanguard Group, does less than its competitors in giving them the data, investment tools, and ideas they need to improve their wealth management practices, several advisers to the fast-growing retail ETF market said.""State Street is a notable laggard in adviser support,"" said Larry Glazer, a managing partner at Mayflower Advisors, which oversees $2 billion in State Street's hometown of Boston. ""Given State Street’s scale and first mover advantage as an ETF pioneer, they have abysmal adviser support. It's almost a laughing matter in the industry.""The assessment comes more than a year after State Street began a multi-year effort to bolster its adviser support organization and combat a widening loss in market share, by adding staff, poaching senior executives from rivals and trimming fees. The bank ranked fifth among ETF providers in how loyal advisers are to their brand, according to a survey last year of almost 1,500 advisers by Cogent Reports, a Cambridge, Massachusetts research firm.""I'm not surprised some of these things haven't caught up,"" said Jim Ross, the head the ETF business for State Street Global Advisors (SSgA), the asset management arm of the bank. ""It takes time to build.""The stakes are becoming clearer. Rival Vanguard's ETF assets had an organic growth rate of 26 percent in 2014, compared with State Street's 10 percent. Since 2011, State's Street's U.S. market share has dropped about 5 percentage points to 20 percent, while Vanguard has gained 6 percentage points to 21.8 percent.As a result, earlier this year and for the first time, Vanguard moved past State Street to No. 2 in total U.S. ETF assets with $478 billion, compared with State Street's $458 billion. BlackRock's iShares ETFs rank No. 1 with $1.1 trillion in assets globally. Financial advisers hold the key to penetrating the retail market because they are among the heaviest users of ETFs in constructing investment portfolios. ETF assets are projected to double to $5 trillion by 2020, according to a PwC survey. In 2013, SSgA decided to make a substantial investment to reinforce its adviser support organization. Since the beginning of 2014, for example, it hired 45 people to increase the size of its distribution organization to 138 employees, said Ross, who declined to give a specific figure for what State Street invested.SSgA also has launched 109 new ETFs since 2011, including one recently with DoubleLine's star bond manager Jeff Gundlach, and boosted efforts to produce more research to help advisers educate their clients about tax management, wealth transfer and raising financially independent children. To get on track with advisers, the bank poached a number of senior executives from rivals such as Morgan Stanley, UBS Wealth Management and BlackRock Inc. Its recent hire of Ronald O'Hanley, the former asset management chief at Fidelity Investments, underscores the importance of penetrating the retail market where advisers hold growing sway. State Street also slashed fees on 41 of its SPDR ETFs earlier this year, joining a years-long price war that has entrenched Vanguard and BlackRock.Despite being a pioneer in the ETFs, State Street is still best known as the world's No. 2 custody bank. It safeguards $28 trillion in assets, and that's where it gets most of its revenue and profit. In 2014, State Street's investment management unit, which includes ETFs, generated $1.3 billion in revenue, or about 13 percent of the company's total revenue. Custody and asset servicing generated nearly all of the rest.Ben Johnson, an analyst with Morningstar in Chicago, said State Street's challenge is cultural. For State Street, ""asset management is a secondary business,"" he said. ""They've been geared, they've been tooled, and they've been built to deal with institutional investors and not necessarily toward a more adviser audience.""Meredith Rice, senior director at Cogent, said advisers give State Street high marks for having a broad range of ETF products that are easily traded. ""The only thing with State Street has been their institutional focus,"" Rice said. ""Their rivals are more focused on retail.""    Reliance on institutional investors - hedge funds, pension funds, asset managers and Wall Street banks that are the bread and butter of State Street's custody business but who sometimes use ETFs for hedging and shorting markets - also has added a volatile dimension to State Street's ETF business. In January, for example, investors withdrew $28 billion from State Street’s big SPDR S&P 500 ETF, or 13 percent of assets, according to Lipper Inc data. By contrast, BlackRock's comparable iShares fund held about steady and Vanguard's S&P 500 ETF had net deposits of $1.5 billion. ""Honestly, I don't lose sleep anymore about the big swings in outflows in SPY,"" Ross said. ""There is not a competitor of mine in the ETF space who wouldn't want SPY in their business.""

54,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, April 24 (Fitch) State Street Corporation's (STT) first quarter 2015  earnings of $377 million were down relative to the sequential quarter due in  part to litigation accrual of $150 million due to issues surrounding foreign  exchange (FX) practices. These earnings equated to a 7.9% return on average  common equity, which according to Fitch Ratings, is below long-term  expectations. Relative to the year-ago quarter earnings increased by 6% due in large part to  higher revenue generated from FX trading amid higher FX volatility during the  quarter. Additionally the company's securities finance revenue improved relative  to the year-ago quarter, which helped offset the continued decline in net  interest revenue. As such, STT's fully tax equivalent net interest margin (NIM) declined to 1.06%  in 1Q15 down from 1.09% in the sequential quarter and 1.30% in the year-ago  quarter. Fitch would expect the NIM to continue to grind down -- at least until  short-term interest rates eventually rise. Expenses modestly increased relative to both the sequential and year-ago  quarters. Nevertheless Fitch continues to believe STT's focus on efficiency and  keeping expense growth lower than revenue growth generally remains intact. While STT's revenues may be slightly volatile depending on the performance of  market based revenue (FX trading and securities finance revenue), the growth in  expenses appears to be relatively inline with revenue growth in servicing fees  and management fees. Should market based remain strong, Fitch would expect STT  to begin to deliver some strong operating leverage on a go forward basis. This  should help boost the company's return on average common equity (ROE) to its  long-term averages and closer to Fitch estimate of STT's cost of equity  assumption of approximately 12%. STT's balance sheet modestly expanded in 1Q15 as the company continues to  accumulate deposits. This growth in deposits has generally been placed with  other banks or at the Federal Reserve. This quarter, however, STT modestly  increased its repurchase agreement portfolio to handle some of its excess  liquidity. While Fitch believes this deposit growth helps to keep STT's balance sheet very  liquid, it also has an adverse impact on the company's Enhanced Supplementary  Leverage Ratio (SLR), which on a fully phased-in basis is effective in January  2018. Due in part to the deposit growth, the fully phased-in SLR at the  operating company remained constant at 4.8%, currently below the 6% requirement  in 2018, and the SLR at the holding company declined to 4.9%, slightly below the  5.0% requirement in 2018. Fitch believes STT will continue to pursue avenues to move some client deposits  away from STT or its balance sheet in order to help the company reach compliance  with the SLR. In Fitch's view STT's capital position remains good, particularly given Fitch's  view of the comparatively low-risk nature of the balance sheet. As of 1Q15,  STT's fully phased-in Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio under the  advanced approaches was 11.5%, unchanged from the prior quarter, and under the  standardized approach was 9.9%, up one basis point from the prior quarter. Fitch  notes that the standardized approach will likely remain STT's binding constraint  ratio.

57,"   By Ashley Lau and Michael Flaherty | NEW YORK  NEW YORK May 13 The biggest providers of exchange-traded funds, which have been funneling billions of investor dollars into some little-traded corners of the bond market, are bolstering bank credit lines for cash to tap in the event of a market meltdown.Vanguard Group, Guggenheim Investments and First Trust are among U.S. fund companies that have lined up new bank guarantees or expanded ones they already had, recent company filings show.The measures come as the Federal Reserve and other U.S. regulators express concern about the ability of fund managers to withstand a wave of investor redemptions in the event of another financial crisis. They have pointed particularly to fixed-income ETFs, which tend to track less liquid markets such as high yield corporate bonds or bank loans.""You want to have measures in place in case there are high volumes of redemption so you can meet those redemptions without severely impacting the liquidity of the underlying securities,"" said Ryan Issakainen, exchange-traded fund strategist at First Trust. The company has increased a credit line it has set up to $80 million at the end of last year, the most recent reporting period, from what was originally a $20 million line in early 2013. The line is shared by two of its ETFs and two mutual funds with a combined $645 million in assets.Under the Wall Street reform act known as Dodd-Frank, banks have been shedding their bond inventories, resulting in less liquidity in fixed-income markets. Because there are fewer bonds available for trading, a huge selloff in the bond markets could worsen the effect of a liquidity mismatch in bond ETFs.Vanguard, the second-largest U.S. ETF provider, lined up its first committed bank line of credit last year and now has a $2.89 billion facility backed by multiple banks and accessible to all of Vanguard's funds, covering some $3 trillion in assets, the Pennsylvania-based fund company told Reuters. The new setup is to ""make sure that funds will be available in time of market stress when the banks themselves may have liquidity concerns,"" Vanguard said.The issue for ETFs is this: When investors sell fund shares and there aren't enough ETF buyers in the market, the ETF manager in many cases will need to immediately sell shares of the underlying securities in the fund to meet those redemptions. But a sudden selloff of an ETF in an illiquid market could cause the manager to have to dump those securities at any price, causing their share prices to collapse. With a line of credit, fund managers could instead meet redemptions and take their time to sell some securities. ""These funds offer daily or even intraday liquidity to investors while holding assets that are hard to sell immediately, thus making the funds vulnerable to liquidity risk,"" U.S. Federal Reserve Vice Chair Stanley Fischer said in a speech in March in Germany, pointing directly to ETFs and saying they have mushroomed in size while tracking indexes of ""relatively illiquid"" assets.That is all exacerbated because investors have been pouring money into bond ETFs, while banks, under regulatory pressure to limit their own holdings, have been slashing their bond inventories.Growth in fixed-income ETFs also means there are now more products tied to corners of the bond market previously untapped by ETFs. Assets in U.S.-listed fixed-income ETFs are up nearly six-fold since 2008, to $335.7 billion at the end of April, according to Thomson Reuters Lipper data. With overall fixed-income ETF growth has come expansion in some esoteric corners of the bond market. Assets in loan ETFs, for example, have grown almost five-fold over the past three years to $7 billion at the end of April. Many of these funds weren't in existence during financial crisis that shook global markets in 2008 and haven't been tested by a widespread run.BOLSTERING CREDIT LINES Like paying for insurance, maintaining these liquidity backstops comes at a cost.Banks facing their own reserve requirements against these lines are charging commitment fees that can range from 0.06 percent to 0.15 percent, according to company filings. If a line is actually drawn upon, there would be additional interest charged on any amount borrowed. In many cases, these costs are included in the ETF's annual expense ratio, and borne by the funds' investors. Borrowing costs vary from firm to firm, but they are typically charged interest at a rate equal to the higher of the federal funds rate or the adjusted London interbank offered rate plus an agreed upon spread.Most fund managers cite the expansion of their credit facilities as commensurate with the growth in assets of their funds. But they are also able to point to them as ways to head off regulator concerns at a time when asset managers have been the subject of increased scrutiny about whether or not they should be classified as ""systemically important financial institutions,"" a tag that would involve more regulation.Vanguard, for example, referenced its committed credit line in a letter to the Financial Stability Oversight Council in March, noting it was one of the measures it has in place for liquidity risk management.BlackRock Inc, the world's largest ETF manager, hasn't opened lines of credit for its bond funds because it doesn't trade in the less liquid corners of the bond market, but it has opened a line of credit against its some of its emerging market stock ETFs as ""a source of cash to be used to facilitate settlement requirements associated with trading in smaller markets,"" spokeswoman Melissa Garville said.State Street Corp, the third biggest ETF provider after BlackRock and Vanguard, and Invesco Ltd's  PowerShares, the fourth-biggest, have credit lines set up for their respective senior loan ETFs. For State Street, its senior loan ETF alone has exclusive access to $100 million of the total $300 million credit facility the fund company has in place.Other ETF firms that have expanded their credit lines include New York-based Guggenheim and Dallas-based Highland Capital. Highland increased its credit line six-fold to $150 million last October in part because of one big investor who ""wanted to get a little more comfort"" that the fund would be able to meet a potentially large redemption, said Ethan Powell, the firm's chief product strategist.""In order to accommodate that investor effectively, we upsized the size of the facility,"" Powell said. ""We don't anticipate drawing on it, but it really serves as more of a security blanket.""

67,"   By Ross Kerber and Dan Freed | BOSTON/NEW YORK, Sept 11  BOSTON/NEW YORK, Sept 11 Big mutual funds are likely to vote later this month to allow Bank of America Corp  Chief Executive Brian Moynihan to retain his chairman title, based on their voting history, governance experts said.That support could leave investors seeking to split the chairman and chief executive roles facing an uphill battle.The second-largest U.S. bank last year gave Moynihan the additional title of chairman, a move that upset many investors who prefer an independent chairman, who can provide more oversight.Portfolio managers signaled their displeasure by voting against four directors who were running for re-election at the company's annual meeting in May. The directors still received enough votes to retain their seats, but by relatively narrow margins. Recent securities filings show big funds run by the bank's top shareholders including Vanguard Group Inc, State Street Corp  and BlackRock Inc backed all directors at the Charlotte, North Carolina, company in May.These supportive votes suggest the asset managers will again vote the bank's way, if only to avoid controversy, said Yale Law School professor Jonathan Macey.""These guys don't like turmoil,"" Macey said. BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street representatives all declined to comment. A Bank of America spokesman declined to comment on ongoing talks with investors.Investors will vote on Sept. 22 on bylaw changes made last year to give Moynihan the additional job. That move undid a vote by shareholders in 2009 to require an independent chair. The bank also named Jack Bovender lead independent director. At the bank's annual meeting, investors focused their ire on governance committee members, including committee head Thomas May, supported by only 67 percent of votes cast.Support for directors of companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 on average has been 95 percent or better recently, said compensation consultant Semler Brossy.That big asset managers voted for the directors on the bank's governance committee suggests the investors were not so angry about Moynihan's new title, especially given the new role given to Bovender, said Stephen Brown, head of governance consulting firm the Edgerton Group.""What's fair to read from them (the votes) is that the big funds have a neutral position on what they think of the split role, as long as there is a strong lead independent director,"" Brown said.

68,"   By Jemima Kelly | LONDON  LONDON Nine of the world's biggest banks including Goldman Sachs and Barclays have joined forces with New York-based financial tech firm R3 to create a framework for using blockchain technology in the markets, the firm said on Tuesday. It is the first time banks have come together to work on a shared way in which the technology that underpins bitcoin - a controversial, web-based ""crytocurrency"" - can be used in finance.Over the past year, interest in blockchain technology has grown rapidly. It has already attracted significant investment from many major banks, which reckon it could save them money by making their operations faster, more efficient and more transparent.The new project, the result of more than a year's worth of consultations between R3, the banks and other members of the financial industry, will be led by R3 CEO David Rutter, formerly CEO of electronic trading at ICAP Electronic Trading, one of the world's largest interdealer brokers. ""We held several roundtables...to deeply consider what the possible implications of the blockchain were, and what it could possibly do to save money, and time, and to create a better paradigm for the world of Wall Street and finance,"" Rutter told Reuters on Tuesday. Those that have signed up to the initiative so far are JP Morgan, State Street, UBS, Royal Bank of Scotland, Credit Suisse, BBVA and Commonwealth Bank of Australia. The blockchain works as a huge, decentralized ledger of every bitcoin transaction ever made that is verified and shared by a global network of computers and therefore is virtually tamper-proof.

Two parties could use it to exchange any other information, within minutes and with no need for a third party to verify it.Rutter said the initial focus would be to agree on an underlying architecture, but it had not yet been decided whether that would be underpinned by bitcoin's blockchain or another one, such as one being built by Ethereum, which offers more features than the original bitcoin technology. Once that had been agreed on, Rutter said, the first use of the technology might be the issuance of commercial paper on the blockchain.  ""I think that these technologies will probably be post-trade,"" he said. ""I think savings are in the settlement side, in post-trade, in issuance, but not in exchange trading or OTC trading any time in the near future."" He added that R3 will soon announce a few more banks joining the project.

74,"  * Weaker rouble, low tax take boost Russian oils' earnings* Government sources estimate extra tax take at $3-$9 bln* Sanctions deter investors despite low stocks valuations* Graphic of Russian valuations: link.reuters.com/xyh55wBy Katya Golubkova, Zlata Garasyuta and Dmitry ZhdannikovMOSCOW, Sept 25 When the head of the Kremlin's oil major Rosneft, Igor Sechin, went to see Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev last month to report on his achievements, he proudly boasted about a bullish report from the U.S. investment bank Goldman Sachs.Goldman's analysts said they had spotted a buying opportunity in the Russian oil sector. While energy companies around the world had been hit hard by a global fall in prices, Russia's oil companies had been spared some of the damage thanks to a collapse in the rouble which lowered their costs.In fact, Goldman said, Russia's oil industry, the world's biggest by volume, was also its most profitable.A month later, investors don't yet seem to have heeded Goldman's advice to buy in. Most are still spooked away from Russia by international financial sanctions imposed by the United States and EU over the conflict in Ukraine.But the taxman has taken notice.""The Russian firms have generated 600 billion roubles ($9 billion) in extra revenues from rouble rate changes. They didn't earn this money, they are just benefiting from the devaluation. So they need to think how to optimise their spending,"" Russian finance minister Anton Siluanov said this week.Several government sources told Reuters the authorities were planning to seek additional taxes from oil companies next year, citing figures between $3 billion and $9 billion, to help plug Russia's widening deficit. An official decision has not yet been taken on the scale and shape of the new taxation. The sources said recent notes by investment bank analysts about the Russian oil industry - including the one from Goldman that was trumpeted by Sechin - were among the reasons they were now paying closer attention to the oil companies' bottom lines.""Oil firms are the main beneficiaries of the devaluation. They have made real money on it. And analysts have all confirmed it,"" one senior government source said.DEVALUATION The rouble has fallen in dollar terms about as fast as the price of oil, halving since the middle of last year. As the devaluation gathered pace, it gave a boost to Russian exporters. ""We expect the Russian majors to generate the highest free cash-flow yields globally, with Rosneft at the top,"" Goldman's analysts said in their report on Aug. 12.""We think current valuations offer an attractive entry point,"" Goldman said in the 23-page report, which didn't mention the word ""sanctions"" once.Two days later, Sechin crowed to Medvedev that the Goldman report was ""a serious signal for the market"".""They have appreciated our firm's ability to generate consistently high free cash flows... some $8 billion this year. This is the highest result among Russian and international companies,"" he said.Goldman was not the only bank to publish a bullish report.""Russia is cheap and has a tendency to overshoot. This creates excellent trading opportunities... even at oil prices of around $50 per barrel,"" Russia's biggest bank Sberbank said this month. Sechin said the good results were partially driven by his cost-cutting drive. But as Siluanov's comments made clear, the government sees the windfall mainly as an unearned result of currency moves.Russia's oil production has grown non-stop for 15 years despite predictions that its mature fields would soon be depleted, and output has continued to increase despite last year's sanctions.Still, the sector has serious problems.The Western sanctions included measures intended to hurt Russia's future oil production over the long term by limiting its access to technology. High profile exploration and development projects have been scaled back.Although they pay their workers in roubles, Russian oil companies also have costs in dollars, such as servicing their debt - especially Sechin's Rosneft, which paid $55 billion to buy BP's Russian oil joint venture before the oil price crash.So far, bullish analyst reports have not led to a rise in prices for Russian oil company shares, which have remained flat since Goldman blew the bugle to charge.A Reuters analysis of Russian oil firms' ownership changes over the past year shows that many major Western funds and asset managers, such as Fidelity, Allianz, Pimco, Credit Suisse, Baring, State Street, UBS - even Goldman Sachs' own asset managers - have liquidated or drastically cut back their holdings.Van Eck Associates in the United States, a rare investment manager to substantially increase holdings in Russian oil firms, said it had done in line with quarterly rebalancing of funds that track indexes, not out of an active investment decision.For Russian investment bank Renaissance Capital there has been little surprise that low valuations persist, given Russia's weakening economy and risks arising from sanctions.""We see no more value in the sector now than at the end of 2013 - before sanctions and the oil price fall,"" it said.

75,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, October 23 (Fitch) State Street Corporation's (STT) third quarter 2015  (3Q15) earnings were impacted by weaknesses in global markets which weighed on  the company's assets under custody and administration (AUCA) and assets under  management (AUM) levels, according to Fitch Ratings.   Overall return on average equity (ROAE) was 11.3% in 3Q15, up from 8.3% in the  sequential quarter which was marred by litigation accruals regarding indirect  foreign exchange (FX) matters, and up from 10.6% in the year-ago quarter. It is noteworthy that there are a couple of items impacting the overall ROAE in  3Q15 including a $47 million after tax charge related to a headcount reduction,  a $49 million after tax gain related to the sale of commercial real estate  acquired as a result of the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy, and a $59 million  reduction in an Italian deferred tax liability. On an operating basis (excluding the notable items above), STT's ROAE would have  been 10% in 3Q15, down from an operating ROAE of 12% in the sequential quarter,  and 11.4% in the year-ago quarter. As noted, the main driver of the lower earnings was pressure on asset valuations  as reflected in STT's AUCA and AUM levels. Given that fee revenue is calculated  as a percentage of AUCA and AUM, these lower asset levels directly impacted  revenues. In 3Q15, AUCA was $27.48 trillion, down 4.2% from the year-ago quarter and 4.8%  from the sequential quarter.  AUM was $2.38 trillion, down 9.1% from the  year-ago quarter, and down 7.2% from the sequential quarter.  This was due to a  mix of lower asset values and unfavorable foreign exchange translation given the  higher U.S. dollar. These lower asset levels translate to servicing revenue declining 0.6% from the  year-ago quarter and 2.3% from the sequential quarter as well as management fees  declining 9.2% from the year-ago quarter and 5.6% from the sequential quarter. Offsetting this was higher FX trading revenue relative to both the prior year  and sequential quarters.  Securities finance revenue was up relative to the  year-ago quarter, but seasonally down relative to the sequential quarter which  was higher due to the European dividend season. Net interest revenue (NIR) continued to decline, falling 10% relative to the  year-ago quarter and 4.1% relative to the sequential quarter.  STT's net  interest margin (NIM) on a fully taxable equivalent basis was 1.00%, but the  balance sheet did decline in size to $247 billion, down 16.1% from the  sequential quarter and 10% from the year-ago quarter. This balance sheet decline was primarily due to efforts by management to push  client deposits away from STT's balance sheet, in order to position STT for  compliance with the Enhanced Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR) as well as help  to better manage its G-SIB buffer calculation. As of the end of 3Q15, total deposits amounted to $186 billion, down 19.2% from  the sequential quarter and 10.4% from the year-ago quarter.   The company's fully phased-in SLR was 5.4% at the parent company, up from 5.1%  in the sequential quarter and also 5.4% at the bank level, up from 4.9% in the  prior quarter.  While STT is in compliance with the SLR at the parent company  (requirement is 5%), it is still below the 6% requirement at the bank level.  As  such, Fitch expects management to continue to push client deposits away from the  balance sheet. Given the challenging revenue environment noted above, STT is continue to take  steps to manage its expense base.  While total expenses were up only 3.7% from  the year-ago quarter and down 8.1% from the sequential quarter (which included  significant litigation expenses), the company's compensation and employee  benefits expense was up 10.3% relative to the year-ago quarter and 6.8% relative  to the sequential quarter. As such, management announced the aforementioned workforce reduction, which  includes a reduction of a net 200 positions and a re-location of 400 positions  to lower cost geographies.  Additionally, management also announced another  efficiency initiative designed to reduce expenses by $500 million annually. This will likely be down through continued use and implementation of technology  solutions as well as continued optimization of staffing levels. In Fitch's view, the company's fully phased-in Basel III Common Equity Tier 1  (CET1) ratios are good.  The estimated CET1 ratio under the advanced approaches  was 11.4% and under the standardized approach was 11.2%.  While the lower ratio  of the two will be STT's binding constraint, Fitch would note that the two  ratios are starting to converge.

79,"   By Trevor Hunnicutt | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Oct 30 A rule proposed by the U.S. Department of Labor that would set new standards for financial advisers serving retirement accounts could send $1 trillion in new assets to passive investment products, analysts at Morningstar Inc said Friday. The report said such a rule would have broad impacts on brokerage firms, index companies and asset managers if more money moved into digital investment platforms and by changing behavior by financial advisers.  That could be a boon for firms such as BlackRock, which manages index-based ETFs through its iShares brand, ETF provider State Street Corp. and MSCI, which builds indexes. But such a rule could have a ""mixed effect"" on other asset managers and distributors of financial products, Morningstar said.

80,"   By Michael Flaherty and Ross Kerber  NEW YORK/BOSTON Nov 6 Three top U.S. asset managers shied away from supporting dissident directors in recent proxy contests, according to voting data, showing how corporate management teams can still depend on key players in the fund industry for backing in the face of an activist fight.The data, dating back to 2013 and compiled by financial services group Houlihan Lokey, showed that since 2013, funds sponsored by BlackRock Inc, Vanguard Group Inc and State Street Corp all voted for just a minority of the 229 board seats sought by directors aligned with dissident shareholders.That was a low count considering that dissident efforts - often led by activist hedge funds - won 126 of the seats, or more than half of the contests. Funds sponsored by BlackRock supported 83 of the nominees, followed by funds sponsored by  State Street, which supported 62 of them, and Vanguard, which backed just 29 directors.The findings of the Houlihan Lokey report from these funds run counter to the hopes of activist investors that the fund industry will come around to supporting their attempts to remake corporate boardrooms.[reut.rs/1kbyTkm ] Despite the growing acceptance of activism among institutional investors, voting against the management teams of large companies where money managers hold big positions remains a difficult choice, potentially because it could risk the fund firms' contracts to manage company 401(k) money.""They've demonstrated that they're somewhat more conservative than the broader investment community,"" said Geoffrey Sorbello, senior vice president at Houlihan Lokey. ""They have large positions, they're very influential, and yet their voting record is often inconsistent with the eventual outcome of these situations."" The voting tallies exclude cases where mutual funds withheld support from management director candidates, which could in practice support dissident efforts.Also looming over the Houlihan Lokey data is the trend of faster settlements between companies and activists. In many cases, activist advisors say, the two sides settle because large institutional investors indicate to management that they are inclined to side with the activists. Vanguard Fund Treasurer Glenn Booraem, who oversees proxy voting, made a similar point. ""Increasingly, activists and companies alike are engaging with large institutional investors to gain support for their views and listen to their perspectives,"" Booraem said.Representatives for BlackRock and State Street Global Advisors declined to comment.The companies run huge passive funds required to own shares, and say they consider their proxy votes as long-term shareholders.

The state's main retirement system, called OPERS, says it is the 11th largest public pension in the country and at the end of 2014 had $91.2 billion in assets.The attorney for DeBaggis did not wish to comment.

98,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, January 28 (Fitch) State Street Corporation's (STT) fourth quarter 2015  earnings were satisfactory in Fitch Ratings' opinion. On a stated basis, STT's  return on average common equity (ROE) was 11.6% in 4Q15 up from 11.3% in the  sequential quarter and 9.45 in the year-ago quarter. These results were impacted  by an $81 million gain related to the final payoff from a commercial real estate  loan acquired as a result of the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy. As such, on an operating basis (which adjusts for the gain above as well as a  couple other items) STT's 4Q15 ROE was 10.5% up from 10% in the sequential  quarter but down from 11.6% in the year-ago quarter. Additionally, on a full  year operating basis, STT's 2015 ROE was 10.7%. This is generally in line with  Fitch's range of estimates for STT's cost of equity of between 10% to 12%. STT's total revenue was down 2% from the sequential quarter and 4.8% from the  year-ago quarter due largely to lower foreign exchange (FX) trading revenue as  well as lower net interest income (NII). STT's largest component of revenue,  servicing fees, were just down slightly relative to sequential and year-ago  comparisons. NII declined due to some balance sheet shrinkage, particularly compared to the  sequential quarter. In order to better comply with proposed Enhanced  Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR) requirements, STT successfully pushed a  number of deposit balances away from the company. This resulted in an 8.3%  sequential decline in total deposit balances. This dropped overall NII for the company, but the net interest margin (NIM) did  improve to 1.01% for 4Q15. STT's overall expenses on an operating basis declined 3% from the sequential  quarter and 3.2% from the year-ago quarter largely due to some decline in  compensation and benefits expense (STT's largest expense category) as well as  other expenses. It is noted that lower incentive accruals resulted in the lower  compensation and benefits expense. With respect to future expenses, STT is introducing a new efficiency initiative  labeled the Beacon program, which is a multi-year transformation program  targeting approximately $550 million in estimated annualized pre-tax savings  over the next five years. In order to achieve this, the company expects to incur  aggregate pre-tax restructuring charges of $300 million to $400 million over the  next five-year period. Given the still challenging interest rate environment as well as the competitive  nature of the business, Fitch believes efficiency initiatives remain a key lever  management can use to use to improve results to at least if not better than the  cost of equity assumptions detailed earlier. STT's assets under custody and administration (AUCA) amounted to $27.51 trillion  at the end of 4Q15, up 0.9% from the sequential quarter but down 2.4% from the  year-ago quarter amid challenging markets and currency translation impacts.  Similarly STT's total assets under management (AUM) were up 1.9% from the  sequential quarter but down 8.3% from the year-ago quarter.  Exchange traded fund (ETF) products continue to generate net inflows as they  steal share from traditional mutual fund products. Fitch expects this to  continue at least over a medium-term time horizon. Given the balance sheet shrinkage noted above, STT's capital ratios improved in  4Q15. The company's fully phased in Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio  under the standardized approach was 12% at 4Q15 and under the advanced approach  was 11.6%. In this case the advanced approach ratio would be the binding  constraint one for STT. STT's SLR also improved as of 4Q15 to 5.8% at the parent company, above the  proposed 5% requirement, and to 5.7% at the main bank subsidiary, below the  proposed 6% requirement. Fitch expects management to continue to take actions to  achieve necessary compliance with these ratios by the phase-in date of Jan. 1,  2018.

107,"   By Nate Raymond  U.S. prosecutors announced charges on Tuesday against two former State Street Corp executives for scheming to defraud six clients, including Irish and British government pension funds, through secret commissions on billions of dollars of trades.Ross McLellan, a former State Street executive vice president, was arrested on charges including securities fraud and wire fraud contained in an indictment filed in federal court in Boston, where the custody bank is based.The indictment also charged Edward Pennings, a former senior managing director at State Street who worked in the bank's London office.McLellan, 44, was arrested in Hingham, Massachusetts, where he lives. Pennings, 45, is believed to be living overseas and was not arrested, prosecutors said.Martin Weinberg, McLellan's lawyer, said in a statement that the evidence would show his client ""committed no criminal acts and had no criminal intent."" He called the case ""an over-reaction to past failures to control practices on Wall Street."" A lawyer for Pennings in a prior case did not respond to a request for comment.The case followed a 2014 settlement between State Street and the UK Financial Conduct Authority in which the bank paid a fine of £22.9 million (about $37.8 million) for charging the six clients ""substantial mark-ups"" on certain transitions.State Street said in a statement that it has been cooperating with the U.S. investigation, and has ""significantly strengthened"" the controls and reporting mechanisms within the U.K. business unit at issue. According to the indictment, McLellan, Pennings and others conspired from 2010 to 2011 to add secret commissions to fixed income and equity trades performed for the six clients of a unit of the bank.That unit helps institutional clients move their investments between asset managers or liquidate large investment portfolios, prosecutors said. ""With each trade, they chipped away at the savings of thousands of retirees whose pensions they were charged with safeguarding,"" Boston U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz said in a statement.The commissions came on top of fees the clients agreed to pay and despite written instructions to the bank's traders that the clients should not be charged trading commissions, prosecutors said.The clients affected included Irish and British government pension funds and a Middle Eastern sovereign wealth fund, the indictment said.McLellan and Pennings took steps to hide the commissions, prosecutors said.

117,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, April 27 (Fitch) State Street Corporation's (STT) first quarter 2016  (1Q16) earnings were impacted by a weaker global market environment, according  to Fitch Ratings. On a GAAP basis this dropped the company's return on average  equity (ROE) to 6.8% in 1Q16, down from 11.6% in the sequential quarter and 7.9%  in the year-ago quarter. This quarter's results included a $62 million net after  tax restructuring charge ($97 million pre-tax) related to the company's cost or  'Beacon' initiatives. On an operating basis, which adjusts for the charge above as well as some other  items, STT's 1Q16 ROE was 8.4%, down from 10.5% in the sequential quarter and  10.4% in the year-ago quarter. This is below Fitch's range of estimate for STT's  cost of equity of between 10% to 12%. This was due to lower servicing and  management fees as equity values were down globally, as well as higher  compensation expenses. Given the weaker quarterly results, expense management continues to be a key  focus for STT. The company's recently rolled out efficiency initiative, labeled  the Beacon program, should significantly aid in this effort. As noted above,  while some restructuring charges from Beacon were evident in this quarter's  results, Fitch believes STT may incur an additional $300 million of pre-tax  restructuring charges over the next 19 quarters. To the extent that longer-term this initiative permanently reduces STT's cost  base, it could help the company's returns to potentially exceed its cost of  equity. In 2016, the Beacon program is forecast to deliver $100 million of  annualized expense savings, inclusive of the company's headcount reduction  announced in October 2015. On an operating basis, in 1Q16 STT still produced negative operating leverage  relative to both the sequential and year-ago quarters. Relative to the  sequential quarter expenses were up 6.8% due primarily to higher compensation  expenses related to seasonal deferred incentive compensation expense. Compared  to the year-ago quarter, expenses were only up 0.1%, though there were higher  information systems and communication expenses. The revenue environment for STT remains challenging amid weaker global equity  markets, given the company's higher proportion of equity related business  segments On an operating basis revenues were down 0.5% from the sequential  quarter, and down 3.7% from the year ago quarter. Revenue performance in 1Q16  was also unfavorably impacted by the strong U.S. Dollar. Servicing and management fees also declined relative to the sequential and  year-ago quarters given weaker global equity conditions, as STT tends to have a  higher proportion of equity related servicing assets. This began to reverse  during the latter half of 1Q16 and into 2Q16 due to improvements in developed  markets, though emerging markets remain challenging. Market-based revenue was primarily higher. Foreign exchange (FX) revenue was up  relative to the sequential quarter on higher volumes due to some increased FX  volatility but down relative to the year-ago quarter. Similarly, securities  finance revenue also increased relative to both the sequential and year-ago  quarters. Despite these increases, market based revenue is proportionately much  smaller than the servicing and management fees noted above, so they couldn't  fully offset the declines. Net interest revenue (NIR) expanded by 5.1% relative to the sequential quarter  due in large part to the Federal Reserve's 25 basis point interest rate increase  last year. NIR was down 4.6% relative to the year-ago quarter due primarily to  fewer earning assets. Given the rate increase previously noted, the company's net interest margin  (NIM) on an operating basis increased to 1.12% in 1Q16, up from 1.01% in both  the sequential and year-ago quarters. Fitch continues to view STT's capital and liquidity positions as solid and  supportive of the company's ratings. STT's estimated fully phased-in Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio on a  standardized basis was 12% at 1Q16 and on an advanced approach basis was 11.9%.  Fitch continues to expect convergence between the standardized and advanced  approach CET1 ratios, but the lower of the two in any one quarter is STT's  binding constraint. More binding than the CET1 ratios noted above, however, is the enhanced  supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) for STT and its peer large processing banks.  As of 1Q16, STT's SLR at the holding company was 6%, 100 basis points above the  requirement, and at the main bank subsidiary was 6.2%, 20 basis points above the  requirement. Additionally, STT's balance sheet remains very liquid with client deposits  representing nearly 76% of total assets and with 93% of the company's investment  portfolio carrying either 'AAA' or 'AA' ratings. Two weeks ago the Federal Reserve and FDIC released their review of STT's July  2015 resolution plan submission and indicated it is not credible. Fitch expects  STT to address additional modeling and monitoring capabilities among others  concerns and to address all the deficiencies by Oct. 1, 2016.  Fitch does not view the lack of acceptance of STT's resolution plan by  regulators to be indicative of the company's current and ongoing financial  health. STT's ratings incorporate the expectation that it will satisfy the  regulators' requirements around its resolution planning.

127,"  HONG KONG, June 15 The Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) said on Wednesday it had reprimanded and fined State Street Global Advisors Asia Ltd (SSGA) HK$4 million ($515,477) for alleged failures relating to the investment firm's tracker fund.An SFC investigation found that from Dec. 1, 2008 to June 30, 2013, SSGA deposited the tracker fund's cash balances with its affliate State Street Bank and Trust Company's (SSBT), which offered zero interest on Hong Kong dollars even though the prevailing commercial interest rates were higher than this at the time. The SFC said SSGA had failed in its obligation to ensure the fund received interest in line with the market rate, and also found the company had poor procedures for handling the internal conflict of interest that led SSGA Asia to deposit the funds with its affiliate SSBT. SSGA also failed to fully disclose the situation in six interim and annual reports.  The SFC said that SSGA had fully cooperated with its investigation, and had agreed to review its controls, and had compensated the fund concerned.

129,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, July 12 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed State Street Corporation's  (STT) Long-Term Issuer-Default Ratings (IDR) at 'AA-'. The Rating Outlook  remains Stable. A full list of rating actions follows at the end of this  release. These rating actions were taken in conjunction with Fitch's U.S. trust and  processing bank peer review. A full list of rating actions is at the end of this  release. KEY RATING DRIVERS  IDRs, VRs AND SENIOR DEBT The affirmation of STT's ratings reflects its strong franchise in asset custody  and asset management, stable operating performance, and relatively conservative  overall balance sheet posture. Additionally, Fitch believes that management's  continued efforts to streamline the business via its Project Beacon will  continue to drive operational excellence and lead to more significant positive  operating leverage in a higher short-term interest rate environment. STT's high ratings continue to be supported by the company's strong business  model, which Fitch believes is characterized by high barriers to entry and  sticky customer relationships. STT's ratings are further enhanced by the  company's good funding profile, consisting mainly of institutional custody  deposits that Fitch considers to be core in nature. These factors offset the  comparatively weaker earnings performance for STT over the last several years. STT's -- as well as its peer trust and processing banks -- overall earnings  performance as measured by return on assets (ROA) and return on equity (ROE) has  been challenged amid the protracted low interest rate environment of the last  several years. STT's annualized ROE in the first quarter of 2016 (1Q16) was 6.8%, down from  9.8% in full-year 2015. Notably, 1Q16 included some charges, specifically  related to the company's Project Beacon efficiency program, but given the  recurring nature of these charges Fitch includes them in its ROE calculations.  Nevertheless these results are below STT's long-term averages as well as Fitch's  range of estimates for the company's cost of equity of between 10% - 12% over an  extended period. The main operating driver of the lower earnings performance continues to be the  low interest rate environment, which has compressed the company's net interest  margin (NIM) relative to historical periods. As of 1Q16, STT's NIM improved to  1.15% due in large part to the Federal Reserve's 25 basis point rate hike in  December 2015, though it continues to remain below historical averages. As such  the contribution of net interest income (NII) to total revenue was 21% in 1Q16,  lower than the company's 10-year averages. Given the slower than anticipated  pace of short-term interest rate increases so far this year, Fitch expects NII  to hover around this contribution amount in 2016. Despite the challenging interest rate environment, STT has demonstrated good fee  growth in both its world class asset custody and administration (AUCA) business  and its strong and growing asset management business. This will likely be  further boosted by the acquisition of General Electric's (GE) asset management  business.  STT's fee growth has also been supported by episodic improvements in foreign  exchange (FX) trading anytime FX volatility increases. However, at the same time  revenue from securities lending continues to be challenging amid low interest  rates and weak demand for securities. Fitch believes STT's management has done a good job of controlling expenses and  utilizing technology to drive efficiency and digitize its operations. However,  this expense management has largely been offset by higher compliance and  regulatory related expenses, which Fitch believes are likely to persist in 2016  as STT looks to remedy any deficiencies related to its resolution planning  process. However, at some point, Fitch believes STT has the potential to drive strong  positive operating leverage once compliance related costs begin to level-off and  should short-term rates begin to increase both more quickly and more  meaningfully. STT remains the most interest rate sensitive of its peer trust and  processing banks.  With meaningfully higher short-term interest rates, Fitch believes it is  possible that STT's pre-tax operating margin to rise higher than historical  levels of 30%. Fitch believes this could drive ROE to levels commensurate with  its cost of equity range of 10% - 12%, even with the higher levels of equity  that STT is now carrying relative to historical time periods.  Fitch believes that STT is appropriately capitalized, given the agency's view of  the company's relatively low-risk balance sheet. STT's combined  available-for-sale (AFS) and held-to-maturity (HTM) securities portfolio is  considered to be relatively low risk and highly liquid. The majority of the  portfolio is composed of U.S. agency securities, and consistently greater than  90% of the portfolio components carry a 'AAA' or 'AA' rating. STT's estimated common equity Tier I (CETI) under Basel III (Advanced Approach  Fully Phased-In) was 11.9% as of 1Q16 and under the standardized approach was  12.0% at 1Q16. The lower of these two ratios is binding, though Fitch notes  there has been convergence amongst these two ratios as under the advanced  approach operational risk-weight charges have continued to increase.  Additionally, Fitch would note that STT's Basel III CET1 capital ratios compare  favourably with both U.S. and international peers, particularly in the context  of the company's lower risk and highly liquid balance sheet as noted above. Fitch believes, however, that STT's binding constraint capital ratio is the  Enhanced Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR). Under the Advanced Approach on a  Fully Phased-In Pro-Forma basis, the SLR was 6.0% at the parent company and 6.2%  at the main operating bank as of 1Q16, both already above regulatory minimums.  In order to maintain SLR compliance as well as to reduce the recently finalized  Global Systemically Important Bank (GSIB) surcharge of 150 basis points, Fitch  expects STT to continue to aggressively manage non-operational deposits. To this  end, STT has begun charging clients fees to hold deposits on balance sheet in  some geographic locations as well as pushing excess client deposits away from  the balance sheet. SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANY  In May of 2015, Fitch upgraded the rating of STT's main operating bank, State  Street Bank & Trust (SSBT), to a Long-Term IDR of 'AA' from 'AA-'. The Outlooks  on the Long-Term IDRs are Stable. The upgrade of SSBT's rating to a notch above  the parent company's LT IDR reflects the expected implementation of total loss  absorbing capital (TLAC) requirements for U.S. Global Systemically Important  Banks (GSIBs). The Viability Ratings (VRs) remain equalized between STT and its material  operating subsidiaries, namely SSBT. The common VR of STT and its operating  companies reflects the correlated performance, or failure rate between STT and  these subsidiaries. SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR  Additionally in May of 2015 Fitch downgraded the support ratings of SSBT and  State Street Corporation (STT) to be in line with the agency's view of sovereign  support. The Support Ratings (SR) of '5' and Support Rating Floors (SRF) of 'No  Floor' reflect Fitch's view that senior creditors can no longer rely on  receiving full extraordinary support from the sovereign in the event that State  Street becomes non-viable.  In Fitch's view, implementation of the Dodd Frank Orderly Liquidation Authority  legislation is now sufficiently progressed to provide a framework for resolving  banks that is likely to require holding company senior creditors participating  in losses, if necessary, instead of or ahead of the company receiving sovereign  support. SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES Subordinated debt and other hybrid capital issued by STT and by various issuing  vehicles are all notched down from STT's or its bank subsidiaries' VRs in  accordance with Fitch's assessment of each instrument's respective  non-performance and relative loss severity risk profiles.  Subordinated debt is notched one notch down from the VR and preferred stock is  notched down five notches from the VR. Capital trust securities have been  notched down four notches from the VR. LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSITS With the upgrade of SSBT's Long-Term IDR in May of 2015, Fitch also upgraded  SSBT's Long-Term Deposit ratings to 'AA+. The upgrade of SSBT's deposit ratings  is based on the upgrade of their IDRs. Deposit ratings are one notch higher than  senior debt reflecting the deposits' superior recovery prospects in case of  default given depositor preference in the U.S. RATING SENSITIVITIES IDRs, VRs AND SENIOR DEBT Given that STT's ratings are already near the top of Fitch's global rated bank  universe, Fitch views limited potential for upwards ratings momentum.  Fitch believes that the main threat to STT's business model and ratings would  result from a large idiosyncratic technological or operational loss resulting in  reputational damage that causes clients to flee the firm. STT has been making  significant investments in its technology systems over the past several years,  which the agency believes helps to reduce potential idiosyncratic events that  are prone to cause large losses.  Fitch believes these operational risks have been well monitored and controlled,  but also acknowledges that they are inherently difficult to predict and  quantify. As such, a large occurrence such that it causes a revenue loss of 5%  or greater would likely prompt Fitch to review ratings to determine if a  negative rating action was appropriate. Additionally, should certain regulatory rules cause STT's management to  aggressively expand its currently small leveraged loan portfolio such that in  Fitch's opinion it alters the agency's view of STT's risk appetite this could,  over time, result in negative ratings pressure. Currently, Fitch does not expect the affirmative BREXIT vote to overly impact  STT's business; however, it may change the way that STT conducts business with  some of its foreign clients. Finally, Fitch also notes that STT and its peer trust and processing banks are  beginning to face risk of potential technological disruption to its business,  though this is likely over a very long-term time horizon.  Blockchain, or distributed ledger, is an electronic means of settling,  reconciling, and reporting on transactions, which is the core of STT and its  peer banks' businesses. While Fitch believes that it is highly probable that STT  and its peer trust and processing banks jointly work to harness this technology  to drive efficiencies across their respective platforms, it's also possible that  over a long period of time a technology company offers an alternative blockchain  solution that in Fitch's view could potentially disrupt the trust banks  business. At present, Fitch views this risk as well outside of the Rating  Outlook horizon. SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR Any upward revision to the SR and SRF would be contingent on a positive change  in the U.S.'s propensity to support its banks. While not impossible, Fitch views  this as highly unlikely. SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES STT's subordinated debt ratings are broadly sensitive to the same considerations  that might affect STT's VR. SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANIES  Given that SSBT's and STT's VRs remain equalized, SSBT's ratings are broadly  sensitive to the same considerations that might affect STT's VR. LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSITS The ratings of long- and short-term deposits issued by STT and its subsidiaries  are primarily sensitive to any change in the State Street's IDR. This means that  should a Long-Term IDR be downgraded, deposit ratings could be similarly  impacted. The rating actions are as follows:  Fitch has affirmed the following ratings: State Street Corporation --Long-Term IDR at 'AA-'; Outlook Stable; --Short-Term IDR at 'F1+'; --Support at '5'; --Support Rating Floor at 'NF'; --Viability rating at 'aa-'; --Junior subordinated debt at 'BBB+'; --Commercial paper at 'F1+'; --Preferred stock at 'BBB'; --Long-Term senior debt at 'AA-'; --Long-Term subordinated notes at 'A+'; State Street Bank and Trust Company  --Long-Term IDR at 'AA'; Outlook Stable; --Short-Term IDR at 'F1+'; --Support at '5'; --Support Rating Floor at 'NF'; --Viability rating at 'aa-'; --Short-Term deposits at 'F1+'; --Long-Term deposits at 'AA+'; --Long-Term subordinated at 'A+'.

Roger Burlingame, a lawyer for Pennings, said on Tuesday that his client voluntarily came to the United States to contest the charges and to clear his name.""He did not commit a crime and had absolutely no intent to do so,"" Burlingame said in an email.The arraignment followed Pennings' indictment in April with Ross McLellan, an ex-State Street executive vice president. State Street has faced several regulatory actions involving allegations of overcharging clients, most recently resulting in its July 26 announcement that it would pay $530 million to resolve several U.S. regulatory matters and lawsuits.State Street in 2014 reached a related settlement with the UK Financial Conduct Authority. It paid a fine of 22.9 million pounds, or $38 million at the time, for charging ""substantial mark-ups"" to six clients, including Irish and British government pension funds, on certain transactions.Prosecutors said that from 2010 to 2011, McLellan, Pennings and others conspired to add secret commissions to fixed income and equity trades performed for the six clients. Prosecutors said the clients were using a State Street unit that helps institutional customers move their investments between asset managers or liquidate large investment portfolios.The commissions, which McLellan and Pennings took steps to hide, came on top of fees the clients agreed to pay despite written instructions to the bank's traders that they should not have to do so, prosecutors said.McLellan, a Massachusetts resident, pleaded not guilty in April. Both men are scheduled to face trial in October 2017. The case is U.S. v.

144,"   By Patrick Graham | LONDON  LONDON ICAP-owned EBS Brokertec (IAP.L) said on Thursday it was on the verge of launching its ""Ultra"" data service, a high-speed feed that will further strengthen the hand of the large banks and computer-driven trading firms that dominate the currency world's biggest venues. The EBS Live Ultra service, priced identically to the company's existing EBS Live feeds and updating its snapshot of the market five times more regularly, will be launched ""imminently"", EBS Chief Strategy Officer Tim Cartledge said. The launch of the service, planned since the start of 2016, comes as some market participants raise questions over the cost and access to data feeds that banks and other players in the $5-trillion-a-day market use to power trading engines and other systems. Market participants say EBS Live costs $50,000 a month. Another trading venue, State Street-owned Currenex, is set formally to launch its NOW market data product shortly. Reuters News' owner Thomson Reuters (TRI.TO) competes with EBS and Currenex in the provision of foreign exchange trading infrastructure and services.  ""The novel thing about EBS Live Ultra is that it places an obligation on the most sophisticated consumers of the data to help create data for the good of the wider market,"" Cartledge said.  ""Access to the fastest data requires an obligation to help benefit all participants, rather than limiting access to it to those with the deepest pockets. We are offering a new 20 millisecond market data feed but we are not asking clients to pay any more for it."" Currency market managers say that developments in the data feeds are linked in part to the broader reordering of the market's eco-system over the past five years in favor of a new generation of high-speed traders who use complex algorithms to churn out orders and arbitrage between platforms. That has helped squeeze many smaller banks out of the top tier of trading and the sort of market-making activity where they hold currency orders on their own books in aid of making more profit through trading.

147,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) PARIS, September 29 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has downgraded State Street Flexible  Asset Allocation Plus Fund's Fund Quality Rating to 'Good' from 'Strong'. The  fund is managed by State Street Global Advisors (SSGA). KEY RATING DRIVERS The downgrade reflects difficulties experienced by the fund in time asset  allocation adjustments and portfolio construction decisions, leading to  disappointing performance in 2015 and so far in 2016 relative to its objective  and peers. The fund's proprietary MRI (market regime indicator) efficiently  identifies changes in risk regimes driving broad asset allocation bands but  implementation windows and tactical asset allocation decisions prove challenging  at times of volatile market conditions. Allocation bands have been updated  recently to allow more judgmental flexibility. The fund rating was placed 'Under Review' in January 2016 to determine whether  the recent underperformance reflected a temporary setback or a more structural  deterioration in the ability of the investment process to navigate through the  cycle and ultimately deliver on its ambitious performance objective to  outperform cash by 4%.  Fund Presentation State Street Flexible Asset Allocation Plus Fund is a sub-fund of SSGA  Luxembourg SICAV with EUR73m of assets at end-August 2016. The fund is  long-only, and invests globally in all major asset classes. It aims to  outperform Euribor 1-month by at least 4% over five years (annualised), with  controlled volatility (not exceeding 12%), while minimising drawdowns (maximum  drawdown of 10%) in volatile markets. It has been managed under the current  investment approach since December 2012. Prior to May 2015, the fund was a  France-domiciled SICAV.  Investment Process A key input in the portfolio construction is the MRI, a proprietary macro  indicator developed in 2001. It systematically identifies prevailing market  regimes and trends on the basis of investors' risk aversion across multiple  markets and regions. In Fitch's view, the MRI approach fosters efficiency and  discipline in the investment process. Portfolio construction is disciplined, and follows a predefined asset allocation  mix corresponding to prevailing market regimes, as defined by the MRI. These  were recently reviewed to allow more flexibility and leave more room to  judgmental views on sub-asset classes and geographical regions, which drive  tactical positions. The final portfolio is implemented through direct holdings,  funds, ETFs and listed derivatives, primarily futures. Enhancements of  option-based strategies are in the pipeline for more granular strategic timing  and more robust drawdown management. Resources The fund is managed by a Paris-based team of four, led by Frederic Dodard, with  19 years of experience and Head of EMEA Investment Solutions Group at SSGA.  Gregory Taieb is the fund's lead portfolio manager. The team is supported by a  well-staffed research team. SSGA's investment resources are solid, including a  global trading desk and an investment risk team. The fund benefits from SSGA's operational and risk control framework. The IT  environment is built around a combination of third-party and proprietary  systems, supporting well-controlled workflows.  Track Record The fund returned minus 1% in 2016 to end-August (I share class),  underperforming its reference index and Lipper peer group category. This was  primarily due to untimely portfolio de-risking in January, February and June  2016, as reallocation decisions are typically implemented over a two-week  period. The July market rebound was, however, better captured. The fund's  three-year performance is above peers but lagging behind the cash + 4%  objective. Fund Manager SSGA is the investment management arm of State Street Corporation  (AA-/Stable/F1+). It is a global asset manager with USD2.3trn in assets under  management as of mid-2016, including USD2bn in in absolute return/flexible  strategies. It employs more than 2,500 staff globally. RATING SENSITIVITIES The rating may be sensitive to material changes in the investment or operational  processes, or in resources dedicated to the fund. A material adverse deviation  from Fitch's guidelines for any key rating drivers could result in a downgrade  of the rating. For example, this may be manifested in significant structural  deterioration in the fund's performance or an excessive deviation from risk  objectives. Key person risk is limited for this fund, but model risk exists.

150,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, October 26 (Fitch) State Street Corporation's (STT) third quarter 2016  (3Q16) earnings were satisfactory, and adversely impacted by the closing of the  company's acquisition of General Electric's asset management (GEAM) business,  according to Fitch Ratings. STT's overall return on average equity (ROE) was 10.6% in 3Q16, down 12.4% in  the sequential quarter and down from 11.3% in the year-ago quarter. The decline  was due to higher costs associated with the closing of the GEAM transaction  noted above. STT's overall revenue was up 1.8% relative to the sequential quarter and  essentially flat from the year ago quarter. Despite $65 million of incremental  fee revenue from the GEAM transaction, overall fee revenue was up only 1.3%  relative to the sequential quarter, and down 1.1% from the year-ago quarter.  The year-over-year decline was due to lower trading revenue, including lower  foreign exchange (fx) trading revenue relative to the prior year period. Higher  asset management fees largely due to the closing GEAM transaction were offset by  lower fx trading revenue and lower securities finance revenue relative to the  sequential quarter, which was particularly strong for fx trading given the  market volatility surrounding the BREXIT vote. Higher net interest revenue (NIR) offset some of the comparatively lower serving  fee revenue and declines in fx trading and securities finance revenue. NIR was  up 3.1% sequentially and 4.7% year-over-year. This was due to continued deposit  growth as well as a modestly higher net interest margin relative to the year-ago  period. Total deposits grew 2.9% sequentially and 6.7% year-over-year, despite  management's continued efforts at optimizing its overall deposit base in light  of Enhanced Supplementary Leverage Ratio (ESLR) requirements. STT's NIM on a fully taxable equivalent basis was 1.14% at 3Q16, unchanged from  the sequential quarter, but up 14 basis points from the year-ago quarter.  Sequentially the higher deposit growth was offset by lower yields on residential  mortgage backed securities given higher levels of mortgage pre-payments during  the quarter. On a year-over-year basis, NIM benefited from the Federal Reserve's  rate hike late last year. Overall expenses on a stated basis were up 6.7% sequentially, and 1.1%  year-over-year. 3Q16 expenses included $57 million of run-rate expenses related  to GEAM and $29 million of one-time acquisition related costs related to this  transaction. Additionally, STT incurred a modest $10 million restructuring  charge in 3Q16 related to its cost savings initiative, Project Beacon. Taken together, on a stated (or GAAP) basis and therefore inclusive of all costs  related to GEAM, STT did not achieve positive operating leverage in 3Q16  relative to the prior or year-ago quarter. However, STT remains focused on  Project Beacon, which over the life of the program is expected to achieve $550  million of expense savings by the end of 2020.  In 2016, Beacon is estimated to generate $165 million in expense savings, and in  2017 it is expected to generate an additional $125 million of savings. This has  the potential to create positive operating leverage in the future to the extent  that it continues to digitize more and more of STT's back and middle office  operations.  Given the muted revenue growth noted previously, this initiative remains a key  lever management can use to at least maintain, if not improve, overall earnings  on a go-forward basis. STT continues to maintain a very liquid balance sheet. The $99.8 billion  investment portfolio represents 38.9% of total assets, with 92.5% of its bonds  rated 'AAA'/'AA' and a modest duration of 2.1 years. In addition to the  investment portfolio, STT has cash on balance sheet which amounted to $82.5  billion at 3Q16, or 32.2% of total assets. Given the large cash component of the balance sheet as well as the modest  duration of the investment portfolio, STT remains very asset sensitive. At the  same time, the company estimates that a 100 basis point upwards shock to  interest rates would cause a mark-to-market loss of $0.8 billion, or .80%  impact, to the investment portfolio. Fitch considers this manageable. STT's estimated fully phased-in Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio on a  standardized basis was 12.0% at 3Q16 up from 11.5% at 2Q16 and on an advanced  approach basis was 11.8% in 3Q16 up from 11.6% in 2Q16. Fitch continues to  expect convergence between the standardized and advanced approach CET1 ratios,  but the lower of the two in any one quarter is STT's binding constraint. More binding than the CET1 ratios noted above, however, is the ESLR for STT and  its peer large processing banks. As of 3Q16, STT's SLR at the holding company  was 6.0%, 100 basis points above the requirement, and at the main bank  subsidiary was 6.3%, 30 basis points above the requirement.

The manner of Fitch's  factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains  will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the  requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is  offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of  relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its  advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as  audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports,  engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties,  the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources  with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the  issuer, and a variety of other factors.

152,"   By Nichola Saminather | SINGAPORE  SINGAPORE Asian bond investors must brace for more volatility at least through the first quarter of 2017 when they are likely get more clarity on whether U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's policies will reflect his anti-globalisation campaign rhetoric, according to State Street Global Advisors. ""If Trump walks the talk, that can be pretty shocking,"" Ng Kheng Siang, head of Asia Pacific fixed income, said at the Reuters Global Investment Outlook Summit. ""There are some people who say don't believe everything he says, don't take him literally. But you have to take him somewhat seriously.""Indonesia and Malaysia, which have seen some of the biggest capital outflows following Trump's election victory, could continue to sell offFears that Trump's surprise election win could hit trade-dependent countries have caused a sell-off in emerging market assets across the globe. Trump promised during his campaign to impose trade tariffs on China, renegotiate several trade agreements and scrap the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement. ""Exports have been slowing down for a lot of Asian countries,"" Ng, who helps manage $4.1 billion of fixed income assets, said. ""With TPPA, you have some gains, some losses there, but hopefully it would create more trade volume. That has been taken away. ""With the TPPA gone, you have a negative trade impact. It's a setback for quite a number of countries - Japan, Malaysia, Singapore. While many of these countries' domestic demand is slowing down, they're looking for new growth ... the TPPA dashed that hope.""These countries may now need to look to trade agreements within Asia, he said.  STRONGER DOLLAR Expectations of faster growth and inflation in the United States due to Trump's promised fiscal stimulus also propelled the dollar to a 13-1/2-year high against a basket of six major global peers on Friday. The expected pick-up in inflation, rate increases from the Federal Reserve and the resulting strength in the dollar could see continued outflows from Asian markets, Ng said.  The countries to watch will be those that face pressures from their current account positions and fiscal deficits, and those with high foreign ownership in the local assets market, Ng said. Thus, it was no surprise that Malaysia and Indonesia, with as much as 50-percent foreign ownership in markets, were among the hardest hit, he said. ""That can attract more significant outflows,"" he said. ""The kneejerk reaction needs to be handled very carefully.""Malaysia and Indonesia's exposure means that these markets remain vulnerable to further outflows if the dollar strengthens further, he said.  ""With dollar strength coming on that strong, it means that central banks don't have lot of room to cut rates,"" Ng said. ""If the monetary policy lever becomes less of the thing you can work on, you need to lean more on fiscal. It depends on whether you have the fiscal capacity to do that."" Indonesia is in a better position to use fiscal measures to boost the economy than Malaysia, where Prime Minister Najib Razak may call snap elections next year, Ng said. ""In Malaysia, knowing an election may be coming, there's also some expectation of expansionary fiscal policy. Potentially that can help to provide some short-term cushion. But again, they're cautious that if they overspend, that may attract negative comments from rating agencies,"" he said. Even if the Trump risks recede, other events, including Britain's exit from the European Union and the fallout from an Italian constitutional referendum in December, could take their place, Ng said.
