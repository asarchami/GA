0,"   By Chikafumi Hodo | TOKYO, March 11  TOKYO, March 11 The head of New York-based Principal Global Investors said on Tuesday the $311 billion fund manager is looking into buying boutique asset management firms that invest in emerging markets and real estate to expand its portfolio of assetsPGI's chief executive, Jim McCaughan, said his firm, the asset management arm of Iowa-based financial services company Principal Financial Group Inc, hopes to finalise an acquisition, possibly in real estate, by the end of the year. He didn't identify potential targets.""It's hard to say, but I would be a little disappointed if we don't close at least one during the remainder of this year,"" McCaughan told Reuters in an interview. McCaughan is in Japan to meet clients.McCaughan said PGI, which bills itself as the 19th-largest pension manager in the United States, attaches more importance to doing the right deals than forcing the pace. PGI wants to acquire boutique fund management firms that invest in Europe and Asia as it already has strong presence in the United States, he said. A new acquisition would follow last year's purchase of London-based Liongate Capital Management, a hedge fund of funds  with assets of $1 billion. Boosted by inflows from equities, fixed income and real estate as well as the Liongate purchase, assets under management at PGI grew 10 percent last year.Emerging markets remain a focus for PGI, McCaughan said. While they may have appeared to look less attractive based on their performance over the past year, they continue to provide a strong long-term investment theme as middle-class populations grow in countries around the world, he said. ""We are actively looking not only at emerging, but at so-called 'frontier' markets, the smaller and newer markets. So that would be a second broader area and that would be fixed income or equities,"" he said.Currently, four asset management companies within the PGI group invest in fixed income or equities in emerging markets, with about $20 billion in assets in total. With regard to Japan, McCaughan said PGI is happy with its business in the world's third-largest economy, despite losing a mandate to manage foreign equities from the $1.26 trillion Government Pension Investment Fund (GPIF) last year.PGI has garnered more than 1 trillion yen ($10 billion) in assets over the last five years in Japan as institutional investors seek to diversify into foreign assets, such as U.S. high-yield bonds and international real estate investment trusts, he said.The firm also saw strong demand in international equities management from Japanese institutional investors in 2013, McCaughan said.",2014-03-11,PFG,"Tue Mar 11, 2014 | 3:38am EDT",Principal Global Investors CEO says firm seeking to acquire boutique asset managers,http://www.reuters.com//article/principal-finl-japan-idUSL3N0M71AF20140311?type=companyNews

3,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, June 12 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Principal Financial Group,  Inc.'s (PFG) long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A'. Fitch has also  affirmed the 'AA-' Insurer Financial Strength (IFS) ratings of PFG's U.S.  operating subsidiaries. The Rating Outlook has been revised to Stable from  Negative.  Fitch has also affirmed and withdrawn the ratings of PFG's funding  agreement-backed notes issuance programs, as the ratings are no longer  considered by Fitch to be relevant to the agency's coverage. A full list of  rating actions is shown below. KEY RATING DRIVERS The ratings affirmation reflects PFG's strong capitalization and stable,  balanced operating profitability, partially offset by increased financial  leverage and above-average exposure to direct mortgages and structured mortgage  securities. The revision in the company's Rating Outlook to Stable from Negative primarily  reflects diminishing concerns related to execution risk associated with PFG's  integration of AFP Cuprum S.A. (Cuprum), which it acquired in February 2013. To  date, the acquisition has exceeded expectations in terms of its contribution to  overall operating profitability. The revision in the Rating Outlook also  reflects a gradual decline in PFG's financial leverage. PFG's financial leverage was approximately 22.6% at March 31, 2014, down from a  recent high of 24.2% at Dec. 31, 2012 as the company issued debt to help fund  its acquisition of Cuprum. In the first quarter of 2014 (1Q'14), the company  redeemed the $100 million of surplus notes issued by Principal Life Insurance  Company (PLIC). As PLIC no longer has publicly-held debt outstanding, Fitch has  withdrawn the IDR of the company. In 1Q'14, PFG reported pre-tax operating earnings of $411 million, up from $304  million in 1Q'13. For the full year 2013, the company reported pre-tax operating  earnings of $1.4 billion, up from $1 billion in 2012. In addition to the  earnings contribution from Cuprum, the recent improvement in operating earnings  has been driven by higher fee-based revenue from growing account values and  tight expense management.  As a result of improving earnings, fixed charge coverage increased to  approximately 8.5x in 2013 from approximately 6.8x in 2012. In 1Q'14, fixed  charge coverage was 10.0x. While Fitch expects PFG to continue to generate  solid, stable earnings on its growing fee-based businesses, low market interest  rates, continued competitive pressures and less robust capital market conditions  are likely to restrain earnings growth in the intermediate term. PFG's strong capitalization is supported by the organization's primary insurance  operating company, PLIC, which reported a risk-based capital ratio (RBC) of 438%  at Dec. 31, 2013, up from 415% at year-end 2012. The company targets RBC in a  range of 415% to 425%, and Fitch expects the company to finish 2014 in that  range. Fitch considers PFG's allocation to direct mortgages to be above average  relative to the life insurance sector as a whole. In addition to $10.3 billion  in direct commercial loans and $1.2 billion in residential loans, the company  reported $4.1 billion in CMBS holdings at March 31, 2014. Although there has  been some recovery in these asset classes within the industry, Fitch views this  level of exposure to be a credit negative.  PFG, headquartered in Des Moines, IA, markets a range of retirement savings,  investment and insurance products and services primarily in the small- to  medium-sized business segment. The company reported consolidated assets of $211  billion, and total shareholders' equity of $10.1 billion at March 31, 2014. RATING SENSITIVITIES The key rating triggers that could result in an upgrade include: --Improved diversification of the company's sources of revenue and earnings; --Sustainable return on equity of 12% or higher and fixed-charge coverage above  12x; --Low volatility in earnings and capital over an extended period of time; --Financial leverage below 20%; --Reported RBC ratio above 475%. The key rating triggers that could result in a downgrade include: --Run-rate return on equity below 10% and a GAAP-based fixed-charge coverage  ratio below 7x; --A decline in the company's reported RBC ratio to a level below 375%; --Increase in financial leverage to a level above 25% debt-to-total capital.

7,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, April 13 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Principal Financial Group,  Inc.'s (PFG) long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A'. Fitch has also  affirmed the 'AA-' Insurer Financial Strength (IFS) ratings of PFG's U.S.  operating subsidiaries. The Rating Outlook is Stable. KEY RATING DRIVERS Today's ratings affirmations reflect PFG's strong capitalization and stable,  balanced operating profitability, partially offset by above-average exposure to  direct mortgages and structured mortgage securities. PFG's financial leverage was 22% at Dec. 31, 2014, down from a recent high of  24.2% at Dec. 31, 2012 as the company issued debt to help fund its acquisition  of Administradora de Fondos de Pensiones Cuprum S.A. (Cuprum), a leading pension  manager in Chile. For full-year 2014, PFG reported pre-tax operating earnings of $1.7 billion,  continuing a gradual improvement from $1.4 million in 2013 and $1 billion in  2012. In addition to the earnings contribution from Cuprum, the recent  improvement in operating earnings has been driven by higher fee-based revenue  from growing account values and tight expense management. Fitch notes that the  company's operating performance exhibited significantly more stability relative  to many of its industry peers during the financial crisis. As a result of improving earnings, fixed charge coverage (FCC) increased to  approximately 10.4x in 2014 from approximately 8.5x in 2013 and 6.8x in 2012.

8,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, May 05 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A-' rating to Principal  Financial Group, Inc.'s (PFG) issuance of approximately $400 million of 10-year  senior unsecured notes. Fitch has also assigned a 'BBB' rating to PFG's issuance  of approximately $400 million of 40-year junior subordinated debentures. PFG's  Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) is unaffected by this rating action. KEY RATING DRIVERS The notes are guaranteed by Principal Financial Services, Inc., PFG's  intermediate holding company, whose Long-term IDR is currently 'A'. Fitch  affirmed the ratings of PFG and its insurance operating subsidiaries with a  Stable Outlook on April 13, 2015. Approximately $550 million of the proceeds from the issuance are expected to be  used to redeem PFG's series A non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock and  series B non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, with the remainder expected  to be used for general corporate purposes. PFG's ratings are supported by the company's strong competitive position in  several key markets and product lines, strong capitalization, and stable and  balanced earnings profile, partially offset by above-average exposure to direct  mortgages and structured mortgage securities. The company's recent operating  performance has been strong. Fitch expects PFG's financial leverage to increase on a pro forma basis to  approximately 27% from 21% at March 31, 2015, as a result of newly issued debt  and the pending redemption of the preferred stock. Whereas the existing  preferred stock receives full equity credit in accordance with Fitch's rating  criteria, the newly issued subordinated debt receives no equity credit. The  increase in financial leverage exceeds Fitch's rating tolerance of 25%. Fitch  expects financial leverage to decline to approximately 25% within the next 12  months. RATING SENSITIVITIES The key rating triggers that could result in an upgrade include: --Improved diversification of the company's sources of revenue and earnings; --Sustainable return on equity of 12% or higher and fixed-charge coverage above  12x; --Low volatility in earnings and capital over an extended period of time; --Financial leverage below 20%; --Reported RBC ratio above 475%.

16,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, October 27 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Principal Financial  Group, Inc.'s (PFG) long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A'. Fitch has also  affirmed the 'AA-' Insurer Financial Strength (IFS) ratings of PFG's U.S.  operating subsidiaries. The Rating Outlook is Stable.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Today's rating affirmations reflect PFG's strong capitalization and stable,  balanced operating profitability, partially offset by above-average exposure to  commercial real estate through direct mortgages, structured mortgage securities,  and direct real estate investments. PFG's strong capitalization is supported by the organization's primary insurance  operating company, PLIC, which reported a risk-based capital ratio (RBC) of 431%  at Dec. 31, 2015, up from 423% at Dec. 31, 2014. The company targets  consolidated RBC in a range of 415% to 425%. PFG's PRISM capital model score is  'Very Strong', which is within expectations for its current rating category. PFG's financial leverage was 27% at June 30, 2016, which is down from 29% at  year-end 2015 and above Fitch's expectation of 25%. The increase in financial  leverage was driven by a company debt issuance of $800 million in May 2015,  which was used to primarily refinance all of the company's outstanding preferred  stock. PFG's preferred stock had historically received full equity credit from  Fitch. While the company's financial leverage is currently above expectations  for its current rating category, Fitch expects leverage to return to  approximately 25% in the near term. Fitch expects the new fiduciary rules announced by the U.S. Department of Labor  (DOL) in April 2016 to have a relatively modest effect on PFG's overall sales  and profitability. While the rule will increase compliance costs for PFG and its  peers, Fitch believes PFG's diversification in terms of products, international  operations, and distribution will help mitigate the financial impact on the  broader organization.  PFG's ratings benefit from above-average historical earnings stability,  particularly in comparison to many of its peers during the financial crisis.  Fitch believes the company's earnings stability is due in part to PFG's business  mix, which is well diversified by product and geography. Over the last few  years, growth in fees from assets under management has been an offset to lower  investment income driven by persistently low interest rates. For the first half  of 2016, PFG reported pre-tax operating earnings of $788 million, down from $851  million for the same period in 2014. The decline in operating earnings was  driven primarily by weak first-quarter 2015 equity market performance.  Fitch considers PFG's allocation to direct mortgages to be above average  relative to the life insurance sector as a whole. In addition to $11.2 billion  in direct commercial loans and  $3.9 billion in CMBS holdings as of year-end 2015, the company also has direct  commercial real estate investments. Although these asset classes have largely  recovered since the financial crisis, Fitch views this level of exposure to be a  credit negative. PFG's investment portfolio continued to perform within  expectations as the company's realized investment losses remained at manageable  levels in 2015 and through the first nine months of 2016.  PFG, headquartered in Des Moines, IA, markets a range of retirement savings,  investment and insurance products and services primarily in the small- to  medium-sized business segment. The company reported consolidated assets of $223  billion, and total shareholders' equity of $10.6 billion at June 30, 2016. RATING SENSITIVITIES Key rating triggers that could result in an upgrade include: --Improved diversification of the company's sources of revenue and earnings; --Sustainable return on equity of 12% or higher and fixed-charge coverage above  12x; --Low volatility in earnings and capital over an extended period of time; --Financial leverage below 20%; --A PRISM capital model score of 'Extremely Strong'. Conversely, key rating triggers that could result in a downgrade include: --Run-rate return on equity below 10% and a GAAP-based fixed-charge coverage  ratio below 7x; --A decline in the company's reported RBC ratio to a level below 375% or a PRISM  capital model score below 'Strong'; --Sustained increase in financial leverage to a level above 25%.

17,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, November 04 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A-' rating to  Principal Financial Group, Inc.'s (PFG) issuances of $350 million of 10-year  senior unsecured notes and $300 million of 30-year senior unsecured notes. PFG's  Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) is unaffected by this rating action. KEY RATING DRIVERS The notes are guaranteed by Principal Financial Services, Inc., PFG's  intermediate holding company, whose Long-Term IDR is currently 'A'. Fitch  affirmed the ratings of PFG and its insurance operating subsidiaries with a  Stable Outlook on Oct. 27, 2016. The proceeds from the new senior unsecured debt issuances will be used to  refinance two of PFG's existing debt issuances: $300 million 1.85% notes due  November 2017 and $350 million 8.875% notes due May 2019. PFG is expected to  tender all of the outstanding 2017 and 2019 debt issuances simultaneously with  the close of the new debt issuance. In addition to the tender of the 2017 and  2019 debt, PFG expects to partially tender up to $150 million of outstanding  6.05% senior notes due 2036. PFG's ratings reflect the company's strong capitalization and stable, balanced  operating profitability, partially offset by above-average exposure to  commercial real estate through direct mortgages, structured mortgage securities,  and direct real estate investments. PFG's strong capitalization is supported by the organization's primary insurance  operating company, PLIC, which reported a risk-based capital ratio (RBC) of 431%  at Dec. 31, 2015. The company targets consolidated RBC in a range of 415% to  425%. PFG's PRISM capital model score is 'Very Strong', which is within  expectations for its current rating category.  The company's recent operating performance has remained stable. PFG's pre-tax  operating earnings were approximately $1.2 billion for the first three quarters  of 2016, relatively flat from the same period prior year, as weaker results from  first quarter 2016 equity market performance was largely offset by strong  performance in subsequent quarters. Fitch expects PFG's financial leverage to decline on a pro forma basis to  approximately 25.5% from 26.4% as of Sept. 30, 2016 as a result of the new debt  issuance and simultaneous tenders of existing debt. Although PFG's pro forma  financial leverage still slightly exceeds Fitch's rating tolerance of 25%, Fitch  expects financial leverage to decrease to 25% by year-end 2016. RATING SENSITIVITIES Key rating triggers that could result in an upgrade include: --Improved diversification of the company's sources of revenue and earnings; --Sustainable return on equity of 12% or higher and fixed-charge coverage above  12x; --Low volatility in earnings and capital over an extended period of time; --Financial leverage below 20%; --A PRISM capital model score of 'Extremely Strong'. Conversely, key rating triggers that could result in a downgrade include: --Run-rate return on equity below 10% and a GAAP-based fixed-charge coverage  ratio below 7x; --A decline in the company's reported RBC ratio to a level below 375% or a PRISM  capital model score of 'Strong'; --Sustained increase in financial leverage to a level above 25%. Fitch has assigned the following ratings: Principal Financial Group, Inc.  --$350 million 3.1% senior notes due Nov. 15, 2026 at 'A-'; --$300 million 4.3% senior notes due Nov. 15, 2046 at 'A-'.
