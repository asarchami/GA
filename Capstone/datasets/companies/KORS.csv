10,"   By Alicia Powell | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Michael Kors, whose namesake fashion house is best known for its urban-inspired women's clothing and accessories, has taken a more laid-back approach to its fall-winter collection with muted colors drawn from Northern California's craggy coastline.The line shown last week at New York's Fashion Week featured voluminous textured jackets and skirts with accents of fur and embroidered details, flowing printed dresses with cinched waists and chunky knits along with tailored coats and baggy trousers.Kors, 54, who serves as chief creative officer of Michael Kors Holdings Ltd, spoke with Reuters ahead of the show about why he doesn't think it's fair to pick a favorite design, spotting his designs on the street and why he likes to unwind in California.Q: What do you not mind talking about before a fashion show?A: I don't mind the 'What's the mood of the collection?' Because that's what I'm trying to evoke when we put on the show. It is a mood, it's a feeling, it's an attitude. What I never like, 'What's your favorite piece in the whole collection?' That's like asking a parent with a lot of children to throw most of their children under the bus, so that one is never my favorite. But what's the mood? Yeah, that's what it's all about. We're trying to dress people for their lives, but we're also trying to set a tone. Q: So about the mood ... what is that going to be?A: The mood is, well, I'm a big-city guy. I'm a New Yorker, and so many of my clients really are urban people all around the planet, but we all crave unplugging. The place that's the most wonderful for me to do that is Big Sur in Northern California: nature all around you, no cell (mobile) reception, no Wi-Fi and an easiness.There's a relaxed hands-in-the-pocket slouch to it that I love, but then, let's be honest, we all have to live this fast life. So this is really, 'How do you take that Big Sur attitude and bring it into the big city?' And it's (the fashion collection) the convergence of the two. Q: Here in New York, your name is seen everywhere on purses and bags, do you get used to seeing ...A: No, I get excited! I get excited. It's so funny. A lot of people say to me, 'You know, do you talk to people ...' I stop women all the time on the street: 'You look great. I love your bag.' They're like, 'I can't believe you noticed.' Sure, of course, I noticed. Listen, I think that for me, as much fun as a fashion show is, and it's a wonderful way for me to express myself, but nothing is more fabulous than seeing what you designed all over the streets. That's when you know that it works in people's lives. That's the most exciting thing. Q: The price of your company's stock has risen nearly 30 percent in the past month, and investment banks have recommended it.

11,"   By Alicia Powell | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Feb 19 Michael Kors, whose namesake fashion house is best known for its urban-inspired women's clothing and accessories, has taken a more laid-back approach to its fall-winter collection with muted colors drawn from Northern California's craggy coastline.The line shown last week at New York's Fashion Week featured voluminous textured jackets and skirts with accents of fur and embroidered details, flowing printed dresses with cinched waists and chunky knits along with tailored coats and baggy trousers.Kors, 54, who serves as chief creative officer of Michael Kors Holdings Ltd, spoke with Reuters ahead of the show about why he doesn't think it's fair to pick a favorite design, spotting his designs on the street and why he likes to unwind in California.Q: What do you not mind talking about before a fashion show?A: I don't mind the 'What's the mood of the collection?' Because that's what I'm trying to evoke when we put on the show. It is a mood, it's a feeling, it's an attitude. What I never like, 'What's your favorite piece in the whole collection?' That's like asking a parent with a lot of children to throw most of their children under the bus, so that one is never my favorite. But what's the mood? Yeah, that's what it's all about. We're trying to dress people for their lives, but we're also trying to set a tone. Q: So about the mood ... what is that going to be?A: The mood is, well, I'm a big-city guy. I'm a New Yorker, and so many of my clients really are urban people all around the planet, but we all crave unplugging. The place that's the most wonderful for me to do that is Big Sur in Northern California: nature all around you, no cell (mobile) reception, no Wi-Fi and an easiness. There's a relaxed hands-in-the-pocket slouch to it that I love, but then, let's be honest, we all have to live this fast life. So this is really, 'How do you take that Big Sur attitude and bring it into the big city?' And it's (the fashion collection) the convergence of the two.Q: Here in New York, your name is seen everywhere on purses and bags, do you get used to seeing ...A: No, I get excited! I get excited. It's so funny. A lot of people say to me, 'You know, do you talk to people ...' I stop women all the time on the street: 'You look great. I love your bag.' They're like, 'I can't believe you noticed.' Sure, of course, I noticed. Listen, I think that for me, as much fun as a fashion show is, and it's a wonderful way for me to express myself, but nothing is more fabulous than seeing what you designed all over the streets. That's when you know that it works in people's lives. That's the most exciting thing. Q: The price of your company's stock has risen nearly 30 percent in the past month, and investment banks have recommended it. Do you pay much attention to that side of the business?A: Honestly, I really concentrate on my client, what I'm working on - whether I had two employees back in 1981 or today when we have a global business - I've always kept my eye on the customer. I stay on the street, I keep my ear to the ground, and that's what really matters.Q: How closely do you pay attention to the competition?A: You've got to worry about yourself and what's right for you.",2014-02-20,KORS,"Wed Feb 19, 2014 | 7:24pm EST",A Minute With: Fashion's Michael Kors on 'staying on the street',http://www.reuters.com//article/fashion-michaelkors-idUSL2N0LO23120140220?type=companyNews

Start-up expenses, such as leasing costs, would hurt its retail operating margins in Europe, the company said, prompting its shares to fall as much as 4 percent in morning trading.The stock reversed course after rising 8 percent before the bell on Wednesday, when the company reported quarterly results that once again beat analysts' estimates.Sales in Europe, which accounts for about 10 percent of its total revenue, more than doubled to $164.7 million in the fourth quarter ended March 29. Sales in North America, its biggest market, rose 43 percent to $739.4 million on higher demand for its watches and small leather goods such as wallets and clutch bags. The strong sales helped Michael Kors grab market share from Coach Inc (COH.N), which last month reported its fourth straight quarterly decline in sales from North America. Strong demand for clutches and wristlets costing around $100 right through to snakeskin handbags with a $3,000 price tag helped Michael Kors post fourth-quarter revenue of $917.5 million, beating the average analyst estimate of $816.5 million. Michael Kors' first-quarter revenue forecast of $840 million-$850 million was also higher than the average analyst forecast of $826.1 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Net income rose 59 percent to $161 million, or 78 cents per share, in the fourth quarter.

19,"   By Siddharth Cavale and Devika  Krishna Kumar  May 29 Dazzled for two-and-a-half years, Wall Street finally blinked when Michael Kors Holdings Ltd  warned that its margins might suffer from the cost of opening stores in Europe.A pullback in the stock on Wednesday lasted only a few hours, investor confidence quickly restored by a revenue forecast that reinforced Michael Kors as the pre-eminent brand in affordable luxury.But for a stock that has quadrupled since its New York listing in December 2011, the hiccup betrayed investors' uneasiness about a valuation that towers above that of its peers. How, they ask, can breakneck growth be sustained?""It's going to get a little bit harder from here,"" said Wells Fargo Securities analyst Paul Lejuez, who has a price target range of $86 to $90 on a stock which closed on Wednesday at $97.01.Kors's shares were down about 5.5 percent at $91.68 in afternoon trading on Thursday.There is plenty of room to usurp luxury brands in Europe in the same way that Michael Kors has eclipsed rivals such as Coach Inc in the United States. At home, brand loyalty, e-commerce and a shift into department stores also promise growth.For investors, the biggest risk lies in the valuation. Kors trades at 23.69 times forward earnings, higher than an industry median of 17.27 times, according to Thomson Reuters data. Coach trades at 14.64 times forward earnings.Kors's stock should be trading at $58.41, according to StarMine's intrinsic valuation model, which takes analysts' five-year estimates and models the growth trajectory over a longer period of time.""Top-line momentum can't be denied, but with margins potentially peaking, there are fewer ways to win going forward,""  Sterne Agee retail analyst Ike Boruchow wrote in a note. He has a ""neutral"" rating and a price target of $100 on the stock. With a market capitalization of $19.8 billion, the company founded by fashion designer Michael Kors has already grown bigger than Coach, which is valued at about $11.2 billion.Marketing savvy has secured a loyal following online. Michael Kors' Facebook page has 13.8 million likes; Coach, a brand that has been around for much longer, has 5.3 million.One false step, though, and the stock has a long way to fall. Jefferies & Co analyst Randal Konik bumped his price target up to $95 on Thursday, but has a ""hold"" recommendation.""History reminds us that Coach was once the 'it' brand in accessible luxury, as KORS is today,"" he said. EUROPEAN EXPANSION Revenue up 39 percent or more every quarter since going public. Sixteen straight quarters, stretching back to before the IPO, of same-store sales growth in excess of 20 percent. Gross margins consistently above 57 percent.Every statistic thrown up by the company points to the popularity of its clutches and wristlets, which can cost as little as $100, of its watches that retail at between $150 and $550, and of snakeskin handbags that carry a $3,000 price tag.Wednesday's warning that gross margins are expected to fall in the next few quarters was unusual enough to precipitate a sudden 4 percent drop in the stock, which had been up 8 percent before the bell. The shares recovered to close up 1.3 percent. The short-term margin pressure, however, is part of an expansion into Europe that could be the next pillar of growth. Kors will open 55 stores in Europe in its financial year to March 2015, adding to the 80 already open.""Rather than 'overearning' in the near term and deferring large investments and expenses, management is choosing to re-invest some of that margin,"" said Janney Capital Markets analyst Adrienne Tennant, who has a ""buy"" rating.The plan, eventually, is to have as many as 200 stores in Europe, a region where fourth-quarter sales more than doubled.Sam Rines, equity analyst at Chilton Capital Management, said he believed Michael Kors could create a niche of its own.""Europe has a deeply ingrained fashion mentality with no shortage of well-known, high-end luxury retailers,"" he said. ""But aside from possibly Burberry, there are few accessible luxury brands.""The company is also reaching more customers back home. Familiarity helps: Kors himself, who retains a small stake in the company, is a well-known face after a long run as a judge on TV show ""Project Runway.""The company has also been upping its presence in big department stores such as Macy's and Nordstrom, converting its own stores into branded shop-in-shops that sell only some of its products, but reach a bigger audience.At least five brokerages, including Wedbush Securities and Goldman Sachs, raised their price targets on Thursday by as much as $14 to within a range of $110-$134. Each maintained a ""buy"" or similar rating on the stock.""With its international growth story still in its nascent stages,"" said Janney Capital's Tennant, ""we believe the positive momentum, driven by increasing brand awareness and customer loyalty, will continue for many quarters to come.""

They had risen 5 percent premarket after the company reported a better-than-expected first-quarter profit. Coach has been trying to boost sales in Asia and Europe as it loses ground to Michael Kors Holdings Ltd and Kate Spade & Co in its biggest market, North America, where sales dropped 19 percent in the quarter ended Sept. 27.Sales in China, which accounted for about 11 percent of total revenue last fiscal, rose only 10 percent. That matched the rise Coach expects for the whole of the current fiscal year ending June 2015.To compound its problems, sales in Japan, Coach's largest market by store count outside North America, declined for the eighth straight quarter, falling 12 percent. ""...Sustained weakness (in Japan) may signal that brand challenges in the U.S. are spilling over into international markets, adding risk to the mid-term outlook and the margin profile of the business, given higher margins in APAC,"" Credit Suisse analysts wrote in a note.Other luxury brands such as Burberry Group Plc and LVMH have warned of a slowdown in China, where a government crackdown on corrupt gift-giving has hurt sales of luxury goods.Coach, founded in 1941 in a loft in Manhattan, said it also had to shut down a couple of stores in Hong Kong during the pro-democracy demonstrations.""There will likely be continued volatility in the near-term due to both macro issues and the geopolitical events which are impacting trends in China and some key tourist markets, notably Hong Kong and Southeast Asia,"" Chief Executive Victor Luis said on a post-earnings call. Coach also said it expects weak sales to continue in Japan given the hike in the country's consumption tax in April this year.Coach's net income fell 45.3 percent to $119.1 million. Excluding items, it earned 53 cents per share.Net sales fell 10 percent to $1.04 billion.Analysts on average had expected earnings of 45 cents per share on revenue of $1 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.North America same-store sales decreased for the sixth straight quarter. But the 24 percent fall was slightly better than analysts estimates.Coach shares were down 5.6 percent at $34.13, after falling to $33.25. Up to Monday's close, they had fallen 35.5 percent this year, much steeper than the 17.9 percent fall in Kate Spade and 5.5 percent fall in Kors.

U.S. crude  rose 4.2 percent to settle at $50.48 following increased violence in producer Libya and an expected boost in oil demand from China's central bank easing. Some euro zone concerns eased as well. Greece proposed a bridging program until the end of May to allow time for debt talks, vowing to do everything in its power to avoid default.

Pfizer was among the biggest boosts to the S&P 500 after it said it would buy Hospira Inc for about $15 billion to boost its portfolio of generic injectable drugs and copies of biotech medicines.

The report comes on the heels of a private payrolls report that fell short of expectations on Wednesday and ahead of a monthly employment report on Friday.

45,"   By Nayan Das  Michael Kors Holdings Ltd (KORS) reported its slowest quarterly revenue growth since it went public in December 2011 as demand for its handbags and accessories weakened in North America, its biggest market.Shares of the company, which also forecast full-year sales and profit below analysts' expectations, fell as much as 19 percent to a two-and-a-half-year low of $49.03 on Wednesday. Michael Kors' revenue rose 17.8 percent in the fourth quarter, slowing sharply from the growth of 29.9-74.4 percent it posted for the past 13 quarters. Same-store sales in North America fell 6.7 percent. Analysts on average had expected a 4.4 percent rise, according to research firm Consensus Metrix. Lower tourist traffic in U.S. Northeast and Southeast, weak sales in its watches business and shipping delays due to disruptions at West Coast ports hurt sales in North America, Chief Financial Officer Joe Parsons said. Chief Executive John Idol said watch sales were expected to fall further this year. Michael Kors said it did not expect its handbag sales to ""wildly accelerate"" in North America and the category was growing slower than it had in the past five-six years.      The company's shares will remain under pressure as the North American market for handbags and accessories slows and competition intensifies, Baird Equity Research analyst Mark Altschwager wrote in a note.Michael Kors' margins fell to 58.4 percent from 59.9 percent as the company aggressively offered discounts to attract shoppers at a time rivals Coach Inc (COH.N) and Kate Spade & Co (KATE.N) are cutting back on promotions.  Michael Kors has been expanding heavily, opening stores and distributing to retailers such as Macy's Inc (M.N), which has led to brand fatigue among shoppers, analysts say. The handbag maker forecast revenue of $4.7 billion-$4.8 billion and earnings of $4.40-$4.50 per share for the year ending March 2016. The company said it expected a strong dollar to hurt profit by about 20 cents per share.Analysts were expecting revenue of $5.05 billion and earnings of $4.70 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Michael Kors said it expected same-store sales to be flat in fiscal 2016.The company's net income rose to $182.6 million, or 90 cents per share, in the quarter ended March 28 from $161 million, or 78 cents per share, a year earlier.   Revenue rose to $1.08 billion from $917.5 million. Michael Kors' shares were down 18.7 percent at $49.26 on the New York Stock Exchange.

Urban Outfitters shares ended down 7.4 percent, Tiffany & Co closed 3.37 percent lower and Michael Kors and Fossil both fell over 4 percent.Macy's Chief Executive Terry Lundgren said on a conference call he was not happy with the company's performance in the quarter ended Oct. 31.Sales at stores open at least a year fell 3.6 percent in their third straight quarterly decline. Analysts on average had expected 0.2 percent growth, according to research firm Consensus Metrix.Macy's said it expected same-store sales to fall by 1.8 percent to 2.2 percent for the year ending in January.The company cut its full-year profit forecast to $4.20 to $4.30 per share, excluding special items, from a prior range of $4.70 to $4.80. ""We are disappointed that the pace of sales did not improve in the third quarter, as we had expected,"" Lundgren said.Macy's slide in sales has lasted several quarters and Lundgren said the company would increase the focus of its turnaround plan, including product mix in stores and more experimentation with online sales.""We are wary of a drop in traffic but remain confident of the measures management is taking to fix some of its core problems,"" said Efrain Levy, equity analyst at S&P Capital IQ who reiterated his ""hold"" rating on the stock. REAL ESTATE Activist investor Starboard Value had urged Macy's in July to consider spinning off its real estate assets, valuing them at about $21 billion. The investor had said a REIT would trade at a higher multiple than the stores.""We and our board concluded there was not enough value to be created from the establishment of a REIT at this time,"" Lundgren  said.Instead, he said, Macy's would focus on forming potential partnerships or joint ventures for its four major flagship properties in New York's Herald Square, Union Square in San Francisco, State Street in Chicago, and downtown Minneapolis. The retailer will also look for ways to profit from or redevelop its real estate.Net income attributable to shareholders fell 45.6 percent to $118 million, or 36 cents per share, partly due to a charge for some planned store closings.Net sales fell 5.2 percent to $5.87 billion, the third straight quarter of declines and below the analysts' average estimate of $6.09 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Excluding items, Macy's earned 56 cents per share, exceeding analysts' expectations of 54 cents.(Reporting by Nandita Bose in Chicago and Sruthi Ramakrishnan in Bengaluru; Additional reporting by Ramkumar Iyer; Editing by Kirti Pandey, Lisa Von Ahn and Meredith Mazzilli)",2015-11-12,KORS,"Thu Nov 12, 2015 | 5:23am EST","REFILE-UPDATE 5-Macy's cuts full-year forecast, sends shivers through retail (Nov 11)",http://www.reuters.com//article/macys-results-idUSL3N13647I20151112?type=companyNews

In addition, the company said it would buy back up to $1 billion worth of shares. The company's shares rose 6.6 percent to $45.55 on Wednesday, recovering partially from a 30 percent fall since March.

That helped ease fears of a slowdown in global growth and,  along with a oil prices paring some losses on the likelihood of OPEC considering a new output ceiling, gave investor sentiment a boost.Investors have been mulling over the possibility of a interest rate hike in June. But, traders are now pricing in about a 23 percent chance of a hike this month, down from a probability of around 32 percent on Monday, according to the CME Group FedWatch tool.""We had some overnight data points out of China that gave investors some pause this morning,"" said Bill Northey, chief investment officer at U.S. Bank Private Client Group in Montana.

Also, unseasonably cool weather dampened sales of spring wear at major apparel retailers in the latest quarter.""The prevailing sentiment across retailing is that the customer has less interest in shopping in stores, whether it be traditional department stores or other luxury specialty stores,"" Chief Executive Karen Katz said.Sales at stores open for more than a year fell 5 percent for the third quarter ended April 30.Sales were hurt by international tourists spending less because of a strong dollar, while economic uncertainty due to stock market volatility and the upcoming presidential elections tempered domestic spending, Katz said.      Rivals Macy's Inc (M.N), which runs the luxury Bloomingdale's chain, and Nordstrom Inc (JWN.N) also reported lower same-store sales in the quarter.Neiman Marcus, which also operates the Bergdorf Goodman stores and mytheresa.com, said it was working with its suppliers to reduce inventory by cancelling orders, returning excess inventory and negotiating for additional markdown allowances. The retail slowdown has spooked suppliers such as Michael Kors Holdings Ltd (KORS) and Coach Inc (COH.N), which is pushing department store operators to cut back on promotions.Neiman Marcus' net income fell to $3.8 million from $19.8 million a year earlier, while revenue dropped 4.2 percent to $1.17 billion.

83,"   By Subrat Patnaik  Tiffany & Co (TIF.N) reported an unexpected rise in second-quarter profit as it sold more jewelry in Britain and the upscale jeweler benefited from lower costs of gold and other precious metals.Total net sales, however, fell 6 percent - the seventh straight quarter of declines. Same-store sales fell 8 percent, steeper than was expected.While the company has taken a hit due to muted tourist spending in the past several quarters, a sharply lower pound following the British vote to exit the European Union encouraged tourists in the country to loosen their purse strings.""We saw an uptrend in the UK sales almost immediately following the vote,"" vice president of investor relations, Mark Aaron, said on a conference call.""We believe that the weakening of the pound has made London a more attractive tourist shopping destination.""Shares of the company rose 8 percent to $74.46, their highest in nearly eight months and biggest intra-day percentage gain in about 16 months.Europe, which accounted for nearly 12 percent of the company's total net sales in the quarter, is its smallest business in terms of geography. Tiffany does not break out UK sales. The company, which makes the iconic ""Tiffany Setting"" diamond engagement ring, has been struggling to get back in the good books of wealthy American consumers, and woo hard-to-please millennials who are taking their business to cheaper and hipper shops.""The global environment continues to reflect well known challenges that we believe have had broad effects on spending by local customers, as well as foreign tourists, especially from China,"" Chief Executive Frederic Cumenal said in a statement.Lower tourist spending has also dented sales at luxury retailers such as Michael Kors Holdings Ltd (KORS) and Kate Spade & Co (KATE.N).Signet Jewelers Ltd (SIG.N), which sells jewelry at lower prices than Tiffany, on Thursday reported an unexpected drop in comparable sales for the quarter due to weaker demand for its Sterling and Zale lines. COMMODITY BENEFITS    Tiffany benefited from lower gold, silver and platinum prices, and also the sale of more high-margin jewelry, in the May-July quarter. While precious metal prices have risen sharply this year, they fell to multi-year lows last year, and it takes jewelry companies 9-12 months to make and get products to its shelves, Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough said. Tiffany's net income inched up to $105.7 million, or 84 cents per share, in the quarter ended July 31 from $104.9 million, or 81 cents per share, a year earlier.Analysts on average were expecting profit 72 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Tiffany maintained its full-year profit forecast of a net sales falling in the low single-digits in percentage terms, and earnings per share declining in the mid-single-digit percentage range. Total net sales in the second quarter fell to $931.6 million, lower than analysts' expectation of $934.74 million.
