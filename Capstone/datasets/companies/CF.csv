0,"   By Rod Nickel  Jan 14 The new chief executive of CF Industries Holdings Inc is open to finding a better capital structure for the U.S. fertilizer company, including the option of a master limited partnership, Tony Will said on Tuesday in his first interview since taking over this month.  The company will spend nearly $2 billion this year on its expansion of nitrogen production in Louisiana and Iowa, but Will said CF's interest is low in taking on a partner to reduce costs.

3,"  Feb 13 CF Industries Holdings Inc, the world's second-largest nitrogen fertilizer producer, said on Thursday that it has agreed to long-term deals to supply ammonium nitrate to customers.The deals come as Deerfield, Illinois-based CF focuses on nitrogen production after agreeing last year to sell its phosphate business to Mosaic Co for $1.4 billion. CF said it will supply 700,000 to 800,000 tons of industrial-grade ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrate solution annually to Orica International Pte. Ltd and Nelson Brothers LLC for at least 10 years starting in 2017. Orica provides commercial explosives and blasting systems to the mining and infrastructure markets, while Nelson  manufactures and distributes mining explosives. The deals provide steady demand for most of CF's production capacity from its Yazoo City nitrogen complex in Mississippi, and will lead to a $65-million reconfiguration of the plant in 2014, the company said.",2014-02-13,CF,"Thu Feb 13, 2014 | 4:43pm EST",CF Industries inks long-term deals to supply ammonium nitrate,http://www.reuters.com//article/cfindustries-nitrogen-idUSL2N0LI21R20140213?type=companyNews

13,"   By Balazs Koranyi and Joachim Dagenborg | OSLO  OSLO Norway's Yara and Chicago-based CF Industries are in talks about a merger of equals that would create a $27.5 billion global fertilizer producer to rival world No.1 Potash Corp in an oversupplied and fragmented market.The deal would give Yara, the world's biggest nitrate fertilizer maker, major production units in the United States, where costs are lower due to cheap gas. CF Industries would gain a global footprint through Yara's presence in 150 countries with production assets and a well established distribution network.The two firms' combined market capitalization of $27.5 billion would put it almost on par with Canada's Potash Corp of Saskatchewan, the world' largest fertilizer firm worth $28.9 billion. The firms said in separate filings that the talks were at an early stage, and there were no assurances that these would result in any transaction. Yara said it had been forced to go public because information about the talks were at a risk of a leak. It wanted to conclude the process quickly but said nothing was expected in the coming days.Yara shares surged nearly 9 percent in early trade and were 6 percent higher at 1330 GMT (9.30 a.m. EDT), valuing the company at $14.4 billion. CF rose 3.5 percent in early trade, giving the firm. Market capitalization of $13.2 billion.""At first glance, we view any future deal as positive for Yara,"" JPMorgan said in a note. ""A deal would diversify the company's cost base away from Europe – which remains one of the most expensive production regions globally."" ""Yara could integrate its US export/marketing business for example and expand its nitrate business into North America,"" the note said.The two firms fought a bitter battle in 2010 over control of U.S. rival Terra Industries, won by CF with a $4.7 billion offer. That deal also put Yara and CF into a 50/50 joint venture operating the GrowHow production units in Britain. Analyst said regulatory concerns would be minimal as CF focuses on the United States while Yara has few U.S. operations. CF has major production assets while Yara is stronger  downstream and it runs a coveted distribution network.With the deal CF would gain access to global distribution while Yara would benefit from cheap U.S. gas, the main ingredient in ammonia, which forms the base of nitrate fertilizers used in agricultural crops.Global fertilizer margins have been under pressure, mainly  due to Chinese overproduction, and the International Fertilizer Industry Association expects global production growth to well outpace demand at least through 2018. The association sees nitrogen fertilizer output rising nearly twice as fast as demand between 2014 and 2018, increasing the surplus in the market which could reach 9 percent of global production by 2018.""In terms of revenues, Yara has the highest revenues but the lower margin, while CF has higher margin and lower revenues,""     Per Haagensen, an analyst at RS Platou Markets said. ""It seems to me that it is a pretty fair merger of equals."" ""I don't think there will be a third company coming in and trying to join in because these are the two biggest nitrogen producers essentially.""  Yara is being advised by Citi and Norwegian brokerage ABG Sundal Collier.GOVERNMENT HURDLE  Potentially the biggest hurdle to any deal would be the Norwegian government, which owns a 36.2 percent stake in Yara.The government said in June it would not cut its stake below 34 percent and any change in that stance would likely require approval in parliament, an uphill battle as the government rules in a minority and relies on opposition parties to push through its agenda.The trade ministry said it had not taken a position while the majority of parties contacted by Reuters said they could support the deal as long as the combined firm's headquarters stayed in Norway and the state maintained a 34 percent stake.Another snag could be that Yara Chief Executive Joergen Ole Haslestad will be stepping down and will be replaced by Norsk Hydro CEO Richard Brandtzaeg in February.With U.S. gas prices trading near historic lows, Yara has been working to build capacity in North America and plans to build an ammonia plant with Germany's BASF in Texas.It has also been expanding rapidly in South America in recent years, buying Bunge's Brazilian fertilizer business and acquiring the majority of Brazilian phosphate miner Galvani Indústria.CF Industries in March sold its phosphate business to rival Mosaic Co for $1.4 billion to focus on its core nitrogen fertilizer products.

""I was informed about the merger talks just before the media was.""""I did not know about merger talks when I agreed with Yara in July and I am not obliged to take the CEO position of Yara under such circumstances,"" Brandtzaeg added.Yara and Chicago-based CF Industries announced this week that they were in early stage talks about a merger of equals that would create a rival in size to world number one fertilizer producer Potash Corp of Saskatchewan.Yara said Joergen Ole Haslestad would continue as interim CEO and it would relaunch its search for a new chief. ""The (merger) talks are at an early stage and it is important to emphasize that they are based on a common understanding that any merger will create significant value,"" Yara Chairman Leif Teksum told Reuters.Besides the search for a new CEO, the merger faces other hurdles. The Norwegian state owns 36 percent of Yara and plans to keep at least 34 percent of the firm. It also insists that the headquarters must remain in Oslo.""We continue to believe this potential merger is not a done deal, notably given the Norwegian government ownership,"" Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a research note.Even if the government wanted to change its stance, it rules in a minority and its opposition has already said it will not compromise. Teksum said he was ""very familiar"" with the government's stance and intentions with Yara.Norne Securities analyst Tomas Skeivys said Brandtzaeg's resignation could suggest the merger talks are further along than the companies acknowledge.""If the reason for Brandtzaeg's departure is that this is part of the negotiations about who gets the CEO position, given that the headquarters has to be in Norway, then it might suggest that the merger talks are at a more advanced stage than what they have led us to believe,"" he said.A GOOD MATCH  From a business perspective, Yara and CF are a good match with few overlaps and a lot of complementary operations, analysts have said.CF is focused on production and operates mainly in the United States while Yara has a better position in more complex products, blending and distribution, helped by a sales network in 150 countries.The deal would give CF access to a vast global distribution network while Yara would gain access to cheap U.S. gas, the top ingredient in fertilisers.At Hydro, Brandtzaeg established a reputation as a top manager, guiding the firm through one of the industry's most turbulent times and leading it into the current upswing with a top flight balance sheet.The benchmark aluminium price on the London Metal Exchange  has risen about 10 percent so far this year on expectations that the market will swing into deficit this year after many years of overproduction and surpluses.""Fundamentally, the market balance looks more promising than what we have seen for quite a long time,"" Brandtzaeg said.Shares of Hydro, also a hydro-electric power producer, are up 38 percent over the past year, outperforming the Oslo benchmark's 18 percent rise.Hydro shares traded flat on the Oslo bourse while Yara was down 1 percent.

Details of any deal have not been revealed.Yara Chairman Leif Teksum told Reuters the board wanted an executive who could lead merger talks with CF and who could have a role in a merged company. Haslestad was originally set to retire next year after leading Yara since 2008. ""Since Haslestad wasn't going to play any (post-merger) role, we believed it was important to put in place a person who was capable of delivering the merger conditions we'd potentially agree on,"" Teksum said.Haslestad did not oppose the merger talks, the chairman said, nor were there concerns about Yara's business performance under his leadership.Chief Financial Officer Torgeir Kvidal will take over as acting CEO and will lead the Yara team conducting the talks.

CF would gain a global footprint through Yara's presence in 150 countries with production assets and a well established distribution network.Potentially the biggest hurdle to any deal would be the Norwegian government, which owns a 36.2 percent stake in Yara.The government said in June it would not cut its stake below 34 percent and any change in that stance would likely require approval in parliament, which could be an uphill battle as the government rules in a minority and relies on opposition parties to push through its agenda.The two companies' combined stock market capitalisation of $27 billion would put it almost on a par with Canada's Potash Corp of Saskatchewan, the world's largest fertilizer firm worth $27.5 billion.Haslestad is effectively the second CEO casualty since the merger talks were announced last month. Yara had named aluminium producer Norsk Hydro CEO Svein Richard Brandtzaeg to run the group from early 2015, but he turned down the role after learning about the merger plan.Shares in Yara were down 1.6 percent at 1235 GMT, broadly in line with the Oslo benchmark index.

26,"  * Shares drop 4.3 pct* Announces $350 mln investment* Firm needs N. American strategy, say analysts   (Adds detail, analysts, shares, industry outlook)By Balazs KoranyiOSLO, Oct 22 Shares in Norwegian fertiliser firm Yara - still reeling from failed merger talks with CF Industries - fell more than 4 percent on Wednesday after it reported quarterly profit below market expectations.The global fertiliser industry has been expanding quickly this year as farmers' margins have remained high, keeping demand strong. The sector has also benefited from lower prices for natural gas, the main ingredient in nitrate fertilisers. Yara's core profit rose 24 percent in the third quarter but slightly missed analysts' forecasts. The world's biggest nitrogen fertiliser producer said gas prices had not declined as steeply as projected in the period and that profit had also been hit by unexpected maintenance work at an Australian plant.The Yara stock was among the worst performers on Europe's Stoxx 600 index on Wednesday, dropping 4.3 percent and trailing a 0.10 percent rise in the index. Yara is still up 18.7 percent over the past year, however, above the 0.9 percent gain in the index.The company said the outlook for the sector remained positive. It said it would spend $350 million to expand its production capacity in Norway and expects prices for its products to stay high on strong demand and fertiliser production capacity cuts in places like Ukraine and China. It also expects its European energy costs to fall by 1.15 billion crowns ($174 million) over the next two quarters.CF and Yara ended merger talks this month that would have created a firm on a par with industry leader Potash in terms of market capitalisation. A successful deal would have given Yara major production units in the United States, where costs are lower due to cheap gas. Analysts say the company needs to formulate a new strategy for North America, where it is building an ammonia plant but still lacks a major presence.""The announced $350 million investment in Norway is not what investors wanted to hear right now,"" Berenberg said in a note. ""We believe the Yara/CF merger talks fuelled ideas on higher cash returns to shareholders and Yara needs to consolidate the lower margin/lower cash flow trading and urea businesses before investing further.""Yara's quarterly earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) rose 24 percent to 4.00 billion crowns ($610 million).

28,"  U.S. fertilizer producer CF Industries (CF.N) reported a 44 percent drop in third quarter profit on Wednesday, a steeper than expected fall.Shares of CF, the world's No. 2 nitrogen fertilizer maker after Norway's Yara International ASA (YAR.OL), dropped more than 4 percent after normal trading hours in New York. They had closed at $253.63. Chief Executive Tony Will said the higher cost of natural gas, a key input in nitrogen fertilizer production, contributed to the drop in profit. Higher storage costs also reduced earnings. Net earnings fell to $130.9 million, or $2.62 a share, from $234.1 million, or $4.07 a share, a year earlier. Net sales for the Deerfield, Illinois, company dropped 16 percent to $921.4 million, reflecting the sale of CF's phosphate business to Mosaic Co (MOS.N). CF's nitrogen sales volume rose 6 percent, with half of the increase due to a contract with Mosaic.Analysts, on average, had expected CF to earn $3.47 a share on sales of $932.4 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. A drop in grain prices and a delayed U.S. harvest have hampered farmers' purchases of fertilizer. But CF said it has a ""positive"" outlook on the current fourth quarter as farm economics remain attractive and North American natural gas costs have dropped from their 2014 highs.An unplanned outage at its Woodward, Oklahoma, complex last month will reduce volumes of UAN (urea-ammonium nitrate) and cut cash operating earnings by $20 million, CF said.

39,"   By Rod Nickel  North American nitrogen fertilizer producers Agrium Inc (AGU.TO) and CF Industries (CF.N) reported higher second-quarter profits on Wednesday after markets closed.Agrium's quarterly profit beat expectations for the Canadian company, while earnings for Illinois-based CF matched the average estimate.Agrium lowered the top end of its 2015 profit forecast to a range of $7.00 to $7.50 from $7.00 to $8.25 per share, due to the impact of low crop prices on farmers and second-half potash and phosphate prices that are expected to be lower than previous guidance. U.S.-listed shares of Agrium, North America's biggest retail seller of seed, fertilizer and crop chemicals, eased after normal trading hours, while CF stock gained 1.5 percent.Less U.S. planting this spring of corn, a crop that uses much fertilizer, wet weather in the U.S. corn belt and lower crop prices caused farmers to think twice about spending to maximize production. Dry conditions in Western Canada also hurt farmer spending on fertilizer, Agrium said. Agrium's net earnings from continuing operations for the second quarter rose to $675 million, or $4.71 per share, from $625 million, or $4.34 per share a year ago. On an adjusted basis, earnings were $701 million, or $4.90 per share. Analysts on average expected Agrium to earn $4.78 a share in the second quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Agrium sales fell to $6.99 billion from 7.3 billion, versus expectations for $7.3 billion.CF's net earnings rose to $352 million or $1.49 per share from $313 million or $1.22 per share a year earlier.Net nitrogen sales for the Deerfield, Illinois company fell to $1.31 billion from $1.45 billion.

53,"   By Rod Nickel  Sinking crop prices and frenzied output growth by nitrogen fertilizer producers have sparked nearly $10 billion worth of deals in the fragmented sector and signal more consolidation may  be ahead in the largest of three crop nutrient markets.Illinois-based CF Industries Holdings Inc (CF.N), the world's third-largest nitrogen fertilizer producer, was involved in three of four deals in the past month, taking out two potential competitors in its backyard and locking up sales volumes in the United States, the world's No. 1 corn-producing country. ""What CF is doing is classic corporate self-preservation in a world where there are well-financed people trying to get into their core Midwest and U.S. Gulf Coast nitrogen market,"" said Chris Damas, editor of the BCMI Report on markets.Unlike in the potash and phosphate industries dominated by a few players, the top 20 nitrogen companies account for just over one-third of global supply, according to consultancy CRU Group. CF's share is less than 4 percent, it said.On Wednesday farmer co-operative CHS Inc (CHSCP.O) ditched plans to spend $3 billion building a plant in North Dakota and agreed instead to pay $2.8 billion for a stake in CF's nitrogen fertilizer unit, while securing a supply deal.That move followed last Thursday's announcement CF would buy Netherlands-based rival OCI NV's (OCI.AS) North American and European plants for $6 billion, to become the biggest publicly traded nitrogen player. The deals increase CF's market clout by removing two potential U.S. rival plants, just as Agrium Inc (AGU.TO), Yara International (YAR.OL), Koch Industries [KCHIN.UL] and others build North American capacity. CVR Partners LP (UAN.N) said on Monday it would buy Rentech Nitrogen Partners LP RNF.N for $533 million, creating North America's fifth-largest nitrogen maker.Potash Corp's (POT.TO) $8.6 billion takeover bid for German rival K+S AG (SDFGn.DE) has captured headlines this summer, a deal that would expand the reach of the world's biggest fertilizer producer.POORER TIMES ON THE FARM The incentive to cut deals in nitrogen fertilizer starts at the farm gate. Falling grain prices have lightened farmers' wallets, especially after corn Cc1 plunged Wednesday to a nearly 10-month low.With lower crop receipts, farmers cannot afford to pay as much for fertilizer and other farm inputs, although farmers apply nitrogen more regularly than other nutrients.Earlier this year, North American prices of urea, a popular form of nitrogen, slid to a four-year low of less than $300 per tonne.Global demand for nitrogen in 2014/15 is forecast by International Fertilizer Industry Association at 112 million tonnes of nutrient, about three times phosphate demand and about four times the size of the potash market. In the CHS deal, CF also secures sales of up to 1.7 million tons annually, similar to its 2014 ammonia-supply deal with phosphate producer Mosaic Co (MOS.N), providing significant sales in uncertain times.The moves come as global surpluses of urea and ammonia are expected to creep higher to nearly one-fifth of production by 2018, according to a May report by BMO Capital Markets.That fragmented nature of the industry means it takes longer for producers to rein in output when times are tough.""You're in a down cycle, commodity prices are down, I think people might be seeing it as a prolonged period,"" said CHS Chief Executive Officer Carl Casale in an interview.""(Producers) see that as an opportunity to consolidate the industry (and) that would be driving a lot of public company activity.""

81,"   By Rod Nickel  CF Industries Holdings Inc, known as an active dealmaker, intends to now focus on its own expanding operations as the nitrogen fertilizer industry slumps, its chief executive officer said on Thursday.   Illinois-based CF shares slid as much as 15.3 percent on Thursday after its second-quarter profit fell 87 percent and the company warned that prices would remain weak into next year. CF, which suspended share buybacks, is more focused on running its own plants than acquiring others that may be available, such as Ukraine's state-owned Odessa Portside plant, or OCI NV's Iowa plant, currently under construction, CEO Tony Will said in an interview.""Our focus right now is sticking to our knitting ... For me to go out and look at other assets when our own shares are trading so cheaply, it just doesn't make sense,"" he told Reuters.  CF and Dutch rival OCI scrapped an agreement in May for CF to buy some plants for $6 billion, following the U.S. Treasury's steps to curb tax-avoiding inversion deals.OCI's Iowa plant was part of that transaction, but Will said he would not pay OCI the construction cost for it, given the weak market, and OCI is not interested in taking a write-off in any sale. ""The last thing we need to do right now is take on another in-flight construction project,"" he said.An OCI spokesperson could not be immediately reached.CF plans to run its expanded U.S. plants at full throttle and expects domestic rivals to do the same, despite global oversupply, Will said. The world's third-biggest nitrogen fertilizer producer is finishing expansions in Louisiana and Iowa this year, giving it capacity of 18.9 million tonnes by 2017.""North American producers are among the lowest cost globally, so anyone that's got assets that are producing in North America are going to run those plants full out,"" Will told analysts earlier. Will said in the interview that the company intends to displace some imports through improved transportation to the U.S. East Coast and Ohio Valley, and with an ammonia supply agreement with Mosaic Co taking effect in January. Higher-cost producers in China are already curtailing nitrogen production, and North American buyers are expected to import nearly one-third of their nitrogen requirements next year, Will said.Cheap natural gas, a key ingredient in nitrogen fertilizer production, gives North American producers a cost advantage over other regions.CF shares were off 13.6 percent to $21.19 after falling as low as $20.77.
