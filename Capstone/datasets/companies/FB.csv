0,"   By Allison Martell and Ioana Patran | TORONTO/BUCHAREST  TORONTO/BUCHAREST Facebook and other social networks are making it easier for anti-mining activists to derail projects, helping them get their message out and organize more quickly against an industry that is already struggling with high costs and volatile prices.From Romania to Peru to Canada, protest movements have disrupted projects in recent years, in part because activists have harnessed the power of social media and mobile technology, parties on both sides of the disputes say.Civil unrest can spell disaster for mining projects at any stage, even after billions have been invested. That is not new. What has changed is activists' ability to mobilize, a trend that echoes political upheavals that social media have helped fuel across the Middle East and North Africa.The saga of Rosia Montana, the Romanian region where Canada's Gabriel Resources Ltd wants to build Europe's biggest open-pit gold mine, offers a clear illustration of how social media has shifted the balance of power.Gabriel's push to get the project approved suffered a series of setbacks in the autumn after activists used Facebook to organize demonstrations across the country.""Our experience in Romania is not unique, but certainly the take-away is that the best project in the world can be portrayed as the worst unless the host government stands up to the vocal minority,"" Chief Executive Jonathan Henry said of the impact of the Facebook campaigns against Rosia Montana.The project has been in the works for nearly 15 years, and until Romania's government backed it in late August, years had passed without major protests. But activists mobilized quickly on Facebook after the government showed support for the mine, and within days thousands hit the streets.In November a parliamentary commission rejected a draft bill that would have allowed the project to proceed. A second attempt to approve the project as part of a new mining law failed in December.With the support of many members of parliament from the governing coalition, Gabriel is still fighting for Rosia Montana, its only advanced project. But its shares have fallen by nearly half since large-scale protests started.Without social media the protests would not have been as well-organized, Henry said.VULNERABLE TO PROTESTS Gabriel's experience in Romania parallels what many other mining companies have encountered around the world. The industry is under pressure to meet stricter environmental standards and share more revenue with host countries and nearby communities.In a report on risks to the mining industry last month, accounting and consulting firm Deloitte flagged intensifying demands from local communities, which it said have been ""elevated"" by social media. It said the mining industry's access to new resources is ""at risk like never before"". It is difficult to measure the impact of the new activism because comprehensive data on project costs and the reasons for delays is not readily available, but examples abound.In the past year, protests have hit Eldorado Gold Corp in Greece, Centerra Gold Inc in Kyrgyzstan, HudBay Minerals Inc in northern Manitoba, and De Beers' Victor mine in northern Canada, to name just a few.The nature of the mining industry makes it vulnerable to protests. It takes years of work and millions of dollars to secure permits and begin construction, and legislators can stall approvals or impose new taxes before the investment pays off.Forging ahead with a troubled project is often much cheaper than starting from scratch somewhere else, so in many cases, companies bend to public pressure.In December, Centerra reached a tentative deal that could give the government of Kyrgyzstan a much bigger stake in its Kumtor gold mine, following riots and calls for nationalization in the Central Asian county.In September, Anglo American pulled out of the Pebble copper-gold project in Alaska, which had been targeted by protesters and criticized by environmental regulators.Newmont Mining Corp halted construction at its massive Conga copper-gold mine in Peru in 2011 after violent protests, and the company is still working to win the support of nearby communities. Jamie Sokalsky, chief executive of Barrick Gold Corp, said in an autumn interview that social networks can help stir up social unrest, and that, in turn, emboldens governments in their dealings with mining companies.""We have to do a better job of not only describing the true costs, but also the benefits, than we have,"" he said.Barrick's recently mothballed Pascua-Lama project, on the border of Chile and Argentina, was unpopular with environmentalists from the start because of its proximity to glaciers. Nearby communities have staged street protests, and some activists have organized online.LONG HISTORY Rosia Montana was first a mining district more than 2,000 years ago. An abandoned open cast mine sits at the center of Gabriel's site, but the company has proposed a much larger operation. It would dig four open pits and fill much of a nearby valley with tailings. Some local villagers would have to move; others already have.Memories of a 2000 cyanide spill from a gold tailings pond in northern Romania are still fresh, and some want an outright ban on the toxic chemical, which Gabriel would use to process ore, a normal industry practice. For its part, Gabriel says it would abide by tough environmental standards, and tailings that contain small amounts of cyanide would be safely contained.All sides agree that social media has played a pivotal role in the conflict over the project. ""The protests and text messages and emails that my colleagues have received created a certain pressure on those who voted,"" said Florin Iordache, a lower house member of the governing Social Liberal Union, who was part of the commission that rejected in November a draft bill to allow the project to proceed.Gabriel also uses Facebook: its Romanian-language page has been ""liked"" more than 700,000 times. The company says it has the support of many local people, and mine supporters have staged some of their own protests over the years, though nowhere near the scale of those of their opponents.GLOBAL NETWORKS Social media is becoming a more powerful tool because more people, even in the less developed economies where many mining projects are located, have access to the Internet.Stephen Letwin, chief executive of Iamgold Corp, a mid-tier miner based in Canada, said he now gets ""friend"" requests from his workers in Suriname and Burkina Faso.""You go out to some of these villages ... and see people with iPhones, riding their camels,"" said Letwin, who believes social networks have helped Iamgold maintain good relationships with local communities and governments.To be sure, social media is not an organizing tool in every conflict. Many who live in developing and emerging economies do not have reliable connections. And parallel trends, such as the spread of democracy, have likely played a role in heightening conflict over resource development.But even where access is spotty, a quick phone call to someone who is online can get protesters' messages to more political leaders, voters and investors than ever before.Activists opposing Newmont's Conga project phone in reports for local websites, which then share them widely. They believe the publicity has helped them win crucial support in Lima, Peru's capital, and make demonstrations safer for protesters.Marco Arana, a former Catholic priest and founder of Peru's left-leaning Tierra y Dignidad party, said he was at a protest in March when several hundred armed police ordered activists to clear out.He posted photos online and others called local radio stations, and the police backed off. He says that without the public scrutiny, ""things could have gotten really ugly"".""I joined Twitter because I'd been told it's a good tool for showing the world what is going on and could prevent dangerous situations,"" he said. ""I never thought it would be so important.""(Additional reporting by Mitra Taj in Lima, Peru and Alexandra Ulmer in Santiago; Editing by Jeffrey Hodgson and Peter Galloway)",2014-01-07,FB,"Tue Jan 7, 2014 | 10:46am EST",Analysis: Social media empowers anti-mining activists,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-mining-media-analysis-idUSBREA060OA20140107?type=companyNews

4,"   By Jonathan Kaminsky  A woman held captive for six months by a former boyfriend who threatened to kill her if she tried to escape was rescued from a Nevada motel after writing about her plight on Facebook, police said on Tuesday.Her captor, Jason Greniger, 34, was arrested on Saturday at the MV Motel in Mesquite, a golfing and gambling resort town 80 miles northeast of Las Vegas, said Detective Sergeant MaQuade Chesley, a spokesman for the Mesquite Police Department.The woman, Sheena Herschbach, had not been physically restrained by Greniger during the ordeal and was regularly sent to a nearby store for food and beer, Chesley said.""She had opportunities to contact police, it just took her six months to get the courage to do it,"" Chesley said. ""She legitimately believed that he would kill her, hurt her or hurt her family if she didn't stay with him."" Greniger was being held at the Clark County Detention Center in Las Vegas on suspicion of second-degree kidnapping and also on an outstanding warrant from Minnesota stemming from a charge of first-degree felony malicious punishment of a child, Chesley said.He is due in court on Wednesday in Mesquite in the kidnapping case, which will be resolved before the Minnesota case is adjudicated, Chesley said. Herschbach turned to Facebook to seek help after Greniger, in an uncharacteristic move, allowed her to visit a nearby public library on Saturday, Chesley said.Her post, presented as written, read, ""I just whant to let every one know im sarry I whant to come home but he wont let me."" Chesley confirmed the authenticity of the post, which also gave her whereabouts.Later that day, Mesquite police were told of the post and went to the motel, where they arrested Greniger, Chesley said.Herschbach had until Saturday been out of contact with her family, including several children, for six months and only learned of her mother's December death after being freed, Chesley said.(Reporting by Jonathan Kaminsky in Olympia, Washington; Editing by Cynthia Johnston)",2014-01-14,FB,"Tue Jan 14, 2014 | 6:25pm EST",Woman rescued from Nevada motel after six months as captive: police,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-usa-nevada-kidnapping-idUSBREA0D1LT20140114?type=companyNews
5,"   By Alina Selyukh and David Ingram | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON A U.S. appeals court on Tuesday rejected federal rules that required Internet providers to treat all web traffic equally, a decision that could allow mobile carriers and other broadband providers to charge content providers for faster access to websites and services.The Federal Communications Commission's open Internet rules, also known as net neutrality, required Internet service providers to give consumers equal access to all lawful content without restrictions or tiered charges.But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit struck down the rules, which were passed in late 2010 and have been challenged by Verizon Communications Inc.Two judges, with partial support from a third, said the commission has the authority to regulate broadband access but had failed to show that it has a mandate to impose the anti-discrimination rules on broadband providers.The ruling is a victory for Verizon and other broadband providers, who saw the FCC rules as government overreach into how they operate their networks.The largest providers on Tuesday pledged that they would not restrict customers on the web, but consumer advocacy groups worry that Internet network owners may begin charging content providers such as Netflix Inc, Facebook Inc or sports broadcaster ESPN for faster Internet speeds.President Barack Obama, whose 2008 campaign platform included net neutrality, will continue to work with the FCC, Congress and the private sector ""to preserve a free and open Internet,"" the White House said on Tuesday.""The President remains committed to an open Internet, where consumers are free to choose the websites they want to visit and the online services they want to use, and where online innovators are allowed to compete on a level playing field based on the quality of their products,"" the statement said.POTENTIAL NEXT STEPS This was the second time the court struck down the FCC's net neutrality rules. The FCC had classified broadband providers as information service providers as opposed to telecommunications service providers, and that distinction created a legal hurdle for the FCC's authority. The FCC could appeal the ruling to the full appeals court or to the U.S. Supreme Court, something FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler said he is considering as among ""all available options"" to ensure Internet networks remained free and open.The FCC could also reclassify broadband providers to establish clear authority over them. Public interest groups have urged the FCC to do so, but the move would face opposition from Republicans and broadband providers.""Unless Congress acts, we should stay our hand and refrain from any further attempt to micromanage how broadband providers run their networks,"" Republican FCC Commissioner Ajit Pai said.Democratic leaders in Congress on Tuesday urged the FCC to take advantage of the oversight power the court did recognize the FCC has over broadband and offered support in rewriting the rules. Republicans urged the FCC to stay hands-off.Wheeler, who took helm at the FCC in November, recently has also suggested he could use existing FCC power to go after particular Internet service providers who violate the open Internet principles on a case-by-case basis. PLEDGE TO OPEN INTERNET Supporters of the FCC rules worry that now Internet providers such as Verizon or Comcast Corp would begin to charge content providers for faster access or slow down or even block access to particular sites.""That's just not the way the Internet has worked until now,"" Matt Wood, policy director at public interest group Free Press, told Reuters.Video-streaming is by far the heaviest bandwidth hog on the Internet. Netflix and Google Inc's YouTube alone are estimated to account for more than half of all downstream Internet traffic at peak hours.The debate is expected to intensify as American viewers increasingly take to the Internet for bandwidth-intensive media consumption, through services such as Pandora, Amazon Instant Video or Hulu. Some worry that giving Internet providers more power to charge for heavy use of their networks could penalize startups and other less cash-flush companies, who might be unable to get their product in front of users, thwarting competition.But opponents of the FCC's open Internet rules also argue the regulations inhibit investments and are not necessary to ensure unrestricted access to Internet content.""Today's decision will not change consumers' ability to access and use the Internet as they do now,"" Randal Milch, Verizon's general counsel and executive vice president for public policy, said in a statement.""Verizon has been and remains committed to the open Internet which provides consumers with competitive choices and unblocked access to lawful websites and content when, where, and how they want. This will not change in light of the court's decision,"" Milch said.In the case against the FCC, Verizon had argued the open Internet order violated the company's right to free speech and stripped control of what its networks transmit and how.Prominent Internet providers Comcast and Time Warner Cable Inc also issued reassurances of their commitment to open Internet principles on Tuesday, as did the Broadband for America coalition representing various Internet service providers and CTIA, the wireless industry association.But content providers remained uneasy.""Trust but verify,"" said Michael Beckerman, president and CEO of the Internet Association that represents content providers including Netflix, Google, Facebook and Amazon.com Inc.""With the Internet and our member companies growing and changing and startups constantly popping up, protections do need to be placed for consumers.""(Reporting by Alina Selyukh and David Ingram; Additional reporting by Lisa Richwine in Los Angeles, Edwin Chan and Alexei Oreskovic in San Francisco, Sinead Carew in New York and Steve Holland in Washington; Editing by Will Dunham, Sofina Mirza-Reid, Cynthia Osterman and Bernard Orr)",2014-01-14,FB,"Tue Jan 14, 2014 | 5:41pm EST",U.S. appeals court strikes down FCC net neutrality rules,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-usa-court-netneutrality-idUSBREA0D11420140114?type=companyNews

7,"  LONDON Jan 17 The London Stock Exchange  has appointed former Facebook executive Joanna Shields and start-up investor Sherry Coutu to its board to help encourage tech companies to list in the British capital.LSE Group chairman Chris Gibson-Smith said Shields and Coutu brought strong track records as entrepreneurs and in building businesses to the company as non-executive directors.Britain has helped technology start-ups through policy and tax initiatives but many companies still prefer to list in the United States, where analysts say investors have a better understanding of the sector. LSE launched a high-growth market segment nearly a year ago geared towards digital industries, for example by relaxing the requirements made on the number of shares required to be in free float, but no companies have yet listed using the new rules. Shields, who has also worked for Google and AOL, will step down as chief executive of Tech City, the UK government-funded initiative aimed at supporting the technology sector, on Feb. 3 although she will remain as chairman, the organisation said separately. She will be replaced by Gerard Grech, who has worked with app developers and start-ups at Blackberry, Nokia  and Orange, Tech City UK said.Coutu sits on the advisory board of LinkedIn Corp, and has experience in founding and leading tech companies and investing in start-ups, the LSE said.",2014-01-17,FB,"Fri Jan 17, 2014 | 7:12am EST",London Stock Exchange names new directors from tech sector,http://www.reuters.com//article/lse-tech-idUSL5N0KR1K420140117?type=companyNews

10,"   By Alexei Oreskovic | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Jan 17 Beyonce fans got a big surprise at midnight on Dec. 13, when the pop star announced her new album from out of the blue.Just as surprising was her decision to announce the album by posting a 15-second video on Instagram, the Facebook  -owned online photo-and-video sharing service.The exclusive announcement - virtually unheard of for a recording artist of that caliber - was a coup for Facebook, which has been upstaged by younger rival Twitter Inc as the go-to online forum for celebrities, sports and news.Potentially billions of dollars in television advertising are at stake as consumers increasingly turn to social networks to stay abreast of the latest news and entertainment. Twitter and Facebook both are wooing advertisers with video ad platforms and trying to hold off mobile communications startups like WhatsApp and SnapChat, which have lured many younger users.Leading the Facebook charge is Dan Rose, vice president of partnerships, acquisitions chief, and architect of some of the social network's key deals during his eight years there.Rose maintains a low profile compared with Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's founder, and Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, whose ""Lean In"" book on women in business was a cause celebre. A surfer, Rose has a reputation as calm, friendly but persistent at the 5,800-employee company.Previously at Amazon.com, the 42-year-old Rose helped launch the Kindle reader and nail down deals with publishers.When Facebook's stock was beaten down in the wake of its IPO in May 2012, Rose told an all-staff meeting that Amazon plowed through the turbulence of its early years by ignoring the ""noise"" around it and focusing on long term goals, a person who was present at the meeting said.His approach has helped Rose find common ground in sometimes tricky relationships. He was instrumental in three years of talks to win Apple Inc permission in 2012 for Facebook to tap directly into iPhone features like pictures, as well as a 2006 advertising pact with Microsoft Corp which a year later made a seminal investment in the young company.Now Rose is spearheading the efforts to broaden the Facebook conversation, dominated by talk of friends and family, by tying up with celebrities, news organizations and other ""content"" providers.People ""like to see stuff from their friends, that's where Facebook started and kind of where our origin is, but they also really like to see stuff from public voices,"" said Rose. ""When that type of stuff shows up in people's newsfeeds they like it, they click on it, they comment on it, they engage with it,"" Rose said in an interview.In November, Rose and Facebook product chief Chris Cox hosted a lunch at the posh Soho House club in West Hollywood with representatives of various celebrities, including Madonna,  rapper Pitbull and actor Channing Tatum.In recent months, Rose's team has also made frequent visits to broadcasters and other media organizations, preaching the virtues of Facebook and discussing potential partnerships. Facebook may soon announce a series of tie-ups with a broadcaster around some popular television shows and sporting events, a source familiar with the matter said.""There's a lot of disconnect between Hollywood and the Valley on many different fronts. He plays a really important role,"" said Guy Oseary, the manager for Madonna and band U2, who was at Soho House lunch.MORE THAN JUST FRIENDS  Analysts say Facebook's efforts to recast itself as the virtual town square for public conversations about everything from yesterday's football game to breaking news will not be easy.""Facebook is still the place where you see friends,"" said Ben Schachter of Macquarie Research. Changing consumers' online habits is tough, he added.Some media and entertainment organizations, such as the ESPN television sports network, have nearly as many followers on Twitter as they do on Facebook, even though Facebook's total audience of 1.2 billion active members is five times Twitter's. CNN and CNBC have more followers on their Twitter accounts than on Facebook.Twitter, known for 140-character messages, has created a system for broadcasters to show video clips and ads through tweets coordinated with what is being shown on TV. In September it struck a deal with the National Football League to show video highlights of games on Twitter.Past efforts to nudge consumers into using Facebook's social network in different ways have fizzled, from movie rentals to online shops by big retailers.Facebook said the movie rentals were an effort that the film studios initiated on their own, and noted that the current focus on public content is aimed at better supporting user behavior that's already occurring on its social network. Facebook users posted 20 million comments and ""likes"" about the opening game of the National Football League season as the match unfolded.On Thursday, Facebook took a page from Twitter and introduced a ""Trending"" feature, offering a personalized list of hot discussion topics.STAR POWER To cozy up to the media and entertainment industry, Rose needs to demonstrate the benefits of its social network and its massive audience, something rival Twitter has proven adept at.""I think of it kind of like nation-state relationships, for these larger companies and these larger partnerships, where you have diplomats and ambassadors,"" said Rose. ""The goal of those people is to find areas of mutual shared interest.""In September, Facebook began providing broadcasters with  reports detailing the conversations their shows generated on the social network. And it created special tools to help programs such as ABC's ""Dancing with the Stars"" incorporate public comments of Facebook users into their shows.Rose has also turned the mergers and acquisitions team, which he runs, to the project.

15,"   By Noel Randewich | SAN JOSE, California  SAN JOSE, California Facebook Inc's executive in charge of revolutionizing data centers on Tuesday lauded low-energy server technology that is expected to compete against heavyweight Intel Corp.The social networking firm's three-year push to help companies design better data center gear is gaining momentum and paying off with a range of cost-saving improvements, Open Compute Project head Frank Frankovsky told an industry conference here.He pointed to plans by some companies to launch server chips based on low-power technology licensed from ARM Holdings, whose technology is widely used in smartphones.""It might be coming to fruition about six months after the most optimistic among us thought, but we are absolutely going to see a much more rich ecosystem in CPU choice as we move through 2014 and into 2015,"" said Frankovsky.Servers are the brains and guts of online networks, handling computations and managing tasks. Intel dominates the server market with its powerful Xeon processors and stands to lose if server chips based on a rival architecture catch on. It has launched its own low-power chips in anticipation of a move toward microservers by major Internet players like Facebook and Google.For some kinds of data-center workloads, several chips drawing minimal amounts of electricity and working together can work more efficiently than one of Intel's brawny server chips, proponents of microservers say.Struggling with a shrinking PC industry, chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices has been developing and testing ARM-based chips for servers. Sunnyvale, California-based Applied Micro Circuits is also launching its own ARM-based server processors. Both companies said they would soon start sampling their chips with customers. With off-the-shelf data center products falling behind Facebook's growing technical requirements, the world's top social media network in 2011 launched the Open Compute Project to push major technology companies to design and build hardware better-suited to running its massive Internet services.Over the past three years, efforts by Facebook to make its infrastructure more efficient have saved the company over $1.2 billion, said Jay Parikh, vice president of infrastructure.Its collaborative approach, with Facebook sharing its data center standards and asking partners to improve on them, is inspired by open source software projects like Linux, in which developers from different companies contribute and share improvements. Microsoft Corp, a New Open Compute member but a technology heavyweight not traditionally known for sharing its expertise, has contributed cloud-server specifications that it says significantly reduce costs, as well as source code.Since it started, the project has focused on improved standards for information storage, power supply, hardware racks and other data-center components.While the Open Compute Project's new standards and products have benefited Facebook, it is not clear how much they are helping smaller companies with different, less-demanding data-center requirements, said Patrick Moorhead, an analyst at Moor Insights and Strategy, who was at Tuesday's event.""After three years ... you would expect many, many enterprises to get up and talk about how they've purchased OCP-compliant hardware, but that's not really happening,"" Moorhead said.(Reporting by Noel Randewich; Editing by Dan Grebler)",2014-01-28,FB,"Tue Jan 28, 2014 | 4:44pm EST",Facebook cites progress on low-power server technology,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-facebook-servers-idUSBREA0R1OZ20140128?type=companyNews

Some investors have been bracing for a correction, given the S&P 500's gain of 30 percent last year.Trading was volatile after the Fed's move, which further reduces its monthly bond purchases by $10 billion a month. Declines were fairly broad-based, with nine of the 10 S&P 500 sector indexes ending lower. Shares of Boeing Co ranked among the biggest drags on both the Dow and the S&P 500.Overall improvement in the U.S. economy suggested the central bank would continue to cut the purchases, but some investors had speculated in recent days that the Fed might rethink its plan because of the emerging market problems. ""I think investors had hoped that the Fed would somehow respond to the recent turbulence and show they had their back,"" said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer of BMO Private Bank in Chicago.But the Fed really wants ""to move to the sidelines here and get out of the QE business.""In its announcement, the Fed said it would buy $65 billion in bonds per month starting in February, down from $75 billion now. In what was Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke's last policy-setting meeting, the central bank also maintained its longer-term plan to keep U.S. interest rates low for some time to come.The benchmark S&P 500 has lost ground in four of the past five sessions as fears over slowing growth in China and large capital outflows from developing markets prompted investors to seek safe-haven assets.The Dow Jones industrial average fell 189.77 points or 1.19 percent, to end at 15,738.79. The S&P 500 lost 18.30 points or 1.02 percent, to finish at 1,774.20. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 46.53 points or 1.14 percent, to close at 4,051.43. The CBOE Volatility Index or VIX, Wall Street's barometer of fear, jumped 9.81 percent to end at 17.35.The Fed's quantitative easing program has supported not just the U.S. economy but overseas economies as well by increasing liquidity, so cutting the stimulus has been a big factor in the emerging markets' selloff.Stocks were lower early in the session even after bold efforts by Turkey and South Africa to stabilize their currencies.South Africa's central bank raised interest rates for the first time in six years. Its move followed a dramatic rate hike by Turkey's central bank late Tuesday, designed to defend its crumbling currency. Boeing's stock fell 5.3 percent to close at $129.78, after the aerospace and defense company issued conservative forecasts for profit and cash flow. Investors focused on those projections, though the company reported a surge in quarterly profit.Yahoo shares dropped 8.7 percent to end at $34.89, a day after the Internet company reported a drop in online ad prices that hurt its revenue for a fourth consecutive quarter.Among other profit reports, Dow Chemical Co posted a quarterly profit that was well ahead of expectations. It also raised its dividend 15 percent and expanded its stock-buyback program. Dow Chemical's stock rose 3.9 percent to end at $44.73.After the bell, shares of Facebook rose 9.2 percent to $58.45 after the world's largest social networking company reported quarterly revenue increased 63 percent.Quarterly earnings expectations for the S&P 500 have improved as more companies have reported results. Growth is now estimated at 9 percent, compared with 7.6 percent at the start of the month, Thomson Reuters data showed.As the stock market rallied last year, valuations rose for S&P 500 companies. The forward price-to-earnings ratio is at 14.9, compared with 13.1 at the start of 2013.Volume was higher than average for the month.

32,"   By Supantha Mukherjee  Facebook Inc's shares rose as much as 17 percent to a life-high after the company's resounding revenue growth underscored CEO Mark Zuckerberg's success in selling ad space on the social network's mobile app.At least 32 brokerages raised their price targets on Facebook's shares, which touched a high of $62.50 in midday trading on Thursday.If the gains hold to close, this would be the largest single-day rise in Facebook's stock since July 2013. The company would have added about $20 billion to its market capitalization of $136 billion, putting it among the top 20 in the S&P 500 index.The highest price target among the 32 brokerages was $82, which would value the world's largest social network at more than $200 billion.Facebook's fourth-quarter revenue rose to $2.585 billion from $1.585 billion in the year-ago period, beating analysts' average expectation of $2.33 billion.""After disappointing earnings from large-cap internet stocks like eBay and Yahoo, it was refreshing to see FB crush Q4 consensus estimates, with accelerating trends in its core advertising business,"" CRT Capital analyst Neil Doshi wrote.Facebook said on Wednesday revenue from mobile ads represented 53 percent of its total fourth-quarter advertising revenue, up from 49 percent in the third quarter.While the total number of ad impressions on Facebook declined 8 percent, some analysts attributed that to the company's shift to mobile and focused instead on the near-doubling of ad pricing in the last year. Macquarie (USA) Equities Research analyst Ben Schachter said Facebook had focused on improving the quality and relevance of advertisements, rather than boosting ad load, in order to drive revenue growth.Facebook's latest newsfeed ads, which inject paid marketing messages straight into a user's stream of news and content, are ideally suited for mobile screens.""We expect several more quarters ahead of expanding newsfeed ad pricing, and also suspect the ad model on Facebook will continue to evolve rapidly, leaving room for future positive surprises,"" Canaccord Genuity Michael Graham wrote.Facebook and rival Google Inc have been looking for ways to generate more revenue by harnessing the mobile platform, as more and more users rely on smartphones to access the Internet. Deutsche Bank estimated 4 billion people would be accessing the Internet on smartphones in 2017, with spending on global mobile advertisement set to reach $70 billion by the same year.GROWTH ENGINE Facebook, which completes a decade in business next week, ended 2013 with 1.23 billion monthly active users.Analysts identified the company's new photo-sharing service, Instagram, as well as a new video ad format and its social search feature, dubbed as graph search, as the next big areas of growth for Facebook. Facebook launched its first ads for Instagram during the quarter just ended, and has also started testing video ads with brand marketers.""We continue to see two major catalysts in Instagram and video ads, which could be FB's next billion-dollar business,"" Jefferies analysts wrote in a note.Wall Street has been counting on video ads to open up a potentially lucrative market as Facebook tries to sustain its rapid growth. This market is considered crucial for Facebook's market valuation, and poses a potential long-term threat to traditional TV networks.Zuckerberg has enlisted Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, Qualcomm Inc and other technology companies to help him in a project aimed at making Internet access affordable for people not already online.One area of concern to Facebook has been that teenage users might be drifting to new messaging services, such as Snapchat and WhatsApp.After spooking some investors in October by saying it had noticed a decrease in daily users among younger teens, Facebook did not disclose teen usage data for the fourth quarter.""The company's Messenger product grew users 70 percent in the last three months and we think this could potentially help re-engage teens over time,"" JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth said.(Additional reporting by Chandni Doulatramani; Editing by Robin Paxton and Saumyadeb Chakrabarty)",2014-01-30,FB,"Thu Jan 30, 2014 | 12:49pm EST",Facebook shares surge as mobile ads click,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-facebook-results-research-idUSBREA0T0V420140130?type=companyNews

35,"   By Caroline Valetkevitch | NEW YORK  NEW YORK A selloff in emerging markets sent a cold chill down Wall Street, triggering a slide on Friday and making January its worst month since May 2012 after one of its best years in more than a decade.For January, the Dow tumbled 5.3 percent and the S&P 500 slid 3.6 percent - their worst monthly percentage declines since May 2012.The January loss followed the S&P 500's gain of 30 percent in 2013 - its best year since 1997. It also marked the first time that the S&P 500 ended January with a loss since 2010, when the benchmark index started the year with a drop of 3.7 percent.In Friday's session, energy and consumer discretionary shares had the biggest declines of the day after some disappointing earnings. The S&P energy index .SPNY ended the day down 1.5 percent, while the consumer discretionary index .SPLRCD fell 1.3 percent. Chevron Corp (CVX.N) and Amazon.com (AMZN.O) were among the biggest drags.Trading was volatile during the session, with the Nasdaq briefly edging into positive territory and the CBOE Volatility Index .VIX - also known as the fear index - briefly turning negative.But selling accelerated, heading into the close. The VIX shot up 6.5 percent to end Friday's session at 18.41. For January, the VIX jumped 34 percent, its biggest monthly gain since May 2012. The fear index hasn't traded above 19 since October.""Given the concerns over the emerging markets and currencies, I think most traders are tending to close down their books so that they don't come in on Monday morning with a negative surprise,"" said Quincy Krosby, market strategist for Prudential Financial, which is based in Newark, New Jersey. Global equity markets have been rattled by the outlook for emerging markets, including slower growth in China, while the Federal Reserve's decision this week to keep withdrawing its monetary stimulus added to worries.The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI fell 149.76 points or 0.94 percent, to end at 15,698.85. The S&P 500 .SPX lost 11.60 points or 0.65 percent, to finish at 1,782.59. The Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 19.25 points or 0.47 percent, to close at 4,103.88.For January, the Nasdaq ended down 1.7 percent, its worst monthly percentage loss since October 2012.The blue-chip Dow underperformed the small-cap Russell 2000 index .TOY, which fell 2.8 percent in January, its worst month since August. For the week, the Dow fell 1.1 percent, the S&P 500 dipped 0.4 percent and the Nasdaq slipped 0.6 percent.A selloff in emerging market currencies spurred some central banks to raise interest rates or intervene in markets to limit the swings, but investors worry it may not be enough to reverse the trend. The Fed's removal of stimulus added to the concerns because the extra liquidity has helped many of those markets.Weighing on investor sentiment was data showing that inflation in the euro zone slowed this month to 0.7 percent from 0.8 percent in December. That reading confounded expectations for an increase to 0.9 percent and matched a low hit last October. The European Central Bank responded by cutting its interest rates to record lows. Among the day's biggest decliners was Amazon.com, which fell 11 percent to close at $358.69, a day after the world's biggest online retailer missed Wall Street's estimates for the crucial holiday period. Amazon also cautioned investors about a possible operating loss this quarter as shipping costs climb.Chevron's shares dropped 4.1 percent to end at $111.63, their worst daily percentage decline since October 2012, after the second-largest U.S. oil company said its fourth-quarter profit dropped 32 percent as refining margins and production fell around the world.On the plus side, Google Inc's (GOOG.O) shares added 4 percent to close at $1,180.97 after the Internet search giant reported quarterly revenue that beat Wall Street's target despite an ongoing decline in prices for its online ads and deepening losses at Motorola, the handset-making division to be sold to China's Lenovo (0992.HK).Zynga Inc (ZNGA.O) shares jumped 23.6 percent to $4.40, after the video game maker, known for its ""Farmville"" game, said late Thursday that it will cut 15 percent of its workforce.Volume was higher than the average for the month. About 7.8 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, compared with the average of 6.9 billion for this month, according to data from BATS Global Markets.Decliners outnumbered advancers on both the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq by a ratio of about 2 to 1.(Editing by Jan Paschal)",2014-01-31,FB,"Fri Jan 31, 2014 | 5:58pm EST","Big chill gives Dow, S&P worst month since May 2012",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-markets-stocks-idUSBREA080LL20140131?type=companyNews

43,"   By Supantha Mukherjee  Facebook Inc's (FB.O) shares rose as much as 17 percent to a life-high after the company's resounding revenue growth underscored CEO Mark Zuckerberg's success in selling ad space on the social network's mobile app.At least 32 brokerages raised their price targets on Facebook's shares, which touched a high of $62.50 in midday trading on Thursday.If the gains hold to close, this would be the largest single-day rise in Facebook's stock since July 2013. The company would have added about $20 billion to its market capitalization of $136 billion, putting it among the top 20 in the S&P 500 index .SPX.The highest price target among the 32 brokerages was $82, which would value the world's largest social network at more than $200 billion.Facebook's fourth-quarter revenue rose to $2.585 billion from $1.585 billion in the year-ago period, beating analysts' average expectation of $2.33 billion.""After disappointing earnings from large-cap internet stocks like eBay and Yahoo, it was refreshing to see FB crush Q4 consensus estimates, with accelerating trends in its core advertising business,"" CRT Capital analyst Neil Doshi wrote.Facebook said on Wednesday revenue from mobile ads represented 53 percent of its total fourth-quarter advertising revenue, up from 49 percent in the third quarter.While the total number of ad impressions on Facebook declined 8 percent, some analysts attributed that to the company's shift to mobile and focused instead on the near-doubling of ad pricing in the last year. Macquarie (USA) Equities Research analyst Ben Schachter said Facebook had focused on improving the quality and relevance of advertisements, rather than boosting ad load, in order to drive revenue growth.Facebook's latest newsfeed ads, which inject paid marketing messages straight into a user's stream of news and content, are ideally suited for mobile screens.""We expect several more quarters ahead of expanding newsfeed ad pricing, and also suspect the ad model on Facebook will continue to evolve rapidly, leaving room for future positive surprises,"" Canaccord Genuity Michael Graham wrote.Facebook and rival Google Inc (GOOG.O) have been looking for ways to generate more revenue by harnessing the mobile platform, as more and more users rely on smartphones to access the Internet. Deutsche Bank estimated 4 billion people would be accessing the Internet on smartphones in 2017, with spending on global mobile advertisement set to reach $70 billion by the same year.GROWTH ENGINE Facebook, which completes a decade in business next week, ended 2013 with 1.23 billion monthly active users.Analysts identified the company's new photo-sharing service, Instagram, as well as a new video ad format and its social search feature, dubbed as graph search, as the next big areas of growth for Facebook. Facebook launched its first ads for Instagram during the quarter just ended, and has also started testing video ads with brand marketers.""We continue to see two major catalysts in Instagram and video ads, which could be FB's next billion-dollar business,"" Jefferies analysts wrote in a note.Wall Street has been counting on video ads to open up a potentially lucrative market as Facebook tries to sustain its rapid growth. This market is considered crucial for Facebook's market valuation, and poses a potential long-term threat to traditional TV networks.Zuckerberg has enlisted Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS), Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) and other technology companies to help him in a project aimed at making Internet access affordable for people not already online.One area of concern to Facebook has been that teenage users might be drifting to new messaging services, such as Snapchat and WhatsApp.After spooking some investors in October by saying it had noticed a decrease in daily users among younger teens, Facebook did not disclose teen usage data for the fourth quarter.""The company's Messenger product grew users 70 percent in the last three months and we think this could potentially help re-engage teens over time,"" JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth said.(Additional reporting by Chandni Doulatramani; Editing by Robin Paxton and Saumyadeb Chakrabarty)",2014-01-31,FB,"Thu Jan 30, 2014 | 8:20pm EST",Facebook shares surge as mobile ads click,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-facebook-results-research-idUSBREA0T0V420140131?type=companyNews

46,"   By Angela Moon | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Popular stocks like Amazon, Facebook and Best Buy surprised investors with huge post-earnings swings this quarter - and some of them headed south fast - a big jolt for the market after 2013 saw many companies' shares rally with nary an interruption.Investors have started to bet on big swings in other normally volatile stocks of companies due to report results in coming days, including Tesla Motors (TSLA.O), Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) and Green Mountain Coffee Roasters GMCR.O.But there is still a lot of room for shocks in the next few weeks. In many cases, the expectations for share volatility remains lower than the actual moves in such hot stocks in previous quarters.""It's been a stellar couple of weeks for volatility players after a quiet 2013. The overall market has seen volatility grow substantially,"" said Randy Frederick, director of trading and derivatives at the Charles Schwab Center for Financial Research in Austin, Texas.Best Buy (BBY.N) started the trend for this quarter's reporting period. After ending the year as the S&P 500's second best performer behind only Netflix (NFLX.O), shares stumbled 29 percent on January 16 after reporting unexpectedly weak holiday sales. Amazon (AMZN.O) followed later with an 11 percent decline following its disappointing results.Even those that did well have surprised investors with the magnitude of the moves - Netflix rose 16.5 percent on January 23 after its results and Facebook Inc (FB.O) rose 14.1 percent on January 30 following earnings.Reflecting such caution, implied volatility for stocks of high-profile companies due to report in the next two weeks has risen in the last few days. ""We've been seeing a lot of movements this season and people might be on the edge and inclined to sell off more sharply. It's probably a wise idea to hedge a little more,"" said Rick Meckler, president of investment firm LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey.Expectations for Green Mountain Coffee Roasters is for a 15 percent move in shares post-earnings, but that's less than the average move of 25 percent in the past eight quarters, according to Goldman Sachs data.The implied move on Tesla Motors (TSLA.O) options is about $8.40, about 3 percent up or down, as the luxury electric auto maker is due to report its earnings later this month. Over the past eight quarters, Tesla's average move has been 10 percent.Other notable companies in the social media and Internet space, including Groupon, Expedia Inc (EXPE.O) and Yelp Inc (YELP.N) are currently pricing in post-earnings moves about on a par with recent activity, according to Goldman. While some stock investors may be thrown for a loop, the larger-than-expected swings have been great for options traders who bet on volatility, no matter whether the stock goes up or down.TWITTER'S FIRST EARNINGS DANCE Social media play Twitter Inc TWTR.O, which went public with much fanfare in November, has some investors betting on more volatility. Demand for short-term options contracts, mainly used to react to events like earnings, has soared ahead of its results after the bell on Wednesday. In its short life as a public company Twitter has already seen 17 trading sessions where it gained or lost more than 5 percent.The expected post-earnings move is currently about $9.70, or about 14.5 percent up or down, an expectation that has been creeping up in the last two weeks.""The fear of the unknown is particularly high for stocks of companies with no or a limited track record because you can't really draw a comparison to their peers or history. It's harder to have a view on how earnings will come out,"" said JJ Kinahan, chief strategist at TD Ameritrade.Adding to volatility, short interest in Twitter surged to 33 million shares in January, more than 10 percent of the stock's available float.Some bold bets were seen in the options market with traders buying and selling out-of-the-money strikes - options contracts with prices far away from the current price.Top open interest positions in Twitter options ranged from $85 weekly strikes that expire on Friday, along with $47 out-of-the-money puts that expire on Feb 14. Even the most actively traded near-term strikes are well out of the money - February $75 and March $75 calls.

The company said it worked with a leading group of gay and transgender advocacy organizations to come up with the selection of identity options.Until now, Facebook's 1.23 billion members could only select male or female for their genders, which Facebook requires users to state in their profiles. Users of rival Google Inc's Google+ social network already had an ""other"" option for gender. Facebook said users also can control the audience who can view a custom choice, noting the challenges that some people may face in publicly sharing their gender identity.Users can also choose the personal pronoun to which they are referred publicly.

52,"   By Noel Randewich | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Graphics chipmaker Nvidia Corp has halted plans to build a flashy new campus that could have rivaled the architectural ambitions of major Silicon Valley neighbors like Facebook Inc and Apple Inc.Nvidia said a year ago it would use property it owns across the street from its current headquarters in Santa Clara, California, to construct one, and eventually two, eco-friendly buildings in the shape of triangles. The triangle is a basic building block in video game graphics.But Chief Executive Jen-Hsun Huang said on Wednesday that Nvidia put the project on hold after leasing office space late last year in a existing building by its headquarters.""We will absolutely need a new campus eventually. In the short term, with this new facility, we're in pretty good shape,"" Huang said in an interview.Earlier on Wednesday, Nvidia posted higher fiscal fourth-quarter revenue that beat Wall Street's expectations, fueled by the chipmaker's PC gaming components, even as it grapples with an expansion beyond computers and into mobile devices.When Nvidia unveiled plans for its new campus a year ago, Huang wrote a blogpost showing off images of buildings with vast open floors optimized for ""cross-functional work,"" with skylights in the shape of criss-crossed triangles taking up almost all of the buildings' roofs.Nvidia has been just one of many Silicon Valley tech companies to plan major headquarter improvements in recent years. Apple has been planning a massive new, ring-shaped structure near its Cupertino headquarters, while Facebook intends to expand its campus in Menlo Park, with the roofs of buildings doubling as park space in a project the size of 7-1/2 football fields.Nvidia's decision not to launch into its construction project shows prudent restraint on the part of Huang, said RBC analyst Doug Freedman.The company has about 3,300 employees at its headquarters, some of whom have already moved into the newly leased building.""I like the fact they're not building a new campus. It's almost historically been a great investment short indicator when a company goes out and builds itself a new campus,"" Freedman said. ""It distracts management's attention from the issues that allowed them to build the campus."" Nvidia is at a critical juncture. With the personal computer industry losing steam, Nvidia has expanded its graphics expertise into mobile devices. But it is meeting stiff competition from larger Qualcomm Inc and has responded by increasing its focus on automotive markets and other areas.Nvidia's results in the fourth quarter, which ended on January 26, reflected better-than-expected sales of high-end graphics chips popular with game enthusiasts. That niche has suffered less than mainstream laptops from consumers' growing preferences for tablets. The company's revenue forecast for the first quarter was also above analysts' expectations.""The graphics market has been fairly resilient, even in the face of poor PC sales,"" said Evercore analyst Patrick Wang. ""Folks still buy graphics cards to play games.""Nvidia has struggled to convince manufacturers to use its Tegra chips in tablets and smartphones. In the fourth quarter, revenue from Nvidia's Tegra mobile chip business fell 37 percent while revenue from its PC graphics processor business rose 14 percent. The company is increasingly marketing the Tegra line of chips as ideal for powering entertainment and navigation systems in cars. In January, Nvidia said it was broadening its relationship with Audi, which plans to use the upcoming Tegra K1 chip in more of its cars.Nvidia said that during the quarter, it had lower sales of Tegra chips for smartphones and tablets while increasing its sales of Tegra chips for cars.Overall, Nvidia's fourth-quarter revenue rose to $1.14 billion, up 3 percent from the year-ago period. It said revenue in the first quarter would be $1.05 billion, plus or minus 2 percent.Analysts on average had expected fourth-quarter revenue of $1.053 billion and first-quarter revenue of $1 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Net income was $147 million, or 25 cents a share, in the fourth quarter ended on January 26, compared with $174 million or 28 cents a share in the year-ago quarter. Non-GAAP earnings per share in the fourth quarter were 32 cents.Nvidia shares rose 3 percent in extended trading on Wednesday after closing up 3.6 percent at $16.83 on Nasdaq.(Additional reporting by Malathi Nayak; Editing by Matthew Lewis and Richard Chang)",2014-02-13,FB,"Wed Feb 12, 2014 | 8:33pm EST",Nvidia puts plans for new Silicon Valley campus on hold,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-nvidia-results-idUSBREA1B2AW20140213?type=companyNews

In the short term, with this new facility, we're in pretty good shape,"" Huang said in an interview. Earlier on Wednesday, Nvidia posted higher fiscal fourth-quarter revenue that beat Wall Street's expectations, fueled by the chipmaker's PC gaming components, even as it grapples with an expansion beyond computers and into mobile devices.When Nvidia unveiled plans for its new campus a year ago, Huang wrote a blogpost showing off images of buildings with vast open floors optimized for ""cross-functional work,"" with skylights in the shape of criss-crossed triangles taking up almost all of the buildings' roofs.Nvidia has been just one of many Silicon Valley tech companies to plan major headquarter improvements in recent years.Apple has been planning a massive new, ring-shaped structure near its Cupertino headquarters, while Facebook intends to expand its campus in Menlo Park, with the roofs of buildings doubling as park space in a project the size of 7-1/2 football fields.Nvidia's decision not to launch into its construction project shows prudent restraint on the part of Huang, said RBC analyst Doug Freedman. The company has about 3,300 employees at its headquarters, some of whom have already moved into the newly leased building.""I like the fact they're not building a new campus. It's almost historically been a great investment short indicator when a company goes out and builds itself a new campus,"" Freedman said. ""It distracts management's attention from the issues that allowed them to build the campus.""Nvidia is at a critical juncture. With the personal computer industry losing steam, Nvidia has expanded its graphics expertise into mobile devices. But it is meeting stiff competition from larger Qualcomm Inc and has responded by increasing its focus on automotive markets and other areas.Nvidia's results in the fourth quarter, which ended on Jan. 26, reflected better-than-expected sales of high-end graphics chips popular with game enthusiasts. That niche has suffered less than mainstream laptops from consumers' growing preferences for tablets. The company's revenue forecast for the first quarter was also above analysts' expectations. ""The graphics market has been fairly resilient, even in the face of poor PC sales,"" said Evercore analyst Patrick Wang. ""Folks still buy graphics cards to play games.""Nvidia has struggled to convince manufacturers to use its Tegra chips in tablets and smartphones. In the fourth quarter, revenue from Nvidia's Tegra mobile chip business fell 37 percent while revenue from its PC graphics processor business rose 14 percent.The company is increasingly marketing the Tegra line of chips as ideal for powering entertainment and navigation systems in cars. In January, Nvidia said it was broadening its relationship with Audi, which plans to use the upcoming Tegra K1 chip in more of its cars.Nvidia said that during the quarter, it had lower sales of Tegra chips for smartphones and tablets while increasing its sales of Tegra chips for cars.Overall, Nvidia's fourth-quarter revenue rose to $1.14 billion, up 3 percent from the year-ago period. It said revenue in the first quarter would be $1.05 billion, plus or minus 2 percent.Analysts on average had expected fourth-quarter revenue of $1.053 billion and first-quarter revenue of $1 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Net income was $147 million, or 25 cents a share, in the fourth quarter ended on Jan. 26, compared with $174 million or 28 cents a share in the year-ago quarter. Non-GAAP earnings per share in the fourth quarter were 32 cents.Nvidia shares rose 3 percent in extended trading on Wednesday after closing up 3.6 percent at $16.83 on Nasdaq.",2014-02-13,FB,"Wed Feb 12, 2014 | 8:33pm EST",UPDATE 3-Nvidia puts plans for new Silicon Valley campus on hold,http://www.reuters.com//article/nvidia-results-idUSL2N0LH22Q20140213?type=companyNews

58,"   By Jeremy Wagstaff  Asian chat services KakaoTalk, LINE and WeChat threaten to overturn the mobile order of things, usurping the role of Google Inc, Apple Inc, Amazon.com Inc, Facebook Inc and telecoms carriers as gatekeeper to the consumer.Where these internet and telecoms giants once controlled the lucrative choke points of the industry, social messaging services are fast emerging as an alternative distribution channel for adverts, apps, and goods and services.For example, Tencent Holdings' WeChat allows its more than 270 million active users to book taxis, top up phone credit, and even invest in wealth management products, while Naver Corp's LINE recently launched flash sales via its app in Thailand, with more than 5 million users signing up to buy L'Oreal lipstick and other products.The growing role of such apps as distribution channels was acknowledged by Japanese billionaire Hiroshi Mikitani when he explained why his company Rakuten Inc bought messaging company Viber last week for $900 million. ""In some smaller emerging markets, it was very difficult for Rakuten to go in because of the lack of scale or distribution infrastructure. But after the acquisition of Viber we can now go into those markets with our digital businesses.""MAKING MONEY At the heart of the battle is how to make money from the world's billions of mobile phone users.Traditionally, it was carriers who took in the revenue from voice and SMS messages - and more recently from internet usage. Income, however, has been hurt by so-called over-the-top players such as Google and Facebook, who make most of their money from advertising.Then there are the app stores, where users find and download apps. Although many of these are free, users are encouraged to add features which they pay for within the application. Google's Play store and Apple's App Store, the two largest, deliver these apps and handle all payments, taking a 30 percent cut along the way, some of which they may split with the carrier. In some countries, other app stores dominate, particularly China, where Google doesn't operate its online store.These platforms are not only a source of revenue, but also effectively control access to the end-user. Apple said users spent $10 billion on its App Store last year.But the growing popularity of mobile messaging apps is changing this.More than half of all smartphone users are active users of such apps, according to Analysys Mason, and the volume of messages has already overtaken traditional SMS short messages, and will double again this year.Riding this wave are dozens of companies peddling mobile messaging apps, with some able to gather a critical mass of 100 million users or more. By offering compelling mixes of chat, downloadable icons and games, LINE, KakaoTalk and WeChat have emerged as some of the most popular in Asia. Now these apps are leveraging their networks to become gatekeepers of their own. Take South Korea, for example. In Google's app store there seven of the top-10 grossing apps are Kakao-branded, according to App Annie, a company that measures app usage. Kakao promotes them to users of its apps and takes a cut from the developer. While Google and the carriers get their 30 percent, Kakao takes another 21 percent. With KakaoTalk on around nine of every 10 South Korean smartphones, it's an easy, albeit costly, way for game developers to be noticed.WeChat, or ""Weixin"" in China, meanwhile, has taken its home market by storm, and Shenzhen-based Tencent is throwing itself into monetizing the app, going well beyond selling users emoticons - called stickers - and extra lives for games and into e-commerce and banking.When WeChat let users send traditional Chinese New Year gifts of money through their smartphones, a survey by market research firm Ebrun this month found it had been key in users adopting WeChat's payment service: 74 percent of users surveyed had connected their bank account to their WeChat profile.""This is really exciting,"" says Bertrand Schmitt, Beijing-based CEO of App Annie. ""It's like building a new platform on top of platforms.""BIG AT HOME, BUT ... To be sure, none of these companies is about to seriously challenge the big players. All three dominate at home - LINE in Japan, KakaoTalk in Korea and WeChat in China - but are still battling to win the same degree of loyalty in other markets.A survey by OnDevice, a mobile market researcher, showed WeChat was installed on most respondents' devices in China, but LINE was on only 5 percent and KakaoTalk on only 3 percent. Tencent owns 13 percent of KakaoTalk owner Kakao. None of these services was on more than 10 percent of devices in the United States. Outside China, all three need to work for now with Apple and Google.""I don't think they threaten app stores and operating systems, not yet anyway,"" said Sameer Singh, an analyst based in Hyderabad, ""because the platform owner still retains control over developer activity.""Nevertheless, those watching the shift see it as just the latest in a series of disruptions.""This is why Microsoft feared Netscape, why Facebook feared Instagram, why AT&T lost to Apple, and why Apple was worried about Google Maps: in each case a platform was inserting itself between the existing platform layer and the users,"" said Marshall Van Alstyne of Boston University.""Once it spreads widely enough, it controls the interaction and becomes the strategic bottleneck. The social networking sites are in a strong position to do this with respect to other platforms. If you can control that user interaction, you can control the revenue streams.""In most Asian countries, the mobile phone has been most people's main, if not first, internet device. And in China, local players quickly filled the void left by Google to build app stores and payment mechanisms on phones running Google's Android operating system. ""All the markets outside the West are experimenting with this and perfecting this,"" said Dmitry Levit, an investor in social messaging service mig33, which recently listed in Australia through a reverse takeover.""North Asia just created a perfect storm of a vast, relatively young population, a little bit of expendable income that is perfectly fine for a few sticker packs and relatively well distributed payment systems,"" he said.DISRUPTERS DISRUPTED? Beyond North Asia everything is still up for grabs.LINE and WeChat are investing heavily in marketing to push beyond their strongholds. LINE said its marketing expenses more than trebled year-on-year in the last quarter and are likely to remain at similar levels this year.Getting users to install the app is one thing. Monetizing is another.

59,"   By Jeremy Wagstaff  Feb 19 Asian chat services KakaoTalk, LINE and WeChat threaten to overturn the mobile order of things, usurping the role of Google Inc, Apple Inc, Amazon.com Inc, Facebook Inc and telecoms carriers as gatekeeper to the consumer.Where these internet and telecoms giants once controlled the lucrative choke points of the industry, social messaging services are fast emerging as an alternative distribution channel for adverts, apps, and goods and services.For example, Tencent Holdings' WeChat allows its more than 270 million active users to book taxis, top up phone credit, and even invest in wealth management products, while Naver Corp's LINE recently launched flash sales via its app in Thailand, with more than 5 million users signing up to buy L'Oreal lipstick and other products.The growing role of such apps as distribution channels was acknowledged by Japanese billionaire Hiroshi Mikitani when he explained why his company Rakuten Inc bought messaging company Viber last week for $900 million. ""In some smaller emerging markets, it was very difficult for Rakuten to go in because of the lack of scale or distribution infrastructure. But after the acquisition of Viber we can now go into those markets with our digital businesses.""MAKING MONEY At the heart of the battle is how to make money from the world's billions of mobile phone users.Traditionally, it was carriers who took in the revenue from voice and SMS messages - and more recently from internet usage. Income, however, has been hurt by so-called over-the-top players such as Google and Facebook, who make most of their money from advertising.Then there are the app stores, where users find and download apps. Although many of these are free, users are encouraged to add features which they pay for within the application. Google's Play store and Apple's App Store, the two largest, deliver these apps and handle all payments, taking a 30 percent cut along the way, some of which they may split with the carrier. In some countries, other app stores dominate, particularly China, where Google doesn't operate its online store.These platforms are not only a source of revenue, but also effectively control access to the end-user. Apple said users spent $10 billion on its App Store last year.But the growing popularity of mobile messaging apps is changing this.More than half of all smartphone users are active users of such apps, according to Analysys Mason, and the volume of messages has already overtaken traditional SMS short messages, and will double again this year. Riding this wave are dozens of companies peddling mobile messaging apps, with some able to gather a critical mass of 100 million users or more. By offering compelling mixes of chat, downloadable icons and games, LINE, KakaoTalk and WeChat have emerged as some of the most popular in Asia. Now these apps are leveraging their networks to become gatekeepers of their own.Take South Korea, for example. In Google's app store there seven of the top-10 grossing apps are Kakao-branded, according to App Annie, a company that measures app usage. Kakao promotes them to users of its apps and takes a cut from the developer. While Google and the carriers get their 30 percent, Kakao takes another 21 percent. With KakaoTalk on around nine of every 10 South Korean smartphones, it's an easy, albeit costly, way for game developers to be noticed.WeChat, or ""Weixin"" in China, meanwhile, has taken its home market by storm, and Shenzhen-based Tencent is throwing itself into monetising the app, going well beyond selling users emoticons - called stickers - and extra lives for games and into e-commerce and banking.When WeChat let users send traditional Chinese New Year gifts of money through their smartphones, a survey by market research firm Ebrun this month found it had been key in users adopting WeChat's payment service: 74 percent of users surveyed had connected their bank account to their WeChat profile.""This is really exciting,"" says Bertrand Schmitt, Beijing-based CEO of App Annie. ""It's like building a new platform on top of platforms.""BIG AT HOME, BUT ...  To be sure, none of these companies is about to seriously challenge the big players. All three dominate at home - LINE in Japan, KakaoTalk in Korea and WeChat in China - but are still battling to win the same degree of loyalty in other markets.A survey by OnDevice, a mobile market researcher, showed WeChat was installed on most respondents' devices in China, but LINE was on only 5 percent and KakaoTalk on only 3 percent. Tencent owns 13 percent of KakaoTalk owner Kakao. None of these services was on more than 10 percent of devices in the United States.Outside China, all three need to work for now with Apple and Google.""I don't think they threaten app stores and operating systems, not yet anyway,"" said Sameer Singh, an analyst based in Hyderabad, ""because the platform owner still retains control over developer activity.""Nevertheless, those watching the shift see it as just the latest in a series of disruptions.""This is why Microsoft feared Netscape, why Facebook feared Instagram, why AT&T lost to Apple, and why Apple was worried about Google Maps: in each case a platform was inserting itself between the existing platform layer and the users,"" said Marshall Van Alstyne of Boston University.""Once it spreads widely enough, it controls the interaction and becomes the strategic bottleneck. The social networking sites are in a strong position to do this with respect to other platforms. If you can control that user interaction, you can control the revenue streams."" In most Asian countries, the mobile phone has been most people's main, if not first, internet device. And in China, local players quickly filled the void left by Google to build app stores and payment mechanisms on phones running Google's Android operating system.""All the markets outside the West are experimenting with this and perfecting this,"" said Dmitry Levit, an investor in social messaging service mig33, which recently listed in Australia through a reverse takeover.""North Asia just created a perfect storm of a vast, relatively young population, a little bit of expendable income that is perfectly fine for a few sticker packs and relatively well distributed payment systems,"" he said.DISRUPTERS DISRUPTED? Beyond North Asia everything is still up for grabs.LINE and WeChat are investing heavily in marketing to push beyond their strongholds. LINE said its marketing expenses more than trebled year-on-year in the last quarter and are likely to remain at similar levels this year.Getting users to install the app is one thing. Monetising is another. The emerging markets of South and Southeast Asia lack easy and cheap ways to make small payments over the phone, something all messenger players are going to have to figure out, probably through deals with operators.""It took us more than 5 years to charge users on prepaid cards,"" said Thomas Clayton, Singapore-based CEO of Bubbly, a social network that focuses on getting celebrities to use the service as a promotional tool.

""I think the rally that we've seen off the 1,750 low (on the S&P 500) was largely driven by the sense the Fed is going to slow down their retracement if it's necessary,"" said Uri Landesman, president of Platinum Partners in New York.""Anything that puts a crimp in that belief is going to scare this market,"" he said.

The weather was also largely blamed for the sharp slowdown in hiring in December. Some economists, however, lowered their first-quarter growth estimates on the back of the weak housing starts data.

66,"   By Soham Chatterjee and Saqib Iqbal Ahmed  Facebook Inc's purchase of fast-growing messaging startup WhatsApp for an eye-popping $19 billion largely won approval from analysts, who said the deal made strategic sense as it will solidify the social network's position as a leader in mobile.Facebook shares closed up 2.3 percent at $69.63 after falling as much as 3 percent in early trading as investors got over the initial sticker shock of the deal value.At least two brokerages downgraded their recommendations on Facebook to ""hold"" but the overwhelming majority of analysts remain positive on the stock.Facebook is paying more than double its annual revenue for a chat program that has little revenue. The purchase price is slightly more than the market value of Sony Corp.But analysts noted that WhatsApp has over 450 million users and boasts a higher level of engagement than Facebook.""Facebook is the leading global social-sharing utility. Now, it has a significant opportunity to be the leading global communications utility,"" RBC Capital Markets said in a note.WhatsApp is much stronger than Facebook Messenger in Europe, Latin America, Africa and Australia and has attracted users at a time when it appears that young people are turning away from Facebook.Analysts said the price tag for WhatsApp, founded in 2009 by former Yahoo Inc employees Jan Koum and Brian Acton, seemed reasonable from the point of view of value per user. Facebook is paying $42 per user, compared with a market value per user of $170 for Facebook and $212 for Twitter, Deutsche Bank's Ross Sandler said.WhatsApp's user base is less than half that of Facebook's 1.2 billion but the chat program's users are more active. On any given day, 70 percent of WhatsApp users are active, compared with 62 percent for Facebook. WhatsApp's users are expected to reach 1 billion by 2015, according to many analysts.""Looking past the sticker shock of $19 billion ... We view (the deal) as an offensive move to gain additional share of the consumer's time spent,"" Credit Suisse analysts said, noting that Facebook was paying about 11 percent of its market value to gain a 30 percent rise in engagement.HAVE SCALE, WILL MAKE MONEY Of the 44 analysts who cover Facebook, 37 have a ""buy"" or a ""strong buy"" rating on the stock, according to Thomson Reuters data. None has a ""sell"" rating. Analysts have commended Facebook's ability to make money from its mobile app. Now they will want to see how it will earn money from the chat app's huge number of users.""While we don't expect messaging to be a meaningful near-term or even long-term revenue driver, the real value could be the evolution of the platform to incorporate new functionality such as payments, app distribution, social features ...,"" Macquarie Equities Research analyst Ben Schachter said.Facebook has fallen behind in mobile phone messaging apps in emerging markets, where many are accessing the Internet on fast-growing 3G mobile networks for the first time on smartphones.Asian rivals such as Tencent Holdings Ltd's WeChat, Naver Corp's Line and Rakuten Inc's Viber are well ahead of Facebook messenger across much of Asia. Facebook has been buying apps with large numbers of young users as part of Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg's strategy of helping users share any kind of content with anyone.The company's $1 billion deal to buy photo-sharing application Instagram in 2012 and its recent $3 billion failed overture to buy SnapChat - used by teenagers to send texts and photos that disappear after a few seconds - followed unsuccessful attempts to develop rival apps.""Large-scale networks like WhatsApp are rare and provide (a) significant monetization opportunity (i.e. YouTube) justifying valuation over time,"" SunTrust Robinson Humphrey's Robert Peck said in a note.Analysts estimate WhatsApp users share 19 billion messages, 600 million photos, 200 million voice messages, and 100 million video messages per day.Still, some analysts said Facebook was paying a high price to keep WhatsApp from being snapped up by a rival such as Google Inc.""Facebook shares would have been pressured by more than single-digit percentages in after-market trading if Google had purchased WhatsApp instead,"" Stifel analyst Jordan Rohan said in a note.Pivotal Research's Brian Wieser, who downgraded his rating on Facebook shares to ""hold"" from ""buy,"" said he expects Facebook shares to face pressure in the near-term as investors come to terms with the risk of future acquisitions.(Reporting by Soham Chatterjee and Saqib Iqbal Ahmed in Bangalore; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty and Lisa Shumaker)",2014-02-20,FB,"Thu Feb 20, 2014 | 4:39pm EST",Wall Street sees sense in Facebook's $19 billion WhatsApp buy,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-whatsapp-facebook-research-idUSBREA1J14A20140220?type=companyNews

71,"   By Gerry Shih and Sarah McBride  Facebook Inc will buy fast-growing mobile-messaging startup WhatsApp for $19 billion in cash and stock in a landmark deal that places the world's largest social network closer to the heart of mobile communications and may bring younger users into the fold.The transaction involves $4 billion in cash, $12 billion in stock and $3 billion in restricted stock that vests over several years. The WhatsApp deal is worth more than Facebook raised in its own IPO and underscores the social network's determination to win the market for messaging.Founded by a Ukrainian immigrant who dropped out of college, Jan Koum, and a Stanford alumnus, Brian Acton, WhatsApp is a Silicon Valley startup fairy tale, rocketing to 450 million users in five years and adding another million daily.""No one in the history of the world has ever done something like this,"" Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said on a conference call on Wednesday.Zuckerberg, who famously closed a $1 billion deal to buy photo-sharing service Instagram over a weekend in mid-2012, revealed on Wednesday that he proposed the tie-up over dinner with CEO Koum just 10 days earlier, on the night of February 9.WhatsApp was the leader among a wave of smartphone-based messaging apps that are now sweeping across North America, Asia and Europe. Although WhatsApp has adhered strictly to its core functionality of mimicking texting, other apps, such as Line in Japan or Tencent Holdings Ltd's WeChat, offer games or even e-commerce on top of their popular messaging features.The deal provides Facebook entree to new users, including teens who eschew the mainstream social networks but prefer WhatsApp and rivals, which have exploded in size as private messaging takes off.""People are calling them 'Facebook Nevers,'"" said Jeremy Liew, a partner at Lightspeed and an early investor in Snapchat.How the service will pay for itself is not yet clear. Zuckerberg and Koum on the conference call did not say how the company would make money beyond a $1 annual fee, which is not charged for the first year. ""The right strategy is to continue to focus on growth and product,"" Zuckerberg said.Zuckerberg and Koum said that WhatsApp will continue to operate independently, and promised to continue its policy of no advertising.""Communication is the one thing that you have to use daily, and it has a strong network effect,"" said Jonathan Teo, an early investor in Snapchat, another red-hot messaging company that flirted year ago with a multibillion dollar acquisition offer from Facebook.""Facebook is more about content and has not yet fully figured out communication."" PRICE TAG Even so, many balked at the price tag.Facebook is paying $42 per user with the deal, dwarfing its own $33 per user cost of acquiring Instagram. By comparison, Japanese e-commerce giant Rakuten just bought messaging service Viber for $3 per user, in a $900 million deal.Rick Summer, an analyst with Morningstar, warned that while investors may welcome the addition of such a high-growth asset, it may point to an inherent weakness in the social networking company that has seen growth slow in recent quarters.""This is a tacit admission that Facebook can't do things that other networks are doing,"" he said, pointing to the fact that Facebook had photo-sharing and messaging before it bought Instagram and WhatsApp. ""They can't replicate what other companies are doing so they go out and buy them. That's not all together encouraging necessarily and I think deals like these won't be the last one and that is something for investors to consider.""Venture capitalist Sequoia Capital, which invested in WhatsApp in February 2011 and led three rounds of financing altogether, holds a stake worth roughly $3 billion of the $19 billion valuation, according to people familiar with the matter.""Goodness gracious, it's a good deal for WhatsApp,"" said Teo, the early investor in Snapchat.Facebook pledged a break-up fee of $1 billion in cash and $1 billion in stock if the deal falls through.Facebook was advised by Allen & Co, while WhatsApp has enlisted Morgan Stanley for the deal.Shares in Facebook slid 2.5 percent to $66.36 after hours, from a close of $68.06 on the Nasdaq.""No matter how you look at it this is an expensive deal and a very big bet and very big bets either work out or they perform quite poorly,"" Summer said. ""Given the relative size, the enterprise valuations this is a very significant deal and it may not be the last one.""(Reporting by Garry Shih and Sarah McBride in San Francisco; Additional reporting by Soham Chatterjee in Bangalore, writing by Edwin Chan, Editing by Savio D'Souza, Andrew Hay, Peter Henderson and Lisa Shumaker)",2014-02-20,FB,"Thu Feb 20, 2014 | 8:36am EST",Facebook to buy WhatsApp for $19 billion in deal shocker,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-whatsapp-facebook-idUSBREA1I26B20140220?type=companyNews

74,"   By Molly Hensley-Clancy | NEW YORK  NEW YORK What in the world is WhatsApp?The online messaging platform has been catching on for a few years with younger users and international sets of friends, but a much larger audience noticed it on Wednesday, when Facebook Inc said it had agreed to pay $19 billion for the service.It is a phone and mobile device app to send text, video and picture messages, and 450 million people use it monthly, some 200 million more than Twitter, according to numbers from the companies.And it's adding a million users daily, which caught Facebook's eye. WhatsApp works across different types of phones, across borders, and without ads. Unlike texts, there is no per-message charge, and there is no fee for international messages, which has helped make it popular outside the United States; WhatsApp charges a 99 cent annual subscription fee, which is waived for the first year.Customers download the app, type in their phone number, and verify with a code sent by text. While WhatsApp encrypts communication and does not store messages on its computers, satisfying some privacy concerns, it also prompts new users to allow the app access their address books, prompting another set of privacy issues.WhatsApp faces a number of rivals, including Rakuten Inc's Viber, Naver Corp's Line and Tencent Holdings Ltd's WeChat. All are popular among young people, a demographic that Facebook has been losing out on in recent years and that are likely part of the draw for the company's purchase. While kids may love the messaging, not all parents do. Mobile messaging is much more difficult for parents to monitor than Facebook, for instance, which has created new worries.WhatsApp and Facebook both say the messaging service will maintain its independence once the deal goes through.(Editing by Peter Henderson)",2014-02-21,FB,"Fri Feb 21, 2014 | 7:10am EST","What's WhatsApp?

75,"  By Sarah McBrideSAN FRANCISCO Feb 20 Shortly after moving to Silicon Valley in 2004, the young Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg pulled a prank on Sequoia Capital by making an investment pitch in his pajamas.The discussion never got serious, and Sequoia never invested in Facebook. But now, Sequoia is getting the last laugh.With the sale of its protégé company message service WhatsApp to Zuckerberg's Facebook for $19 billion, Sequoia found a way to make money from Facebook as well as solidifying its position as a titan of venture capital. And it establishes partner Jim Goetz, who landed the deal, as one of Silicon Valley's top rainmakers.""This would make a lot more founders want to work with Jim Goetz,"" said Sam Altman, a partner at Y Combinator, a program for start-up companies whose previous startup was backed by Sequoia.In a business where top firms come and go, Sequoia has proved remarkably tenacious. Its big wins take on particular significance in an era when venture firms must beat back challenges from individual investors known as ""angels"" and crowdfunding; new technology that makes early-stage investments less crucial than they once were; and critics who say that venture capital investments aren't worth the trouble.Facebook announced the acquisition deal on Thursday, astounding many with the price it paid for the service, which has 450 million users and is growing at 1 million a day.Sequoia, which invested $60 million and made around $3 billion from WhatsApp, according to a source familiar with the situation, has squeezed a considerable sum out of Facebook , even if it never did invest in the social-media behemoth. Sequoia also backed photo-sharing service Instagram, which Facebook bought in 2012 for $1.01 billion. By contrast, Accel Partners, the biggest venture investor in Facebook, held $7.64 billion worth of Facebook shares at the time of that company's 2012 IPO.Launched in 1972 by Don Valentine, a founder of National Semicondutor, Sequoia was one of the nation's earliest venture-capital firms. As most others of the earlier generation faded from the scene, Sequoia held its own, going on to fund companies including Apple Inc, Oracle Corp, Paypal, and Google Inc.Today, it is involved with many of the hottest startups, including accommodation service Airbnb, file-sharing service Dropbox, invitation service Eventbrite, and stereo and bluetooth headset maker Jawbone.""We were so excited to meet with them,"" said David Rusenko, co-founder of web-hosting service Weebly, recalling his early interactions with Sequoia before the firm invested in his company three years ago. ""Sequoia is the gold standard, as far as we were concerned.""Of course, not everyone holds that view. Silicon Valley impresario Sean Parker, for example, blamed Sequoia for contributing to the downfall of his online-address book company, Plaxo, after he was forced out. Others complain the company is too hard-nosed when it comes to negotiating. And it has missed out on some big success stories, such as Twitter. But among start-ups, the firm holds a reputation for being ahead of the curve on business. For example, Sequoia nudged its portfolio companies to embrace mobile more forcefully and earlier than other venture firms, Rusenko said.He and other founders say that the firm, based on Silicon Valley's legendary Sand Hill Road, is adept at competing with other venture capitalists when a start-up is seeking funds. It also excels at courting companies that aren't actively seeking funding and persuading them to take it - like WhatsApp.""The notion of them marching up and down Sand Hill with a Powerpoint deck is comical,"" Goetz told Reuters, referring to WhatsApp founders Jan Koum and Brian Acton. He had cultivated them since 2010 before closing Sequoia's first investment the following year.Goetz, who holds a master's degree in computer systems from Stanford, co-founded health company VitalSigns, providing the type of first-hand company-building experience that start-up founders prize. In keeping with the firm's more discreet ethos, he holds a low profile compared with partners at other venture firms, or even Sequoia's own star partner, Mike Moritz. He rarely speaks at conferences, refrains from blogging, and has sent out just 180 tweets. But people who have worked with him say he speaks with quiet authority.""He clearly was the most intelligent about our market, and had done better research,"" recalled Jive Software  co-founder Matt Tucker about the days Goetz was courting him and co-founder Tony Zingale.After Sequoia first invested in Jive in 2007, Goetz took Tucker along to a board meeting at fellow portfolio company Palo Alto Networks so he could learn how other companies handled those events. Goetz bought good wine to mark company milestones, invited Tucker and Zingale to parties at his home, and showed an interest in their lives outside work - but stayed focused on the business.""In no way would you confuse Jim as a tender-hearted cuddly bear,"" Tucker said.Staying focused is crucial in the venture-capital industry, which has come under fire for lackluster returns at all but a small group of top firms. As results have disappointed, venture capital firms have raised less money, just $16.7 billion last year compared with $25.93 billion in 2008, according to the National Venture Capital Association.Sequoia is part of an elite group of funds whose results stand out from the venture-capital pack, investors say. It can raise money for each of its venture funds in a matter of days, with so many existing investors clamoring to reinvest that there is little room for new ones.Last year, it raised $1.17 billion for three funds, including $533 million for its flagship Sequoia Capital XIV, according to regulatory filings.Its popularity endures as other parts of the venture business are competing with new sources of funding, such platforms that make it easy for rich individuals to make ""angel"" or early stage investments.

77,"   By Jeremy Wagstaff | Singapore  Singapore WhatsApp may be hugely popular but its forays into Asia, the world's biggest mobile market, have had mixed success, raising questions about whether it can sustain the explosive growth Facebook Inc cited to justify its $19 billion price tag.Data from app metric company App Annie, for example, shows that WhatsApp ranks as the top communications app in only three of 13 Asian countries tracked - Hong Kong, India and Singapore.""WhatsApp has been a strong player in Asia, but in the past year has faced strong competition from LINE and WeChat,"" said Neha Dharia, India-based analyst for Ovum, a technology consultancy. ""WhatsApp has not been displaced by these players, but has seen stiff competition in growing its market share.""Facebook said on Wednesday it would buy WhatsApp for $19 billion in cash and stock, in a deal worth more than Facebook raised in its own IPO. [ID:nL3N0LO52J]For sure, WhatsApp has been phenomenally successful. For many users it has replaced sending costly texts, or SMS messages. Since its launch in 2009 it has built an active monthly user base of 450 million users.A survey by marketing and research company Jana found WhatsApp to be the most used messaging app in all the countries it surveyed - India, Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa, Brazil and Mexico - beating competitors by a huge margin. The reason: users most prize the basic functions it offers - ad-free chat and photo sharing.WhatsApp subscribers sent 18 billion messages a day in January. The overall market is growing rapidly: According to Ovum, 27.4 trillion such messages were sent last year; this year that figure will be close to 69 trillion.CHINA CALLING By hooking up, Facebook and WhatsApp may be able to take on those markets that have been elusive to Facebook so far. With Facebook blocked in China, and lagging Twitter Inc and Naver Corp's LINE in Japan, WhatsApp ""is a potential avenue for Facebook"" into those markets, said Vincent Stevens, a senior manager for telecoms consultancy Delta Partners.Forrester, a consultancy, forecasts that China will have more than 500 million smartphones this year. And in the fast growing smartphone market of India, says Neil Shah, research director of devices and ecosystems at Counterpoint Research, local users now account for almost 9 percent of total active WhatsApp users around the world - some 40 million of them.But Facebook and WhatsApp face formidable foes. Where once messaging apps were simply about messaging, now Tencent Holdings Ltd's WeChat, LINE and KakaoTalk offer a slew of additional services, from icons and games to buying goods and services.""LINE and the others are very different to WhatsApp. They're much more innovative in the business models they engage in,"" says Michael Vakulenko of VisionMobile, a UK-based consultancy. ""They are innovating much faster than WhatsApp and going in a different direction.""This could prove decisive in Asia - the biggest battleground for social messaging apps - where no single player dominates.Data from market research company Nielsen, for example, showed BlackBerry Messenger as the most downloaded messaging app in Indonesia last October, the latest data available, while Viber, bought by Japanese online retailer Rakuten Inc for $900 million last week, was the most popular in the Philippines, and LINE in Thailand. WhatsApp was third in Indonesia, second in Malaysia and not in the top-10 in the Philippines or Thailand. And while locals say WhatsApp remains the default messaging app in Indonesia, some notice a shift.FICKLE FORTUNES Jerry Justianto, who runs a radio station network in Jakarta, says he's noticing fewer of his friends using WhatsApp than before. ""I think it's reached a plateau in Indonesia,"" he said. ""I see a lot of WhatsApp accounts in my list are inactive.""A survey by market research firm On Device Research late last year found that while nearly two thirds of Indonesians surveyed had installed WhatsApp, less than half used it at least once a week, compared to three quarters of Brazilians who had installed it.Part of the problem, Justianto says, is that WhatsApp's approach of linking accounts to a phone number doesn't suit Indonesians who change their SIM card frequently. ""Some of my early adopter friends are moving to Telegram messenger, where you can activate multiple devices with one number."" Telegram, which offers much the same features as WhatsApp, is evidence of the fickleness of users. The app is free and heavily encrypted, and is popular in some countries. In Spain, for example, it has risen from its launch last year to be the No.1 communications app in Google's Play store, at the expense of WhatsApp, according to App Annie data.This, said one executive at a handset company in Spain, was partly because of a viral campaign among users to switch, and partly because many users dumped WhatsApp before they were charged at the end of their first, free year.GETTING USERS TO USE MORE Across Asia, the fragmentation is evident to users such as Martin Tomlinson, Asia Pacific director for On Device Research, who says he has installed at least six messaging apps for work: ""I need to have at least three of these on my phone because that's how my clients communicate.""LINE, for example, considers its top markets as not only Japan but also Taiwan, Thailand and Indonesia. Now, says Simeon Cho, general manager at LINE Plus, which handles LINE's ex-Japan business, the goal is less about winning new users than getting existing ones to use the app more frequently.Kakao, which started the KakaoTalk messenger service in 2010 and has since grown rapidly to 130 million users, said it was also focusing heavily on Southeast Asia, where there is relatively low smartphone penetration and no dominant messenger service.And for China's Tencent, KakaoTalk and LINE are more of a threat overseas than WhatsApp, as the company's WeChat expansion is focused on Southeast Asia.WhatsApp would only pose a serious threat if the likes of Tencent were to expand farther west.

81,"   By Soham Chatterjee and Saqib Iqbal Ahmed  Facebook Inc's purchase of fast-growing messaging startup WhatsApp for an eye-popping $19 billion largely won approval from analysts, who said the deal made strategic sense as it will solidify the social network's position as a leader in mobile.Facebook shares closed up 2.3 percent at $69.63 after falling as much as 3 percent in early trading as investors got over the initial sticker shock of the deal value.At least two brokerages downgraded their recommendations on Facebook to ""hold"" but the overwhelming majority of analysts remain positive on the stock.Facebook is paying more than double its annual revenue for a chat program that has little revenue. The purchase price is slightly more than the market value of Sony Corp.But analysts noted that WhatsApp has over 450 million users and boasts a higher level of engagement than Facebook.""Facebook is the leading global social-sharing utility. Now, it has a significant opportunity to be the leading global communications utility,"" RBC Capital Markets said in a note.WhatsApp is much stronger than Facebook Messenger in Europe, Latin America, Africa and Australia and has attracted users at a time when it appears that young people are turning away from Facebook.Analysts said the price tag for WhatsApp, founded in 2009 by former Yahoo Inc employees Jan Koum and Brian Acton, seemed reasonable from the point of view of value per user. Facebook is paying $42 per user, compared with a market value per user of $170 for Facebook and $212 for Twitter, Deutsche Bank's Ross Sandler said.WhatsApp's user base is less than half that of Facebook's 1.2 billion but the chat program's users are more active. On any given day, 70 percent of WhatsApp users are active, compared with 62 percent for Facebook. WhatsApp's users are expected to reach 1 billion by 2015, according to many analysts.""Looking past the sticker shock of $19 billion ... We view (the deal) as an offensive move to gain additional share of the consumer's time spent,"" Credit Suisse analysts said, noting that Facebook was paying about 11 percent of its market value to gain a 30 percent rise in engagement.HAVE SCALE, WILL MAKE MONEY Of the 44 analysts who cover Facebook, 37 have a ""buy"" or a ""strong buy"" rating on the stock, according to Thomson Reuters data. None has a ""sell"" rating. Analysts have commended Facebook's ability to make money from its mobile app. Now they will want to see how it will earn money from the chat app's huge number of users.""While we don't expect messaging to be a meaningful near-term or even long-term revenue driver, the real value could be the evolution of the platform to incorporate new functionality such as payments, app distribution, social features ...,"" Macquarie Equities Research analyst Ben Schachter said.Facebook has fallen behind in mobile phone messaging apps in emerging markets, where many are accessing the Internet on fast-growing 3G mobile networks for the first time on smartphones.Asian rivals such as Tencent Holdings Ltd's WeChat, Naver Corp's Line and Rakuten Inc's Viber are well ahead of Facebook messenger across much of Asia. Facebook has been buying apps with large numbers of young users as part of Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg's strategy of helping users share any kind of content with anyone.The company's $1 billion deal to buy photo-sharing application Instagram in 2012 and its recent $3 billion failed overture to buy SnapChat - used by teenagers to send texts and photos that disappear after a few seconds - followed unsuccessful attempts to develop rival apps.""Large-scale networks like WhatsApp are rare and provide (a) significant monetization opportunity (i.e. YouTube) justifying valuation over time,"" SunTrust Robinson Humphrey's Robert Peck said in a note.Analysts estimate WhatsApp users share 19 billion messages, 600 million photos, 200 million voice messages, and 100 million video messages per day.Still, some analysts said Facebook was paying a high price to keep WhatsApp from being snapped up by a rival such as Google Inc.""Facebook shares would have been pressured by more than single-digit percentages in after-market trading if Google had purchased WhatsApp instead,"" Stifel analyst Jordan Rohan said in a note.Pivotal Research's Brian Wieser, who downgraded his rating on Facebook shares to ""hold"" from ""buy,"" said he expects Facebook shares to face pressure in the near-term as investors come to terms with the risk of future acquisitions.(Reporting by Soham Chatterjee and Saqib Iqbal Ahmed in Bangalore; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty and Lisa Shumaker)",2014-02-21,FB,"Thu Feb 20, 2014 | 8:25pm EST",Wall Street sees sense in Facebook's $19 billion WhatsApp buy,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-whatsapp-facebook-research-idUSBREA1J14A20140221?type=companyNews
82,"   By Sarah McBride | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Feb 20 Shortly after moving to Silicon Valley in 2004, the young Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg pulled a prank on Sequoia Capital by making an investment pitch in his pajamas.The discussion never got serious, and Sequoia never invested in Facebook. But now, Sequoia is getting the last laugh.With the sale of its protégé company message service WhatsApp to Zuckerberg's Facebook for $19 billion, Sequoia found a way to make money from Facebook as well as solidifying its position as a titan of venture capital. And it establishes partner Jim Goetz, who landed the deal, as one of Silicon Valley's top rainmakers.""This would make a lot more founders want to work with Jim Goetz,"" said Sam Altman, a partner at Y Combinator, a program for start-up companies whose previous startup was backed by Sequoia.In a business where top firms come and go, Sequoia has proved remarkably tenacious. Its big wins take on particular significance in an era when venture firms must beat back challenges from individual investors known as ""angels"" and crowdfunding; new technology that makes early-stage investments less crucial than they once were; and critics who say that venture capital investments aren't worth the trouble.Facebook announced the acquisition deal on Thursday, astounding many with the price it paid for the service, which has 450 million users and is growing at 1 million a day.Sequoia, which invested $60 million and made around $3 billion from WhatsApp, according to a source familiar with the situation, has squeezed a considerable sum out of Facebook , even if it never did invest in the social-media behemoth. Sequoia also backed photo-sharing service Instagram, which Facebook bought in 2012 for $1.01 billion.By contrast, Accel Partners, the biggest venture investor in Facebook, held $7.64 billion worth of Facebook shares at the time of that company's 2012 IPO. Launched in 1972 by Don Valentine, a founder of National Semicondutor, Sequoia was one of the nation's earliest venture-capital firms. As most others of the earlier generation faded from the scene, Sequoia held its own, going on to fund companies including Apple Inc, Oracle Corp, Paypal, and Google Inc.Today, it is involved with many of the hottest startups, including accommodation service Airbnb, file-sharing service Dropbox, invitation service Eventbrite, and stereo and bluetooth headset maker Jawbone.""We were so excited to meet with them,"" said David Rusenko, co-founder of web-hosting service Weebly, recalling his early interactions with Sequoia before the firm invested in his company three years ago. ""Sequoia is the gold standard, as far as we were concerned.""Of course, not everyone holds that view. Silicon Valley impresario Sean Parker, for example, blamed Sequoia for contributing to the downfall of his online-address book company, Plaxo, after he was forced out. Others complain the company is too hard-nosed when it comes to negotiating. And it has missed out on some big success stories, such as Twitter. But among start-ups, the firm holds a reputation for being ahead of the curve on business. For example, Sequoia nudged its portfolio companies to embrace mobile more forcefully and earlier than other venture firms, Rusenko said.He and other founders say that the firm, based on Silicon Valley's legendary Sand Hill Road, is adept at competing with other venture capitalists when a start-up is seeking funds. It also excels at courting companies that aren't actively seeking funding and persuading them to take it - like WhatsApp.""The notion of them marching up and down Sand Hill with a Powerpoint deck is comical,"" Goetz told Reuters, referring to WhatsApp founders Jan Koum and Brian Acton. He had cultivated them since 2010 before closing Sequoia's first investment the following year.Goetz, who holds a master's degree in computer systems from Stanford, co-founded health company VitalSigns, providing the type of first-hand company-building experience that start-up founders prize. In keeping with the firm's more discreet ethos, he holds a low profile compared with partners at other venture firms, or even Sequoia's own star partner, Mike Moritz. He rarely speaks at conferences, refrains from blogging, and has sent out just 180 tweets. But people who have worked with him say he speaks with quiet authority.""He clearly was the most intelligent about our market, and had done better research,"" recalled Jive Software  co-founder Matt Tucker about the days Goetz was courting him and co-founder Tony Zingale.After Sequoia first invested in Jive in 2007, Goetz took Tucker along to a board meeting at fellow portfolio company Palo Alto Networks so he could learn how other companies handled those events. Goetz bought good wine to mark company milestones, invited Tucker and Zingale to parties at his home, and showed an interest in their lives outside work - but stayed focused on the business.""In no way would you confuse Jim as a tender-hearted cuddly bear,"" Tucker said.Staying focused is crucial in the venture-capital industry, which has come under fire for lackluster returns at all but a small group of top firms. As results have disappointed, venture capital firms have raised less money, just $16.7 billion last year compared with $25.93 billion in 2008, according to the National Venture Capital Association.Sequoia is part of an elite group of funds whose results stand out from the venture-capital pack, investors say. It can raise money for each of its venture funds in a matter of days, with so many existing investors clamoring to reinvest that there is little room for new ones.Last year, it raised $1.17 billion for three funds, including $533 million for its flagship Sequoia Capital XIV, according to regulatory filings.Its popularity endures as other parts of the venture business are competing with new sources of funding, such platforms that make it easy for rich individuals to make ""angel"" or early stage investments. Meanwhile, because the cost of so much technology, such as servers, has dropped drastically in recent years, many start-up founders can build their companies to sizeable levels without the need to turn to venture backers.",2014-02-21,FB,"Thu Feb 20, 2014 | 8:07pm EST","With WhatsApp deal, Sequoia Capital burnishes reputation",http://www.reuters.com//article/whatsapp-facebook-sequoia-idUSL2N0LP2U520140221?type=companyNews

86,"   By Leila Abboud and Eric Auchard | BARCELONA  BARCELONA WhatsApp will add free voice-call services for its 450 million customers later this year, laying down a new challenge to telecom network operators just days after Facebook Inc scooped it up for $19 billion.The text-based messaging service aims to let users make calls by the second quarter, expanding its appeal to help it hit a billion users, WhatsApp CEO Jan Koum said at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona on Monday.Buying WhatsApp has cemented Facebook's involvement in messaging, which for many people is their earliest experience with the mobile Internet. Adding voice services moves the social network into another core function on a smartphone.On Monday, Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg defended the price paid for a messaging service with negligible revenue. He argued that rival services such as South Korea's KakaoTalk and Naver's LINE are already ""monetizing"" at a rate of $2 to $3 in revenue per user per year, despite being in the early stages of growth.Media reports put WhatsApp's revenue at about $20 million in 2013.""I actually think that by itself it's worth more than 19 billion,"" Zuckerberg told the Mobile World Congress. ""Even just independently, I think it's a good bet.""""By being a part of Facebook, it makes it so they can focus for the next five years or so purely on adding more people."" WhatsApp's move into voice calls is unlikely to sit well with telecoms carriers.WhatsApp and its rivals, like KakaoTalk, China's WeChat, and Viber, have won over telecom operators' customers in recent years by offering a free option to text messaging. Telecom providers globally generated revenue of about $120 billion from text messaging last year, according to market researcher Ovum.Adding free calls threatens another telecom revenue source, which has been declining anyway as carriers' tweak tariffs to focus on mobile data instead of calls. WITH, NOT AGAINST Since the advent a decade ago of Skype's voice over Internet service, which Microsoft Corp has acquired, and the rise of Internet service providers like Google Inc, telecom bosses have gotten used to facing challengers whose services piggyback on their networks. But carriers complain that the rivals are not subject to the same national regulations.Mats Granryd, the CEO of Swedish mobile operator Tele2, said he was happy to partner with the likes of WhatsApp because of the additional data traffic they generate. But he shared the concerns of other network operators that they must operate under strict national regulations that Internet companies are not subject to.""They (Internet firms) need to be regulated a little bit more and we need to be regulated a little bit less,"" said Jo Lunder, who heads Russian mobile network operator VimpelCom. Vodafone CEO Vittorio Colao said he did not understand how such an important acquisition as the Facebook-WhatsApp deal could go unchallenged at a time when European network operators were facing intense regulatory scrutiny.""These types of deal are a clear indication that the world is changing and the regulations don't fit anymore,"" Colao said on the sidelines of the conference.Both Facebook and WhatsApp CEOs have cast themselves as partners to telecoms network operators.On Monday, Koum also announced a partnership with E-Plus, the German subsidiary of Dutch group KPN, under which it will launch a WhatsApp-branded mobile service in Germany.The European Parliament is set to vote on Monday night on a package of proposed telecoms market reforms which among other provisions would restrict the ability of carriers to charge internet companies like Facebook to give them an enhanced service in handling their network traffic.(Additional reporting by Kate Holton; Editing by Greg Mahlich)",2014-02-24,FB,"Mon Feb 24, 2014 | 5:12pm EST",WhatsApp to add voice calls after Facebook acquisition,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-mobile-world-whatsapp-idUSBREA1N0PT20140224?type=companyNews
87,"   By Denny Thomas and Paul Carsten | HONG KONG/BEIJING  HONG KONG/BEIJING Billionaire Jack Ma's Alibaba, the dominant force in China's $1.6 trillion e-commerce market, may already have lost a battle with rival Tencent for the world's biggest mobile market.While Alibaba Group Holding Ltd dominates in e-commerce, Tencent Holdings Ltd has taken over China's smartphone screens with its WeChat, or Weixin, social messaging platform.It's a battle that is being more closely watched after Facebook Inc's $19 billion WhatsApp buy, and puts the spotlight on Ma's mobile strategy, especially as Alibaba winds up for a mega IPO that could value the company at close to $130 billion.The WhatsApp acquisition and that of mobile messaging firm Viber by Japan's Rakuten Inc have driven home this month how crucial mobile messaging platforms are to controlling user experience on smartphone screens.""The world's major tech companies are realizing that having a really popular mobile messenger has simply become table stake for competing in this era of computing,"" said Ted Livingston, CEO of Kik Messenger, a WhatsApp rival. ""If you want to play in mobile, you need to have a popular mobile messenger. You don't have one? You don't get to play.""Alibaba has been grappling with its mobile business in China, and its Laiwang mobile messaging app has yet to make a big impact - either as a chat app or a portal for mobile gaming. As of November, Laiwang had 10 million users, according to Alibaba. As of September, Tencent's WeChat mobile messaging app had 272 million monthly active users, booking taxis, topping up phone credit and even investing in wealth management products.Some observers say that's too big a catch-up for Alibaba.""WeChat has won China,"" said Ben Thompson, who writes about technology at stratechery.com in Taipei. ""It's going to be the dominant application there. Tencent controls the channel, the customer relationship (and) that means they can promote their services and e-commerce offerings to the exclusion and detriment of Alibaba.""Data from Chinese app store Wandoujia show that games released on WeChat rocketed to the top of their most-downloaded lists, suggesting the app's appeal goes well beyond messaging.Forrester, a consultancy, forecasts that China will have more than 500 million smartphones this year. GAME ON Ma doesn't look like he's thrown in the towel, and was widely reported as telling employees they wouldn't receive their annual bonus unless they signed up 100 new users for Laiwang. He also offered cash rewards to those who signed up the most users.Last month, Alibaba announced plans to set up a mobile gaming platform - after repeatedly saying it would not go into gaming - venturing into a fast growing sector dominated by Tencent in China. At the time, Alibaba spokesman Wang Shuai said that games developed for Laiwang would be specifically designed to compete with WeChat titles. ""We're unhappy with Tencent's monopoly in this industry,"" he wrote on Alibaba's microblog. ""We have to help to fight for a healthy environment for game development.""""They're very aware their mobile apps are doing well from an e-commerce standpoint,"" said a Hong Kong-based M&A banker who is aware of Alibaba's strategy. ""But the way people use mobile is changing and if they don't adapt, they run the risk that WeChat is going to take some of their market share.""Alibaba has tried to push its mobile offerings to clients and users, setting up a 500 million yuan ($82 million) investment fund to give away smartphones to online merchants using Alibaba's sites. Last year, Alibaba offered up to 2 gigabytes of free mobile data to users in certain Chinese provinces if they applied for the data through Alibaba apps. When Tencent launched a ""red envelope"" feature for WeChat for Chinese New Year, letting users send traditional money gifts by smartphone, Ma called it a ""Pearl Harbour attack"" on his personal Laiwang account. Tencent said more than 8 million people used the WeChat feature.LINING UP TARGETS? Alibaba controls about 80 percent of China's e-commerce and, while there is little immediate threat that WeChat or others are making a huge dent, Tencent is gaining momentum in smartphone-based e-commerce.""In theory, if Alibaba did nothing WeChat could completely take over mobile commerce - that's not really acceptable,"" said Marc Einstein, a Tokyo-based tech analyst at Frost & Sullivan.Alibaba is mindful of the competition, bankers said, but unlike Facebook, it's constrained by what it can buy and how it can structure deals - it already has Yahoo Inc and SoftBank Corp as big strategic shareholders. Analysts and bankers point to two potential acquisition targets for Alibaba. Naver Corp's LINE, a Japanese messenger with 350 million users that is said to be preparing for an initial public offering, and South Korea's KakaoTalk, which would seem a distant and unlikely second choice as Tencent owns a 13.84 percent stake in its owner, Kakao.""If you can't build it, buy it,"" said Frank Yu, a Beijing-based technology investment adviser and CEO of Kwestr, an online social game. ""They're going to be on a buying spree, if not already in discussions.""But Facebook's stratospheric valuation of WhatsApp - a basic messaging app rather than a broad social platform with games, finance and e-commerce - has upped the ante and is likely to make any acquisition even more costly.""The question is whether (WeChat) will drive Alibaba into doing a crazy Facebook-like deal,"" said a second person familiar with Alibaba's thinking. ""The options available to Alibaba are limited if they decide to turn aggressive on acquisitions. They can either buy LINE or bid for KakaoTalk. Those would be desperate moves.""As Tencent makes inroads into Alibaba's e-commerce turf - it this month bought 20 percent of Dianping, China's largest restaurant review and business listing site, and is reported to be in talks with online retailer JD.com to combine their e-commerce businesses - an alternative strategy for Ma may be to swallow defeat and work with Tencent, pushing Alibaba's services through WeChat.""It's a difficult and emasculating situation,"" said stratechery.com's Thompson. ""The users are on WeChat. The best Alibaba can do is accept that reality and see what it can do to co-opt it.""Alibaba and Tencent declined to comment.($1 = 6.0914 Chinese yuan)(Additional reporting by Gerry Shih in SAN FRANCISCO; Editing by Ian Geoghegan)",2014-02-24,FB,"Mon Feb 24, 2014 | 4:06pm EST",What's up for Alibaba's mobile app strategy?,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-mobile-alibaba-idUSBREA1N1S020140224?type=companyNews

89,"   By Denny Thomas and Paul Carsten | HONG KONG/BEIJING  HONG KONG/BEIJING Feb 25 Billionaire Jack Ma's Alibaba, the dominant force in China's $1.6 trillion e-commerce market, may already have lost a battle with rival Tencent for the world's biggest mobile market.While Alibaba Group Holding Ltd dominates in e-commerce, Tencent Holdings Ltd has taken over China's smartphone screens with its WeChat, or Weixin, social messaging platform.It's a battle that is being more closely watched after Facebook Inc's $19 billion WhatsApp buy,  and puts the spotlight on Ma's mobile strategy, especially as Alibaba winds up for a mega IPO that could value the company at close to $130 billion.The WhatsApp acquisition and that of mobile messaging firm Viber by Japan's Rakuten Inc have driven home this month how crucial mobile messaging platforms are to controlling user experience on smartphone screens.""The world's major tech companies are realizing that having a really popular mobile messenger has simply become table stake for competing in this era of computing,"" said Ted Livingston, CEO of Kik Messenger, a WhatsApp rival. ""If you want to play in mobile, you need to have a popular mobile messenger. You don't have one? You don't get to play.""Alibaba has been grappling with its mobile business in China, and its Laiwang mobile messaging app has yet to make a big impact - either as a chat app or a portal for mobile gaming. As of November, Laiwang had 10 million users, according to Alibaba. As of September, Tencent's WeChat mobile messaging app had 272 million monthly active users, booking taxis, topping up phone credit and even investing in wealth management products.Some observers say that's too big a catch-up for Alibaba.""WeChat has won China,"" said Ben Thompson, who writes about technology at stratechery.com in Taipei. ""It's going to be the dominant application there. Tencent controls the channel, the customer relationship (and) that means they can promote their services and e-commerce offerings to the exclusion and detriment of Alibaba.""Data from Chinese app store Wandoujia show that games released on WeChat rocketed to the top of their most-downloaded lists, suggesting the app's appeal goes well beyond messaging.Forrester, a consultancy, forecasts that China will have more than 500 million smartphones this year. GAME ON Ma doesn't look like he's thrown in the towel, and was widely reported as telling employees they wouldn't receive their annual bonus unless they signed up 100 new users for Laiwang. He also offered cash rewards to those who signed up the most users.Last month, Alibaba announced plans to set up a mobile gaming platform - after repeatedly saying it would not go into gaming - venturing into a fast growing sector dominated by Tencent in China. At the time, Alibaba spokesman Wang Shuai said that games developed for Laiwang would be specifically designed to compete with WeChat titles. ""We're unhappy with Tencent's monopoly in this industry,"" he wrote on Alibaba's microblog. ""We have to help to fight for a healthy environment for game development."" ""They're very aware their mobile apps are doing well from an e-commerce standpoint,"" said a Hong Kong-based M&A banker who is aware of Alibaba's strategy. ""But the way people use mobile is changing and if they don't adapt, they run the risk that WeChat is going to take some of their market share.""Alibaba has tried to push its mobile offerings to clients and users, setting up a 500 million yuan ($82 million) investment fund to give away smartphones to online merchants using Alibaba's sites. Last year, Alibaba offered up to 2 gigabytes of free mobile data to users in certain Chinese provinces if they applied for the data through Alibaba apps.When Tencent launched a ""red envelope"" feature for WeChat for Chinese New Year, letting users send traditional money gifts by smartphone, Ma called it a ""Pearl Harbour attack"" on his personal Laiwang account. Tencent said more than 8 million people used the WeChat feature.LINING UP TARGETS? Alibaba controls about 80 percent of China's e-commerce and, while there is little immediate threat that WeChat or others are making a huge dent, Tencent is gaining momentum in smartphone-based e-commerce. ""In theory, if Alibaba did nothing WeChat could completely take over mobile commerce - that's not really acceptable,"" said Marc Einstein, a Tokyo-based tech analyst at Frost & Sullivan.Alibaba is mindful of the competition, bankers said, but unlike Facebook, it's constrained by what it can buy and how it can structure deals - it already has Yahoo Inc and SoftBank Corp as big strategic shareholders.Analysts and bankers point to two potential acquisition targets for Alibaba. Naver Corp's LINE, a Japanese messenger with 350 million users that is said to be preparing for an initial public offering, and South Korea's KakaoTalk, which would seem a distant and unlikely second choice as Tencent owns a 13.84 percent stake in its owner, Kakao.""If you can't build it, buy it,"" said Frank Yu, a Beijing-based technology investment adviser and CEO of Kwestr, an online social game. ""They're going to be on a buying spree, if not already in discussions.""But Facebook's stratospheric valuation of WhatsApp - a basic messaging app rather than a broad social platform with games, finance and e-commerce - has upped the ante and is likely to make any acquisition even more costly.""The question is whether (WeChat) will drive Alibaba into doing a crazy Facebook-like deal,"" said a second person familiar with Alibaba's thinking. ""The options available to Alibaba are limited if they decide to turn aggressive on acquisitions. They can either buy LINE or bid for KakaoTalk. Those would be desperate moves.""As Tencent makes inroads into Alibaba's e-commerce turf - it this month bought 20 percent of Dianping, China's largest restaurant review and business listing site, and is reported to be in talks with online retailer JD.com to combine their e-commerce businesses - an alternative strategy for Ma may be to swallow defeat and work with Tencent, pushing Alibaba's services through WeChat.""It's a difficult and emasculating situation,"" said stratechery.com's Thompson. ""The users are on WeChat. The best Alibaba can do is accept that reality and see what it can do to co-opt it.""Alibaba and Tencent declined to comment.",2014-02-24,FB,"Mon Feb 24, 2014 | 4:00pm EST",What's up for Alibaba's mobile app strategy?,http://www.reuters.com//article/tech-mobile-alibaba-idUSL3N0LQ2NJ20140224?type=companyNews
90,"   By Alexei Oreskovic and Leila Abboud | SAN FRANCISCO/BARCELONA  SAN FRANCISCO/BARCELONA Facebook Inc Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg took a victory lap at the world's largest mobile technology conference in Barcelona on Monday, after beating out Google Inc in a $19 billion acquisition of free messaging service WhatsApp. But he faces bigger hurdles on the horizon.Just 18 months after appearing at risk of getting crushed by the swelling mobile wave, the No. 1 social network is riding high. It gets a huge chunk of ad revenue on world-wide users of smartphones and tablets, from virtually nothing several years ago.Now, Zuckerberg's purchase of WhatsApp - while raising eyebrows with the hefty price paid for a company that boasts 450 million users but has little revenue - places Facebook at the heart of smartphone communications.""In the U.S. you can dial 911 and get access to basic services,"" Zuckerberg said, referring to the country's national emergency services phone number.""We want to create a similar kind of dial tone for the Internet,"" he said, citing messaging, search and weather information among the essential online services that he said people throughout the world should be able to access on Internet-connected phones.It's a vision that is sure to have some telecom bosses in Barcelona gritting their teeth. WhatsApp and its fellow messaging apps, including Viber and China's WeChat, have punched a hole in operators' sales by offering a free alternative to text messages, a $120 billion market for operators. Research group Ovum said telcos lost $32 billion in text revenue last year and will lose $54 billion by 2016.But Zuckerberg is trying to cast Facebook and WhatsApp as partners not foes of the industry.The 29-year-old co-founder of Facebook used his appearance at Mobile World Congress on Monday to talk up his company's recent effort to make wireless Internet access easier and more affordable in developing countries.With WhatsApp now part of Facebook, Zuckerberg said the messaging service will have the breathing room to put its energy into garnering another 2 billion or 3 billion users, rather than trying to generate revenue.SURPRISE DEAL  Facebook's purchase of WhatsApp is its latest move to transform a platform and company born on the PC into a full-fledged network for a mobile generation. Zuckerberg's progress so far on mobile has positioned the company to take advantage of the fast-growing markets. And it has helped boost Facebook's stock roughly 150 percent since July.But with a new crop of smartphone applications threatening to eat into Facebook's audience, worrying signs of waning interest amongst younger users - which the WhatsApp acquisition may help address - and a tech landscape evolving more rapidly than ever before, Facebook can't afford to fall behind again.That is critical for Facebook as it courts the ""next 5 billion"" Internet users, many of whom live in places like India and Africa and who are likely to first experience the Internet on a mobile rather than a PC.""If Facebook is not first in line when those people are firing up their devices, it stands a chance of never connecting with those folks, because there are so many alternatives,"" said Brian Blau, an analyst at research firm Gartner.Zuckerberg said the plan to bring wireless Internet access, and Facebook, to the world is a long-term project that won't pay off anytime soon. ""I think we're probably going to lose money on this for quite a while,"" Zuckerberg said.NO SURE THING To some, Google wields the advantage for now.Its Android mobile operating system comes pre-installed on roughly 80 percent of the smartphones sold in the world today. That helps ensure new users will see and use its various online services, including search, maps and its Google+ social network.Once WhatsApp is in Facebook's pocket, there's no guarantee the messaging service - which famously eschews games, shopping or other popular add-ons to focus on pure messaging - can remain ahead in a notoriously fickle market. Rival messaging apps such as Tencent Holding's WeChat and Naver's LINE are popular across Asia and have hundreds of millions of users. They have also expanded to allow users to book taxis, top up phone credit, and take part in flash sales, all on the app.WhatsApp, which Zuckerberg has promised will remain independent, fits Facebook's recent approach of designing or buying ""spinoff"" apps for smartphones, such as Instagram or the Paper news app, which has earned positive reviews.""You see Facebook trying to increase its surface area, with different apps for different things,"" said Josh Elman, a venture capital firm Greylock Partners. The idea is to give users multiple ways to interact with Facebook throughout the day.To meet his ambitions, Zuckerberg could use the telecom industry's help. He will make his case to the handset makers and operators gathered in Barcelona that they should work together to make Internet access cheaper and more ubiquitous in the developing world.Facebook has partnered with over 150 wireless providers over the past four years to offer free or discounted access to the social network, including a deal with Globe Telecom to provide three months of free access to customers in the Philippines.Once people experience the benefits of wireless Internet access they will upgrade to additional data services, generating more profit for wireless carriers, Zuckerberg said.The idea, he said, is to build a ""more profitable model, with more subscribers for carriers, and get everyone on the Internet in a hopefully shorter period of time.""Not everyone is on board.Vodafone Chief Executive Vittorio Colao said earlier this month that Facebook had approached him about waiving data charges when customers access the website from their mobiles.

95,"  * Line has held talks with SoftBank founder Son -Bloomberg* Line's parent Naver says no plan, no reason to sell* SoftBank tie-up would increase appetite for IPO -analysts* SoftBank would help Line make inroads in U.S. -analysts   (Recasts and adds comments from analysts)By Sophie Knight and Miyoung KimTOKYO/SEOUL, Feb 25 Japan-based Line Corp denied a media report it was in talks to sell a stake to SoftBank Corp  - a report that comes after big acquisitions of rival messaging app firms have fanned speculation that it too may be up for grabs.SoftBank's founder Masayoshi Son has held talks with Line about a purchase, Bloomberg News said, citing a person with knowledge of the matter. It added that Line had also received at least one other offer for all or some of the company, prompting it to slow preparations for an IPO.Both Line and its South Korean parent company Naver Corp  denied the report.""The report is groundless. We haven't had any talks with SoftBank,"" said an official in Naver's investor relations team.""There's no reason to sell a stake and no plan to sell."" SoftBank, Japan's No. 3 biggest mobile operator and a prolific investor in Internet firms, said it would not comment on speculation.Line, one of Asia's most aggressive chat services, has been valued by analysts at roughly $14 billion but those estimates were made before Facebook Inc's shocking $19 billion purchase of WhatsApp last week that threw conventional methods of valuing messaging apps out the window.The Facebook/WhatsApp deal sparked fears that Line would now find it difficult to break into key markets like the United States, causing Naver's shares to slump but they recovered some ground on the Bloomberg report, shooting as much as 9 percent higher.Lee Chang-young, an analyst at Tong Yang Securities, said that any alliance with telecoms operators would make sense, also noting that a $900 million deal by Japanese online shopping mall Rakuten Inc for chat app Viber this month has raised the stakes in its home market.""A deal with SoftBank, in particular, will help them generate synergies by combining mobile services with a messenger platform. It'll also help Line expand in the U.S. market where SoftBank is expanding aggressively,"" he said. IPO APPEAL Banking sources have said Line is preparing for an initial public offering some time this year either in Tokyo or overseas. Backing from a high-profile investor like SoftBank could increase appetite for a listing.SoftBank, Japan's second-biggest firm by market capitalisation, has been highly acquisitive, paying $21.6 billion for 80 percent for U.S. mobile operator Sprint and keen to buy T-Mobile - a deal that has been estimated at $20 billion although it faces significant regulatory hurdles. David Gibson, senior research analyst for games at Macquarie Securities in Tokyo, surmised that if SoftBank was interested in Line, it was most likely interested in a smaller stake.""I would have said SoftBank would say we'll buy 10 percent and you still IPO,"" he said.Line, which also has a strong presence in Thailand, Taiwan and Indonesia, had been downloaded a total of 360 million times as of Feb. 20, the company said.Macquarie estimates around half of the downloads are active monthly users, a figure the company does not release. WhatsApp said on Monday it had 465 million monthly active users, meaning Facebook paid around $40 per user.Line has made more progress than WhatsApp and many other rival chat services in monetisation through games and the sale of oversized emoticons known as stickers.""The IPO is about showing increased monetisation in Japan, and two, increased monetisation of the 75 percent of users outside Japan,"" said Gibson.Line's revenue last year reached 34.3 billion yen ($335 million), making it the top-grossing non-game app in 2013 in both Apple Inc's iOS store and Google Inc's  Google Play store, according to marketing research firm App Annie.A report from Citi estimates that Line's active users are worth 109,543 won ($100) due to its success in monetisation.($1 = 102.4500 Japanese yen)   (Additional reporting by Hyunjoo Jin and in Seoul, Chang-Ran Kim, Reiji Murai and Yoshiyasu Shida in Tokyo; Editing by Edmund Klamann and Edwina Gibbs)",2014-02-25,FB,"Tue Feb 25, 2014 | 2:12am EST",UPDATE 2-Japan's Line denies report of talks to sell stake to SoftBank,http://www.reuters.com//article/naver-softbank-idUSL3N0LU0NG20140225?type=companyNews
96,"   By Jennifer Saba  Facebook highlighted on Wednesday two ad campaigns in an attempt to persuade advertisers that its massive membership base and ability to home in on specific audiences makes it a more effective advertising platform than broadcast TV.The No. 1 social network revealed in a blog post some details about marketing campaigns from AARP and the American Legacy Foundation to show how Facebook can target specific age groups among its audience of more than 1 billion global users, which rivals the number of people watching TV.Facebook is hoping to tap some of the billions of dollars that advertisers dedicate to television commercials to reach large groups of people.""For an advertiser, in Facebook's view their users are more engaged than when they are watching TV,"" said Debra Aho Williamson, principal analyst at research firm eMarketer. ""It's not just sitting on the couch and watching something go by.""Still TV gets the lion's share of ad dollars with more than $66 billion in 2013 in the U.S. alone, according to eMarketer. Facebook generated roughly $7 billion  in global ad revenue during the same year. The AARP, an association for older Americans, sought to target ads to Facebook members over 45 in order to build awareness that the organization is for more than just retired people, Facebook said in its blog post, while the American Legacy Foundation wanted to reach teenagers for its Truth campaign to curb smoking.Both campaigns ran in Facebook's News Feed interspersed among a user's stream of news and other updates.""One of the things we wanted to test is if there a better result when you air a TV ad spot and support it on social media,"" said Tammy Gordon, AARP vice president of social strategy.

100,"  Feb 28 (The following statement was released by the rating agency)Facebook's acquisition of WhatsApp, and the  messaging service's plans to expand to include voice calls, will put further  pressure on telcos' ability to increase free cash flows, Fitch Ratings says.'Over-the-top' (OTT) operators, which also include Skype, Twitter and Google , provide a cheaper substitute for telcos' traditional voice and text messaging  services. But the resulting surge in data use is not translating into  proportionally higher telco EBITDA, because data services are lower margin than  the traditional services they replace. Thus, while investment in data networks  is still economically justified, weakening cash flows from traditional services  means that telcos have to spend more capital simply to maintain EBITDA at the  same level. As smartphones proliferate, OTT operators ride the telcos' infrastructure for  free and generally have a stronger brand connection with their customers than  telcos. Almost all telcos are facing declining margins due to these trends as  few have a strong enough market position to price data high enough to maintain  margins. However, the  impact can vary significantly.Telcos that have anticipated the changing market by moving to integrated  tariffs, where calls, texts and data are all included for a single price, face  less pressure. This is because it's mainly their out-of-bundle revenues, such as  metered calls and texts, which are at risk. In the Netherlands, for example, KPN  saw a 13% fall in consumer mobile service revenue in 4Q11, and warned of a poor  2012 outlook, while Vodafone's Dutch business saw a much smaller impact because  of its earlier introduction of integrated tariffs. Similarly in Asia the threat of OTT operators is more pronounced in some  markets. Philippines telcos are exposed as they derive a significantly high  portion (30%) of their revenue from text. Typically, OTT operators tend to  substitute text first and then voice as the quality of data improves within a  market. However, markets including India, Indonesia and Sri Lanka are currently  less exposed as voice and text pricing is relatively low and smartphones have  yet to reach significant penetration. Singaporean telcos including SingTel have also tried to limit the impact by  introducing pay-as-you-go data tariffs and are building their own OTT brands,  such as Amobee - for mobile advertising - and Hungry-go-where - a Singaporean  based restaurant reviewer. However, these steps are small and unlikely to turn  back the tide.Not investing in data networks is not an option for telcos, which face  continuing capex to increase network capacity as data use rises. All will face  the challenge of retaining a share of the telecommunications value chain to  avoid becoming a 'dumb pipe' for OTT operators with stronger brands. Use of OTT  services will also make coverage levels an increasingly important  differentiator, as consumers will not put up with patchy data coverage. This can  already be seen in the US market, where Verizon Wireless has had some success  with its marketing campaign highlighting its better coverage than AT&T.Fitch's telco ratings reflect our conservative expectations of lower margins and  additional investment required as data substitutes for voice and text. The  trends highlighted here indicate that the rating risks are almost all on the  downside.",2014-02-28,FB,"Fri Feb 28, 2014 | 5:14am EST","RPT-Fitch: Facebook, Skype Challenge Telcos' Free Cash Flows",http://www.reuters.com//article/fitch-facebook-skype-challenge-telcos-fr-idUSFit69173920140228?type=companyNews

In eliminating the Facebook and Google sign-in features, Mayer, a former Google executive, is effectively reversing a strategy that Yahoo adopted in 2010 and 2011 under then CEO Carol Bartz.The change to the Tourney Pick'Em sign-in process began on Monday, the Yahoo spokeswoman said, noting that users could still access other services with Google or Facebook IDs.The sign-in buttons for Facebook and Google will eventually be removed from all Yahoo properties, the Yahoo spokeswoman, though she declined to provide a timeframe.",2014-03-05,FB,"Tue Mar 4, 2014 | 9:12pm EST","Yahoo to stop user access of services with Facebook, Google IDs",http://www.reuters.com//article/yahoo-login-idUSL1N0M20FO20140305?type=companyNews
111,"   By Alexei Oreskovic | SAN FRANCISCO, March 6  SAN FRANCISCO, March 6 Privacy advocates have asked U.S. regulators to halt Facebook Inc's $19 billion acquisition of messaging service WhatsApp until there is a clearer understanding of how the company intends to use the personal data of WhatsApp's 450 million users.WhatsApp, a service that allows mobile phone users to send each other messages, has had a longstanding commitment to not collect user data for advertising purposes.But there's no guarantee that that commitment will hold true once the service becomes part of Facebook, according to the filing to the Federal Trade Commission by the Electronic Privacy Information Center and the Center for Digital Democracy, both non-profit groups.The complaint asks regulators to investigate the deal ""specifically with regard to the ability of Facebook to access WhatsApp's store of user mobile phone numbers and metadata."" Facebook, the world's No.1 social network with 1.2 billion users, generates the majority of its revenue by showing ads that target users by age, gender and other traits.""As we have said repeatedly, Whatsapp will operate as a separate company and will honor its commitments to privacy and security,"" Facebook said in a statement in response to the filing. The FTC declined to comment. Facebook stunned the technology industry last month when it announced its intention to buy the five-year old WhatsApp for $19 billion in cash and stock. WhatsApp does not show ads on its service, charging some of its users a $1 annual fee to use the service.WhatsApp stores users' mobile phone numbers, but unlike many online services, it does not collect user names, emails, and other contact information. Despite assurances by WhatsApp and Facebook that the privacy policies will not change, the groups that wrote the FTC filing note that Facebook has in the past amended an acquired-company's privacy policies, such as the Instagram photo-sharing service that Facebook acquired in 2012.Regulators must require that Facebook ""insulate"" WhatsApp user information from access by Facebook's data collection practices, reads the complaint.""WhatsApp users could not reasonably have anticipated that by selecting a pro-privacy messaging service, they would subject their data to Facebook's data collection practices,"" reads the filing.",2014-03-06,FB,"Thu Mar 6, 2014 | 3:45pm EST",Privacy groups ask regulators to halt Facebook's $19 bln WhatsApp deal,http://www.reuters.com//article/facebook-whatsapp-idUSL1N0M328A20140306?type=companyNews

113,"  By Joseph MennSAN FRANCISCO, March 7 A few days after selling WhatsApp to Facebook for $19 billion, Jan Koum stepped into a suite at the St. Regis Hotel in San Francisco to celebrate with old friends, including CEOs, reformed hackers and a few people who fell into both those camps.Conducted over snacks and beer, the late-night festivity was a spontaneous reunion of a security super-group that had come to Koum's aid in 2000 as he grappled with a denial-of-service attack that knocked Yahoo offline when Koum was responsible for security there.The now defunct collective known as w00w00 (pronounced whoo whoo) had thrived on Internet Relay Chat channels in the late 1990s and early 2000s, between get-togethers at hacking conventions such as Def Con in Las Vegas, where a member said Koum ""came across like a big, friendly kid.""Although the elite group was not well known outside hacking circles, its members have spawned more than a dozen companies, mainly in security. The two most famous exceptions are WhatsApp, the messaging service that Koum co-founded, and Napster, the pioneering file-sharing company that was shut down by the music industry in 2001.The key to w00w00's success, according to interviews with a dozen members, was that it brought together people with widely varying expertise and backgrounds in a meritocratic way that would be tough to replicate in today's more complex and competitive world of security.Koum was already a senior Yahoo Inc executive in his early 20s when he joined w00w00. Napster Co-founder Shawn Fanning was one of several members still in high school. Both came from poor backgrounds and benefited from the group's welcoming culture, which prized collaboration in the era before computer security became a big business, let alone a major factor in national defense and offense.""Communication was democratized, and curiosity was rewarded,"" Koum told Reuters last week. ""I had so much fun in early days learning about networking, security, scalability and other geeky stuff.""The w00w00 party at the St. Regis on Feb. 26 came during the peak of the week-long RSA Conference across the street, the largest gathering of tech security professionals in the world. Some w00w00 veterans were attending the show to hawk software or services from their companies, while others were taking pains to avoid the marketing hype powered by a flood of new investment.At the reunion, most of the crew ignored the cheese and dried fruit to catch up on old times and toast the man they regard as the first real w00w00 billionaire. The Ukraine-born Koum, who wore a gray T-shirt and black sweatshirt over his large frame, made $6.8 billion from the sale of WhatsApp to Facebook Inc, according to Forbes.(Napster co-founder Sean Parker is also a billionaire, having gotten rich through owning early stock in Facebook, but he was too business-minded to spend much time in w00ww00.)The gathering was also an occasion to reflect on why the security issues that the w00w00ers worked on 15 years ago were such excellent preparation for broader technology innovation, and why that might be less true now.""You don't get cats and mice playing well together anymore, because the stakes have gotten so high and the net has become politicized,"" said Dug Song, who was a core w00w00 member. ""W00w00 was the Switzerland of computer security."" TAKEN FOR GRANTED In the 1990s, deep tech knowledge was needed to make things work. Now that infrastructure has been built out and cloud-computing resources can be rented cheaply from the likes of Amazon.com Inc, much more is taken for granted.""Young kids have less interest in security these days,"" said Ejovi Nuwere, an orphan from Brooklyn who joined w00w00 before he signed on as a security engineer at Lehman Brothers and then went on to found multiple companies. ""There's a lot more interest in starting the next Facebook than in reverse-engineering software.""Founded by Utah teenager Matt Conover, who chose the silly, exclamation-like name, w00w00 claimed about 30 core contributors at its peak, each of them invited by an existing member.Several participants had wandered to the wrong side of the law in the past. At 15, Nuwere hacked into his local Internet service provider. When he called the company and explained how he did it, he was hired at minimum wage.Another w00w00er, Anthony Zboralski, received a suspended sentence in 1997 for posing as a Paris FBI official and using the agency's network services - provided by AT&T - for free for four months.The sentence was later expunged, and Zboralski went on to handle major security projects for the Indonesian government and others. Nuwere said the group adopted a ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy, though anyone who was obviously hacking for malicious reasons was shunned.Most members of w00w00 were conducting research on their own, at small companies or ensconced in big ones like Koum.""We had some really rich and interesting discussions about security topics,"" Conover recalled. ""If someone had a good tool they wrote, they'd likely share it.""One of those tools was the Nmap Security Scanner, created by w00w00 member Gordon Lyon. Used by defenders and attackers alike, the program scans networks for open ports, available services and deployed software. Another tool was the member-developed password cracker, John the Ripper.W00w00 members regularly spoke at the top security conventions. One of them, Jeff Forristal, under the handle ""Rain Forest Puppy,"" published guidelines for responsibly disclosing flaws to software vendors before the general public.Fanning used the w00w00 crowd as beta-testers for Napster. Another w00w00 contributor, Jordan Ritter, ended up heading the development of Napster's server software before he started anti-spam service Cloudmark and other companies.Koum was already working long hours to build up Yahoo's infrastructure and automate its defenses. His big test came when a Canadian teenager launched massive denial-of-service attacks on Yahoo and others, briefly rendering most of them unreachable. Known as MafiaBoy, the teen said after his arrest that he had directed hundreds of compromised university computer networks to connect to Yahoo simultaneously, overwhelming its resources. Having never met most of the w00w00 members in person, Koum nevertheless turned to them for help in a way that would be unthinkable for a top security executive today. One of those brainstorming with him was Song, who later became the founding architect of a major denial-of-service mitigation firm, Arbor Networks Inc.ENTER THE SPIES As most of the w00w00 membership took serious jobs, often at each other's companies, the security industry as a whole was splintering.Conover and others ended up at big companies such as Symantec Corp. Some old-school hackers picked fights with several w00w00 members, arguing that information about security flaws should not be published.Increasingly during the last decade, geopolitics entered into the picture. Spy agencies and military commanders realized the immense value of specialized software for breaking into and potentially disrupting enemy networks. Some hackers who were caught breaking the law said they were offered a choice between jail and government service.The apolitical Conover said he did not like it when U.S. authorities questioned him about his associations after he returned from a conference in China.Another w00w00 mainstay, Ralph Logan, became a consultant with both corporate and U.S. government security contracts, doling out work as a ""hostel for homeless hackers.""Others sold research on how to exploit various software to brokers, who sold it to military contractors. This way of earning a living bothered some w00w00ers on a philosophical level because the information was not shared widely to help shore up cyber defenses.""The people who understand vulnerabilities and how to exploit them are being co-opted into building offensive tools for national interests,"" Nuwere said. ""These are issues that hackers have faced in other countries for a long time.""Koum is among many w00w00ers who have left the security business. Logan has a big-data startup, Kiku Software. Conover's latest project is a virtualization company called CloudVolumes. Ritter hired Nuwere for a non-security stealth startup called Ivy Softworks.Though security was once a major breeding ground for important new companies, such departures suggest this might not be the case for long.""The barriers for entry to learning about hacking in the old sense are such that it doesn't allow for as much free expression and open research,"" Logan said. ""It's an unfortunate sign of maturity in the industry.""",2014-03-07,FB,"Fri Mar 7, 2014 | 5:20pm EST","FEATURE-Elite security posse fostered founders of WhatsApp, Napster",http://www.reuters.com//article/whatsapp-w00w-idUSL1N0M427420140307?type=companyNews
114,"   By Joseph Ax | NEW YORK  NEW YORK A New York businessman must face criminal fraud charges for trying to claim a billion-dollar stake in social media company Facebook Inc, a federal judge ruled on Friday.Paul Ceglia, 40, is accused of forging a 2003 contract with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg that supposedly entitled him to part ownership of the company.After an hour-long hearing in New York, U.S. District Judge Andrew Carter rejected Ceglia's request to throw out the charges, finding he had failed to meet the ""high standard"" needed to dismiss a grand jury indictment.Ceglia sued Zuckerberg and Facebook in 2010 in a federal court in Buffalo, New York, claiming that he and Zuckerberg had signed a contract while Zuckerberg was a freshman at Harvard University for Ceglia to invest $1,000 in a planned social networking website.Zuckerberg had previously done some programming work for Ceglia's company, StreetFax.com. Facebook has argued that the only contract between the two men was related to that company and accused Ceglia of faking various documents as part of his lawsuit.Last year, a magistrate judge in Buffalo recommended that Ceglia's lawsuit be dismissed, finding that it was ""highly probable and reasonably certain"" that the contract was fabricated in order to pursue the lawsuit. The federal judge overseeing the case has not yet ruled on that recommendation. Prosecutors in New York charged Ceglia in 2012, accusing him of forging documents as part of the Buffalo litigation.Ceglia has since filed a separate lawsuit against Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, whose office is prosecuting Ceglia, and U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder seeking to halt the criminal case.On Friday, Ceglia's defense attorney, David Patton, argued that the government should be barred from prosecuting him for allegations he made in the context of a civil lawsuit, warning that it could discourage litigants from filing claims. He also said the government's allegations do not constitute criminal fraud under federal law.""They're alleging that it's simply a phony, sham litigation,"" he said. ""That's not fraud.""Carter said the indictment was sufficient to move ahead, though he said he would consider Patton's arguments at a later date if the case goes to trial. Following the hearing, Ceglia vowed to press forward with his claims against Facebook, while his civil attorney, Joseph Alioto, said they would prove the Zuckerberg contract is legitimate.""Nothing is going to stop me,"" Ceglia said.Ceglia's lawsuit created a bizarre backdrop as Facebook marched toward its initial public offering in May 2013.

Another tool was the member-developed password cracker, John the Ripper.W00w00 members regularly spoke at the top security conventions. One of them, Jeff Forristal, under the handle ""Rain Forest Puppy,"" published guidelines for responsibly disclosing flaws to software vendors before the general public.Fanning used the w00w00 crowd as beta-testers for Napster. Another w00w00 contributor, Jordan Ritter, ended up heading the development of Napster's server software before he started anti-spam service Cloudmark and other companies.Koum was already working long hours to build up Yahoo's infrastructure and automate its defenses. His big test came when a Canadian teenager launched massive denial-of-service attacks on Yahoo and others, briefly rendering most of them unreachable. Known as MafiaBoy, the teen said after his arrest that he had directed hundreds of compromised university computer networks to connect to Yahoo simultaneously, overwhelming its resources. Having never met most of the w00w00 members in person, Koum nevertheless turned to them for help in a way that would be unthinkable for a top security executive today. One of those brainstorming with him was Song, who later became the founding architect of a major denial-of-service mitigation firm, Arbor Networks Inc.ENTER THE SPIES As most of the w00w00 membership took serious jobs, often at each other's companies, the security industry as a whole was splintering.Conover and others ended up at big companies such as Symantec Corp. Some old-school hackers picked fights with several w00w00 members, arguing that information about security flaws should not be published.Increasingly during the last decade, geopolitics entered into the picture. Spy agencies and military commanders realized the immense value of specialized software for breaking into and potentially disrupting enemy networks. Some hackers who were caught breaking the law said they were offered a choice between jail and government service.The apolitical Conover said he did not like it when U.S. authorities questioned him about his associations after he returned from a conference in China.Another w00w00 mainstay, Ralph Logan, became a consultant with both corporate and U.S. government security contracts, doling out work as a ""hostel for homeless hackers.""Others sold research on how to exploit various software to brokers, who sold it to military contractors. This way of earning a living bothered some w00w00ers on a philosophical level because the information was not shared widely to help shore up cyber defenses.""The people who understand vulnerabilities and how to exploit them are being co-opted into building offensive tools for national interests,"" Nuwere said. ""These are issues that hackers have faced in other countries for a long time.""Koum is among many w00w00ers who have left the security business. Logan has a big-data startup, Kiku Software. Conover's latest project is a virtualization company called CloudVolumes. Ritter hired Nuwere for a non-security stealth startup called Ivy Softworks.Though security was once a major breeding ground for important new companies, such departures suggest this might not be the case for long.""The barriers for entry to learning about hacking in the old sense are such that it doesn't allow for as much free expression and open research,"" Logan said. ""It's an unfortunate sign of maturity in the industry.""",2014-03-07,FB,"Fri Mar 7, 2014 | 6:00am EST","FEATURE-Elite security posse fostered founders of WhatsApp, Napster",http://www.reuters.com//article/whatsapp-w00w-idUSL1N0M310120140307?type=companyNews
119,"  * Turkish PM moots Facebook, YouTube ban amid leaked recordings* EMs unsettled by lack of progress in resolving Ukrainian crisis* Turkish Airlines posts 41 pct decline in y-o-y net profitBy Dasha AfanasievaISTANBUL, March 7 The Turkish lira slipped on Friday, rattled by Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan's comments on website bans being an option amid attacks from his political foes and as the Ukrainian crisis continued to weigh on emerging market sentiment.Late on Thursday, Erdogan said Turkey could ban Facebook  and YouTube after local elections on March 30, saying they have been abused by his political enemies with a series of voice recordings posted on the Internet purportedly revealing graft in his inner circle.A series of public challenges to the ruling AK Party have emerged since the launch of a corruption probe on Dec. 17, exposing a deep rift between Erdogan and former ally, U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen and rattling investors. ""We can attribute  the lira's negative differentiation to the politics, namely the prime minister's remarks from last night which is seen to indicate that political tension will remain elevated even after the local elections,"" said Gokce Celik, analyst at Finansbank.The political crisis in Ukraine capped gains in emerging markets after Russian President Vladimir Putin said Moscow and Washington were still far apart on the situation in Turkey's neighbour.""With vulnerabilities such as large external balances and political risks, Turkish assets tend to react more negatively when emerging market sentiment deteriorates,"" Celik said. The lira slipped to 2.1890 against the dollar by 0935 GMT from 2.1825 late on Thursday. The 10-year benchmark bond yield rose to 10.6 percent from 10.54 percent on Thursday.The main Istanbul share index was up 0.18 percent at 64,119.97 points, underperforming the wider emerging markets index, which rose 0.17 percent.The biggest drag on the index came from flag carrier Turkish Airlines which posted a net profit of 683 million lira ($313 million) in 2013, down 41 percent from a year earlier and sharply below an average forecast of 947 million lira in a Reuters poll. Meanwhile airports operator TAV Havalimanlari Holding   got a boost after saying it will bid for the tender of Dalaman Airport operating rights on Friday.In addition, investors were cautious ahead of the U.S. non farm payrolls report (1330 GMT), which was forecast to show an increase of around 149,000 in February, according to a Reuters survey of economists, up from the weather-depressed gains of 113,000 in January and 75,000 in December.Jobs data from the world's biggest economy is eyed closely by emerging markets for any clues on the pace of Federal Reserve tapering. Turkey is vulnerable to cuts in asset buying because of its gaping current account deficit, which is financed through cheap capital inflows.Last month Fed chair Janet Yellen made it clear she would not make any abrupt changes to U.S. monetary policy, saying the central bank was on track to keep reducing its stimulus even though the labour market recovery was far from complete.""The importance of the non farm payroll, on its own, has diminished since the tapering actually started, but it is still a closely watched indicator,"" Celik said.",2014-03-07,FB,"Fri Mar 7, 2014 | 5:01am EST","Ukraine crisis, domestic politics weigh on Turkish assets",http://www.reuters.com//article/markets-turkey-idUSL6N0M413I20140307?type=companyNews
120,"   By Miyoung Kim and Andjarsari Paramaditha | SEOUL/JAKARTA, March 10  SEOUL/JAKARTA, March 10 South Korea's pioneering mobile messaging apps have taken their oversized emoticons to Indonesia, intent on breaking the dominance of BlackBerry Ltd's  BBM messaging service in one of the world's most active social media markets.Kakao Corp has hired pop stars and Naver Corp  unit Line Corp has partnered Samsung Electronics Co  in a country whose capital Jakarta boasts the most users of Twitter Inc's microblog by city, according to researcher McKinsey & Company.BBM has long been Indonesia's most popular messaging app, with Facebook Inc's $19 billion buyout target WhatsApp in pursuit. But KakaoTalk and Line have connected with younger users by also offering voice calls, games, shopping, merchandise and stickers, or message-conveying cartoons.Under-30s make up over half of the 240 million Indonesians, where just 20 percent use smartphones, making the country a prime growth market for app makers. Estimates put smartphone use at 50 percent before the end of the decade, by which time messaging apps' global revenue could be over $24 billion.""Indonesia is probably the most competitive mobile messenger market right now... And it's a key market we want to win,"" said Kate Sohn, vice president of Kakao's global business development division.KakaoTalk has gained 16 million users in just one year in Indonesia after Kakao signed an advertising deal with Big Bang - a K-Pop boy band popular in Indonesia - and started offering unlimited KakaoTalk data through carrier Telkomsel.KakaoTalk, whose maker plans to list in Korea around May next year, was Indonesia's 37th most downloaded free app on Apple Inc's App Store as of March 7, and 14th on Google Inc's Google Play, according to researcher App Annie.BBM was first on both since becoming available through those stores in October. Broadening compatibility freed BBM users from BlackBerry handsets, and left BlackBerry with just 5 percent of Indonesia's smartphone market in October-December from 34 percent a year earlier.""BlackBerry's falling domination... has made Indonesia more dynamic and created a big opportunity for new entrants,"" said Kakao's Sohn. ""Indonesia has the right mix of big scale, growing number of smartphone users and the market is really in flux."" SAMSUNG CONNECTION Line entered Indonesia in early 2012 and has 20 million users thanks partly to it being pre-installed on some smartphones running Microsoft Corp's Windows Phone and Google's Android operating systems, including models from Samsung. Samsung sells about one of every three smartphones sold in Indonesia, and from this month its entire Galaxy range will have Line pre-installed.""We've done lots of collaboration with Samsung and are benefiting from their growing brand strength and volume shipments,"" said Simeon Cho, general manager at Line Plus, which handles Line's business outside of its biggest market Japan.Line is also likely to be pre-installed on Nokia's first Android smartphones targeting the low-end segment popular in emerging markets such as Indonesia, and which researcher IDC expects to lead global smartphone growth.As for global revenue growth, Macquarie Group said in a March 5 report that income from advertising, games and stickers could push messaging apps' revenue to $24 billion within three years, rather than the $10 billion the finance house forecast in September. MAKING IT STICK The proliferation of messaging apps has spawned features such as stickers and in-app shopping as makers seek to be different. It has also resulted in users downloading multiple apps to accommodate contacts' preferences.""Customers contact me through BBM, WhatsApp and email,"" said Saskia Tamat, 37, who runs a catering business in Jakarta.""A lot of my friends also use Line, and we send each other stickers instead of just texting. I downloaded KakaoTalk, because I watch a lot of Korean dramas and movies and saw they use cute stickers.""KakaoTalk's journey up the ranks will also see it contend with WeChat from Tencent Holdings Ltd. Tencent established a joint venture last year with Indonesia's biggest media group, Global Mediacom Tbk PT, and is advertising heavily on television.""It is interesting to see the battle of messenger apps in Indonesia because it's an open field,"" said Enda Nasution, social media analyst and founder of social media platform Sebangsa Bersama.Leader BBM looks far from willing to surrender. The market appears so important to BlackBerry that the company has code-named its low-end smartphone Z3 ""Jakarta"" which it plans to launch first in Indonesia in April.""Indonesians still have a strong emotional attachment to BBM. Though its growth rate appears to be slowing, many think it won't completely go away any time soon,"" said Line Plus' Cho.

125,"   By Jennifer Saba  Readers of some of the top U.S. news sites are more engaged when they go directly to the website rather than through Facebook, according to a study from the Pew Research Center released on Monday.The research found that users who come directly to a news site spend about three times as long per visit, or almost five minutes on average. Those who find the news by searching or through Facebook spend about two minutes.Direct visitors also view about five times as many pages per month as those coming through Facebook referrals or through search engines such as Google Inc.The study is revealing because increasingly news organizations are relying on social media platforms to distribute content especially to reach younger readers.And yet the research shows that those readers who come to an article or video through Facebook are younger and more fickle in their loyalties. The Pew study, conducted in collaboration with the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, analyzed Internet traffic from online measurement firm comScore Inc to 26 of the most popular news sites during April, May and June of 2013. They included sites owned by Yahoo Inc, AOL Inc's Huffington Post, Twenty-First Century Fox Inc's Fox News, the New York Times Co, BuzzFeed and the BBC.The report looked at three ways people come to news articles: directly, through Facebook and through searching.The study analyzed the online reading behavior of 1 million people who use desktop or laptop computers. Data from a smaller group of readers on smartphones and mobile devices suggested a similar pattern, the authors said. ""Converting social media or search eyeballs to dedicated readers is difficult to do,"" the authors of the report wrote.""Even sites such as digital native BuzzFeed and National Public Radio's npr.org, which have an unusually high level of Facebook traffic, saw much greater engagement from those who came in directly.""Some of the sites that exhibited high levels of engagement included Foxnews.com, where the average visitor spent almost eight minutes per visit. By comparison, the average visitor to CNN spent about a minute and a half. The range of sites getting referral traffic from Facebook varied. The New York Times for instance gets 37 percent of its traffic from direct visitors and only 7 percent from Facebook.BuzzFeed receives 32 percent of its referrals directly while 50 percent are from Facebook.""Facebook and search are critical for bringing added eyeballs to individual stories, and they do so in droves,"" the authors wrote.""But the connection a news organization has with any individual coming to their website via search or Facebook is quite limited.""(Reporting by Jennifer Saba in New York; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)",2014-03-13,FB,"Thu Mar 13, 2014 | 12:06am EDT",U.S. news readers less engaged when referred by Facebook: study,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-pewstudy-news-idUSBREA2C08V20140313?type=companyNews
126,"  HONG KONG, March 15 China's e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd is planning a U.S. IPO in the third quarter of this year, people familiar  with the matter told Reuters, in what is the expected to be a more than $15 billion deal.The Hangzhou, China-based company, which controls about 80 percent of the country's e-commerce, had been in discussions with the Hong Kong stock exchange and the Securities and Futures Commission since last year about a potential listing, but the island city's regulators blocked its proposal as it violated the ""one-share-one-vote principle"".After an initial rebuff, Alibaba and the Hong Kong regulators were back at the negotiating table late last year, to find a solution to the vexed problem. While the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd has initiated a review of its listing rules to accommodate more flexible structures, any change to the existing rules would take months.Alibaba does not want to miss the technology boom, which has boosted valuations of Internet companies both in the United States and in Hong Kong. Alibaba's planned IPO would be the highest-profile Internet listing since Facebook Inc's $16 billion deal in 2012.It was not entirely clear if talks between Alibaba and the Hong Kong regulators have completely ceased, but the chances of a Hong Kong listing looks increasingly unlikely, the people added.The sources declined to be identified as the information is not public. Alibaba could file listing documents with the U.S. regulators as soon as April, one of the people said. The deal is crucial for investment banks as it is estimated it will generate $260 million in underwriting fees, Reuters previously reported.""There is no timeline, no venue selected nor have any underwriters been hired for an IPO event,"" an Alibaba spokeswoman said. 'NO CHANGE TO STRUCTURE' The listing also is closely watched by Alibaba's two largest shareholders - Yahoo Inc which owns 24 percent and Japan's Softbank Corp which controls 37 percent. Alibaba's founders and some senior managers jointly own about 13 percent of the company, which analysts estimate is worth at least $140 billion. Credit Suisse and Morgan Stanley are among the two banks poised to win top underwriting mandates, while other banks are also expected to join the syndicate, the people familiar with the matter added.Alibaba's corporate structure allows a group of top partners to nominate and control the board, which is at odds with Hong Kong's stock exchange's listing rules.Joe Tsai, Alibaba's executive vice chairman told Reuters in an interview this week the company would not change its partnership structure in order to list on the Hong Kong stock exchange.""The one thing I can't understand is people think we're going to change our partnership structure just to accommodate a listing in Hong Kong, that's never going to happen,"" said Tsai.Credit Suisse and Morgan Stanley did not reply to emails seeking comment.",2014-03-15,FB,"Sat Mar 15, 2014 | 2:18am EDT",Alibaba Group seeking US listing in Q3 - sources,http://www.reuters.com//article/alibaba-group-ipo-idUSL3N0MC04L20140315?type=companyNews
127,"  * Share of China online retail fell for first time in 2013* IPO in U.S. could exceed Facebook's $16 bln in value* Tencent, JD.com tie-up sharpens e-commerce challenge* Niche players, retail brands also step up competitionBy Adam JourdanSHANGHAI, March 17 Alibaba's dominance of online retail in China faces its biggest-ever challenge as the firm founded by Jack Ma in a one-room apartment 15 years ago lines up a U.S. initial public offering that could value the firm at around $140 billion.In a rare blip, Alibaba Group Holdings lost market share last year while its nearest rivals all grew, according to Euromonitor. The market research firm sees China's internet retail market tripling from 2012 to over $300 billion in 2018 as the country's smartphone-savvy shoppers buy everything from plane tickets to sneakers online.China's biggest social media company, Tencent Holdings Ltd , is leading the revolt, linking the country's most popular messaging app, WeChat, with the number two e-commerce player, JD.com.An array of smaller rivals is also clawing away at Alibaba's lead, while household retail names like Nike Inc and Gap Inc are increasingly striking out away from the giant's Tmall electronic platform to set up more distinctive online stores of their own.""In China shopping is a social activity. You want to tell friends about it, recommend it - it's a smartphone activity, and whoever owns that organisational ability also has a hold over how a person shops,"" said Frank Lavin, Hong Kong-based chief executive of Export Now. Lavin's company helps global firms set up shop in China through Alibaba's Tmall.Alibaba's e-commerce prospects at home loom large after Ma's firm said on Sunday it was starting plans for a long-awaited listing in the U.S. - potentially the biggest-ever IPO by an Internet company - which could surpass the $16 billion raised by social media giant Facebook Inc in 2012.Alibaba still held a sturdy 45.1 percent of China's e-commerce market last year, down from 46.1 percent a year earlier, according to Euromonitor, and remains bullish in the face of Tencent, JD.com and others. It is beefing up its mobile services to keep up with China's legions of smartphone users.Alibaba did not respond to repeated requests for comment for this story, though the firm's executive vice chairman Joe Tsai was upbeat about the firm's e-commerce prospects in an interview with Reuters in Hong Kong last week. PEELING AWAY Alibaba is now battling rivals on multiple fronts. Alongside JD.com, heading for a $1.5 billion IPO of its own in the U.S., are well-funded vehicles like household appliance retailer Suning Commerce Group Co Ltd and Wal-Mart Stores Inc's grocery retailer Yihaodian.Smaller niche players like cosmetics specialist Vipshop Holdings Ltd are also growing in stature. And with global and local brands peeling away from Tmall, the trend is likely to see Alibaba's market share extend its fall, said Bryan Wang, Beijing-based vice president for Forrester Research.""We have definitely seen a lot more customers asking us in the last year about how to get away from Tmall,"" said Wang.Popular Internet clothing retailer HSTYLE has partly flown the nest. Competing with brands like H&M and Uniqlo, it has branched out from just having a Tmall outlet and now books half its sales through its own site and on JD.com and Tencent.""As a mature Internet brand we're looking to provide more individual service to our shoppers,"" Zhao Yingguang, founder and chairman of HSTYLE, told Reuters in an interview, describing his brand as one of the leading women's apparel retailers on Alibaba's platforms. ""We go and sell our products where the consumers are."" RIVALS RISING Alibaba's vast resources have helped it see off weaker players so far such as Otto Group, 139shop.com, Mecox Lane, Newegg.com and others, but the remaining contenders are more seasoned in competition with Alibaba - and ambitious.JD.com still lags some way behind Alibaba in second place with a 14 percent market share last year, up fractionally from a year earlier. But its IPO plans and the deal with Tencent - a less well-known name outside China than Alibaba, but worth almost $150 billion by market value - will give it new financial and operational resources.Tencent, meanwhile, hopes its JD.com tie-up will help it to extend its presence in ""the fast-growing physical goods e-commerce market"", Tencent president Martin Lau said in a statement. The deal also arms JD.com with the 225 million monthly active users of the WeChat messaging service in China.As well as technology leading change, consumers themselves are developing new habits, becoming more picky and looking to get more for their money.""I am leaning toward specialist stores now, because the service is often better than the giant retailers and the delivery I always find is faster,"" said Grace Lin, 20, a student in Shanghai. ""It's not necessarily that I use Tmall less now, but I do use other stores more."" Lin often shops on cosmetics specialist Vipshop's online site. The firm saw revenue climb 145 percent in 2013, while customer numbers shot up 130 percent over the same period, according to an earnings conference call this month. Vipshop almost doubled its market share to 1.8 percent last year.Suning, a traditional electronics retailer with a strong bricks and mortar presence, is bulking up its online presence, as is rival Bain Capital-backed Gome Electrical Appliances Holding Ltd. Both raised their market share last year.Yihaodian leverages majority owner Wal-Mart's global name and product range, while other niche players such as Jumei and Yesmywine.com corner specific markets in cosmetics and alcohol.MA VS MA Alibaba's Jack Ma has locked horns repeatedly of late with his rival at Tencent, co-founder Pony Ma - a namesake but unrelated. Rhetoric from the two internet giants has grown increasingly barbed as competition has raged from gaming and microblogs, to taxi hire app price wars and online payment systems that are now the subject of close scrutiny by China's central bank.When Tencent launched a ""red envelope"" feature for WeChat, which let users send money gifts by smartphone over the Chinese New Year, Jack Ma wrote it was a ""Pearl Harbour attack"" on his company's Alipay payment system, referring to the unexpected bombing of the American port during World War II. Tencent said over 8 million people used the WeChat feature.Alibaba-invested Weibo Corp, a popular Twitter-like social media platform, filed for a $500 million U.S. IPO of its own on Friday, as it looks to defend its position against fierce competition from Tencent's WeChat.WeChat does indeed present a threat to Alibaba.

Morgan, and Morgan Stanley for lead underwriting roles.Most of the six banks are to set to win the coveted role of joint global coordinator, added the sources, who were not authorised to discuss the matter publicly. Analysts estimate the Hangzhou, China-based company has a value of at least $140 billion, and the IPO proceeds could exceed $15 billion, Reuters previously reported. The deal would be a huge coup for the six banks, as it would yield an estimated $260 million in underwriting fees, assuming 1.75 percent commission, and catapult them in league table rankings.Alibaba declined to comment on the  banks working on the deal. The banks mentioned in the report either declined comment or did not respond to Reuters' requests for a comment.""This will be a huge deal, bigger than what people were anticipating,"" one person familiar with the process said, adding that the IPO was expected to be kicked off ""very soon"".Reuters reported on Saturday that Alibaba is planning a U.S. IPO in the third quarter, with a filing of documents expected as early as April. BILLIONAIRE MA Alibaba, whose platforms handle more goods than EBay Inc  and Amazon.com Inc combined, was founded in 1999 by former English teacher Jack Ma and 17 other people. It has grown from a startup in Ma's apartment to a behemoth with offices around the world and more than 20,000 employees.The listing will be closely watched by Alibaba's two largest shareholders - Yahoo Inc, which owns 24 percent, and Japan's Softbank Corp, which controls 37 percent. Alibaba's founders and some senior managers jointly own about 13 percent of the company. Yahoo has said it plans to trim its stake in Alibaba through the IPO. It initially invested in Alibaba in 2005.Alibaba's decision to go to the United States is a blow to the Hong Kong stock exchange, which was initially the company's preferred venue for the IPO.Alibaba also said in a statement on its corporate news Web site it might consider extending its public status to Chinese capital markets in future in order for investors there to be able to share in its growth.Alibaba, which controls about 80 percent of the country's e-commerce, had been in discussions with the Hong Kong stock exchange and the Securities and Futures Commission since last year about a listing, but the island city's regulators blocked its proposal as it violated the ""one-share-one-vote principle"".Alibaba's executive vice chairman Joe Tsai upped the rhetoric against Hong Kong when he told Reuters last week that the firm would not change its partnership structure in order to list on the Hong Kong stock exchange.After an initial rebuff, Alibaba and the Hong Kong regulators were back at the negotiating table late last year, to find a solution to the problem. While the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd has initiated a review of its listing rules to accommodate more flexible structures, any change to the existing rules would take months.""We wish to thank those in Hong Kong who have supported Alibaba Group,"" Alibaba said in its statement.""We respect the viewpoints and policies of Hong Kong and will continue to pay close attention to and support the process of innovation and development of Hong Kong.""",2014-03-16,FB,"Sun Mar 16, 2014 | 6:39am EDT",UPDATE 2-Alibaba picks US for IPO; in talks with six banks for lead roles,http://www.reuters.com//article/alibaba-ipo-idUSL3N0MD05P20140316?type=companyNews
129,"   By David Randall | NEW YORK  NEW YORK The last time email could be called a sexy business, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg was celebrating his tenth birthday. Yet Proofpoint Inc, a $1.6 billion market cap email security company, is catching the eye of fund managers by gaining share in a market that many investors have left for dead.Twenty-six small-cap funds added Proofpoint to their portfolios over the last quarter, a nearly 15 percent increase from the quarter before, Morningstar data show. A total of 249 funds own the stock, a level analysts say is unusually high for a company with a market value of its size that has yet to show a profit.The interest comes amid a renewed corporate focus on protection against hackers and state-sponsored cyber attacks following well-publicized data breaches at several retailers and financial firms. Six of the 10 largest breaches in history have occurred over the last year.About 95 percent of targeted attacks begin with so-called phishing attempts - bogus emails designed to trick users into entering their log-in information or other sensitive data, according to a 2013 report by Verizon Communications Inc on data breaches.At the same time, the dominant providers of security software have made missteps that allowed Proofpoint to gain market share, analysts say.Intel Corp's security division (which until recently was known as McAfee) ""gave themselves a very black eye"" by waiting three years between software upgrades, said Rick Holland, an analyst at Forrester Research.Google Inc shut down its Postini business and expected to migrate those customers into its Google Apps product, but the company was ""a little overzealous in its estimates of how quickly people were going to adopt"" the change, Holland said.Rivals dedicated to email security got bought by bigger firms, leaving Proofpoint the only pure-play email security provider, said Peter Firstbrook, a vice president with research firm Gartner who advises companies on email technology.""It's like the Red Sea parted from a competitive standpoint,"" said John Bichelmeyer, lead portfolio manager of the $563 million Buffalo Emerging Opportunities fund.Proofpoint, based in Sunnyvale, California, is one of only two rapidly growing email security firms, along with Microsoft Corp, in a market worth about $1.7 billion in 2012, according to Gartner. Proofpoint had 6 percent market share in 2012, versus 22 percent for Cisco Systems Inc, 20 for Symantec Corp and 8 percent for Microsoft. Gartner has yet to release data for 2013. Proofpoint's gains could make it an acquisition target by a larger company hoping to expand its reach, even though its stock price has jumped 25.5 percent so far this year, analysts said.""I thought they would have been acquired a long time ago,"" said Holland.HIGH TARGETS BUT NO PROFITS Analysts tracked by Reuters are largely bullish on the company, though they expect it to continue posting losses a couple more years. Thirteen out of the 14 analysts who cover the company rate it as a 'strong buy' or 'buy,' while Robert Breza at Stern, Agee & Leach rates it a 'hold.' At Thursday's closing price of $41.63, Proofpoint's stock was 12.4 percent below analysts' median target of $46.81.The company, which went public in 2012 at $13 a share, posted revenues of $176 million in its latest fiscal year. Analysts tracked by Thomson Reuters estimate a loss of 18 cents per share, on revenues on $40.7 million, when it releases its quarterly results on April 21. It trades at a forward price to book value of 32.2. Tim Klassel, an analyst at Northland Capital Markets expects a loss per share of 50 cents this fiscal year and 28 cents next year.PURE PLAY Fund managers like Bichelmeyer, who has been adding to his position, say the company is seen as the only pure-play investment in the cloud-based security market, a relatively new industry that FBR Capital Markets expects to grow into a $7 billion market.Proofpoint is rated as one of the top two providers of corporate email security products by Gartner, whose recommendations are closely watched by technology buyers.""Proofpoint lives or dies by email, so they are more focused on their customers,"" Firstbrook said. ""If you are an email administrator you want to work with somebody who is really focused on this problem over somebody focused on generic security and networking problems."" Holland, who also advises companies on email security technology, said Proofpoint has developed strong loyalty among returning customers.""I have found that some customers may adopt Microsoft or Google and drop something like Proofpoint, but six months later they go back and have Proofpoint sitting in front because it is more robust,"" he said.Yet email administrators do not always get to make the final decision on which products their companies purchase.Cisco maintains it has an advantage over Proofpoint because it offers a broad line of security products that protect businesses across their network, from firewall to desktop computers.""Malware gets through every day.

""Email security has vaulted to the top of priority list for CIOs, and Proofpoint has established themselves as the clear leader,"" said Ives, who raised his target price for the company to $49 to $47 on March 10.For Proofpoint to continue its gains, management has to avoid the trap of email security firms made by expanding into other business lines, said Ives, the FBR analyst.""This is a high growth environment. The downfall of companies in the past is when they don't stay focused and try to expand into other areas,"" he said.

131,"  * Share of China online retail fell for first time in 2013* IPO in U.S. could exceed Facebook's $16 bln in value* Tencent, JD.com tie-up sharpens e-commerce challenge* Niche players, retail brands also step up competitionBy Adam JourdanSHANGHAI, March 17 Alibaba's dominance of online retail in China faces its biggest-ever challenge as the firm founded by Jack Ma in a one-room apartment 15 years ago lines up a U.S. initial public offering that could value the firm at around $140 billion.In a rare blip, Alibaba Group Holdings lost market share last year while its nearest rivals all grew, according to Euromonitor. The market research firm sees China's internet retail market tripling from 2012 to over $300 billion in 2018 as the country's smartphone-savvy shoppers buy everything from plane tickets to sneakers online.China's biggest social media company, Tencent Holdings Ltd , is leading the revolt, linking the country's most popular messaging app, WeChat, with the number two e-commerce player, JD.com.An array of smaller rivals is also clawing away at Alibaba's lead, while household retail names like Nike Inc and Gap Inc are increasingly striking out away from the giant's Tmall electronic platform to set up more distinctive online stores of their own.""In China shopping is a social activity. You want to tell friends about it, recommend it - it's a smartphone activity, and whoever owns that organisational ability also has a hold over how a person shops,"" said Frank Lavin, Hong Kong-based chief executive of Export Now. Lavin's company helps global firms set up shop in China through Alibaba's Tmall.Alibaba's e-commerce prospects at home loom large after Ma's firm said on Sunday it was starting plans for a long-awaited listing in the U.S. - potentially the biggest-ever IPO by an Internet company - which could surpass the $16 billion raised by social media giant Facebook Inc in 2012.Alibaba still held a sturdy 45.1 percent of China's e-commerce market last year, down from 46.1 percent a year earlier, according to Euromonitor, and remains bullish in the face of Tencent, JD.com and others. It is beefing up its mobile services to keep up with China's legions of smartphone users.Alibaba did not respond to repeated requests for comment for this story, though the firm's executive vice chairman Joe Tsai was upbeat about the firm's e-commerce prospects in an interview with Reuters in Hong Kong last week. PEELING AWAY Alibaba is now battling rivals on multiple fronts. Alongside JD.com, heading for a $1.5 billion IPO of its own in the U.S., are well-funded vehicles like household appliance retailer Suning Commerce Group Co Ltd and Wal-Mart Stores Inc's grocery retailer Yihaodian.Smaller niche players like cosmetics specialist Vipshop Holdings Ltd are also growing in stature. And with global and local brands peeling away from Tmall, the trend is likely to see Alibaba's market share extend its fall, said Bryan Wang, Beijing-based vice president for Forrester Research.""We have definitely seen a lot more customers asking us in the last year about how to get away from Tmall,"" said Wang.Popular Internet clothing retailer HSTYLE has partly flown the nest. Competing with brands like H&M and Uniqlo, it has branched out from just having a Tmall outlet and now books half its sales through its own site and on JD.com and Tencent.""As a mature Internet brand we're looking to provide more individual service to our shoppers,"" Zhao Yingguang, founder and chairman of HSTYLE, told Reuters in an interview, describing his brand as one of the leading women's apparel retailers on Alibaba's platforms. ""We go and sell our products where the consumers are."" RIVALS RISING Alibaba's vast resources have helped it see off weaker players so far such as Otto Group, 139shop.com, Mecox Lane, Newegg.com and others, but the remaining contenders are more seasoned in competition with Alibaba - and ambitious.JD.com still lags some way behind Alibaba in second place with a 14 percent market share last year, up fractionally from a year earlier. But its IPO plans and the deal with Tencent - a less well-known name outside China than Alibaba, but worth almost $150 billion by market value - will give it new financial and operational resources.Tencent, meanwhile, hopes its JD.com tie-up will help it to extend its presence in ""the fast-growing physical goods e-commerce market"", Tencent president Martin Lau said in a statement. The deal also arms JD.com with the 225 million monthly active users of the WeChat messaging service in China.As well as technology leading change, consumers themselves are developing new habits, becoming more picky and looking to get more for their money.""I am leaning toward specialist stores now, because the service is often better than the giant retailers and the delivery I always find is faster,"" said Grace Lin, 20, a student in Shanghai. ""It's not necessarily that I use Tmall less now, but I do use other stores more."" Lin often shops on cosmetics specialist Vipshop's online site. The firm saw revenue climb 145 percent in 2013, while customer numbers shot up 130 percent over the same period, according to an earnings conference call this month. Vipshop almost doubled its market share to 1.8 percent last year.Suning, a traditional electronics retailer with a strong bricks and mortar presence, is bulking up its online presence, as is rival Bain Capital-backed Gome Electrical Appliances Holding Ltd. Both raised their market share last year.Yihaodian leverages majority owner Wal-Mart's global name and product range, while other niche players such as Jumei and Yesmywine.com corner specific markets in cosmetics and alcohol.MA VS MA Alibaba's Jack Ma has locked horns repeatedly of late with his rival at Tencent, co-founder Pony Ma - a namesake but unrelated. Rhetoric from the two internet giants has grown increasingly barbed as competition has raged from gaming and microblogs, to taxi hire app price wars and online payment systems that are now the subject of close scrutiny by China's central bank.When Tencent launched a ""red envelope"" feature for WeChat, which let users send money gifts by smartphone over the Chinese New Year, Jack Ma wrote it was a ""Pearl Harbour attack"" on his company's Alipay payment system, referring to the unexpected bombing of the American port during World War II. Tencent said over 8 million people used the WeChat feature.Alibaba-invested Weibo Corp, a popular Twitter-like social media platform, filed for a $500 million U.S. IPO of its own on Friday, as it looks to defend its position against fierce competition from Tencent's WeChat.WeChat does indeed present a threat to Alibaba. In a research report in December, Standard Chartered said its payment function, known in Chinese as Weixin, paired with its wide popularity, could be a ""killer weapon"" for Tencent to take market share in mobile e-commerce.China has some of the most active mobile web users in the world. The country's mobile Internet users hit 500 million in 2013, and is estimated to hit 750 million by 2017, according to data from China-based consultancy iResearch.""The wind is blowing against Alibaba and the biggest risk is coming from the mobile sector,"" said Zhang Chenhao, executive director at e-commmerce-focused investment advisory firm Gold Sand Capital.""Firms are all lining up - the school of Tencent or the school of Alibaba - and the camps are forming,"" said Zhang.",2014-03-17,FB,"Mon Mar 17, 2014 | 1:39am EDT","RPT-As giant U.S. IPO nears, Alibaba's China e-commerce crown slips",http://www.reuters.com//article/china-ecommerce-idUSL3N0ME17U20140317?type=companyNews

137,"  * Tech giant only gave up hope of HK IPO recently -sources* Negotiations with HK regulators, exchange lasted a year* HK public consultation delay affected decision -sources   (Updates to clarify Alibaba's statement in paragraph 12)By Denny Thomas and Elzio BarretoHONG KONG, March 19 After a year of waiting, the man running what could be the biggest-ever technology IPO finally lost patience with Hong Kong.Joe Tsai, the Alibaba Group Holding executive in charge of plans for the highly anticipated deal, only abandoned hope of a Hong Kong listing in the last few weeks, according to people familiar with the matter. The company's shareholding structure, giving senior managers sway over board appointments, would not pass muster with local regulators.The final straw was the snail's pace of a public consultation process of reviewing local listing rules on which Alibaba had pinned its hopes, the people said. That delay, coupled with a rush of Alibaba rivals seeking to tap the frothy U.S. tech market, forced the company's hand in the end, the people said.Last Sunday, after nearly a year of talks with Hong Kong regulators and stock exchange officials, Alibaba said it will list shares in the United States in a deal expected to exceed Facebook Inc's $16 billion offering in 2012.""Alibaba realized this was not a battle that they could have won within the time frame they were looking to float the company,"" said Keith Pogson, managing partner for financial services at consulting firm EY in Hong Kong. ""So they decided to find a home that was more accommodating with such structures.""Alibaba's choice is a blow to Hong Kong's financial industry, in terms of lost prestige, fees and trading volumes. The absence of a large, dynamic tech company will sting the Hong Kong exchange as it tries to diversify its publicly traded stocks away from Greater China financial and property companies, bolstering its status as a global financial centre.Hong Kong's loss is the U.S. financial industry's gain. The deal has the potential to bring in about $300 million in advisory fees alone for the banks involved, based on an estimated 1.75 percent commission.The saga pitted a Chinese tech juggernaut and its financial advisors against securities officials guarding rigid shareholding rules meant to protect retail investor interests with a one share-one vote guarantee, in a city where family-run businesses and tycoons hold heavy influence.""It's a shame that Hong Kong lost the deal, but we lost the deal for good reasons,"" said EY's Pogson. ""So we should congratulate the Hong Kong regulators for sticking to their guns on values, for showing that Hong Kong is a robust market where these kind of issues do matter and people care about investor protection.""Alibaba had held out hope that a review of Hong Kong's shareholding rules would keep the door open for a listing in the city, the people familiar said.But the public consultation moved slowly, with Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) pushing back against the stock exchange's original draft proposals for a raft of rule changes. The SFC was adamant that the proposed changes to the city's listing rules should not be influenced by Alibaba's hopes for a Hong Kong listing, the people familiar said. Alibaba said it would not add to its Sunday statement, which said a U.S. IPO ""will make us a more global company and enhance the company's transparency.""FORGING AHEAD The original plan to list late in 2013 had already gone by the wayside last year in part because of SFC opposition to Alibaba's unique corporate structure. Under Alibaba's statutes, the company's partners are able to nominate and control the board - a challenge to the one share-one vote standard applied in Hong Kong.While Alibaba waited for Hong Kong regulators to make a decision, Tsai and company co-founder Jack Ma could see that not only were the stocks of U.S. tech giants like Facebook and Google Inc surging, but that smaller Chinese Internet companies such as JD.com and Weibo were forging ahead with their own U.S. listing plans.The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite index has jumped 34 percent over the past year, and has featured IPO candidates in the last year that have stoked views that the index is reaching bubble levels.As the stalemate with Hong Kong regulators dragged on, there was concern within Alibaba's camp that the market's appetite for what could be one of the largest IPOs ever would wane the deeper into 2014 the deal moved, people familiar with the matter say. Alibaba has yet to say which U.S. exchange it hopes to use, or confirm a timetable for the sale. A listing on either the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq could come as soon as the end of July, people familiar with the matter say.A listing in New York would mean scrutiny from U.S. regulators and class action lawyers. Yet it would also mean access to bigger pools of money from investors with deep knowledge of the technology sector, possibly boosting Alibaba's valuation.Alibaba's largest shareholders are Internet services company Yahoo Inc with 24 percent and Japanese telecoms and media company Softbank Corp with 37 percent. Based on the average of 12 analysts, Alibaba is estimated to have a market value of $141 billion.Based on that valuation, and Yahoo selling half its stake, as previously agreed, the IPO could raise more than $17 billion.TURF WAR The stance by Hong Kong's SFC against Alibaba's partnership structure surfaced last year, through a series of private meetings. People familiar with the matter said that Alibaba representatives met the SFC several times throughout the year, but no progress toward a compromise ever materialised. One way around that impasse was a proposal by the Hong Kong stock exchange to alter the city's shareholding rules to make them more flexible.If the stock exchange, together with input from the market, could draft new shareholder rules with the SFC's approval, a window for an Alibaba IPO would remain open. Given the months that such public consultation processes take, Alibaba still could have secured a deal by the end of 2014, people familiar with the matter say.Instead, Alibaba got stuck in the middle of a turf war between the stock exchange and the SFC, a person familiar with the matter said.The stock exchange operator, known officially as Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd, or HKEx, drafted a consultation paper on the rule changes and sent it to the SFC earlier this year, hoping to kickstart the process. But the SFC sent the draft paper back to the HKEx last month, proposing a series of changes.""The SFC didn't want the HKEx to rush through the consultation paper. It was pushing back and telling the exchange, 'You guys are not the decision-makers,'"" said the person, who was not authorized to speak to the media.The SFC declined to comment. The HKEx said a discussion paper on weighted voting rights and other topics would not be published this quarter.RUSHED RELEASE One person familiar with the matter said that before making the official decision to move the listing to the U.S., Alibaba would have contacted Chinese authorities to let them know of their choice. Beijing officials preferred to have the company listed and regulated in Hong Kong, rather than overseas.Sunday's statement announcing plans for an IPO in the U.S. was the first time the company had ever officially acknowledged its stock offering, and the first time it pinpointed the location.People familiar with the matter say that Alibaba did not plan to issue the release, but that rumors and media reports were swirling. Management decided to finally put speculation to rest.The announcement came only after Alibaba's senior vice president and head of corporate finance, Michael Yao, a former Rothschild banker, led phone calls to the investment banks courting the company for months, informing them they would play a role in the deal, people familiar with the matter said.Citigroup, Credit Suisse Deutsche Bank , Goldman Sachs, J.P.

139,"   By Gerry Shih | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Tango, the mobile messaging app-maker, announced Wednesday it has raised $280 million in a new funding round led by Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.By almost any measure, the investment amounted to a staggering sum for a mobile app developer. The deal, which came one month after Facebook Inc's stunning $19 billion acquisition of Whatsapp, underscored the lengths that Internet companies are willing to go to gain a foothold in mobile communications.Alibaba invested $215 million while the remainder of the funding came from Tango's prior investors, which include Access Industries, Draper Fisher Jurvetson and Jerry Yang, a co-founder of Yahoo Inc, Tango said.The investment gives Alibaba a minority stake in a messaging service with 200 million registered users and 70 million active users. Tango claims significant traction in North America, the Middle East, Taiwan and Singapore. Alibaba, which views Chinese rival Tencent as its most serious competitor, has long recognized the threat posed by Tencent Holding's WeChat, a massively popular messaging app that has slowly morphed into an e-commerce platform. Alibaba recently introduced a WeChat competitor called Laiwang, but the service has so far struggled to the extent that Alibaba founder Jack Ma, according to various media reports, urged Alibaba's entire workforce last year to recruit new users.Tango is the latest in a string of investments for Alibaba, which is preparing for an highly anticipated initial public offering in New York that could value the company at $200 billion. MESSAGING WARS In an interview, Tango co-founder Eric Setton told Reuters that he believed his company, which offers games, multimedia sharing and other content, would eventually beat Whatsapp, which offers purely text and voice communications. ""The platform approach I believe is the winning strategy,"" Setton said. ""We've now seen it in a number of key markets, with Kakao in Korea or Line in Japan.""Tango, which has offices in Mountain View, California, Beijing and Austin, Texas, was introduced to Alibaba through Yang, who in 2005 led Yahoo's investment in the Chinese company.(Reporting by Gerry Shih; Editing by Leslie Adler)",2014-03-20,FB,"Thu Mar 20, 2014 | 12:03am EDT",Alibaba invests $280 million in messaging app Tango,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-tango-alibaba-group-investment-idUSBREA2J05B20140320?type=companyNews

144,"  (Corrects verb tense to ""met"" in second paragraph from ""meet"")By Alina Selyukh and Alexei OreskovicWASHINGTON/SAN FRANCISCO, March 21 Executives of several large U.S. Internet companies, including Facebook Inc  and Google Inc, met with President Barack Obama on Friday to discuss their concerns over government surveillance programs.Obama and senior aides met with six tech executives to discuss issues surrounding intelligence, technology and privacy, the White House said in a statement following the meeting. Executives were seen entering the White House around 4 p.m. EDT (2000 GMT) and leaving more than two hours later.Eric Schmidt, executive chairman of Google, the world's largest Internet search engine; Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive officer of Facebook, the world's biggest social network; and Reed Hastings, chief executive officer of Netflix Inc, an online video streaming service, were among those attending the meeting, the White House said.Other attendees are Aaron Levie and Drew Houston, chief executive officers of two online storage and file-sharing companies Box and Dropbox; and Alex Karp, chief executive officer of Palantir Technologies, a data-mining company which is partly backed by the CIA and whose clients include the National Security Agency.The president sought to provide reassurances that the administration is putting in place reforms to intelligence collection after revelations of widespread collection of data stirred outrage.""The president reiterated his administration's commitment to taking steps that can give people greater confidence that their rights are being protected while preserving important tools that keep us safe,"" the White House said.But Facebook's Zuckerberg, a public critic of government data gathering practices, said that more needed to be done. ""While the U.S. government has taken helpful steps to reform its surveillance practices, these are simply not enough,"" he said through a spokesperson.""People around the globe deserve to know that their information is secure and Facebook will keep urging the U.S. government to be more transparent about its practices and more protective of civil liberties,"" he said.Obama in January outlined a series of limited reforms to NSA data gathering, banning eavesdropping on the leaders of friendly or allied nations and proposing some changes to how NSA treats Americans' phone data.The most sweeping program, collection of telephone ""metadata,"" comes up for reauthorization next week, on March 28. Obama has asked Attorney General Eric Holder and the U.S. intelligence community to report back to him before that deadline on how to preserve the necessary capabilities of the program, without the government holding the metadata.""FRUSTRATION OVER THE DAMAGE"" An industry source said invitations to Friday's meeting with Obama were received on March 15, two days after Zuckerberg blasted U.S. electronic surveillance practices in a widely read public post on Facebook. ""I've called President Obama to express my frustration over the damage the government is creating for all of our future. Unfortunately, it seems like it will take a very long time for true full reform,"" Zuckerberg wrote.Some of the largest U.S. technology companies, including Google, its rival Yahoo Inc, social networking site Twitter Inc and others, have been pushing for more transparency, oversight and restrictions to U.S. government's gathering of intelligence.Facing criticism for their own collection practices involving users' data, the companies have also sought to clarify their relationships with U.S. law enforcement and spying agencies since June, when leaks to the news media by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden began to show the extent of U.S. spying capabilities.Media reports based on secret documents disclosed by Snowden have detailed how the U.S. government may have tapped into communications cables that link data centers owned by Google and Yahoo, and intercepted user data.The NSA has pushed back against the media reports that rely on Snowden leaks, calling many of them inaccurate and saying the spying programs are critical to U.S. national security.Snowden is wanted in the United States on espionage charges and is living in asylum in Russia.Friday's meeting is not the first on the matter for Obama and the tech industry leaders.

145,"  (Adds Facebook declined to comment, additional background)By Dan LevineSAN FRANCISCO, March 24 Facebook Inc has emerged as one of the biggest Silicon Valley companies to have resisted rivals' entreaties to stop poaching each other's employees, according to emails between the No. 1 social network and Google Inc released in court filings.Sheryl Sandberg had just been installed as Facebook's chief operating officer when one of her former colleagues from Google emailed her, according to the filings unsealed late last week. Facebook's aggressive recruitment of Google employees had heightened tensions between the two companies to ""Defcon 2,"" top Google executive Jonathan Rosenberg told Sandberg in August 2008.""Fix this problem. Propose that you will substantially lower the rate at which you hire people from us,"" Rosenberg told Sandberg in an email. ""Then make sure that happens.""But Sandberg deflected Rosenberg's entreaties, saying she thought Google only had limited no-solicitation agreements with companies with which it shared board members, not blanket no-hire policies with other companies.Plaintiffs say companies like Apple Inc, Google and Intel Corp drove down wages by agreeing to avoid soliciting employees from each other.""I declined at that time to limit Facebook's recruitment or hiring of Google employees,"" Sandberg wrote in a sworn declaration submitted by the plaintiffs in court. That response had made Facebook a witness, rather than a defendant, in a massive antitrust lawsuit brought by tech workers against the largest players in Silicon Valley.A Facebook representative declined to comment on Monday, while a Google spokesman could not immediately be reached.In past statements, Google said it has always ""actively and aggressively"" recruited top talent.Harry First, a professor at New York University School of Law who specializes in antitrust, said on Monday the exchange between Sandberg and Rosenberg at a minimum confirms how board relationships between the tech companies initially drove the agreements not to solicit from each other, which then expanded from there. ""That does not look good to the jury,"" First said.However, the defendants can also argue that the refusal of companies like Facebook to limit hiring shows that any alleged conspiracy could not have impacted the broader job market and wages in general.In 2010, Google, Apple, Adobe Systems Inc, Intel and others agreed to a settlement of a U.S. Justice Department probe that barred them from agreeing not to poach each other's employees. The companies have since been fighting the civil antitrust lawsuit. They argue the plaintiffs cannot successfully prove an overarching conspiracy to impact wages.Facebook is not the only Silicon Valley company which rejected a request to curtail its hiring efforts. In 2007, Apple co-founder Steve Jobs threatened to file a patent lawsuit against Palm if that company's chief executive didn't agree to refrain from poaching Apple employees, according to correspondence filed in court.However, then Palm CEO Edward Colligan told Jobs that the plan was ""likely illegal,"" and that Palm was not ""intimidated"" by the threat.""If you choose the litigation route, we can respond with our own claims based on patent assets, but I don't think litigation is the answer,"" Colligan said.Trial in the hiring class action is scheduled to begin in May.The civil case in U.S. District Court, Northern District of California is In Re: High-Tech Employee Antitrust Litigation, 11-cv-2509.(Editing by Bernadette Baum and Richard Chang)",2014-03-24,FB,"Mon Mar 24, 2014 | 4:23pm EDT",UPDATE 1-How Facebook avoided Google's fate in talent poaching lawsuit,http://www.reuters.com//article/facebook-google-lawsuit-idUSL1N0ML1CS20140324?type=companyNews

153,"   By Alexei Oreskovic | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Does Facebook Inc have Google envy?The social networking company's $2 billion acquisition of Oculus VR, a maker of virtual reality goggles, took Wall Street and technology observers by surprise, not least because of the hefty price for a company with no real revenue and untested technology.But Facebook's desire to bet on ""the platforms of tomorrow,"" as Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg described the deal on Tuesday, also marks a broadening of ambition for a company that has until now focused mainly on bolstering its existing service or defending its turf from immediate threats.It's a strategy more often associated with Facebook's arch-rival Google Inc, which has established a track record of making early bets on the next big thing. Google acquired the Android software that now powers three out of four smartphones in 2005 when PCs were dominant, and Google currently has projects under way involving self-driving cars and robots.""It's really the first acquisition of theirs which is really thinking about the future, versus the next wave of products or defensive,"" venture capitalist Jeff Clavier said of Facebook's deal for Oculus.""I don't know whether Oculus is as exciting as driverless cars or things like that in terms of impact. But at least it's a future technology that will definitively be mass market at some point,"" said Clavier, the founder and managing partner of Palo Alto-Calif-based SoftTech VC.Investors seemed unsure about Zuckerberg's crystal ball. Shares of Facebook were down more than 6 percent at $60.70 in late trading on Wednesday.The deal, which comes less than two months after Facebook announced plans to acquire Whatsapp for $19 billion in cash and stock, raised fears about the beginnings of an unchecked spending spree. ""I'd be surprised if a lot of people want to spend serious time with goggles that shut the world out entirely,"" said industry analyst Roger Kay, who wrote a post on the Forbes website on Wednesday that began ""Okay, I'll come right out and say it: Mark Zuckerberg is nuts.""CRYSTAL BALL-GAZING Detractors warn that Zuckerberg is spending shareholders' cash on a 2-year-old company that's first prototype was infamous for inducing motion sickness, though Oculus says it has largely ironed out the kinks. Though it has distributed some 75,000 development kits to interested developers, it has yet to ship an actual, consumer-ready product.Facebook will spend $400 million in cash on the deal, with the rest in stock. With Facebook's stock up 25 percent over the past six months, some said it was not surprising that the company was choosing to use its stock to place some bets on the future. As a percentage of Facebook's nearly $160 billion market value, the Oculus acquisition is not a ""bet the company"" deal, said Macquarie Research analyst Ben Schachter.The most surprising thing about the Oculus acquisition was that the buyer was Facebook, and not a hardware company like Apple Inc, said Schachter.""It's Facebook emphasizing a much broader ambition than people perhaps had realized,"" he said. Despite some of the market's skepticism, Schachter said he believed Oculus could be a good fit for Facebook's communications services.""People always underestimate the value of these things when they show they are going to be the winning platform,"" said Joe Lonsdale, a founding partner of venture capital firm Formation 8, which invested in Oculus.

154,"   By Alexei Oreskovic | SAN FRANCISCO, March 26  SAN FRANCISCO, March 26 Does Facebook Inc  have Google envy?The social networking company's $2 billion acquisition of Oculus VR, a maker of virtual reality goggles, took Wall Street and technology observers by surprise, not least because of the hefty price for a company with no real revenue and untested technology.But Facebook's desire to bet on ""the platforms of tomorrow,"" as Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg described the deal on Tuesday, also marks a broadening of ambition for a company that has until now focused mainly on bolstering its existing service or defending its turf from immediate threats.It's a strategy more often associated with Facebook's arch-rival Google Inc, which has established a track record of making early bets on the next big thing. Google acquired the Android software that now powers three out of four smartphones in 2005 when PCs were dominant, and Google currently has projects under way involving self-driving cars and robots.""It's really the first acquisition of theirs which is really thinking about the future, versus the next wave of products or defensive,"" venture capitalist Jeff Clavier said of Facebook's deal for Oculus.""I don't know whether Oculus is as exciting as driverless cars or things like that in terms of impact. But at least it's a future technology that will definitively be mass market at some point,"" said Clavier, the founder and managing partner of Palo Alto-Calif-based SoftTech VC.Investors seemed unsure about Zuckerberg's crystal ball. Shares of Facebook were down more than 6 percent at $60.70 in late trading on Wednesday.The deal, which comes less than two months after Facebook announced plans to acquire Whatsapp for $19 billion in cash and stock, raised fears about the beginnings of an unchecked spending spree. ""I'd be surprised if a lot of people want to spend serious time with goggles that shut the world out entirely,"" said industry analyst Roger Kay, who wrote a post on the Forbes website on Wednesday that began ""Okay, I'll come right out and say it: Mark Zuckerberg is nuts.""CRYSTAL BALL-GAZING Detractors warn that Zuckerberg is spending shareholders' cash on a 2-year-old company that's first prototype was infamous for inducing motion sickness, though Oculus says it has largely ironed out the kinks. Though it has distributed some 75,000 development kits to interested developers, it has yet to ship an actual, consumer-ready product. Facebook will spend $400 million in cash on the deal, with the rest in stock. With Facebook's stock up 25 percent over the past six months, some said it was not surprising that the company was choosing to use its stock to place some bets on the future.As a percentage of Facebook's nearly $160 billion market value, the Oculus acquisition is not a ""bet the company"" deal, said Macquarie Research analyst Ben Schachter.The most surprising thing about the Oculus acquisition was that the buyer was Facebook, and not a hardware company like Apple Inc, said Schachter.""It's Facebook emphasizing a much broader ambition than people perhaps had realized,"" he said. Despite some of the market's skepticism, Schachter said he believed Oculus could be a good fit for Facebook's communications services. ""People always underestimate the value of these things when they show they are going to be the winning platform,"" said Joe Lonsdale, a founding partner of venture capital firm Formation 8, which invested in Oculus.Until now, Facebook's biggest deals have focused on fortifying or defending its social networking service. Photo-sharing service Instagram and mobile messaging app WhatsApp both competed with key aspects of Facebook, threatening to siphon users away from Facebook's advertising-supported website.It recently stepped up its investments in artificial intelligence.

But they reversed course in the afternoon as technology stocks turned sharply lower.Facebook Inc shares were off more than 5 percent at $61.71, a day after the social media giant announced it will acquire two-year-old Oculus VR Inc, a maker of virtual-reality glasses for gaming, for $2 billion. A sharp decline in the stock of King Digital Entertainment Plc, maker of the wildly popular ""Candy Crush Saga"" game, also weighed on investor sentiment.The stock fell nearly 20 percent to $19.64 in its trading debut on Wednesday after the company's initial public offering valued it at about $6 billion. King was the most actively traded stock on the New York Stock Exchange.The technology sector seemed to be weighing on the market, contributing to the recent trend of the market opening positive but seesawing between gains and losses throughout the day, said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer at Solaris Asset Management in Bedford Hills, New York. ""(The tech sector) is causing a lot of volatility,"" he said.The CBOE Volatility index, a widely used gauge of investor sentiment on Wall Street, rose 3.9 percent to 14.57.

157,"   By Alexei Oreskovic and Malathi Nayak | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Facebook Inc will acquire two-year-old Oculus VR Inc, a maker of virtual-reality glasses for gaming, for $2 billion, buying its way into the fast-growing wearable devices arena with its first-ever hardware deal.The acquisition, which comes hot on the heels of its $19 billion deal for messaging service WhatsApp, marks a big bet by Facebook to anticipate the next shift in an evolving technology industry, at a time when consumers are increasingly abandoning their PCs for smartphones.The world's largest social network was deemed late to recognize the shift to mobile devices and the company's revenue has only recently begun to recover from the late start.Many in the industry believe that wearable devices could represent the next big platform shift. Google Inc has been testing Google Glass, a stamp-sized electronic screen mounted to a pair of eyeglasses for several years. Last week, it introduced an effort to develop computerized wristwatches.On Tuesday, Facebook said virtual-reality technology could emerge as the next social and communications platform.""The history of our industry is that every 10 or 15 years there's a new major computing platform, whether it's the PC, the Web or now mobile,"" Facebook co-founder and Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said in a conference call with analysts and media on Tuesday to discuss the acquisition.""We're making a long-term bet that immersive, virtual and augmented reality will become a part of people's daily life,"" the 29-year-old Zuckerberg said, noting that wearing the Oculus goggles was ""different than anything I've ever experienced in my life.""Zuckerberg said Facebook was not interested in becoming a hardware company and did not intend to try to make a profit from sales of the devices over the long term. Instead, he said Facebook's software and services would continue to serve as the company's underlying business, potentially generating revenue on Oculus devices through everything from advertising to sales of virtual goods.While Oculus will operate as an independent company, Zuckerberg stressed that Facebook's plans for Oculus extended well beyond games.""Imagine enjoying a court side seat at a game, studying in a classroom of students and teachers all over the world or consulting with a doctor face-to-face - just by putting on goggles in your home,"" he said.In addition to game makers, Oculus has garnered some interest from developers keen on creating apps in areas like architecture, automobiles, marketing and education, the company has said. Shares of Facebook, which have risen 25 percent in the past six months, were down nearly 1 percent at $64.36 in late trading on Tuesday.Facebook's recent spate of acquisitions is somewhat concerning, RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney wrote in a note to investors on Tuesday. But he said that for a company of Facebook's size, the deal did not seem ""irrational.""""The question this time is whether Facebook is too early or simply betting on the wrong platform. This won't be known for some time. But if it gets the platform right, we're relatively confident that Facebook will develop an effective monetization strategy for it, thus boosting its overall financial growth,"" Mahaney said.HAPPY, GO LUCKEY The acquisition makes Oculus VR one of the most successful companies or projects to ever emerge from the fledgling Kickstarter program, which has helped attract small investments from the public for everything from the Pebble smartwatch to the recent ""Veronica Mars"" movie. Oculus VR, founded by Palmer Luckey, a self-described virtual-reality enthusiast and hardware geek, got its start as a Kickstarter-funded program, drawing small investments from thousands of people on the popular fund-raising platform.It quickly drew attention to its ""Oculus Rift"" virtual-reality glasses, demoed at tech and gaming conventions around the country.Oculus VR raised $75 million in December in a round led by Andreessen Horowitz, to market its virtual-reality headset for video games and develop the product for use in areas like education, film, architecture and design. Andreessen Horowitz partner Marc Andreessen, who is also on Facebook's board, said in a tweet on Tuesday that he was recused ""on both sides"" of the Facebook Oculus deal.Other venture capital backers included Spark Capital, Formation 8 and Matrix Partners. Oculus now employs more than 100 people and has distributed some 75,000 software development kits for Oculus Rift to game developers and others.It recently began taking orders for new software development kits with better graphics and features to reduce motion sickness - a frequent complaint of the old prototype - slated to ship in July for $350 apiece.Oculus plans to produce commercial versions of its virtual-reality glasses, called Oculus Rift, which users mount on their heads with a strap. It also hopes to take its technology beyond gaming. ""Virtual reality creates a canvas that is much richer than anything we've seen in computing so far,"" Antonio Rodriguez, Oculus board member and general partner at Matrix Partners said in an interview with Reuters on Tuesday.He said virtual reality presents an opportunity to re-imagine various tasks and social interactions in areas like medicine and education.So far, ""people have done all sort of apps (outside gaming) like body switching apps, where two bodies are scanned and you can switch identities.Last week, Sony unveiled a prototype for a new virtual-reality headset accessory for its Playstation 4 games console at the annual Game Developers Conference in San Francisco. The headset, still in development under the name ""Project Morpheus"", is designed to provide an immersive experience for gamers and is poised to compete with Oculus' Rift once both devices are on the market.DEAL SPREE The deal, which Facebook said is expected to close in the second quarter, marks the company's second multi-billion dollar acquisition since mid-February.Zuckerberg said on the call the two deals involved ""incredibly rare companies"" and that Facebook was unlikely to continue making big acquisitions at a similar pace.Facebook ended 2013 with $11.45 billion in cash and marketable securities. The company's $19 billion acquisition of WhatsApp includes $4 billion in cash. The Oculus deal comprises $400 million in cash and 23.1 million shares of Facebook common stock.Finance Chief David Ebersman said the price of the deal was based primarily on the gaming business, but that Facebook believed the technology could be worth ""multiples"" of the purchase price if Facebook succeeds in extending it into other areas such as entertainment and communications.(Additional reporting by Lehar Maan in Bangalore, writing by Edwin Chan; Editing by Don Sebastian, Andrew Hay and Ryan Woo)",2014-03-26,FB,"Wed Mar 26, 2014 | 1:20pm EDT",Facebook to buy virtual reality goggles maker for $2 billion,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-facebook-acquisition-idUSBREA2O1WX20140326?type=companyNews

163,"  SAN FRANCISCO, March 27 Andreessen Horowitz, a venture capital firm that has backed Facebook and Twitter, raised $1.5 billion for a its fourth fund, the firm said in a blog post.The firm will continue to invest largely in technology businesses, said chief operating officer Scott Kupor in a blog post, based on the thesis that technology markets will grow enormously thanks to developments such as mobile Internet penetration, cloud computing and falling costs.Sometimes criticized by other venture firms for its techniques such as outsized bets on companies and a heavy emphasis on marketing, Andreessen acknowledged the venture business was going through a difficult time. Specifically, limited partners, those who invest in venture funds, are allocating much less cash to the sector than they were 15 years ago, and fewer venture firms exist. ""While such transitions can indeed be painful, this is a positive sign of a professionalizing market - one in which the supply and the demand are in closer equilibrium,"" Kupor wrote. Andreessen, which has backed companies such as Facebook,  is part of an elite group of funds which experience little trouble raising more cash. Earlier this month, Accel Partners raised two funds totaling $1.48 billion.

164,"  PARIS, March 27 European stocks were set to dip on Thursday, halting their recovery rally and mirroring losses on Wall Street, where technology stocks such as Facebook and King Digital Entertainment Plc  sank.     At 0725 GMT, futures for Euro STOXX 50, for UK's FTSE 100, for Germany's DAX and for France's CAC were down by between 0.1-0.3 percent.     Among U.S. technology shares taking a hit on Wednesday, Facebook tumbled 6.9 percent after the social networking company said it would acquire two-year-old Oculus VR Inc, a maker of virtual-reality glasses for gaming, for $2 billion.     A sharp drop in the shares of King Digital Entertainment Plc, the maker of the popular ""Candy Crush Saga"" game, also dampened investor enthusiasm for tech IPOs. King's stock sank 15.6 percent in its trading debut after the initial public offering valued the company at about $6 billion.      ""Concerns that the tech sector has pumped itself up into a bubble again were highlighted by the disastrous debut of King Digital,"" Capital Spreads trader Jonathan Sudaria wrote in a note.     The sharp drop in King Digital's shares, which highlighted investors' concerns that the sector has been overpriced, hurt shares in Chinese internet and software companies on Thursday, with Tencent Holdings Ltd, China's biggest listed internet firm with a profitable mobile gaming business, falling 5.6 percent.      Simmering tensions between the West and Russia also weighed on investor sentiment. The United States and the European Union agreed on Wednesday to work together to prepare potential tougher economic sanctions in response to Russia's intervention in Ukraine, including on the energy sector.

Santa Clara, California-based Arista listed Morgan Stanley and Citigroup as lead underwriters to the offering in its IPO filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday.The company, whose competitors include Cisco Systems Inc , said it would raise $200 million from the offering, but the final size of the IPO could be different. The company, led by former Cisco executive Jayashree Ullal, builds switches that handle traffic at large internet data centers for companies including Facebook Inc, Yahoo Inc , Comcast Corp and Citigroup Inc.Ullal has been CEO since October 2008 and is also Arista's largest individual shareholder, according to the IPO filing.Cloud technology distributes large amounts of data and applications across multiple servers, allowing companies to cut costs by outsourcing data management and computing needs. Reuters reported in November that Arista had selected banks for a possible IPO. Industry analysts have estimated that the company could be valued at about $2.5 billion.Arista said it would list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ""ANET"". It did not reveal how many shares it planned to sell or their expected price.The company was started in 2004 by Andy Bechtolsheim and David Cheriton, a computer science professor at Stanford University, with $100 million in funding.The amount of money a company says it plans to raise in its first IPO filing is used to calculate registration fees. The final size of the IPO could be different.

169,"  (Adds Amazon comment)By Alexei OreskovicSAN FRANCISCO, April 2 Apple Inc, Google Inc and Facebook Inc have made significant progress in adopting renewable energy sources to power their Web services, the environmental group Greenpeace said in a report on Wednesday.But energy-hungry data centers operated by some of the Internet industry's top companies remain overly reliant on carbon-emitting coal and gas, the report said.Apple Inc, which built an on-site solar panel farm and fuel-cells at its North Carolina data center and has procured renewable energy directly at its other three facilities, earned the highest marks on the ""scorecard"" of Internet company data centers that Greenpeace issues every two years.Greenpeace rated Apple's efforts in transparency, renewable energy policy and renewable energy deployment with an A grade in each category, compared with a mix of D and F grades two years ago when the group released its last report.At the other end of the spectrum, Amazon.com Inc's  Web Services business, which Greenpeace said operates at least 18 data centers around the world, was singled out for being among the least committed to renewable energy, earning F grades in three out of Greenpeace's four categories. Some Internet companies ""have refused to pay even lip service to sustainability and are simply buying dirty energy straight from the grid,"" said the report. ""Those companies, most notably Amazon Web Services, are choosing how to power their infrastructure based solely on lowest electricity prices.""Amazon disputed Greenpeace's assessment of its data center operation, saying that the report's data and assumptions were inaccurate. Amazon said in an emailed statement that data centers in two regions in which it operates use ""100 percent carbon-free power"" without elaborating.Data centers, multibillion-dollar facilities stuffed with racks of tightly-packed computers, are the heart of the fast-growing Internet industry. The facilities store consumers' email and other personal data, and help deliver popular online offerings such as Netflix's streaming video service and Facebook's photo-laden social network. A large Internet data center requires energy capacity of as much as 80 megwatts, which would be enough to power about 65,000 U.S. homes, according to Greenpeace spokesman David Pomerantz.The increasing prevalence of Internet services means growing demand for electricity in the coming years, Greenpeace said.Six major Internet services companies - Facebook, Apple, Google, Box, Rackspace and Salesforce.com - have committed to making their data center operations 100 percent based on renewable energy, according to the report. Those commitments are putting pressure on utilities to offer wind, solar and other forms of renewable power, Greenpeace said. The report looked at 19 companies that operate more than 300 data centers combined. Greenpeace used information provided by the companies and utilities to estimate what portion of a company's Internet infrastructure is going to be based on renewable energy, which it refers to as a ""Clean Energy Index.""Renewable energy credits, which a company can purchase to meet clean energy goals, were not counted.Apple's Clean Energy Index was 100 percent, while Facebook and Google were rated by Greenpeace at 49 percent and 48 percent, respectively.Google has been a leader in committing to renewable energy, with procurement deals to purchase wind power from utilities in several states, Greenpeace said. But with 13 data centers, compared with Apple's four, the company faces a bigger task in shifting its overall energy usage to renewable sources.Amazon Web Services, which Greenpeace said operates more than 10 data centers in the Virginia area, had a Clean Energy Index of 15 percent, according to Greenpeace.

In the latest week, U.S. jobless claims rose more than expected, the Labor Department said on Thursday, but the underlying trend still pointed to some strength in the job market.

The S&P 500 rose as high as 1,893.80. Some analysts said the selloff in ""momentum"" stocks has yet to run its course, though this could benefit more value-oriented names. Buyers scooped up some of those companies' shares, which helped to limit the Dow's decline. Intel Corp gained 2.1 percent to $26.43. American Express Co added 0.5 percent to $90.87.Among momentum stocks, the shares of Tesla Motors, the electric car maker, fell 2.4 percent to $224.90 and the shares of Netflix Inc, the online movie rental company, lost 2.6 percent to stand at $353.49.The options market also focused on momentum stocks, with Tesla Motors remaining a favorite with the speculative crowd for a second day. The total option volume by afternoon was running at about a 30 percent mark-up to what's typically seen. Shares of Barnes & Noble Inc plunged 14.7 percent to $18.87 after Liberty Media Corp said it has sold almost all of its stake in the company, ending a nearly three-year bet that the struggling retailer would emerge as a dominant seller of e-books.The S&P 500 now consists of 501 stocks, with the index including both Google Inc's Class A and Class C  shares after the company's special dividend. Google's Class A shares rose 0.5 percent to $570.88 while its Class C shares gained 0.4 percent to $569.18.On the economic front, the U.S. trade deficit unexpectedly widened in February to $42.3 billion as exports hit a five-month low, suggesting that first-quarter growth could be much weaker than initially expected.A bright spot came from the services sector, where growth accelerated in March after being hampered by unusually cold weather, according to the Institute for Supply Management's services-sector index.In the biopharmaceutical sector, Gilead Sciences Inc  said late Wednesday that a trial of its hepatitis C drug sofosbuvir, sold under the brand name Sovaldi in the United States, showed the drug was safe and effective in treating Japanese patients infected with a common form of the virus. However, its stock slipped 0.7 percent to $73.44.Vivus Inc shares tumbled 7.3 percent to $5.73 after Piper Jaffray cut its rating on the pharmaceutical company's stock to ""underweight"" from ""neutral.""

174,"  (Corrects story to show vote took place in Brussels, not Strasbourg)BRUSSELS, April 3 The European Parliament voted overwhelmingly in favour of ending mobile phone roaming fees on Thursday, a move that will cheer Europe's consumers even as it frustrates telecoms companies.In a sitting of the parliament in Brussels, lawmakers backed legislation that will phase out roaming fees across the 28-country European Union by December 2015.""This vote is the EU delivering for citizens,"" said Neelie Kroes, the European commissioner for digital affairs and an ardent advocate for ending the charges.""This is what the EU is all about - getting rid of barriers to make life easier and less expensive. We should know what we are buying, we should not be ripped-off, and we should have the opportunity to change our mind.""At the same time, the parliament voted in favour of maintaining ""net neutrality"", effectively declaring that all traffic on the Internet should be treated equally, regardless of the source or the content. The decision is a move to limit the ability of network operators to provide quicker Internet access to content providers in exchange for a fee and is another decision in favour of consumers.Both steps are part of Kroes's plans to overhaul Europe's telecoms sector and try to make it more competitive with rivals in the United States and Asia. But they also come just two months before EU elections, when more than 300 million Europeans will vote for candidates to the European Parliament.Putting an end to mobile roaming - and the phone-bill shock that affects those who use their phones abroad - has been a banner issue for legislators over the past three years, leading to tense exchanges with the powerful telecoms industry. Sector analysts estimate telecoms revenues could fall around five percent without roaming fees, although the Commission argues that since more consumers will use their mobiles as a result, some of the impact will be offset.European lawmakers also set restrictions on the kind of online services that telecoms operators can charge popular, bandwidth-hungry content providers such as Facebook, Google and Netflix in exchange for delivering their services at faster speeds.Operators are fighting for a share of the profits from video streaming and music downloads to offset declining revenues in their traditional phone services. Sales are forecast to fall for the fifth consecutive year in 2014. The industry says charging for different services and speeds would would help fund network upgrades. But Internet activists say that goes against the spirit of an open Internet and would lead to the creation of a two-speed system.The European Parliament's vote on Thursday effectively sides with consumers and Internet activists, backing ""net neutrality"".Lobbying group ETNO, whose members include Deutsche Telekom , Orange, Telefonica and Telecoms Italia, said the parliamentary vote was a step in the wrong direction.""Today's vote risks derailing the original objectives of the Connected Continent Regulation, namely a strong European digital industry igniting growth and jobs creation,"" ETNO head Luigi Gambardella said.Following parliament's backing, the measures will become law after they are approved by the European Council, which represents the EU's member states. After further discussions, the Council is expected to take a decision in October.

177,"   By Angela Moon | NEW YORK, April 4  NEW YORK, April 4 After their worst week in several years, high-flying stocks that defied gravity throughout 2013 look like they're in for more punishment. The reason: Despite the plunge, they still look overvalued.Familiar names such as Netflix, Facebook and Tesla Motors, along with a number of biotechnology and cloud-computing stocks, have been pummeled in the last month. Some stocks are down more than 20 percent over that period, falling into their own bear market, and yet their valuations still far exceed those of the broader U.S. stock indexes. Wall Street defines a bear market as a drop of 20 percent or more from a recent peak.Facebook Inc, for example, has fallen nearly 22 percent from an intraday record reached less than a month ago. The stock was still up nearly 3.8 percent for the year at Friday's close. Among biotech names, Alexion Pharmaceuticals  has declined 23 percent from a Feb. 25 intraday high, and yet the stock on Friday was still up 7 percent for the year.Facebook still traded on Friday at a price-to-sales ratio of nearly 20, making it the most expensive in the S&P 500, which has an overall price-to-sales ratio of 1.7. The other companies with expensive valuations read like a Who's Who of so-called momentum stocks, including Regeneron, Alexion, TripAdvisor and Vertex Pharmaceuticals.""There's value somewhere, but since these things aren't being traded off typical valuations, you can't go by those metrics, and it's more about when do you find that stability,"" said Mike O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Stamford, Connecticut.The price-to-sales ratio is the way to value a stock by looking at its market capitalization in comparison to its sales over a 12-month period.The declines have come at a time when investors overall are seeing a general improvement in economic figures, including Friday's nonfarm payrolls data, which showed strong job gains in March and more people moving into the labor force.On Friday, the Nasdaq lost more than 100 points even though the S&P 500 briefly touched another intraday record.TEPID EARNINGS FORECAST  Expectations for earnings have come down for the first quarter, but investors are hoping for an improved outlook for most of the S&P 500. That may cause the rotation away from hyper-growth to steady growth to continue.Earnings season begins next week with reports from Bed Bath & Beyond, Wells Fargo & Co and JPMorgan Chase & Co.First-quarter S&P 500 companies' earnings are projected to have increased just 1.2 percent from a year ago, Thomson Reuters data showed. The forecast is down sharply from the start of the year, when growth was estimated at 6.5 percent.""I'm not concerned about this spilling over to the broader market. We've been in a trading range, finding resistance at record levels, so this isn't cause for alarm,"" said David Joy, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial in Boston, where he helps oversee $703 billion in assets under management.""I think there are bargains to be found, just not in the names that are getting hit. Financials are attractive here, as are industrials. The more mature tech names, especially on the software side, look valuable,"" he said. The interest in speculative plays hasn't entirely eroded. Four different companies made their debuts on U.S. exchanges on Friday, and all four ended their first day higher, with the most notable being online food delivery service GrubHub Inc, which shot up 31 percent.However, for those concerned that the selling in biotech, Internet retail and other trading-crowd favorites will spill over to the rest of the market, Friday was a bit worrisome. The S&P 500 gave up early gains to end the day down 1.25 percent.""If the weakness here cascades into other sectors, that would indicate a fundamental shift in the market. If things keep rolling over, you might want to seek protection or examine your fundamentals,"" said Michael Matousek, head trader at U.S. Global Investors Inc in San Antonio, which manages about $1.3 billion.OVERSUPPLY  Since stocks like Netflix carry valuations far above most of the market, some investors are reluctant to buy them now.""For momentum stocks to work, you need people to believe they can go higher,"" said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh.O'Rourke pointed out that while many of these stocks are actually still up for 2014 on an absolute basis, buyers this year are underwater, based on the shares' volume-weighted average price (VWAP).The VWAP is a measure of the average cost of a stock for a particular period.Facebook, for instance, had gained 9 percent in 2014 as of Thursday's close. Going into Friday, investors who bought the stock this year were on average down 6 percent on a VWAP basis.""They bought at the wrong time, based upon where the shares are now,"" he said. ""This also means there is a high likelihood there will be overhead supply when the shares rally as investors seek to unwind the losing trades.""In the options market, investors used the opportunity to exercise some caution. Amazon.com attracted trading volume at more than two-and-a-half-times the recent daily average volume. The most active option contracts were put options expiring next week that protect against the stock falling below $320, suggesting some hedging against losses.Options trading volume for TripAdvisor surged to nearly three times the recent average. Put options outpaced calls, with 8,841 calls and 9,832 puts traded on Friday.(Wall St Week Ahead runs every Friday.

178,"   By Maria Kiselyova | MOSCOW  MOSCOW A dispute between shareholders in Russia's biggest social network escalated on Monday, as the rivals took legal action to assert their influence over a business that has been used as a platform for opposition groups.Known as Russia's answer to Facebook, VKontakte has been the focus of an ownership battle since last April when the United Capital Partners (UCP) fund bought 48 percent of the shares, becoming its then biggest shareholder.Rival Mail.Ru, which has in the meantime joined forces with VK founder and chief executive Pavel Durov to become the biggest investor, contested the UCP transaction in a lawsuit filed by a subsidiary.Durov has clashed with authorities for providing a forum for opposition activists to organize protests against Vladimir Putin, including in 2011 when tens of thousands came out on to the streets in the biggest challenge yet to the Russian leader.But Mail.Ru is controlled by a Putin ally, Russia'a richest man Alisher Usmanov, prompting liberal commentators to portray the alliance between it and Durov as part of a wider Kremlin clampdown on dissent.Durov and Mail.Ru say they had pre-emptive rights to the stake that UCP bought from VK co-founders last year.The deal was followed by months of friction between UCP and Durov that seemingly culminated last week in Durov's resignation which he later revoked, saying his departure would have threatened the company's future. ""I have repeatedly said it and will repeat it today, the sale of 48 percent of shares was illegal, and UCP is not a legitimate shareholder of VKontakte,"" Durov said on Monday on his vk.com page.LONGER-TERM IMPACT? VK, the second largest social media network in Europe after Facebook, has 240 million separate user accounts and attracts around 60 million users daily who log on to share news, views and photos.Durov, whose success in building VK has drawn comparisons to Facebook's founder Mark Zuckerberg, sold his 12 percent VK stake in January to Bullion Development Limited, a company beneficially owned by Usmanov's ally Ivan Tavrin, the CEO of mobile operator Megafon. Tavrin later sold Bullion to Mail.Ru, which now owns 52 percent of VK shares.Konstantin Belov, an analyst at Uralsib, said the dispute would likely have a limited impact on Mail.Ru shares but could hamper the long-term development of the social networking site.""Taking into account that the Internet market and social media in particular are changing very fast, could it be that VK will miss some of the changes on the market because of this mess?"" he said.In a statement on Monday, Mail.Ru's Bullion said it had filed a lawsuit against two VK shareholders in turn owned by UCP and its managing partner Ilya Sherbovich - Blesmir Developments Limited and Palagon Limited. Bullion alleges that the sale of these firms to UCP was in breach of the VK shareholder agreement, including a requirement to offer shares in VK to the other shareholders first, and is seeking to reverse the deal.A spokesman for Bullion declined to name the court or say in which jurisdiction the lawsuit had been filed.UCP said its deal was legitimate.""This is nothing more than an awkward attempt by Durov to defend himself against our legitimate claims against him,"" said UCP partner Yuri Kachuro in an email.UCP said earlier on Monday it had begun legal action against Durov and Mail.Ru over the launch of the Telegram instant messaging application, developed by Durov.UCP said Durov had ""improperly diverted to himself corporate opportunities which he was duty bound to pursue, if at all, within the business of VK.Com"" and that VK was ""the proper owner"" of the Telegram business, the fund said in a statement.(Reporting by Maria Kiselyova and Anastasia Teterevleva; Editing by Elizabeth Piper and John Stonestreet)",2014-04-07,FB,"Mon Apr 7, 2014 | 10:46am EDT",Lawsuits deepen shareholder row over 'Russia's Facebook',http://www.reuters.com//article/us-russia-vkontakte-idUSBREA3614120140407?type=companyNews

""Taking into account that the Internet market and social media in particular are changing very fast, could it be that VK will miss some of the changes on the market because of this mess?"" he said.In a statement on Monday, Mail.Ru's Bullion said it had filed a lawsuit against two VK shareholders in turn owned by UCP and its managing partner Ilya Sherbovich - Blesmir Developments Limited and Palagon Limited.Bullion alleges that the sale of these firms to UCP was in breach of the VK shareholder agreement, including a requirement to offer shares in VK to the other shareholders first, and is seeking to reverse the deal.A spokesman for Bullion declined to name the court or say in which jurisdiction the lawsuit had been filed.UCP said its deal was legitimate.""This is nothing more than an awkward attempt by Durov to defend himself against our legitimate claims against him,"" said UCP partner Yuri Kachuro in an email.UCP said earlier on Monday it had begun legal action against Durov and Mail.Ru over the launch of the Telegram instant messaging application, developed by Durov.UCP said Durov had ""improperly diverted to himself corporate opportunities which he was duty bound to pursue, if at all, within the business of VK.Com"" and that VK was ""the proper owner"" of the Telegram business, the fund said in a statement.

180,"  (Repeats from Friday April 4 without change)By Alexei OreskovicSAN FRANCISCO, April 7 The personal data gathering abilities of Google, Facebook and other tech companies has sparked growing unease among Americans, with a majority worried that Internet companies are encroaching too much upon their lives, a new poll showed.Google and Facebook generally topped lists of Americans'  concerns about the ability to track physical locations and monitor spending habits and personal communications, according to a poll conducted by Reuters/Ipsos from March 11 to March 26.The survey highlights a growing ambivalence towards Internet companies whose popular online services, such as social networking, e-commerce and search, have blossomed into some of the world's largest businesses.Now, as the boundaries between Web products and real world services begin to blur, many of the top Internet companies are racing to put their stamp on everything from home appliances to drones and automobiles.With billions of dollars in cash, high stock prices, and an appetite for more user data, Google, Facebook, Amazon  and others are acquiring a diverse set of companies and launching ambitious technology projects.But their grand ambitions are inciting concern, according to the poll of nearly 5,000 Americans. Of 4,781 respondents, 51 percent replied ""yes"" when asked if those three companies, plus Apple, Microsoft and Twitter, were pushing too far and expanding into too many areas of people's lives.This poll measures accuracy using a credibility interval and is accurate to plus or minus 1.6 percentage points.""It's very accurate to say that many people have love-hate relationships with some of their technology providers,"" said Nuala O'Connor, the President of the Center for Democracy and Technology, an Internet public policy group which has received funding from companies including Google, Amazon and Microsoft.""As technology moves forward, as new technologies are in use and in people's lives, they should question 'Is this a fair deal between me and the device?'"" Fears about the expanding abilities of tech companies crystallized when Google acknowledged in 2010 that its fleet of StreetView cars, which criss-cross the globe taking panoramic photos for Google's online mapping service, had inadvertently collected emails and other personal information transmitted over unencrypted home wireless networks.Yet many Americans remain ignorant of the extent to which Internet companies are trying to extend their reach.Google is one of the most aggressively ambitious, investing in the connected home through its $3.2 billion acquisition of smart thermostat maker Nest. Google is also investing in self-driving cars, augmented-reality glasses, robots and drones.Almost a third of Americans say they know nothing about plans by Google and its rivals to get into real-world products such as phones, cars and appliances. Still, roughly two thirds of respondents are already worried about what Internet companies will do with the personal information they collect, or how securely they store the data. ""We're getting to a point in society where basically everything's going to be tracked,"" said Richard Armitage, a 46-year-old budget analyst in Colorado who participated in the survey. ""They have access to so much data that they could use inappropriately in my opinion.""Google, Apple, Microsoft and Facebook had no immediate comment. Amazon and Twitter did not respond to requests for comment.But all have said protecting customers' privacy is a top priority, or published strict policies restricting the use of personal data if needed. For instance, storing select data can make online searches and services more reliable.EMBRACING THE REAL WORLD  Public sensitivity about privacy was heightened by revelations of U.S. surveillance activities by the National Security Agency, as leaked by former spy contractor Edward Snowden, said Ryan Calo, a law professor at the University of Washington who recently wrote a paper about the legal and social implications of robotics.Those concerns will become even more pressing as Internet companies expand the scope of their activities, said Marc Rotenberg, director of EPIC, a privacy advocacy group.""The links between the online world and the offline world are growing tighter,"" he said. ""It's no longer unplugging your laptop and walking away and rejoining the physical world, because the online world is now following you,"" he said, citing examples like Google's acquisition of home appliance maker Nest.Google has said it will not combine user data from Nest products with the data it collects about it users of its other online services, but some privacy advocates remain concerned.New wearable devices, like fitness bracelets and smartwatches that monitor heart rates and other biological information, will increasingly allow companies to collect biological data, said Jonathan Zittrain, the director of Harvard University's Berkman Center for Internet & Society.""The whole can become more than a sum of parts,"" when it comes to personal information, said Zittrain. ""Little bits of innocuous data...can add up to very revealing, and sometimes intensely private, insights,"" about people, he said.As Internet companies expand their scope of activities, they may not be able to count on the same level of public goodwill they enjoyed as smaller companies. Twenty-seven percent of the survey respondents said they did not think Google adhered to the ""Don't Be Evil"" slogan that has long been its unofficial motto.Of the respondents to the survey, 42 percent said they had negative feelings about Internet companies developing drones which both Amazon and Facebook have said they are investigating, while 29 percent felt negatively about robots, which Google thrust to the forefront with its acquisition of Boston Dynamics.Only 13 percent of respondents indicated negative feelings about Internet companies offering home appliances however.""It happens to be that there's a constellation of technologies that are next, that are new, that are transforming, and they are unsettling,"" Calo said.

181,"   By David Gaffen and Rodrigo Campos  The last six weeks have been rough for investors who jumped into 2013's big stock market winners like Netflix and Facebook, only to see their share prices crater.For now, they have shifted money to other parts of the equities market, instead of retreating to safe-havens like cash, and concerns that there will be a full-scale retreat are muted. Despite the ugliness in sectors like biotech, down 20 percent from its high, the broad S&P 500 has lost just 3.2 percent.And the flashing lights that often exist around the time of a deeper reversal just aren't there.""This sell-off is giving me the chance to buy at lower prices,"" said Josh Spencer, portfolio manager of the T.Rowe Price Global Technology Fund (PRGTX.O). ""If you pick your spots well, you can play defense and offense at the same time, if you buy good companies that have corrected in price.""His confidence may be justified.Reuters examined 10 different market metrics, and found that eight are supportive or at least benign when it comes to buying equities.For starters, the initial public offering market looks remarkably healthy, which rarely happens when stocks are going out of favor. This week alone there are plans for 15 market debuts, according to Briefing.com.Last week wasn't too bad either - in a week in which some major Internet stocks were taking a battering, online restaurant ordering service GrubHub (GRUB.N) was a big hit and its shares are now up 36 percent from its $26 IPO price.IPO proceeds so far this year come to $14.1 billion, not far from the $15.4 billion in proceeds at this time for 2012 and 2013 combined, according to Thomson Reuters data.Deal making is also buoyant. This year, U.S. mergers and acquisitions have totaled $390 billion, the most since the same period in 2007. ""You're not seeing deals pulled because of 'market conditions',"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities in New York.HEDGE FUNDS FAR FROM FLEEING Hedge funds are often a big part of market swings. So far, long/short equity hedge funds are not moving to cash, instead maintaining their gross exposure to equities.""Gross exposure hasn't shifted very much,"" said Jon Kinderlerer, head of risk advisory for prime services at Credit Suisse. ""There hasn't been signs of a big liquidation,"" though he did note a big pullback from technology stocks based on cloud computing.To be sure, there has been an increase in hedge funds taking on protection against a big drop. Headed into April, between 16 and 17 percent of funds had some kind of ""deep downside protection,"" according to Credit Suisse, about average for the last couple of years. As of Tuesday, that figure was around 18 to 19 percent of hedge funds. That's a modest shift, but higher than most readings in those years, suggesting increased concern among hedge fund managers.Among individuals, the weekly survey of the American Association of Individual Investors showed that last week, 35.4 percent of those surveyed were positive, an increase from the previous week, but still less than the historic average of 39 percent, according to AAII. Individual investor sentiment is sometimes seen as a contrarian indicator, with high levels of bullishness seen as a signal that a correction could be imminent. But in this case the survey appears to be largely in neutral.The CBOE Volatility index .VIX, an indication of how much investors are willing to pay up for protection against a slide in the S&P 500, remains subdued. At around 15, it is below the 20 historical median. It has closed above 20 just once this year and only a handful times more in the past two years.Market technicals are still supportive, if not for gains, at least in limiting any losses. The 1,840 level on the S&P 500 looms large (the S&P ended Tuesday at 1851.96), because it represents the 50-day moving average, a measure of the intermediate-term trend in the market. It also stands as what's known as a retracement level between the early February low and last week's high.When different technical indicators converge, it makes that level more important, where clusters of buyers would be expected to show up. Should the S&P fall through 1,840, it could presage a more significant selloff. SHORT BETS Exchange data show short interest has increased since the start of the year on an aggregate basis, but short bets in high-flying shares have receded.TripAdvisor (TRIP.O), down 21 percent since early March, has seen the number of its shares borrowed for short bets decline 18 percent since the year started, according to SunGard's Astec Analytics data. Borrowing in Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN.O) stock, also down 21 percent from its peak, has fallen by almost half. Bets against Facebook and Netflix have also declined in recent weeks.""This would suggest short sellers are both getting out of those stocks, closing their positions, and also refraining from opening up new positions. They would seem not to expect profit opportunity on the downside,"" said Karl Loomes, market analyst at Astec Analytics in London.Corporate results in the next few weeks will be crucial. Profit projections have continued to drop for first quarter results, and are now at a lowly 1.1 percent. That is largely as a result of the long, hard winter's damage to consumer and corporate demand.Earnings forecasts for the second quarter, though, have been relatively stable. Expectations are for growth of 8.3 percent in the second quarter, down from 9.7 percent forecast for the period at the beginning of the year, according to Thomson Reuters. The market's direction may be determined by whether the winter weakness gives way to a spring takeoff in demand.""If you start to see some shortfall on earnings and guidance to the downside then this (selloff) could actually continue,"" said Gordon Charlop, managing director at Rosenblatt Securities in New York.Still, economists at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch forecast the U.S. economy will grow at a healthy 3 and 3.5 percent in the next three quarters. And recent data, including car sales and housing market activity paint a better outlook for the U.S. economy.(Reporting by Rodrigo Campos, David Gaffen, Ryan Vlastelica, Ross Kerber, Timothy McLaughlin; Editing by Martin Howell)",2014-04-08,FB,"Tue Apr 8, 2014 | 6:26pm EDT","U.S. stock market may have stumbled, but signals still say 'go'",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-usa-selloff-outlook-analysis-idUSBREA3727V20140408?type=companyNews

192,"  (Adds more background including references to Google, Facebook)* At least four satellites to be launched in 2014* Terrestrial fibre networks growing slowly* New services to drive demandBy Helen Nyambura-MwauraJOHANNESBURG, April 17 Africa's demand for bandwidth is doubling every year, outpacing the laying of terrestrial telecom fibre links and encouraging commercial satellite operators to launch more units into orbit.The arrival of submarine cables on Africa's eastern shore just five years ago was largely expected to herald the end of satellite connections, which had been the region's only link to the outside world for decades.But the opposite is happening with Africa's political geography - notably its many landlocked countries, such as Zambia, South Sudan and Rwanda - bringing undersea cable plans back to earth.""If you are to provide connectivity to the masses, fibre is not the way to do it. Do you think that it would make economical sense to take fibre to every village in Kenya?"" said Ibrahima Guimba-Saidou, a senior executive for Africa at Luxembourg-based satellite operator SES SA .""Satellite is still around and will continue to be around because it's the best medium to extend connectivity to the masses.""Hundreds of millions of people on the continent still have no access to the Internet, he said.At least four satellites are planned for launch this year as countries with no access to the coast have yet to benefit from at least 10 undersea cables now serving the continent.""There will be times when they compete, but such is the growth in demand for bandwidth that there is room for plenty of players,"" said Mark Newman, chief research officer at industry research company Informa Telecoms & Media. ""If you are in a landlocked country, it might well be that even though satellite would seem to be expensive compared to the cost of fibre capacity that lands on the coast somewhere, by the time you get that capacity inland, it's no cheaper than satellite,"" Newman said.SES, one of the world's largest commercial satellite operators, expects to launch its Astra2G satellite in 2014 after sending three others dedicated to Africa into orbit in the last year. Nine of its 56 satellites orbiting the earth are allocated for Africa.Europe's biggest satellite operator Eutelsat plans to fire off its tri-band EUTELSAT 3B this month after launching another to extend sub-Saharan Africa coverage in 2013.[Graphic: Operational satellites: link.reuters.com/bex58v (Best viewed on external browser such as Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox)] MOBILES DRIVE DEMAND Competition to provide Internet access in Africa is to intensify further as the continent's rising wealth makes it a target of the world's biggest service providers.Google Inc  announced plans last year to use solar-powered balloons to deliver Internet access to remote regions of the world. It has just acquired solar-powered drone maker Titan Aerospace, which is developing ""stratospheric satellites"" that can climb to altitude of 65,000 feet and stay aloft for up to five years.Facebook Inc, the world's biggest Internet social network, is also aiming to connect billions of people who do not currently have Internet access in places such as Africa and Asia and recently announced plans to build solar-powered drones and satellites as part of those efforts.The demand for Internet and data services in Africa has been driven by affordable mobile broadband connections. Mobile broadband users could grow by nearly eight times to 806 million by the end of 2018, according to Informa estimates.New services such as digital television, onboard Internet connection for passenger aircraft, and delivering education and health services electronically will also drive demand. The private sector has several initiatives to extend the capacity from submarine cables inland using terrestrial cables.Liquid Telecom, a subsidiary of Econet Wireless Global, is building a fibre network across southern Africa covering Botswana, Democratic Republic of Congo, Lesotho, South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe.In addition, the Central African Backbone project, which is backed by the World Bank, is working to connect countries such as Cameroon, Central African Republic and Chad.Africa's newest country South Sudan, aims to lay a fibre-optic network this year to link the capital Juba with submarine cables in east Africa to cut the high cost of using the Internet.It is one of the most expensive countries in Africa for Internet use, with the average retail price bandwidth via satellite currently around $4,000 per megabit (MB), according to a source familiar with the industry. The government has said that construction of fibe-optic cables could more than halve prices and double the speed of Internet services.Until capacity bottlenecks are addressed, satellite operators are innovating to plug the black hole in parts of Africa.One operator, O3B, or Other 3 Billion, whose investors include SES, Google and HSBC, has launched four of the next-generation medium earth orbit (MEO) satellites and plans two other launches in 2014 to make an orbital constellation of 12.At a height of 8,000 kms (5,000 miles), the MEO units allow for faster speeds than traditional stationary satellites at 36,000 kms.O3B's tests have delivered capacity five times better than what traditional satellites can manage, making its technology suitable for both voice and interactive applications, said Omar Trujillo, vice president for Africa and Latin America.O3B already has 20 customers signed up and Trujillo expects that satellite will be the main connection for most of its clients, other than a fall-back plan for when fibre fails.""A lot of applications for mining, oil and gas, will continue to be done by satellite,"" he said. ""The main market may not be international links for Nairobi or Johannesburg but will be communication for some of these remote areas that have had very low demand before, but now have fast-growing demand.""

193,"   By Chuck Mikolajczak | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Earnings season shifts into high gear next week, and with nearly one-third of S&P 500 names set to post results, investors hope the news provides a catalyst to buy stocks and leave the market's recent weakness in the dust.Several behemoths, including Apple, the largest U.S. company by market value, as well as Microsoft, McDonald's (MCD.N) and AT&T (T.N), are due to report earnings.They'll be accompanied by highfliers like Netflix and Facebook, giving the first real cross-section of the state of corporate America as temperatures rise across the country and investors hope to put the cold weather behind them. Strategists will also be looking for clues on how badly China's slowdown hits U.S. corporate results.The first batch of earnings came out as equities were working their way through a selloff led by trading-crowd favorites like Netflix and the biotech stocks. With the late-week recovery, the hope is that the recent volatility has ebbed. If poor results dominate next week's action, that could reignite the selling.""We are still off our highs, but we still remain in an uptrend so it would not surprise me to see sideways action,"" said Andre Bakhos, managing director at Janlyn Capital LLC in Bernardsville, New Jersey.""If we were to have a set of earnings releases that were well off expectations to the downside, that could create hesitation in the market.""A few themes will dominate in the coming week: The outlook for China, the rotation to slower-growing stocks, and results from high-flying trading favorites.S&P 500 companies' first-quarter earnings are projected to have increased 1.7 percent from a year ago, Thomson Reuters data showed. The forecast is down sharply from the start of the year, when profit growth was estimated at 6.5 percent, but has climbed from a low of 0.6 percent reached on Wednesday.That jump occurred despite notable disappointments from IBM Corp (IBM.N) and Google Inc (GOOGL.O). Even with those two lackluster reports, equities still mostly rallied on Thursday.The benchmark S&P index rose 2.7 percent for the holiday-shortened week, helping the index recapture nearly all of the declines suffered in the previous week.

THE CHINA CHALLENGE Investors eyeing the impact of China's troubles on corporate America's bottom line will have a few spots to pick from, including Apple (AAPL.O), Qualcomm (QCOM.O) and Yum Brands(YUM.N).There have been warning signs, with IBM saying this week that its disappointing quarterly revenue was due to worsening sales in the world's second-largest economy and other emerging markets. Earlier in the week, China reported growth came in at its slowest pace in 18 months.Qualcomm's (QCOM.O) revenue for its fiscal year ended September 29, 2013, showed China accounted for nearly half of the company's revenue. Options activity in Qualcomm has been defensive in nature, with investors paying more money to hedge against a fall than a rise in the stock's price. But strategists at Goldman Sachs see this as a buying opportunity, believing the options data shows investors are overly concerned about the quarter.Apple Inc (AAPL.O) also derives 13 percent of its sales from China, according to Thomson Reuters data. The company was once a favorite among momentum investors looking to capitalize on swift price gains, but the stock dropped sharply from all-time highs reached in late 2012. It has been mostly stuck in a range for the last year.StarMine expects Apple to exceed earnings estimates by 1 percent.

Investors are gearing up for wild swings in those names next week. Trading in Facebook options expiring next Friday suggest investors expect about a 12 percent move in the stock's price by the end of next week. Weekly options are often used in advance of a major event like earnings. Similarly, Netflix options also suggest a 12 percent move.After a spectacular performance in 2013, the selloff in many of these stocks over the past few weeks has contributed to the market's volatility. Whether they affect the broader market may determine how well stocks trade next week.The Nasdaq biotech index .NBI is down nearly 19 percent from its closing high on February 25 while the Global X Social Media Index ETF (SOCL.O) is down 18 percent from its March 6 high.

195,"   By Tim McLaughlin | BOSTON  BOSTON One of the biotechnology sector's worst two-week declines in the past decade has clobbered one of Fidelity Investments' hottest funds.The $9.4 billion Fidelity Select Biotechnology Fund plunged 11.75 percent during the first 14 days of April. That put the fund near the bottom among nearly 3,800 U.S. mutual funds tracked by Lipper Inc. Only six funds performed worse, but they had less than $100 million in assets each.It's a jarring reversal of fortune for Fidelity portfolio manager Rajiv Kaul, whose three-year return has averaged 31 percent, beating his benchmark by a whopping 21 percentage points over that time.Kaul has built up an outsize bet on Gilead Sciences Inc over the past two years. It is the fund's largest holding at 13 percent of assets, but it is down 9 percent in the past month amid a backlash over the high cost of its $84,000 hepatitis C drug. Kaul was not available to comment.U.S. biotech funds fell an average of 7.25 percent during the first half of April. In comparison, that sector's returns have been better nearly 99 percent of the time on a rolling two-week basis during the past decade, said Jeff Tjornehoj, head of Lipper Americas Research.Biotech's swift downturn was part of a broader sell off of Internet and software stocks that hobbled some of the U.S. mutual fund industry's best stock pickers. Gold funds beat all comers as the $1.3 billion First Eagle Gold Fund led with a nearly 5 percent gain in the first half of April, according to Lipper.Fidelity portfolio manager Will Danoff, who runs the behemoth $109 billion Contrafund, also got walloped in recent weeks probably because he had loaded up on shares of Netflix Inc and Workday Inc over the past year. Contrafund had holdings in these companies at the end of February, and gave no indication of any major changes in his portfolio, according to portfolio commentary released on Wednesday by Fidelity.Contrafund is down 4 percent over the past two weeks. But Danoff, who has a strong long-term record, has had far worse moments as a portfolio manager.During a two-week stretch in 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, Contrafund tanked, declining 23 percent, Tjornehoj said. Danoff, who was not available to comment, has beaten 94 percent of his peers over the past decade.He had more than doubled his bet on NetFlix since June, holding 1.1 million shares at the end of February, according to the latest available fund disclosures. But Netflix shares are off about 23 percent in the past month. His largest holdings included recent losers like Google Inc, Facebook Inc, Biogen Idec Inc and Amazon.com Inc. On Thursday morning, Google's shares declined after reporting disappointing first-quarter results. Workday, a darling of the software as a service movement, also likely hurt Danoff and a number of other mid-cap and large-cap managers. Its shares are down 22 percent in the past month, after more than doubling in the 10 months to February. Danoff more than doubled his stake in Workday over a recent eight-month period, fund disclosures show. At the end of February, Contrafund owned about 7 percent of Workday's outstanding shares.The stock market's two-week revolt against momentum stocks has knocked 2.3 percent off the value of the average U.S. mutual fund, sparing only a handful of money managers who favored gold and emerging markets over cloud software and biotech.""We've seen a collapse in the dream stocks,"" said AllianceBernstein's Gerry Paul, who directly manages $13 billion as chief investment officer of U.S. value funds. To be sure, some of these stocks are coming down from lofty highs - having recorded big gains for their owners last year - and will remain staples in mutual fund portfolios.Among the worst performers, the $527 million Buffalo Emerging Opportunities Fund was down 10 percent during the first two weeks in April after putting up 42 percent average annual gains since the stock market's nadir in March 2009. It is the worst performing small-cap fund with at least $500 million in assets, according to Lipper. The average small-cap fund fell 4.35 percent in the two weeks, according to Lipper.Two of portfolio manager John Bichelmeyer's largest additions to the fund last year, manufacturing software and consulting firm PDF Solutions Inc and cloud software company Proofpoint Inc, continued to sour in April. Proofpoint is down 34 percent in the past month. Bichelmeyer did not return messages seeking comment.Meanwhile, some managers have found an easier way to sleep.They prefer companies with free cash flow yields that top 10 percent. Technology behemoth Hewlett-Packard Co and video games retailer GameStop Corp, for example, meet that criteria and their shares have climbed 12 percent and 5 percent, respectively, in the past month.The $2.5 billion Cullen High Dividend Equity Fund was off only 0.36 percent in the first two weeks of April. That put it at the top of the heap among large cap funds with at least $500 million in assets, Lipper said. Portfolio manager James Cullen has been rewarded for avoiding tech's high flyers.AllianceBernstein's Paul said investors are no longer willing to pay what he called a scarcity premium for companies such as Netflix, Amazon and Facebook. These stocks thrived because they had the ability to grow without the assistance of an economy fueled by the Federal Reserve's easy money policy. But now - as the Fed begins to reduce its stimulus - investors see growth elsewhere and at cheaper values.(Additional reporting by Svea Herbst, Ross Kerber and David Randall; Editing by Richard Valdmanis and Martin Howell)",2014-04-17,FB,"Thu Apr 17, 2014 | 10:27am EDT",Fidelity biotech fund among worst performers in April sell-off,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-usa-funds-stocks-analysis-idUSBREA3G1BS20140417?type=companyNews

198,"   By Tim McLaughlin | BOSTON, April 21  BOSTON, April 21 Will Danoff, who runs Fidelity Investments' behemoth Contrafund, is frustrated by his lagging performance this year and is pruning his exposure to cloud software stocks that got clobbered recently in a swift and hard-hitting downturn.Steering the mutual fund equivalent of a battleship, with $109 billion in assets, Danoff has been one of the best stock pickers over the past 20 years. And that is partly because of his lopsided bets on so-called momentum stocks, particularly big tech companies that don't need a lot of capital to fuel growth.But that hasn't worked well in recent weeks, and while he retains a technology bias he said he is also looking for undervalued stocks outside of the sector.""I'm not complacent,"" he said on Friday in an exclusive telephone interview with Reuters. ""I've had a tough first quarter. I'm looking at each stock in my portfolio and asking, 'How good is this story.'""As it turns out, the valuations of some of the cloud software companies that Contrafund, has been holding, such as Workday Inc and Cornerstone OnDemand Inc , were too good to be true.Workday has dropped 20 percent and Cornerstone has fallen 28 percent in a momentum stocks sell-off during the past month. As a result, Contrafund is down 1.24 percent this year through April 17, lagging the benchmark S&P 500 Index's positive advance of 1.49 percent for the same period. Contrafund  beat the index by 1.76 percentage points last year.But while some portfolio managers have run for cover and have been buying the steady earnings of big oil companies like Exxon Mobil Corp and utility stocks, Danoff says he's not ready to play it safe.""You can play that game, buy Hamburger Helper and buy more integrated oil stocks. But I prefer to test my thesis,"" he said.Danoff said he has trimmed some positions in the cloud software sector, but not the leaders. He didn't provide any details about what he has sold. But he was optimistic about human resources software company Workday's growth trajectory and said the company has a good management team. HUMAN CURIOSITY Contrafund had an $8.8 billion position in Google Inc  and a $2.6 billion stake in Facebook Inc at the end of February, according to the latest available fund disclosures.Danoff still gives both companies a vote of confidence.He described Google's Internet search engine as a proxy for human curiosity. ""Do I want to underweight human curiosity? I don't think so,"" Danoff said.Meanwhile, he conceded that Facebook's February announcement that it would spend $19 billion in stock and cash for WhatsApp, a mobile texting company, raised doubts about Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's founder and chairman.""Should I doubt a 29-year-old who's running a $150 billion company?"" Danoff said. ""He saw an important asset and he sees the future more clearly than I do. He thinks it (WhatsApp) is worth it. Well, we will see.""Danoff says he expects to use the current earnings season as one way to identify companies on a strong growth trajectory, including those outside the tech and biotech sectors. He declined to give any names. He said he's asking Fidelity's army of 150 stock analysts if there are any stocks that other investors have put in the trash can that could be valuable.PRUNING SOME STOCKS He isn't used to running behind the pack.""I'm a little frustrated with my performance,"" Danoff said.Over the past 10 years, Danoff has outperformed 94 percent of his peers in the large-cap growth fund category, according to Morningstar Inc. His 9.85 percent average annual return over that period easily beats the 7.42 percent average advance of the S&P 500 Index.Still, he has seen enough not to panic when there is a sudden reversal in a sector.The sell-off in the software as a service sector reminds Danoff of how Home Depot Inc plunged in the late 1980s when he was a retail stock analyst at Fidelity. Since then, Home Depot's stock has risen to about $87 a share from about 60 cents a share, on a split-adjusted basis.""I don't want to get shaken out of a stock if I like the long-term story,"" Danoff said. ""There are big opportunities in the next couple years. We don't want to batten down the hatches and say we're closed for business. We're definitely open for business.""

206,"   By Wayne Cole | SYDNEY  SYDNEY Asian markets could get a lift on Thursday after tech heavyweights Apple and Facebook beat Wall Street expectations, sending their stock up sharply and boosting Nasdaq futures.The results came out after the close on Wednesday so could not stop the major U.S. indices from ending in the red, but futures pointed to a bounce on Thursday. The Nasdaq futures were up 1 percent and the S&P 500 0.3 percent.Sentiment on the tech sector brightened after Apple decided to buy back $30 billion of its shares out to the end of 2015 and authorized a seven-for-one stock split. Its shares jumped almost 8 percent to $566.50 in after-hours trade.Apple reported sales of 43.7 million iPhones in the quarter ended March, far outpacing forecasts. That drove a 4.6 percent rise in revenue to $45.6 billion, a record for any non-holiday quarter.The iPhone maker's strong performance could have a positive knock-on effect across some of Asia's big tech players in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan.Facebook Inc shares also boasted a 3.7 percent jump after hours as the Internet social networking company topped Wall Street's financial targets. The Nasdaq had ended Wednesday 0.83 percent lower, while the Dow eased 0.08 percent and the S&P 500 lost 0.22 percent.Boeing Co shares were up 2.4 percent after its first-quarter revenue beat expectations, while lifting its core earnings forecast to reflect a tax settlement gain.The main mover in currencies was the New Zealand dollar which hopped higher after the country's central bank raised interest rates by a quarter point to 3 percent and signaled there was more tightening to come.The kiwi dollar gained around a third of a cent to a high of $0.8621 after the announcement. Yet that was the only excitement in a market that has been trading within frustratingly tight ranges recently. The U.S. dollar had barely budged on the yen at 102.49, having yo-yoed in a 101.50 to 104.50 band for almost three months now.Likewise, the euro was little changed at $1.3817 after failing to sustain even the smallest of rallies overnight. It briefly popped up to $1.3854 following better news on euro zone manufacturing, but quickly ran out of steam.The latest performance of manufacturing indices (PMI) showed euro zone businesses enjoyed the best month in nearly three years, led by a jump in Germany. The ""flash"" PMI for the United States dipped a tick to 55.4 in April, missing forecasts of 56.0 but still pointing to solid growth in the sector.However, there was worrying news on U.S. housing as new home sales dived 14.5 percent in March on top of a 4.5 drop in February. The annualized sales pace of 384,000 was the second slowest since late 2012, a blow to what has been a major driver of the U.S. economic recovery.In commodity markets, oil prices dipped on Wednesday after U.S. crude inventories hit a record high, though the continuing crisis in Ukraine kept a floor under the market.Brent crude for June delivery lost 16 cents to $109.11 a barrel. U.S. crude had pared some losses early Thursday to be up 9 cents at $101.53 a barrel.Gold was holding steady around $1,284.50 an ounce but remained uncomfortably close to major chart support at $1,275.(Editing by Shri Navaratnam)",2014-04-23,FB,"Wed Apr 23, 2014 | 7:53pm EDT",Tech sector brightens as Apple jumps 8 percent,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-markets-global-idUSBRE96S00E20140423?type=companyNews

The main mover in currencies was the New Zealand dollar which hopped higher after the country's central bank raised interest rates by a quarter point to 3 percent and signalled there was more tightening to come.The kiwi dollar gained around a third of a cent to a high of $0.8621 after the announcement.Yet that was the only excitement in a market that has been trading within frustratingly tight ranges recently. The U.S. dollar had barely budged on the yen at 102.49, having yo-yoed in a 101.50 to 104.50 band for almost three months now. Likewise, the euro was little changed at $1.3817  after failing to sustain even the smallest of rallies overnight. It briefly popped up to $1.3854 following better news on euro zone manufacturing, but quickly ran out of steam.The latest performance of manufacturing indices (PMI) showed euro zone businesses enjoyed the best month in nearly three years, led by a jump in Germany.The ""flash"" PMI for the United States dipped a tick to 55.4 in April, missing forecasts of 56.0 but still pointing to solid growth in the sector.However, there was worrying news on U.S. housing as new home sales dived 14.5 percent in March on top of a 4.5 drop in February. The annualised sales pace of 384,000 was the second slowest since late 2012, a blow to what has been a major driver of the U.S. economic recovery.In commodity markets, oil prices dipped on Wednesday after U.S. crude inventories hit a record high, though the continuing crisis in Ukraine kept a floor under the market.Brent crude for June delivery lost 16 cents to  $109.11 a barrel. U.S. crude had pared some losses early Thursday to be up 9 cents at $101.53 a barrel.Gold was holding steady around $1,284.50 an ounce but remained uncomfortably close to major chart support at $1,275.

According to Thomson Reuters data, profits are seen rising 1.1 percent this quarter, down from the 6.5 percent growth rate estimated at the start of the year.* Boeing Co reported first-quarter revenue that beat expectations and lifted its core earnings forecast to reflect a tax settlement gain, sending shares up 2.7 percent to $131.05 in premarket trading. Fellow Dow component Procter & Gamble Co's earnings topped analyst forecasts, though shares edged 0.2 percent lower before the bell.* Gilead Sciences Inc rose 3.8 percent to $75.60 in heavy premarket trading a day after the drugmaker reported a sharp profit increase, helped by sales of its hepatitis C drug.

226,"   By Gerry Shih and Edwin Chan | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO There was a time when Twitter strove not to end up like Facebook.As the social media phenom prepared to debut in November, the last thing it wanted was a repeat of its larger rival's rocky IPO and subsequent sell-off. Now, the one-time Wall Street darling's inability to replicate its bigger cousin's success in mobile and online may be what holds it back.Wall Street remains divided over Twitter as the seven-year-old company prepares to unveil only its second set of quarterly numbers on Tuesday. Eleven of 31 investment analysts polled by Thomson Reuters rate it a ""sell,"" outnumbering the seven who deem it a ""buy."" The rest have a hold rating or its equivalent.That's a stark contrast with Facebook and Google, neither of which has a single sell rating to their name. A strong quarterly showing from Facebook last week reflected an amped-up online and mobile advertising market that's likely to have given Twitter a boost.Yet longer-term, investors remain divided over whether Twitter can ever be as mainstream as Facebook.""When Facebook was Twitter's size, Facebook had a 35 percent operating margin. Twitter's is negative 10,"" said Hudson Square's Daniel Ernst, who has a sell rating on Twitter. ""It's an inefficiently structured operation addressing a narrow audience.""Chief Executive Dick Costolo, the architect of Twitter's then-fledgling monetization efforts two years ago, appears to have acknowledged that longstanding criticism with a number of recent moves to try and bring the service into the mainstream. He's introduced Facebook-like user profiles; given photos more prominent placement in tweet-timelines; and allowed people to ""pin"" articles or pictures like Pinterest, to name a few.Many of those efforts came after Twitter in January stunned Wall Street by reporting its slowest pace of user growth in recent company history - just two months after its splashy coming-out party.Since then, Twitter has lost 33 percent of its market value. Yet at $26 billion, the company still trades at 37 times sales, against 19 for Facebook, which boasts almost six times as many users as Twitter.THE VERGE  Indeed, bullish analysts argue that the company is on the cusp of realizing its larger potential. Five months after its debut, Twitter stock remains above $40, versus its $26 offering price.Unlike Facebook, which was caught flat-footed in 2012 when its users migrated to mobile devices, Twitter has always seemed better-poised to make money off of its smartphone user base.The company secured a strategic asset last September when it splashed out $350 million on MoPub, an advertising network that distributes ads within hundreds of mobile apps.MoPub has delivered several technological advancements in recent weeks, including the ability for advertisers to execute cohesive campaigns by placing ads within apps as well as into the Twitter stream simultaneously. Bullish Twitter analysts say there's more to come.Although rivals Google and Facebook dominate mobile advertising, Twitter's ad machine may get a jump-start once it places targeted ads in apps, tailored for users and their interests, which will extend its ad reach far beyond its 241 million users.Indeed, its advocates on Wall Street argue that Twitter is best-placed to grab a significant slice of mammoth TV ad budgets because of its growing presence as the ""second screen"" that TV audiences turn to online, to weigh in on their favorite shows.""Twitter is one of the best plays off two of our 2014 Internet growth factors: increasing mobile materiality and the online migration of TV ad budgets,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney, who has an outperform and $60 price target on the stock, argued in a research note.But the company ""needs to prove two things: that it can successfully increase its reach with advertisers; and that it can successfully increase its user base and engagement levels.""Analysts expect Twitter to have lost almost $159 million, or about 3 cents a share, on revenue of $241.47 million in the January-March quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.(Editing by Bernadette Baum)",2014-04-28,FB,"Mon Apr 28, 2014 | 4:17pm EDT",Wall Street remains split on Twitter's prospects,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-twitter-results-idUSBREA3R16520140428?type=companyNews

232,"   By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed and Supantha Mukherjee  Twitter Inc's slowing user growth has revived concerns about the microblogging service's prospects of one day matching Facebook Inc's 1.2 billion users, prompting at least 16 analysts to cut their target price on the stock.Twitter's shares, which have shed about a third of their value since the beginning of the year, opened down 11 percent at $37.80 on Wednesday, making it one of the top percentage losers on the New York Stock Exchange.Twitter has divided Wall Street into two broad camps: those who consider it an overvalued company with fading potential, and those who believe it to be a phenomenon capable of matching Facebook's growth.A second consecutive quarter of lackluster user growth is testing the patience of investors. Twitter also raised concerns by saying its 255 million monthly users appeared to be checking the service less frequently than a year ago.Of the 12 analysts who initiated coverage on Twitter with a ""buy"" or equivalent rating after the company's high-profile market debut in November, five have since downgraded their view.Ten brokerages, including Bofa Merrill Lynch and UBS, have a ""sell"" or equivalent rating on the shares.There were no downgrades on Wednesday, but analysts cut their price targets on the stock by as much as $18 to a low of $35. ""We continue to expect Twitter's stock to underperform the market in the face of (what is likely) a multiple-quarter transition on user engagement and ad product adoption,"" UBS Equities analyst Eric Sheridan said in a note.Sheridan, who has a ""sell"" rating on Twitter shares, cut his target price on the stock to $35 from $42.Twitter's first-quarter results revealed slowing momentum at a company that exuberant investors just six months ago had argued could one day match Facebook's scale. At its peak in December, Twitter enjoyed a $46 billion market capitalization on just $665 million of revenue in 2013, making it one of the world's priciest stocks. As of Tuesday's close, the company's market capitalization was $25.1 billion.Twitter shares trade at 349.3 times forward earnings, far more than Facebook's 37.1 times, according to StarMine.Analysts also expressed concerns about Twitter's shares coming under pressure after May 5, when restrictions on the sale of shares by early investors will be lifted.The company's co-founders, Jack Dorsey and Evan Williams, and Chief Executive Richard Costolo said this month that they do not plan to sell their shares after the post-IPO restrictions are lifted. While Twitter's quarterly results raised some concerns, at least seven brokerages, including Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank, still see the company as a sound bet.""The company continues to execute near-flawlessly around items in its control like revenue and expenses, but sentiment remains pinned on lackluster MAU (monthly average user) growth,"" Deutsche Bank analyst Ross Sandler wrote in a note.Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank were lead underwriters for Twitter's IPO.Sandler said market sentiment would eventually shift away from users toward revenue growth - just like it did during Facebook's ""rough patch"" last year.Facebook struggled with slow user growth last year, drawing criticism from investors and analysts alike, but has since regained Wall Street's favor thanks to its strong mobile ad business.(Editing by Robin Paxton)",2014-04-30,FB,"Wed Apr 30, 2014 | 12:32pm EDT",Slowing Twitter user growth tests Wall Street's patience,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-twitter-results-growth-idUSBREA3T0C020140430?type=companyNews
233,"   By Mary Milliken | LOS ANGELES  LOS ANGELES As the star of the new HBO tech-world comedy ""Silicon Valley,"" Thomas Middleditch might be channeling an early version of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, with his hoodie, ginger hair, social awkwardness and twitchy nervousness.""But it's not a one-to-one Zuckerberg,"" says show director Mike Judge (of ""Beavis and Butt-head"" fame), while Judge's collaborator Alec Berg says ""there was never a moment in any of this that was like 'Do it more Zuckerberg.'""Until he landed the lead role of Richard, a computer programmer with a coveted compression algorithm, the 32-year-old Middleditch had played mostly smaller, ""crazy guy"" parts. Now, the comedy writer and actor gets a second season after HBO renewed ""Silicon Valley"" based on good reviews and ratings for the first few episodes of season one. Middleditch talked to Reuters about his own nerdy back story, his big step up to an HBO show and the challenge of replicating his director's panic-induced vomiting.Q: Mike Judge says you've done some programming. A: I've made HTML, built some websites, figured out some Flash stuff ... little computer programs like that, on my own, but I wouldn't call myself a coder.Q: How has that experience working with technology helped your development of your character, Richard?A: I know nowadays I come across as a very social, really cool person. But in elementary, junior high, high school, I had a very nerdy background, not only in computer programming, but also in videogames and nerdy stuff. That all definitely helped connect with the world.I definitely have had experiences in life that draw on the sort of guy that is just focused on the one thing and not much else. Richard is one of those guys ... he's like a little hamster on a wheel going away, trying to figure out the next thing.Q: What's with Richard retching after he gets two competing offers for his start-up? A: That panic attack-vomity stuff is something that has happened to Mike Judge, actually.

That's the big thing, not only for Richard but a lot of these guys in Silicon Valley that strike it rich in the tech gold mine: they suddenly have gone from normal coder guy to CEO or position of authority.You also see the mounting pressure that is on his shoulders as he tries to get things done for deadline and as you see these two billionaires play God over him.Q: Did you do research, meeting guys in incubators, start-ups and even the more successful people in the Valley? A: You know, I haven't met too many people, and if I had, I probably wouldn't know it. Most of them are normal guys.This is where I have got to give props to Mike and Alec and all those guys. They did a ton of research and I just walked in and saw it was covered and thought, 'OK, good.' Call me a lazy actor, but hopefully I haven't outed myself.Q: Does Richard have an element of Mark Zuckerberg?A: I think probably all these guys have a sprinkling of Zuckerberg, but is that a sprinkling of Zuckerberg or just some other quality that Zuckerberg shares with all these guys? In my approach to the role, I had to be very aware of ""The Social Network"" and the portrayal of him, so I definitely tried my best not to do a copy.Q: What one thing in the show makes you laugh hardest? A: Dang it. It is in an episode to come. And it is such a good bit that I don't want to tell you about it.But I can answer in a sadly generic way. What's cool about this show is that you have all these great writers, but they allow us to improvise these little moments. And in all these episodes you will find a handful of these, just these little nuggets, these little exchanges, looks that are like quiet awkwardness.Q: What does this role represent in your career?A: Oh man. For me, up to this point, I do comedy and a lot of my opportunities have been the crazy guy or the walk-on guy  or just like the silly character. So for me to play this lead character is very fortunate. I definitely recognize the chance that it is. It is a dream to be on HBO.I would go around Hollywood trying to peddle my TV show idea and I would always say 'HBO, well that's impossible, so what else can we do?' But here I am on HBO, directed by Mike Judge of all people. And a lot of these guys in the show are my friends.

236,"  (Adds additional flows, analyst comments, table)     By Sam Forgione     NEW YORK, May 1 Investors in U.S.-based funds poured $4.2 billion into stock funds in the week ended April 30 after strong corporate earnings from companies such as Apple  and Facebook boosted sentiment, data from Thomson Reuters' Lipper service showed on Thursday.      The inflows into stock funds marked their strongest demand in three weeks. Stock mutual funds, which are commonly purchased by retail investors, attracted $1.6 billion of the net inflows, while stock exchange-traded funds attracted $2.6 billion. Stock ETFs are thought to represent the institutional investor.      ""People are looking optimistically at equities as the market leader,"" said Jeff Tjornehoj, head of Americas research at Lipper, on the greater demand for stocks over the week. Taxable bond funds attracted just $711 million over the weekly period.      Emerging markets stock funds attracted $352 million in inflows, marking their sixth straight week of inflows. Investors have poured cash into the funds in recent weeks on growing comfort that the Federal Reserve's pullback in its bond-buying program has proceeded smoothly, Tjornehoj of Lipper said.      The benchmark Standard & Poor's 500 stock index rose 0.5 percent over the weekly period on strong corporate results and the Fed's view that the U.S. economy was showing signs of strength despite weak data for the first quarter.      The Dow also closed at its first record high of 2014 on Wednesday after the Fed's gave its upbeat economic outlook as it announced another cut to its massive bond-buying program.     The inflows in the taxable bond funds were the smallest in eight weeks. Riskier high-yield bond funds posted $631 million in outflows, marking their biggest outflows since February. Investment-grade bond funds posted $74 million in outflows, marking their first withdrawals since October 2013.     ""Investors are thinking that prospects are looking more favorable for stocks than bonds,"" Tjornehoj said on the outflows from corporate bonds.     Floating-rate loan funds posted $663.7 million in outflows, marking their biggest outflows since August 2011. Analysts have said the belief that the Fed will not raise rates earlier than expected has hurt demand for the funds, which are protected from rising interest rates by being pegged to floating-rate benchmarks.      Funds that mainly hold safe-haven U.S. Treasuries attracted $440 million in inflows, marking their second straight week of new demand. Funds that hold inflation-protected bonds such as Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities attracted $174 million, marking their second straight week of new demand after five weeks of outflows.     ""I would speculate that a softer, more dovish Fed is encouraging some investors to more strongly consider inflation,"" Tjornehoj said.     The strong inflows into stock funds showed investors putting more money to work. Investors pulled $5.5 billion out of money market funds, which are low-risk vehicles that typically invest in safe short-term securities, after committing $4.9 billion to the funds the previous week.      The weekly Lipper fund flow data is compiled from reports issued by U.S.-domiciled mutual funds and exchange-traded funds.     The following is a broad breakdown of the flows for the week, including exchange-traded funds (in $ billions):   Sector                Flow Chg   % Assets  Assets      Count                        ($Bil)               ($Bil)        All Equity Funds      4.158      0.10      4,018.982   10,715  Domestic Equities     2.127      0.07      2,974.824   7,823  Non-Domestic          2.031      0.20      1,044.158   2,892  Equities                                                 All Taxable Bond      0.711      0.04      1,754.356   5,403  Funds                                                    All Money Market      -5.542     -0.24     2,274.888   1,316  Funds                                                    All Municipal Bond    -0.026     -0.01     286.400     1,442  Funds                                                      (Reporting by Sam Forgione; Editing by Diane Craft)   ",2014-05-01,FB,"Thu May 1, 2014 | 6:38pm EDT",UPDATE 1-U.S.-based stock funds attract $4.2 bln over week - Lipper,http://www.reuters.com//article/investing-fundflows-lipper-idUSL2N0NN1V120140501?type=companyNews

238,"   By Supantha Mukherjee and Saqib Iqbal Ahmed  Twitter Inc investors who heeded the advice of high-profile banks such as Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Deutsche Bank AG to buy the social media company's shares might be kicking themselves.Much more accurate calls were made by Wells Fargo, Atlantic Equities and Macquarie Research, whose analysts advised clients to get out of the high-flying stock about the time it peaked in December.On Wednesday the stock fell as low as $37.24, 50 percent below its peak of $74.73 the day after Christmas, wiping almost $18 billion off Twitter's market capitalization.The downgrades, and the subsequent swoon by the stock, reflect concern about slowing growth in Twitter's user base and the company's ability to reverse the trend. Year-on-year growth in the number of Twitter users has fallen for five straight quarters, and the company said on Tuesday that its 255 million monthly users, on average, appeared to check the service less frequently than a year ago.That in turn has fueled doubts that Twitter could one day attract as many users as Facebook Inc's 1.2 billion, or match its much larger rival's power as an advertising vehicle. It's also raised questions over whether it can sustain growth over the long term. While no one is suggesting Twitter will lose its consumer cachet as happened to companies such as MySpace or Orkut, neither can anyone guarantee that as tastes change newer rivals won't usurp it.""Can they become a mainstream company? That's the open question,"" said Ben Schachter, the Macquarie Securities analyst who downgraded Twitter's stock to ""underperform"" on December 27 - the day after it peaked.It's a far cry from the enthusiasm that greeted the company when it debuted on the New York Stock Exchange on November 7 and its shares soared 73 percent over the offering price. There was no let-up for the next two months, as the stock scaled fresh highs with little or no news to justify the valuation.That got some analysts worried. Schachter, speaking to Reuters on Thursday, recalls a ""runaway momentum.""Starting mid-December, seven brokerages downgraded the stock within a span of three weeks. Wells Fargo and SunTrust Robinson kicked off the first round of downgrades on December 16, followed by Atlantic Equities. Macquarie timed its downgrade to perfection.In his downgrade note on December 16, Wells Fargo analyst Peter Stabler said investors were ""underestimating the challenges facing the company"". A common theme was that Twitter, though innovative, well-run and full of potential, simply did not warrant such a rich valuation, so soon.""They are focusing on the right things. I only have positive things to say about the company. My quibble is with the stock,"" said Brian Wieser, Pivotal Research Group analyst, who was among the first to urge clients to retreat.He downgraded the stock to ""sell"" immediately after Twitter's shares jumped on its opening day. At the time, he had a $30 target price on the stock and recommended selling after they breached the $45 level in their market debut.THE RISKS Twitter said in 2010 that it aims one day to have 1 billion users. It did not specify a time frame. (r.reuters.com/pyf98v) Some of the analysts who downgraded the stock in December are not as confident in Twitter's long-term outlook, much of which will hinge on the company's ability to increase both the number of users and how much time they spend on the site.A fast-growing and engaged user base would help Twitter rake in more advertiser dollars; however, those are issues over which management has limited control, Atlantic Equities analyst James Cordwell said in December.Investor worries were reflected in the response to Twitter's quarterly results this week, when the market overlooked higher-than-expected revenue to focus instead on the slow user and usage growth. Twitter's shares fell 10 percent.The expiration on May 5 of Twitter's six-month ""lockup"" - the period after the initial public offering during which early investors are barred from selling their shares - could put the stock under more pressure. Restrictions on about 470 million shares will be removed.Twitter's co-founders, Jack Dorsey and Evan Williams, and Chief Executive Richard Costolo have said they do not plan to sell their shares after the post-IPO restrictions are lifted. Only one other major investor, Benchmark Capital Management Co LLC, which owns 31.6 million shares, has publicly stated that it will not sell the stock when the lock-up expires.""Despite some key investor and executive statements that they will not sell near term, we estimate that 50-70 percent of shares could be unlocked,"" JPMorgan Chase & Co analyst Doug Anmuth said in a research note on April 30.THE OTHER CAMP Still, Goldman and Deutsche Bank, both underwriters of the high-profile IPO, maintain their positive views of the stock, in spite of the user trends, two consecutive quarters of disappointing results and the decline in its shares.Twitter shares trade at 334.2 times forward earnings, far more than Facebook's 38.1 times, according to StarMine, or the average of 17.95 for the Standard & Poor's 500 Index, according to Thomson Reuters data.""The company continues to execute near-flawlessly around items in its control like revenue and expenses,"" Deutsche Bank analyst Ross Sandler wrote in a note on Thursday, a day after Twitter posted its second-quarter results. Sandler didn't immediately return a phone call and an e-mail. Goldman Sachs analyst Heath Terry was traveling and not available for comment, his assistant said.Sandler said market sentiment would eventually shift away from users toward revenue growth. Facebook, he argued, also struggled with slow user growth last year before regaining Wall Street's favor thanks to its strong mobile ad business.Schachter, the Macquarie analyst, says much will depend on how successful Twitter will be in revamping its site to attract mainstream users.""They are executing well in terms of innovation, but the user growth is a bit of a concern,"" he said. ""The hope is that they can change the site, to make it more user-friendly.""(Additional reporting by Anannya Pramanick in Bangalore; Editing by Robin Paxton and John Pickering)",2014-05-02,FB,"Fri May 2, 2014 | 1:02am EDT","Twitter stock slumps 50 percent as Goldman, Deutsche Bank still say `buy'",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-twitter-stocks-analysis-idUSBREA4103Y20140502?type=companyNews
239,"   By Noel Randewich | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO In the shadow of Internet monoliths such as Facebook, Google and Twitter, it's easy to forget that Silicon Valley got its start from hard-scrabble tinkerers building radios, microchips and other devices.Now, a proliferation of high-tech but affordable manufacturing tools and new sources of funding are empowering a generation of handy entrepreneurs and laying the foundation for a hardware renaissance.Inventors are working on projects as varied as drones, improved artificial limbs, smart jewelry and handheld devices for detecting gluten in food.Google in January acquired four-year-old smart thermostat maker Nest Labs for $3.2 billion. Facebook in March spent $2 billion on virtual reality headset startup Oculus Rift, founded by a college dropout in his parents' garage. 3D printer maker MakerBot Industries was sold for $400 million in 2013 to Stratasys Inc - just three years after it was cofounded by a former art teacher.All of them embody the growing focus on hardware and the so-called ""Maker movement"" sweeping northern California and, in a smaller way, Europe and other countries. Renewed interest in tinkering with objects - versus apps or software - is attracting more money from investors and fostering a growing number of workshops, where aspiring inventors can get their hands on computerized milling machines and other high-end tools.""Two and a half years ago when we were started, it was rough,"" said Jeremy Conrad, co-founder of Lemnos Labs, an incubator that provides funding, tools and guidance for startups working on physical products. ""Now we have more relationships with venture capitalists who are interested in hardware than we have companies to fund.""The growing wave of do-it-yourselfers may hold the key to manufacturing innovation. President Barack Obama sees children who are ""makers of things, not just consumers of things"" as a step toward rebuilding a withered U.S. manufacturing industry.A decade ago, free, open-source code slashed the cost and complexity of starting a software company, sparking a boom in Internet and social media startups founded by twenty-something, self-taught programmers. Now hardware is catching up to the open-source revolution, with common standards and a culture that encourages the sharing of designs and building blocks that save inventors the time and expense of reinventing the wheel.Take the palm-sized ""Arduino"" computer board, ubiquitous in the maker movement. The roughly $20 item was developed for students, offering low price and relatively easy programming. Arduino lets do-it-yourselfers snap together and program interchangeable components such as GPS chips and motor controllers to run everything from robots to cocktail mixers.KNITTING TO ROBOTICS From families to entrepreneurs, growing numbers of people are rolling up their sleeves and discovering how much easier it has become to make things with their hands.The advent of community workshops, often called hackerspaces, allow like-minded people to collaborate on everything from knitting to drones and often provide industrial tools - including laser-cutters and 3D printers - too expensive for most people to buy on their own. TechShop, one of the largest in its field, charges members a monthly fee for classes and access to tools, and has grown to eight locations around the country and 6,000 members since its first outlet opened in 2006.While hackerspaces have existed for years in Europe and are expanding in Asia, northern California's technology legacy has made it a maker Mecca.Today's do-it-yourselfers follow a storied tradition in the San Francisco Bay area, where amateurs dabbled with early radios a century ago and electronics enthusiasts in the 1970s formed the Homebrew Computer Club, a group whose members included Apple Inc co-founder Steve Wozniak.Maker festivals have become major venues for hobbyists to show off their projects and hob-nob.

240,"  (Corrects 12th paragraph to show TechShop has eight locations, not nine)By Noel RandewichSAN FRANCISCO May 6 In the shadow of Internet monoliths such as Facebook, Google and Twitter , it's easy to forget that Silicon Valley got its start from hard-scrabble tinkerers building radios, microchips and other devices.Now, a proliferation of high-tech but affordable manufacturing tools and new sources of funding are empowering a generation of handy entrepreneurs and laying the foundation for a hardware renaissance.Inventors are working on projects as varied as drones, improved artificial limbs, smart jewelry and handheld devices for detecting gluten in food.Google in January acquired four-year-old smart thermostat maker Nest Labs for $3.2 billion. Facebook in March spent $2 billion on virtual reality headset startup Oculus Rift, founded by a college dropout in his parents' garage. 3D printer maker MakerBot Industries was sold for $400 million in 2013 to Stratasys Inc - just three years after it was cofounded by a former art teacher.All of them embody the growing focus on hardware and the so-called ""Maker movement"" sweeping northern California and, in a smaller way, Europe and other countries. Renewed interest in tinkering with objects - versus apps or software - is attracting more money from investors and fostering a growing number of workshops, where aspiring inventors can get their hands on computerized milling machines and other high-end tools.""Two and a half years ago when we were started, it was rough,"" said Jeremy Conrad, co-founder of Lemnos Labs, an incubator that provides funding, tools and guidance for startups working on physical products. ""Now we have more relationships with venture capitalists who are interested in hardware than we have companies to fund.""The growing wave of do-it-yourselfers may hold the key to manufacturing innovation. President Barack Obama sees children who are ""makers of things, not just consumers of things"" as a step toward rebuilding a withered U.S. manufacturing industry.A decade ago, free, open-source code slashed the cost and complexity of starting a software company, sparking a boom in Internet and social media startups founded by twenty-something, self-taught programmers. Now hardware is catching up to the open-source revolution, with common standards and a culture that encourages the sharing of designs and building blocks that save inventors the time and expense of reinventing the wheel.Take the palm-sized ""Arduino"" computer board, ubiquitous in the maker movement. The roughly $20 item was developed for students, offering low price and relatively easy programming. Arduino lets do-it-yourselfers snap together and program interchangeable components such as GPS chips and motor controllers to run everything from robots to cocktail mixers.KNITTING TO ROBOTICS  From families to entrepreneurs, growing numbers of people are rolling up their sleeves and discovering how much easier it has become to make things with their hands.The advent of community workshops, often called hackerspaces, allow like-minded people to collaborate on everything from knitting to drones and often provide industrial tools - including laser-cutters and 3D printers - too expensive for most people to buy on their own.TechShop, one of the largest in its field, charges members a monthly fee for classes and access to tools, and has grown to eight locations around the country and 6,000 members since its first outlet opened in 2006.While hackerspaces have existed for years in Europe and are expanding in Asia, northern California's technology legacy has made it a maker Mecca.Today's do-it-yourselfers follow a storied tradition in the San Francisco Bay area, where amateurs dabbled with early radios a century ago and electronics enthusiasts in the 1970s formed the Homebrew Computer Club, a group whose members included Apple Inc co-founder Steve Wozniak.Maker festivals have become major venues for hobbyists to show off their projects and hob-nob.

241,"  (Adds closing share price)By Gerry Shih and Supantha MukherjeeMay 6 Shares of Twitter Inc sank 18 percent to a new low in frenzied trading on Tuesday, wiping out more than $4 billion of its market value, as early investors sold stock in the messaging service for the first time after a six-month ""lock-up"" expired.The stock closed at $31.85 on the New York Stock Exchange, as losses deepened late in the session to the lowest since its debut on Nov. 7 at $37. On a consolidated basis, more than 130 million shares changed hands - 10 times the daily average volume for the last 50 days.The lock-up agreement that expired this week applied to about 470 million shares, or 82 percent of Twitter's equity, held by insiders, venture capitalists and other investors. Twitter allowed one batch of shares to be sold in February, but that lockup governed only about 10 million shares, most of which were held by non-executive employees.""The move is bigger than expected and is indicative of the negative investor sentiment towards Twitter right now,"" Atlantic Equities analyst James Cordwell told Reuters.Tuesday's reaction to Twitter's lock-up expiry was in sharp contrast to that of Facebook Inc in late 2012. Facebook shares jumped 13 percent on Nov. 14 that year, when its lock-up expiry of roughly 800 million shares did not trigger an immediate wave of insider selling.Twitter's shares have been trading at all-time lows since April 29, when the company disclosed sagging usage metrics. Indeed, concerns about user growth and engagement levels have wiped out about half of Twitter's market value, more than $18 billion, since late December, even as it has hit revenue targets in the two quarters since it went public at $26 a share.The stock does not look cheap either, despite the declines. Before Tuesday's selloff, Twitter shares were trading at 323 times forward earnings per share, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine. Facebook trades at about 39 times.""I am starting to think that sentiment might have got too negative, but I don't see anything that can turn this around in the near term,"" Cordwell said. The largest holder of Twitter shares, private equity firm Rizvi Traverse, had no intention of selling when the lockup expired, a spokesman for the firm said on Friday.Rizvi Traverse, which owns about 85.2 million Twitter shares, could not be reached for comment on Tuesday.Lowercase Capital, which also holds a significant stake in Twitter, said Monday it had no intention of selling its shares. Twitter co-founders Jack Dorsey and Evan Williams and Chief Executive Dick Costolo said in April they did not plan to sell shares after the restrictions were lifted.Venture capital firm Benchmark, which holds a roughly 6 percent stake, has also said it would not sell its stake.But other major shareholders could see an opportunity to cash out, given that none of Twitter's insiders sold their shares during the initial public offering.Large shareholders include venture capital firms Union Square Ventures and Spark Capital. Spark declined to comment, while Union Square Ventures could not be immediately reached.Many tech companies have a lock-up clause to prevent holders from flooding the market as soon as the company goes public.(Additional reporting by Soham Chatterjee; Editing by Savio D'Souza, Ted Kerr, Bernadette Baum and Richard Chang)",2014-05-06,FB,"Tue May 6, 2014 | 4:56pm EDT",UPDATE 4-Twitter shares plumb new lows as stock lock-up expires,http://www.reuters.com//article/twitter-lockup-idUSL3N0NS3D220140506?type=companyNews
242,"   By Jonathan Stempel  A Wall Street regulator fined a Morgan Stanley wealth management unit $5 million on Tuesday for supervisory failures related to the sale of shares to retail customers in 83 initial public offerings, including Facebook Inc and Yelp Inc.The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Wall Street's self-funded regulator, said Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC lacked adequate procedures and training to ensure that sales staff distinguished between ""indications of interest"" and ""conditional offers"" when soliciting investors for IPOs whose registration statements had not yet become effective.Finra said the lapses occurred from February 16, 2012, to May 1, 2013.The regulator said the unit treated the phrases interchangeably, even though indications of interest lead to share purchases only if investors reconfirm them, while conditional offers to buy can result in binding share purchases unless investors revoke them.

""There must not be ambiguity regarding the customer's obligations given the significant legal differences between an indication of interest and a conditional offer to buy.""The regulator said the confusion was the result of Morgan Stanley's effort to reconcile different policies at Morgan Stanley and Citigroup Inc, which had created Morgan Stanley Smith Barney in a 2009 joint venture. Morgan Stanley took full ownership of the business last June. Morgan Stanley was the world's largest underwriter of IPOs by fees in 2013, with a 9.5 percent share, according to Thomson Reuters data.

245,"  (Adds intention of FCC to move ahead with proposals at May 15 meeting)By Alina SelyukhWASHINGTON May 7 Over 100 leading technology companies, including Google Inc, Facebook Inc, Twitter Inc and Amazon.com Inc, have written to U.S. telecom regulators to oppose a new ""net neutrality"" plan that would regulate how Internet providers manage web traffic.The letter to Federal Communications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler and the agency's four commissioners, warning of a ""grave threat to the Internet,"" came amid calls for a delay in a vote on the plan scheduled for May 15.""Rushing headlong into a rulemaking next week fails to respect the public response to his (Wheeler's) proposal,"" FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel said on Wednesday in remarks prepared for delivery to an industry meeting. She called for a delay of ""at least a month"" on Wheeler's plan. FCC spokesman Neil Grace said Wheeler still intends to put forward his proposals for public comment next week, as planned, as part of a ""robust public debate"" on the Internet.""Moving forward will allow the American people to review and comment on the proposed plan without delay, and bring us one step closer to putting rules on the books to protect consumers and entrepreneurs online,"" Grace said in a statement. With two Republican commissioners broadly opposed to  regulation of Internet traffic, the support of two Democrats on the panel - Rosenworcel and Mignon Clyburn - is critical.Tens of thousands of public comments have been received by the FCC on Wheeler's plan over the past two weeks, and commission staff has met with nearly 100 stakeholders, including public interest groups and Internet content providers. The latest to weigh in is the consortium of technology and Internet companies, which ranged from household names to small startups. They called on the FCC to ""take the necessary steps to ensure that the Internet remains an open platform for speech and commerce.""Commission rules should not permit ""individualized bargaining and discrimination,"" the companies said.Engine Advocacy and New America's Open Technology Institute, long-time supporters of Open Internet policies,  helped organize the effort.(Reporting by Alina Selyukh; Editing by Ros Krasny, Sandra Maler and Jan Paschal)",2014-05-07,FB,"Wed May 7, 2014 | 7:07pm EDT",UPDATE 2-Tech firms write to U.S. FCC to oppose 'net neutrality' plan,http://www.reuters.com//article/netneutrality-companies-idUSL2N0NT2KL20140507?type=companyNews

248,"  * Chinese e-commerce giant files for most anticipated IPO since Facebook* Yahoo set to sell nearly half its stake in Alibaba IPO* Co-founders Ma, Tsai among largest individual Alibaba shareholders   (Adds proceeds, financial data, estimated value)By Alexei Oreskovic and Deepa SeetharamanSAN FRANCISCO, May 6 Alibaba gave investors a closer look at the scale and growth of the Chinese e-commerce juggernaut in an initial public offering (IPO) prospectus filed on Tuesday, the first step in what could be the largest technology debut in history.Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, which powers 80 percent of all online commerce in the world's second-largest economy, is expected to raise more than $15 billion, and could top the $16 billion pulled in by Facebook Inc when it listed in 2012.The bulk of the proceeds will go to Yahoo Inc - which bought a 40 percent stake in Alibaba in 2005 for $1 billion and which must sell more than a third of its current 22.6 percent stake through the IPO. Alibaba also plans to sell new shares, people familiar with the plans have said, to bulk up a cash war chest depleted by a rash of recent acquisitions.While the Alibaba brand is less well known in the United States than Internet companies such as Amazon.com and Facebook, the Chinese company's listing has stirred the most excitement in Silicon Valley and Wall Street since Facebook's record IPO. Alibaba will become the largest Chinese corporation to list in the U.S. - on either the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq.Alibaba will debut later this year in a market where high-flying tech stocks like Twitter and Amazon have fallen in recent weeks in a sell-off that has divided analysts and investors, reviving doubts about soaring tech valuations.Still, estimates of Alibaba's market value have soared in recent months, to even beyond $200 billion, underscoring Wall Street's eagerness to take a crack at a massive Chinese company with robust growth.Alibaba handled more than 1.5 trillion yuan - about $248 billion - of transactions for 231 million active users across its three main Chinese online marketplaces in 2013, more than Amazon and eBay Inc combined. It did so with 20,884 full-time workers, fewer than eBay.""If it's able to transport that kind of power to outside China, it has the potential to become a true global e-commerce powerhouse,"" said Roger Entner, lead analyst and founder of Recon Analytics. ""Everybody thought Amazon could do it, but now we have to re-think Amazon in the light of being the most successful company in that field in the U.S. - but not in the world.""Alibaba did not give any hints in its IPO prospectus about potential plans for the U.S. e-commerce market. Analysts said it was unlikely Alibaba would adopt the model favored by Amazon, which sells goods directly to consumers using a sprawling network of warehouses.AT LEAST 102 YEARS  Alibaba, founded 15 years ago in a one-room apartment in Hangzhou and controlled by a 28-member partnership, boasts of building a company that will last ""at least 102 years.""After the IPO, Alibaba said, the partnership will have the exclusive right to nominate a simple majority of the members of its board of directors.Alibaba operates an online messaging service as well as a cloud computing business, but more than 80 percent of its revenue comes from its Taobao, Tmall and Juhuasuan online marketplaces. Top items sold on Taobao include prepaid phone and game cards as well as lottery tickets, home furniture and baby products, the company said.Total revenue increased 62 percent to 18.75 billion yuan ($3.01 billion) in October-December of 2013 from a year earlier, while net income more than doubled to 8.27 billion yuan, according to the prospectus.Some analysts say Alibaba's rapid pace of revenue growth may be unsustainable.""They got into the e-commerce space when there weren't any other players in China,"" said Forrester analyst Kelland Willis, adding Alibaba has been ""losing market share year over year.""By 2020, online retail sales in China will reach $420-$650 billion, as much as the United States, Japanese, UK, German and French markets combined, according to a recent analysis by McKinsey Global Institute. MOBILE FUTURE Alibaba said China's mobile Internet arena, where it is battling Tencent Holdings for supremacy, is the next growth industry. China will have an estimated 750 million mobile Internet users by 2017, according to data from China-based consultancy iResearch.Roughly one-fifth of all purchases in the last quarter of 2013 were made on mobile devices, up from 7.4 percent a year earlier. But Alibaba added that for now these sales were less profitable than those made on its website.Already this year, Ma has been involved in acquisitions worth more than $3.5 billion - buying a stake in department store operator Intime ; a majority shareholding in movie producer ChinaVision Media; control of online mapping firm Autonavi ; a stake in China's Wasu Media Holding Co Ltd  for online content and internet TV; and a stake in Youku Tudou Inc, an online video business akin to Google Inc's YouTube.Alibaba is also launching a U.S. e-commerce website, 11 Main, and has taken stakes in U.S. retail site ShopRunner Inc, Lyft, a U.S. ridesharing service, and 1stdibs, an online market place for antiques and luxuries.Also this year, Ma has set up a charitable trust estimated to be worth $3 billion, potentially Asia's biggest, focusing on the environment and health. ""It's impossible for me to be a doctor, but I can have my own way to save lives,"" Xinhua quoted Ma as saying. OWNERSHIP AND RISKS Some analysts have pointed to a less-than-transparent decision-making process after Alibaba spun off fast-growing Alipay in 2010 - a move that caused consternation at major shareholders Yahoo and Japanese telecoms firm SoftBank Corp .Alibaba's prospectus also laid out a raft of regulatory risks it faces at home. The company stressed that Beijing could impose additional restrictions on the use of Alipay, the payment service that powers the majority of its online transactions.Unlike many prominent U.S. tech IPOs of recent years, Alibaba's list of significant shareholders is short. By contrast, Facebook and Twitter each broke out shareholdings from more than a half dozen individual principal shareholders.Former English schoolteacher and lead founder Jack Ma owns 8.9 percent of Alibaba. Joseph Tsai, a co-founder and executive vice-chairman, is the only other individual with a disclosed shareholding, of 3.6 percent. Yahoo and SoftBank, respectively, own 22.6 percent and 34.4 percent of Alibaba on a fully diluted basis.The proposed IPO of $1 billion in the filing is an estimate for calculating exchange registration fees.FAIR VALUE Alibaba estimated its fair value as of this month could reach $50 per share, an increase of more than six times from the $8 a share value estimated in June 2011, according to the prospectus. This calculation helps determine employee compensation and does not necessarily represent a likely IPO price.At the most recent fair value estimate, Yahoo's stake in Alibaba is worth $26.2 billion and SoftBank's almost $40 billion. Ma's stake would be worth $10.3 billion.The fair value estimate puts Alibaba's size at $116.1 billion, well below the $152 billion average from 25 analysts in a Reuters survey.While Yahoo and SoftBank may be among the biggest beneficiaries of the IPO, neither will exercise much control of Alibaba. It has already been agreed that Yahoo Chief Development Officer Jacqueline Reses will resign from Alibaba's board upon the listing, while SoftBank will have the right to nominate just a single director to a new, nine-member board.Alibaba's decision to list in the United States was a blow to the Hong Kong stock exchange, which was initially its preferred IPO venue, but the city's regulators balked at any potential violation of the ""one-share-one-vote principle.""Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank , Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, and Morgan Stanley will underwrite the Alibaba IPO.($1 = 6.2257 Chinese Yuan)   (Additional reporting by Gerry Shih, Sarah McBride, Deepa Seetharaman and Nicola Leske in New York and Elzio Barreto in Hong Kong; Writing by Edwin Chan; Editing by Alden Bentley, Andrew Hay and Ian Geoghegan)",2014-05-07,FB,"Wed May 7, 2014 | 2:09am EDT",UPDATE 4-China's Alibaba files in U.S. for what may be biggest tech IPO,http://www.reuters.com//article/alibaba-ipo-idUSL2N0NS1YA20140507?type=companyNews
249,"   By Dan Levine | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO A U.S. appeals court on Thursday dismissed federal wiretap claims against Facebook Inc and Zynga Inc in a civil lawsuit over disclosure of user information to advertisers.In a separate ruling, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals also revived breach of contract claims under state law against Facebook over the information disclosures.Representatives for Facebook and Zynga could not immediately be reached for comment.Users of Facebook and Zynga filed separate class action lawsuits against the companies in 2010 that have been consolidated on appeal. The plaintiffs claimed that when they clicked on a Zynga game or a Facebook ad, advertisers and other third parties received their Facebook IDs and Facebook page address, court filings show.In its opinion on Thursday, a unanimous three-judge 9th Circuit panel ruled that the plaintiffs could not bring civil wiretap claims against the two companies because the information allegedly disclosed to advertisers did not qualify as the ""contents of a communication"" under the law. However, plaintiffs can pursue allegations that the information disclosure violated Facebook privacy policies which all users are required to endorse, the court ruled. The 9th Circuit issued that part of its ruling in a separate opinion that cannot be cited as precedent in other cases.Kassra Nassiri, an attorney for plaintiffs suing Facebook, said the social media network's trove of user information is key to how it makes money. ""Now we're going to get our chance to show exactly why Facebook breached its privacy policy, and what the value was to Facebook,"" Nassiri said.Similar state law claims against Zynga were not before the 9th Circuit, according to the opinion. An attorney for the Zynga plaintiffs could not immediately be reached.The cases in the 9th Circuit are In re: Facebook Privacy Litigation, case number 12-15619, and In re: Zynga Privacy Litigation, case number 11-18044.(Reporting by Dan Levine; Editing by Franklin Paul and Richard Chang)",2014-05-08,FB,"Thu May 8, 2014 | 1:19pm EDT","Wiretap claims fail against Facebook, Zynga in disclosure lawsuit",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-facebook-zynga-ruling-idUSBREA470P020140508?type=companyNews

251,"  (Adds comments by FCC Commissioner Clyburn, background; paragraphs 4-5, 13-17)By Alina SelyukhWASHINGTON May 7 More than 100 technology companies, including Google Inc, Facebook Inc, Twitter Inc and Amazon.com Inc, have written to U.S. telecom regulators to oppose a new ""net neutrality"" plan that would regulate how Internet providers manage Web traffic.The letter to Federal Communications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler and the agency's four commissioners, warning of a ""grave threat to the Internet,"" came as one FCC commissioner called for a delay of a vote on the plan scheduled for May 15.""Rushing headlong into a rulemaking next week fails to respect the public response to his (Wheeler's) proposal,"" Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel said on Wednesday in remarks prepared for delivery at an industry meeting. She called for a delay of the vote to formally propose Wheeler's plan by ""at least a month.""Wheeler has been under fire for proposing new so-called ""open Internet"" or ""net neutrality"" rules that would allow content companies to pay broadband providers for faster Internet speeds delivering their traffic as long as the deals are deemed ""commercially reasonable.""Consumer advocates are worried the rules would ultimately allow Internet companies such as Comcast Corp or Verizon Communications Inc to create ""fast lanes"" on the Web for traffic of content companies that pay up, potentially shutting out poorer newcomers. The latest to weigh in is the consortium of technology and Internet companies, which ranged from household names to small startups. They called on the FCC to ""take the necessary steps to ensure that the Internet remains an open platform for speech and commerce.""Commission rules should not permit ""individualized bargaining and discrimination,"" the companies said.Engine Advocacy and New America's Open Technology Institute, long-time supporters of Open Internet policies, helped organize the effort. FCC spokesman Neil Grace said Wheeler does not plan to delay the May 15 vote. Though Wheeler has written and spokes about his proposal, the proposed rules have not been made public in full.""Moving forward will allow the American people to review and comment on the proposed plan without delay, and bring us one step closer to putting rules on the books to protect consumers and entrepreneurs online,"" Grace said in a statement.Tens of thousands of public comments have been received by the FCC on Wheeler's plan over the past two weeks, and commission staff has met with nearly 100 stakeholders, including public interest groups and Internet content providers. With two Republican commissioners broadly opposed to  regulation of Internet traffic, the support of two Democrats on the panel - Rosenworcel and Mignon Clyburn - is critical for Wheeler's proposal to pass.""I am listening to your voices as I approach this critical vote to preserve an ever-free and open Internet. ... My mind remains open as I continue to evaluate how best to promote these fundamental, core values,"" Clyburn said, reiterating her opposition to pay-for-priority arrangements.To read Rosenworcel's comments, go to bit.ly/1uC4JHuTo read Clyburn's comments, go to fcc.us/1s4ukENA handful of protesters gathered in the rain in front of the FCC headquarters in Washington on Wednesday afternoon, vowing to show up daily until the May 15 vote, when a high-profile demonstration is expected.Consumer advocates have long urged the FCC to reclassify Internet service providers as more highly regulated utilities, like the telecom companies, a view that has faced staunch opposition from Republican lawmakers and broadband companies.

252,"   By Alexei Oreskovic | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Internet entrepreneurs made their television debut in April with the fictionalized comedy series Silicon Valley. Now start-up entrepreneurs are getting a self-help TV show in which aspiring tech moguls can call in anonymously and get advice from experienced industry players. The new weekly television program, called FounderLine, will fill a void for the growing ranks of tech start-up company founders, said Joe Beninato, a serial tech entrepreneur who created and is hosting the show. The program is modeled after the long-running radio show Loveline, in which callers solicit on-air romantic advice from the show hosts. Instead of fielding questions about infidelity or mysterious rashes though, Beninato said he expects to discuss topics such as problems raising money and whether a founder can be forced out of his own company. Startup founders have lots of burning questions, but they’re often embarrassed or unwilling to ask a board member or investor, he said.  “It’s a bit of an awkward situation,” said Beninato. “You don’t want to show weakness.”The weekly one-hour program will be produced and aired on a local community cable TV channel in Mountain View, California, the Silicon Valley town where Google Inc has its headquarters. But Beninato said he expects most of the show’s audience to watch online, with episodes streamed live as well as posted to sites such as YouTube.  The show’s first episode on Thursday is airing as the Internet industry has become a subject of fascination and envy. The HBO show Silicon Valley paints a humorous portrait of life chasing the dream of Internet riches; in the real world, eye-popping deals such as Facebook Inc’s $19 billion acquisition of messaging app WhatsApp, have reinforced the perception of a modern-day gold rush where anyone can strike it rich.“One guy suggested I should do it five days a week and turn it into a media property, just because entrepreneurship is so hot right now, everybody wants to do a start-up or be a founder,” Beninato said. Still, he acknowledged that it remains to be seen how big of an audience will tune in to hear discussions about the merits of convertible debt versus equity.  One thing that’s not in short supply is the list of experts eager to dole out advice. Among those slated to appear on the show to answer questions are venture capitalists John Lilly and David Hornik, Geek Squad founder Robert Stephens, and Saar Gur, a venture capitalist who co-founded online video ad network company BrightRoll.

254,"  (In 16th paragraph, corrects Apple CEO's last name to Cook instead of Cooks)By Nadia Damouni, Christina  Farr and Nicola LeskeSAN FRANCISCO May 8 Apple Inc is close to paying a record $3.2 billion for Beats Electronics, two people with knowledge of the matter said, an expensive foray into music streaming and headphone gear that would mark a departure for the usually cash-conservative iPhone maker.Both companies are hashing out details and the envisioned deal could still fall through, one person told Reuters on condition of anonymity because the discussions were private.A second source familiar with the matter told Reuters that Apple was in the market for a subscription-based music service to complement its ""iRadio"" ad-based offering, launched in 2013 as part of an attempt to jump into a music-streaming arena then split between a handful of startups such as Pandora Inc.Founded by rapper Dr. Dre and legendary music producer Jimmy Iovine, Beats Electronics is best known for its ""Beats by Dr Dre"" line of trendy headphones that vie with the likes of Skullcandy Inc, Sennheiser Electronic and Bose Corp. This year, it launched a music service that has won plaudits for its slick design and human music curation, versus the computer-algorithms that determine playlists for most of its rivals.But analysts on Thursday questioned whether Beats, valued at just $1 billion during its last funding round in September, was worth that price. Apple had more than $130 billion in cash as of the end of March, but the vast majority of that is parked abroad and investors have called on the company to return more cash in the form of dividends and buybacks.Apple-watchers have speculated that the company that upended the music industry - and today is the single largest seller of tunes - was contemplating a Spotify-like on-demand music service to go with iRadio service and iTunes. ""This is really puzzling,"" said Forrester analyst James McQuivey, who said there was huge overlap between the two companies' customer base. ""You buy companies today to get technologies that no one else  or customers that no one has.""""They must have something hidden  under the hood,"" he said.In two of the largest deals this year, Facebook paid $19 billion for WhatsApp and its half-billion users, and it paid $2 billion for Oculus VR and its cutting-edge virtual reality headset.Apple declined to comment on the report. Beats Electronics did not respond to requests for comment on the news, which was reported first by the Financial Times. UNDER PRESSURE? Apple has not made a billion-dollar acquisition in at least a decade. The company prefers to develop and design its products in-house, though it has tended to pay several hundred million dollars for small but important bits of technology to propel its core consumer electronics business, such as the acquisition of PA Semi in 2008 that led to the processor now found in all iPhones.The company has been under pressure to try to revitalize growth as iPhone sales slow in a rapidly maturing market. Critics have also accused the company of slowly ""losing its cool"" and innovative edge to new and upcoming technology companies, and missing the music-streaming bandwagon. Technology giants Google and Amazon began jockeying for position in music last year, looking at ways to make streaming profitable and to develop a service seen as crucial to retaining users in an increasingly mobile environment. For Google and Apple especially, the endeavor was critical to ensure users remain loyal to their mobile products.They realized they had to stake out a place or risk ceding control of one of the largest components of mobile device usage. Analysts estimate roughly half of smartphone users listen to music on their device, making it the fourth most popular media-related activity after social networking, games and news.Apple launched its own streaming music service last year, hoping to jump into the fast-expanding arena as growth of its iTunes service falters.Apple's Chief Executive Tim Cook met with Iovine, the Beats CEO, last year on a potential partnership involving Beats's planned music-streaming service, Reuters reported in March, citing sources. (r.reuters.com/ter29v)Dre - who guided the careers of a string of rap artists such as Eminem and 50 Cent - compared his company with Apple in 2011.""We're trying to eventually be second to Apple. And I don't think that's a bad position,"" Dre told The Fader music website.(r.reuters.com/cur29v)Beats Electronics received a $500 million investment from Carlyle Group in September that valued the company at over $1 billion. It also bought back in September a 24.84 percent stake held by Taiwan smartphone maker HTC Corp , which once held as much as 50.1 percent of the company.

263,"  (Fixes typo in paragraph 4)By Alexei OreskovicSAN FRANCISCO May 22 Facebook Inc has changed a privacy setting on its social network, limiting the audience that sees new users' first posts in a reversal of a feature that had critics said forced people to over-share personal information.The company said on Thursday that the status updates that new users post will now be viewable only to friends by default, instead of being viewable to the general public as it had previously been. Facebook users will continue to be able to customize their settings so that status updates can be seen by as big or small an audience as they want. The change to the default setting, which Facebook quietly implemented a few weeks ago, is the result of feedback from users, Mike Nowak, a Facebook product manager, said in an interview with Reuters.""Sometimes  people have felt that they've been unpleasantly surprised that their information was more public than they expected or intended,"" he said. ""The feedback that we received is that oversharing is worse than undersharing."" The move reflects a changing approach by Facebook in how it handles the information that people share on its social network of 1.28 billion users.In 2009, Facebook introduced a feature that allowed users to share posts beyond their circles of friends. When new users signed up for Facebook, their status updates were automatically broadcast to the general public unless users manually altered the setting. Thursday's reversal comes as many Internet users appear interested in limiting who sees their online activities. Mobile messaging and social networking apps such as Snapchat and Whisper offer anonymity features that have become popular with many users. In February, Facebook announced plans to acquire WhatsApp, a private messaging app, for $19 billion.Facebook said on Thursday that it will now display a pop-up message informing new users of the option to publish the message more broadly if they wish.Facebook will also begin showing all of its users a new ""privacy checkup"" feature that walks through certain privacy settings, such as who can see personal profile information and which third-party apps users are connected to.

264,"  (Repeats for additional subscribers)By David RandallNEW YORK May 22 When the nine-person startup he co-founded was bought by Facebook for a reported $15 million in January, Cemre Gungor, 27, was inundated with phone calls and emails from wealth advisers. Yet he spurned them all, opting instead to open an account with Betterment, an online financial adviser launched in 2010 that automatically invests in a portfolio of exchange traded funds based mainly on a client's age.""My personality doesn't lend itself to being the sort of person who would research good wealth managers and then trust them with making decisions. I don't want to spend any time thinking or caring about that,"" said Gungor, who grew up in Turkey and Finland before moving to the U.S.He and others of his generation are posing a challenge for wealth advisers who are streaming into Silicon Valley and San Francisco after the public stock offerings of companies such as Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter helped California create more millionaires than any other U.S. state since 2009.But even as traditional financial firms battle for office space and seek out new customers, they're finding that the pickings aren't easy. The youngest winners of the thriving tech economy, many of whom came of age during the last financial crisis, aren't often interested in the ideas that attracted clients in the past. Nor are they fans of the old-school model of letting a financial planner make decisions with minimal client input.In response, traditional advisers are changing the way they practice. They're finding that young clients need help with lifestyle issues ranging from how to give money away to how to deal with old friends who are jealous of a sudden tech windfall. And they are giving clients more of the hard data behind their decisions than they might with clients who inherited their fortunes or built them up over time.Debra Wetherby, an independent adviser whose Wetherby Asset Management manages about $3.6 billion in assets, has fielded questions from young, single workers about when and how to tell potential spouses about their fortunes. Christine Leong Connors, who heads JPMorgan's Palo Alto office, has talked with tech clients about how to donate money effectively when their own net worth is larger than the charity they are giving to. And Michael Williams, a UBS Wealth Management Americas branch manager in San Francisco, has found himself courting potential clients whose paydays are so far away that they're still pulling all-nighters and sometimes sleeping in their startup offices.It's all part of an attempt to appeal to a new demographic of money. The youngest members of Generation X and millennials are the most likely to say that they are dissatisfied with their wealth adviser, according to a report by the Spectrem Group, a market research company in Lake Forest, Illinois.""The industry is not in alignment with folks who are very tech savvy, and it's an industry that is trying to catch up,"" said George Walper Jr., the president of Spectrem. CALIFORNIA MONEY Nowhere is the collision between new money and the old-line business of wealth management more on display than in California. Firms like Barclays, Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Bank of America Corp's Merrill Lynch and JPMorgan Chase & Co have all expanded their Bay Area operations as firms like Facebook have gone public and the shares of more mature firms like Google have hit all-time highs.In the three years since JPMorgan opened an office in Palo Alto, the heart of Silicon Valley, its headcount has swelled to 30 advisers from six. When combined with its sister office in San Francisco, its number of advisers in Northern California has grown by 50 percent, to 110 people, since 2012.The firm created separate teams based on how clients have built their wealth, said Jeremy Geller, the head of JPMorgan's Private Bank business in Northern California. Unlike other teams which may be more focused on investment ideas, the tech-centered team works on anticipating the personal financial consequences of one-time events such as a startup getting another round of funding, going public or selling the business altogether. Advisers discuss with young clients such issues as when to start selling a personal stake in a business, Geller said. ADVISERS TRY TO ADAPT Advisers say they are working to adapt to the needs of tech workers who are skeptical that the wealth management industry offers much value.Wetherby, 56, the independent adviser, finds herself having more conversations with clients who are unsure of how to handle their newfound fortunes at a time when income inequality is a larger part of the national conversation.""For many of them, this is something that's private and new and separates them from their existing social group,"" said Wetherby. ""It's a big adjustment and so a lot of them are trying to be quieter about it.""She also appeals to new clients by promoting so-called social impact investing, which tries to make money while also doing some social good such as buying shares in a company in the clean water business. Darell Krasnoff, a partner at Los Angeles-based Bel Air Investment Advisors who plans to open a San Francisco office for the firm by the end of the year, said that the approach he takes with wealthy tech clients is similar regardless of their ages. He has won new clients like Kamran Pourzanjani, he said, by creating data-heavy custom reports that appeal to tech workers more comfortable with the language of numbers.After the firm he co-founded, PriceGrabber.com, was acquired for about $500 million in 2005, Pourzanjani, 54, spent 8 years bouncing between financial advisers who did not present enough data to convince him. He eventually signed on with Bel Air, in part because Krasnoff was able to provide custom spreadsheets that allowed him to have faith that Krasnoff's plans were solid.The idea of trusting a financial adviser with his wealth after spending years as an entrepreneur making all of his own decisions was a ""giant leap,"" Pourzanjani said. ""That's definitely a struggle for a lot of people"" in the tech industry, he said.NEW COMPETITORS Wealthfront, a private company that has received funding from DAG Ventures and other venture capital firms, represents the other end of the spectrum of personalized advice. The company counts Burton Malkiel, a Princeton professor whose book ""A Random Walk Down Wall Street"" helped popularize passive investing, as its chief investment officer, a role that chiefly focuses on evaluating asset classes and allocation strategies that underpin the firm's automated process.About 60 percent of its clients are under the age of 35, and it charges a fee of 25 cents per $100 invested for its services, and levies no fees at all for accounts under $10,000.Both Wealthfront, and its competitor Betterment, are heavily courting young workers whose memories of the financial crisis make them skeptical that anyone can have insights into where the stock market is headed. So far, that message has been resonating with its clients.""Unless you're at the stage and scope that you need to be playing crazy tax games, it doesn't make sense to talk to a wealth manager,"" said a young Stanford business school graduate whose company was acquired by a large technology company last year. He didn't want to use his last name because he didn't want to draw attention to himself.Adam Nash, Wealthfront's chief executive, used to work at both LinkedIn and eBay and said that his clients are mostly found in San Francisco, New York, and other places where ""young people are able to make money.""They tend to put more trust in technology than in people, Nash said. ""They don't really believe that a person is going to be watching their money 24/7, but they believe that a computer is,"" he said.      (Reporting by David Randall.

266,"  (Repeats to further subscribers without changes)DUBAI May 27 A conservative Iranian court opened a case against instant messaging services WhatsApp and Instagram while also summoning Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg over complaints of privacy violation, state news agency ISNA reported on Tuesday.The case underscores the growing struggle between moderate Iranian president Hassan Rouhani's drive to increase Internet freedoms and demands by the conservative judiciary for tighter controls.The Iranian court in the southern province of Fars opened the cases against the social networks after citizens complained of breaches of privacy. ""According to the court's ruling, the Zionist director of the company of Facebook, or his official attorney must appear in court to defend himself and pay for possible losses,"" said Ruhollah Momen-Nasab, an Iranian internet official, according to state news agency ISNA, referring to Zuckerberg's Jewish background.Zuckerberg, whose company owns WhatsApp and Instagram, is unlikely to heed the summons.

273,"  * Appointed advisers include former generals close to palace* Scores detained since coup on May 22* Night-time curfew shortened* Factory output dropped for 13th month in April* Imports slump, exports weak   (Updates with Facebook temporarily inaccessible, activists freed)By Pracha HariraksapitakBANGKOK, May 28 Thailand's junta has appointed two retired generals with palace connections as advisers, putting powerful establishment figures hostile towards former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra firmly in the ascendant in the country's long-running power struggle.Hoping to show things are getting back to normal, the military also relaxed a night-time curfew brought in after it seized power in a May 22 coup, and is expected to speed up efforts to get the economy moving again after months of debilitating political protests.Data on Wednesday showed trade shrank in April and factory output fell for a 13th straight month, underscoring the damage political unrest has caused and the tough job the military government faces reviving an economy on the brink of recession.The Information Technology Ministry said it had blocked Facebook at the request of the military to stem protests. But the site was back up after about 30 minutes and the military denied involvement, saying a technical problem was to blame.The military has issued warnings about the spread of what it considers provocative material on social media.The junta's team of advisers includes a former defence minister, General Prawit Wongsuwan, and former army chief General Anupong Paochinda.The two men are towering figures in Thailand's military establishment and have close ties to coup leader General Prayuth Chan-ocha. All three are staunch monarchists and helped oust Thaksin, who remains at the heart of the political crisis, in a 2006 coup.A Reuters report in December revealed that Prawit and Anupong had secretly backed the anti-government protests that undermined the government of Thaksin's sister, Yingluck Shinawatra. She was removed by a court on May 7 for abuse of power and the coup ousted remaining ministers two weeks later. It is not clear what powers the advisers will have, but their appointment would suggest little prospect of compromise with the Shinawatras.SOME DETAINEES RELEASED The military has sought to stifle opposition to its power grab, detaining scores of politicians and activists and imposing censorship on the media.Deputy army spokesman Winthai Suvaree said 200 people summoned after the coup had been detained but 124 of them had since been released. Seventy-six were still being held, while another 53 people had not responded to a summons.Later, the army released at least 10 pro-Thaksin ""red-shirt"" activists including their leader, Jatuporn Prompan.Yingluck and Suthep Thaugsuban, a former deputy prime minister in a rival government who led six months of protests against her, are among those who have been released.Some pro-Thaksin activists have also been detained in the provinces, such as Chiang Mai in the north, the Shinawatras' hometown and a hotbed of support, activists say. Deputy army spokesman Winthai Suvaree said the army might soon release leaders of red-shirt activists, such as Jatuporn Prompan.""Those released must tell us where they live and where they plan to travel,"" Winthai said. ""If they violate these rules they'll be invited to meet us.""People being released are asked to sign a document saying they will not organise rallies, he said.There have been daily, peaceful protests against the coup in Bangkok although the number of protesters dwindled to about 200 on Wednesday from about 1,000 on Sunday.A seven-hour curfew the army imposed after the coup has been shortened to four hours, from midnight.ECONOMY IN DOLDRUMS The junta's new advisers also include Pridiyathorn Devakula, overseeing the economy. A former central banker, he was finance minister in an interim government after the 2006 coup, when strict capital controls were introduced to hold down the baht, causing the stock market to tumble 15 percent in one day. Highlighting the task ahead, factory output fell 3.9 percent in April from a year earlier, the 13th monthly drop in a row.The Commerce Ministry reported another slump in imports, down 14.5 percent in April from a year before as companies, unsure how the politics would develop, stopped importing machinery and consumers reined in spending.Exports have not been able to offset the depression in the domestic economy: they fell 0.9 percent in April, although the ministry said it was hopeful for 5 percent export growth this year.Thailand's gross domestic product shrank 2.1 percent in the first quarter of 2014 as the anti-government protesters harassed ministries, damaged confidence and scared off tourists.The military has moved quickly to tackle economic problems, notably preparing payments for hundreds of thousands of rice farmers that the ousted government was unable to make.Some economists think the outlook could improve under the military, with the rice payments that will allow farmers to start spending again and a vow that a new budget will be on time and new investment plans all boding well.NO ELECTION TIMETABLE, U.S. CONCERNED General Prayuth has not set any timetable for elections, saying broad reforms were needed first.That may further complicate relations with foreign governments that have called for a speedy return to democracy, an end to censorship and the release of politicians, protest leaders, journalists and others detained.""We're going to have to continue to calibrate how we'll work with the government and military when they don't show any pathway back to civilian rule,"" a senior U.S. official told Reuters in Washington. ""We're very concerned and there will be an impact on our relationship.""Thaksin has not commented on the coup except to say he was saddened and hoped the military would treat everyone fairly.The Shinawatras' strength is in the north and northeast, populous, mostly rural regions that have won them every election since 2001. Some Thaksin loyalists had vowed to resist a coup and the army and police are hunting for weapons.Many Bangkok voters support the establishment and approve of the coup if it means ending Thaksin's influence. They say he is corrupt and disrespectful to the monarchy, an accusation he denies.   (Additional reporting by Amy Sawitta Lefevre,  Orathai Sriring, Manunphattr Dhanananphorn in Bangkok, Andrew R.C.

278,"  DUBAI The attorney general of the Iranian province of Fars on Wednesday denied a report that a local court had summoned Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg over privacy violations, despite complaints having been filed by some individuals.Iranian state news agency ISNA reported on Tuesday that a conservative court had opened a case against instant messaging services WhatsApp and Instagram while also summoning Zuckerberg over the complaints.""Reports regarding the summoning of Zuckerberg, the CEO of Facebook, by a court in Fars are completely false,"" the attorney general, Ali Alghasi-Mehr, said according to official state IRNA.""But there are complaints by specific people over Facebook regarding the printing of certain videos and films,"" he added.ISNA on Tuesday quoted Ruhollah Momen-Nasab, an Iranian internet official, as saying that the court in southern Fars province had opened the cases against the social networks after citizens complained of breaches of privacy. ""According to the court's ruling, the Zionist director of the company of Facebook, or his official attorney must appear in court to defend himself and pay for possible losses,"" ISNA quoted Momen-Nasab as saying, referring to Zuckerberg's Jewish background.Most recently a Facebook campaign called ""My Stealthy Freedom"" where women in Iran can upload pictures of themselves without the mandatory hijab has garnered significant attention, with over 380,000 likes. A website has been created in response to the first entitled ""Iranian Women's Real Freedom.""  An escalating struggle is underway between moderate President Hassan Rouhani's drive to increase Internet freedoms and demands by the conservative judiciary for tighter controls.    Iran is still under international sanctions over its disputed nuclear activities and it is difficult for U.S. citizens to secure travel visas, even if they want to visit.Internet use is high in Iran, partly because many young Iranians turn to it to bypass an official ban on Western cultural products, and Tehran occasionally filters popular websites such as Twitter and Facebook. Rouhani, in remarks that challenge hardliners who have stepped up measures to censor the Web, said earlier this month that Iran should embrace the Internet rather than see it as a threat.    A Rouhani administration official said Iran would loosen Internet censorship by introducing ""smart filtering"", which only keeps out sites the Islamic government considers immoral.

279,"   By Victoria Cavaliere  Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg's gift of $120 million to the San Francisco Bay Area public school system on Friday marks his second attempt at putting huge sums of his own money into turning around failing schools.This time, he can only hope to come under less criticism.      Four years ago, Zuckerberg donated $100 million to reform the chronically ailing Newark, New Jersey, school system, appearing on the ""Oprah Winfrey Show"" to announce a gift he hoped would turn that city's schools into an example of educational excellence nationwide.Today, with almost all the funds spent, critics say his efforts in Newark have been misdirected, with much of the money going to programs that have minimal long-term benefit.""The whole Newark thing was the big celebrity event - dump the money, then go back to the other coast,"" said Bruce Baker, a professor in the Graduate School of Education at Rutgers, in New Jersey. Zuckerberg said on Friday in a San Jose Mercury News essay written with his wife, Priscilla Chan, that he has ""learned a lot about what makes a successful effort"" but that it was also too early to determine the impact of the Newark initiative. Education experts say the Bay Area funds appear better targeted than in Newark, where most of the $100 million donated four years ago has been spent without major improvements in student scores. Reforms there have prompted protests and criticism that the bulk of the donated funds went for teacher contracts and charter schools, creating what detractors say are financially unsustainable obligations for the school system. In the Bay Area, the money appears to be targeted differently. Zuckerberg said much of it, at least to start, would be used to upgrade technology and train educators.""The initial grants will go toward initiatives that provide computers and connectivity in schools, as well as teacher training and parent outreach to make these a really valuable addition to the learning experience,"" he wrote.The Newark and Bay Area schools appear equally in need.Newark's schools suffered so much from low test scores and falling enrollment that in 1995 a judge ordered the state to take control. Since then, more than a dozen schools have been closed, and students in the poorest districts use classrooms with crumbling ceilings and peeling walls.  Zuckerberg's latest donation will initially be spent in three school districts - San Francisco, Redwood City and Ravenswood City - which serve nearly 70,000 students, with more than 80 percent receiving free or discounted school meals. The average student in Ravenswood district is outperformed by about 80 percent of students nationwide, according to comparative data compiled by the George W. Bush Institute.Will Hodges, a spokesman for the Bay Area project said Zuckerberg's team learned from the Newark project, which remained a ""work in progress.""""The most important thing they've learned is to bring in the local community to be involved with their work, to focus on the community's needs,"" Hodges said.In Newark, the money has mostly been spent. While graduation rates have risen to 67 percent in 2013, from 54 percent in 2009, tests scores in reading and math have hardly budged, according to the state Department of Education. Critics say the money could have been put to better use. For example, it could have been used to pay for infrastructure or transportation or even to set up an endowment to generate annual returns.Out of $83 million spent, $31 million went for retroactive teacher pay and $17.5 million towards a new teacher contract pegged to student performance. Experts say there is no funding in place to continue to subsidize the merit pay system once the Facebook cash is gone.Newark residents and education experts also question the hiring of expensive consultants, some of whom charge $1,000 a day.The foundation says more than $4 million has gone directly toward creating new charter schools, allowing students to choose where they want to attend class.But with thousands of students now able to go to a school miles from home, Newark officials have scrambled to provide busing, a potentially great cost for a city facing a $93 million budget shortfall. ""Can you fathom it? Putting a 5 or 6-year-old child on a public bus in Newark?"" said Frank Adao, president of the Newark Parents Union, whose son is a 6th grader.

The two noted that low-income and minority students in the region struggle to perform well in the classroom, due in part to a lack of school resources.

285,"  BEIJING Chinese state media lashed out at Google Inc GOOGL.O, Apple Inc AAPL.O and other U.S. technology companies on Wednesday, calling on Beijing ""to punish severely the pawns"" of the U.S. government for monitoring China and stealing secrets.U.S. companies such as Yahoo Inc YHOO.O, Cisco Systems Inc CSCO.O, Microsoft Corp MSFT.O and Facebook Inc FB.O threaten the cyber-security of China and its Internet users, said the People's Daily on its microblog, in comments echoed on the front page of the English-language China Daily.It is not clear what sparked this latest round of vitriol, nor what information the U.S. firms are alleged to have stolen. But Chinese media have repeatedly attacked American tech companies for aiding the U.S. government's cyber espionage since U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) contractor Edward Snowden revealed widespread spying programs including PRISM.Under PRISM, the NSA seized data from companies such as Google and Apple, according to revelations made by Snowden a year ago.Chinese state-owned firms have since begun dispensing with the services of U.S. companies such as IBM Corp IBM.N, Oracle Corp ORCL.N and Cisco in favor of domestic technology. As a result, Snowden's revelations may cost U.S. companies billions of dollars, analysts say.""U.S. companies including Apple, Microsoft, Google, Facebook, etc. are all coordinating with the PRISM program to monitor China,"" the People's Daily said on its official microblog.""To resist the naked Internet hegemony, we will draw up international regulations, and strengthen technology safeguards, but we will also severely punish the pawns of the villain. The priority is strengthening penalties and punishments, and for anyone who steals our information, even though they are far away, we shall punish them!"" it said.Google has already had problems in China this week. On Monday, a China censorship watchdog said Google services were being disrupted ahead of Wednesday's 25th anniversary of the 1989 crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators around Beijing's Tiananmen Square. (Full Story) ""We cannot say this more clearly - the (U.S.) government does not have access to Google servers - not directly, or via a back door, or a so-called drop box,"" said Google Chief Legal Officer David Drummond in an emailed statement on Wednesday. ""We provide user data to governments only in accordance with the law.""Microsoft declined to provide immediate comment. Facebook, Yahoo and Cisco were not immediately available when Reuters sought comment. All of them have previously denied participating in sweeping surveillance efforts.Apple on Wednesday referred to its previous statements on the matter.""Much of what has been said isn't true. There is no back door. The government doesn't have access to our servers. They would have to cart us out in a box for that,"" Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said in an April interview with ABC Television. ROCKY TIME Facebook is currently blocked by Chinese censors but said last month it may open a sales office in China to provide more support to local advertisers who use the website to reach customers overseas. (Full Story)In December, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Facebook, Yahoo and other Internet companies issued an open letter to U.S. President Barack Obama and Congress to reform and introduce restrictions on surveillance activities. (Full Story) Even so, U.S. tech companies have had a rocky time in China since the NSA revelations. Just last month, central government offices were banned from installing Windows 8, Microsoft's latest operating system, on new computers. (Full Story)But the U.S. has responded with its own measures. In May, the U.S. Department of Justice charged five Chinese military officers with hacking U.S. companies to steal trade secrets.The indictment sparked outrage in China and added urgency to Beijing's efforts to promote the development of local information technology (IT) companies.Chinese media called the United States ""a high-level hooligan"" and officials accused Washington of applying ""double standards"" on issues of cyber spying.After the charges were announced, China said it will investigate providers of important IT products and services to protect ""national security"" and ""economic and social development.""

291,"   By Svea Herbst-Bayliss | BOSTON, June 6  BOSTON, June 6 Sureview Capital, a small hedge fund which received starting capital from one of the industry's most powerful investors, Blackstone Group, shut down last month, people familiar with the matter said on Friday.The fund was founded by John Wu with seed money from Blackstone Alternative Asset Management in 2011 and last reported assets of $427 million on a regulatory filing.At the end of the first quarter Sureview, which specialized in picking stocks, listed CBS Corp as its biggest position and said it owned shares in Yahoo Inc and Facebook Inc, all of which suffered losses in March and early April. Sureview, based in Greenwich, Connecticut, did not respond to phone calls seeking comment. The industry sources requested anonymity because hedge funds are private.When it launched, Sureview was viewed as a potential new heavy hitter in the $2.7 trillion industry, not only because of Wu's resume, which included working at Kingdon Capital and Tiger Management before that, but more importantly because of Blackstone's seal of approval. Considered one of the industry's savviest investors, Blackstone invests roughly $55 billion in hedge funds and has raised more than $2 billion for its two so-called seeding funds, which help get new fund managers started. Competition for a piece of those assets, usually distributed in $100 million to $150 million chunks, was fierce, fund managers familiar with the selection process have said. Blackstone has seeded fewer than 20 new hedge fund managers.Industry analysts have said it is generally expected that not every manager in a seeding fund will mature and that some will shut down. Wu had a tough start in 2011 but returns were strong in 2013. This year, the fund struggled during the first quarter,  the people familiar with the fund and its performance said.Running a hedge fund has been especially difficult recently with the industry's performance paling in comparison to the broader stock market.Hedge funds lost money in April and March, and are up only 1.71 percent in the first five months of this year, according to data from Hedge Fund Research.

While ministers also agreed on provisions allowing companies to transfer data to countries outside the European Union, there was no decision on how to help companies avoid having to deal separately with the bloc's 28 different data protection authorities.That issue was thrown into stark relief by a ruling from Europe's top court requiring Google to remove links to a 16-year-old newspaper article about a Spanish man's bankruptcy. [ID: nL6N0NZ25S]The search engine has since received tens of thousands of requests across Europe, and under current rules has to deal with each national authority.A 'one-stop-shop' arrangement would allow companies to deal exclusively with the data protection authority in the country where it has its main establishment. But governments are concerned about a foreign data protection authority making binding decisions that they would then have to enforce.For example, if a complaint originated in Denmark against a company based in Ireland, the Danish authorities would have to implement a decision by the Irish data protection body, something that is both legally and politically difficult.

294,"   By Deepa Seetharaman and Alexei Oreskovic | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO David Marcus, who has led eBay Inc's fast-growing payments unit PayPal for the past two years, will step down this month to run Facebook Inc's messaging products, the companies announced on Monday.EBay shares fell a little more than 2 percent in trading after hours. Under Marcus, PayPal has moved more aggressively into the physical world by developing a mobile wallet for consumers as well as point-of-sale systems for retailers.The move marks Facebook's latest effort to bolster its private messaging features as it faces competition from a new crop of popular mobile messaging services such as Snapchat and Line. In February, Facebook stunned observers by announcing plans to acquire messaging service WhatsApp for $19 billion. In the newly created role of Vice President of Messaging Products, Marcus will oversee the Messenger service within Facebook's social network as well as the free Messenger mobile app, said Facebook spokeswoman Vanessa Chan. Roughly 12 billion messages are sent every day on Facebook, and the Messenger app has more than 200 million users, according to the company.""I'm looking forward to getting my hands dirty again attempting to build something new and meaningful at scale,"" Marcus said in a post on his LinkedIn page on Monday.  The move comes as PayPal, which has 148 million active users, faces tougher global competition from Amazon.com Inc, which launched a recurring payments program earlier on Monday, as well as Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holdings Ltd, which is going public later this year.  In a blog post, eBay Chief Executive John Donahoe said Marcus was leaving behind a strong leadership team and PayPal was on track to meet its outlook for 2015.

300,"   By Jonathan Kaminsky  An Alabama woman was charged for trying to enlist a Facebook friend, who in fact was her aunt posing as a man, to kill her family, police and prosecutors said on Wednesday.Marissa Williams, 19, faces 10 years to life in prison if convicted on one count of solicitation for murder, a class-A felony, for her alleged plot to kill several relatives and even a family pet.Police said Williams had in April moved in with her aunt's family in the western Alabama community of Fosters, where she started to meet men online and invite them to the house.Frustrated by this behavior, her aunt created a Facebook alter ego, Tre 'Topdog' Ellis, to befriend her niece, said Lieutenant Andy Norris, spokesman for the Tuscaloosa County Sheriff's Office. Williams began chatting online with the fictional Ellis late last month, inviting him over and offering to have sex with him in exchange for covering her $50 cellphone bill, Norris said.At one point, she told Ellis that she was sick of her family and asked him to shoot dead her aunt, her aunt's fiancée, Williams' cousin and the family dog and to run away with him, Norris said. Upon reading the request, the aunt contacted the sheriff's office. Williams admitted to police she had asked her Facebook friend for the favor, but said she did not intend to actually have anyone killed, Norris said.Norris said Williams' her approach to enlisting a hitman was not typical. ""Usually they try to get a friend or an acquaintance to do it, someone they can trust,"" he said. ""This isn't normal behavior.""Williams was arrested on Tuesday and is in jail in lieu of posting $30,000 bond. She is due in court later this week, a Tuscaloosa County District Attorney's Office spokesman said, adding there is no record of her yet having retained an attorney.

302,"   By Alexei Oreskovic | SAN FRANCISCO, June 17  SAN FRANCISCO, June 17 Facebook Inc  launched a smartphone app on Tuesday that will allow consumers to exchange disappearing photos and videos without requiring Facebook accounts, the Internet company's latest effort to develop mobile services beyond its core social network.The new app, dubbed Slingshot, allows users to sign up for the service with their mobile phone number and connect with friends in their phone's contact list or, if they want, by finding their Facebook friends.Photos on Slingshot disappear from users' phones shortly after they are viewed, reflecting a growing anxiety about privacy in the age of Internet social networking. Facebook's release of Slingshot comes as a new crop of mobile messaging services gain popularity and threaten to draw younger users away from Facebook's 1.28 billion-user social network.To help mitigate the threat from alternative social networks, Facebook is developing a variety of standalone apps and acquiring fast-growing rivals. In 2012 it acquired photo-sharing service Instagram and in February it announced plans to acquire messaging app WhatsApp for $19 billion. Snapchat, an app that lets users send messages that automatically disappear after a few seconds, turned down a $3 billion acquisition offer from Facebook last year, according to media reports at the time. Unlike other messaging apps, Slingshot will not allow users to view the messages they have received from their friends until they reciprocate and send back a photo or video of their own. The rule is designed to make Slingshot a service for which everyone contributes material, although it could require a learning curve that confuses or turns off some users.""When everyone participates there's less pressure, more creativity and even the little things in life can turn into awesome shared experiences,"" Facebook said in a blog post announcing the service on Tuesday.Slingshot will be available in the United States on Tuesday for Android and iOS devices.

304,"   By Noel Randewich | SAN FRANCISCO, June 18  SAN FRANCISCO, June 18 Intel Corp is taking a new approach to the powerful server chips it sells to Internet heavyweights like Facebook and Google.The Santa Clara, California company is integrating its Xeon processors with programmable chips that will give customers with unique technical requirements more flexibility to optimize their servers.With a stagnant PC industry and little progress in smartphones and tablets, selling high-end server chips is an increasingly important source of profits for Intel.Most servers are made with off-the-shelf Intel Xeon chips, but last year Intel manufactured about 15 customized versions of those processors to meet the particular needs of high-end customers like eBay and Facebook.It plans to manufacture over 30 customized chips this year, Diane Bryant, who leads Intel's data center division, told reporters at a briefing this week. The technology Bryant announced at an event Wednesday goes a step further, letting data center operators customize the chips themselves, as often as they want.Intel dominates the server market but it faces a new source of competition as rivals prepare low-power processors based on technology from ARM Holdings. The new component integrates a standard Xeon processor and a  chip known as a field-programmable gate array, or FPGA. Customers can configure the chips as needed to make servers faster at handling proprietary tasks, like providing web-search results or updating social networks.""If they have an application that spends a lot of time on a particular algorithm, they can take that algorithm, take the soft (intellectual property), and load it into the FPGA and accelerate that workload,"" Bryant said.Intel already sells server products that combine Xeon chips and programmable chips but on the new component they will be much more closely integrated, resulting in up to double the performance, Bryant said. She declined to say when Intel would sell the new product, how much they would cost or what company would supply the programmable chip, a technology distinct from Intel's focus on processors.Programmable chips are typically used by manufacturers making small quantities of products or prototypes that do not warrant the expense of designing a new chip from the ground up. On Wall Street they are used to run complex financial simulations.Microsoft has already been experimenting with using programmable chips to help power its Bing web search engine.Intel announced in March it was expanding its existing contract manufacturing relationship with programmable chipmaker Altera to develop future components that combine different kinds of chips. Bryant said that arrangement was unrelated to the upcoming Xeon offering.

305,"   By Sarah O'Connor | DUBLIN  DUBLIN Ireland's High Court on Wednesday asked the European Court of Justice (ECJ) to review a European Union-U.S. data protection agreement in light of allegations that Facebook FB.O shared data from EU users with the U.S. National Security Agency.It asked the European Court to clarify whether a Safe Harbour deal, which allows the transfer of data from EU consumers to the United States, was compatible with the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.The judge was ruling on a request by Austrian student group europe-v-facebook for an investigation into allegations that companies including Apple AAPL.O and Facebook help the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) harvest email and other private data from European citizens.The group appealed to the High Court after the Irish data watchdog - the effective supervisor of the EU activities of some of the biggest U.S. Internet companies which have their European headquarters in Ireland - had said in July there were no grounds for such an investigation.High Court Justice Gerard Hogan said that given the Safe Harbour agreement, which says that U.S. has sufficient data safeguards in place, the Irish regulator did not have the authority to investigate. If Safe Harbour stands, the student group's application must fail, he said. ""The critical issue which arises is whether the proper interpretation of the 1995 [EU data protection] directive and the 2000 Commission decision [on the Safe Harbour principles] should be re-evaluated in the light of the subsequent entry into force of article 8 of the EU charter,"" on the right to the protection of personal data, Hogan said.The Safe Harbour agreement allows U.S. companies like Facebook, Google GOOGL.O, and Microsoft MSFT.O to gather customer information in Europe and send it to the United States, beyond the EU's legal jurisdiction, as long as certain criteria are met.The strength of the agreement was called into question by the revelation by U.S. intelligence contractor Edward Snowden last year that the NSA used major Web companies, including Apple AAPL.O, Google, Facebook and Microsoft, to gather user data as part of a mass electronic surveillance programme known as Prism. ""The whole Prism, NSA spying thing is thereby in front of the highest court in Europe, which is going to be very interesting,"" Max Schrems, founder of europe-v-facebook, the Austrian lobby group which brought the case, said.""Any ruling will apply to any other U.S. companies that have participated in PRISM,"" he said, adding that he thought there was a ""very good chance"" of having Safe Harbour overturned.EU countries are negotiating a new data protection law which would oblige companies like Google or Facebook to seek consent before using personal information, and would impose stiff fines if they break the rules. ""If Safe Harbour were to come falling down, that would create an immediate issue for the thousands of multinationals who have self-certified with that system,"" Rob Corbet, head of technology and innovation at Arthur Cox law firm in Dublin, said.""However, nobody wants that uncertainty so I think the more likely outcome is that the U.S. and Europe will get their act together and reach a political outcome on data transfers prior to any final ECJ ruling.”A referral from a Spanish court led the European Court last month to rule that internet companies can be made to remove irrelevant or excessive personal information from search engine results in a case that pitted privacy campaigners against Google.

Much of the coast is dominated by Sri Lanka's majority Buddhist Sinhalese community.The group denies any connection with the incidents, in which three people died and 75 were injured.""My account is blocked,"" BBS spokesman Dilantha Vithanage told Reuters by telephone. ""I can't access my account. I last visited my account on June 25 and the accounts of others have also been blocked.""

The social media site's terms and conditions warn users not to ""credibly threaten others or organise acts of real-world violence"" and says it can remove content when it perceives ""a genuine risk of physical harm or a direct threat to public safety"".Facebook also says organisations ""with a record of terrorist of violent criminal activity are not allowed to maintain a presence"". Violence against Muslims in Sri Lanka has risen since 2012, mirroring events in Myanmar, which has seen a surge of attacks by members of the majority Buddhist community on Muslims.Despite requests by many Muslim political leaders in President Mahinda Rajapaksa's coalition government to crack down on the BBS, the authorities have taken no steps.Many independent analysts say well-coordinated violence against Muslims and Christians appears to have tacit state backing as those involved in previous attacks have yet to be punished.

322,"   By John McCrank | NEW YORK, July 1  NEW YORK, July 1 The New York Stock Exchange said it will hold a test run of Alibaba Group Holding's IPO-ALIB.N highly anticipated market debut, reflecting the securities industry's focus on risk controls after a raft of technical snafus in recent years.NYSE, owned by Intercontinental Exchange Inc, said in a note to traders on Tuesday it would allow firms to test their trading software ahead of the initial public offering of Alibaba on July 12 for a listing on the New York Stock Exchange.The Chinese e-commerce company's trading debut this summer could be the largest-ever technology IPO in the U.S., possibly eclipsing Facebook Inc's $15 billion share sale in May 2012. Facebook's trading debut on Nasdaq OMX Group's  exchange was plagued with software problems as massive volumes of orders came in, setting off a chain of events that market-making firms said cost them a combined $500 million. Nasdaq, which was fined $10 million by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over the problems, said it would voluntarily compensate firms that had been harmed up to a total of $62 million.NYSE regularly conducts systems testing during the weekends but it was only last October, ahead of Twitter Inc's  market debut, that it opened up for an IPO simulation requested by member firms, many of which participated in Facebook's IPO. During the Twitter IPO simulation, NYSE was testing mainly for two things: To see if its systems could handle the amount of message traffic that might be generated by the IPO; and to make sure that once the IPO took place any firms that placed orders would promptly receive the reports telling them that their orders had been executed.The Facebook incident was one of a number of high-profile technology-related problems that have roiled markets and weighed on investor confidence in recent years, placing a bigger focus on operational risk by regulators and market participants.

323,"   By Conrad de Aenlle | LONG BEACH Calif.  LONG BEACH Calif. (The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.)Many tech companies saw their high-flying stocks lose altitude this year. Leaders in social media like Twitter Inc. and LinkedIn Corp. fell more than 40 percent from their 2014 highs. Others, such as the retailer Amazon.com Inc., took more modest drops, although shareholders might not have found them modest at the time.These stocks, among others, are cheaper than they were, but are they cheap enough? They almost certainly can't be considered bargains by normal valuation yardsticks. Their price-earnings ratios – when there are earnings – can run close to or into triple digits.Portfolio managers find, however, that some businesses offer sufficient growth potential to warrant bets around current prices. Kevin Landis, manager of the Firsthand Technology Opportunities Fund, has been adding to his position in Twitter, a longtime holding, because he expects the stock to improve over the long haul as the company evolves from an upstart held in tech portfolios into a respectable blue chip that will be far more widely owned.""It's only a matter of time before Twitter goes into the S&P 500,"" says Landis, a Silicon Valley investor since the days of CompuServe email addresses composed of long strings of numbers. ""Like Google 10 years ago or Facebook two years ago, everyone will have to own them.""The reason that Twitter plunged in the first place, losing more than half its value, is that investors pulled back ahead of anticipated selling by corporate insiders. Many feared a massive dumping of Twitter stock once the lock-up period from the company's November initial public offering ended. That has abated, Landis says, and the stock ""really looks like it has found a bottom.""Landis also holds Google Inc. along with Facebook Inc., which has nearly quadruped in value since late 2008, but he's having reservations about the latter. Landis questions how much growth potential Facebook has left and warns that he may sell before the year is out. ""I'm still happy to hold it, but at over $160 billion [in market value], how much can it possibly make in the next 10 years?"" he wonders. ""I don't know that we'll hold it forever.""Landis has no such misgivings about LinkedIn, a social-media company for professionals. He remained invested through the recent plunge and believes that the stock is worth buying today.""We own it and would consider adding to it,"" he says. ""It's a top brand. It's hard to imagine a scenario where LinkedIn fades from view."" The $110 million Firsthand Technology Opportunity is up an annualized 20 percent in the five years through June 27, according to Lipper, a unit of Thomson Reuters. The fund has an expense ratio of 1.85 percent.John Toohey, head of equities for USAA Investments, which offers the $571 million USAA Science & Technology Fund, has similar opinions about Facebook and LinkedIn, only reversed. Facebook, a holding in several USAA portfolios, including Science & Technology, is the one with the greater growth potential, in his view, because its everyman customers are more tolerant of having ads thrust in their faces than the professionals who use LinkedIn. ""They have huge opportunities to monetize their base,"" Toohey says about Facebook. Still, he encourages the company not to be greedy by saturating the site with ads or allowing ads that are targeted so precisely to users that it becomes obvious just how much information the company has on them.""People are fine being marketed to,"" Toohey says, ""but they need to strike a delicate balance.""AMAZON'S BALANCING ACT  Amazon.com, whose stock fell more than 25 percent earlier in the year, may need to execute a balancing act of its own. Amazon has spared little expense in growing its business to become a dominant retailer, but companies that spare little expense tend to have thin profit margins and generate anemic cash flow, Toohey notes. USAA Science & Technology delivered an annualized return of 21 percent in the past five years. The fund's expense ratio is 1.34 percent.""We own some Amazon, but we're cautious about it,"" he says. ""The challenge is whether they'll ever slow down spending to ramp up cash flow and margins.""Another possible impediment to Amazon and its shareholders is that it sends out so many packages at such short notice that delivery services like FedEx Corp. and United Parcel Service Inc. eventually may balk at doing the heavy lifting, at least at current prices.""Amazon could shoot themselves in the foot,"" Toohey warns. ""If FedEx and UPS are going to be able to support all that volume with two days' notice, they'll have to hire people and do logistics. Are they going to get paid for it?""Prospective buyers of tech high fliers may be asking themselves the same question. Recalling the 2000 crash, Landis concedes that investors can get hurt in companies like these, but he highlights a difference between now and then – a dearth of opportunities for growth in other assets.""After a long bull market, there's nothing to go back to,"" he says. ""When people take money off the table and look around, they see that gold is played out, at least for now; there's not much [to make] in bonds, and stocks of old-guard companies aren't growing that fast.

331,"   By Alexei Oreskovic | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Facebook Inc wants its users in India to hang up on advertisers. The Internet social networking company is testing a new type of ad in the country that allows mobile phone users to click a button that calls a brand advertiser, immediately hangs up and then receives a return call.The return call delivers pre-recorded audio messages about everything from sponsored cricket scores to information about shopping discounts, minimizing data charges for the user. The so-called “missed call” ad was specially created by Facebook to appeal to users in the world’s second-most populous country, and potentially in other emerging markets. Facebook has more than 100 million users in India, with the majority accessing the service on so-called feature phones, which lack touchscreens and other capabilities of higher-end smartphones.  The ads are part of Facebook’s effort to bolster its business in countries such as Brazil, India and Indonesia, which could help Facebook boost its overall revenue. Roughly 84 percent of Facebook’s 1.28 billion monthly users are outside the United States and Canada, but the average revenue per user that Facebook generates in international markets is significantly lower than in the United States and Canada.  Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg is in India this week visiting the company’s offices and meeting with partners. Last week, Facebook rival Google Inc Inc announced plans to bolster its business there by developing a sub-$100 smartphone that uses its Android software.Facebook has optimized the ads on its service to work on slower wireless connections in emerging markets and it is improving its tools in individual countries to help marketers better target different groups of users. The company has also recently opened sales offices in Colombia and Indonesia and it is working with measurement firm Nielsen to measure how mobile phone users react to ads. In early tests of the missed call ads by L’Oreal-owned haircare product Garnier Men, the ads led to a 2.5 times year-on-year increase in online sales, according to Facebook. In the coming months, Facebook said it plans to make the missed call ads more widely available.

The first Surgeon General's report on the health dangers of cigarettes was released in 1964, when more than 40 percent of American adults were already hooked. To date, more than 10 million Americans have died from illnesses tied to smoking tobacco.Research on e-cigarettes has moved more quickly, partly because scientists can draw on regular tobacco research to establish the biological effects of vaping. The cartridge-like devices were first introduced in the United States by start-up manufacturers in 2007.

Reynolds Vapor Co., a subsidiary of Reynolds American, began selling its Vuse e-cigarette nationwide last month and Altria's NuMark subsidiary plans to do so with its MarkTen later this year.The FDA got authority to regulate tobacco products, both traditional and novel, with the 2009 Tobacco Control Act. In April, the FDA proposed banning e-cigarette sales to minors, angering public health advocates who want more far-reaching prohibitions on online sales, advertising and flavors.The FDA began funding e-cigarette research in 2012. An FDA-funded project at the University of Louisville in Kentucky illustrates why the pace of science is slow.Scientists there will look at three or four brands of e-cigarettes and analyze their volatile organic compounds, flavorings and particulate matter to see how they affect lung and other cells in lab mice, said lead researcher Dr Sanjay Srivastata. This spring, he began exposing the animals to e-cigarette vapor for up to six months, with full results expected in 2015. While those findings could help FDA quantify risks from vaping, results extending the conclusions to humans are as much as five years away.THE 'PLEASURES OF NICOTINE' Another crucial question researchers are trying to answer is whether e-cigarettes will be used mostly by nicotine newbies, including adolescents; by ex-smokers craving a nicotine hit without the carcinogens of tobacco; or by smokers trying to quit.To get a handle on who is likely to use e-cigarettes, scientists at Georgia State University School of Public Health  will conduct online surveys of 6,000 people to assess whether they perceive e-cigarettes as less harmful than the traditional kind, why those who have switched from the latter to e-cigarettes did so, and what influences people's perceptions of the product's risk.""This is the kind of research that is going to be informing the FDA's regulatory process,"" said Michael Eriksen, dean of the School of Public Health and leader of three FDA-funded projects on tobacco.The FDA's proposed e-cigarette rules would give it the power to regulate the ingredients in the vaping liquid, but are silent on the plumes of vapor produced when the liquid is heated.

337,"   By Joseph Ax | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Former Guatemalan President Alfonso Portillo is scheduled to be released from a U.S. prison in February, more than five years after his arrest on money laundering charges.Portillo's Facebook page announced that he would be freed on February 25, 2015. Inmate records from the U.S. Bureau of Prisons confirmed the date.The Facebook post also said Portillo’s attorneys would seek to have him transferred from a New York prison to Florida and would seek permission for him to complete his sentence in Guatemala starting in September 2014.Portillo, 62, was sentenced to five years and 10 months in prison in May after admitting he took $2.5 million in bribes from Taiwan and laundered funds through U.S. banks.After his sentencing, his attorney, David Rosenfield, indicated he would seek credit for the more than four years Portillo had been incarcerated since 2010. Neither Rosenfield, nor the office of U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in Manhattan, which prosecuted the case, immediately responded to a request for comment.Portillo served as president of Guatemala from 2000 to 2004 and was extradited to the United States in May 2013 after a year-long fight. A Guatemalan court previously cleared him of local embezzlement charges.U.S. prosecutors initially accused Portillo of laundering tens of millions of dollars he embezzled from the Guatemalan government, including $2.5 million provided by Taiwan’s embassy in Guatemala. Portillo pleaded guilty in March to one charge of conspiring to launder money but said the money from Taiwan was actually a bribe offered in exchange for Guatemala’s continued diplomatic recognition.China claims the Taiwanese government is illegitimate; the two have been governed separately since 1949. Only 22 countries maintain diplomatic relations with Taiwan, including Vatican City, Paraguay, Panama, Haiti, Nicaragua and the tiny island countries of Nauru and Palau. As part of Portillo’s sentence, U.S. District Judge Robert Patterson also ordered him to forfeit $2.5 million.At his sentencing, Portillo touted his record as president, emphasizing tax and education reforms he instituted in Guatemala.“All men make mistakes as well as achievements in life,” he said in court.

338,"  BEIJING, July 10 Users in China were able to access online services for Google Inc on Thursday, after more than a month of severe disruption that almost completely blocked people from using features such as its search, maps and e-mail functions.The Google disruption began in the run-up to the 25th anniversary of the government's bloody crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators around Beijing's Tiananmen Square.China maintains tight control over the Internet, nipping in the bud any signs of dissent or challenges to the ruling Communist Party's leadership.Users told Reuters they could use Google Maps and access the Google.com search engine, which redirects to a Hong Kong version of the website. Reuters journalists were able to replicate this.Google declined to provide immediate comment. China-based anti-censorship group GreatFire.org also reported that Google services appeared to be accessible within China.""I'm not sure if it's a temporary glitch or a change of policy,"" said a member of the group who used a pseudonym. ""If Google indeed is unblocked, it's a big victory for free speech."" The member added that it was only a positive development if Google continued to use HTTPS, a form of encryption for websites that ensures individual search phrases cannot be censored within China.

China-based anti-censorship group GreatFire.org reported that Google services appeared once again to be inaccessible within China.The ""Great Firewall"", the tool the Communist Party uses to block websites it deems undesirable, experienced a glitch that allowed Google services to work, GreatFire.org said.

Audience is crucial for companies like Facebook, which make money by selling ads to advertisers interested in reaching its 1.28 billion monthly active users.Facebook's record traffic around the World Cup suggested the Menlo Park, California, company was increasingly used as a platform to discuss events in real time, a segment pioneered by microblogging website Twitter Inc. The widespread use of mobile phones that have made social media seemingly ubiquitous helped explain Facebook's record numbers.Germany's 1-0 win over Argentina in the World Cup final on Sunday was the most commented match of the tournament, with 88 million users and 280 million interactions, the company said.Brazil's star Neymar led the ranking of most talked about player, followed by Argentina's Lionel Messi, Portugal's Cristiano Ronaldo and Uruguay's Luis Suárez. And with 26 percent of all World Cup interactions, Brazil was the strongest voice in Facebook's biggest conversation ever. The United States accounted for 10 percent of the posts, comments and likes; Indonesia 6 percent; Mexico 5 percent and Argentina 4 percent.""Facebook was the global stadium for the 2014 World Cup,"" said Facebook's Grudin.

Line, owned by South Korea's Naver Corp, has hired Nomura Holdings Inc and Morgan Stanley to manage the IPO in Tokyo and is also considering listing in New York, the person said.Line and Naver declined to comment. An IPO would come amid a land-grab in the messaging app space, with Whatsapp recently snapped up by Facebook Inc  for $19 billion and Viber bought by online retailer Rakuten Inc  for $900 million.The Line messaging app has expanded rapidly overseas in Asia and America, claiming popularity with its games and oversized emoticons, called stickers. Global downloads have surpassed 480 million, the company said. The company recorded 14.6 billion yen in revenue in January-March - a more than threefold increase on the year. With full-year sales hitting 51.8 billion yen last year, Line was the highest-grossing non-game app of 2013, according to analytics firm App Annie.Another person familiar with the IPO plans said parent Naver is likely to favour the sale of preferred shares to prevent a third party taking control of Line, whereas Line would prefer to sell ordinary shares to increase the proportion of Japanese retail investors.A 57 percent rise in Japan's benchmark share index  last year spurred an increase in IPOs. Restaurant chain operator Skylark Co Ltd and game developer Gumi Inc are also planning to launch IPOs this year in Tokyo.($1 = 101.5700 Japanese Yen)   (Editing by Christopher Cushing)",2014-07-15,FB,"Tue Jul 15, 2014 | 3:56am EDT",UPDATE 1-Japanese messaging app Line files for IPO valued over $10 bln -source,http://www.reuters.com//article/line-ipo-idUSL4N0PQ26V20140715?type=companyNews

355,"   By Chuck Mikolajczak | NEW YORK  NEW YORK In the days after its infamously mishandled initial public offering in May 2012, it looked as if Facebook would struggle to become a must-own for fund managers. Now the company's $190 billion market value makes it bigger than such bellwethers as Coca-Cola and AT&T. It's not a member of the Dow industrials, but if it were, it would be larger than two-thirds of that index's 30 members. Shares of the world's No. 1 social network touched a record high of $76.74 on Thursday after earnings and revenues easily topped analysts' forecasts, boosting its market value to nearly $194 billion. That ranks it 15th in the Standard & Poor's 500 benchmark index, just below the $196 billion market cap of International Business Machines Corp. ""A 100-year-old company with real assets versus a company admittedly with virtual assets and they are trading at the same market cap – crazy,"" said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh.The speed of Facebook's rise to mega-cap status is what's notable. It took Apple Inc nearly three decades to achieve such a market value; Google Inc needed five years.Facebook has only been public for a little more than two years, and only joined the S&P 500 seven months ago. Since S&P Dow Jones Indices announced the addition on Dec. 11, Facebook shares have risen 54 percent.The gains represent a reversal of fortune for the social media company. After a botched IPO that infuriated investors in May 2012, the stock slumped, underperforming for 15 months before finally eclipsing its offering price of $38 in August 2013. Since then, Facebook shares have been unstoppable, doubling in less than a year.""People understand the world is moving to mobile, and when you look at the time spent on mobile, Facebook has the lion's share,"" said Walter Price, senior portfolio manager and managing director of the AllianzGI Global Technology fund, which owned more than a million shares as of June 30.  The firm has leveraged its position by selling put options, or negative bets on the stock, and buying more call options, or bets on the shares rising further. ""This is a momentum stock you can put a P/E on,"" Price said.Facebook's rally has left e-commerce giant Amazon Inc in the dust. That company's value peaked around $187 billion in January, but closed Thursday at $165 billion. Amazon reported disappointing results afterwards, which dragged down its stock by 7 percent, valuing the company around $153 billion.Facebook's market cap is still dwarfed by the roughly $403 billion in combined market cap for the two classes of Google shares, arguably the most similar in terms of revenue generation. However, Facebook tops The Coca-Cola Co by about $15 billion and Disney by more than $40 billion.SHORT, QUICK TRIP   Apple, the S&P 500's most valuable company, needed nearly three decades before its market value finally rose to more than $190 billion, surpassing that level in late December 2009. Google's move was swifter. The company went public in August 2004, and posted a closing market value of more than $190 billion for the first time in October 2007, right around the S&P's peak before the financial crisis.That's not to say there aren't detractors. StarMine, a Thomson Reuters company, sees Facebook as more overvalued than 95 percent of the companies in its stock universe. Using expected growth rates over the next decade, StarMine puts an intrinsic value of $29 on the stock. It has a high price-to-earnings ratio of 42, more overvalued than 90 percent of the stocks StarMine tracks.However, the stock's relentless march has left few willing to stand in its way. Investors betting on the stock falling have dried up. In August 2012, more than 80 percent of shares available for short bets were being borrowed by investors expecting the stock to drop, according to Markit. Now, just 0.4 percent of shares available are being used for short bets.   Of the 43 analysts with recommendations on the stock, 37 are ""strong buy"" or ""buy"" ratings, with six ""hold"" ratings. ""If you were looking to short names that were ridiculously overvalued and people were not even thinking the growth was going to continue, I wouldn't put Facebook in that category,"" said Stephen Massocca, managing director at Wedbush Equity Management LLC in San Francisco. ""That being said, do I buy Facebook here? From my perspective, I am a value investor - I wouldn't get anywhere near it with a 10-foot pole.""         That acceptance of Facebook's legitimacy as a successful and viable company makes the comparison to the classic names that now surround it on the market cap list more palatable.""In some respects, Facebook speaks to a demographic shift in the way retailing, social media and virtually every other component of people’s lives is being bundled,"" said Peter Kenny, chief market strategist at Clearpool Group in New York. ""Investors are starting to see the brilliance of this platform in ways that haven’t to date really captured the imagination of many.""

361,"   By Supantha Mukherjee  Shares of Facebook Inc (FB.O) hit a record high on Thursday after a surge in mobile advertising revenue helped the world's No. 1 social network trounce analysts' expectations for quarterly profit and revenue.The company's shares, which touched a high of $76.74, were up 7 percent at $76.31 by midday on the Nasdaq.At that price, Facebook's market value is just short of  $200 billion, putting the company in position to overtake IBM Corp (IBM.N) as the fourth-largest U.S.-listed tech company.The top three are Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Google Inc (GOOGL.O) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O).At least 28 brokerages raised their price targets on the stock, by as much as $15 to a high of $100.At $100, Facebook would be valued at more than $250 billion.Facebook reported on Wednesday that its mobile advertising revenue grew 151 percent in the second quarter, accounting for about 62 percent overall ad revenue. ""Facebook has, so far, effectively addressed one of the most significant overhangs from its IPO days - the lack of mobile monetization,"" RBC Capital Markets analysts said in a note. Facebook's initial public offering in May 2012 was widely considered to be a flop. The stock, priced at $38, fell for months after the debut as investors worried about the company's ability to make money from mobile advertising.With people increasingly accessing the Internet from smartphones and tablets, companies such as Facebook, Google Inc (GOOG.O) and Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) have been looking for ways to generate more revenue from the smaller screens.""We estimate that FB accounts for $1 of every $5 ad dollars spent on mobile devices,"" Needham and Co analysts wrote in a client note.Facebook now represents about 20 percent of total time spent on mobile devices, according to research firm comScore data. ""We think 2Q represents further validation that Facebook can continue to drive mobile ad revenue growth through better ad targeting, relevancy and quality, and through continued growth in advertiser demand in its ad auction,"" JP Morgan analysts wrote in research report.JP Morgan, which kept its ""overweight"" rating on the stock, raised its price target to $90 from $80.Of the 43 analysts covering the stock, 37 have a ""buy"" or a higher rating on the stock and six a ""hold"". There are no ""sell"" ratings, according to StarMine data.Facebook's quarterly revenue of $2.91 billion beat the average analyst estimate of $2.81 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Those measures were proposed after a Malaysian Airlines plane was downed over Ukraine last week, killing 298, possibly by a missile furnished by Russia.Data showed the services sector across the 18-member euro zone performed better than any of the 39 economists polled by Reuters had forecast. Manufacturers also reported a stronger month than the median Reuters forecast had predicted. More EU sanctions are likely to weigh on a fragile recovery and stoked bets of even looser monetary policy from the European Central Bank. The ECB cut interest rates in June and left the door open to further monetary loosening, which would hurt the euro.The latest euro zone business data are ""a marginal positive, but I don't think the ECB will change its view on a modest recovery,"" said Brian Dangerfield, currency strategist at RBS Securities in Stamford, Connecticut.MSCI's All-World Index was up 0.1 percent, while European stocks .FTEU3 were up 0.2 percent.The Dow Jones industrial average rose 11.75 points or 0.07 percent, to 17,098.38, the S&P 500 gained 1.47 points or 0.07 percent, to 1,988.48 and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 3.69 points or 0.08 percent, to 4,470.01. A better-than-expected U.S. earnings season is helping sentiment. So far this earnings period, 68.5 percent of earnings reports are beating analysts' expectations, above the 63 percent average since 1994, Thomson Reuters data showed.On Thursday, drugmakers Bristol-Myers Squibb and Eli Lilly both beat Wall Street expectations, helped by cost controls.Emerging-market stocks, last up 0.2 percent, hit 17-month highs after stronger-than-expected HSBC flash PMI data for China, the world's second-largest economy.In the foreign exchange market, the euro fell to an eight-month low of $1.3448 in early European trading on the EBS trading system before rebounding to a session high of $1.34855  after the euro zone 'flash' composite survey was released, showing the index at a three-month high in July. The single currency was last $1.3471, up 0.05 percent from Wednesday's U.S. close.U.S. Treasury debt prices fell after data showing initial jobless claims in the world's largest economy dropped to their lowest in more than eight years.But losses may be limited by safe-haven buying with tensions still high in the Middle East and Ukraine.Russia's five-year credit default swaps rose 17 basis points to 214 bps from earlier on Thursday, according to Markit, following the EU sanctions proposals, which the EU said were likely to be adopted next week.That means it costs $214,000 a year for five years to insure $10 million of Russian debt against default. Russian government bonds fell.Ten-year U.S. Treasuries were down 13/32 in price to yield 2.508 percent. The yield hit a peak of 2.518 percent, the highest since July 18.Crude oil prices ran into renewed selling after a bounce on Wednesday. Brent crude for September delivery fell 66 cents to $107.37 a barrel. U.S. crude lost 48 cents to $102.64.

Jobless claims fell to the lowest since mid-February 2006, pointing to continued strength in the labor market, but new home sales fell 8.1 percent in June, the most in almost a year, and May's initial reading of a more than 18 percent gain was revised to just above 8 percent, putting a damper on sentiment as the housing market struggles.""Housing certainly seems to be the one theme that prevents this economic recovery and earnings story from being a fairly tale, it is the one reminder there are issues,"" said Peter Kenny, chief market strategist at Clearpool Group in New York.He said the bullishness behind the strong job numbers was partly offset by market concern that it could translate into a faster route to normalizing monetary policy. However, earnings season is ""really quite solid, largely hitting on all cylinders in terms of top and bottom line and revenue growth.""The Dow Jones industrial average rose 7.51 points or 0.04 percent, to 17,094.14, the S&P 500 gained 0.66 points or 0.03 percent, to 1,987.67 and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 4.10 points or 0.09 percent, to 4,469.60. At its session high, the S&P was 0.5 percent away from hitting 2,000.Facebook was the poster child for strong earnings following a better-than-forecast 61 percent increase in revenue during the second quarter. Shares jumped 5.6 percent to $75.30, giving the social media giant a market capitalization of $193 billion, roughly the sum of Dow components McDonald's  and UTX.Sports apparel manufacturer and retailer Under Armour  jumped 10.5 percent to $67 after quarterly revenue rose by more than a third. On the flip side D.R. Horton, the No.1 U.S. homebuilder, fell 8 percent to $22.77 after it reported a 23 percent slump in third-quarter profit.The housing data also hurt homebuilders, with a sector index  down 1.6 percent.Ford shares rose 1.4 percent to $18.03 after profit beat expectations while GM dropped 4 percent to $35.87 on a lower second-quarter profit due to numerous recalls and the expected cost of at least $400 million for its victims' compensation fund.Drugmakers Bristol-Myers Squibb and Eli Lilly  both beat Wall Street expectations, helped by cost controls. Bristol shares edged up 0.4 percent to $49.54 and Eli Lilly dipped 0.3 percent to $64.03.Markets earlier got support from an expansion in China's factory activity and the euro zone's private sector.

367,"   By Edwin Chan | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) halted a slowdown in user-growth in the second quarter with the help of product tweaks and services built around the summer's World Cup, assuaging concerns for now that the online messaging service had peaked.Shares of the company soared 35 percent on Tuesday after it reported monthly active users had risen a better-than-expected 24 percent, chalking up what would be its largest gain in a single day and adding almost $7 billion to its market value.Twitter, which has battled to reverse a steady decline in its once-heady pace of growth, surpassed targets for virtually every metric Wall Street scrutinizes. Expectations had subsided ever since the company stunned investors in February with disappointingly low user growth.Before Tuesday's after-hours surge, Twitter had lost about 40 percent of its market value since the start of 2014. The company now needs to demonstrate several quarters of respectable growth before investors can again back the 10-year-old company's growth story, analysts said.""The expectations going in had become quite low,"" said Sterne Agee analyst Arvind Bhatia. ""Even in the U.S. their performance was good. For now, that will put to rest some of the concerns about U.S. growth.""""One would still have to say that the jury is still out,"" Bhatia said. ""You have to look maybe at what happens in the next quarter and see if they can continue to have upside on the user growth.""        Twitter saw users increase to 271 million, still dwarfed by rival Facebook Inc's (FB.O) 1.3 billion. Wall Street analysts had been expecting a pace of growth closer to 21 percent.Timeline views, a measure of the engagement of its users, also exceeded expectations with a 15 percent increase, far outpacing the roughly 8 percent expected. Twitter, whose rapid-fire format has proven popular as a companion to major global events, may have enjoyed a boost from the World Cup. The world's most popular sporting event peaked with the finals in July.Chief Executive Dick Costolo said in a conference call with analysts on Tuesday that the football tournament led existing users to spend more time on Twitter but did not contribute to the rise in new users during the quarter. For the current quarter, Twitter is forecasting revenue of $330 million to $340 million, outpacing forecasts for around $323.7 million, according to analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Its shares jumped to $51.20 in extended trading, from a close of $38.59 on the New York Stock Exchange. BRIDGE TOO FAR User growth has stagnated since Twitter went public to much fanfare in November. Yet it remains valued at almost 200 times earnings, based on bullish investors' belief it can eventually transform itself into an Internet platform on the same scale as Facebook. Incoming Finance Chief Anthony Noto set expectations high on Tuesday, telling analysts that he believed Twitter can build the ""largest audience in the world."" Twitter executives noted several times on the call that the service's reach is greater than its 271 million monthly users, citing hundreds of millions of other people who visit the website or are exposed to Twitter content without being logged in to the service.Some investors argue its reported user numbers do not fully reflect engagement, particularly with media viewers. Others say its inherently complex format deters wider adoption.    At its peak, Twitter enjoyed a $46 billion capitalization on $665 million of revenue in 2013, making it at the time one of the world's priciest stocks.    But in past few months, Twitter has granted more prominent placement to photographs to liven up its interface, simplified the sign-up process, and allowed ads touting mobile-app installations to drive up revenue.It reported a 124 percent jump in quarterly revenue to $312 million, beating expectations for $283.1 million. It posted non-GAAP net income of $14.6 million or 2 cents a share, reversing a loss of $16.4 million or 12 cents a share a year earlier.

370,"  (Adds short interest, closing stock price)By Supantha MukherjeeJuly 30 The surge in Twitter Inc's  stock has revived debate about whether it warrants a valuation five times that of Facebook Inc, its biggest rival in social media.Twitter reported on Tuesday that its active users jumped 24 percent to 271 million in the second quarter. That pales when compared with Facebook's 1.3 billion.Even so, Twitter's shares were trading at about 200 times forward earnings on Wednesday, against Facebook's 39.4 times, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine. If Facebook was trading at Twitter's valuation, it would be worth nearly $1 trillion.Twitter's shares finished almost 20 percent higher at $46.30, giving the company a market value of about $27.3 billion. The stock notched its biggest single-day gain since going public in November, and its third-biggest daily volume with almost 116 million shares changing hands.Active users of Twitter increased more than expected in the  quarter as the micro-messaging service introduced product tweaks and services, many built around the soccer World Cup.Advertising revenue more than doubled to $277 million in the three months ended June 30. The results were good, Pivotal Research Group analyst Brian Weiser wrote in a research report, but they did not warrant a nearly 30 percent rise in the stock price.Weiser joined the few analysts who have a ""sell"" rating on the stock, cutting his recommendation from ""hold.""At least five brokerages raised their ratings on the stock, while at least 21 raised price targets, by as much as $18 to a high of $65.StarMine data on Wednesday showed that of 34 analysts covering the stock, 13 have a ""buy"" or a higher rating, 16 have a ""hold"" and five have a ""sell"" or equivalent rating. Just about 12 percent of the shares available to be lent out were being borrowed for short bets as of Tuesday, according to Markit data, a relatively low amount for a high-growth momentum name such as Twitter.""SUPER PREMIUM"" Analysts at RBC Capital Markets were among those saying that Twitter deserved its high valuation. ""On valuation, yes, (Twitter) is the highest multiple stock we cover,"" the analysts wrote. ""But it also has the highest growth rates, too. So we view (the) super-premium multiples as well-warranted.""Goldman Sachs and others cited Twitter's potential to make more money from its platform and extend its real-time information edge into traditional media.""We continue to believe we are in the early stages of a very long growth cycle for Twitter as it leverages cultural ubiquity, invests in product and technology, and grows the platform,"" Goldman Sachs analysts wrote.Goldman maintained its ""buy"" rating and raised its price target to $63 from $52.Twitter's user growth stagnated after it went public to much fanfare in November, leading to a management shake-up that resulted in the departure of Chief Operating Officer Ali Rowghani.""This quarter's results take away one of the major bear arguments for the stock, namely that the user base is small and maturing,"" Janney Capital Markets analysts said in a report.Up to Tuesday's close, Twitter had lost nearly half of its market value since its shares hit a record high of $74.73 in December. The stock went public at $26 per share.

The Internet.org app will offer, in partnership with wireless operator Airtel , more than a dozen services including online encyclopedia Wikipedia, websites devoted to weather, job listings and health information, as well as Facebook's own social network and messaging service.The app will be available in additional countries over the coming months and years, Guy Rosen, product management director for Facebook's Internet.org effort said on Wednesday. Facebook will not pay Airtel for the bandwidth, Rosen said, but Airtel will benefit as users who are exposed to Internet services eventually decide to pay for broader, unrestricted access.Access to the information on the app's included services is free, but links that lead to information on other websites will require that users pay wireless data charges. The free version of Facebook in the app does not allow for the video playback. Facebook has partnered with more than 150 wireless providers over the past four years to offer free or discounted access to its social network, but the new app in Zambia marks the first time the company has added Web services beyond its own social network to the menu of free services. The move comes as Facebook steps up investments in its Internet.org project, which seeks to connect the “next 5 billion” users to the Internet, many of whom lives in places like Africa and India.  In March Facebook announced plans to use drones and satellites to deliver Internet connectivity to people in certain parts of the world.   The initiative has the potential to boost the size of Facebook’s audience, which currently totals 1.32 billion monthly users.

373,"   By Jennifer Baires | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Commuter shuttles run by Google Inc, Facebook Inc and other Silicon Valley companies began paying on Friday to make stops at San Francisco bus stations after protests blamed them for gentrification.The private buses, which for years have taken tech workers from San Francisco to their offices in Silicon Valley, have in recent months drawn criticism from groups who say that by catering to well-paid professionals, the buses lead to higher rents in diverse, low-income neighborhoods.Protesters also have said the vehicles get in the way of municipal buses.Under an 18-month pilot program that launched on Friday, the shuttle services will be allowed to use bus stops at over 100 locations throughout the city and in exchange they will pay at least $3.55 each time they pick up or drop off passengers, officials said.The program has not completely quieted protests. A group of about two dozen demonstrators gathered in the Mission District on Friday to express continuing anger at the buses, which glided by them with their new, bright green permit placards. The San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA) estimates there are 35,000 daily trips made on the shuttles, and that through this program it will raise $3.7 million to cover costs for making sure they run smoothly. “We're grateful to the SFMTA for taking the lead on the pilot and look forward to working with the city and participating shuttle operators to refine the program,” a Google spokesman said in a statement.  Richard Drury, lead attorney in a lawsuit filed in May against the city and a number of companies involved in the shuttle bus program, said exhaust fumes from the buses are a concern in neighborhoods where they operate.  “The Mission District, a historically Latino area, is ground zero for this program,” Drury said. “One of the main impacts of the program is that it allows high-income people to displace low-income residents in the Mission.”His group is calling for the city to put more effort into studying effects of the shuttle buses. SFMTA declined to comment on the lawsuit.“For many years now we’ve had commuter shuttles operating within the city,” said SFMTA spokeswoman Kristen Holland. “They are large charter buses that are regulated as vehicles themselves, outside of our purview. We’re just regulating where they stop.” (Editing by Alex Dobuzinskis, Bernard Orr)",2014-08-01,FB,"Fri Aug 1, 2014 | 5:34pm EDT","Google, Facebook pay for shuttles to use San Francisco bus stops",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-usa-buses-sanfrancisco-idUSKBN0G154A20140801?type=companyNews

Legal proceedings are then effectively run as a class action.Schrems is claiming damages of 500 euros ($670) per user for alleged data violations, including aiding the U.S. National Security Agency in running its Prism program, which mined the personal data of users of Facebook and other web services.The 26-year-old is also seeking injunctions under EU data-protection law at the court in data-privacy-friendly Austria. ""Our aim is to make Facebook finally operate lawfully in the area of data protection,"" he said.Facebook has come under fire before for allegedly violating data-protection laws. Most recently, Britain's data watchdog began investigating whether a 2012 experiment on unwitting users, in which it tried to alter their emotional state to see if their postings turned more positive or negative.The world's biggest social network, Facebook now has 1.32 billion users.

""If we can get a class action through like this, it will send out a huge signal to the industry overall.""Schrems has had limited success pursuing cases in Ireland, home to the European or international headquarters of some of the largest U.S. technology companies, including Microsoft and Google, who employ thousands there.His europe-v-facebook group appealed to the Irish High Court to rule on allegations that U.S. companies helped the NSA harvest private data from EU citizens after the Irish data watchdog said there were no grounds for an investigation.

387,"   By Svea Herbst-Bayliss and Sam Forgione  Aug 14 Top U.S. hedge fund managers did some shopping for shares of discount retailer Dollar General Corp  and drug store operator Walgreen Co in the second quarter.Daniel Loeb's Third Point added 1 million shares of Dollar General, raising his stake by 33 percent, while Blue Ridge Capital, founded by Tiger Cub John Griffin, nearly doubled its stake in Walgreen when it bought 2.8 million shares. That translated into 4.57 percent of the fund's portfolio.Walgreen, which purchased a controlling stake in Britain's Alliance Boots, earlier this month decided not to relocate its corporate headquarters to Europe to save on taxes, a strategy known as inversion. It faced complications in pulling off the transaction and heavy political pressure in the United States not to move..Billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn, Family Dollar Stores' largest shareholder with a 9.4 percent stake, wanted the company to sell itself to rival Dollar General in the face of stiff competition from big-box retailers such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. But in July, Family Dollar agreed to sell itself to Dollar Tree Inc.Meanwhile, botox maker Allergan Inc has waged a full throttle defense to avert a hostile takeover by Valeant Pharmaceutical's. Allergan's biggest shareholder, activist investor William Ackman, has called on other shareholders to side with him and ask Allergan to call a special shareholder meeting.During the second quarter, when Valeant first announced its bid, Allergan's stock price shot higher.Farallon Capital Management, the hedge fund founded by Tom Steyer, opened a new position in Allergan during the second quarter, buying 612,500 shares. Andrew Feldstein's Blue Mountain Capital also opened a new Allergan position, buying 635,925 shares, which made up nearly 2 percent of the portfolio at the end of the second quarter.The quarterly disclosures of manager stock holdings, in what are known as 13F filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, are always intriguing to investors trying to divine a pattern in what savvy traders are selling and buying.But relying on the filings to develop an investment strategy comes with some peril because the disclosures are backward looking and come out 45 days after the end of each quarter.Still, the filings offer a glimpse into what hedge fund managers saw as opportunities to make money on the long side.The filings do not disclose short positions, bets that a stock will fall in price. As a result, the public filings do not always present a complete picture of a manager's stock holdings.The following are some of the hot stocks and sectors in which hedge fund managers either took new positions or exited existing positions in the second quarter.APPLE INC  Philippe Laffont's Coatue Management upped its stake by 9.9 million shares to 10.1 million shares.Blue Ridge Capital sold its stake in, getting rid of 2.2 million shares.COVIDIEN PLC Covidien is being bought by rival Medtronic in another inversion deal, in which Medtronic wants to move its headquarters to Ireland to take advantage of lower corporate tax rates.Farallon opened a new position buying 2.2 million shares. DOLLAR GENERAL CORP While Loeb's Third Point increased its stake in Dollar General, Farallon closed out its position, selling 3.2 million shares. Tiger Consumer also liquidated its 814,723-share position, which had made up 2 percent of its portfolio.DOW CHEMICAL CO Loeb's Third Point, already a big investor in the company, increased his bet dramatically by buying 14.7 million shares, to raise his holdings by 204 percent. The company now ranks as Loeb's biggest U.S. stock holding, at nearly 14 percent of the portfolio.EBAY INC  Barry Rosenstein's Jana Partners cut its stake by 2.9 million shares to 1 million shares.FACEBOOK INC Putnam Investments raised its holding by 30 percent and bought 1.2 million shares.GENERAL MOTORS CO Putnam Investments increased its stake in GM by 13 percent when it bought 849,076 shares.WALGREEN CO Stanley Druckenmiller's Duquesne Family Office held its stake in Walgreen's steady at 1.2 million shares, ranking it as the portfolio's third-largest position.Jana Partners cut its stake by 1 million shares to 11.1 million shares. Third Point added a new position, buying 700,000 shares.ZYNGA INC Patrick McCormack's Tiger Consumer Management added a new position, having bought 18,062,145 shares.

390,"   By Se Young Lee | SEOUL  SEOUL Shareholders of South Korean internet portal operator Daum Communications Corp and messaging app company Kakao Corp on Wednesday approved a merger of the two firms in an all-stock deal that values Kakao at more than $3 billion.Kakao's KakaoTalk is the undisputed chat leader in South Korea, but its global user base is far smaller than the likes of Facebook Inc's WhatsApp or Naver Corp's Line. The merger with Daum, South Korea's No. 2 internet search company, will give Kakao new lines of revenue and boost its resources for overseas expansion. The deal, announced in May and set to be completed in October, is also effectively a back-door listing that allows Kakao to avoid a time-consuming initial public offering. According to regulatory filings, Daum will issue 43 million new shares to Kakao shareholders based on a valuation of 72,910 won per share, valuing the messaging app operator at 3.1 trillion won ($3.06 billion).  But Daum failed to muster the necessary two-thirds vote from its shareholders for a set of changes to its articles of incorporation, some of which could have given the merged company greater fund-raising flexibility in the future. Some of the changes called for giving the enlarged entity the right to double the maximum number of shares it can issue to 200 million and to sell convertible preferred shares with voting rights. Both could have a dilutive effect on shareholder value.Daum spokeswoman Jody Chung said the vote rejecting the changes to its articles of incorporation has no impact on the merger or the company's medium- to long-term strategy.  Daum's shares ended down 5.9 percent on Wednesday, their biggest daily percentage drop since February 2013. ""It appears that some investors may have read too much into the rejection and speculated that there might be something going on, but there was nothing to suggest that the merger is going to fall apart,"" said Park Jung-hoon, a fund manager at HDC Asset Management, adding that some investors may have opted to take profit on the stock as well.    While Daum did not disclose the vote count or which investors opposed the changes, a spokeswoman for South Korea's National Pension Service, the world's fourth-largest pension fund, said it voted against some of the changes to protect its interests.  The fund, which held a 6.9 percent Daum stake as of this month, is known to occasionally flex its muscle on ballot proposals, voting no on 216 of 2,441 votes, or nearly 9 percent of the time, in the first quarter of 2014. The combined entity will be called Daum Kakao, but that needs to be approved by shareholders at a post-merger shareholder meeting.

The headset, into which the Note 4 can be docked, will have four visual settings that simulate experiences such as sitting in a theater or being on stage.The headset is a beta version for ""developers and enthusiasts; it's going to be sold online only,"" Oculus VR Chief Executive Brendan Iribe said. ""It's not mass-market consumer ready."" Samsung did not announce a price for the product but said it would be available later this year.The Gear VR is not the first mobile virtual reality headset.

399,"   By Bill Rigby | SEATTLE  SEATTLE In the last week of August, Twitter entertained dozens of potential young recruits at a chic studio, while Facebook served drinks and snacks to job-seekers at its own office. More than 175 showed up to a similar event at Google in June. San Francisco? No, Seattle, home of Microsoft Corp and Amazon and fast becoming a second home for Silicon Valley companies looking to access the city's plentiful pool of relatively cheap tech talent.Microsoft alumni are now running the Seattle offices of Facebook Inc, Twitter Inc and Google Inc, and they look to their former employer as a source for new talent. Microsoft has always suffered some loss of talent to competitors, but it now has to battle attractive companies in its own backyard to hire the tech stars it needs to reposition itself as a leader in mobile and the cloud.""A lot of our top engineers are from Microsoft and they are doing really well,"" said Rohit Wad, who leads Facebook's Seattle office after an 18-year career at Microsoft. ""The deep computer science knowledge they have is directly applicable to a lot of work we do.""Facebook has more than 400 employees in Seattle, up from 125 only two years ago, vastly outstripping the social network's overall growth. It recently took over a second floor in its rented offices to handle the overflow, and is starting to fill a third. ""There's a depth of engineering talent and experienced engineers here,"" said Wad, whose team does a lot of work relating to Facebook's platform and mobile development. ""That's a big contingent here in Seattle because we can get people who are proficient in that. There is meaty, fulfilling work here."" Google now has more than 1,400 employees in two centers in the Seattle area, with the engineering work run by Microsoft veteran Chee Chew. Twitter opened its Seattle office in January and has almost 100 employees under Jeff Currier, another former Microsoft manager.""We have a huge talent pool in the city,"" said Hillel Cooperman, a former Microsoft executive who founded his own software firm and design consultancy in Seattle with former colleagues called Jackson Fish Market. ""It's less expensive to hire them up here, so why wouldn't you?""Software developer salaries start at about $95,000 in Seattle, compared to about $109,000 in San Francisco, according to recruiting company Robert Half Technology. Washington was the fifth fastest-growing state for computer-related jobs in the first half of this year, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Texas, Florida, North Carolina and Oregon were the four fastest.""It’s really hard to find great talent in any market, but the Bay Area is a freakin' knife fight,"" said Brett Thompson, who runs human resources and recruiting at Seattle-based data visualization firm Tableau Software Inc. ""That's why you see a lot of companies from the Bay Area coming up here. It actually feels like there's a more plentiful amount of talent in Seattle.""         MICROSOFT, AMAZON ANCHOR Microsoft and Amazon are the engines that power tech employment in the Seattle area, bringing in thousands of graduates and qualified programmers every year from around the United States and the world. Many subsequently leave those companies, but don't want to give up the laid-back, relatively cheap Seattle way of life. They often go to one of the Silicon Valley invaders, or the rash of startups that are becoming forces in their own right, such as Zillow, Tableau and Zulily. ""Microsoft people tend to leave after their reviews in the summer and then September when they get their bonuses,"" said Jerry Taylor, president of Executive Recruiters Inc in Seattle, who has been placing tech candidates in the city since 1977. Turnover has been heating up this summer, after Microsoft began laying off 1,351 around the Seattle region in July, many of them involved in testing Windows software. Microsoft currently has 1,289 vacancies in the area on LinkedIn, almost half of them with the word 'cloud' in the title.Albert Squiers, director of technology recruiting at Fuel Talent in Seattle, said the ripple effect of the layoffs was starting to be felt in the region, and he has already been contacted by a handful of job-seekers from Microsoft. Taylor said he has seen an ""influx.""The ebb of talent from Microsoft is potentially damaging to the software giant if it continues to lose mobile-savvy people to younger rivals.""I definitely think that Microsoft is challenged to bring in top talent,"" said Scott Ruthfield, a former Microsoft and Amazon manager who founded the tech recruiting and consulting firm Rooster Park. ""There are growth companies that tell a more exciting story.""Microsoft executives declined to discuss the issue, but a spokesman said Seattle's growth as a tech hub was good for everybody: ""It is a boon to both the local tech industry and the overall regional economy, and benefits companies of all sizes.""      QUALITY OF LIFE Despite the more frequent rain, many rising tech stars end up liking Seattle more than the Bay Area for the space and low rents.""People like the quality of life in the Pacific Northwest, the outdoors, the traffic and the cost of living,"" said Megan Slabinski, who runs Robert Half Technology's recruiting business on the west coast. ""Oftentimes, candidates are not as willing to relocate to the Bay Area, once they live in the Pacific Northwest.""Shravan Goli, president at online tech job site Dice.com, a former Microsoft employee now working in the Bay Area, said it was hard to get his old colleagues to join him. California's state income tax is as high as 12.3 percent for top earners, compared to zero in Washington. ""There's a huge cost of living differential, and state tax,"" he said. ""I felt the pinch when I moved down."" One employee even kayaks across Seattle's Lake Union to work at Tableau, which is now worth more than $4 billion after going public last year and has expanded its workforce by 65 percent in the last 12 months.""It's so hard to hire people now,"" said Goli at Dice. ""That's driving the necessity for companies to get more creative and find other pockets, like Seattle, to go set up shop.""

407,"   By Jessica Toonkel and John McCrank  Alibaba Group Holding Ltd could have sold nearly $2 billion worth of stock without lifting a finger. All it had to do was list its shares on Nasdaq. That listing would have guaranteed Alibaba inclusion in the Nasdaq 100 Index by the end of the year, and funds which track the index would have had to buy.But two sources familiar with the situation said Alibaba executives worried about Nasdaq's ability to handle their $21 billion initial public offering later this month, since the exchange botched Facebook's market debut two years ago. Nasdaq tried to persuade Alibaba that it had fixed the problem, the sources said, but it is not clear whether they were swayed. One of the sources said that Alibaba eventually was satisfied that Nasdaq had solved the issue and chose NYSE because its overall pitch was better. The other said Nasdaq executives believed that Alibaba decided that the possibility of a botched IPO, however small, outweighed the possible benefits of being in the index.Alibaba and NYSE declined to comment, while a spokesman for Nasdaq, which has repeatedly said it has fixed the issues that went wrong in the Facebook IPO, said ""It was a close race, and we wish Alibaba well.""Alibaba’s misgivings about Nasdaq’s technology, two years after Facebook’s glitch-ridden, $16 billion market debut, show the incident continues to threaten Nasdaq's reputation.Listings contributed only 12 percent of Nasdaq's $1.9 billion in revenues in 2013, and large listings such as Alibaba’s are less profitable for exchanges, but within the financial community they are taken as a barometer of success. Nasdaq systems buckled under the tremendous volume of orders on the first day of trading in Facebook’s shares in 2012, leading to hours of delay.In its presentation to Alibaba, Nasdaq detailed the steps it had taken to prevent another Facebook-style glitch, two sources familiar with the pitch said. The exchange has said it responded to Facebook by putting extra safeguards in place, creating new positions within the company to improve communications with the industry and regulators when errors occur, and establishing an engineering team to monitor and analyze daily performance.         INDEX FUND BEDROCK  The decision not to go with Nasdaq meant that Alibaba may not join any major global index this year.""There is a pretty strong argument that index inclusion equals stability,"" Kevin Landis, chief investment officer of Firsthand Capital Management, a Silicon-Valley-based technology-investing specialist with $400 million in assets under management. ETFs and mutual funds that track such benchmarks have to buy and hold their stock. The Nasdaq 100, which includes companies such as Apple and Google, has a market capitalization of $4.75 trillion. Funds such as the $46.8 billion QQQ PowerShares exchange-traded fund, the fifth-biggest ETF in the world, track the Nasdaq 100, according to data from Thomson Reuters' Lipper service.  If the IPO values the company at $200 billion, Alibaba would have been about 3.3 percent of the index. There are more than $54 billion in ETF assets alone linked to the index, which means at least $1.7 billion would have flown into Alibaba shares. The chance to get on Nasdaq 100 was a selling point for Facebook itself. In the lead-up to the Facebook IPO, Nasdaq reduced the amount of time a qualifying firm needs to be listed on Nasdaq in order to be added in the index to three months from a year.Alibaba doesn’t qualify to be on many of the world’s major indices, since it is registered in the Cayman Islands. The behemoth S&P 500 Index, which has a market capitalization of $18.6 trillion, only lists U.S. companies.The Chinese firm is not eligible to be part of the biggest MSCI or FTSE indices for other reasons, although MSCI is looking at changing its index rules in a way that could put Alibaba on a major index.And finally, Alibaba gave up a chance for mainland Chinese  to invest, since China-based money manager Guotai Asset Management's Guotai Nasdaq 100 Index trades on the Shanghai Stock Exchange. ""It falls into this no man’s land of indexing,"" said Dennis Hudachek, a senior ETF specialist with ETF.com, an expert on exchange-traded funds.

408,"  (Adds analyst quotes, details)By Mia Shanley and Bill RigbySTOCKHOLM/SEATTLE, Sept 15 Microsoft Corp  has agreed to acquire the Stockholm-based developer of the wildly popular Minecraft video game for $2.5 billion, as it tries to lure a new and mostly young audience into its mobile world.Minecraft - a construction game in which players can build nearly anything imaginable, block by block, in a digital, Lego-like world - has spread like wildfire since its full release by developer Mojang in 2011.Minecraft is the top paid-for app both on Apple Inc's  iOS and Google Inc's Android systems and helped Mojang, which employs just 40 people, bring in 2.05 billion crowns ($287 million) in revenue in 2013, giving it an 896 million crown ($126 million) operating profit for the year.Director of website Gamesbrief Nicholas Lovell described Minecraft as a hugely successful product which has ""captured the imagination of pretty much everybody under the age of 15"", saying the game could help Microsoft broaden its appeal.While the Mojang team will join Microsoft studios behind global franchises such as ""Halo"" and ""Fable"", its three co-founders, who have been chased by the likes of Napster co-founder and early Facebook Inc investor Sean Parker, will be leaving to start new projects.As if to erase any doubts about the importance of gaming, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said it was a ""top activity"" spanning devices from PCs and consoles to tablets and mobiles,  with billions of hours devoted to it each year.""Minecraft is more than a great game franchise - it is an open world platform, driven by a vibrant community we care deeply about, and rich with new opportunities for that community and for Microsoft,"" Nadella said on Monday.Microsoft has spent lavishly in the Nordic region in recent years, buying the handset business of Nokia for $7.2 billion in a deal which closed this year. In 2011, it spent $8.5 billion on Skype, which has its roots in Scandinavia and the Baltics. Some analysts were positive about the acquisition.""The news robustly dismisses the idea that games are no longer at the core of Microsoft's strategic direction and also underlines the growing importance of independent titles alongside big-budget games,"" Piers Harding-Rolls, head of games at IHS Technology, wrote in a note.FBR Capital Markets said the deal gave Nadella ""the right product at the right time,"" as Microsoft invests in its Xbox strategy and moves into the intensely competitive mobile phone sector with Nokia under its hood.Just five years old, Mojang was co-founded by Markus Persson, who developed the hit Minecraft game after previously working at Sweden's King Digital Entertainment Plc, maker of the Candy Crush Saga game. NOT ABOUT THE MONEY News of the Microsoft deal surprised some Minecraft players who know Persson, or ""Notch"" as he is commonly known, more for his anti-big business stance. But he explained the reasons behind the deal in a blog shortly after the deal was announced.""As soon as this deal is finalized, I will leave Mojang and go back to doing Ludum Dares and small web experiments. If I ever accidentally make something that seems to gain traction, I'll probably abandon it immediately,"" Persson said in the blog posted on his Twitter feed.""I love you. All of you. Thank you for turning Minecraft into what it has become, but there are too many of you, and I can't be responsible for something this big,"" he said. ""It's not about the money. It's about my sanity."" Notch, 35, owns 71 percent of Mojang through his company Notch Development AB and stands to become a billionaire if the deal goes through. JP Morgan was the sole advisor to Mojang on the sale.Analysts have said Microsoft's purchase of Mojang is more aimed at pulling users onto its obscure mobile platform than its better known PC system or Xbox game console.Minecraft was launched as a PC game, but about 40 percent of copies are downloaded onto phones and tablets.In accounting terms, Microsoft expects the acquisition, which should close late in 2014, will break even in its current 2015 fiscal year.A $2.5 billion deal for Mojang, or about 8 times sales last year, is small change for Microsoft, which has $86 billion in cash and short-term investments. But it is relatively large and expensive for game company acquisitions.Japan's SoftBank Corp paid $1.53 billion for a 50 percent stake in Finland's Supercell last year at about 3.5 times projected annual sales. Electronic Arts Inc's (EA)  $750 million acquisition of PopCap in 2011 was valued at around 10 to 11 times sales.The Nordic region, also home to Angry Birds maker Rovio, has emerged as an important player in the gaming world, thanks to its long, dark winters and highly connected societies.EA snapped up Swedish video game maker DICE, best known for the Battlefield franchise, in 2006, and the sale of Mojang comes hard on the heels of King's listing on the New York Stock Exchange earlier this year.""It's another acknowledgement of the Swedish games industry and the technology that we produce, that a company like Microsoft wants to invest enormous amounts here,"" said Per Stromback, spokesman for the Swedish Games Industry.

The other said Nasdaq executives believed that Alibaba decided that the possibility of a botched IPO, however small, outweighed the possible benefits of being in the index.Alibaba and NYSE declined to comment, while a spokesman for Nasdaq, which has repeatedly said it has fixed the issues that went wrong in the Facebook IPO, said ""It was a close race, and we wish Alibaba well.""Alibaba's misgivings about Nasdaq's technology, two years after Facebook's glitch-ridden, $16 billion market debut, show the incident continues to threaten Nasdaq's reputation.

Performers have said using their stage names on social media protects them from possible retribution from other employers, family members and stalkers. In addition, many see their stage name as an integral part of their identity. ""I have been Heklina for 20 years, and I have Facebook telling me Heklina does not exist. So they're basically wiping you out of existence,"" a performer who goes by the name Heklina at the conference.Facebook said it would give users two weeks to adjust their profiles to display their real name or convert their personal pages into a fan page that allows for the use of nicknames.

415,"   By Alexei Oreskovic and Ross Kerber | SAN FRANCISCO/BOSTON  SAN FRANCISCO/BOSTON Alibaba Group Holding Ltd’s upcoming public offering will give Yahoo Inc billions of dollars for a potential shopping spree that investors hope will jumpstart its comeback.But with numerous holes to fill and soaring tech company valuations, Yahoo will have to make tough choices with any acquisitions.Yahoo is expected to sell about $9.5 billion in stock of the Chinese e-commerce company. After giving at least half back to investors and paying taxes, Yahoo's cash stockpile, currently $4.2 billion, may swell by $3.1 billion. That is not a lot in Silicon Valley these days. “They are not in a position to make huge acquisitions,” said Jean Yu, assistant portfolio manager of the $2.8 billion ClearBridge Value Trust fund, which owns Yahoo shares. Yu expects the new proceeds to be used for deals around several hundred million dollars each. Yahoo’s revenue growth has stalled in recent years as its once-hot Web portal and email service have lagged rivals. Key areas in need of repair include Yahoo's mobile offerings and an advertising system that doesn't deliver the precise targeting available from rivals like Google Inc and Facebook Inc, investors say. Yahoo is not one of the first three or four places that consumers go to on their mobile phone, said Bill Tai, partner emeritus at venture capital firm CRV.“All the momentum right now is shifting rapidly to mobile,"" said Tai. Chief Executive Marissa Mayer has more than doubled monthly mobile users to 450 million since taking the helm two years ago. She revamped the line-up of mobile apps by making small acquisitions that brought in teams of mobile engineers. That may be the path forward, too, since many of the best-known mobile properties are out of Yahoo's financial reach. Messaging service Snapchat, for instance, was recently valued at close to $10 billion, according to the Wall Street Journal.Online review site Yelp Inc is a long-rumored Yahoo acquisition target that could help Yahoo expand into new ""transactional"" businesses, such as restaurant food deliveries from which Yahoo would receive fees. But with a $5.5 billion market cap, Yelp would represent a huge acquisition for Yahoo that might not go over well with investors.  Yahoo was not immediately available for comment.  Some argue that Yahoo could get more bang for its buck by focusing its acquisitions on advertising technology, a sector where prices are not as rich.Publicly-listed ad tech companies such as The Rubicon Project Inc, YuMe Inc and Tubemogul Inc all have market values of roughly $400 million or less, while the privately-owned AppNexus was valued at $1.2 billion in its most recent funding round. Advertising also could deliver an immediate jolt of revenue, said Pivotal Research Group's Brian Wieser. ""The good news about ad tech is there are a lot of real businesses.""

418,"   By Herbert Lash | NEW YORK  NEW YORK The New York Stock Exchange tested its trading systems over the summer to make sure Alibaba Group Holding Ltd's (BABA.N) market debut on Friday goes without a hitch, after the Chinese e-commerce company's initial public offering raised $21.8 billion.Alibaba chose the NYSE over rival exchange operator Nasdaq OMX Group Inc (NDAQ.O) to list its shares in part because it worried about Nasdaq's ability to handle a massive IPO after Facebook Inc's (FB.O) botched market debut in 2012, sources have previously said. Nasdaq systems buckled under the tremendous volume of orders for Facebook's stock, leading to hours of delay and losses to investors. In a bid to avoid any glitch from marring Alibaba's market debut, the NYSE conducted two mock trading sessions to ensure brokers are able to connect to its systems and do everything they normally do during daily trading, said David Ethridge, who is in charge of IPOs at the NYSE, a unit of Intercontinental Exchange Inc (ICE.N).The exercises, held for a few hours on the afternoons of July 12 and Sept. 6, both Saturdays, allowed brokers to test their messaging systems, which transmit their orders and receive the all-important confirmation messages that wreaked havoc on Nasdaq's system.""It's really about orders and message traffic,"" said Ethridge, who traveled to China before and after Alibaba chose the iconic Big Board as its listing venue. Customers could ask all the questions they need answered so that ""we all feel good going into this thing.""The NYSE also plans to hold a conference call at 8:30 a.m. (1230 GMT) to provide operational updates to members of the trading, technology and operations segments of the industry.  Alibaba's shares priced at $68 per share, at the top end of the range, on Thursday, valuing the company at $167.6 billion. Its shares are expected to start trading some time after the market opens on Friday. It could be the largest-ever initial public offering if underwriters exercise an option to sell more shares, as many expect. Alibaba, which was founded 15 years ago in former English teacher Jack Ma's one-bedroom apartment, is responsible for 80 percent of online sales in China. As a result, investors, eager to buy into China's rapid growth and evolving Internet sector, have been clamoring to get shares. NYSE's testing comes after a series of glitches in recent years roiled markets and weighed on investor confidence, placing a bigger focus on operational risk by both regulators and market participants. Market operators have been testing their systems to ensure order routing systems function properly. Nasdaq, for example, has said it responded to Facebook by putting extra safeguards in place, creating new positions within the company to improve communications with the industry and regulators when errors occur, and establishing an engineering team to monitor and analyze daily performance. TWITTER MODEL NYSE often conducts systems testing during the weekends, but it was only last October, ahead of Twitter Inc's (TWTR.N) market debut, that it opened up for an IPO simulation requested by member firms, many of which participated in Facebook's IPO. ""We did it for Twitter, in response to another transaction that had caused people to be somewhat uncomfortable,"" Ethridge said. ""That got everybody comfortable on Twitter going into it, and it went fine.""Still, each IPO is different because of the number of shares offered and the make-up of demand in the after-market, when investors who were unable to completely fill their order book before initial trading begins must enter the market. Estimating the number of sellers also is important to ensure a successful market debut.  Ethridge said after the pricing, a lengthy process of allocating shares to all the parties that agreed to take part in the IPO begins. It can go into the wee hours as underwriters divvy up shares among investors.To ensure trading at the open of the IPO and during the day goes smoothly, the NYSE will work with a so-called stabilization agent, which is Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) in Alibaba's case, Ethridge said. Goldman will determine when to open trading in Alibaba and at what price, and will manage the flow of orders.General Motors Co's (GM.N) shares started trading about 10 minutes after market open in their debut, while Twitter took about 70 minutes to open. Every IPO is different, Ethridge said.

Nasdaq, for example, has said it responded to Facebook by putting extra safeguards in place, creating new positions within the company to improve communications with the industry and regulators when errors occur, and establishing an engineering team to monitor and analyze daily performance.TWITTER MODEL  NYSE often conducts systems testing during the weekends, but it was only last October, ahead of Twitter Inc's market debut, that it opened up for an IPO simulation requested by member firms, many of which participated in Facebook's IPO.""We did it for Twitter, in response to another transaction that had caused people to be somewhat uncomfortable,"" Ethridge said. ""That got everybody comfortable on Twitter going into it, and it went fine.""Still, each IPO is different because of the number of shares offered and the make-up of demand in the after-market, when investors who were unable to completely fill their order book before initial trading begins must enter the market. Estimating the number of sellers also is important to ensure a successful market debut.Ethridge said after the pricing, a lengthy process of allocating shares to all the parties that agreed to take part in the IPO begins. It can go into the wee hours as underwriters divvy up shares among investors.To ensure trading at the open of the IPO and during the day goes smoothly, the NYSE will work with a so-called stabilization agent, which is Goldman Sachs Group Inc in Alibaba's case, Ethridge said. Goldman will determine when to open trading in Alibaba and at what price, and will manage the flow of orders.General Motors Co's shares started trading about 10 minutes after market open in their debut, while Twitter took about 70 minutes to open. Every IPO is different, Ethridge said.

422,"  Facebook Inc is set to unveil a new advertising platform to improve effectiveness of online ads, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday citing people with knowledge of the matter.The product is a redesigned version of Atlas Advertiser Suite, an ad management and measurement platform that Facebook bought from Microsoft Corp last year.It is expected to help marketers target Facebook users more effectively by measuring which users have seen, interacted or acted upon ads that appear on Facebook's services and on third-party websites and apps. The product will also provide a tool for marketers to buy ads to target Facebook users across the Web. Microsoft took on Atlas with its $6.3 billion acquisition of digital ad agency aQuantive in 2007. Unable to make it work for its own purposes, Microsoft wrote off $6.2 billion of the aQuantive deal's value in 2012.The world's No.1 Internet social network, which lags behind market leader Google Inc in U.S. market for online display ads, did not reveal how much it paid for the technology. Facebook counts 1.5 million advertising customers and the company's ad business saw strong growth across all of its geographic regions, Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg told Reuters in July.  Mobile advertising revenue grew 151 percent year-over-year, accounting for roughly 62 percent of Facebook's overall ad revenue in the second quarter.

423,"   By Piya Sinha-Roy and Lisa Richwine | LOS ANGELES, Sept 23  LOS ANGELES, Sept 23 A Tyrannosaurus rex lumbers forward, belts out a deafening roar, then stomps overhead, and a viewer watching inside a virtual reality headset turns around to see the beast walking away.The lifelike run-in with a prehistoric monster comes courtesy of prototype Oculus Rift goggles, giving a glimpse of  a future that breaks movies out of the flat screen.Virtual reality, which immerses viewers in 360-degree worlds long used in video games, is drawing top Hollywood filmmakers and studios such as Twenty-First Century Fox and Walt Disney Co. The technology should arrive on the consumer mass market within two years.Virtual reality can transport audiences into the middle of the movie landscape, says Brendan Iribe, chief executive of Oculus, which Facebook Inc acquired this year for $2 billion.""In some decade or two, we are going to be at a point where watching things on 2D surfaces is going to feel pretty outdated,"" Iribe told Reuters.Virtual reality still has technological hurdles to overcome. The biggest problem is motion sickness in some users, which Oculus believes it is close to resolving.Hollywood directors are trying to figure out how to create 360-degree scenes, and it remains unclear if audiences will want to spend two hours in a virtual world, or just visit for shorter experiences. BABY STEPS FOR BIGGER SCREENS Iribe has big ambitions for Oculus Rift devices, the latest version unveiled at a developers conference on Saturday in Hollywood. A prototype is sold now to developers for $350 per headset.With a consumer version on the horizon, Iribe believes virtual reality devices could be in the hands of millions of consumers within a couple of years.Designers at Disney's Lucasfilm are playing around on the desert planet Tatooine, exploring how to bring virtual reality to the ""Star Wars"" universe as the studio prepares to release Episode VII of the film franchise in 2015. ""Lucasfilm absolutely thinks this is a phenomenal space to be in,"" said John Gaeta, Lucasfilm's Oscar-winning creative director of new media and experiences.To take smaller steps toward bigger screens, digital projection company Barco is introducing Barco Escape, a 270-degree panoramic screen, in movie theaters. The three-piece screen expands to the left and right of the theater walls.Fox is currently testing Barco Escape in select Cinemark theaters with young adult thriller ""The Maze Runner"",  where scenes were extended onto the expanded screens using computer-generated digital imagery.""Maze Runner"" director Wes Ball said the extended screens were intended to immerse viewers in the visually expanded world of the film, without detracting from the central screen. 'PLACES NOBODY HAS GONE' The bigger screens will attract younger audiences, especially those used to the bigger screens in video games, said Barco's ""cinemavangelist"" Ted Schilowitz. He is also Fox's resident ""Futurist,"" developing projects in a virtual reality bunker on the studio's Los Angeles lot. Disney's Pixar Animation Studios is also testing Barco Escape.Schilowitz calls Barco Escape the ""bricks and mortar version"" of virtual reality and films adapted to the 270-degree screen format can work on Oculus Rift.""This is the average consumer's entry point to what a more immersive experience feels like,"" he said.Oscar-nominated filmmaker Guillermo Del Toro, an early adopter of new technology in film, presented an Oculus Rift game based on 2013's ""Pacific Rim"" at San Diego's Comic-Con in July. But Del Toro told Reuters ""it will be hard to direct (a movie) because you have to show the audience what to see"" when viewers can look anywhere.But Robert Stromberg is undeterred. The Oscar-winning production designer of 2009's ""Avatar"" and director of Disney blockbuster ""Maleficent"" now splits his time between traditional filmmaking and virtual reality storytelling, developing content for Oculus devices.""I'm really trying to see how the two can marry together,"" he said. ""I love the pioneering aspects. There is a thrill and an excitement to going in those places nobody has gone before.""

425,"   By Foo Yun Chee | BRUSSELS  BRUSSELS Facebook (FB.O), the world's leading social network, will win unconditional EU approval for its $19 billion offer for mobile messaging startup WhatsApp in a deal pitting it against telecoms operators, two people familiar with the matter said on Thursday.The landmark acquisition, the largest in Facebook's 10-year history, will give the company a firm foothold in the fast-growing mobile messaging market.A plan by WhatsApp to add free voice-call services for its 450 million customers later this year, however, makes it a potentially powerful competitor to companies such as Deutsche Telekom (DTEGn.DE), Telecom Italia (TLIT.MI) and Telefonica (TEF.MC).Analysts said the move is likely to hit telecoms providers' turnover as the industry heads into its fifth year of revenue decline. The sector had looked to EU regulators to extract concessions from Facebook.Facebook convinced the Commission that the deal had no anti-competitive effect and, therefore, concessions were not necessary, the sources said. ""It's unconditional clearance,"" one of the people said, declining to be named because the decision by the European Commission was not yet public.Commission spokesman Antoine Colombani declined to comment. The European Union competition authority has set an Oct. 3 deadline for its decision. The deal does not seem to pose any competition problems as far as the Commission is concerned, said Tobias Caspary, a partner at law firm Fried Frank.""Both parties are offering their services for free. It seems unlikely that customers are locked in with respect to instant messaging, and it would be relatively easy to switch to alternative offers, for example Skype or Line,"" he said.""Also relevant factors looked at were probably that the entry barriers are relatively low for the instant messaging market, that this is still a nascent market characterized by rapid changes and growth, and that there are several recent entrants.""        U.S. regulators gave the green light for the deal in April, telling WhatsApp to stick to its current privacy practices after the merger, including not to use users' personal data for targeted ads.WhatsApp and its rivals such as KakaoTalk, China's WeChat and Viber have in recent years won over telecoms operators' customers with a free text messaging option, posing a serious threat to the sector's revenues from this business, which totaled about $120 billion last year, according to market researcher Ovum.

436,"   By Christina  Farr and Alexei Oreskovic | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Facebook Inc (FB.O) already knows who your friends are and the kind of things that grab your attention. Soon, it could also know the state of your health. On the heels of fellow Silicon Valley technology companies Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Google Inc (GOOGL.O), Facebook is plotting its first steps into the fertile field of healthcare, said three people familiar with the matter. The people requested anonymity as the plans are still in development. The company is exploring creating online ""support communities"" that would connect Facebook users suffering from various ailments. A small team is also considering new ""preventative care"" applications that would help people improve their lifestyles. In recent months, the sources said, the social networking giant has been holding meetings with medical industry experts and entrepreneurs, and is setting up a research and development unit to test new health apps. Facebook is still in the idea-gathering stage, the people said.Healthcare has historically been an area of interest for Facebook, but it has taken a backseat to more pressing products.Recently, Facebook executives have come to realize that healthcare might work as a tool to increase engagement with the site. One catalyst: the unexpected success of Facebook's ""organ-donor status initiative,"" introduced in 2012. The day that Facebook altered profile pages to allow members to specify their organ donor-status, 13,054 people registered to be organ donors online in the United States, a 21 fold increase over the daily average of 616 registrations, according to a June 2013 study published in the American Journal of Transplantation. Separately, Facebook product teams noticed that people with chronic ailments such as diabetes would search the social networking site for advice, said one former Facebook insider. In addition, the proliferation of patient networks such as PatientsLikeMe demonstrate that people are increasingly comfortable sharing symptoms and treatment experiences online. Chief executive Mark Zuckerberg may step up his personal involvement in health. Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan, a pediatric resident at University of California San Francisco, recently donated $5 million to the Ravenswood Health Center in East Palo Alto. Any advertising built around the health initiatives would not be as targeted as it could be on television or other media. Pharmaceutical companies, for instance, are prohibited from using Facebook to promote the sale of prescription drugs, in part because of concerns surrounding disclosures.  PRIVACY CONCERNS  Privacy, an area where the company has faced considerable criticism over the years, will likely prove a challenge. This week, the company apologized to users for manipulating news feeds for the purposes of research. But Facebook may already have a few ideas to alleviate privacy concerns around its health initiatives. The company is considering rolling out its first health application quietly and under a different name, a source said. Market research commissioned by Facebook found that many of its users were unaware that photo-service Instagram is Facebook-owned, the source said. Facebook's recent softening of its policy requiring users to go by their real names may also bolster the company's health plans. People with chronic conditions may prefer to use an alias when sharing their health experiences.     ""I could see Facebook doing well with applications for lifestyle and wellness, but really sick patients with conditions like cancer aren't fooling around,"" said Frank Williams, chief executive of Evolent Health, a company that provides software and services to doctors and health systems.People would need anonymity and an assurance that their data and comments wouldn't be shared with their online contacts, advertisers, or pharmaceutical companies, Williams said. It remains unclear whether Facebook will moderate or curate the content shared in the support communities, or bring in outside medical experts to provide context.Facebook declined to comment on its health care plans.

Snapchat, a privately owned mobile app that allows users to swap photos that can disappear after a few seconds, is raising money at a $10 billion valuation, according to media reports. Facebook paid $4.59 billion in cash and 178 million shares of its stock for WhatsApp, as well 46 million of grants in restricted stock units for WhatsApp employees that will vest over a four year period.

453,"   By Jonathan Stempel | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Facebook Inc and Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg have sued several lawyers who represented Paul Ceglia, claiming they helped the upstate New York entrepreneur pursue a fraudulent lawsuit to extort a 50 percent stake in the social networking company.Monday's lawsuit was filed seven months after a federal judge dismissed Ceglia's civil case and two years after federal prosecutors in Manhattan charged Ceglia with criminal mail and wire fraud for alleged document forgery. Facebook's market value is now about $200 billion.Ceglia, a wood pellet salesman from Wellsville, New York, is not a defendant in Facebook's lawsuit, which was filed with the New York state court in Manhattan.The 13 defendants include DLA Piper, one of the world's largest law firms; Paul Argentieri, Ceglia's original lawyer; the law firms Milberg LLP and Lippes Mathias Wexler Friedman; and Dennis Vacco, a Lippes Mathias partner and former New York attorney general.Facebook seeks unspecified damages for harm to its reputation and business, which it wants tripled because of the lawyers' alleged misconduct, plus punitive damages.""We said from the beginning that Paul Ceglia's claim was a fraud and that we would seek to hold those responsible accountable,"" Facebook general counsel Colin Stretch said in a statement. Peter Pantaleo, DLA Piper's general counsel, in a statement said Facebook sued ""to intimidate lawyers"" to refrain from suing the Menlo Park, California-based company. ""We will defend this meritless litigation aggressively and we will prevail.""Vacco made similar claims in another statement, and said his firm's lawyers ""operated completely within the rule of law and at the highest ethical standards at all times.""The other defendants did not respond to requests for comment. Ceglia claimed in his June 2010 lawsuit that an April 2003 contract he signed with Zuckerberg, who was then a Harvard University freshman who had done programming work for Ceglia's StreetFax.com, entitled him to a Facebook stake as high as 84 percent. Facebook said Ceglia's lawyers knew or should have known this lawsuit was a fraud, having been ""based on an implausible story and obviously forged documents,"" but plowed ahead ""for the purpose of extorting a lucrative and unwarranted settlement.""It also said those lawyers stayed with the case even after Aaron Marks, a lawyer at Kasowitz Benson Torres & Friedman who also represented Ceglia, warned that he had found ""smoking-gun"" evidence of fraud. While the Kasowitz firm withdrew from the case, Marks agreed not to report the ""misconduct"" he had found to the court at the request of another of Ceglia's law firms, the complaint said. The Kasowitz firm and Marks were not named as defendants.Ceglia's criminal trial is scheduled for May 4, 2015. He has pleaded not guilty.The case is Facebook Inc et al v.

The cost of a Facebook straddle, in which an investor buys an at-the-money put option and a similar call option, suggests a move of about 7 percent in either direction by Oct. 31.That is short of the average move of about 10 percent in Facebook shares the day after the company reported results in the last eight quarters. The stock jumped as much as 14 percent in January, and nearly 30 percent in July last year when the company posted strong mobile advertising revenue.Given that average, the price of the straddle seems cheap, WhatsTrading.com options strategist Fred Ruffy said. Facebook's last two earnings reports showed growing strength in its mobile advertising business and have helped push the company's shares up nearly 31 percent over the last six months. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 3.5 percent over that period.On Tuesday, Facebook investors will be looking for continuing signs that mobile ads are translating into revenue, to gauge if the company can keep up its recent momentum, said Baird Equity Research analyst Colin Sebastian.Facebook was the second busiest name in the options market on Thursday, with 191,000 calls and 153,000 puts traded, according to Livevol Inc data. Ophir Gottlieb, chief executive of Los Angeles-based Capital Market Laboratories LLC, argues that the relatively calm expectations for Facebook leaves the market exposed in case of a disappointment.

456,"   By Alexei Oreskovic | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Facebook Inc warned on Tuesday of a dramatic increase in spending in 2015 and projected a slowdown in revenue growth this quarter, slicing a tenth off its market value.The hefty spending plans exposed the first signs of stress in the rock-solid support that investors have accorded the social networking company over the past year. With Facebook's mobile advertising business delivering repeated quarters of breakneck revenue growth, the company has faced little pushback from investors on pricey, multi-billion dollar acquisitions such as WhatsApp and Oculus. Shares of Facebook reached an all-time high of $81.16 on Tuesday, before the company reported its third-quarter results. Chief Financial Officer Dave Wehner told analysts on a conference call that the social network is preparing for a 55 percent to 75 percent spike in expenses next year, when the world's largest social network intends to invest in Whatsapp, Oculus and other products that have yet to show a profit.That's a big change from the company's current spending patterns, with costs and expenses in the first nine months of 2013 up a relatively modest 32 percent. Facebook declined to provide any estimates for its expected pace of revenue growth in 2015, adding to investor worries. ""Giving expense guidance without giving revenue guidance is frustrating and spooking The Street,"" said BTIG analyst Richard Greenfield. ""The multi-billion dollar question is what’s revenue growth going to look like next year,"" he said. Wehner forecast revenue growth of 40 percent to 47 percent in the final quarter of 2014. That's down sharply from 59 percent in the third quarter. The financial forecasts came on the same day as Facebook revealed hundreds of millions of dollars in losses from WhatsApp. Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg has told Wall Street he is in no hurry to extract a payoff from the collection of acquired products, stressing the importance of growing the number of users first. ""For us products don’t get that interesting until they have about a billion people using them,"" Zuckerberg said.Shares of Facebook, up roughly 47 percent this year, slid nearly 9 percent to $73.80 in extended trading on Tuesday. MOBILE SURGE Facebook reported a better-than-expected 59 percent jump in third-quarter revenue and a solid gain in its user base that's already the world's largest social media community. The company is considered a pioneer in mobile advertising, outshining rivals like Twitter Inc, which are struggling to sustain user engagement and growth.Google Inc, the world's No.1 Internet search engine, has seen its advertising rates stuck in a multi-year decline as it adapts its lucrative advertising business for the smartphones that consumers increasingly favor. Mobile ads represented two-thirds of Facebook's advertising revenue in the third quarter, and the company said that the average price of its ads more than tripled year-on-year. ""They continue to show that there is a lot of demand for their product, both in terms of users wanting to spend time there and advertisers wanting to spend money,"" said Ben Schachter an analyst with Macquarie Research. Facebook's total number of monthly users reached 1.35 billion in the third quarter, with 64 percent of its users accessing the service every day.Facebook said revenue in the three months ended Sept. 30 totaled $3.2 billion, up 59 percent from $2.02 billion in the year-ago period. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S were looking for revenue of $3.12 billion on average.Net income increased to $806 million, or 30 cents a share in the third quarter, compared to $425 million, or 17 cents a share in the year-ago period. Excluding certain items, Facebook said it earned 43 cents a share. Facebook also for the first time disclosed the financial performance for WhatsApp, a mobile messaging app that the company acquired earlier this month for $22 billion. According to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday, WhatsApp lost $232.5 million in the first six months of 2014, compared to a loss of $58.8 million in the first six months of 2013.

Shares of Facebook reached an all-time high of $81.16 on Tuesday, before the company reported its third-quarter results.Chief Financial Officer Dave Wehner told analysts on a conference call that the social network is preparing for a 55 percent to 75 percent spike in expenses next year, when the world's largest social network intends to invest in Whatsapp, Oculus and other products that have yet to show a profit.That's a big change from the company's current spending patterns, with costs and expenses in the first nine months of 2013 up a relatively modest 32 percent. Facebook declined to provide any estimates for its expected pace of revenue growth in 2015, adding to investor worries.""Giving expense guidance without giving revenue guidance is frustrating and spooking The Street,"" said BTIG analyst Richard Greenfield.""The multi-billion dollar question is what's revenue growth going to look like next year,"" he said. Wehner forecast revenue growth of 40 percent to 47 percent in the final quarter of 2014. That's down sharply from 59 percent in the third quarter.The financial forecasts came on the same day as Facebook revealed hundreds of millions of dollars in losses from WhatsApp.Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg has told Wall Street he is in no hurry to extract a payoff from the collection of acquired products, stressing the importance of growing the number of users first.""For us products don't get that interesting until they have about a billion people using them,"" Zuckerberg said. Shares of Facebook, up roughly 47 percent this year, slid nearly 9 percent to $73.80 in extended trading on Tuesday.MOBILE SURGE Facebook reported a better-than-expected 59 percent jump in third-quarter revenue and a solid gain in its user base that's already the world's largest social media community. The company is considered a pioneer in mobile advertising, outshining rivals like Twitter Inc, which are struggling to sustain user engagement and growth. Google Inc, the world's No.1 Internet search engine, has seen its advertising rates stuck in a multi-year decline as it adapts its lucrative advertising business for the smartphones that consumers increasingly favor.Mobile ads represented two-thirds of Facebook's advertising revenue in the third quarter, and the company said that the average price of its ads more than tripled year-on-year.""They continue to show that there is a lot of demand for their product, both in terms of users wanting to spend time there and advertisers wanting to spend money,"" said Ben Schachter an analyst with Macquarie Research.Facebook's total number of monthly users reached 1.35 billion in the third quarter, with 64 percent of its users accessing the service every day.Facebook said revenue in the three months ended Sept. 30 totaled $3.2 billion, up 59 percent from $2.02 billion in the year-ago period. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S were looking for revenue of $3.12 billion on average.Net income increased to $806 million, or 30 cents a share in the third quarter, compared to $425 million, or 17 cents a share in the year-ago period. Excluding certain items, Facebook said it earned 43 cents a share.Facebook also for the first time disclosed the financial performance for WhatsApp, a mobile messaging app that the company acquired earlier this month for $22 billion.According to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday, WhatsApp lost $232.5 million in the first six months of 2014, compared to a loss of $58.8 million in the first six months of 2013.

Energy stocks were the day's biggest gainers, up 2.2 percent, while the Philadelphia SE Oil Service index gained 3.4 percent. Adding to the day's positive tone was consumer confidence data, which hit its highest since 2007 in October. The report overshadowed a separate read that showed new orders for capital goods by U.S. businesses fell the most in eight months in September.Amgen Inc climbed 6.1 percent to $157.19, among the top boosts for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, a day after its 2015 outlook topped expectations. The Nasdaq Biotech index rose 1.3 percent.The majority of U.S. companies reporting third-quarter results have beaten analysts' expectations so far, easing some worries about the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar and weak global demand. ""We haven't seen big global companies downgrade their outlooks because of the stronger dollar or anything else, so earnings coming in so strong has been a relief,"" said Channing Smith, co-portfolio manager of capital advisors growth fund at Capital Advisors in Tulsa, Oklahoma.There have been some high-profile earnings disappointments. Twitter Inc fell 9.8 percent to $43.78 after it posted a slide in a closely watched measure of engagement, even as its user base grew in the third quarter.The Dow Jones industrial average rose 187.81 points, or 1.12 percent, to 17,005.75, the S&P 500 gained 23.42 points, or 1.19 percent, to 1,985.05 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 78.36 points, or 1.75 percent, to 4,564.29. With the day's advance, the S&P 500 ended above its 50-day moving average for the first time since Sept. 29, a sign that momentum is turning more positive. The Russell 2000  jumped 2.7 percent and traded above its 200-day moving average for the first time since Sept. 19.After the market closed, Facebook Inc posted revenue growth of almost 60 percent. Shares were little changed in after-hours trading.Investors were awaiting clues on the outlook for the U.S. economy from the Federal Reserve as the central bank commenced a two-day policy meeting. It is likely to reinforce expectations it will wait a long while before rising interest rates, although the Fed is all but certain to announce the end of its massive bond-buying stimulus.Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by 2,582 to 501, for a 5.15-to-1 ratio on the upside; on the Nasdaq, 2,171 issues rose and 526 fell for a 4.13-to-1 ratio.The benchmark S&P 500 index posted 64 new 52-week highs and 2 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 133 new highs and 36 new lows.About 6.17 billion shares traded on all U.S. platforms, according to BATS exchange data, below the month-to-date average of 7.92 billion.

460,"   By Tenzin Pema and Supantha Mukherjee  Another day, another quarterly report from a technology company that disappointed investors.Facebook Inc's shares fell as much as 7.4 percent to  $74.78 in early trading on Wednesday, a day after the company revealed aggressive spending plans for 2015. But analysts were taking a more upbeat view, saying the heavy spending will drive long-term growth and reinforce the social networking giant's market dominance.No brokerages cut their recommendation on the company following the release of its third-quarter results, and several said the price decline represented a buying opportunity.At least 15 brokerages cut their price targets on the stock, by as much as $8 to as low as $78, mainly to reflect the company's expense and revenue outlook.""FB delivered another strong quarter and is very well-positioned in an increasingly mobile and social internet landscape, and to be clear, FB is investing into strength and future growth opportunities,"" JP Morgan Securities analysts said in a research note. JP Morgan rates Facebook ""overweight"", with a price target of $85, down from $90.Of 44 analysts covering the stock, 15 rate it a ""strong buy,"" 22 a ""buy"" and seven a ""hold."" Nobody rates the stock a ""sell"", according to Thomson Reuters data. The drop in Facebook's share price follows a now-familiar script this corporate reporting season.Shares of Amazon.com Inc, eBay Inc, Google Inc and Netflix Inc also fell after the companies failed to live up to investor expectations.In most cases, their shares have recovered.""We have already seen relatively rapid share price recoveries post Q3 EPS corrections – AMZN up 4 percent, EBAY and GOOGL up 7 percent, NFLX up 16 percent – so this market is buying beaten-down Net stocks,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney, who has an ""outperform"" rating on the stock, wrote in a note.  SPENDING BIG Facebook, which reported stronger-than-expected quarterly revenue, projected a 55-75 percent increase in spending in 2015 for investments that will eat into its near-term profit.The company's costs and expenses rose 32 percent in the first nine months of the year. ""Comparable investment of the scale that Facebook is contemplating can only be achieved by them or by Google... We see further investment reinforcing their relative dominance in digital advertising for years to come,"" Pivotal Research analysts said in a report, maintaining a ""buy"" rating. Facebook has spent billions of dollars to buy fast-growing companies such as WhatsApp, Instagram and Oculus as it tries to boost its reach, especially among the young.Piper Jaffray's Gene Munster, who has an ""overweight"" call on the stock, said that while spending would hurt earnings in the short term, Facebook's broad product portfolio would start to benefit the business over the next six to eight quarters.Up to Tuesday's close, Facebook's shares had risen almost 50 percent since the start of the year.""While the shares aren't exactly 'for sale' we are buyers of this dip,"" RBC's Mahaney said.

It also signaled confidence the U.S. economic recovery would remain on track despite signs of a slowdown in many parts of the global economy. ""The Fed's announcement is exactly what everyone expected.

In a typical quarter since 1994, 63 percent of companies beat estimates.* Facebook shares fell 7.7 percent in premarket trading the day after the social network announced an increase in spending in 2015 and projected a slowdown in revenue growth this quarter. * Orbital Sciences Corp shares fell 13.7 percent in light volume the day after its unmanned rocket exploded seconds after liftoff from a commercial launch pad in Virginia, marking the first accident since NASA turned to private operators to deliver cargo to the International Space Station.Futures snapshot at 07:19 EDT (1119 GMT): * S&P 500 e-minis were falling 3.25 points, or 0.16 percent, with 130,394 contracts changing hands.* Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 10.5 points, or 0.26 percent, in volume of 25,600 contracts.* Dow e-minis were down 9 points, or 0.05 percent, with 16,783 contracts changing hands.

Japan's Nikkei share average  also posted a sizable 1.5 percent increase.European shares are expected to follow suit, with spreadbetters looking to gains of up to 0.4 percent in Germany's DAX and Britain's FTSE. U.S. stocks rose more than 1 percent on Tuesday, with the S&P 500 coming less than two percent below its record peak set last month.The Fed is widely expected to announce on Wednesday it will end its two-year-old bond-buying stimulus, known as quantitative easing three, as the U.S. economy continues to gather momentum.Still Fed officials have also stressed they are in no hurry to take policy tightening a step further by raising rates from near zero levels due to subdued inflation and the poor quality of a recovery in labour markets.""There are some views that the tapering process could be delayed to run through the rest of this year, but it is more likely that the Fed will maintain its current stance of exercising prudence in consideration of any rate hike,"" said Lim Dong-rak, an analyst at Hanyang Securities. Upbeat U.S. earnings so far have also eased worries that corporate profits might be squeezed by sluggish global growth.With 245 companies in the S&P 500 having reported earnings so far for the third quarter, 73.5 percent have beat analyst expectations, according to Thomson Reuters. Over the past four quarters, 67 percent of companies have beat estimates.Still, Facebook Inc shocked investors after the market close on Tuesday, warning of a dramatic increase in spending in 2015 and projected a slowdown in revenue growth this quarter, falling 8.2 percent in after hours trading.U.S. economic data published on Tuesday was mixed. But a rise in consumer confidence to a seven-year high gave stock bulls enough reason to maintain their optimism on the economic recovery. Separate data showed new orders for capital goods by U.S. businesses fell the most in eight months in September.The data dented the U.S. dollar against a broad range of currencies.The euro rose to a one-week high of $1.2765 on Tuesday and last stood at $1.2738 in Asian trade. The Canadian dollar climbed to its highest level in more than two weeks against the U.S. dollar of C$1.1165.The dollar held firmer against the yen, however, as the Japanese currency was held back by speculation that the Bank of Japan will revise down its economic growth forecast in its economic report on Friday.The dollar traded at 108.18 yen, not far from a two-week high of 108.36 yen hit last week. It had a muted reaction to data showing Japanese industrial output  rose 2.7 percent in September, slightly above market expectations.Meanwhile, the Swedish crown managed to stabilise after sliding to four-year lows on Tuesday, knocked by a surprisingly dovish message from Sweden's central bank.The Riksbank cut interest rates more than expected to zero and said it would delay tightening policy until the middle of 2016 as it moved decisively to tackle the risk of deflation.Overnight, one of the factors that may hold back risk sentiment is news that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security was increasing security at government buildings in Washington and other cities because of continuing terror attack threats.

But he described U.S.-China dialogue on cybersecurity as ""unhindered"", less than a week after the talks appeared to have stalled.Chinese state councillor Yang Jiechi told U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry this month that resuming cybersecurity cooperation between China and the United State would be difficult because of ""mistaken U.S. practices"".Speaking to reporters at a Beijing news conference on Thursday to publicize an Internet conference, Lu said the two countries had ""differences but also commonalities"", and he hoped they could find common ground.

472,"   By Jonathan Stempel | NEW YORK  NEW YORK A divided U.S. appeals court rejected UBS AG's UBSN.VX bid to force Nasdaq OMX Group Inc (NDAQ.O) to arbitrate a dispute over the exchange operator's alleged ""catastrophic mismanagement"" of Facebook Inc's (FB.O) $16 billion initial public offering.The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York on Friday said UBS' agreement with Nasdaq to help make a market for Facebook shares did not entitle the Swiss bank to arbitration, in its effort to recoup more than $350 million of losses.Circuit Judge Reena Raggi wrote for a 2-1 majority that the agreement was subject to a Nasdaq rule that ""specifically disallows"" claims over trading losses, showing that ""the parties did not intend to submit such foreclosed claims to binding arbitration.""UBS had no immediate comment. Nasdaq spokesman Joseph Christinat declined to comment.Facebook's first day of trading on May 18, 2012 was plagued by technology problems, resulting in a delayed opening and tens of thousands of trade and cancellation orders being stuck in Nasdaq's system for more than two hours.While market makers lost an estimated $500 million on Facebook's IPO, federal regulators last year approved a plan for Nasdaq to repay only about $41.6 million.  Friday's decision may therefore make it more difficult for UBS to recoup anything close to its estimated losses.It upheld a June 2013 preliminary injunction issued by U.S. District Judge Robert Sweet barring arbitration.Nasdaq agreed in May 2013 to pay a $10 million penalty, a record for a stock exchange, to settle U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission charges over its alleged ""poor systems and decision-making"" for the IPO. The exchange operator did not admit wrongdoing. Facebook investors are also suing Nasdaq over the IPO.In its March 2013 arbitration demand, UBS claimed that Nasdaq had not been ""up to the task"" of handling such a big IPO, and was ""grossly negligent"" in allowing shares to trade despite lacking the necessary software.UBS said this resulted in many duplicate or errant orders, made it impossible to determine what trades had been made, and caused the bank to unintentionally amass a net 40.2 million Facebook shares by the end of the first trading day. Dissenting from Friday's decision, Circuit Judge Chester Straub said federal courts had no power to review UBS state law claims premised on the rules of Nasdaq, a private company. He said the majority's reasoning could flood courts with new cases.""It simply cannot be true that every time a case involves a famous company or a multibillion-dollar IPO, federal courts have jurisdiction,"" he wrote.The case is Nasdaq OMX Group Inc et al v.

482,"  (Adds Costolo's comments, details on Twitter)By Alexei OreskovicSAN FRANCISCO Nov 12 Twitter Inc is considering creating additional mobile applications beyond its core messaging service and ways of making it easier for newcomers to use its service, as it vies with Facebook Inc  and other social media for smartphone users.Shares of Twitter were up more than 6 percent at $42.14 in midday trading on Wednesday following the comments, in San Francisco at the company's first financial analyst day. Chief Executive Dick Costolo said Twitter also planned to speed up the pace of changes to its product and to add more functions to its private messaging service.""I strongly believe private messaging virality is important to our long term growth,"" Costolo said, a reference to when online content goes viral or is popularly shared. He noted that some of the new private messaging features would be introduced in the current quarter. Executives said the company needed to do a better job helping new users understand how to use the service. An upcoming ""instant timeline"" will quickly provide new users with content without requiring them to search Twitter for individual users to follow. Twitter, whose main service allows users to broadcast 140-character messages, appeared to be taking a page from rival Facebook, which in recent years has taken the approach of creating individual apps centered on news, for instance, and also recently beefed up its private messaging.Twitter has been searching for ways to arrest dwindling user engagement and drive growth. It currently counts 284 million users, compared with  Facebook's 1.3 billion.In October, Twitter reported that timeline views per user, a key measure of engagement, slid 7 percent globally in the third quarter.

485,"   By Alexei Oreskovic | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Facebook Inc's professional version of its social network aimed at businesses will launch in the next few months, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters on Monday. The world's No.1 Internet social network with 1.35 billion monthly users has been quietly testing a version of its website geared toward workplace collaboration. The service, dubbed Facebook at Work, allows users to exchange messages and share documents using Facebook's scrolling news feed and other familiar features from the consumer version of Facebook. The professional version of Facebook, which could compete with services such as LinkedIn Corp, as well as Salesforce.com Inc and Microsoft Corp, would allow users to maintain special profiles that are distinct from their existing Facebook profiles, the person said. Work activities would not be shared on a user's personal profile, and the baby photos, videos and general banter popular in the consumer version of Facebook would not encroach into the professional version. A Facebook team in London is leading the effort and a small number of companies are currently running a pilot version of the service, the person said.It is still unclear how Facebook plans to make money from the professional service. Facebook is not currently charging a subscription fee for the version being tested, according to a report in the Financial Times, which first reported news of the service. Facebook currently generates the bulk of its revenue from ads that appear on its existing service.  Shares of LinkedIn, a social network aimed at professional users, were down 5 percent at $222.12 in midday trading on Monday. Salesforce.com was down 1.74 percent at $62.80 and Microsoft was essentially flat at $49.54. Facebook shares were down 1 percent at $74.13.

491,"   By Eric M. Johnson | SEATTLE  SEATTLE The gunman in a Washington state high school cafeteria shooting last month that left five dead sent ominous text messages before the attack that detailed how to divvy up his property and what he wanted to wear in his funeral casket, court documents showed on Thursday.Also, minutes before the shooting, Jaylen Fryberg used Facebook to send another teen who was not among the victims a photo that appeared to be the handgun he would use sitting between his legs, asking the teen to have a friend ""call me before I do this.""The popular 15-year-old football player opened fire with a .40 caliber Berretta on a cafeteria gathering of his cousins and three close friends he had arranged via text message at Marysville-Pilchuck High School north of Seattle on Oct. 24.Fryberg, who shot himself, died that day along with a female victim. Two other girls and a cousin later died of their injuries in hospital. Nate Hatch, another cousin, has been released. Fragments of text messages in the days before the shooting were described by an Everett Police Department detective in a search warrant affidavit released to Reuters on Thursday.According to the affidavit, he also sent texts to a 15-year-old close friend with whom police said he had an argument on Oct. 18.Then on Oct. 22, Fryberg wrote: ""I set the date. Hopefully you regret not talking to me ... You have no idea what I'm talking about. But you will ... Bang bang I'm dead."" When that teen stopped responding, Fryberg tried to reach the person through a friend to whom he sent the picture of the handgun, the affidavit said.Fryberg's family have said there was no apparent rift between the cousins. But Fryberg had hinted in social media messages of some sort of heartbreak and anger. Also, a friend of one of the female victims as well as a school official said  Fryberg had recently been rejected by a girl.  Snohomish Multi-Agency Response Team spokeswoman Shari Ireton said it would take police weeks to determine whether family or friends could face criminal charges for not reporting Fryberg's texts.The killings marked the latest in a string of such incidents at U.S. schools, renewing a national debate about student safety and gun control.

496,"   By Kylie MacLellan | LONDON  LONDON Dec 9 Facebook is not to blame for failing to pass on information that might have prevented the murder of a British soldier last year, US ambassador to Britain Matthew Barzun said on Tuesday.Last month, a report by British lawmakers concluded that while security services could not have prevented the attack, an unspecified U.S. communications company could have led British investigators to head off the plot.The company had picked up an online exchange between one of the soldier's murderers and an overseas militant that he wanted to kill a soldier, but did not inform British spy agency MI5.   British media have reported that company was Facebook.Asked at an event in the British parliament if it was right to blame Facebook for failing to prevent the murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby, who was hacked to death in broad daylight, Barzun told reporters: ""Are you right to blame them? No."" However, Barzun said, technology companies could play a role in combating extremism.""I don't think it is fair to pin everything on the private sector, nor is it fair to say that they have no responsibility in trying to come up with solutions,"" he said.Barzun also said large U.S. companies such as Google  and Amazon, which have been accused of using complex accounting schemes to cut their payments on earnings in Britain, were not international tax dodgers. ""We made these rules, they are playing by them. My hope would be that if and when rules change they will play by those new rules as well,"" he said.Britain is due to publish on Wednesday details of plans for a tax to target such multinational companies. The U.S. ambassador reaffirmed American support for Britain's remaining in the European Union, two weeks after British Prime Minister David Cameron gave his strongest indication yet that he may campaign to leave the 28-nation bloc.Cameron has promised to reform Britain's ties with the EU before a referendum on its membership in 2017, if he is re-elected next year.""We really value a strong United Kingdom in a strong EU because we see eye to eye ... on the important issues of the challenges we face,"" he said.""From a selfish point of view it's a really good thing, but it is entirely up to you folks to figure out your relationship with and within Europe.""

499,"   By Alexei Oreskovic | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Facebook Inc (FB.O) has stopped including results from Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) Bing search engine on its social networking site. The move, confirmed by a company spokesperson, comes as Facebook has revamped its own search offerings, introducing a tool on Monday that allows users to quickly find past comments and other information posted by their friends on Facebook.     The decision may reflect the increasing importance that Facebook sees in Web search technology, a market dominated by rival Google Inc (GOOGL.O). Searches on Facebook have long been geared toward helping users connect with friends and to find other information that exists within the walls of the 1.35 billion-user social networking service.

505,"   By Alexei Oreskovic | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Facebook Inc (FB.O) acquired a company that makes voice recognition technology for wearable devices and Internet- connected appliances, the latest sign of its ambition to extend its reach beyond computers and smartphones. Facebook said it acquired wit.ai on Monday, without providing a price for the deal. The 18-month old company, based in Palo Alto, California, makes software that can understand spoken words as well as written text phrased in ""natural language.""A Facebook representative declined to provide details on how Facebook planned to use the technology or with which group within Facebook the wit.ai team would work.  The deal comes as technology companies are racing to bring Internet connectivity to a new crop of devices, from watches to washing machines. Voice recognition, the technology that helps power services such as Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) Siri, is considered a key building block for the new devices to earn mainstream consumer appeal.  Facebook, the world's largest Internet social network, with 1.3 billion users, is increasingly looking beyond the PCs, tablets and smartphones currently used to access its service. In March, it acquired virtual reality headset maker Oculus VR for $2 billion. The deal for wit.ai is likely to have been significantly smaller. Wit.ai announced in October that it had raised $3 million in a funding round led by venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz.

506,"   By Deepa Seetharaman | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Jan 6 Crowdsourced fundraising site Kickstarter has dropped Amazon.com Inc as its global payments processor in favor of  Stripe, the fast-growing startup used by Twitter Inc, Facebook Inc and Apple Inc.The switch comes as the Internet retailer begins to move clients from its customizable checkout service to an Amazon-branded one. In a blog post on Tuesday, Kickstarter said it made the switch after Amazon decided to drop its Flexible Payments Service, which allows a company to develop its own checkout process. The new Amazon-branded Login and Pay service does not offer as much flexibility. Amazon's payments division has processed more than $1 billion in Kickstarter pledges and had worked with the site even before its launch in 2009. An Amazon spokesman declined to comment. Some analysts have said Amazon has been held back in payments because merchants are wary of handing over customer data to the company, which is rapidly expanding into new areas and competing with sellers.In early December, Stripe raised $70 million from Sequoia Capital and other investors that valued the startup at $3.5 billion, double from a year earlier.

510,"   By Denny Thomas and Gerry Shih | HONG KONG/BEIJING  HONG KONG/BEIJING Mark Zuckerberg and Xiaomi Inc CEO Lei Jun discussed a potential investment by Facebook in China's top smartphone maker ahead of its $1.1 billion fundraising last month, but a deal never materialized, several people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.The discussions, at a private dinner when Zuckerberg visited Beijing in October, were never formalized, three of those people said, as the two CEOs weighed the political and commercial implications of Facebook - which has been banned in China since 2009 - buying into the Chinese tech star now valued at $45 billion.One individual with direct knowledge of Xiaomi's fundraising said the mooted Facebook investment was ""not huge,"" but the talks underscore how ties between U.S. and Chinese companies have deepened as China's tech industry matures.A Facebook investment in Xiaomi would have raised the international profile of the popular handset maker dubbed ""China's Apple"" by its fans and linked it to a U.S. social networking phenomenon with more than 1.3 billion users. Facebook, for its part, has long harbored ambitions to expand into the world's most populous country, potentially with partners. One of the individuals said Facebook and Xiaomi began discussing a possible investment in mid-2014.Xiaomi's Lei was partly put off by the potential for political fallout at home of selling a stake to Facebook while the U.S. social network is still banned in China, two of the people said, adding Xiaomi also feared a tie-up with Facebook could threaten its relationship with Google Inc, a crucial business partner. Xiaomi's phones are built on Google's Android operating system.Xiaomi ultimately announced last month it raised $1.1 billion from investors including Hong Kong-based tech fund All Stars Investment; DST Global, a private equity firm that has invested in Facebook and Alibaba Group; Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC; Chinese fund Hopu Management; and Alibaba founder Jack Ma's Yunfeng Capital.The fundraising valued Beijing-based Xiaomi at $45 billion just three years after it sold its first smartphone. The company had revenue of close to $12 billion in 2014. Zuckerberg has eyed China as a critical piece of his vision to connect the global population. But, like Google and Twitter, the social networking giant has been blocked by China's internet censors, who cite national security concerns.""Facebook wants to get into China, and Xiaomi is keen to expand outside, so they both recognize the importance of working together,"" said one of the knowledgeable individuals, none of whom wanted to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter.Xiaomi and Facebook declined to comment for this article.The two CEOs knew each other previously and deepened their relationship last year. In October, Zuckerberg was invited for dinner at Lei's Beijing home along with Facebook business development chief John Lagerling and China head Vaughan Smith.The next day, Zuckerberg, whose wife is Chinese-American, addressed the prestigious Tsinghua University and won plaudits for speaking in Mandarin during a 30-minute Q&A session. As Xiaomi sought financing last year, ICONIQ Capital, a San Francisco-based fund that manages several individuals' personal wealth, including Zuckerberg's, also considered buying shares, but ultimately did not, several people with knowledge of the matter said. Talks about ICONIQ taking part in Xiaomi's financing were not led by Zuckerberg himself.ICONIQ declined to comment.CALLED OFF  Xiaomi is China's biggest smartphone maker, according to some industry analysts, and trails only Samsung Electronics and Apple in global market share.A strategic partnership with Xiaomi would give Facebookanother avenue to distribute its apps and potentially provide a powerful ally in its bid to overturn its China ban.For Xiaomi, access to Facebook's vast banks of user data would be valuable as it seeks to grow into a global internet company providing comprehensive online services.But Lei thought it would be ""too sensitive"" to sell an equity stake to Facebook given its uncertain political status in China, said one of the people with knowledge of the matter.China's top internet censor, Lu Wei, has warned that social media, particularly foreign services, could be a destabilizing force for Chinese society. Lu, however, visited Facebook's U.S. headquarters last month, prompting speculation that relations between Facebook and China's government were warming.

Access to the application's services is free, but links that lead to information on other websites will require users to pay data charges. The service may even aid the country, which has 21 million Facebook users, as it seeks an end to 50 years of war with Marxist rebels, Zuckerberg said.""Just giving people the tools of connectivity is important by itself in creating communication and a tighter social fabric in creating peace,"" the 30-year-old CEO said. The service, first launched in Zambia back in July, will eventually be available via other mobile providers. Facebook has partnered with more than 150 wireless providers over the past four years to offer free or discounted access to its social network, but the new app is the first time the company has added services beyond its own website.""Our obsession is how we can use technology to reach our big goals, first peace, which will allow us more equality and better education,"" Santos said.

""Just giving people the tools of connectivity is important by itself in creating communication and a tighter social fabric in creating peace,"" the 30-year-old CEO said.The service, first launched in Zambia back in July, will eventually be available via other mobile providers.Facebook has partnered with more than 150 wireless providers over the past four years to offer free or discounted access to its social network, but the new app is the first time the company has added services beyond its own website. ""Our obsession is how we can use technology to reach our big goals, first peace, which will allow us more equality and better education,"" Santos said.While 85 percent of the global population lives in areas with mobile phone coverage, only 30 percent have access to the Internet, according to Tigo. Around 3 billion people will have online access by the end of 2014, the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) has said.Facebook hopes the Internet.org project will help more than 4 billion Internet-less people worldwide, many of whom live in Africa and India.The initiative has the potential to boost the size of Facebook's audience, which totals 1.32 billion monthly users.

515,"   By Helen Murphy and Luis Jaime Acosta | BOGOTA  BOGOTA Facebook Inc Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg launched a free Internet application in Colombia on Wednesday as part of a drive to bring developing markets online, but remained mute on when and if the company would look to move into China.Colombia is the first nation in Latin America and the fourth in the world to receive the new Internet.org service, in partnership with local mobile phone provider Tigo, but the aim is to push the app globally, Zuckerberg told Reuters.The mobile app, aimed at low income and rural users, offers more than a dozen tools via the Android operating system - like encyclopedia Wikipedia, weather websites, job listings and health information, as well as Facebook's own social network and messaging service - without the user incurring any data charges. It has already been launched in three countries in Africa, including Zambia.During his first trip to Bogota, the billionaire founder of Facebook said the app would spread very quickly as phone operators reap the benefits of increased revenue from new customers using the services.""Our goal is to make the Internet.org program available across the world and to help everyone get connected to the Internet,"" the 30-year old Zuckerberg said.""We're going to look back a year from now and there will hopefully be a lot more countries that have programs like this.""Although he declined to say where the program would be launched next, he is betting the application will soon be the ""default"" among mobile operators worldwide to expand Internet access. Those not offering the service will be ""lagging"" behind.It ""will stop being that only the most visionary and forward-leaning operators want to start doing it and it'll start being the case that it's more the default, right, where it's almost like you're not doing it if you're lagging,"" said Zuckerberg, dressed in his trademark jeans and gray T-shirt. Asked when he would look to move into China, Zuckerberg said: ""Who knows ... that's very different.""Zuckerberg and Xiaomi Inc CEO Lei Jun discussed a potential investment by Facebook in China's top smartphone maker ahead of its $1.1 billion fundraising last month, but a deal never materialized, several people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters. The company has declined comment.He would not be drawn either on whether recent time spent in Mexico City with telecoms billionaire Carlos Slim would result in a similar Internet.org project, or some another venture.""I'm not going to say anything specific about any partnership that's not final, but, I mean, we're going to want to work with folks across the world on a number of things."" He said the next launch of Internet.org could be as soon as six months.The 30-year-old Harvard drop-out met President Juan Manuel Santos earlier on Wednesday and the two officially launched the Internet.org application at the presidential palace.The tools offered by the service provide a foundation Colombians can use to ""build their own prosperity"", Zuckerberg said.""By giving people these basic tools for free, you're creating an equal playing field,"" he said, referring to entrepreneurs who could use the free Internet to start or grow a business.

516,"   By Alexei Oreskovic and Bill Rigby | SAN FRANCISCO/SEATTLE  SAN FRANCISCO/SEATTLE Virtual reality goggles, drones and data centers are all driving a hiring spree at Facebook Inc (FB.O) that is set to swell its ranks as much as 14 percent in the near term, according to a review of job listings on the company's website. The Internet social networking company aims to add nearly 1,200 new employees, the outgrowth of aggressive investments that executives have said will define the coming year.  Oculus Rift, the maker of virtual reality headsets that Facebook acquired in a $2 billion deal last year, is among the key areas slated for growth, with 54 jobs listed on its website, according to a review by Reuters of listings.Among the roles that Facebook needs to fill for the Oculus business are managers to oversee logistics, procurement and global supply chain planning - a sign, some analysts say, that the product is nearing its commercial release. The market for virtual reality headsets is still nascent. But if virtual reality takes off for entertainment, gaming, communications or computing, Facebook could be at the center of the new platform with Oculus. Facebook’s ambitious effort to build its own satellites and drones capable of delivering Internet service to remote regions of the world is another important area for hiring: the program has Facebook searching for specialists in areas such as avionics, radio frequency communications and thermal engineering.“We are an ambitious company run by an ambitious CEO,” Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg told Reuters in an interview. “Our users are growing and our business is growing and we want to support that,” she said, noting that Facebook’s business is much more expansive today than a few years ago, with offices throughout the world.The jobs run a gamut from sales people to software engineers for Facebook's 1.35-billion-member social network. Facebook's growth spurt comes as the company expands into new markets and faces stiffening competition from Web rivals Google Inc (GOOGL.O), Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N) and well-capitalized start-ups such as Snapchat.“There’s a fairly direct correlation between their investment in people and servers and infrastructure, and their ability to remain competitive,” said Robert Baird & Co analyst Colin Sebastian. Facebook had 8,348 full-time employees at the end of September, far fewer than Google’s roughly 55,000 employees or Microsoft Corp’s (MSFT.O) roughly 127,000 (Microsoft announced in the summer that it plans to cut 18,000 jobs). At the same time, Facebook gets more out of each employee, according to calculations using company revenue figures.  Facebook’s revenue works out to roughly $384,000 per employee in the third quarter of 2014, versus $300,000 for Google and $183,000 for Microsoft. That efficiency has helped Facebook enjoy rich profit margins. And the company's relatively small headcount provides an important talking point in the battle to attract the most talented computer programmers. Facebook has long touted to potential recruits their ability to work directly on products used by hundreds of millions of people, a marked contrast to some larger tech companies. ""We're growing as fast as we can, where the 'can' part is really a factor of how many people we can absorb while maintaining a strong culture,"" Paul Carduner, an engineering manager who runs Facebook's Seattle office, told Reuters at one of the company's famed 'Hackathon' events last week.The hackathons feature Facebook programmers hunched over their computers and working through the night on personal projects that could eventually become Facebook products.  Facebook is growing exponentially in Seattle, a tech hub with a rich, and relatively cheap, talent pool created by local tech companies Microsoft and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O). Facebook currently has more than 400 employees in Seattle, and is looking for a larger site close to the center of the city that could hold as many as 2,000 people, according to a person familiar with the matter. At Facebook’s Menlo Park, California, headquarters, construction is expected to be completed this year on a new, roughly 500,000 square foot building designed by architect Frank Gehry that can accommodate 3,000 employees.Atlas, the online advertising technology that Facebook acquired in 2013, is another big area of hiring, with more than 20 open positions listed. The many opportunities Facebook is chasing could lift the company’s annual revenue to $30 billion within a few years, estimates Arvind Bhatia, an analyst with Sterne, Agee & Leach.“To get to that level, they’re going to have to get people now,” Bhatia said.

517,"   By Julia Fioretti | BRUSSELS  BRUSSELS European Union member states are unlikely to support an EU-wide ban on telecoms companies offering online services such as Facebook and Spotify for free, according to a proposal by EU presidency Latvia. EU member states are discussing net neutrality - the principle that all traffic should be treated equally - as part of efforts to agree on reform of the European telecoms sector.So-called ""zero-rating"", where operators offer unlimited access to certain online services - typically Facebook, music streaming or online television - is seen as good for  competition and innovation as well as more choice for consumers.But some consumer groups, internet activists and member states consider this to be in breach of net neutrality since it makes some services more attractive than others and operators can choose to make their own services zero-rated, thereby distorting competition. A proposal on net neutrality by Latvia, seen by Reuters, says that an explicit ban on positive price discrimination - such as zero-rating - was unlikely to gain the support of all members.""The issue of positive price discrimination could be left outside the scope of this instrument...this would allow each member state to decide whether to ban price discrimination at national level, or leave the assessment of such practices to general competition law,"" the document says. Supporters of zero-rating argue it is a way of giving low-income customers greater access to the Internet. For example, Wikipedia is offered for free as part of the ""Wikipedia Zero"" campaign in 48 countries worldwide by carriers such as Orange and Telenor.Countries such as the Netherlands and Norway already have bans on price discrimination - meaning operators cannot offer some services outside of a customer's data allowance - but an EU-wide ban would extend that to all 28 member states. Leaving the choice to individual governments runs the risk of a patchwork of approaches across the EU, however, contrary to its aim to develop a single market in the telecoms sector.Member state representatives will discuss the Latvian proposal next Tuesday, where they are expected to decide whether to include a ban or not, diplomats said.

519,"   By Piya Sinha-Roy | PARK CITY, Utah  PARK CITY, Utah Facebook Inc's Oculus VR is getting into movies with an in-house studio dedicated to making virtual-reality films and will show its first short movie at the Sundance Film Festival on Monday, the company said.Tapping talent from both Pixar, the animation studio behind computer graphics imagery (CGI) films including ""Toy Story"" and ""Monsters Inc,"" and the video gaming world, Oculus' Story Studio will develop film content for virtual reality and advise other filmmakers seeking to try the technology.Facebook bought Oculus last year for $2 billion. So far the business has largely focused on video games for its pioneering wrap-around Rift headset. But virtual reality has recently been enticing Hollywood's filmmakers to expand into the 360-degree panoramic view offered by headsets.At the annual Sundance Festival in Park City, Utah, part of the event has been dedicated to virtual-reality short movies by filmmakers including Chris Milk and Felix & Paul, to draw the independent film community. ""I think the (film) community has done a really good job about getting excited about VR and starting to work on things in  VR,"" said Oculus Chief Executive Officer Brendan Iribe.Oculus also hopes to explore VR film experiences in real time, which would allow viewers to interact inside the headset with objects and characters, he said.  ""This is really tuning in to what a lot of people who are extending 360-degree film into VR cannot do yet. It's getting into the heart and soul and magic of VR.""    Oculus will debut the short film ""Lost"" at Sundance, which the in-house studio developed over the past six months. ""Lost"" is designed to be interactive and is between 4 and 10 minutes long, depending on the viewer's interactive choices. But virtual-reality films are still a long way from becoming mainstream as the headsets to display them have yet to reach the mass market. While Samsung Electronics Co Ltd offers its Galaxy Gear VR headset with its Galaxy Note 4 smartphone and Google Inc has its Cardboard VR device to use with smartphones, the consumer version of Oculus' Rift headset is still in development. There are also technological and creative constraints to developing film in virtual reality, said Saschka Unseld, a Pixar veteran who is now creative director of Oculus' Story Studio. Challenges include computers running too slowly to handle the intensive rendering of graphics in real time, as well as how to find a format for storytelling in a 360-degree environment where the viewer can look anywhere.""Film has very linear storytelling, it's one-dimensional,"" Unseld said. ""In VR, you need to find a three-dimensional way of telling the story where the space around you matters.""

521,"  (Adds comment from source familiar with case)ANKARA Jan 26 A Turkish court has ordered Facebook to block a number of pages deemed insulting to the Prophet Mohammad, threatening to stop access to the whole social networking site if it does not comply, state broadcaster TRT reported. The order, made by the court on Sunday, followed a request by a prosecutor, TRT said. A source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Monday that Facebook had blocked one page in response to a valid legal request from Turkish authorities. The court order is the latest move to crack down on material seen as offending religious sensibilities in the largely Muslim nation, where the government of President Tayyip Erdogan is widely seen as pursuing an Islamist-leaning agenda. Earlier this month, prosecutors launched an inquiry into a newspaper that reprinted parts of the French satirical weekly Charlie Hebdo in the wake of an attack by Islamic militants on its offices in Paris.

After 24 hours the stories disappear, in keeping with Snapchat's trademark feature of private messages that disappear a few seconds after they are viewed by users of the service. The addition of news and entertainment content represents the latest expansion for Los Angeles-based Snapchat, which has become a popular communications tool for teenagers. In November, Snapchat partnered with online payments company Square to offer a service that lets users send money to each other.The new Snapchat features reflect the growing competition among mobile messaging apps and social networks to entice users to spend more time on their free, advertising-supported services. Snapchat did not disclose financial terms of the media partnerships for its Discover service, but a person familiar with the matter told Reuters that it involved revenue-share arrangements. Full-screen video ads will be interspersed throughout some of the stories.Snapchat, which previously turned down a $3 billion offer to be acquired by Facebook according to another person with knowledge of the matter, has been valued at $10 billion in its most recent fundraising effort, according to media reports.

523,"   By Eric Auchard | FRANKFURT  FRANKFURT Access to Facebook (FB.O), the world's largest social network, and its Instagram photo-sharing site, were blocked around the world for up to an hour on Tuesday, which the company said later was due to an internal fault and not an outside attack.The outage at Facebook, which started around 0600 GMT, appeared to spill over and temporarily slow or block traffic to other major Internet sites, according to web and mobile user reports from around the globe.U.S.-based online match-making site Tinder, a unit of IAC/InterActive Corp (IACI.O), and Hipchat, the workplace instant- messaging service of Australian enterprise software company Atlassian, were also down around the same period, but recovered.A hacker group associated with other recent high-profile attacks on other online services sought to claim responsibility for the outages, but Facebook said the fault was its own.“This was not the result of a third-party attack but instead occurred after we introduced a change that affected our configuration systems,"" Facebook said. ""Both services are back to 100 percent for everyone.”Users in the United States and many countries in Asia and Europe reported that they were unable to log on to the websites of Facebook, Instagram and corresponding mobile apps including Facebook and Facebook Messenger. During the outages, Facebook users were greeted with the message: ""Sorry, something went wrong. We're working on it and we'll get it fixed as soon as we can.""""If you run a service with the capacity (and complexity) to deliver media for hundreds of millions of users, it's inevitable that things don't always go according to plan,"" said Steve Santorelli, a former London police detective and now a researcher at U.S. threat intelligence firm Team Cymru.Facebook counted more than 1.35 billion web and 1.12 mobile phone users on a monthly basis in September, the latest date for which official figures are available. Earlier on Tuesday a Twitter account that purports to speak for hacker group ""Lizard Squad"" posted messages suggesting that it was behind an attack that temporarily blocked several major web sites, including Facebook and Instagram. The Lizard Squad is a group of unknown hackers that has taken credit for several high-profile outages, including the attacks that took down the Sony (6758.T)  PlayStation Network and Microsoft's (MSFT.O) Xbox Live network last month.Santorelli said that attacking Internet sites which operate at the size and scale of Facebook via a classic distributed denial of service attack would be a huge undertaking, which, while not entirely impossible, would be ""monumentally hard."" Denial of service attacks direct thousands of infected computers under an attacker's control to ping a site or sites, thereby slowing or blocking access for regular users. Such attacks can create congestion on branches of the Internet where the site is located, slowing Web traffic and affecting access to unrelated services. As a precaution, Facebook users are advised to change their passwords and review their privacy settings, Santorelli said.

The Internet social networking company, which has dazzled with two years of breakneck revenue growth, is struggling to win support for plans to pump billions of dollars into infrastructure and businesses ranging from virtual reality headsets to satellites.Facebook shares fell about 2 percent in after-hours trading on Wednesday, after the company beat Wall Street's fourth-quarter revenue target and discussed aggressive 2015 spending plans. The stock has fallen 7.6 percent since late October, when it first outlined these plans.""Expectations for Facebook are already very high and perhaps some commentary around aggressive investments can spook investors a bit,"" said Colin Sebastian, a Robert W. Baird & Co analyst.Facebook said on Wednesday that 2015 capital expenditures will range from $2.7 billion to $3.2 billion, a sharp increase from $1.83 billion in 2014.  While Facebook slightly narrowed the range of its expected  increase in 2015 operating expenses, the projected level remains well above previous levels. Facebook's staff grew 45 percent to 9,200 employees in 2014 through hiring and buying a string of companies. The hiring shows no signs of slowing down, with listings for more than 1,200 positions posted on Facebook's website earlier this month.

The company's stock is up more than 16 percent year to date and reached an intraday record high of $129.45 per share.

Last week, its stock market value ballooned above $700 billion, bigger than Switzerland's gross domestic product.Although Apple is the biggest position in Coatue Management's portfolio, the firm sold 1.7 million shares at the end of the quarter, or 15 percent of its stake in the company, leaving it with 8.9 million shares, according to a regulatory filing on Tuesday.In a filing on Friday, Greenlight cut Apple holdings by 6.2 percent to 8.6 million shares during the quarter.Eric Mandelblatt's Soroban Capital Partners sold 4.3 million Apple call options, liquidating the fund's position. And David Tepper's Appaloosa Management hedge fund revealed that it had dissolved its stake in Apple.Last week, billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn said the technology company's shares should be trading at $216 apiece, equivalent to a market capitalization of about $1.26 trillion.The moves by Greenlight and Coatue were revealed in quarterly disclosures of manager stock holdings, known as 13F filings, with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. They are of great interest to investors trying to divine a pattern in what savvy traders are selling and buying.But relying on the filings to develop an investment strategy comes with some peril because the disclosures are backward-looking and come out 45 days after the end of each quarter.Still, the filings offer a glimpse into what hedge fund managers saw as opportunities to make money on the long side.The filings do not disclose short positions, or bets that a stock will fall in price. As a result, the public filings do not always present a complete picture of a management firm's stock holdings.The following are some of the hot stocks and sectors in which hedge fund managers either took new positions or exited existing positions in the fourth quarter.ACTAVIS Coatue Management opened a new position, buying 964,155 shares, as the pharmaceutical company Actavis Plc won the high-stakes battle to buy Botox maker Allergan Inc.Daniel Loeb's Third Point upped its stake by 20 percent to 3.5 million shares. But Neil Chriss' Hutchin Hill cut its position by 13 percent, selling 17,201 shares to own 28.3 million at the end of the quarter.AGRIUM INC Activist investor ValueAct bought 2.9 million shares to own 8.2 million at the end of the quarter. AMGEN INC The biotechnology company is being pressured by hedge fund investor Daniel Loeb to break itself apart and has seen its share price rise in the last quarter.Alex Denner, who now runs Sarissa Capital after working for Carl Icahn, upped his stake by 165 percent to 50.6 million shares.BAKER HUGHES INC Farallon Capital Management put on a new position in the oilfield services company, which will be bought by rival Halliburton Co, buying 3.5 million shares.Activist fund ValueAct Capital, which like Farallon is located in San Francisco, took an even bigger new position, buying up 14.9 million shares. ValueAct also took a 20.9 million-share stake in Halliburton.BANK OF AMERICA John Burbank's Passport Capital, which made money early this year by betting against energy exchange-traded funds, added a position in Bank of America Corp, buying 2.8 million shares. EBAY Jon Jacobson's Highfields Capital upped its stake in eBay Inc by 39 percent when it added 1.8 million shares to own 6.5 million at the quarter's end. Third Point bought 5.5 million shares to own 10 million shares.FACEBOOK INC Tiger Consumer cut its holdings by 28 percent to 854,980 shares. Aaron Cowen's Suvretta Capital bought 629,600 shares, putting on a new position.GENERAL MOTORS CO Caxton Associates made a new bet, buying 1.2 million shares in the automaker. LIBERTY GLOBAL PLC Coatue raised its stake in the European cable operator by 34 percent and bought 1.4 million shares to own 5.6 million shares. Tiger Consumer sold 527,956 shares, leaving it with 1.5 million shares.NETFLIX INC Coatue cut its position by 13 percent, selling 287,415 shares to own 1.8 million shares. Tiger Consumer, however, opened a new position, buying 182,098 shares.TESLA MOTORS INC Highfields Capital put on a new position in the high-end electric car maker, buying 91,296 shares. Tesla shares fell late last year but climbed anew in early 2015.SUNEDISON INC Third Point nearly doubled its stake by buying 5 million shares to own 11.2 million.The solar energy company saw its shares drop late last year but recover in the last months.YAHOO INC Passport Capital slashed its position by 81 percent, selling 6 million shares to own 1.4 million at the end of the quarter.ZOETIS INC The animal health company, which made headlines when activist investors William Ackman and Scott Ferguson bought big stakes, also saw new interest from other hedge funds. Highfields Capital bought 252,000 shares.

541,"   By Jennifer Saba  Facebook Inc said on Tuesday that its active advertisers rose to 2 million, a 33 percent increase from the 1.5 million it had in July 2014.The vast majority of the advertisers, defined as those that have placed an ad on the social media platform in the last 30 days, represent small- and medium-sized business owners.""Small business owners are really hard to reach and they are not tech savvy usually,"" Facebook's chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, said in an interview. She added that 30 million small business owners have Facebook pages.Facebook also launched a mobile app for advertisers to use to manage their campaigns. Of Facebook's newly acquired advertisers in the 2014 fourth quarter, 80 percent started by paying for a promoted post. Facebook does not break out the actual number of small business advertisers versus big brands, but they tend to spend on average $5 to $50 a day. That compares to the millions spent annually by big companies.  Sandberg said that the fastest areas of growth of small business advertising are in regions of Europe-Middle East-Africa and Asia Pacific.Getting more advertisers onto its platform is critical for Facebook as it tries to increase global share. Facebook's fourth-quarter revenue grew 49 percent to $3.85 billion from the same period a year ago, with mobile accounting for 69 percent of advertising revenue. Google is the worldwide leader in digital advertising market share, at 31.1 percent, according to estimates from research firm eMarketer. But Google's slice has shrunk slightly, down from 33.6 percent in 2013. Facebook, on the other hand, increased its share to 7.8 percent in 2014 from 5.8 percent in 2013, according to eMarketer.It is unknown how many advertisers Google currently has. In 2007, it said it was used by 1 million advertisers. Padraig Bracken, marketing manager at Y-Volution, a Dublin-based toy company that makes scooters for kids, said he plans to spend 60 percent of his digital marketing budget with Facebook this year. ""Facebook is pushing a lot harder than Google,"" he said. ""Google search is the king but it's getting more expensive.""Kay Martinovic, who owns Kay's Designer Consignment in Ormond Beach, Florida, said that it is so easy to target potential customers that she trimmed her spend with the platform to $4,200 in 2014 from $9,000 in 2013.

543,"   By Jonathan Stempel  Bill Gates stands atop Forbes magazine's annual list of the world's richest people, as Facebook Inc's Mark Zuckerberg joined the top 20 and basketball star Michael Jordan plowed new air by making the list for the first time.Gates' net worth rose to $79.2 billion from $76 billion a year earlier, putting the Microsoft Corp co-founder at the top for the 16th year in the last 21, Forbes said on Monday.Mexico telecommunications mogul Carlos Slim Helu ranked second, worth $77.1 billion, while Berkshire Hathaway Inc chief Warren Buffett was third, at $72.7 billion.Amancio Ortega, the Spanish founder of Inditex SA, which includes clothing retailer Zara, was fourth at $64.5 billion, while Oracle Corp Chairman Larry Ellison was fifth at $54.3 billion.Buffett's fortune grew $14.5 billion from a year earlier, more than anyone's else, despite his having donated $2.8 billion to several charities last July.Aliko Dangote, a Nigerian who became Africa's richest man through cement manufacturing and commodities such as flour and sugar, was the biggest loser, falling $10.3 billion to $14.7 billion. Forbes identified a record 1,826 billionaires, up from 1,645 last year, worth a combined $7.05 trillion.Of the record 197 women, the highest-ranked was Wal-Mart Stores Inc heiress Christy Walton, who was eighth at $41.7 billion.France's Liliane Bettencourt, who got much of her wealth from cosmetics company L'Oreal SA, was 10th at $40.1 billion. Zuckerberg, 30, rose to 16th place from 21st last year, as his net worth grew to $33.4 billion.The youngest billionaires were Evan Spiegel, 24, and Bobby Murphy, 25, who co-founded mobile messaging app Snapchat, and are each worth $1.5 billion.Meanwhile, Jordan ranked 1,741st with a $1 billion net worth. The 52-year-old is majority owner of the Charlotte Hornets basketball team, but is better known for his Hall of Fame playing days with the Chicago Bulls and endorsement contract with Nike Inc, which makes Air Jordan shoes. Jordan's business manager did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The United States had the most billionaires, with 536, followed by China at 213, Germany at 103 and India at 90.Russia, which has struggled with currency and oil market turmoil, saw its collection of billionaires fall to 88 from 111, Forbes said.(This version of the story filed to correct Mark Zuckerberg's net worth in paragraph 10 to $33.4 billion from $34.8 billion, which Forbes reported as his net worth in real time as of Monday.

544,"   By Eric Auchard | BARCELONA  BARCELONA Telecom equipment maker Ericsson and chipmaker Intel have agreed a partnership deal to help network operator customers build datacenters, putting them on a more competitive footing against big, cloud-based Internet firms such as Google, Facebook and Amazon.""We will build datacenter equipment which will actually have the same performance as many of the big cloud providers are doing for themselves,"" Ericsson's chief executive, Hans Vestberg, told a news conference at the Mobile World Congress telecoms trade show in Barcelona on Monday.Ericsson, the world's leading maker of mobile network equipment, said it will help its global base of major telecoms companies to shift to cloud computing using Intel datacenter designs to compete more actively with Web rivals.No financial terms of the partnership were disclosed. Over the past decade Web-based services like Google, Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft have stopped buying finished computers, storage devices and network components and instead developed their own systems in-house to create massive, low-cost datacenters in the cloud to serve billions of users.Ericsson's partnership with Intel, the world's largest chipmaker, puts it in a crowded market for providing bespoke datacenters, where it will also be competing with a range of technology suppliers including Cisco and IBM.  The Swedish company's plan is to focus initially on equipping big telecom operators rather than competing for new corporate customers in other industries, its CEO said.Telecom operators are rushing to build datacenters in the cloud to slash the cost of hardware spending within their networks, improve the range of services they offer subscribers and to obtain the Web-wide reach of the big Internet companies. ""The difference is that we are going to provide it to the market,"" Vestberg said.

560,"   By Alexei Oreskovic  Facebook Inc clarified its rules banning certain content from its social network, as the Internet company strives to curb controversial posts such as support for violent militant groups and nudity without damaging its status as a global hub for users to share information.The 1.39 billion-member social network updated its “community standards” late Sunday, providing specific examples of content prohibited under its general rules against direct threats, hate speech and criminal activity. While Facebook has long forbidden groups it deems to be terrorist organizations from posting content on its service, the company specified that it will remove content that expresses support for such groups or praises their leaders. Facebook also made clear that images “shared in revenge or without permission,” often referred to as “revenge porn,” are forbidden. But photos of women breastfeeding, post-mastectomy scarring and images of paintings and sculptures with nude figures are permissible. The clarification comes as social media companies such as Facebook and Twitter Inc grapple with self-regulating technology that is as easily used for harassment and online bullying as it is for sharing sports videos and news articles.  “Having a voice is not some absolute state. It’s not the case that you either have a voice or you don’t,” Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said in a post on his Facebook page on Sunday. Zuckerberg said Facebook was not actually changing any of its policies or standards, but merely providing more guidance.“People rightfully want to know what content we will take down, what controversial content we'll leave up, and why,” Zuckerberg wrote.  Images of graphic violence and nudity have long been problematic for Facebook. In 2013, Facebook said it would use a broader set of criteria to determine when gory videos are permitted on the site after a video of a masked man beheading a woman in Mexico prompted an outcry. The company has also been criticized for allowing pages that glorify violence against women. Militant groups such as Islamic State have increasingly used social media to spread their message. Facebook also said on Sunday that it recorded a slight increase in government requests for account data in the second half of 2014. Requests for account data increased to 35,051 in the second half of 2014 from 34,946 in the first half, with requests from countries such as India rising and those from others, including the United States and Germany, falling.

562,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Boeing Co (BA.N) on Monday said it could clinch a deal this year to build a high-throughput communications satellite for top technology companies such as Google Inc (GOOGL.O), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Facebook Inc (FB.O) or Apple Inc (AAPL.O).Jim Simpson, vice president of business development and chief strategist for Boeing Network and Space Systems, told Reuters the big technology firms were keen to expand Internet access around the world to help them grow. ""The real key to being able to do these type of things is ultra high-throughput capabilities, where we’re looking at providing gigabytes, terrabytes, petabytes of capability,"" Simpson told Reuters after a panel at the Satellite 2015 conference.Simpson declined to give specific details about discussions with the tech companies. He said the challenge was to drive down the cost of satellite communications to be more in line with terrestrial costs, which would help the tech firms justify the expense of building a larger communications satellite. But if sufficient demand failed to materialize, the tech companies would be left with the cost of ""a really high performance satellite,"" he said.Boeing and other satellite makers have been eying a new source of demand from technology firms such as Google and Amazon.com, given their interest in reaching the estimated 70 percent of the globe that still lacks access to the Internet. Privately held Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX, has said it plans to build a system of 4,000 satellites in low Earth orbit (LEO) for global Internet connectivity. In January, it received $1 billion in investments from Google and mutual-fund giant Fidelity Investments.Simpson noted that the Google investment was an equity stake in the company, not in the satellite project, but declined to say whether that meant Google could still be a possible customer for a higher-end Boeing system in geosynchronous Earth orbit (GEO).Mark Spiwak, president of Boeing Satellite Systems International, said he expected demand for GEO satellites to remain steady at about two dozen a year, but he said those satellites would clearly need to have greater processing power and larger bandwidth, given rising demand for global connectivity. He said GEO satellites were larger and more expensive, but they would save the cost of more frequent maintenance and launch costs for a large network of low-earth orbit satellites. At the same time, he said Boeing was also prepared to build LEO satellites, depending on customer preference.(Story refiles to correct typo in ""petabytes"" in 3rd paragraph) (Reporting by Andrea Shalal; Editing by Ken Wills)",2015-03-17,FB,"Tue Mar 17, 2015 | 9:18am EDT",Boeing eyes satellite deal with tech giant this year,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-boeing-satellites-idUSKBN0MD00T20150317?type=companyNews

Tencent has long depended on online gaming to generate revenue, but the company which competes on several fronts with Alibaba Group Holding Ltd and Baidu Inc, also wants to emulate Facebook's success in making money from mobile advertising, as well as its online video platform.At the same time, Tencent said it would continue to look at investments in Chinese and in foreign companies, particularly entertainment content providers.The Shenzhen-based company plans to increase spending on video content in 2015, executives told a conference call, after fourth-quarter earnings showed net income had missed forecasts while sharing and content costs ate into sales. Tencent, which rules the roost for Chinese social networks with its ubiquitous WeChat and QQ messaging services, wants to expand social advertising in China, gunning for the same kind of domination enjoyed by Facebook in the United States, said Martin Lau, Tencent's president.""Given what Facebook has achieved in the U.S., we see promising long-term potential,"" Lau said on a conference call. Tencent also flagged its 2014 shopping spree should continue in 2015. The company shelled out more than $2 billion on acquisitions last year, a splurge unlikely to end as it grapples with rival internet firms Alibaba and Baidu to gain the upper hand on mobile devices in China, the world's largest smartphone market.That excludes doling out large sums for video content, the extent of which Tencent declines to disclose. But it saw a ramp-up this year. It has recently inked licensing deals for television, film, sport and music, including with U.S. cable broadcaster HBO and the NBA.Tencent's revenue grew 24 percent to 20.98 billion yuan ($3.4 billion) in the three months through December, slightly above forecasts of 20.5 billion, on the back of strong sales from online gaming on PCs and smartphones linked to its social networks.Net income rose 51 percent to 5.95 billion yuan, below estimates of 6.26 billion, according to a Thomson Reuters SmartEstimate poll of 11 analysts.Tencent said in 2015 it would focus on two other areas besides entertainment and advertising: enabling offline business transactions with their mobile internet services; and building up its online payment system.

569,"   By Suchitra Mohanty | NEW DELHI  NEW DELHI India's top court struck down a law on Tuesday that gave authorities powers to jail people for offensive online posts, a verdict hailed as a victory for free speech in the world's largest growth market for the Internet.   Section 66A of the country's Information and Technology (IT) Act was challenged in the Supreme Court by law students, bloggers, writers and rights groups following arrests across the country for statements posted on social media sites.Justices Jasti Chelameshwar and Rohinton F. Nariman in their order said they found ""the law hit at the root of liberty and freedom of expression"".""Our Constitution provides for liberty of thought, expression and belief. In a democracy, these values have to be provided within constitutional scheme. The law (Section 66A) is vague in its entirety,"" they said.The petitioners argued the ""draconian law"" introduced in 2008 by the last government was misused by politicians to hound critics. The government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi said it welcomed the ruling. ""The government absolutely respects the right to freedom of speech and expression on social media and has no intention of curbing it,"" telecom and IT minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said.Facebook (FB.O), Twitter (TWTR.N) and Google (GOOGL.O) did not immediately comment on the ruling but the Internet and Mobile Association of India, a trade body, said the ruling protected consumers and businesses.""This judgment will herald a new phase in the growth and evolution of the Internet in India,"" the group said in a statement that also hailed a separate part of the judgment that makes it harder to force websites to take down content. Both local and foreign Internet companies have in the past faced pressure for hosting content deemed offensive in India, which Google predicts is scheduled to overtake the United States as having the world's largest number of web users by 2018. Last week, police in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh picked up a 16-year-old boy from his school for allegedly posting an insulting remark about a powerful regional politician, the latest victim of a law that was also used to jail a cartoonist in Mumbai. ""It is a big relief. My daughter was accused of posting offensive remarks and was arrested. I don't think expressing one's views is a crime,"" said Farooq Dhada. Shaheen Dhada became a national celebrity after she questioned a labor shutdown after the funeral of a local politician in 2012.Her friend Renu Srinivasan 'liked' the post and both were arrested.

570,"   By Alexei Oreskovic | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Facebook Inc (FB.O) on Wednesday opened up its Messenger service for developers to create apps and for shoppers to communicate directly with retailers, as the Internet company seeks to expand its reach.The new features mark Facebook's latest effort to transform its mobile messaging service into a full-featured platform with the same pull with consumers and businesses as its flagship 1.4-billion user social network.Facebook unveiled the new features at its annual developer conference in San Francisco, for the first time allowing developers to create apps that function inside the Messenger service used by more than 600 million people.Messenger will feature more than 40 different apps in the next few days, allowing users to send each other sports clips, animations and other items, Facebook said. Among the first apps will be those from ESPN and The Weather Channel. ""This is just the first step toward creating better sharing experiences across this whole family of apps,"" Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said on stage at the conference.  Facebook has amassed a collection of mobile apps in recent years, including photo-sharing app Instagram and messaging service WhatsApp, which Facebook acquired for $19 billion in 2014. But the spotlight was on Messenger during the first day of the two-day event.Facebook hopes to turn its messaging service into one that operates independently of the company's social media network as it faces intensifying competition from Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) and Google Inc (GOOGL.O), as well as fast-growing messaging apps such as Snapchat and WeChat.Facebook partnered with online retailers Zulily and Everlane to let consumers contact them directly on Messenger to change online orders, such as the color of a shirt, for example, and be notified when a purchase has shipped. The service will be  available in a few weeks. David Marcus, Facebook's head of messaging products, said in an interview the service was likely to expand to businesses besides retailers.Purchases can be made by sending a message, provided the store has the consumer's payment information, Marcus said. But he declined to say whether Facebook might eventually process such retail purchases directly in Messenger. The new Messenger apps are meant to improve conversations between users, Marcus said. The ESPN app offers short animated sports clips that fans can send to friends.Facebook must pre-approve apps that seek to be integrated into its Messenger service, rather than downloaded separately. But any developer is free to add basic features that will make portions of their apps compatible with Messenger.Marcus said the new features were not offered on its WhatsApp messaging service because that was accessed on a wide variety of mobile phones, including low-end devices which are not well suited for the new functions.

Facebook gained 2 percent in its largest gain in more than three weeks. Corporate earnings season was poised to kick into high gear with a slew of reports this week.Big banks, including JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, are due to report results, providing an expected bright spot in an otherwise gloomy first quarter. Profits of companies on the S&P 500 are projected to have declined 2.9 percent in the first three months from a year ago, according to Thomson Reuters data.The dollar gained 0.3 percent against a basket of major currencies after hitting a peak of 99.99, its highest in four weeks. Market participants have been concerned about the impact of the currency's strength on the profits of multinational companies. ""We had a big move last week and we're heading into earnings season and we've had a few warning signs last week from a couple of companies where the impact of foreign exchange is going to be greater than what was previously thought,"" said Brian Fenske, head of sales trading at ITG in New York.At 11:42 a.m. (1542 GMT) the Dow Jones industrial average  rose 29.42 points, or 0.16 percent, to 18,087.07, the S&P 500 gained 3.08 points, or 0.15 percent, to 2,105.14 and the Nasdaq Composite added 23.89 points, or 0.48 percent, to 5,019.87.Analysts' estimates have dipped on rising oil prices and the stronger dollar but simply beating on earnings is not going to be enough, said Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer at OakBrook Investments in Lisle, Illinois. Investors will be more concerned with revenue, he said. Apple shares rose 0.4 percent to $127.55 as analysts said the company will likely ramp up production of the Apple Watch on strong pre-orders.Netflix shares were up 5.6 percent at $480.10 after the video streaming company said Friday it was seeking to increase its share authorization by nearly 30 times as a possible first step towards a stock split.Qualcomm shares were up 0.3 percent at $69.39 after activist investor Jana Partners asked the chipmaker to consider spinning off its chip unit from its patent-licensing business.Builders FirstSource shares soared 59 percent to $10.96, The supplier of residential building products said it would buy privately-held ProBuild Holdings for $1.63 billion in cash.Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by 1,611 to 1,310, for a 1.23-to-1 ratio; on the Nasdaq, 1,629 issues rose and 960 fell, for a 1.70-to-1 ratio.The S&P 500 was posting 24 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite was recording 85 new highs and 11 new lows.

By contrast, Google's shares in the German market GOOGa.F edged 0.1 percent lower.The European Union will accuse Google Inc on Wednesday of abusing its dominant position in Internet searches, opening the U.S. tech company up to a risk of massive fines and enforced changes in its business model, reported the Financial Times and Wall Street Journal. However, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters that a formal antitrust charge sheet will not be ready for Wednesday and could take several more months to draw up. The EU can impose fines of up to 10 percent of global turnover, or more than $6 billion in penalties in Google's case.

581,"  * Long-term shareholders to get double voting rights in 2016* Rebel resolution to keep simple voting rights falls short* Aims to build European media champion after divestments* Bollore cautions deal-making will take time, prudence   (Adds result of vote, details)By Leila Abboud and Gwénaëlle BarzicPARIS, April 17 Vivendi's chairman and main shareholder Vincent Bollore won double voting rights at the company's annual shareholders' meeting on Friday after opponents failed to get support for their motion to keep a one-share-one-vote structure.Bollore, a billionaire who made his name as a corporate raider, says giving him tighter control of Vivendi will enable him better to create a competitor to powerful, rich rivals like Google and Facebook.But the man who built transport and logistics company Bollore Groupe told shareholders at the meeting that it would take time to build Vivendi into a media powerhouse, warning that attractive deals in the industry were thin on the ground and the risk of overpaying considerable.Vivendi is in transition phase after selling off four of its six businesses and exiting telecoms completely. It has a 15 billion euro ($16.18 billion) war chest that it wants to deploy to become a European champion in media, building on its Universal Music Group and pay-TV business Canal Plus. Only 50.05 percent of shareholders voted in favour of the rebel resolution that would have kept the principle of one vote, one share. Under a law taking effect next year, a two-thirds majority is needed to stop the double voting rights switch.Bollore told the annual general meeting that double voting rights were ""in the interest of all holders"" not just himself, adding: ""Just look at Google or Facebook, where founders have a strong hold on groups and therefore can move very quickly.""Once he has double voting rights, the tycoon will be able to decide almost single-handedly what happens next to Vivendi.Double voting rights already exist at many French companies and are set to become more widespread after France's Socialist government passed a law last year to grant them to shareholders registered for more than two years. The move came about because the state wants to keep its influence at companies like Renault and Orange  while it sells off part of its stake in them to fund a reduction in the national debt. Eleven blue chips are trying to override the double voting rights law, and Vivendi was the only non-state backed one where the management did not propose and support a resolution to override the law.Bollore also told shareholders that Vivendi had to be realistic about its acquisition ambitions since sellers would not let go of media assets at cut-rate prices.""None of the owners of media assets are going to sell us great businesses for less than their market value. So it's up to us to pay the right, fair price, then create value,"" Bollore said.Vivendi has been scouting for media targets in the past year and had pitches from bankers about various options including a mega deal to takeover European pay-TV leader Sky PLC  and smaller moves to expand in radio, magazines and publishing. Earlier this month, Bollore made its first acquisition by buying video-sharing site Dailymotion for 217 million euros from French telecom group Orange, which had been looking for a buyer for years only to see the government scupper its sale to U.S. and Chinese buyers.Dailymotion has struggled to compete with much larger rival YouTube, which is owned by Google, attracting 128 million unique visitors per month versus 1 billion for YouTube. It has less than 100 million euros in sales compared to nearly $4 billion for YouTube.""On acquisitions we will not be satisfied with only Dailymotion this year,"" Bollore told the audience, adding that Vivendi's strategy committee would meet on May 12 to discuss acquisition opportunities.Exane BNP Paribas analysts said Bollore's comments confirmed that ""big deals are unlikely and that value creation will take time"".Bruno Hareng, analyst at Oddo Securities, said the lack of clarity over Vivendi's acquisition plans could weigh on the shares in the coming months.Nevertheless Bollore's track record at creating value at companies from advertising agency Havas to industrial parts maker Vallourec should comfort investors""We think the acquisitions will be modest in size (from 1 to 4 billion euros) and subject to strict financial criteria, just as Bollore has done at Havas,"" Hareng said.Vivendi shares were down 1.3 percent at 12:38 GMT, compared with a 1.5 percent drop for the French blue-chip index.

582,"  * Narrow focus of Google case increases chances EU will succeed* Quick finding Google abused market could lead to further charges* Google biz model not at risk from initial EU objections-analysts* Investors must brace for years of regulatory battlesBy Eric AuchardFRANKFURT, April 17 Start small, win quick, then move on to bigger issues.That appears to be the European Union's strategy to pursue Google in a competition dispute by choosing to push a narrow set of charges around its shopping service, while opening another investigation of Google's Android mobile phone software.Whether or not the EU succeeds in branding Google a market-abusing monopolist in web search - a big if, given that the competition authority has yet to publish its exact charges - the Internet giant could be pinned down for years to come in regulatory procedures and legal appeals.A drawn-out process is likely to embolden existing and would-be interlopers to step up assaults on Google's wide range of businesses, if the history of Microsoft's antitrust battles with U.S. and European regulators is any guide.In accusing Google of anti-competitive practices against rival shopping sites, the EU competition authority said it is continuing to investigate other areas, including alleged ""web scraping"" to copy content off of rival travel and local business review sites, and Google's restrictive practices on advertising.A quick EU finding that Google has abused its market power by favouring its own shopping services at the expense of non-Google websites, could set a precedent for new charges over how it handles hotels, flights and other services, experts say.This, in turn, could renew politically charged debates over Google's tax avoidance moved and privacy safeguards.""The concern is how broad does this investigation go?"" asked Macquarie Securities analyst Ben Schachter, who tracks Google. Google readily acknowledges it is the most used search engine in Europe, but argues that people find information on the Internet via many avenues, including social media, mobile phone apps, shopping sites and by going directly to popular sites.""Allegations of harm, for consumers and competitors, have proved to be wide of the mark,"" Google said in a statement responding to the European Commission. ""We respectfully but strongly disagree.""So far, nothing the EU proposed in its preliminary statement of objections suggests it is ready to force Google to change its business model, any hint of which would spook investors and be a threat to its ability to innovate and compete, analysts say.""We see little long-term risk to the business model from regulators,"" Baird Equity Research analyst Colin Sebastian wrote in a note to investors. More likely, the EU will impose fines or set competitive restrictions on how Google features its own properties versus those of rivals, he said.IMPASSE By contrast, Microsoft was accused of tying its web browser to its Windows software monopoly in a bid to dominate the emerging Web era and faced calls to be split in two in the course of legal battles stretching from 1998 to 2010. That created openings for Internet leaders Google, Facebook, Apple and Amazon.com to emerge. It's too early to say whether Google faces the same fate as the world moves beyond computers into the mobile Internet era. Working in Google's favour is its control over Android, the software used to power more than 80 percent of all smartphones. That positions it well for the current shift, but puts it on uncertain ground as the EU starts to probe Android as well.EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager has said she wants a change in the ""principle"" underlying searches rather than a redesign of current Web pages or tweaks to algorithms by which Google ranks results.During the five-year inquiry leading to the accusations, Google agreed three times to settlement terms, only to be rebuffed by EU authorities who saw its proposed changes as too narrow or cosmetic.This week's crackdown on Google drew a chorus of cheers from a handful of start-up shopping sites that had filed complaints alleging Google excluded them from its search. They see the EU's action giving them a second chance, both in terms of business opportunities and the ability to attract fresh venture funding.But Google's woes are not likely to help Europe's burgeoning start-up scene, in part because Google is an active funder and serial acquirer of young companies here, but also because most firms count on Google's low-cost ads to fund their own services.Instead, Google's bigger opponents including German publisher Axel Springer and other European media and telecom firms with more to gain from having it on the defensive. GLOVES COME OFF The likeliest beneficiaries do not come from Europe at all. They are well-known, high-tech names that increasingly compete with Google in what is largely a single, global digital market.These include Apple and Samsung in phones, Amazon.com in shopping, Facebook and Twitter in social media, and, in software, Microsoft and Oracle, two active backers of the EU case against Google.Amazon, Facebook, and Apple share many similar business practices to Google in terms of favouring their own products over those of competitors, analyst Sebastian said. Each, in its way, is gaining ground on Google in realms they control.But because none of these rivals have the decisive monopoly market power that Google has over web search, they don't, at least so far, face the same scrutiny from regulators, he says.Amazon's site search uses its own ""buy box"" to favour either its own inventory or that of other key partners. Apple's mobile apps (iTunes, Maps, AppStore) are installed as default software on its closely controlled phones and tablets, akin to how Android phones default to Google's search, maps and app store.Facebook targets advertising using members' personal details, which gives it a distinct advantage over other online and offline media companies, including Google. From nowhere a decade ago, Facebook now ranks second behind Google in terms of advertising customers, the revenue lifeblood of both companies. Google has 4 million customers while Facebook has 2 million customers, according to Macquarie analyst Schachter's estimates.Facebook has also begun beefing up its search capabilities, posing a big challenge to Google by keeping users inside its network instead of going to the open web, where Google is king.Google is now gearing up to allow websites to target ads to their existing users, using customer email addresses, taking direct aim at a similar Facebook audience targetting advertising product, analysts say.Google may have held off from launching this product to avoid provoking regulators, which has now happened despite efforts to appease the EU, said Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser.""Google knows that anything that they want to do is going to met with regulatory scrutiny, so why hold back?"" Wieser said.

588,"  (Refiles to correct link in paragraph 4)FRANKFURT, April 22 Nokia's maps business has drawn interest from potential buyers including Facebook and a consortium of German carmakers made up of BMW, Audi and Daimler, a German magazine reported on Wednesday.Citing people familiar with the matter, Manager Magazin also confirmed an earlier report that online taxi service Uber is looking at the books of HERE, Nokia's mapping unit, and that U.S. private equity firm Hellman & Friedman was also interested.Nokia is also trying to drum up interest from Apple Inc , Alibaba Group Holding Ltd and Amazon.com Inc , Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter.Nokia is seeking more than 3 billion euros ($3.2 billion) from a sale of the unit, Bloomberg reported. (bloom.bg/1GjYnEx)According to Manager Magazin, the book value of the unit is 2 billion euros. A brokerage estimate by Inderes Equity Research values HERE at 4.4 billion to 6.9 billion euros, based on a sum-of-parts calculation.Nokia, BMW, Daimler, Facebook and Uber declined to comment on the report. Apple, Alibaba, Amazon.com, Audi and San Francisco-based Hellman & Friedman were not immediately available for comment.Finland's Nokia said last week it had started a strategic review of its Berlin-based HERE unit after announcing a 15.6 billion euro takeover of network equipment rival Alcatel-Lucent . ""I want to be very clear: if we are to sell this business, we are not a forced seller,"" Nokia Chief Executive Rajeev Suri told a news conference last Friday.Separately, Continental AG, one of the world's biggest auto parts makers and a partner of Nokia's HERE in vehicle navigation systems, declined to comment on whether it might make a takeover bid.Juergen Pieper, an analyst with Frankfurt-based Bankhaus Metzler, said a three-way bidding alliance of Germany's big automakers could make sense: ""Luxury automakers are stepping up efforts to fetch back activities related to digitisation they previously had assigned to suppliers,"" he said. MAP ASSETS Access to high-quality maps is essential for carmakers seeking to build autonomous cars, which need detailed location data about their wider surroundings to complement input from on-board sensors to avoid obstacles and other vehicles.Such navigation and safety features are a pre-condition for the eventual emergence of driverless vehicles in coming years.The Finnish company built its mapping and location business on the back of an $8.1 billion acquisition in 2008 of U.S.-based Navteq, a maker of geographic information systems used in the automotive industry. It was Nokia's largest deal ever, prior to the planned Alcatel-Lucent merger. Nokia saw adding maps to its phones as a way to differentiate its products from other high-end phone makers, including Apple, which the previous year had revolutionised the market with the launch of the iPhone.The HERE unit, one of Nokia's three remaining businesses after the sale of its handsets unit, has in recent years refocused to supply maps to carmakers, which accounted for more than half of HERE sales in 2013.HERE also supplies online maps to major Internet companies including Amazon.com, Baidu, Microsoft , Samsung Electronics, Yahoo and for use in mobile and computer online mapping applications.A push by Google, which introduced a fully functioning prototype of a driverless car last year after working on the project for a decade, has put the race to build connected cars into high gear. Daimler's Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Audi all have prototype autonomous cars, as do many other big carmakers.Embedded navigation features in new cars are expected to built into more than a third of new cars produced in 2020, up from around 20 percent of vehicles in 2013, according to estimates from Nokia and third-party research data.($1 = 0.9293 euro)   (Additional reporting by Andreas Cremer in Berlin, Irene Preisinger in Munich, Ilona Wissenbach in Stuttgart, Jan Schwartz in Hamburg, Maria Sheahan, Georgina Prodhan and Arno Schuetze in Frankfurt, Jussi Rosendahl in Helsinki and Supriya Kurane in Bengaluru; Writing by Eric Auchard; Editing by Keith Weir)",2015-04-22,FB,"Wed Apr 22, 2015 | 5:52pm EDT",REFILE-UPDATE 3-Nokia's maps unit draws further bidders-Manager Magazin,http://www.reuters.com//article/nokia-maps-idUSL5N0XJ1GI20150422?type=companyNews

""We are just happy to be able to move on,"" Greifeld said, adding that insurance would cover most, if not all, of the settlement.The reserve will also cover expected costs of re-opening the voluntary compensation program for firms that did not submit a claim to Nasdaq in 2013.UBS Group AG's market-making arm sued to recoup more than $350 million of losses from the IPO, rather than submit a claim to Nasdaq. In October, an appeals court rejected UBS's bid bring Nasdaq to arbitration.""We are happy that UBS is probably going to apply to become a part of the accommodation policy,"" Greifeld said, ""and we are certainly happy to open it up again for them.""Separately, Nasdaq agreed in May 2013 to pay a record $10 million penalty to settle U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charges over Facebook's IPO. The exchange operator did not admit wrongdoing.

591,"  (Adds analyst comment, background)April 27 Facebook Inc introduced free video calling in its Messenger phone app on Monday as the company seeks to transform its mobile messaging service into a full-featured platform with the same reach as its 1.4 billion user social network.Messenger, with more than 600 million users, now has a video icon at the top right corner of its screen. Earlier this year, Messenger launched voice and video calling between computers. (bit.ly/1KorYLD) Messenger competes with Microsoft Corp's Skype, Apple Inc's FaceTime and Google Inc's  Hangouts, all of which allow video calls between mobile devices or computers. At Facebook's annual developer conference in March, Chief Executive Mark Zuckerburg said the social network would introduce myriad features within Messenger. For example, users can also send money to friends within the app. Facebook also unveiled a platform that enables developers to easily create apps that function within Messenger. ""Adding (video calling) to Messenger instead of the main Facebook app maybe ties in to Messenger's mission where it's a real core person-to-person app,"" said Brian Blau, research director at Gartner Inc, a U.S. technology research and advisory firm. ""Now they're really enticing people with more features.""Video calling is available on devices using Apple's iOS and Google's Android mobile operating systems in Belgium, Canada, Croatia, Denmark, France, Greece, Ireland, Laos, Lithuania, Mexico, Nigeria, Norway, Oman, Poland, Portugal, the United Kingdom, the United States and Uruguay. Facebook said additional regions will be added in the next few months.

In her book ""Lean In,"" Sandberg attributed much of her own success to her marriage to Goldberg, who she said supported her career decisions and shared equally in the work of raising their young children. The two married in 2004.Tributes to Goldberg poured in over social media from friends and other executives, including Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg, who called Goldberg ""an amazing person."" ""Kindest, most generous, loving father, loyal husband, great ceo, & sweetest friend,"" tweeted Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff. ""May his memory be a blessing.""Television and movie writer John Quaintance said on Facebook that Goldberg was the first person to encourage him to write professionally, changing the course of his career. Goldberg was also the first person Quaintance met who owned a Blackberry device. ""I rolled my eyes at the idea that people were ever going to need to read their emails away from the office,"" he wrote.  Goldberg, 47, joined SurveyMonkey, which helps organizations conduct surveys, in 2009. Valued at $2 billion, SurveyMonkey is backed by Bain Capital Ventures, Google Ventures, Tiger Global and others. The family did not disclose the cause of death.

593,"   By Sarah McBride and Yasmeen Abutaleb | STANFORD, Calif  STANFORD, Calif Facebook Inc Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg re-emerged in public on Tuesday after the accidental death of her husband last week, offering a personal tribute to him in a Silicon Valley memorial service and on her Facebook page.Many of the tech world's top executives filled a 1,700-seat auditorium at Stanford University to commemorate David Goldberg, chief executive of SurveyMonkey. He died at age 47 on Friday after a treadmill accident during a vacation in Mexico. ""We had 11 truly joyful years of the deepest love, happiest marriage, and truest partnership that I could imagine,"" Sandberg posted on Facebook. ""He gave me the experience of being deeply understood, truly supported and completely and utterly loved - and I will carry that with me always."" Her post appeared hours after the ceremony, a tribute to the low-key executive, whose marriage to Sandberg added to his fame from building a company valued at $2 billion.Speakers described Goldberg's self-deprecation, modesty and selflessness, and the event, closed to the media, included several nods to his passions.On their way out, guests were offered Minnesota Vikings baseball caps as a reminder of the Minneapolis-born Goldberg's lighthearted nature and love of sports, according to a person who attended the service and who declined to be identified. Also on hand were playing cards stamped with his initials, and poker chips. During the ceremony, U2’s Bono sang ""One,"" the Irish rock band’s anthem to love and support.Goldberg's brother, Robert Goldberg, who announced the death on Saturday morning on Facebook, and several friends spoke at the private service, the person said.   Many guests entered through side and back doors after driving into a cordoned-off area behind the hall. Some, such as Hewlett Packard Chief Executive Meg Whitman, walked up the steps and through the main entrance.  Many began offering personal tributes to Goldberg on social media on Saturday, including Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg. Sandberg, however, remained silent until Tuesday morning, when she responded to a public note by President Barack Obama. ""David Goldberg embodied the definition of a real leader - someone who was always looking for ways to empower others,"" the president wrote in a Facebook message signed B.O., meaning he personally wrote it. ""We're heartbroken by him leaving us far too soon - but we celebrate a remarkable legacy."" Sandberg in turn took to Facebook, thanking Obama for his friendship. ""Dave Goldberg admired you for your leadership, passion, and your deep love of sports,"" she wrote. She also changed her Facebook cover photo on Tuesday morning to a picture of her dancing with Goldberg at their wedding in 2004. Goldberg built SurveyMonkey into a poll-taking juggernaut after joining the company in 2009. He previously worked for venture firm Benchmark, after founding Launch Media and selling it to Yahoo Inc in 2001.""As we put the love of my life to rest today, we buried only his body,"" Sandberg wrote. ""His spirit, his soul, his amazing ability to give is still with it.""

596,"   By Julia Fioretti | BRUSSELS  BRUSSELS Belgium's privacy watchdog accused Facebook (FB.O) on Friday of trampling on European privacy laws by tracking people online without their consent and dodging questions from national regulators.The Privacy Protection Commission (CPVP/CBPL), which is working with German, Dutch, French and Spanish counterparts, launched the blistering attack after trying to find out more about the U.S. social media giant's practices.It urged Internet users to install privacy software to shield themselves from Facebook's tracking systems, whether they have an account with the social network or not.The show of strength from the Belgian regulator, which does not have the power to levy fines, highlights a growing willingness across the 28-member bloc to demand that big U.S. tech companies abide by European laws.""Facebook tramples on European and Belgian privacy laws"", the Commission said after publishing a report analyzing changes that the company made to its privacy policies in January.It said in a statement that Facebook had refused to recognize Belgian and other EU national jurisdictions, insisting it was subject only to the law in Ireland, the site of its European headquarters.""Facebook has shown itself particularly miserly in giving precise answers,"" the watchdog said, adding that the results of the study by a group of researchers were ""disconcerting"".A Facebook spokeswoman questioned the Belgians' authority but said it would review the study's recommendations with the Irish data protection commissioner: ""We work hard to make sure people have control over what they share and with whom."" ""Facebook is already regulated in Europe and complies with European data protection law, so the applicability of the CBPL's efforts is unclear,"" she said.Some EU states accuse Ireland of being soft on the multinational firms it wants to attract, whether in data protection or corporate taxation.SECOND REPORT  The commission said it would publish a second report on Facebook this year. Sanctions available to privacy watchdogs can be negligible to big firms, but a new EU data protection law expected to be ready this year would allow for fines up to 5 percent of annual sales.The commission said Facebook would not explain in detail how it uses data it collects. It highlighted problems with plug-ins such as Facebook's ""Like"" button, which it said affected many who do not have a Facebook account.A number of firms are under fire in Europe over the data they collect. Facebook places tracking ""cookies"" when anyone visits a Facebook page, meaning it can track the online activities of a huge number of non-customers, but has said this is a bug that it is working to fix.The Commission asked Facebook to stop gathering user data via cookies and plug-ins, except where users asked for it.  European regulators have previously forced Google (GOOGL.O) to change its privacy policies.And a year ago, EU judges upheld a Spanish order that Google must remove links to outdated information from searches for people's names -- establishing a ""right to be forgotten"".EU anti-trust regulators launched a case against Google last month and are probing Apple (AAPL.O) and Amazon (AMZN.O) over low-tax deals with Ireland and Luxembourg. The European Commission is studying whether to pursue German and French proposals for an EU-wide regulator for Internet platforms.Some European politicians, also angered by revelations of U.S. espionage in Europe, say U.S. firms abuse their power, discouraging local start-ups and jeopardizing privacy laws cherished by Europeans with memories of authoritarian rule.U.S. President Barack Obama, who is trying to negotiate a landmark transatlantic free trade deal with the EU, TTIP, says Europe is throwing up protectionist barriers to tech companies.

599,"   By Jennifer Saba | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Overseas markets bring in more advertising revenue than the United States for Facebook Inc, amounting to 51 percent of global ad sales in the first quarter, with growth in Asia the fastest in the world at 57 percent, company executives told Reuters.While Facebook has reported regional growth in percentage terms, this is the first time it has detailed ad sales outside the United States and Canada as a percent of worldwide sales.Like the advertisers it courts, the world's largest social media platform looks at international markets for growth.""The next 1 billion consumers are going to come from these countries,"" said Carolyn Everson, vice president, global marketing solutions at Facebook. Total advertising revenue for the quarter increased 46 percent to $3.3 billion, the vast majority of Facebook's $3.5 billion in quarterly revenue. Fifty-one percent of total ad revenue would be about $1.7 billion for international markets. International advertising revenue rose 36 percent from a year earlier, Facebook said.While Europe is growing slower than the United States, the Asia Pacific region is ahead and a focus for Facebook. By comparison, Google said that 57 percent of its revenue was from international markets in the first quarter, although it did not break out ad revenue specifically.Mobile advertising represents more than 70 percent of Facebook's total ad revenue, and mobile is particularly strong and attractive to advertisers in emerging markets, Everson said.Facebook is benefiting from exporters in China trying to reach people outside its country and from an influx of venture capital funding into India, giving start-ups funds for advertising. Chinese businesses are getting more sophisticated about promoting their brands, said Dan Neary, vice president of Facebook's Asia Pacific region. ""Increasingly manufactures are becoming savvy marketers in their own right,"" he said.While Facebook has offices in Hong Kong, Everson said there is ""no news to share"" on further expansion in China.In India, e-commerce startups are exploding and many are using Facebook's advertising platform to reach new consumers, Neary said. The company has also initiated specific methods tailored to the country including optimizing video and pictures for slower connections in India, where an ad product called ""missed call"" also helps customers avoid phone call charges.Many people in India dial a friend and hang up to send a signal without incurring charges.Facebook incorporated this system into its ads. A person can place a ""missed call"" by clicking on a mobile ad from Facebook and receive a return call with information, for example the score of a cricket game, sponsored by a brand.Facebook also plans to capitalize on the visual images, specifically photography and videos, that are being embraced by younger audiences across the world. Instagram, the popular photo app, announced on June 2 it is opening up its platform to all types of businesses, not just hand-selected brands and will begin rolling out more specific targeting capability globally this year.

603,"  (Adds quotes from Oculus executives, details on headset)By Yasmeen AbutalebSAN FRANCISCO, June 11 Oculus, the virtual reality company owned by Facebook Inc, debuted the much anticipated consumer version of its headset on Thursday and announced a partnership with Microsoft Corp's Xbox One gaming console.A prototype of the Oculus Rift has been available to developers since 2013, but Thursday marked the first time anyone had seen the consumer version, which will be available for pre-order later this year and will start shipping in early 2016.Oculus Chief Executive Brendan Iribe said during the unveiling in San Francisco that the Rift will include a wireless Xbox controller and adapter. Consumers will also be able to directly stream Xbox One games into the Rift, such as the popular game Halo, a first-person shooter game. Facebook Inc bought Oculus last year for $2 billion and its chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, has said he views virtual reality as the next major computing platform.Oculus Founder Palmer Luckey unexpectedly announced that the Rift will include wireless hand controllers that resemble bracelets to raucous applause.The controllers will enable consumers to use their hands to interact with games, whether it's pulling a trigger on a virtual gun or using communicative gestures with other players. ""One of the first things people do is they reach out into this virtual world,"" Luckey said. ""We wanted to create an input device that allows people to reach out.""At the start of the event, Iribe held the headset in one hand, pointing to its light weight and ability to adjust to any head size. The Rift will also fit over a pair of eyeglasses, he added, and includes adjustable headphones and lenses. Iribe said the Rift is tightly integrated with Microsoft's Windows and hinted that ""there is a lot more to come"" with the computer company.Several game developers showed demo videos of how their products will work in the Rift. Nate Mitchell, Oculus vice president of product, also announced ""Oculus Home,"" a portal where games are bought and downloaded.Iribe did not say how much the headset will cost. At a conference last month, he said he expects the Rift and the computer needed to run it will cost around $1,500.Company executives said they plan to release more details about the Rift at next week's E3 video game conference in Los Angeles and at a developer conference in September.

While energy shares rose alongside a jump in the price of crude oil, a sharp rise in the U.S. dollar capped broader gains. While there were no major developments involving Greece, investors continued to hope that the country's newest budget proposals - introduced on Monday - would avert a looming default.Greece needs fresh funds to avoid defaulting on a $1.8 billion debt repayment to the International Monetary Fund on June 30. Equities have been largely driven by Greece lately, with investors concerned that if the country defaults, it may have to leave the euro or the European Union, potentially shaking the region's economic foundations.""The market seems to expect that this will end favorably, or at least benignly, but I think people need to be nimble right now as circumstances could change at any time,"" said Steve Sosnick, equity-risk manager at Timber Hill/Interactive Brokers Group in Greenwich, Connecticut. ""Greece may not be all that meaningful to the U.S. market, but it could have a big impact on the euro and the dollar, and it is unclear how big of an impact that will have on stocks.""The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, rose 1.1 percent. A strong dollar is considered a headwind for equity prices as it weighs on the profits of multinational corporations.U.S. crude futures settled up 1 percent at $61.01 per barrel, lifted ahead of U.S. inventory data expected to show strong demand for gasoline. The S&P energy index  rose 0.3 percent and was one of the day's top-performing sectors. Halliburton Co rose 0.9 percent to $44.49. AT&T Inc rose 2.5 percent to $35.91 and was one of the biggest percentage gainers on the S&P 500 after at least two brokerages upgraded the stock.Facebook Inc shares rose 3.7 percent to $87.88, a record close. With the day's gains, the social network's market value is now bigger than that of Dow component Wal-Mart Stores Inc.The Dow Jones industrial average rose 24.29 points, or 0.13 percent, to 18,144.07, the S&P 500 gained 1.35 points, or 0.06 percent, to 2,124.2 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 6.12 points, or 0.12 percent, to 5,160.10.

617,"   By Joseph Menn | SAN FRANCISCO, July 8  SAN FRANCISCO, July 8 A hacking group best known for breaking into top-tier technology companies Apple Inc , Facebook Inc and Twitter Inc more than two years ago is now believed to be one of a handful of highly skilled independent gangs pursuing corporate secrets for profit.According to new research from the largest U.S. security software vendor, Symantec Corp, the group appears to be among the few that display significant talent without backing from a national government. The group stays below the radar with a small number of carefully targeted attacks.""They are very focused, wanting everything valuable from the top companies of the world,"" said Vikram Thakur, a Symantec senior manager. ""The only way they could use it, in our opinion, is through some financial market or by selling it.""Thakur said Symantec and other security companies such as FireEye Inc were tracking less than a half dozen such groups, including one called FIN4.FIN4 has less technical skill but uses knowledge of the investment banking world and strong social engineering, or trickery, to harvest email credentials and discover material financial information. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating some FIN4 breaches at large, publicly traded companies. Symantec said its group, which it calls Morpho, dropped out of sight for months after press accounts of the Silicon Valley breaches in early 2103 shone a light on their techniques, which included use of a previously unknown ""zero-day"" flaw in Oracle's Java platform.Morpho also used a ""watering hole"" approach, infecting websites that were likely to attract employees of its targets as visitors. In the best-known case, a website frequented by iPhone developers was infected. Some had suspected China or another country in the Silicon Valley attacks. Some of the companies breached, including Apple, said they found no evidence of data being stolen.In a paper being released Wednesday, Symantec said Morpho came back from its absence to breach a small number of additional technology companies. It has also gone after the pharmaceutical industry and airlines, typically hitting multiple competitors in a sector and infecting a very few machines, usually in the research departments.Morpho has breached about 49 organizations that Symantec knows about since 2012, with the number penetrated each year rising to 14 by 2015. The United States, Europe and Canada have the most victims. Thakur said his team thinks the group might have about 10 members around the world, with some fluent in English and one or more perhaps having worked at an intelligence agency. They could be offering themselves for hire or could be breaking into companies on speculation and trying to sell the information or trade shares based on it.Among the team's greatest strengths is its operational security, as it uses multiple proxies to disguise its location, employs heavy encryption where it stores digital loot, and strikes within a day or two of entry before wiping its tracks.A break in Symantec's research came when a regular backup was made of a targeted machine during a 12-hour window when some of Morpho's custom-made navigation tools were still in use. Symantec then looked for where the same tools had been employed.Thakur said law enforcement agencies in the United States and Europe had been apprised of Symantec's findings. An FBI spokesman did not respond to a request for comment, nor did Twitter and Facebook. An Apple spokesman declined to discuss the research.

Etsy  spiked nearly 40 percent thanks to a nod from Google during its conference call.Crude oil prices slipped in choppy trading due to a strong dollar and fears of increased exports, pushing the S&P 500 energy index down 1.5 percent to its lowest level since January 2013. Exxon, down 0.3 percent, and Chevron , down 1.2 percent, were the biggest drag on the sector.""While earnings have beaten low expectations, the market is looking for forward guidance,"" said David O'Malley, chief executive of Penn Mutual Asset Management.O'Malley said the markets need to see better earnings for it to move higher and break out of the sideways action that has characterized much of the year. At 13:03 p.m. ET (1703 GMT) the Nasdaq composite was up 26.79 points, or 0.52 percent, at 5,189.97. The index touched a record intraday high of 5,198.73.The Dow Jones industrial average was down 62.33 points, or 0.34 percent, at 18,057.92 and the S&P 500 was down 1.84 points, or 0.09 percent, at 2,122.45.Boeing fell 1.2 percent to $146.52, and was the biggest drag on the Dow, after the company said it will take a second-quarter charge related to problems with its KC-46 aerial refueling tanker aircraft program. General Electric shares rose 0.9 percent to $27.27, the biggest among the six gainers on the Dow 30, after raising its 2015 outlook for its industrial manufacturing businesses.The technology index was the only gainer among the 10 major S&P 500 indexes. It was 1.3 percent, boosted by Google.The three major indexes were poised to end the week higher following strong earnings reports from most of the blue-chip companies such as Netflix and ebay.The dollar was on track for its biggest weekly gain in two months on the likelihood of a Federal Reserve rate hike this year. However, a strong dollar reduces the vale of U.S. companies' overseas income.Despite early, upbeat results this week, U.S. companies are expected to post their worst sales decline in nearly six years in the second quarter, in part due to the strong dollar. Profit is expected to have fallen 2.9 percent, according to Thomson Reuters estimates.Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 2,179 to 815. On the Nasdaq, 1,789 issues fell and 912 advanced.The S&P 500 index showed 17 new 52-week highs and 24 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 79 new highs and 63 new lows.

629,"  (Corrects paragraph 1 to say stock surge added ""nearly $60 billion"", not ""about $50 billion"", to Google's market value and paragraph 3 to say Google now valued at ""about $460 billion"", ""not $423 billion"")July 17 Google Inc's shares surged as much as 14.5 percent on Friday, adding nearly $60 billion to its market value, as strong growth in mobile ad revenue allayed concerns its YouTube business could be hurt by Facebook Inc's  push into video.The surge in the stock, which sent the Nasdaq composite index to a record intraday high, came a day after Google reported better-than-expected revenue and profit for the first time in six quarters.Shares of Google, the world's most valuable company after Apple Inc, hit a record high of $688.81, valuing the Web search giant at about $460 billion.At least 24 brokerages raised their price targets on Google's stock by as much as $150 to as high as $800, with analysts also welcoming new Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat's emphasis on disciplined spending.Online video ads could be a $17 billion opportunity in the United States alone by 2017 and YouTube looks best positioned to benefit, Jefferies & Co analysts wrote in a note.""Second, new CFO Ruth Porat will take a more disciplined approach to expense management and capital allocation - welcome news,"" they wrote. Google said watch time for YouTube rose 60 percent in the second quarter and the video service roped in more viewers aged 18-49 than any U.S. cable network on mobile alone.Google and Facebook are trying to woo big companies to market their products via online videos.YouTube has an edge over Facebook as it has a more mature monetization platform that seems to attract the best content, Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster said. Google said the gap was closing between mobile and desktop ""cost per click"" (CPC), or the average price of online ads.Mobile CPCs are likely to exceed desktop CPCs in the long term, Munster said.Google's CPCs fell 11 percent in the quarter but that is not the complete story, Jefferies analysts said. YouTube TrueView ads, where advertisers pay only when users don't skip an ad, cost less than traditional search ads.Google's fast rampup of YouTube monetization is also hurting pricing, they said.The company's advertising revenue rose 11 percent to $16.02 billion. The number of paid clicks increased 18 percent.""This growth has steadily held in the mid-to-high teens since at least Q1:13,"" RBC analyst Mark Mahaney said.

No move on rates was expected this week. U.S. interest rates have remained near zero for almost a decade and the Fed has said it will raise rates once it sees a sustained recovery in the economy.""The statement tried to just give an update on the state of the economy, which is showing some modest improvement,"" said Guy Haselmann, head of U.S. interest rate strategy at Scotiabank in New York.

After the bell, Facebook and Whole Foods Market  dropped 4 percent and 11 percent, respectively, following quarterly reports that left investors wanting more.During the session, Twitter shares fell 14.5 percent to a year-low of $31.24 after the microblogging company said its number of monthly average users rose at the slowest pace since it went public in 2013.General Dynamics rose 3.93 percent after its earnings.

642,"   By Svea Herbst-Bayliss | BOSTON  BOSTON Hedge fund managers often promise to find stock ideas off the beaten path but this month many prominent players have been bloodied by doing exactly the opposite; betting on a small handful of popular names that sold off sharply in August.The carnage of the last week - even with Wednesday's and Thursday's rebound - has been particularly acute for investors who have seen their overweight positions in companies such as social media site Facebook, pharmaceutical company Valeant, internet retailer Netflix, carmaker Tesla Motors and renewable energy company SunEdison get pummeled in the last days.As a result, people who have money with David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital, Leon Cooperman's Omega Advisors, Chase Coleman's Tiger Global, Philippe Laffont's Coatue and others are bracing for red ink when August data comes out next week. Only a few managers have actually told investors about their losses.""People will be shocked by how bad the numbers will be,"" said Peter Rup, chief executive and chief investment officer at Artemis Wealth Advisors, which invests in hedge funds, adding ""they will be down 8 percent (for the month) and for some people it may be a lot worse.""The average hedge fund is off almost 2 percent for the year, according to Hedge Fund Research data, while the Standard & Poor's 500 index is down almost 5 percent. One reason the declines may be so big is that managers have tended to crowd into similar stocks, some lulled by years of rising markets, several investors said.For example, Omega Advisors, which investors say is off 12 percent this month, was hurt most by SunEdison's SUNE.K 47 percent plunge this month, investors said. The stock fell 14 drop in the last five days alone, even though it came back on Thursday, and also hurt Greenlight Capital and Daniel Loeb's Third Point, investors said. Earlier in the week, Omega's Steven Einhorn said his firm believed stocks would rebound. The S&P lost more than 11 percent in a six-day run of losses before recovering, gaining 6 percent on Wednesday and Thursday combined.      Greenlight investors, tracking the fund's returns, said Einhorn is likely down by double digits this month, further worsening a year in which he was down 9 percent through July. A spokesman declined to comment.Similarly, an 8 percent drop in Valeant (VRX.TO) in the last five days, plus Facebook's 9.5 percent decline and a 12 percent tumble in Netflix, also hurt big funds.At William Ackman's Pershing Square Capital Management, Valeant makes up roughly one third of the portfolio and the billionaire investor said on Wednesday that his 10 percent gain through the end of July was gone – he's down 13.1 percent in August through the 25th.The declines in Facebook and Netflix were big detractors for Philippe Laffont's Coatue Management, while Netflix was the number one drag on Tiger Global in the last five days, according to Symmetric, which tracks and analyzes public U.S. hedge fund stock holding reports. Shares of Netflix are still up 141 percent for 2015. CROWDED NAMES Hedge fund investors have long complained that when stocks fall, many big-name funds lose money at the same time. Whether managers swap stock picks at private dinners or find tips at conferences, they worry funds no longer deliver the uncorrelated investments they promise. ""Hedge funds do love the crowded names and the bigger a fund gets, the more likely it is we see them in common names,"" said Brad Balter, managing partner at Balter Capital, which invests with hedge funds.But some investors also say there is good reason to crowd into some stocks, largely because they are the ones expected to perform well.

Ackman, for example, said he had not made significant adjustments to his portfolio.Long-term investors expect hedge funds to perform better, especially if markets trend lower.""If we look at how hedge funds have performed over these times of drawdowns, they've done a whole lot better than the average fund,"" said David Saunders, founding managing director, K2 Advisors, which invests with dozens of hedge funds.   (Reporting by Svea Herbst-Bayliss.

644,"   By Malathi Nayak | NEW YORK, Sept 8  NEW YORK, Sept 8 Verizon Communications Inc  will launch a trial version of its new mobile video service on Tuesday, aiming to prove that telecom players can compete with mobile ad industry titans Google Inc and Facebook Inc.Verizon said its service, a mobile app dubbed ""go90"", will be offered initially to a select set of its own customers, with advertisements from well-known brands, which it declined to name, but without newly acquired ad technology from AOL, the media company it bought in June for $4.4 billion.Verizon is targeting young viewers or millennials with about 100 to 200 hours of exclusive content from online video networks such as AwesomenessTV and Machinima, said Brian Angiolet, Verizon's senior vice president, consumer products. The free service will drive revenue from data usage and targeted advertising.Verizon's best chance to prove its advertising potential rests on technology from AOL, which has built tools to deliver targeted Web and mobile ads. That, combined with Verizon's customer data, should improve targeting, analysts say.The AOL technology is in the process of being integrated with Verizon's video service, and targeted advertising tools will be available over time, Angiolet said. The service will launch officially to all users as soon as later this month, a Verizon spokesman said.Companies from Netflix Inc to Dish Network Corp   already offer Web-based video services through subscriptions, but the No. 1 U.S. wireless company's ad-supported, short-form video model is unusual. Go90 pits Verizon against Internet advertising industry heavyweights Google and Facebook, and advertisers will take a ""wait and see"" approach to determine how many viewers Verizon captures, telecom industry consultant Tim Farrar said.""Pretty much without exception telecom operators have not been successful as third parties in exploiting the Internet access service, whether it's video or anything else,"" Farrar said. ""What percentage of people's app viewing is going to be over a Verizon app versus YouTube or Facebook...That's the biggest uncertainty.""Verizon's rival AT&T Inc has said it has mobile video services targeting young viewers in the works. Smaller rivals Sprint Corp and T-Mobile US Inc have said they are watching their competitors' efforts closely. Verizon is in talks with advertisers and brands about content sponsorships and original-content creation, Angiolet said. The service lets users post comments, form interest-based groups and clip and share videos in social networks, he added.Verizon's video strategy ""holds genuine promise,"" MoffettNathanson analyst Craig Moffett said in a recent note. Verizon is currently the only video service to offer advertisers customer data ""based on location, at the personal level rather than the household level, with unprecedented knowledge of purchase intent and a wealth of demographic and prior purchase information,"" Moffett said.Verizon's content portfolio will evolve in coming months, executives have said. Previously, Verizon said its upcoming digital video service will offer content from the National Football League, DreamWorks Animation's AwesomenessTV unit and Vice Media.As its trial period begins, content partners include Comedy Central, Food Network, ESPN, Discovery Network and VH1. From the web, it will offer videos from Maker Studios, Machinima and StyleHaul, among others.

651,"   By Anya George Tharakan  Oct 14 Peter Thiel, the Silicon Valley investor who co-founded PayPal and invested in Facebook in 2004, has now invested in BuildZoom, a Y Combinator-backed startup that helps U.S. customers find contractors for remodeling projects.BuildZoom said on Wednesday it raised $10.6 million in a Series A funding round led by Joe Lonsdale of venture capital firm Formation 8, with participation from Thiel's Founder's Fund and Y Combinator, the startup machine behind companies such as Dropbox, Airbnb, Reddit and Stripe.Lonsdale, a former PayPal executive and co-founder of data company Palantir Technologies, will also join the board of BuildZoom, the company said. BuildZoom, started in 2011 by childhood friends Jiyan Wei and David Petersen, has now raised $14.3 million since 2013, when it was incorporated.Y Combinator had invested $18,000 in BuildZoom in 2013 and its latest funding is one of the incubator's first instances of post-seed funding. BuildZoom raised $2.15 million last October, which valued the company at $26-$28 million. That round was also led by Formation 8, co-founded by Lonsdale and best known for backing virtual reality company Oculus VR.BuildZoom helps people find a contractor by analyzing their building permits and project history, relying more on big data than on reviews and recommendations. Its database of more than 3.5 million contractors is the largest in the United States. The contractors pay BuildZoom a commission based on the size of the project, with smaller projects attracting higher commissions.The company's annualized revenue grew 800 percent in September compared with a year earlier, BuildZoom co-founder and President Wei said in an interview.Wei said BuildZoom has had four or five takeover approaches in the last two quarters, but the founders are not looking to cash out.

Facebook did not disclose Instagram's ad sales figures. But the app is expected to bring in $595 million in mobile ad revenues this year, research firm eMarketer said. Its ad revenue is projected to grow to $2.8 billion by 2017.Facebook's huge $3.0 billion spending, up 68 percent from the third quarter last year, did not seem to worry investors or analysts.""I think the investors would like the company to continue to invest given that the opportunity is pretty large,"" said Shyam Patil of Susquehanna Financial Group.The stock rose about 5 percent to an all-time high of $109.34 in extended trading, before paring gains to about 4 percent. It closed earlier at $103.94. Total revenue jumped to $4.50 billion in the third quarter, from $3.20 billion a year earlier.

670,"   By Svea Herbst-Bayliss | BOSTON  BOSTON Nov 23 Hedge fund managers' favorite stocks stumbled hard this year to post their worst returns since the financial crisis with health-care companies, such as Valeant Pharmaceuticals, leading the way lower, according to new data from Goldman Sachs.Goldman analysts calculated that the basket of managers' 50 most heavily owned stocks - among which are Allergan, Facebook, Netflix and Cheniere Energy - lost 2.4 percent since January, while the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index gained 3 percent during the same time.Since August, when Goldman rebalanced what it calls its Hedge Fund VIP list, the industry's favorite stocks have lost 5 percent, compared with the S&P 500's 1 percent gain, Goldman said in a report released on Monday. ""Health-care stocks within the basket, most notably VRX, were responsible for nearly 70 percent of the basket's negative return,"" the report said, referring to Valeant.Valeant's stock price tumbled some 70 percent in the 3-1/2 months from July through mid-October amid questions about its drug pricing strategy and accounting practices. The heavy losses have weighed on hedge funds including William Ackman's Pershing Square and Nehal Chopra's Tiger Ratan, investors have said. Hedge funds' stock picks and what managers earn off their bets have been scrutinized for years, but they are receiving extra attention now that pension funds and other institutional investors are putting more money into hedge funds.Energy company Cheniere, which is among the top-10 holdings of 14 hedge funds and is 64 percent-owned by hedge funds, also dragged on returns, having dropped 29 percent this year. Traditionally, the Hedge Fund VIP list has outperformed the S&P 500, the Goldman data show, noting that the list beat the S&P 500 by 2.65 percentage points last year. In 2013 it beat the S&P 500 by 9 percentage points after beating it by 7 percentage points in 2012.When stocks tumbled in August amid concerns of slower growth in China and nervousness about when the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates, many fund managers adjusted their holdings, cutting health-care exposure and adding to technology holdings.""Hedge funds moved away from laggards to stronger performers,"" Goldman analysts wrote, noting that the VIP list now includes Chinese web services company Baidu Inc and online payments system company PayPal Holdings and no longer includes food company Kraft Heinz Co and Valeant.

672,"  (Adds details of initiative)SAN FRANCISCO/BENGALURU Dec 1 Facebook Inc  Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg and his wife said on Tuesday they will give away 99 percent of their Facebook shares, currently worth about $45 billion, to a new charity in a letter addressed to their daughter, Max, who was born last week.The plan mirrors a move by other high-profile billionaires like Warren Buffett and Bill and Melinda Gates, who have pledged and set up foundations to give away their fortunes to charity.On his Facebook page, Zuckerberg posted a photo of himself, his wife, Priscilla Chan and their new daughter, Max, along with a post entitled 'A letter to our daughter.' In the 2,220-word letter, Zuckerberg and Chan touched on issues including health, education, Internet access and learning before announcing the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, which aims to ""advance human potential and promote equality.""Zuckerberg, 31, and Chan said they plan to give away 99 percent of their Facebook shares over their lifetimes to advance the initiative, which was formed as a limited liability company controlled by the two. It will begin by focusing on personalized learning, curing disease, Internet connectivity and community building. Max Chan Zuckerberg was born early last week - though Facebook did not specify her birth date - and weighed 7 lbs 8 ounces at birth. Last month, Zuckerberg announced he would take two months of paternity leave after the birth of his daughter.Chan and Zuckerberg have so far committed $1.6 billion to their philanthropy. They have given several donations this year, including to public schools, initiatives to bring better wireless Internet access and to San Francisco General Hospital, where Chan works as a pediatrician. When Zuckerberg was 26, he signed the Giving Pledge, under which the world's wealthiest individuals and families commit to give more than half of their wealth to philanthropy or charitable causes over their lifetime or in their will.Zuckerberg said he still plans to remain CEO of Facebook for ""many, many years to come,"" and Facebook said Zuckerberg is expected to be the controlling stockholder of the company for the foreseeable future. He has committed to give away up to $1 billion of Facebook stock each year for the next three years, the company said.Zuckerberg and Chan said they will share more details when they return from their maternity and paternity leaves.

674,"   By Tim McLaughlin | BOSTON  BOSTON Will Danoff, one of the U.S. mutual fund industry's best stock pickers over the past 25 years, is tapping the brakes on funding so-called unicorn companies, saying the prospects for fast growing private businesses before they go public may be fading.Unicorns - start-ups valued at $1 billion or more - are making front-page news around the globe, and that makes Danoff nervous. He runs the $111 billion Contrafund FCNTX.O for Boston-based Fidelity Investments and his pre-IPO investments can lend an imprimatur of legitimacy, given his track record of picking blue-chip winners.""There are so many unicorns. It means you have to be more careful than we were three or four years ago,"" Danoff said in a telephone interview with Reuters. ""Maybe we are at a point where it's going to lose a bit of luster.""Danoff, 55, is not a household name and lacks the swagger of hedge fund managers such as Pershing Square's William Ackman or Third Point Capital's Daniel Loeb. But through Contrafund, a staple in U.S. 401(k) retirement plans, Danoff manages more money than those two combined. And over the past 15 years, Danoff has beaten the S&P 500 Index by 62 percent, with an annualized total return of 8.12 percent versus the benchmark's 5 percent, according to Morningstar Inc data.Danoff's Contrafund has about $1.4 billion invested in pre-IPO companies that include social media site Pinterest Inc ($457 million), office space business WeWork Companies Inc ($212 million), and car service Uber Technologies Inc ($193 million), for example. It's the single largest portfolio of pre-IPO companies in the U.S. mutual fund industry, according to industry fund disclosures. reut.rs/1lqcbox.>""You need to find franchise companies, almost up there with Google, Twitter and Facebook,"" Danoff said. ""These phenomena are cyclical. You have confidence early in the cycle, but you do investments with extreme caution later in the cycle. I'm much more careful with my recent moves in the private space."" Over the past three years, the valuations of private companies such as Uber, Xiaomi, Snapchat, Pinterest, Airbnb and Dropbox, for example, have skyrocketed, as they prepare to become publicly traded companies. Mutual funds such as Contrafund have become a bigger player in an investing sector once dominated by venture capital firms, boosting competition.HOT IPO  ""It's similar to a hot IPO,"" Danoff said, describing the competition for getting a piece of the action in the private rounds of funding for start-up companies.However, Danoff said he may only get one shot in investing in a unicorn before it goes public. ""It's little more difficult to pass up (than an IPO) because you're never sure if you get that second look,"" Danoff said. At least with an IPO, you can buy the stock later if the price drops. Danoff did that with Facebook Inc FB.O and now owns a stake worth about $5 billion.But in recent weeks, unicorn valuations have cooled off. Several funds run by Fidelity, including Contrafund, have cut the valuations of some big private companies, including Snapchat, Zenefits and Delphix Corp. Individual portfolio managers don't set valuations, which at Fidelity are done by a separate investment committee. Contrafund doesn't own Snapchat, which the committee devalued by 25 percent in October, but it does own Delphix, which the committee cut by 43 percent.Danoff said he feels good about the two dozen or so pre-IPO companies in his portfolio. But even two years ago, when Contrafund made a $159.4 million investment in Pinterest's Series E funding round, Danoff admits to balking at the price.""I was like, 'My gosh, that's a high valuation,'"" Danoff said. But since then, the value of that Series E stake in Pinterest has climbed nearly 150 percent, according to Contrafund disclosures. (Reporting by Tim McLaughlin.

675,"   By Mark Miller | CHICAGO  CHICAGO An open letter to Mark Zuckerberg:I hear that you plan to give away 99 percent of your Facebook shares - valued at $45 billion - for philanthropic purposes. What a great idea!Your timing makes sense - as a new parent, you naturally begin to think about legacy and the world in which your children will live.While you and your wife, Dr. Priscilla Chan, begin the search for ways to make an impact, here is a suggestion: rescue the future retirement security of every child in America with a ""Baby Roth"" account. The price-tag: $500 per child, with $500 extra each for low-income babies, which would add up to $38 billion over 10 years. The funds would go into a tax-advantaged savings account that could grow, with compounding, into sizeable nest eggs at retirement age, according to the founder of the idea, Ray Boshara, director of the Center for Household Financial Stability at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The idea has been proposed in legislation several times over the past decade to no avail. But all that is needed is a simple change to eligibility rules that require earned income for contributing to a Roth account - and the money.  It is a simple, brilliant idea that puts time on the side of our children. Boshara estimates that an initial contribution of $500 to an infant's account, with subsequent annual contributions of $250, would grow to $131,800 at age 65, compared with just $35,300 for an account started at age 25, assuming a 5 percent annual investment return (before fees).The hope is that the initial $500 would encourage parents to make later contributions, and then for each recipient to keep funding the accounts through their lives up to the standard Roth IRA limits.You would be tackling a problem that is accelerating. As it stands now, ownership of retirement accounts has fallen in recent years - just 40 percent of households owned any type of retirement account in 2013, down from 48 percent in 2007, according to Federal Reserve Board data. And 57 percent of workers have saved less than $25,000 for retirement, according to the Employee Benefit Research Institute. At the same time, valuable traditional defined benefit pensions have all but disappeared in the private sector. And Social Security is on track to replace less pre-retirement income in the decades ahead - the result of higher retirement ages legislated back in 1983 and expected higher health care costs, which will eat into net benefit amounts.Several large states are moving to create mandatory-participation workplace retirement plans for all workers not already covered by an employer 401(k). The federal government has rolled out the myRA, a no-fee simple starter account aimed at bringing more savers into the fold.And a bipartisan consensus on emphasizing retirement saving seems to be surfacing in Washington as part of a broader set of retirement security reforms.  Next month, for instance, a Bipartisan Policy Center task force will issue recommendations on retirement security and personal saving that is expected to include a mandatory national savings program, along with ideas for reform of Social Security and financial literacy initiatives.Mark, I understand that $38 billion might be more than you want to commit personally - and that would only cover the first 10 years! But I bet you could convince some of the other Silicon Valley tycoons who have been rushing to give away millions lately to chip in, too.Ideally, you would set this up as a starter investment, with taxpayers agreeing to start funding the program after it is off the ground.And who knows - your daughter Maxima might even benefit from a Baby Roth herself someday. She would be eligible to start drawdowns sometime in 2076.

687,"   By Sharon Bernstein | SACRAMENTO, Calif.  SACRAMENTO, Calif. Efforts to legalize marijuana in California got a boost this week after competing ballot measures joined forces behind the stronger of the two, backed by billionaire Sean Parker, a former president of Facebook Inc.The initiative has the support of Democratic Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom and the Coalition for Cannabis Policy Reform. Coalition board member Antonio Gonzalez, who is also president of the Latino Voters League, said the coalition withdrew its rival initiative after Parker's measure was modified to protect children, workers and small businesses. The move brings to a close weeks of behind-the-scenes negotiations aimed at closing the gaps between the initiatives, amid concerns that neither would succeed if both wound up on the ballot for 2016.    Marijuana use is illegal under federal law in the United States but 23 states allow the use of pot for medical purposes. Recently, Colorado, Washington and Oregon have approved recreational use and Alaska is set to allow it next year.Voters in Massachusetts, Michigan, Nevada and Arizona could face ballot initiatives next year intended to legalize marijuana. In California, amendments filed this week to Parker's proposal would allow local governments a greater say in where marijuana can be sold, toughen protections for children, including a ban on marketing to minors and explicit warning labels on marijuana products, and require safety standards and enforcement of labor laws for people who work in the industry.The measure would tax marijuana sales and cultivation, raising hundreds of millions of dollars for the state, proponents say. California has the largest marketplace for medical marijuana sales in the United States, according to the research group IBIS World. Nationwide, medical and recreational marijuana is expected to bring in $3.6 billion in revenue in 2015, growing to $13.4 billion over the next five years, the company says. A marijuana legalization initiative failed in California in 2010, but public opinion is shifting.Parker's measure would legalize recreational marijuana use for adults over 21 and set up a framework for regulating and taxing sales.Parker's deep pockets suggest that his initiative will be well-funded, although campaign finance records do not show any contributions as of Wednesday.  In 2010 supporters invested $3.5 million in Proposition 19, outspending opponents nearly 8-1. But the measure failed amid concerns that it did not protect children or guard against driving under the influence.California is home to ever-more expensive initiative campaigns. In 2012, supporters and opponents of Democratic Governor Jerry Brown's successful bid to temporarily raise taxes spent about $85 million, records show.

697,"   By Jeb Blount and Marcelo Teixeira | RIO DE JANEIRO/SAO PAULO  RIO DE JANEIRO/SAO PAULO A Brazilian judge on Thursday ordered the lifting of a 48-hour suspension of the services in Brazil of Facebook Inc's WhatsApp phone-messaging application, overturning an order from a lower court.The ban, which went into effect at midnight Wednesday, lasted about 12 hours until an appeals court judge overturned it.The interruption of WhatsApp's text message and Internet telephone service caused outrage in Latin America's largest country, where the company estimates it has 100 million personal users, and led to angry exchanges on the floor of Congress.WhatsApp is installed on 92.5 percent of Android devices in Brazil, making it the most installed app in the country, according to SimilarWeb, an internet intelligence and marketing company.Rival messaging system Telegram said on Twitter that it received 1 million downloads in Brazil in one day due to the outage. Telegram was installed on 2.35 percent of android devices before the blackout and Facebook Messenger on 74 percent, SimilarWeb said. A judge in Sao Bernardo do Campo, an industrial suburb of Sao Paulo, had ordered the suspension of WhatsApp's services from midnight on Wednesday (0200 GMT Thursday). The order was made after the California-based company, despite a fine, failed to comply with two judicial rulings to share information in a criminal case. ""Considering the constitutional principles, it does not look reasonable that millions of users be affected as a result of the company's inertia to provide information,"" Judge Xavier de Souza from the 11th criminal court of Sao Paulo said in the ruling, recommending a higher fine be imposed on WhatsApp.The incident highlighted growing international tensions between technology companies' privacy concerns and national authorities' efforts to use social media to recover information on possible criminal activities.""Until today, Brazil has been an ally in creating an open Internet,"" Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg posted after the interruption of WhatsApp's services. ""I am stunned that our efforts to protect people’s data would result in such an extreme decision by a single judge to punish every person in Brazil who uses WhatsApp.""According to Band News TV, the criminal case involves a drug trafficker linked to one of Sao Paulo's most dangerous criminal gangs, the PCC, or First Command of the Capital. The trafficker allegedly used WhatsApp services while committing crimes, and the court wants access to his communications with others. WhatsApp said it was unable, not unwilling, to comply.""We're disappointed that a judge would punish more than 100 million people across Brazil because we were unable to turn over information we didn’t have,"" a WhatsApp spokesperson said.     WhatsApp is used by individuals, companies and federal and local governments to send messages and share pictures and videos.  On the floor of Congress, lawmakers expressed their frustration at the suspension.  ""This is ridiculous,"" yelled congressman Caio Narcio. ""What about our freedom to communicate?""The suspension appeared to affect WhatsApp users outside Brazil's borders, as hundreds in Chile and Argentina took to social media on Thursday to complain that the messaging system was also interrupted in the two countries.Chilean telecom provider VTR, owned by Liberty Global Inc, said it had re-established service to WhatsApp for its clients by using an ""alternative international link."" Earlier it said that difficulty in accessing the app ""originated outside of Chile,"" without giving details.    (Additional reporting by Silvio Cascione in Brasilia, Marcelo Teixeira in Sao Paulo and Rosalba O'Brien in Santiago; Editing by Leslie Adler, Dominic Evans, Lisa Von Ahn and Leslie Adler)",2015-12-17,FB,"Thu Dec 17, 2015 | 4:12pm EST",Brazil court lifts suspension of Facebook's WhatsApp service,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-brazil-whatsapp-ban-idUSKBN0U000G20151217?type=companyNews

700,"  (Corrects name of Morgan Stanley Institutional Growth Portfolio in paragraph 3)By David RandallNEW YORK Dec 22 Top stock-picking fund managers won 2015 by aiming for brand name companies and avoiding the sector bets that brought down biotech and energy investors.Now, as they look ahead to 2016, these active investors expect to be even more defensive, picking companies like Hersheys Co and General Electric that they say will be able to weather the combination of slow global growth and the first U.S. interest rate hike in a nearly decade.""We're looking for companies that have some competitive advantage that makes them the standard in their industry,"" said Dennis Lynch, a co-portfolio manager of both the Morgan Stanley Institutional Advantage fund and the Morgan Stanley Institutional Growth Portfolio fund - the fifth and sixth best performing large cap funds of this year with returns of 11.5 percent through Monday's close.Lynch's Institutional Advantage fund, for instance, added positions in consumer companies including Hershey, Estee Lauder Companies Inc and Colgate-Palmolive Co in the quarter ending Sept. 30.These types of consumer companies with strong brands tend to withstand volatile markets, Lynch said. At the same time, he trimmed positions in top holdings Amazon.com Inc and Facebook Inc that rallied this year. Other active fund managers that are looking for big names with lots of downside protection in 2015 include Daniel Davidowitz, co-portfolio manager of the $804 million Polen Growth fund - the year's top performer in the large cap category - and Douglas Rao, portfolio manager of the $2.4 billion Janus Forty fund.""There's a lot of noise and volatility in the market right now, and we're in the position of trying to find companies that are less sensitive to the macro environment,"" said Rao.Rao's fund gained 10.7 percent for the year through Monday, a performance that was the 10th best among large-cap funds tracked by Lipper during a time when only 24 percent of large-cap funds have been able to outperform the 0.1 percent gain in the index this year, according to Lipper data.Much of Rao's performance came from his top holding, Google parent Alphabet Inc, which has gained 44 percent for the year to date, and Amazon, which more than doubled this year and accounts for his 8th-largest position. Yet Rao is not searching for the next stock to hit out the lights in 2016. Instead, he expects GE to once again outperform in the coming year as it sheds its GE Capital assets faster than analysts expect and turns more of its focus to segments such as expanding its line of industrial software.""The fact is that we have an opportunity to build a position in what we think will be a best of breed industrial company during a period where the U.S. is going through an industrial recession,"" he said. 'WHEN THE SEAS GET ROUGH' The Polen fund is aiming straight at all-weather stocks: All  20 companies in its portfolio generate high levels of cash flow, return 20 percent or more on capital and show increasing profit margins and organic revenue growth.Along with Facebook, Adobe was the only company Davidowitz added this year to his portfolio, which bested all large-cap funds tracked by Lipper with a gain of 13.4 percent through Monday. Much of that performance came from top holding Nike Inc, which has gained 36.4 percent for the year to date, along with large positions in Starbucks Corp - up 45.6 percent - and Visa Inc, up 17.7 percent.""We aren't built to try to take advantage of rate hikes or oil prices or anything like that,"" he said. ""We want companies like Adobe where it is hard for a competitor to pull their customers away.""That approach may be especially important in the year to come. Since 1945, the benchmark S&P 500 has gained an average of 4.5 percent over the 12 months following the first rate hike of a business cycle, or about half of the 8.8 percent average gain for the index among all years, according to data from S&P Capital IQ.""There's an old saying that when seas get rough sailors prefer a larger boat, and we may have investors gravitating toward larger-cap companies because they expect even rougher seas ahead,"" said Sam Stovall, chief equity strategist at S&P Capital IQ.

But in a 4-0 decision, the appeals court noted that the law firms had found experts to counter Facebook's forgery claim, and that Ceglia had passed a lie detector test.The court called Facebook's allegation that the firms lacked probable cause to pursue Ceglia's case ""entirely conclusory.""Facebook said it is evaluating whether to appeal. ""We are disappointed,"" a spokeswoman said. ""DLA Piper and the other named law firms possessed evidence proving the case was based on forged documents and that Paul Ceglia's claim was a fraud, but chose to pursue it anyway. We believe they should be held accountable.""Matthew Dontzin, a lawyer representing DLA Piper, said Facebook and Zuckerberg sued solely ""to deter lawyers from taking them on. These types of bullying tactics have no place in the courthouse and today justice was done.""Sigmund Wissner-Gross, a lawyer representing Lippes Mathias, said he was pleased with the decision. Milberg's lawyer Gregory Joseph declined to comment.The Facebook spokeswoman said the Menlo Park, California-based company will continue litigation against Paul Argentieri, another of Ceglia's lawyers.

709,"   By Jonathan Stempel | NEW YORK  NEW YORK A federal judge has certified two shareholder class actions accusing Facebook Inc of hiding concerns about its growth forecasts prior to the social media company's May 2012 initial public offering.U.S. District Judge Robert Sweet in Manhattan said retail and institutional investors who claimed to lose money from buying Facebook shares at inflated prices in connection with the $16 billion IPO may pursue their respective claims as groups.The decision is dated Dec. 11 but had been kept under seal, which Sweet lifted in an order made public on Tuesday.Other Facebook defendants include Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg, Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg and other officials. Facebook is appealing the class certifications, which the Menlo Park, California-based company said are ""without merit"" and conflict with ""well-settled"" precedent. Shareholders accused Facebook of concealing internal projections prior to its IPO of how growth in mobile devices, an area in which it generated little ad revenue, might hurt its prospects, even as it quietly warned underwriters to cut their forecasts.Facebook made its market debut on May 18, 2012 at $38 per share. Its share price fell to $17.55 on Sept. 4, 2012 and stayed below the IPO price for more than a year.The stock ultimately rebounded, and closed on Tuesday up $1.33 at $107.26 on Nasdaq. That gave Facebook a roughly $303 billion market value, Reuters data show. In his 55-page decision, Sweet said Facebook ""marshaled an impressive amount of evidence"" to suggest that shareholders knew how mobile usage would affect revenue.But he rejected Facebook's argument that shareholders should pursue their claims individually, which might prove costly and reduce recoveries, because of wide variations in how much they knew.Sweet wrote that ""given the extraordinary size of this case,"" allowing two subclasses ""in fact adds more weight to the predominance of common questions and answers, practically negating the individualized questions raised."" In asking the federal appeals court in Manhattan for permission to appeal the class certifications, Facebook said on Monday ""the suggestion that class members' knowledge might be inferred on a class-wide basis flouts due process,"" helping make Sweet's decision ""all the more arbitrary.""The law firms Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossmann and Labaton Sucharow were appointed class counsel.

710,"   By David Randall | NEW YORK  NEW YORK The year's top-performing U.S.-listed global equities fund as rated by Morningstar sees Asian and emerging market stocks as undervalued and primed to outperform in 2016.Kristian Heugh, whose $641 million Morgan Stanley Global Opportunity fund gained 20 percent for the year through Dec. 29, said his fund has been adding positions in South Korean companies such as Hotel Shilla Co Ltd and database company NAVER Corp that have attractive valuations, while trimming some positions in technology companies that have rallied this year. ""With the U.S. and developed markets in general outperforming over recent years, it makes sense that some of the other markets might represent better value now,"" he said.  The move is a slight shift for Heugh, whose strong performance in 2015 was largely due to his position in U.S. companies. His three largest holdings this year - Facebook Inc, software company EPAM Systems Inc, and Amazon.com Inc - rose at least 37 percent over the year to date. His largest non-U.S.-based stock, Danish transport logistics company DSV A/S, gained 45 percent for the year to date. Overall, Heugh, who is based in Hong Kong, has approximately 48 percent of his portfolio in U.S. stocks, 40 percent in international stocks, and 10 percent in cash. He is looking for companies with ""strong barriers to entry"" and high levels of cash, he said.  Heugh tends to own more companies in the technology and consumer discretionary sectors because they often have higher returns on invested capital and lower leverage, while shying away from higher-levered financials and materials companies, he said. Over the last five years, Heugh's fund has gained an average 13.8 percent a year, a performance that puts it among the top 1 percent of the 773 U.S.-listed global stock funds tracked by Morningstar.

His three largest holdings this year - Facebook Inc , software company EPAM Systems Inc, and Amazon.com Inc - rose at least 37 percent over the year to date. His largest non-U.S.-based stock, Danish transport logistics company DSV A/S, gained 45 percent for the year to date.Overall, Heugh, who is based in Hong Kong, has approximately 48 percent of his portfolio in U.S. stocks, 40 percent in international stocks, and 10 percent in cash. He is looking for companies with ""strong barriers to entry"" and high levels of cash flow, he said. Heugh tends to own more companies in the technology and consumer discretionary sectors because they often have higher returns on invested capital and lower leverage, while shying away from higher-levered financials and materials companies, he said.Over the last five years, Heugh's fund has gained an average 13.8 percent a year, a performance that puts it among the top 1 percent of the 773 U.S.-listed global stock funds tracked by Morningstar.

723,"  * Brokers offering trading accounts using messaging apps* Some institutions also give trade instructions using apps* Regulators clamping down on trading compliance breaches* Regulations require reliable monitoring, recording of tradesBy Engen Tham and Suzanne BarlynSHANGHAI/NEW YORK, Jan 6 A growing number of China's retail investors are opening trading accounts on messaging and social media app WeChat, and some institutional investors are even using it to instruct brokers, making it harder for regulators to monitor trades and spot illegal activity, traders and investors told Reuters.While using mobile messaging and social media apps for trading is not unlawful in China, regulations require reliable monitoring and recording of trades to prevent activities such as insider trading or market manipulation, and to keep on top of threats to market stability such as excessive margin trading.China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) has been clamping down on breaches, including fining four brokerages in September for failing to collect information about the identities of clients who traded stocks through external systems.It also shut down third-party trading software used by brokers that helped traders skirt regulations by dividing one account into many sub-accounts without the need to register a name, according to local media.Even so, using apps to buy and sell stocks over mobile phones is common in a country where retail investors account for 80 percent of share market volume. Despite closer scrutiny from China's regulators, brokerages including large listed firms like China Galaxy Securities  and smaller entities such as Great Wall Securities, started offering WeChat share trading account services last year in a bid to access the growing pool of retail traders.China Galaxy Securities and Great Wall Securities did not return requests for comment.Overall account openings swelled to around 46 million in the first half of 2015, from around 2 million over the same period in 2014, according to official data.For brokers, the advantages of using WeChat are obvious, since it is the preferred means of communication for many of its 600 million users.But a case in Hong Kong last month highlights regulators' concerns with the trend. The regulator there suspended a trader for receiving a buy order on WhatsApp, a messaging app owned by Facebook Inc, in breach of the internal communication policies of the firm he then worked for, BTIG, noting that the company had no control over the recording and retention of such messages.GROWING RISKS While the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission code of conduct does not prohibit the use of social messaging apps, it encourages the strict recording and time stamping of all communications and says the use of mobile phones for orders is ""strongly discouraged"". Some of China's institutional investors are also using WeChat to instruct their brokers.""In practice lots of people don't care about compliance and take orders on WeChat,"" said a Hong Kong-based institutional sales trader specialising in China.The CSRC did not respond to requests for comment, nor did Tencent Holdings Ltd, the owner of WeChat.Such concerns are not limited to China.Clara Shih, chief executive and founder of Hearsay Social, Inc, a San Francisco-based social media compliance company, said messaging apps are also a potential gap in the compliance systems that U.S. financial services firms have spent years building.U.S. brokerages must monitor and store copies of employees' electronic communications for three years and have a duty to protect clients' personal information and confidentiality, tasks made more complicated by the proliferation of social media platforms.Technology has evolved in recent years to make it easier for companies to monitor employees' activity on traditional social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter. But WhatsApp and WeChat are not compatible with that technology, Shih said.Using social media for business is a growing trend but also a growing risk for compliance, said Craig Brauff, chief executive of Erado, a social media compliance company in Renton, Washington.""Regulations are designed to keep honest people honest.

727,"   By Ross Kerber  Media company Viacom Inc will allow investors to vote in March on whether to extend voting rights to all shareholders, according to documents provided to Reuters, as concern grows over the health of the company's 92-year-old executive chairman Sumner Redstone.The measure is certain to fail because Redstone's holding company with a supermajority stake opposes it, but the vote will test investor sentiment on Redstone's continued stewardship.The plan and Viacom's agreement to put it to a vote at its annual meeting in March were provided to Reuters on Thursday by the activist who submitted it.Seamus Finn, director of socially responsible investing for Missionary Oblates, a Roman Catholic congregation in Washington, D.C., said he understands the proposal has little chance of passage, given the questions around Redstone's condition, but it is important to air out the issue in the public setting of a shareholders meeting.Considering that Viacom is a media company, ""it's particularly important that there be a greater level of democracy and a greater level of transparency and participation by the shareholders,"" Finn said.As for Redstone's health, ""It's something to be taken into consideration,"" Finn said. A Viacom spokesman confirmed the company's plans to hold the vote on the shareholder proposal and reiterated the company's argument that its dual-class share structure helps it focus on long-term goals.""We will include this proposal in our proxy statement as required by SEC rules, just as many other companies have done with similar proposals,"" said Viacom spokesman Jeremy Zweig.Redstone controls about 80 percent of Viacom's Class A voting shares through his holding company, National Amusements  Inc. Most outsiders hold Viacom's Class B shares, which do not have voting rights. Finn, a well-known shareholder activist, and reform-minded allies have long argued against dual shareholder classes. Last month, leaders of major public pension funds in California and Florida called on Viacom to make a similar change.Questions about Redstone's health have been growing for months, and were heightened in November after a former girlfriend raised doubts in a lawsuit about the billionaire's competence.On Dec. 21, a California judge granted the former girlfriend's request to depose Viacom Chief Executive Officer Philippe Dauman and two of Redstone's doctors, but not Redstone himself. Redstone also controls CBS Corp. Viacom's shares have been under pressure, down 45 percent over the past year, as the company, which operates the Nickelodeon and MTV cable channels, faces slipping ratings and more consumers ditching pricey cable television subscriptions.Technically Finn's group, which owns 4,000 voting shares of Viacom's Class A stock, asked Viacom to include on the ballot for its annual meeting a resolution calling on its board to ""take steps to adopt a recapitalization plan as soon as practicable for all outstanding stock to have one-vote per share,"" according to the proposal.The change could include negotiating with Redstone family shareholders to give up pre-existing rights, it states.In a letter dated Dec. 22, 2015, and supplied by Finn, Viacom Vice President Heidi Naunton wrote to Finn that the company plans to include the proposal in its proxy statement for its annual meeting, and that it opposes the proposal.The Viacom letter also explains its opposition, saying its dual-class structure ""has helped protect our company from short-term pressures and the disruption associated with efforts by activists to challenge control, and the structure has thereby allowed our board and senior management to focus on our long-term success.""Viacom also noted other big public companies have adopted the dual-class structure, including Facebook Inc and Alphabet Inc, the holding company for Google.",2016-01-08,FB,"Fri Jan 8, 2016 | 12:17pm EST",Viacom to allow vote on expanding shareholder rights,http://www.reuters.com//article/viacom-votingrights-idUSL1N14S1DL20160108?type=companyNews

It has already introduced full encryption for users on Android phones.

""Twitter inside a larger organization definitely makes theoretical sense, whether its another internet company or a media company,"" Monness, Crespi, Hardt, & Co Inc analyst James Cakmak said.A News Corp spokesman said there was no truth to the rumors.Twitter already has several high-profile investors. Former Microsoft Corp CEO Steve Ballmer reported a 4 percent stake in October, making him the third-biggest shareholder after Twitter co-founder Evan Williams and Saudi billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal. Twitter has been the subject of takeover rumors in the past, including a fake report attributed to Bloomberg that claimed the company had received an offer to be acquired for $31 billion. (reut.rs/1Qn5AIj)Twitter had received bids from Alphabet Inc's Google and Facebook Inc, according to reports. Twitter trades at 28.12 times forward earnings, below its peer median of 36.06. Facebook has a PE of 33.08, while LinkedIn Corp's is 52.64, according to Thomson Reuters data.""Even though News Corp denied the rumors, I do think this could help investors potentially see some valuations for the stock,"" Cakmak added. Up to Tuesday's close, the stock had fallen nearly 41 percent since Dorsey was named permanent CEO in October.

The S&P energy sector rallied 2.6 percent, buoyed by a rise of almost 3 percent in oil prices due to speculation that Saudi Arabia and other OPEC countries would cut output to boost prices.Optimism sparked by earnings from Facebook and a handful of other companies, as well as the bounce in oil prices, was behind most of the day's improved sentiment, investors said.But they also warned the gains could be short-lived and that a steep selloff this year caused by weak oil and worries about China's economy may not be exhausted.""The market was overdue for a bounce.

""It's phenomenal at these (currency headwind) levels that they're accelerating to that level of growth,"" said Rob Sanderson, an analyst at MKM Partners.Facebook's dominance in mobile advertising helped to allay Wall Street concerns over its heavy investments in messaging service WhatsApp and virtual reality unit Oculus, which have not yet generated profits.""I don't think there's going to be too many people crying for them to start monetizing other properties anytime soon because the core business is so strong,"" said Sanderson.Facebook shares rose almost 12 percent in after-hours trading to $105.32.They were helped by Chief Financial Officer David Wehner's comment on a call with analysts that he expected operating expenses to increase by 30 to 40 percent over the course of the year, a slower clip than last year. Total revenue rose to $5.84 billion from $3.85 billion a year earlier, with ad revenue increasing 56.8 percent to $5.64 billion in the holiday shopping period, when spending on advertising typically spikes. Excluding some items, the company earned 79 cents per share.   Analysts on average had expected earnings of 68 cents per share and revenue of $5.37 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Apart from focussing on mobile, Facebook has been ramping up spending on what it calls ""big bets,"" including virtual reality, artificial intelligence and drones to connect the remotest parts of the world to the Internet.Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg, who returned from two months of paternity leave on Monday, has said virtual reality represents the next major computing platform.In January, Facebook began taking orders for a consumer version of the Oculus Rift, a head-mounted virtual reality unit. The company has also begun monetizing some of its other units, such as photo-sharing app Instagram, which surpassed 400 million users last year and began selling ads in September.Facebook said mobile ads accounted for 80 percent of total ad revenue in the quarter, compared with about 78 percent in the third quarter and 69 percent a year earlier.""It's much stronger ad growth than we were expecting,"" said Ken Sena, an analyst at Evercore ISI.Facebook's service is not available for users in China but it can sell ads to companies there.  ""It signifies the importance of what they're providing to advertisers,"" he said. ""They're making big investments and evidenced by their quarterly performance it seems to be working.""The company, which has the world's most popular smartphone app, has also been benefiting from a surge in video views that has attracted advertising dollars. Facebook said it had 1.59 billion monthly active users as of Dec. 31, up 14 percent from the end of 2014. Of those, 1.44 billion used the service on mobile devices, an increase of 21 percent.

It was launched in China in September.Virtual reality (VR) is seen as the next big thing in technology but not many devices are available for sale in India.Oculus, the VR company Facebook Inc bought in 2014, started accepting pre-orders this month for its much-awaited headset, Rift, which is priced at $599.Atul Jain, India chief operating officer of LeEco, declined to disclose the price of the company's VR device.LeEco, formerly known as LeTV, entered India earlier this month with the launch of two smartphones - Le 1s, priced at  10,999 rupees ($162), and Le Max, priced at 32,999 rupees. The company, which got more than 300,000 registrations for a flash sale of the phones scheduled for Feb. 2 on e-commerce website Flipkart [IPO-FLPK.N], said it doesn't expect any supply glitches even if all those registrants convert into customers.""I'm actually expecting a much bigger (registration) number by the time the flash sales begin,"" Jain said.The company's China-based rivals, OnePlus and Xiaomi, had faced problems as demand outstripped supply, leading to a delay in deliveries. LeEco sells roughly half a million smartphones in China every month, Jain said. ""There is a huge amount of production capacity available.""Founded in 2004, LeEco started selling smartphones in China in April last year and has sold 4 million of them so far, said Jain, who earlier worked at Samsung Electronics.LeEco also plans to gradually bring all its products, including Netflix-like streaming service and electric cars, to India. The company has already tied up with ErosNow and YuppTV for providing online content and is in talks with others companies for possible partnerships.Jain declined to comment on any partnership talks with RelianceJio, telecom arm of Reliance Industries Ltd, which is building India's biggest 4G telecommunications network.($1 = 68.0673 Indian rupees) (Reporting by Supantha Mukherjee and Sai R Sachin in Bengaluru; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty)",2016-01-28,FB,"Thu Jan 28, 2016 | 2:10pm EST",LeEco plans to start selling VR headsets in India,http://www.reuters.com//article/leeco-vr-idUSKCN0V62LG?type=companyNews
755,"   By Yasmeen Abutaleb and Abhirup Roy  Facebook Inc (FB.O) smashed investors' expectations with a 52-percent jump in quarterly revenue as it sold more ads targeted at a fast-growing number of mobile users, sending its shares sharply higher after hours.The world's biggest online social network bucked the trend of underwhelming tech results from Apple Inc and eBay Inc, in the face of economic uncertainty around the world and a strong U.S. dollar depressing the value of overseas sales. ""It's phenomenal at these (currency headwind) levels that they're accelerating to that level of growth,"" said Rob Sanderson, an analyst at MKM Partners.Facebook's dominance in mobile advertising helped to allay Wall Street concerns over its heavy investments in messaging service WhatsApp and virtual reality unit Oculus, which have not yet generated profits.""I don't think there's going to be too many people crying for them to start monetizing other properties anytime soon because the core business is so strong,"" said Sanderson.Facebook shares rose almost 12 percent in after-hours trading to $105.32.They were helped by Chief Financial Officer David Wehner's comment on a call with analysts that he expected operating expenses to increase by 30 to 40 percent over the course of the year, a slower clip than last year. Total revenue rose to $5.84 billion from $3.85 billion a year earlier, with ad revenue increasing 56.8 percent to $5.64 billion in the holiday shopping period, when spending on advertising typically spikes. Excluding some items, the company earned 79 cents per share.   Analysts on average had expected earnings of 68 cents per share and revenue of $5.37 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Apart from focussing on mobile, Facebook has been ramping up spending on what it calls ""big bets,"" including virtual reality, artificial intelligence and drones to connect the remotest parts of the world to the Internet.Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg, who returned from two months of paternity leave on Monday, has said virtual reality represents the next major computing platform.In January, Facebook began taking orders for a consumer version of the Oculus Rift, a head-mounted virtual reality unit. The company has also begun monetizing some of its other units, such as photo-sharing app Instagram, which surpassed 400 million users last year and began selling ads in September.Facebook said mobile ads accounted for 80 percent of total ad revenue in the quarter, compared with about 78 percent in the third quarter and 69 percent a year earlier.""It's much stronger ad growth than we were expecting,"" said Ken Sena, an analyst at Evercore ISI.Facebook's service is not available for users in China but it can sell ads to companies there.  ""It signifies the importance of what they're providing to advertisers,"" he said. ""They're making big investments and evidenced by their quarterly performance it seems to be working.""The company, which has the world's most popular smartphone app, has also been benefiting from a surge in video views that has attracted advertising dollars. Facebook said it had 1.59 billion monthly active users as of Dec. 31, up 14 percent from the end of 2014. Of those, 1.44 billion used the service on mobile devices, an increase of 21 percent. Analysts had expected the company to report 1.58 billion monthly active users, with 1.43 billion accessing the service through smartphones and tablets, according to market research firm FactSet StreetAccount.Up to Wednesday's close at $94.45, Facebook's stock had risen nearly 25 percent in the past 12 months.

756,"   By Dustin Volz | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Facebook Inc (FB.O) prohibited global users from coordinating person-to-person private sales of firearms on its online social network and its Instagram photo-sharing service on Friday, countering concerns that it was increasingly being used to circumvent background checks on gun purchases.The move comes as the United States debates the issue of  access to guns after a string of mass shootings. U.S. President Barack Obama has urged social media companies to clamp down on gun sales organized on their platforms.It updates Facebook's regulated goods policy, introduced in March 2014, that banned people from selling marijuana, pharmaceuticals and illegal drugs.Facebook already prohibited private firearms sellers from advertising ""no background check required,"" or offering transactions across U.S. state lines without a licensed dealer because the company said such posts indicated a willingness to evade the law. Licensed retailers will still be able to advertise firearms on Facebook that lead to transactions outside of Facebook's service, the spokeswoman said.""Over the last two years, more and more people have been using Facebook to discover products and to buy and sell things to one another,"" Monika Bickert, Facebook's head of product policy, said in a statement. ""We are continuing to develop, test, and launch new products to make this experience even better for people and are updating our regulated goods policies to reflect this evolution,"" Bickert said. Facebook is the world's most popular online social network, with 1.59 billion users across the globe, 219 million of them in the United States and Canada.The National Rifle Association, a lobbying group opposed to limits on U.S. gun ownership rights, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Groups advocating increased gun control applauded the new policy.""Moms are grateful for the leadership shown by Facebook today,"" said Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, a part of the Everytown for Gun Safety campaign group.

Currently, Twitter (TWTR.N) arranges tweets in chronological order.The response to the news on Twitter was overwhelmingly negative, with the hashtag #RIPTwitter suggesting many users of the micro-blogging site believe the changes would mean the death of the company.Many users were upset that tweets from accounts with fewer followers could possibly be suppressed under the new system. Others complained that the changes would make Twitter too much like Facebook (FB.O), which arranges content through the use of an algorithm. “Dear Twitter, don’t try to be like Facebook, we don’t like Facebook #RIPTwitter,” tweeted ana (@dearcalumthood) on Saturday.“Clearly the motto 'if it ain't broke don't fix it' is something @twitter isn't familiar with #RIPTwitter,” tweeted EldestSalvatore (@EldestDamon) on Saturday. A spokesperson for Twitter declined to comment.Twitter has come under increasing pressure to boost user growth, as it struggles to attain advertising revenues equaling those of its larger Facebook rival. Last month, Twitter came under fire when it announced a new feature that would allow users to post tweets up to 10,000 characters long, up from its previous limit of 140 characters.

Critics and Internet activists argue that allowing access to a select few apps and Web services for free would put small content providers and start-ups that don't participate at a disadvantage. On his Facebook page, Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg wrote, ""Connecting India is an important goal we won't give up on, because more than a billion people in India don't have access to the internet. We know that connecting them can help lift people out of poverty, create millions of jobs and spread education opportunities.""On Monday, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI), which had suspended the free Facebook service pending a policy decision, said Internet service providers would not be allowed to discriminate on pricing for different Web services. ""Essentially everything on the Internet is agnostic in the sense that it cannot be priced differently,"" TRAI Chairman Ram Sevak Sharma said at a news conference.Although the new rules will also have implications for plans by Indian telecom operators to make money from rapidly surging Web traffic through differential pricing, Facebook's campaign turned the spotlight on the social networking giant.Free Basics is part of Facebook's ambition to expand in its largest market outside the United States. Only 252 million out of India's 1.3 billion people have Internet access. ""We are delighted by the regulator's recognition of the irreversible damage that stands to be done to the open Internet by allowing differential pricing,"" said Mishi Choudhary, a New York-based lawyer who led an online campaign against Facebook.Facebook shares closed down 4.2 percent at $99.75 on the Nasdaq amid broad weakness in U.S. markets.

As a result, fund managers are picking up individual companies that have been on their watch lists, rather than broadly buying. Colin Morton, a portfolio manager at Franklin Templeton, said his fund has added 4 new positions in the last two weeks after largely not buying last year.

""Only a few months ago these companies were trading on valuations that were too high, but now we're seeing share prices down 30 to 50 percent,"" Morton said.  Amazon.com Inc, Netflix Inc, and Google-parent Alphabet Inc carried the overall S&P 500 last year, yet did so largely by catapulting to valuations that left many fund managers too skittish to buy.

782,"   By Yasmeen Abutaleb | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Five months ago, Facebook Inc (FB.O) began trying to transform its picture-sharing app, Instagram, into a money-making business. Since then, Instagram has attracted more than 200,000 advertisers, the company announced Wednesday, a clear sign of its potential for significantly contributing to Facebook’s revenue.Instagram opened its platform to a couple of hundred advertisers in June, the company said, and by September had opened the app to anyone wanting to purchase an ad. Three-quarters of its advertisers are now outside of the United States, the company said.Instagram has also rapidly grown its user base, surpassing 400 million users last year. By comparison, Twitter (TWTR.N), which began selling advertisements more than five years ago, has 130,000 advertisers and 320 million users.Instagram has had distinct advantages: It uses Facebook’s ad technology, which is among the most advanced and allows advertisers to target highly specific demographic groups, such as 18-25 year old males who live in New York. And advertisers have the option to run campaigns across both Facebook and Instagram. “The Facebook relationship has helped us grow our user base” and attract advertisers, said James Quarles, Instagram’s head of global advertising. “People can be creative in using the two together and run things across both platforms.

783,"   By Yasmeen Abutaleb | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Five months ago, Facebook Inc (FB.O) began trying to transform its picture-sharing app, Instagram, into a money-making business. Since then, Instagram has attracted more than 200,000 advertisers, the company announced Wednesday, a clear sign of its potential for significantly contributing to Facebook’s revenue.Instagram opened its platform to a couple of hundred advertisers in June, the company said, and by September had opened the app to anyone wanting to purchase an ad. Three-quarters of its advertisers are now outside of the United States, the company said.Instagram has also rapidly grown its user base, surpassing 400 million users last year. By comparison, Twitter (TWTR.N), which began selling advertisements more than five years ago, has 130,000 advertisers and 320 million users.Instagram has had distinct advantages: It uses Facebook’s ad technology, which is among the most advanced and allows advertisers to target highly specific demographic groups, such as 18-25 year old males who live in New York. And advertisers have the option to run campaigns across both Facebook and Instagram. “The Facebook relationship has helped us grow our user base” and attract advertisers, said James Quarles, Instagram’s head of global advertising. “People can be creative in using the two together and run things across both platforms. That really hasn’t existed much in the marketing world.” Instagram would not disclose how many of its advertisers also use Facebook, but during an earnings call last month, Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg said 98 of Facebook’s top 100 advertisers also ran ads on Instagram.

786,"   By Yasmeen Abutaleb and Arathy S Nair | WASHINGTON/BENGALURU  WASHINGTON/BENGALURU Facebook users around the globe can now do more than ""like"" a post. They can love it, laugh at it or feel angered by it.The social network rolled out ""Reactions"" - an extension of the ""Like"" button - worldwide on Wednesday, to allow users to express sadness, wow, anger, love and laughter.In a video accompanying a blog post, the five new buttons appear as animated emoticons that pop up when the ""Like"" button is held down on mobile devices. The buttons appear on desktops when users hover over the ""Like"" button.Facebook launched a pilot of ""Reactions"" - which allowed users to select from seven emotions including ""Angry"", ""Sad"", ""Wow"" and ""Like"" - in Ireland and Spain in October.The ""Yay"" emoticon, which was present in the pilot launch (on.fb.me/1LBnXIG), was not seen in Wednesday's video (bit.ly/24oZ6yi). ""People wanted to express empathy and make it comfortable to share a wider range of emotions,"" Zuckerberg wrote on his Facebook page.    Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said in September the company was thinking of adding a ""dislike"" button, which spearheaded a debate over whether it would increase cyber bullying and negativity on the site. In October, the company said it would expand its signature ""Like"" button with various reactions. The slow test and rollout of the expanded button - which Zuckerberg has said is the company's biggest design change to date - is a marked change from Zuckerberg's famous mantra, ""move fast and break things.""  The company said it will also use ""Reactions"" to track user behavior and for ad delivery.""We will initially use any Reaction similar to a Like to infer that you want to see more of that type of content,"" Facebook said in a separate blog post.(bit.ly/1TFzfOC)The feature received mixed reviews from users on social networking sites. Many complained that they could not see the new emoticons, while some were unhappy that Facebook did not launch a ""dislike"" button.Marina Cupo wrote on Facebook: ""I would rather have had a DISLIKE button and then attach an emotion instead if I want!""Users have often responded negatively to similar changes on other sites. Twitter, for example, replaced its star-shaped ""favorite"" icon with a heart-shaped icon called ""like"" in November. Users initially scorned the change, but Twitter later said it increased activity on the site.

789,"   By Brad Haynes | SAO PAULO  SAO PAULO Brazilian police arrested a senior Facebook Inc executive on Tuesday as a dispute escalated over a court's demand that the company provide data from its WhatsApp messaging service to help in a secretive drug-trafficking investigation.  Court officials in Sergipe state confirmed that a judge had ordered the jailing of Facebook Vice President for Latin America Diego Dzodan. Federal police in Sao Paulo state said he was being held there for questioning.  Law enforcement officials withheld further information about the nature of their request to the messaging service that Facebook Inc acquired in 2014, saying that doing so could compromise an ongoing criminal investigation.  The arrest, which Facebook called an ""extreme and disproportionate measure,"" came as social media and Internet companies face mounting pressure from governments around the world to help them eavesdrop on users and filter content.Arrests of officials from social media companies are extremely rare, though not unprecedented, because the companies typically comply with local court orders, especially from countries where they have branch offices.  ""Precisely because these large global Internet companies have staff in many countries who are vulnerable to legal action including arrest and criminal charges, they generally do comply with legally binding requests from authorities for user data or to remove or block content in those countries where they have 'boots on the ground,'"" said Internet freedom activist Rebecca MacKinnon.  Prior to its acquisition by Facebook, California-based WhatsApp had less skin in the game in disputes with governments outside the United States because, unlike Facebook, it did not have staff scattered around the globe. ""WhatsApp is a company that was started very focused on U.S. laws,"" said Internet law attorney Marcia Hoffmann. ""Now that it's owned by a company with people and resources in other countries, there is more leverage for those governments to put pressure in new and in different ways. Arresting executives is one of them.""   While details of the case remain murky, court officials said the judge in Brazil resorted to the arrest after issuing a fine of 1 million reais ($250,000) to compel Facebook to help investigators access WhatsApp messages relevant to their drug-trafficking investigation. That is likely impossible because WhatsApp began using end-to-end encryption technology in 2014 that prevents the company from monitoring messages that travel across its network, said Christopher Soghoian, principal technologist with the American Civil Liberties Union. ""They are using technology to try to take themselves out of the surveillance business,"" Soghoian said. The arrest surfaced as Apple Inc finds itself at odds with the United States government on similar grounds. U.S. prosecutors want the company to build a software tool to help investigators unlock the iPhone used by one of the shooters in the San Bernardino, California, attacks. Apple has refused, saying it would set a dangerous precedent that would make its customers vulnerable to spying.

793,"   By Eric Auchard | FRANKFURT  FRANKFURT Germany's cartel office is investigating Facebook (FB.O) for suspected abuse of market power over breaches of data protection laws in the first formal probe of the social network for violating competition rules.The watchdog said it suspected Facebook's terms of service regarding how the company makes use of users' data may abuse its possibly dominant position in the social networking market. It planned to examine whether users were properly informed about how their personal data would be obtained by the company.Facebook, the world's biggest social network with 1.6 billion monthly users, earns revenues from advertising based on data it gathers about its users' social connections, opinions and activities in their postings.""For advertising-financed Internet services such as Facebook, user data are hugely important,"" Federal Cartel Office President Andreas Mundt said. ""For this reason it is essential to also examine under the aspect of abuse of market power whether the consumers are sufficiently informed about the type and extent of data collected.""A Facebook spokeswoman said on Wednesday: ""We are confident that we comply with the law and we look forward to working with the Federal Cartel Office to answer their questions.""The company has faced criticism from politicians and regulators in Germany, where data protection is strictly regulated, over its privacy practices and its slow response to anti-immigrant postings by neo-Nazi sympathizers.  Co-founder and Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg visited Berlin on a charm offensive last week. ""We welcome the approach of the Cartel office,"" Hamburg Data Protection Commissioner Johannes Caspar told Reuters. ""Whoever has power over user data gets market power and vice versa.""EU officials have also expressed support for the view that Facebook's use of data might expose it to regulatory action on competition grounds.  The cartel office said it was coordinating its probe with the European Commission, competition authorities in other European Union states, data protection authorities in Germany and consumer rights groups.French and Irish competition regulators said they were not actively involved with the German case. A spokesman for the Belgian competition authority declined to comment on whether it was cooperating with the German probe, while the British regulator was not immediately reachable.""This is an unusual case in many respects,"" said Mark Watts, head of data protection at London-based law firm Bristows.He said it was the first time the volume of personal data a company held was such a significant factor in an investigation into whether a company has abused its dominant position.Facebook owns four of the top eight social network services globally including its core profile service, two separate instant messaging services, WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger, and its photo and video-sharing social network service Instagram. Facebook has nearly the twice the number of users as the world's second largest social network, Tencent's (0700.HK) QQ of China. Nearly 84 percent of the members of Facebook's core social network are outside the United States and Canada, which generated half its nearly $18 billion in revenues last year.Companies can theoretically face a fine of up to 10 percent of their annual turnover by the German competition regulator if they are found to have abused a dominant market position. But the cartel office has never leveled a maximum penalty. BIG DATA European regulators have begun debating the role that vast collections of ""big data"" - collected from billions of Web searches, messages and other online interactions - give Internet giants in marketing and commerce and how such data makes it difficult for smaller businesses to compete in those areas. ""User data is often the currency which consumers pay for supposedly free services,"" said Klaus Mueller, chairman of the Federation of German Consumer Organizations. ""Consumers have no adequate alternative. They can't just transfer their user data to other portals.""The cartel office had already signaled last month it was ready to consider data protection issues as raising potential competition concerns.European Commission spokesman Ricardo Cardoso said the EU executive shared the view of the German cartel office that the mere infringement of data protection rules by a dominant company did not automatically amount to a competition violation.""However, it cannot be excluded that a behavior that violates data protection rules could also be relevant when investigating a possible violation of EU competition rules,"" he added, while declining specific comment on the new case.Speaking in Germany in January, top EU antitrust enforcer Margrethe Vestager said her agency was taking a harder look at whether the collection of vast amounts of consumer data by big Internet companies violates competition rules.By contrast, U.S. privacy law enforcement remains limited to gross privacy violations where it can be show companies failed to properly safeguard customer information.The EU has accused Facebook rival Google, a unit of Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), of favoring its own shopping services in search results at the expense of rivals, and is weighing possible sanctions against the world's most popular search engine.However, the commission previously considered and rejected big data issues when it approved Google's acquisition of online advertising firm DoubleClick in 2008 and Facebook's purchase of WhatsApp in 2014.

797,"  SAN FRANCISCO Amazon Inc on Thursday introduced two new gadgets similar to its voice-controlled Echo speaker, which can be used to check the weather, order Domino's pizza or hail an Uber car.Amazon Tap, a portable speaker that streams music, sells for $129.99. The $89.99 Echo Dot is a hockey puck-shaped device that responds to prompts to control smart appliances and connects to external speakers.For now, Echo Dot is only available to Amazon Prime members who already have the original Echo device and Amazon's Fire TV set-top box. The original Echo, launched in 2014, is larger and cannot connect to external speakers.""Lots of customers who have used Echo told us that portability was a must,"" said David Limp, senior vice president of devices at Amazon, explaining the company's decision to develop Tap, a soda can-shaped speaker that can connect remotely to music streaming services.The gadgets are part of the company's efforts to position itself as a leader in smart homes, which allow consumers to control various connected appliances like refrigerators and lights from a central hub such as Echo or a mobile phone.  Last year Amazon opened up Alexa, the digital assistant that powers Echo, to third-party developers and added hundreds of new features like access to music streaming service Spotify and integration with smart lights made by Phillips.Amazon also announced on Thursday a special interface to allow thermostat makers like Nest and Honeywell to connect their appliances with Echo.Amazon does not release sales figures for the Echo, so it is unclear how well the device is selling. Other tech companies including Alphabet Inc's Google and International Business Machines Corp are also racing to introduce products to control smart homes.Amazon is also not alone in investing in digital assistants, which can provide valuable data to technology companies about their consumers' interests, preferences and spending habits.

798,"   By Tom Bergin | LONDON  LONDON Facebook FB.0 said it would ditch a corporate structure that helps minimize its UK tax bill, prompting lawmakers and campaigners to ask whether the arrangement had ever complied with UK tax rules.    Facebook said on Friday it would stop booking sales to major UK clients via an Irish subsidiary and in future report sales agreed by UK staff in Britain.    ""In light of changes to tax law in the UK, we felt this change would provide transparency to Facebook's operations in the UK,"" the company said in a statement.    The change follows the British government's introduction last year of a new tax on profits shifted offshore.    ""From the start of April ... UK sales made directly by our UK team will be booked in the UK, not Ireland,"" Facebook added.    The California-based company declined to say if it currently booked sales made by UK-based staff, to UK clients, in Dublin.     If it did, this would break UK and international tax rules, which require companies to book sales where they are made.    Caroline Flint, member of parliament (MP) with the opposition Labour party, said the statement ""raises more questions than it answers"".    ""Facebook are trying to improve their corporate reputation but, in so doing, they appear to have confirmed that UK-based staff were conducting UK sales in the UK, but artificially diverting that income as though it was generated by Facebook Ireland,"" she said.    Labour MP Nick Smith said the UK tax authority, Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC), should have challenged Facebook's arrangement before now.      ""Both HMRC and Facebook need to be brought to book over this,"" he said.“HMRC should not just give Facebook a wrap over the knuckles over this,” he added.     A Facebook spokesman said ""we are compliant with UK tax law"".A spokesman for the tax authority said ""HMRC ensures that all multinationals pay the tax due under UK law"".ECHO OF GOOGLE In 2013, the parliamentary public accounts committee (PAC) investigated Google over the way it reported revenues from UK clients in Ireland, following a Reuters investigation which showed Google employed dozens of UK salespeople, despite denying staff in Britain made sales to UK clients. Google said then and now that UK customers transacted directly with the company’s Irish staff.    A PAC report said in 2013 that Google’s structure was ""contrived"" and criticized HMRC for being too lenient on big businesses. Google says it complied with all tax rules and HMRC said it treated all taxpayers equally.    Google, now part of holding group Alphabet, in January agreed to pay 130 million pounds ($184 million) in UK back taxes and interest and said it would also start to report more revenue in Britain.    Crawford Spence, Professor of Accounting at Warwick Business School, said Facebook’s new arrangements lacked sufficient transparency to tell if they would result in the company paying a “fair share” of tax.Prem Sikka, Professor of Accounting at Essex University, said Facebook could easily use alternative arrangements, such as inter-group charges to shift profits out of Britain as effectively under the new arrangement as it does under the current system.    HMRC has previously downplayed the potential that increased reporting of revenue in Britain would lead to higher tax bills. The tax authority says it assesses how much value a multinational creates in the UK and assesses its tax bill on that basis, rather than simply following the company’s own accounts of where profits are generated.    Facebook's main UK subsidiary said it had a 28 million pounds loss in 2014, the most recent year for which accounts are available, and a tax charge of just 4,327 pounds. The group does not report UK revenue but analysts said it was likely to run to hundreds of millions of pounds.    The company declined to answer questions about its potential future UK tax bills.    A spokeswoman for Prime Minister for David Cameron said on Friday the government was ""committed to making sure that multinationals pay their fair share of tax"".    Facebook declined to say whether it planned to change its structure in other European countries.    Unlike Google, which shifts non-U.S. profits to Bermuda, a territory with no corporate income tax, Facebook moves profits from overseas back to the United States which has the highest corporate income tax rate in the world.However, this does not lead to big tax payments since it has billion of dollars in tax losses related to investments from earlier years, a Reuters analysis of its filings shows.

809,"   By David Henry | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Depositors at some of the largest U.S. banks are finally going to get the chance to do something quick and simple: send money to another person's account instantaneously by mobile phone.The idea has been in the works for at least five years, and in the meantime, Silicon Valley has made incursions into the industry's role as a payment intermediary. But now, big banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co, Bank of America Corp, Wells Fargo & Co and U.S. Bancorp are starting to plug into a system they jointly own, called clearXchange, that will allow each others' customers to transfer money in a flash when they split a dinner check, rent payment or vacation bill.""What we are doing now is delivering payments in real time, which is what our customers have asked for,"" Mary Harman, managing director for payments at Bank of America, said in an interview. The bank is one of two that have started rolling out the system to customers.While technology companies like PayPal Holdings and Facebook Inc already offer snazzy payment apps that appeal to young consumers, the banking industry has a crucial advantage because it controls how quickly money actually moves between bank accounts. Individuals transferred some $200 billion to one another using mobile phones and computers last year, according to Javelin Strategy & Research.Bank executives and analysts who closely track payment systems say that if clearXchange is fast, functional and user-friendly, banks can make up for lost ground.Bank of America plans to announce on Wednesday that its customers can transfer funds instantly through clearXchange with customers of U.S. Bancorp, which said last week that it was plugged into the speediest part of the network. JPMorgan Chase & Co and Capital One Financial Corp representatives told Reuters they plan to offer the service later this year. Wells Fargo & Co said on Wednesday that it is working to roll out instant payments in the middle of this year.Analysts expect PNC Financial Services Group Inc will also start this year. A representative declined to comment.Those six banks are among the seven largest by deposits in the United States.  Regional bank BB&T Corp is also one of the seven owners of the network, but is not ready to announce its plans, a spokesman said.Citigroup, which has the fourth most U.S. deposits, has not joined clearXchange. A spokeswoman declined to say why. Citigroup uses an older network called Popmoney, which is owned by Fiserv Inc, for person-to-person payments. SLOW TO ADAPT Today, if a customer wants to transfer cash to another person digitally — whether on an app like Paypal's Venmo, or through an individual bank's payment transfer system, like Chase's QuickPay — it usually takes one to three days for money to move to an account at another institution. On clearXchange, the cash can move instantaneously with the tap of a finger.The initiative is particularly important for banks as their customer base shifts from a generation that cashed paper checks and got mortgages by walking into a branch, to one that goes online first to transact and borrow. It's important for banks to cater to 18-to-34-year-old Americans in the so-called Millennial generation as they enter their prime years for borrowing and saving.But adapting to these behavioral changes was a low priority for U.S. banks after the financial crisis, as they grappled with losses, fines, new regulations and slow revenue growth. In short order, financial technology startups filled the void — not just in payments, but in areas ranging from student loans to financial planning. If banks don't catch up quickly, they may end up losing some young customers altogether, analysts said.""There is a short window of opportunity for the banks,"" said Michael Moeser, director of payments for Javelin.For clearXchange to be successful, it needs to reach a critical mass of participants so that depositors will be able to transfer funds among most of their friends, relatives and colleagues. Until more banks connect to provide immediate service, the network has little value. Any U.S. bank or credit union can participate in clearXchange, and its owners hope many more will. The network says its members represent two-thirds of U.S. deposits.Banks in other parts of the world are making similar moves. In the U.K., for instance, there is an app called Paym that allows individuals to transfer up to 250 pounds ($355) to another user's bank account. Nordic countries are leading the way toward a cashless society, with mobile payment apps Swish in Sweden and MobilePay in Denmark.Analysts expect the mobile banking market to keep growing as consumers become more aware of apps, and as the technology improves.VIRAL NATURE Venmo, which launched in 2012, handled $7.5 billion of person-to-person payments last year. In January, the company moved $1 billion between individuals – up tenfold in two years, said Bill Ready, PayPal's global head of product and engineering, who brought Venmo to PayPal as part of a 2013 deal. Those figures track well below the $22 billion of cash swapped digitally by Bank of America customers last year, or the $20 billion Chase QuickPay handled. But Venmo is growing rapidly, and its popularity has come almost entirely by word of mouth, as friends ask friends to sign up, said Ready. Facebook's Messenger app offers a similar service.While these apps send immediate alerts that money is on the way, they still rely on banks to make sure cash is available and move it.

810,"   By David Henry | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Depositors at some of the largest U.S. banks are finally going to get the chance to do something quick and simple: send money to another person's account instantaneously by mobile phone.The idea has been in the works for at least five years, and in the meantime, Silicon Valley has made incursions into the industry's role as a payment intermediary. But now, big banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co, Bank of America Corp, Wells Fargo & Co and U.S. Bancorp are starting to plug into a system they jointly own, called clearXchange, that will allow each others' customers to transfer money in a flash when they split a dinner check, rent payment or vacation bill.""What we are doing now is delivering payments in real time, which is what our customers have asked for,"" Mary Harman, managing director for payments at Bank of America, said in an interview. The bank is one of two that have started rolling out the system to customers.While technology companies like PayPal Holdings and Facebook Inc already offer snazzy payment apps that appeal to young consumers, the banking industry has a crucial advantage because it controls how quickly money actually moves between bank accounts. Individuals transferred some $200 billion to one another using mobile phones and computers last year, according to Javelin Strategy & Research.Bank executives and analysts who closely track payment systems say that if clearXchange is fast, functional and user-friendly, banks can make up for lost ground.Bank of America plans to announce on Wednesday that its customers can transfer funds instantly through clearXchange with customers of U.S. Bancorp, which said last week that it was plugged into the speediest part of the network. JPMorgan Chase & Co and Capital One Financial Corp representatives told Reuters they plan to offer the service later this year. Wells Fargo & Co said on Wednesday that it is working to roll out instant payments in the middle of this year.Analysts expect PNC Financial Services Group Inc will also start this year. A representative declined to comment.Those six banks are among the seven largest by deposits in the United States.  Regional bank BB&T Corp is also one of the seven owners of the network, but is not ready to announce its plans, a spokesman said.Citigroup, which has the fourth most U.S. deposits, has not joined clearXchange. A spokeswoman declined to say why. Citigroup uses an older network called Popmoney, which is owned by Fiserv Inc, for person-to-person payments. SLOW TO ADAPT Today, if a customer wants to transfer cash to another person digitally — whether on an app like Paypal's Venmo, or through an individual bank's payment transfer system, like Chase's QuickPay — it usually takes one to three days for money to move to an account at another institution. On clearXchange, the cash can move instantaneously with the tap of a finger.The initiative is particularly important for banks as their customer base shifts from a generation that cashed paper checks and got mortgages by walking into a branch, to one that goes online first to transact and borrow. It's important for banks to cater to 18-to-34-year-old Americans in the so-called Millennial generation as they enter their prime years for borrowing and saving.But adapting to these behavioral changes was a low priority for U.S. banks after the financial crisis, as they grappled with losses, fines, new regulations and slow revenue growth. In short order, financial technology startups filled the void — not just in payments, but in areas ranging from student loans to financial planning. If banks don't catch up quickly, they may end up losing some young customers altogether, analysts said.""There is a short window of opportunity for the banks,"" said Michael Moeser, director of payments for Javelin.For clearXchange to be successful, it needs to reach a critical mass of participants so that depositors will be able to transfer funds among most of their friends, relatives and colleagues. Until more banks connect to provide immediate service, the network has little value. Any U.S. bank or credit union can participate in clearXchange, and its owners hope many more will. The network says its members represent two-thirds of U.S. deposits.Banks in other parts of the world are making similar moves. In the U.K., for instance, there is an app called Paym that allows individuals to transfer up to 250 pounds ($355) to another user's bank account. Nordic countries are leading the way toward a cashless society, with mobile payment apps Swish in Sweden and MobilePay in Denmark.Analysts expect the mobile banking market to keep growing as consumers become more aware of apps, and as the technology improves.VIRAL NATURE Venmo, which launched in 2012, handled $7.5 billion of person-to-person payments last year. In January, the company moved $1 billion between individuals – up tenfold in two years, said Bill Ready, PayPal's global head of product and engineering, who brought Venmo to PayPal as part of a 2013 deal. Those figures track well below the $22 billion of cash swapped digitally by Bank of America customers last year, or the $20 billion Chase QuickPay handled. But Venmo is growing rapidly, and its popularity has come almost entirely by word of mouth, as friends ask friends to sign up, said Ready. Facebook's Messenger app offers a similar service.While these apps send immediate alerts that money is on the way, they still rely on banks to make sure cash is available and move it. And, unlike banks, they have no control over the speed at which that occurs.""As a Bank of America customer, when I hit send, a couple of seconds later the U.S. Bank customer will see the money in their account,"" said Bank of America's Harman.Even so, Ready, the senior PayPal executive, said he is skeptical clearXchange will be a success.

821,"   By Yasmeen Abutaleb and Piya Sinha-Roy | SAN FRANCISCO/LOS ANGELES  SAN FRANCISCO/LOS ANGELES Facebook Inc (FB.O) on Wednesday expanded its live video product, Facebook Live, giving the feature prominent placement on its app and rolling out features to make it easier for users to search and comment in real time.The move is the biggest challenge yet by Facebook to online rivals, including Twitter Inc's (TWTR.N) Periscope live-streaming service, Snapchat's video features and Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) YouTube, as well as a potential threat to broadcast television.Live video is becoming a highly competitive feature on social platforms, with companies competing to stream major sports events and exclusive video components from high-profile events such as the Oscar and Grammy awards shows.Advertisers are particularly attracted to video that reaches a younger audience. Facebook Live, which offers streaming video in real time, was launched last year. On Wednesday, it added features, including a map of video streams around the world, expanded search and filters that echo those on other platforms.

822,"   By Yasmeen Abutaleb and Piya Sinha-Roy | SAN FRANCISCO/LOS ANGELES  SAN FRANCISCO/LOS ANGELES Facebook Inc (FB.O) on Wednesday expanded its live video product, Facebook Live, giving the feature prominent placement on its app and rolling out features to make it easier for users to search and comment in real time.The move is the biggest challenge yet by Facebook to online rivals, including Twitter Inc's (TWTR.N) Periscope live-streaming service, Snapchat's video features and Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) YouTube, as well as a potential threat to broadcast television.Live video is becoming a highly competitive feature on social platforms, with companies competing to stream major sports events and exclusive video components from high-profile events such as the Oscar and Grammy awards shows.Advertisers are particularly attracted to video that reaches a younger audience. Facebook Live, which offers streaming video in real time, was launched last year. On Wednesday, it added features, including a map of video streams around the world, expanded search and filters that echo those on other platforms. Videos can be turned into black-and-white shots, like on Facebook's Instagram, for instance, and soon users will be able to add doodles, a nod to a feature on Snapchat.

823,"   By Yasmeen Abutaleb | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Facebook Inc said on Tuesday it has opened up its Messenger app to developers to create ""chatbots,"" hoping that by simulating one-on-one conversations between users and companies it will expand its reach in customer service and enterprise transactions.Chatbots are automated programs that help users communicate with businesses and carry out tasks such as online purchases. While chatbots have existed in some form for years, they have recently become a hot topic in the tech business as advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning make them far more capable and potentially able to assume a key role in the way customers communicate with businesses.Facebook launched chatbots on Tuesday with a handful of partners, including Shopify, an ecommerce site, and cable TV news network CNN.The chatbots are part of Facebook's effort to build out its  Messenger instant messaging app as the go-to place for customers to contact businesses - a strategy that threatens traditional call centers and may cut personnel costs for some businesses.""You'll never have to call 1-800-Flowers again,"" Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said during the company's annual developer conference in San Francisco. Though messaging platforms including Kik, Slack and Telegram already have chatbots, Facebook is seen having several distinct advantages.For one, Facebook commands a vast trove of data on the estimated 1.6 billion people who use the main service and the 900 million who use Messenger. That allows developers to create chatbots that can personalize tasks, such as making an airline booking or a restaurant reservation.""From the enterprise or developer perspective, access to those 1.6 billion people is very exciting,"" said Lauren Kunze, principal at Pandorabots, which has been building and deploying chatbots for companies since 2002.  ""People like a personalized experience and when the chatbot can remember personal details and follow up,"" she said. CNN's bot, for example, can learn users' news preferences and recommend articles and summaries accordingly. For a shopping site, users could input price ranges and other preferences before receiving suggestions from the bot. Tech companies will have to approach chatbots more carefully, however, after an experimental Microsoft Corp bot, called Tay, unleashed a barrage of racist and sexist tweets after being manipulated by Twitter users last month. The company quickly pulled Tay from the Internet. A PLACE FOR BUSINESS Facebook has been steadily adding features to Messenger since it was spun off as a separate app in 2014. Last year, it partnered with Uber [UBER.UL] and Lyft so that users can order a car without having to go through the ride-sharing apps. It also recently partnered with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines so that customers can receive flight updates and booking confirmations through Messenger. Chatbots could eventually automate such interactions and eliminate customer service calls.  ""You're offloading the pain of navigating those phone systems,"" said Chris Fohlin, director of client strategy at consulting agency Engine Digital.Last year, Facebook partnered with online shopping sites Zulily and Everlane to send customer receipts and order updates through Messenger. It now sees 1 billion messages sent between users and businesses every month, said Seth Rosenberg, Messenger's product manager. That prompted the company to begin experimenting with chatbots. ""Our goal is to make personalization available at scale for businesses,"" Seth Rosenberg, Messenger's product manager, said in an interview. ""It's giving them ways to deeply engage with their consumers as everything becomes more competitive.""By making Messenger the go-to place for business-to-person interactions, Facebook hopes people will spend even more time using the app and increasingly rely on it for day-to-day tasks.Facebook's chatbots could also threaten businesses' individual apps. Although there are millions of apps, users spend nearly 90 percent of their time on five apps, according to research firm Forrester. In the United States, two of those apps are typically Facebook and Messenger.

825,"   By Sarah McBride | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Billionaire Internet investor Yuri Milner announced another $100 million initiative on Tuesday to better understand the cosmos, this time by deploying thousands of tiny spacecraft to travel to our nearest neighboring star system and send back pictures.If successful, scientists could determine if Alpha Centauri, a star system about 25 trillion miles away, contains an Earth-like planet capable of sustaining life.The catch: It could take years to develop the project, dubbed Breakthrough Starshot, and there is no guarantee it will work.Tuesday’s announcement, made with cosmologist Stephen Hawking, comes less than a year after the announcement of Breakthrough Listen. That decade-long, $100 million project, also backed by Milner, monitors radio signals for signs of intelligent life across the universe.Breakthrough Starshot involves deploying small light-propelled vehicles to carry equipment like cameras and communication equipment. Scientists hope the vehicles, known as nanocraft, will eventually fly at 20 percent of the speed of light, more than a thousand times faster than today’s spacecraft. “The thing would look like the chip from your cell phone with this very thin gauzy light sail,” said Pete Worden, the former director of NASA’s Ames Research Center, who is leading the project. “It would be something like 10, 12 feet across.”He envisions sending a larger conventional spacecraft containing thousands of nanocraft into orbit, and then launching the nanocraft one by one, he said in an interview.The idea has precedents with mixed results.   Two years ago, Cornell University's KickSat fizzled after the craft carrrying 104 micro-satellites into space failed to release them. The plan was to let the tiny satellites orbit and collect data for a few weeks.Worden acknowledges challenges, including the nanocraft surviving impact on launch. They would then endure 20 years of travel through the punishing environment of interstellar space, with obstacles such as dust collisions.“The problems remaining to be solved - any one of them are showstoppers,” Worden said.  Governments likely would not take on the research due to its speculative nature, he said, yet the technology is promising enough to merit pursuing.If the nanocraft reach the star system and succeed in taking photographs, it would take about another four years to transmit them back to Earth.A onetime physics PhD student in Moscow who dropped out to move to the United States in 1990, Milner is one of a handful of technology tycoons devoting time and money to space exploration.

836,"   By Yasmeen Abutaleb and Anya George Tharakan  Facebook Inc's (FB.O) quarterly revenue rose more than 50 percent, handily beating Wall Street expectations as its wildly popular mobile app and a push into live video lured new advertisers and encouraged existing ones to boost spending.The company's shares rose 9.5 percent in after-hours trading on Wednesday to $118.39, setting it on track to open at a new high on Thursday, at nearly triple its initial public offering four years ago. Facebook also announced it will create a new class of non-voting shares in a move aimed at letting Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg give away his wealth without relinquishing control of the social media juggernaut he founded.The company plans to create a new class of non-voting shares, which would be given as a dividend to existing shareholders. That would allow Zuckerberg, who wants to give away 99 percent of his wealth, to sell non-voting stock to fund philanthropy and keep the voting stock that assures his control.Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) passed a similar proposal in 2014 that ensured its founders' control by creating new non-voting shares. Some 1.65 billion people used Facebook monthly as of March 31, up from 1.44 billion a year earlier. Zuckerberg said users were spending more than 50 minutes per day on Facebook, Instagram and Messenger, a huge amount of time given the millions of apps available to users.Advertisers are shifting money from television to web and mobile platforms, and Facebook is one of the biggest beneficiaries. It faces fierce competition in the mobile video market, where rivals Snapchat and YouTube also garner billions of video views every day.Facebook recently expanded its live video product, rolling out several new features and making it more prominent on the app to encourage users to create videos and share them. The quarterly results showed success attracting advertisers with the move, and the company was able to expand its operating profit margin to 55 percent from 52 percent a year earlier. ""The company consistently 'warns' about higher spending, but they consistently manage their spending to deliver earnings upside. They're an impressive company, and they leave very little room for criticism,"" said Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter, who called the operating margin a good surprise.Facebook did not offer details on sales of its Oculus Rift virtual reality headset, but emphasized that it was early days and said that sales would not significantly impact 2016 revenue.The results come after disappointments for investors from several major Silicon Valley firms.""After Intel and IBM last week, and then Twitter and Apple yesterday, this is by far the best number I’ve seen in technology,"" said Daniel Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust Company which owns about $40 million worth of Facebook shares, commenting specifically about Facebook ad revenue.Facebook has not begun advertising on some of its most popular apps. ""They haven't yet turned on the monetization spigot for Messenger or WhatsApp, so there should be significant headroom still,"" said Jan Dawson, chief analyst at Jackdaw Research. The company's net income attributable to common shareholders nearly tripled to $1.51 billion, or 52 cents per share, in the first quarter from $509 million, or 18 cents per share, a year earlier.Excluding items, the company earned 77 cents per share, beating Wall Street's 62-cent consensus.Total revenue rose to $5.38 billion from $3.54 billion, with ad revenue increasing 56.8 percent to $5.20 billion. Mobile ad revenue accounted for about 82 percent of total ad revenue, compared with about 73 percent a year earlier.Analysts on average had expected revenue of $5.26 billion. If the stock proposal is approved - and Zuckerberg has a majority of voting stock - the company will effectively carry out a 3-for-1 stock split, issuing two shares of non-voting Class C capital stock as a one-time stock dividend for each share of Class A and Class B common stock.Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, announced last year that they would give away 99 percent of their Facebook shares to fund charitable endeavors. Investors said they were not concerned that Zuckerberg would have increasing control, pointing to the company's consistent ability to grow and exceed expectations. ""I honestly don't think anyone cares if he has more power, since he's done everything right since they went public,"" said Pachter.

839,"   By Yasmeen Abutaleb and Anya George Tharakan  Facebook Inc's (FB.O) quarterly revenue rose more than 50 percent, handily beating Wall Street expectations as its wildly popular mobile app and a push into live video lured new advertisers and encouraged existing ones to boost spending.The company's shares rose 9.5 percent in after-hours trading on Wednesday to $118.39, setting it on track to open at a new high on Thursday, at nearly triple its initial public offering four years ago. Facebook also announced it will create a new class of non-voting shares in a move aimed at letting Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg give away his wealth without relinquishing control of the social media juggernaut he founded.The company plans to create a new class of non-voting shares, which would be given as a dividend to existing shareholders. That would allow Zuckerberg, who wants to give away 99 percent of his wealth, to sell non-voting stock to fund philanthropy and keep the voting stock that assures his control.Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) passed a similar proposal in 2014 that ensured its founders' control by creating new non-voting shares. Some 1.65 billion people used Facebook monthly as of March 31, up from 1.44 billion a year earlier. Zuckerberg said users were spending more than 50 minutes per day on Facebook, Instagram and Messenger, a huge amount of time given the millions of apps available to users.Advertisers are shifting money from television to web and mobile platforms, and Facebook is one of the biggest beneficiaries. It faces fierce competition in the mobile video market, where rivals Snapchat and YouTube also garner billions of video views every day.Facebook recently expanded its live video product, rolling out several new features and making it more prominent on the app to encourage users to create videos and share them. The quarterly results showed success attracting advertisers with the move, and the company was able to expand its operating profit margin to 55 percent from 52 percent a year earlier. ""The company consistently 'warns' about higher spending, but they consistently manage their spending to deliver earnings upside. They're an impressive company, and they leave very little room for criticism,"" said Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter, who called the operating margin a good surprise.Facebook did not offer details on sales of its Oculus Rift virtual reality headset, but emphasized that it was early days and said that sales would not significantly impact 2016 revenue.The results come after disappointments for investors from several major Silicon Valley firms.""After Intel and IBM last week, and then Twitter and Apple yesterday, this is by far the best number I’ve seen in technology,"" said Daniel Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust Company which owns about $40 million worth of Facebook shares, commenting specifically about Facebook ad revenue.Facebook has not begun advertising on some of its most popular apps. ""They haven't yet turned on the monetization spigot for Messenger or WhatsApp, so there should be significant headroom still,"" said Jan Dawson, chief analyst at Jackdaw Research. The company's net income attributable to common shareholders nearly tripled to $1.51 billion, or 52 cents per share, in the first quarter from $509 million, or 18 cents per share, a year earlier.Excluding items, the company earned 77 cents per share, beating Wall Street's 62-cent consensus.Total revenue rose to $5.38 billion from $3.54 billion, with ad revenue increasing 56.8 percent to $5.20 billion. Mobile ad revenue accounted for about 82 percent of total ad revenue, compared with about 73 percent a year earlier.Analysts on average had expected revenue of $5.26 billion. If the stock proposal is approved - and Zuckerberg has a majority of voting stock - the company will effectively carry out a 3-for-1 stock split, issuing two shares of non-voting Class C capital stock as a one-time stock dividend for each share of Class A and Class B common stock.Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, announced last year that they would give away 99 percent of their Facebook shares to fund charitable endeavors. Investors said they were not concerned that Zuckerberg would have increasing control, pointing to the company's consistent ability to grow and exceed expectations. ""I honestly don't think anyone cares if he has more power, since he's done everything right since they went public,"" said Pachter.

840,"   By Laila Kearney  U.S. stocks closed down on Thursday as the Bank of Japan's shocking call to cap monetary stimulus continued to rattle investors while a late day decline in Apple shares on remarks by billionaire investor Carl Icahn added to selling pressure. The benchmark S&P 500 had its worst day in three weeks, losing 19.34 points, or 0.92 percent, to 2,075.81, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 210.79 points, or 1.17 percent, to 17,830.76 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 57.85 points, or 1.19 percent, to 4,805.29.Nine of the major S&P 500 sectors were lower, with information technology's 1.4 percent fall leading the decliners. Consumer staples rose 0.03 percent.""This really personifies how important central bank policy is on the market,"" said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank.Stocks fell early in the day on the BOJ's decision to hold steady in the face of soft global demand and a rise in the yen, jarring markets particularly after media reports that the central bank would likely go deeper into negative interest rates.Wall Street dipped further late in the day, led by a decline in Apple stock.Shares of Apple, already suffering from disappointing earnings, took another hit after billionaire investor Carl Icahn said he no longer has a position. Apple was last down 3 percent at $94.87.  Icahn, in an interview with cable television network CNBC, also said he was ""still very cautious"" on the U.S. stock market and there would be a ""day of reckoning"" unless there was some sort of fiscal stimulus.The comments appeared to reverse a modest midday stock market recovery on Facebook's stellar earnings, which pushed the company's stock to record high levels, and a flurry of dealmaking news.St. Jude Medical jumped 25.5 percent to $77.79 after Abbott Laboratories said it agreed to buy the medical device maker for $25 billion. Abbott fell 7.7 percent at $40.42. DreamWorks Animation rose 24 percent at $39.95, after Comcast said it will buy the company for $3.8 billion. Comcast closed down 0.2 percent at $61.86. The U.S. stock market is on its second-longest bull run ever. The S&P 500, which is nearing its record high, has rallied 15 percent since February, helped by a recovery in oil prices and an accommodating Fed. The U.S. dollar index has fallen about 4.7 percent since the start of the year against a basket of major currencies, while oil prices have jumped 75 percent in three months. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 1,942 to 1,036, for a 1.87-to-1 ratio on the downside; on the Nasdaq, 1,867 issues fell and 955 advanced for a 1.95-to-1 ratio favoring decliners. The S&P 500 posted 19 new 52-week highs and 1 new lows; the Nasdaq recorded 63 new highs and 16 new lows.  About 8.1 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, compared with a 6.9 billion daily average over the past 20 sessions.

843,"   By Natalia Scalzaretto and Caio Saad | SAO PAULO/RIO DE JANEIRO  SAO PAULO/RIO DE JANEIRO Facebook Inc's (FB.O) Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg called on Brazilians to demand his company's WhatsApp messaging service  never be blocked again after an appeals court on Tuesday overturned the application's second suspension in five months. In a post in English on his Facebook page, the U.S. billionaire and Facebook founder urged Brazilians to gather outside Congress in the capital Brasilia at 6 p.m. (1700 EDT) on Wednesday to rally in favor of legislation that would prevent Internet services from being blocked.WhatsApp was cut off in Brazil at 2 p.m. (1300 EDT) on Monday after a judge in the remote northeastern state of Sergipe ordered Brazil's five main wireless operators to block access to the app for 72 hours. The reason for the order was not made public. The suspension of WhatsApp's text message and Internet voice telephone service for smartphones was lifted after about 24 hours when an appeals judge on Tuesday ruled in favor of an injunction by the company's lawyers, the court said in a statement. Some 100 million users were affected.""You and your friends can help make sure this never happens again, and I hope you get involved,"" Zuckerberg wrote on Facebook. He also posted a link to a petition, calling efforts to block communication ""very scary in a democracy."" The suspension highlighted growing international tensions between technology companies' privacy concerns and national authorities' efforts to use social media to gain information on possible criminal activities.The same judge in Sergipe ordered the imprisonment of a Brazil-based Facebook executive in March in a dispute over demands to access the company’s encrypted messaging service as part of a drug trafficking investigation.  California-based WhatsApp had said in a statement on Monday that it was ""disappointed"" at the judge's decision to suspend its services. It said it had done the utmost to cooperate with Brazilian tribunals, but it did not possess the information the court was requesting. Matt Steinfeld, a Facebook spokesman, said WhatsApp executives were meeting this week with law enforcement and judicial officials in Brazil to improve communication and clarify that the company cannot see users' encrypted messages and does not store them after transmission. BRAZILIANS ANGERED    It was the second time in five months that WhatsApp in Brazil has been suspended. A São Paulo state judge ordered it shut down for 48 hours on Dec. 15, after Facebook failed to comply with an order. Another court lifted that suspension shortly afterward.Monday's suspension angered many in Brazil, where the service is used by individuals, companies and federal and local governments to send messages and share pictures and videos. Cost-conscious Brazilians are avid users of free messaging apps, and WhatsApp is by far the most popular - installed on more than 90 percent of Android devices. As some Brazilians sought an alternative messaging system, rival Telegram said on Monday that it suffered technical problems under the weight of demand. It said it received more than a million new user requests. Letícia Mendes, a 20-year-old shop assistant in Rio de Janeiro, said she was frustrated by the suspension because it could force people to use pay services.""It's really bad,"" she told Reuters. ""It's just a way of getting more money out of us, when we already have to pay for so many things.""The suspension came as a congressional commission on cyber crime in Brazil debated changes to the 2014 legislation governing the use of the Internet.Lower house deputy Esperidião Amin, the rapporteur of the commission, said his proposed reform would help avoid shutdowns of this kind by allowing the blocking of specific individuals or IP addresses suspected of illicit activity, rather than the access of all users.""It's less dramatic than withdrawing the service from the whole of the Brazilian population,"" he told Reuters by telephone.

844,"  BRASILIA A Brazilian congressional commission on Wednesday recommended a bill that forbids authorities from blocking popular messaging applications, just two days after a judicial order left 100 million Brazilians without Facebook Inc's WhatsApp.A Brazilian judge on Tuesday overturned a 72-hour suspension of the application used by roughly half the population of the South American country, triggering popular outcry over its second judicial suspension in only five months.The reason for the freeze was not made public due to legal secrecy in an ongoing case in a Sergipe state court, but authorities have in the past demanded data from the Facebook's encrypted messaging service.    A congressional commission investigating cyber crimes proposed removing messaging applications, such as WhatsApp, from a bill that regulates the suspension of websites and other applications used for crimes such as drugs and arms trafficking. ""This way the legislation makes it very clear that judges cannot block these applications, because those suspensions do not fulfill their objectives,"" lawmaker Sandro Alex, who helped draft the bill, said in a WhatsApp message.  The legislation will now have to pass through several other congressional committees before being put to vote in the floor of the lower and upper house.  Critics have said the bill would actually make it easier for judges to shut down websites and applications, hurting the freedom of speech of internet users.      The judge who ordered Monday's 72-hour suspension, Marcel Maia Montalvao, in March ordered the imprisonment of a Brazil-based Facebook executive in a dispute over law enforcement demands for data from the company’s encrypted messaging service for use in a drug trafficking investigation. The executive was freed after about 24 hours, when an appeals court overturned his arrest. WhatsApp had said in a statement on Monday that it was ""disappointed"" at the judge's decision to suspend its services, saying it had done its utmost to cooperate with Brazilian tribunals but did not possess the information the court was requesting.The company has said in the past that it does not store encrypted information from WhatsApp messages.

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and other executives have made concerted efforts to woo Chinese officials. In March, Zuckerberg had a rare meeting with the country's propaganda tsar, a suggestion of warming relations between Facebook and the government. Zuckerberg frequently makes headlines in China, where he has achieved celebrity status by making speeches in Mandarin and sharing pictures of runs through noxious smog in Beijing's Tiananmen Square.Facebook had previously objected to China's Trademark Review and Adjudication Board twice but was unsuccessful, prompting its decision to take the case to court.",2016-05-09,FB,"Mon May 9, 2016 | 7:46am EDT",Facebook beverages won't be a thing in China after rare trademark win,http://www.reuters.com//article/facebook-china-copyright-idUSL2N1860CK?type=companyNews
849,"   By Steve Gorman  Facebook Inc's No. 2 executive, Sheryl Sandberg, paid a Mother's Day tribute to single moms, acknowledging she never fully understood the difficulty of raising children without a spouse or partner until her husband died last year.""I did not really get how hard it is to succeed at work when you are overwhelmed at home,"" she wrote in a weekend message posted to her own Facebook account, adding that the death of her husband, Dave Goldberg, ""has redefined what it is to be a mother.""Sandberg, 46, who joined Facebook in 2008 as the chief operating officer for the popular social media platform, lost her husband to a treadmill accident while they were vacationing in Mexico in May 2015.The couple, married for 11 years, had two children together, a son and daughter. ""Before Dave died, I had a partner who shared both the joys and responsibilities of parenting. Then, without warning, I was on my own,"" Sandberg wrote.She also called for greater public and corporate support for single, working mothers, citing data showing the number of women raising their children alone in the United States has nearly doubled since the 1970s, and that 40 percent of such families live in poverty.The United States is the world's only developed economy lacking paid maternity leave as a matter of national policy, and 35 percent of single U.S. mothers experience food insecurity, she said. Sandberg's message did not mention Facebook's own parental leave policy, which provides four months of paid leave to all full-time employees when they become new mothers or fathers.""I realize how extremely fortunate I am not to face the financial burdens so many single mothers and widows face,"" wrote Sandberg, whose net worth Forbes magazine places at $1.4 billion. She also acknowledged how some critics had complained that she gave short shrift to the difficulties faced by single, working women in the bestselling 2013 book she co-wrote, ""Lean In: Women, Work and the Will to Lead.""""They were right,"" she said. ""I will never experience and understand all of the challenges most single moms face, but I understand a lot more than I did a year ago.""

871,"   By Julia Fioretti | BRUSSELS  BRUSSELS Exempting some online applications, such as Facebook, from consumers' monthly data caps and treating them as free is seen as the next front in a battle over how telecoms operators can manage the traffic on their networks as regulators prepare to enforce Europe's first-ever ""net neutrality"" rules.BEREC, the body comprising the European Union's 28 telecoms regulators, on Monday produced a set of draft guidelines on implementing the net neutrality rules which require operators such as Orange, Deutsche Telekom and Telefonica to treat all Internet traffic equally.Deciding whether operators should be allowed to devote part of their network to certain services, such as remote healthcare, will be much simpler than deciding whether offering content for free, such as Facebook and Spotify, breaches the principle of net neutrality, Sebastien Soriano, head of France's telecoms regulator ARCEP, told Reuters.""This is really in the grey area of the regulation,"" Soriano, who will preside over BEREC next year, said.The EU's net neutrality rules, agreed last year, neither explicitly allow the practice of zero-rating - exempting certain applications from a customer's data allowance - nor forbid it, leaving regulators in a bind.Some countries, such as the Netherlands, Slovenia and India, have banned zero-rating on the grounds that it violates the principle of net neutrality and gives some applications an unfair competitive advantage. ""Zero-­rating allows ISPs (Internet service providers) to make certain applications more attractive than others, thereby picking winners and losers online,"" the European Digital Rights association said.Telecoms operators argue that zero-rating is beneficial for consumers and can be used to give low-income customers improved Internet access, much like Facebook Inc's attempt to offer its own social network and messaging service for free in India.BEREC's guidelines say that regulators should decide whether zero-rating is allowed depending on the market share of both the operator and the company providing the free content. Soriano said that as a result, the issue will have to be treated on a case-by-case basis.""Maybe in one country, one practice of zero-rating will be OK considering the market shares of the operators or the partners ... and in other countries it will raise many problems.""For example, treating a music service such as Spotify as free and therefore exempting it from a customer's data allowance ""creates an economic incentive to use that music application instead of competing ones,"" the guidelines say. BEREC said that blocking access to all content except that which is treated as free once a customer hits his data cap will be forbidden.But sponsored data, whereby content providers such as Spotify or Netflix pay operators to deliver their services for free, raises more difficult issues because no content is actually being blocked.""Technically all the traffic is treated in the same way, but at the tariff level, some services are untariffed and others are,"" Soriano said. ""This question is open. This is at the heart of the grey area of what is allowed or not.""

872,"   By Junko Fujita | TOKYO  TOKYO Line Corp [IPO-LINE.T] on Friday said it plans to list shares in Tokyo and New York next month through an initial public offering (IPO) that would value the Japanese messaging app operator at 588 billion yen ($5.50 billion).Tokyo-headquartered Line said it could raise as much as 112.7 billion yen, making the IPO Japan's biggest of the year. The company, owned by South Korea's Naver Corp, plans to use the proceeds for expansion at home and abroad, at a time when growth in user numbers has markedly slowed.""Line is well-recognised so its shares will be popular,"" said equity strategist Mitsuo Shimizu at Japan Asia Securities Group. ""But as a company, it has passed its peak and is not going to grow fast from now.""Line's listing marks the next phase for a company whose fortunes changed after a devastating earthquake and tsunami in March 2011. The chaotic aftermath of the disaster prompted the company to launch messaging app NHN Japan to aid communication.The years since saw it rebrand in 2013 and expand into 230 markets. Its free-of-charge app generates revenue through sales of electronic stickers and tokens for in-app games, as well as services such as music streaming and taxi hailing.But while the IPO proceeds could help bolster an international push, the Line app is eclipsed in major Western markets by Facebook Inc's Messenger and Whatsapp, while China is dominated by Tencent Holdings Ltd's WeChat.Moreover, growth in its number of monthly active users has tapered having tripled over the past three years. Last year, users numbers rose just 13 million to 218 million at the end of March, the IPO filing showed. That made Line the seventh-most used messenger app globally, far behind WhatsApp with 1 billion monthly active users and Messenger with 900 million, as well as WeChat with 697 million, showed data from researcher Statista.It boasts the most users among messaging apps in Japan, but the only other markets it leads are Taiwan, Thailand and Turkmenistan, showed data last month from researcher SimilarWeb.""Line will not be able to enjoy growth in user numbers over the long term,"" said analyst Hideki Yasuda at Ace Research Institute. ""It needs to shift focus to boost revenue per user."" Line plans to sell 13 million new shares in Japan and 22 million abroad at an indicative price of 2,800 yen each. Its parent, Korea's largest web portal operator, will offer as many as 5.25 million existing shares in the event of strong demand.Naver's ownership will fall to as low as 80.8 percent.Line said it plans to use the proceeds for strategic investment and to repay debt.It also said, for last year, it booked revenue of 120.7 billion yen and a net loss of 7.6 billion yen, attributing the loss to the cost of closing an online radio company. Line will set the final price of its shares on July 11 after gauging investor demand, with the aim of listing them on July 14 in New York and July 15 in Tokyo.The company hired Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Nomura to manage the IPO.($1 = 106.9300 yen) (Reporting by Junko Fujita; Additional reporting by Makiko Yamazaki, Yoshiyuki Osada, Chan-Rang Kim and Chris Gallagher; Editing by Christopher Cushing)",2016-06-10,FB,"Fri Jun 10, 2016 | 6:58am EDT","UPDATE 2-Line Corp plans dual Tokyo, New York IPO, valuing firm at $5.5 bln",http://www.reuters.com//article/line-ipo-idUSL4N192191?type=companyNews
873,"   By Jessica DiNapoli and Jared Leone | NEW YORK/ST. PETERSBURG, Fla.  NEW YORK/ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. Gawker Media LLC, an online publishing pioneer, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and put itself up for sale on Friday after a $140 million court judgment against it in a lawsuit brought by former professional wrestler Hulk Hogan over a sex tape.The move followed revelations that Hogan's lawsuit, along with several others against Gawker, were being bankrolled by billionaire investor Peter Thiel, an early backer of Facebook  and a co-founder of PayPal.Thiel's involvement, which stemmed from his ire over Gawker's writings about him and his friends in Silicon Valley, raised alarm bells in U.S. media circles over the prospect of wealthy individuals using the courts to muzzle the press.Gawker vowed to continue operating its seven websites during the bankruptcy process. Media company Ziff Davis LLC has entered an agreement to buy Gawker's assets for a little less than $100 million, according to people familiar with the matter, but that may be only the initial bid in a court-supervised auction likely to take place at the end of July.""Even with his billions, Thiel will not silence our writers,"" Gawker founder and Chief Executive Nick Denton said on Twitter. ""Our sites will thrive - under new ownership - and we'll win in court.""Hogan's lawsuit accused Gawker, Denton and former Gawker editor A.J. Daulerio of violating his privacy by publishing a one minute, 41-second edited video clip featuring Hogan having sex with the wife of his then-best friend, the radio shock jock Bubba the Love Sponge Clem.In March, a six-person jury awarded $60 million to Hogan, 62, for emotional distress and $55 million for economic damages. The jury then added another $25 million in punitive damages. Gawker has vowed to appeal the verdict, and legal experts believe the company has a good chance of eventually having the award thrown out or reduced. But at a post-trial hearing in St. Petersburg, Florida on Friday, Gawker said it had just $5.3 million in cash on hand and faced massive legal bills.The judge agreed to postpone payment of the $140 million judgment while Gawker pursued its appeal, but required the defendants to put up their shares of the company as collateral to be held by Hogan's lawyers.Gawker objected to having Hogan, whose real name is Terry Bollea, hold the collateral and proposed a different arrangement, which the judge rejected. The company then filed for bankruptcy.Gawker filed a separate lawsuit in bankruptcy court on Friday asking the judge to extend the bankruptcy court protections to Denton, Daulerio and other former and current Gawker employees. The lawsuit states that Denton could be forced to file for personal bankruptcy if the lawsuits against him personally are allowed to proceed.Denton owns about 30 percent of Gawker, according to the lawsuit. The company posted revenues of $49.9 million in 2015, according to the documents, and has grown at a compound annual rate of 24 percent over the past 3 years.Gawker and Denton were influential forces in the development of online media, developing a direct, conversational and sometimes-slashing style that dispensed with many journalistic conventions and was widely imitated. Its eagerness to dish salacious gossip was often condemned, but it was also one of the few early digital publishers to build a profitable independent business. Along with its flagship Gawker site, Gawker Media also publishes consumer websites Gizmodo, Lifehacker, Kotaku, Jalopnik, Deadspin and Jezebel.Denton said in a prepared statement that he was ""encouraged"" by the agreement from Ziff Davis, which itself has a long and rocky history. Once a powerful technology trade publisher, the company went through bankruptcy of its own in 2008 and now produces consumer technology websites include AskMen, Computer Shopper and Geek.com.""There's a tremendous fit between the two organizations, from brands to audience to monetization,"" said a spokesman for Ziff Davis. ""We look forward to the possibility of adding these great brands -- and the talented people who support them -- to the Ziff Davis family.""It was not clear on Friday what other bidders might emerge. Univision, which is expanding aggressively in digital media, had previously been cited as a possible suitor.A spokesman for Peter Thiel declined to comment on Gawker's bankruptcy filing.David Houston, an attorney for Hogan, said: ""We have every intention to continue to pursue our judgment against Gawker and to hold them accountable for violating Mr. Bollea's privacy whether it be in the bankruptcy court or any other court.""",2016-06-11,FB,"Fri Jun 10, 2016 | 8:16pm EDT","Gawker Media files for bankruptcy, to go up for sale",http://www.reuters.com//article/gawkermedia-bankruptcy-idUSL1N1921D2?type=companyNews

885,"   By Tom Pfeiffer | LONDON  LONDON Mobile start-up FreedomPop says it is generating revenue from almost half of its British users by providing optional paying services in addition to free voice and data plans. Tumbling data prices mean the cost of launching so-called ""over-the-top"" telecom services to challenge established companies such as BT Group, Telefonica and AT&T has never been lower. But many of the new arrivals have yet to prove they can turn a profit and the industry is watching their performance closely. Los Angeles-based FreedomPop, led by a former head of strategy at BT, has developed technology that analyses users' behavior and sends them targeted offers for paying services such as extra data, online security and multiple phone numbers. CEO Stephen Stokols said FreedomPop has a higher proportion of paying subscribers than messaging service WhatsApp or music site Spotify. ""Our conversion rate in the UK is 48 percent – people converting from free to paid services. Spotify is around 12 percent which is considered pretty good,""  he said.  FreedomPop launched in the U.S. in 2012, came to Britain last September and plans to add Spain next month after raising $109 million in funding from investors including Partech Ventures and Intel Capital. Other investors include Mangrove Capital, DCM and Skype founder Niklas Zennstrom's Atomico.Stokols said he aimed for a deal with a second U.S. wireless network soon and expects FreedomPop to make its first net profit by the end of 2016. He did not give precise numbers for UK subscriber take-up, saying it was ""at six figures"". U.S. carrier Sprint looked at buying FreedomPop last year but the talks ended without a deal. Stokols said Sprint was interested in FreedomPop's technology, which could help it bring down the price of its own subscriber plans and compete better.  FreedomPop partners with Sprint, selling Sprint-compatible phones and allowing Sprint's wholesale data business to benefit from FreedomPop's growth. Stokols sees more tie-ups with telecom companies to offer FreedomPop to their low-price subscription base. He said they stood to gain by making revenue from its data traffic while having none of the customer acquisition or service costs. ""That’s on us. So Sprint is making a ton of money off us... And we take the risk if the model doesn't work,"" said Stokols. ""I presented recently in Silicon Valley to 18 global telcos. The theme was not denial, but ‘how are we going to work together?’""  Start-ups are only part of the threat to the telecoms industry from technology companies. Giants including Google, Facebook and Microsoft are developing their own networks to link their servers and these software-based IP networks can be far less costly to maintain than the complex legacy systems of the telecoms companies. ""There is one clear message - the party is over for the telcos and will not come back.

893,"   By Nate Raymond and Tom Bergin  The U.S. Internal Revenue Service is examining Facebook Inc over its transfer of various rights associated with its worldwide business to a holding company in Ireland, according to court papers.The U.S. Justice Department filed a lawsuit on Wednesday in federal court in San Francisco seeking to enforce IRS summonses served on Facebook and to force the world's largest social network to produce various documents as part of the probe.The lawsuit said the documents relate to an IRS examination of the company's tax liability for 2010, when Facebook's tax return reported royalty income from transfers of intangible property to Facebook Ireland Holdings Unlimited. ""Facebook complies with all applicable rules and regulations in the countries where we operate,"" Anteneh Daniel, a spokesperson for the company, said in a statement on Thursday.Facebook transferred to the Irish company rights associated with its worldwide business, with the exception of the United States and Canada, the lawsuit said. Facebook reduces its tax bill by having non-U.S. clients pay advertising fees directly to an Irish subsidiary called Facebook Ireland Ltd. This subsidiary reported revenues of 4.8 billion euros in 2014, the last year for which accounts are available.But Facebook Ireland Ltd reports low taxable profit, of just 13 million euros in 2014, because it pays a significant chunk of its revenue to another Irish-registered company called Facebook Ireland Holdings, in return for the use of the Facebook platform.The lawsuit said Facebook retained accounting firm Ernst & Young to value the transfers for tax purposes, but noted that information gathered by the IRS to date suggested that the valuation approach was ""problematic.""",2016-07-07,FB,"Thu Jul 7, 2016 | 4:54pm EDT",U.S. tax agency probes Facebook over Ireland asset transfer,http://www.reuters.com//article/facebook-tax-idUSL1N19T28G?type=companyNews

""There is no place for content encouraging violence, direct threats, terrorism or hate speech on Facebook.

898,"  TOKYO Japan's Line Corp (3938.T) (LN.N) saw its shares rocket on their Tokyo debut on Friday, extending a strong start in New York the day before, and taking the value of the messaging app firm to $8.6 billion in the year's biggest tech IPO.The operator of the world's seventh most-used messaging app listed first in New York in a move widely seen as a sign of determination to challenge global peers and eventually expand beyond strongholds of Japan and Southeast Asia.However, Line's 218 million global monthly active users pale in comparison to the 1 billion of market-leader WhatsApp and 900 million of Messenger, both owned by Facebook Inc (FB.O). Tencent Holdings Ltd's (0700.HK) WeChat, which dominates in China, has 697 million.""We're providing the same kind of services as Facebook and Google, the internet giants of the world,"" Chief Executive Takeshi Idezawa said at a Friday news conference. ""Fighting in the same digital arena as them is extremely important for us.""Line opened at 4,900 yen on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, 48.5 percent above the initial public offering (IPO) price of 3,300 yen, thanks to demand from investors hungry for a rare chance to invest in a tech startup. The stock closed at 4,345 yen.The Tokyo offering came after Line sold about 70 percent more shares in New York which closed 26.6 percent above the IPO.""That was a very smooth start,"" said Hiroyuki Fukunaga, chief executive of financial adviser Investrust. However, its inability to break the psychologically nicer-sounding 5,000 yen before falling back might blunt investor enthusiasm, he said.Line launched its eponymous app to overcome downed networks in the aftermath of an earthquake and tsunami in 2011, and quickly emerged as Japan's dominant mobile messaging platform. But the firm itself is controlled by South Korean online media provider Naver Corp (035420.KS) whose stake is now 80.8 percent. ""Line's floating stock is limited, so despite the firm's large market capitalization, the shares could be very volatile,"" said Investrust's Fukunaga.Line earns the bulk of revenue from games and the sale of emojis and electronic stickers. But like Facebook and Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google, advertising is a key source of income, making up more than a third of Line's revenue. ""We have a good balance of revenue sources, and stickers and games are a great business for us,"" Idezawa told Reuters in an interview on Friday, ""But advertising will be a very important growth-driver.""Japan and Thailand are especially ripe for increasing ad-based revenue because of their relatively low rate of digital advertising, Idezawa said. Line's users are mainly in Japan, Taiwan, Thailand and Indonesia.""It's getting saturated in the Japanese market. The question about growth at home is how much Line can sell ads to increase its profit margin,"" said Masashi Oda, general manager of strategic investment at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Asset Management.""Whether Line can expand beyond its core market is key. In the U.S., there is much more competition,"" he said. Last year, revenue and other operating income at Line rose about 28.3 percent to 120.88 billion yen ($1.14 billion). But it reported a net loss of 7.97 billion yen, compared with profit of 2 billion yen in 2014.""I expect net profit to be around 27 billion yen next year,"" said a Tokyo-based fund manager. ""The current share price is about 36 times profit, a bit higher than rivals such as 27 to 28 times at Facebook. So for me, Line's shares have already hit my target price.""Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan and Nomura were among underwriters for the IPO.($1 = 105.7800 yen) (Reporting by Sruthi Shankar in BENGALURU, and Hideyuki Sano, Thomas Wilson and Ayai Tomisawa in TOKYO; Additional reporting by Yoshiyasu Shida; Editing by Stephen Coates and Christopher Cushing)",2016-07-15,FB,"Fri Jul 15, 2016 | 6:45am EDT",UPDATE 4-Japanese chat app Line soars in New York-Tokyo dual listing,http://www.reuters.com//article/line-listing-idUSL4N1A116E?type=companyNews
899,"  SAN FRANCISCO Facebook Inc's Messenger has more than 1 billion users, the social media company said on Wednesday, making it one the world's top three apps just two years after it was split off from Facebook's main app, which is by far and away the most popular. Facebook now owns three apps with more than 1 billion users, underlining its global dominance in the mobile app arena, where it uses its vast user base to make money from advertisers. Its main Facebook app is the most popular, with 1.5 billion monthly active users, followed by Messenger and WhatsApp, the messaging service it bought in 2014. The closest rivals in app charts are Google Maps and YouTube, both owned by Alphabet Inc's Google, according to independent data. Those services do not disclose monthly user numbers for their apps.  Facebook's photo-sharing service Instagram is also quickly gaining users, reporting last month that it had more than 500 million app users.Facebook made Messenger a standalone app in 2014, forcing people to download a separate app rather than allowing them to continue using the private message feature on the main Facebook app. The move initially irked many users, but the app has quickly grown in popularity as the company has added myriad features to the app, such as games.  Facebook has aggressively moved to make Messenger an integral part of its business, by building chatbots - computer programs designed to simulate an intelligent conversation - inside the app, allowing business customers to message users directly.It has also launched a digital assistant, M, to some users in the San Francisco Bay Area that can help with tasks such as sending flowers and making restaurant reservations.

903,"   By Malathi Nayak and Deborah M. Todd | NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO  NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO Verizon Communications Inc said on Monday it would buy Yahoo Inc's core internet properties for $4.83 billion in cash, marking the end of the line for a storied Web pioneer and setting the stage for a big new internet push by the telecom giant.Verizon (VZ.N) will combine Yahoo's (YHOO.O) search, email and messenger assets as well as advertising technology tools with its AOL unit, which it bought last year for $4.4 billion. Verizon has been looking to mobile video and advertising for new sources of revenue outside the oversaturated wireless market.The No. 1 U.S. wireless operator is betting that it can take data on more than 200 million unique monthly visitors to Yahoo sites, many of them on mobile devices, and combine it with data on 150 million or so unique monthly AOL users and data on its own user base of over 100 million wireless subscribers to offer a more targeted service for advertisers. Barclays said last month Verizon could save $500 million a year in costs of acquiring internet traffic and other expenses by buying Yahoo's internet business.The deal likely means more investment in popular content sites such as AOL’s Huffington Post and Yahoo Finance when they become part of a much larger entity.“It now becomes somewhat easier to justify investing in content,” said Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research. Verizon said it would provide more detail on the strategy behind the acquisition when it announces second-quarter earnings on Tuesday.LONG WAY DOWN The deal came after activist investors led by Starboard Value LP lost faith in Yahoo Chief Executive Officer Marissa Mayer, who was hired in 2012, and forced what became a protracted sale process. Yahoo, founded in 1994, was a dominant player in the early days of the internet, but has long lost its leadership position in internet search and advertising to Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google, Facebook Inc (FB.O) and others.Mayer said on a conference call with investors that she planned to stay at Yahoo through the deal's close. Marni Walden, head of product innovation and new business at Verizon, will head the combined internet unit and said no decisions had yet been made on the management team.""Yahoo gives us scale that is what is most critical here,"" said Walden, adding that the company's audience will go from the millions to the billions. ""We want to compete and that is the place we need to be.""Mayer, in an interview with Reuters, said she still saw a ""path to growth"" for Yahoo, especially in mobile. ""What's exciting about the Verizon transaction is that it brings us back to growth sooner,"" she said. She said she was ""open-minded"" about a possible role with the combined companies.But analysts expect AOL CEO Tim Armstrong - like Mayer a one-time Google executive - to be the driving force behind the combined companies. Yahoo is still one of the largest properties on the internet, with hundreds of millions of customers using its email, finance and sports offerings, among others, and a heavily trafficked home page.  But Google has a stranglehold on the internet search business and built an industry-leading email service, while Facebook dominates in mobile and social media. Meanwhile, traditional web banner advertising, long Yahoo's strength, has become much less lucrative in the age of mobile and video.""It's a decade of mismanagement that has finally ended for Yahoo,"" said Recon Analytics analyst Roger Entner. ""It's the continuation of an extension of Verizon's strategy toward becoming a wireless internet player and a move away from (telecom) regulation for Verizon into an unregulated growth industry.Under Armstrong, AOL has beefed up its advertising technology with a string of acquisitions, and launched the mobile video service go90. Verizon has not disclosed how financially successful the unit has been, but Armstrong, known as a formidable salesman, has clearly won the confidence of Verizon's leaders.FAR BEHIND GOOGLE, FACEBOOK  The integration of Yahoo will not come without challenges. In its latest results, it reported a second-quarter net loss of $439.9 million as it wrote down the value of Tumblr, the microblogging and social media service it acquired in 2013 for $1.1 billion. Even with AOL and Yahoo, Verizon would still be far behind s Google and Facebook. According to eMarketer, Yahoo is expected to generate $2.32 billion in net U.S. digital ad sales, while AOL is expected to make $1.3 billion in 2016. Facebook and Google are forecast to deliver sales of $10.3 billion and $24.63 billion, respectively, by the end of this year.The Verizon deal would transform Yahoo into a holding company, with a 15 percent stake in Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N) and a 35.5 percent interest in Yahoo Japan Corp (4689.T) as well as Yahoo's convertible notes, certain minority investments and its non-core patents. Yahoo executives said the remaining company is structured to ""indefinitely"" hold its Yahoo Japan and Alibaba stakes. They are worth about $40 billion based on their market capitalizations, while Yahoo had a market value of about $37.4 billion at Friday's close.Yahoo will continue as an independent company until the deal receives shareholder and regulatory approvals, the companies said. It is expected to close in early 2017. It plans to change its name and become a publicly traded investment company.Yahoo currently has $7.7 billion in cash, in addition to the $4.8 billion it will receive at the close of the deal, which it plans to return to shareholders, Yahoo executives said on the call.Verizon prevailed over rival bidders, including AT&T Inc (T.N); a group led by Quicken Loans founder Dan Gilbert and backed by billionaire Warren Buffett; private equity firm TPG Capital Management LP [TPG.UL]; and a consortium of buyout firms Vector Capital and Sycamore Partners.Under pressure from Starboard, Yahoo launched an auction of its core business in February after shelving plans to spin off its stake in Alibaba.

""We see a world that is video-first with video at the heart of all of our apps and services,"" Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said on a conference call on Wednesday.RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney, who raised his price target to $170 from $165, referred the ""video-ification of the internet"".""(Facebook) is extremely well positioned for this,"" he said.At least a couple of analysts picked up on a comment by Chief Financial Officer David Wehner that Facebook's ad loads - the total number of ads Facebook can show to each user - will grow ""modestly"" over the next 12 months.""Ad load has been a very significant driver of growth and they are actively talking about how ad load has essentially or is getting close to maxing out, which is concerning investors,"" said Richard GreenField, an analyst at BTIG.Still, only one brokerage cut its rating on Facebook's stock. Moness Crespi & Hardt, which had a ""buy"" recommendation, reduced its rating to ""neutral"".The brokerage raised concerns both about the ad loads issue and the large capital spending it said would be required to build Facebook's video offerings.

911,"   By Anya George Tharakan and Sweta Singh  Google parent Alphabet Inc and e-commerce giant Amazon.com Inc capped a blockbuster June quarter for the five biggest U.S. tech companies as their dominance in key markets helped them defy the ""law of large numbers"".Apple Inc, Microsoft Corp and Facebook Inc, as well as Alphabet and Amazon, all blew past Wall Street expectations for both profit and revenue.""The results are further indications that the leaders in their respective spaces are taking market shares and it is very much a microcosm of the internet as a whole,"" Benchmark Company analyst Daniel Kurnos told Reuters.At some point, Kurnos said, the fact that the companies have grown so large will catch up with them.""But I think people still continue to underestimate how large the addressable opportunity is,"" he said.Alphabet's Class A shares rose 4.9 percent in early trading on Friday, boosting the company's market value by about $23 billion to $542 billion. Amazon rose 1.8 percent, pushing up its market capitalization by about $6 billion to around $361 billion.Together, the five companies would add about $346 billion to their combined value - roughly the gross domestic product of Egypt - if they were to trade at analysts' median price targets.Alphabet - which competes with all of the other four companies in either advertising, cloud computing, or operating systems - showed that efforts to push its vast ad business toward mobile were paying off, calming fears that the company's best days were behind it.""How many other almost $100 billion revenue companies are accelerating growth rates to their strongest level in years?,""  Macquarie analyst Ben Schachter said in a research note.Ad revenue from its Google business, which accounts for 89 percent of total revenue, jumped 19.5 percent to $19.14 billion. Google also houses the company's Android business that competes with iOS from Apple, which sold more iPhones than analysts expected in the latest quarter.Alphabet's ad sales numbers, and the stellar ad revenue growth that Facebook reported on Wednesday, underscored the shift in ad dollars to mobile devices from television.The leading social media company's wildly popular mobile app and push into video attracted new advertisers and encouraged existing ones to spend more.SMOKIN'  While Google still controls nearly a third of the roughly $187 billion global digital-ad market, Facebook's share has risen to 12 percent so far this year, from 8.6 percent in 2014, according to market research firm eMarketer.Alphabet's other businesses, including cloud, through which it competes with Microsoft and Amazon, also held their own.""Alphabet smoked Q2 expectations, including revenue upside and a further exhibition of its new passion for expense control,"" Pacific Crest analyst Evan Wilson said in a note.Wilson, who has an ""overweight"" rating on the company's stock, raised his price target to $960 from $910.Of 50 analysts covering the company, 19 raised their price targets on Alphabet's class A stock, which has a median price target of $907.Goldman Sachs was the most bullish, raising its target by $120 to $930. All but three of the brokerages covering the stock rate it ""buy"" or above. None has a sell. Alphabet's non-ad revenue jumped 33 percent to $2.17 billion, largely driven by cloud. While the pace of growth in Amazon's cloud business slowed, revenue jumped 58 percent to $2.9 billion.Microsoft's revenue in what it calls its ""intelligent cloud"" businesses, which includes the Azure cloud platform and server software, rose 7 percent to $6.7 billion.Amazon remains the undisputed leader in cloud computing, although Microsoft, under Satya Nadella, and Alphabet are both nipping at its heels.Amazon's global retail sales also beat estimates in the quarter.""The long-term growth outlook is upbeat, as Amazon slowly takes away traditional retail's last competitive advantage - instant gratification - and rides the AWS cloud secular growth theme,"" said Gene Munster, an analyst at Piper Jaffray.Munster, who raised his price target on Amazon by $100 to $900, has an ""overweight"" rating on the stock.Nineteen analysts raised their price targets on Amazon, which has a median price target of $850. Raymond James, the most bullish, raised its target by $130 to $900.Of 45 analysts covering the company, 41 rate it a ""buy"" or above. The other four rate it a ""hold"".

912,"  SAN FRANCISCO Facebook Inc is to let small businesses in emerging markets sell to customers for free through their Facebook pages, the social media company said on Wednesday, marking a new effort to build up potential advertisers in its fastest-growing regions.The move is Facebook's latest foray onto online commerce in emerging markets. The company launched a service last year allowing some merchants to sell items through paid ads on Facebook's app. The latest service will instead be free, and users can view products through merchants' own Facebook pages. By making sellers more reliant on Facebook, the company hopes that more businesses in emerging markets will eventually decide to become paying advertisers. ""If a business is seeing value from their page, there is a higher opportunity that they could be an advertiser,"" said Benji Shomair, product marketing director of Facebook Pages, in an interview. Facebook, whose stock hit its all-time high last week after reporting sharp growth in ad sales, has about 3 million active advertisers. But there are more than 60 million businesses worldwide using its service that can set up pages for free in an attempt to reach more customers out of Facebook's 1.7 billion global monthly users. Southeast Asia is Facebook's fastest-growing region for users, but it still makes far more money off users in the United States and Canada. The company made average revenue of $13.74 per North American user in the second quarter, compared with an average of $1.74 per user in the Asia-Pacific region.The hugely popular Facebook app and website has largely saturated Western markets and is turning to emerging markets for growth, both in users and advertising dollars.  It has launched Free Basics, a free, pared-down version of the internet, in more than 30 countries that have populations without reliable internet connections, and it is building internet-beaming drones to connect people who have never had access to the internet. Both initiatives are central to Facebook's global strategy of seeking to reach a large group of potential users who otherwise would not be able to create Facebook accounts.

913,"   By Deborah M. Todd | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Apple Inc on Wednesday reported improvements in gender and ethnic diversity in June as the U.S. technology company stayed ahead of fellow Silicon Valley power houses Google  and Facebook Inc  in hiring minorities.Apple also said in its annual diversity and inclusion report that it had closed pay gaps over the last year by analyzing salaries, bonuses and annual stock grants. It had also opened up its annual stock grants program to retail employees for the first time.As of June, Apple's overall U.S. workforce was 56 percent white (up 2 percent from a year ago), 19 percent Asian (down 1 percent) 12 percent Hispanic (up 1 percent), and 9 percent black (up 1 percent). Apple's workforce includes a pool of retail employees that Google and Facebook do not have. In Apple stores, blacks and Hispanics respectively comprised 12 percent and 17 percent of general employees, and 5 percent and 10 percent of the leadership. At Alphabet Inc's Google unit, blacks and Hispanics respectively made up 2 and 3 percent of the overall workforce and 1 and 3 percent of its tech employees, little changed from last year. At Facebook, blacks and Hispanics were respectively 2 and 4 percent of the workforce and 1 and 3 percent of tech employees. Apple's global workforce was 32 percent women, up 1 percent from the end of June 2015. Women held 23 percent of technical positions, up 1 percent from a year ago, and 28 percent of leadership positions, unchanged from June last year.    Reverend Jesse Jackson, who confronted Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook in 2014 about the company's lack of diversity and unfair compensation, applauded its efforts to connect with engineers of color through partnerships with historically black colleges and universities and scholarship organizations.""They are clearly setting the pace, making measurable progress for three consecutive years. They've acted with intention, not just aspiration,"" Jackson said in a statement. Amazon Inc, which employs a large number of workers at distribution centers, reported late last year that its ethnic diversity exceeded the U.S. average, with a global workforce that was 21 percent black, 13 percent Hispanic, 11 percent Asian and 5 percent other ethnicities.In management positions at Amazon, however, representation dropped to 4 percent for blacks and Hispanics, 3 percent for other races, and climbed to 20 percent for Asians.

919,"   By Jessica DiNapoli | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Univision Holdings Inc won a bankruptcy auction on Tuesday to acquire U.S. internet publisher Gawker Media LLC for $135 million, outbidding media company Ziff Davis LLC, which had made an initial offer of $90 million.Univision's winning bid for Gawker, which will go before a U.S. bankruptcy judge on Thursday, shows how the U.S. Spanish-language broadcaster is seeking to expand its digital media properties and is not shying away from a news brand that has often courted controversy to build a cult readership. Univision was the only challenger to Ziff Davis, whose stalking horse bid had set the floor for others in the auction. An investment banker representing Gawker said in court last month that he had a list of 40 potential buyers he planned to market the company to. Gawker founder Nick Denton said in a prepared statement that the company ""could not have picked an acquirer more devoted to vibrant journalism."" ""I am pleased that our employees are protected and will continue their work under new ownership - disentangled from the legal campaign against the company,"" he said.  Ziff Davis decided to withdraw once it ""felt the price and terms exceeded [its] threshold,"" according to an internal memo from Chief Executive Vivek Shah. Univision offered no immediate comment. Gawker sought bankruptcy in June after facing a $140 million court judgment following an invasion of privacy lawsuit from former professional wrestler Hulk Hogan over the publication of excerpts from a sex tape. Denton filed for personal bankruptcy this month to also seek protection from the judgment. Ziff Davis had agreed to bring him on as a consultant were it to have bought Gawker. Denton's future at Gawker with Univision as the owner is now uncertain.Hogan's lawsuit was bankrolled by billionaire investor Peter Thiel, an early backer of Facebook Inc and a co-founder of PayPal. Gawker in 2007 had published an article about Thiel's homosexuality.      Bids for Gawker, which also includes popular women's website Jezebel, sports site Deadspin and automobile enthusiast site Jalopnik, were due on Monday.INFLUENTIAL FORCES  Gawker and Denton were influential forces in the growth of online media, developing a direct, conversational and sometimes-slashing style that dispensed with many journalistic conventions and was widely imitated. Its eagerness to dish salacious gossip was often condemned, but it was also one of the few early digital publishers to build a profitable independent business.Univision owns a Spanish-language broadcast network that sometimes beats English language U.S. broadcasters such as NBC in the primetime ratings race. It also owns another broadcast channel called UniMas, as well as several cable networks and a stable of Spanish radio stations.Univision, like many other media companies, has been aggressively courting millennial audiences. In 2013, it launched English-language TV network and website Fusion with Disney to target millennials across cultures, and earlier this year it acquired a minority stake in satirical web publisher Onion Inc.

INFLUENTIAL FORCES Gawker and Denton were influential forces in the growth of online media, developing a direct, conversational and sometimes-slashing style that dispensed with many journalistic conventions and was widely imitated.Its eagerness to dish salacious gossip was often condemned, but it was also one of the few early digital publishers to build a profitable independent business.Univision owns a Spanish-language broadcast network that sometimes beats English language U.S. broadcasters such as NBC in the primetime ratings race. It also owns another broadcast channel called UniMas, as well as several cable networks and a stable of Spanish radio stations.Univision, like many other media companies, has been aggressively courting millennial audiences. In 2013, it launched English-language TV network and website Fusion with Disney to target millennials across cultures, and earlier this year it acquired a minority stake in satirical web publisher Onion Inc.

924,"   By Narottam Medhora  Popular messaging service WhatsApp said it would start sharing users' phone numbers with parent Facebook Inc (FB.O), marking a notable shift in its stance on privacy.When Facebook bought WhatsApp in 2014, founder Jan Koum vowed to protect data of its users, saying the deal would not affect its privacy policy.The change in policy, WhatsApp's first since the deal, will allow for more relevant advertisements and friend recommendations on Facebook, according to a WhatsApp blog post.WhatsApp, however, sought to reassure users by saying that it would not sell, share, or give users' phone numbers to advertisers.The company also maintained that messages on the service were encrypted by default and that it would not allow banner advertisements from third parties. ""Our belief in the value of private communications is unshakeable,"" WhatsApp said in the post.Koum had outlined his approach to privacy in a blog post after the deal with Facebook, drawing on his own experiences of growing up in Ukraine during the Soviet era.Some users, however, were not convinced by the shift in WhatsApp's stance. ""Phone numbers?!? No! That's absolutely NOT OKAY. I might need to delete Facebook, people. NOT kidding,"" Twitter user Mindy McAdams wrote.WhatsApp said users could choose not to share account information with Facebook. (bit.ly/2biXHVy) The shared data will also help WhatsApp track information about how often people use its services and tackle spam on the service, it said on Thursday.WhatsApp, which is has more than 1 billion users, will also explore ways for businesses to send messages using its platform over the next several months, it said.

925,"   By Yasmeen Abutaleb | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Facebook Inc (FB.O) changed its popular ""Trending"" feature, which shows users the most-talked about topics of the day, to make it more automated and further eliminate the potential for human bias, the company wrote in a blog post on Friday. The update is Facebook's latest attempt in recent months to stress its neutrality as its influence grows. The feature came under scrutiny in May after a news report alleged it suppressed conservative news, which prompted a demand from Republican members of the U.S. Congress for more transparency. Facebook said an internal probe found no evidence of bias.  The Trending feature shows users the most-talked about stories and topics on the top right-hand corner of Facebook's home page with one-sentence descriptions. To eliminate the potential for bias, Facebook said it would no longer rely on editors to write descriptions for the topics and would instead show users the topic and how many people are discussing it. Facebook said in an e-mailed statement that the composition of its Trending team would focus more on technical expertise since it no longer needed editors to write descriptions. The company did not say whether it was laying off employees. Facebook maintains it is a neutral platform, but its political influence has come under scrutiny, especially as its user base swells. It has 1.7 billion people on its social network, and studies have shown it has the power to influence people's behavior, ranging from registering as organ donors to registering to vote.  After the May news report first surfaced, Facebook penned a lengthy blog post explaining how the Trending feature works, the first time it had done so. Less than two weeks later, the company said it changed some procedures and outlined those changes in an effort to be more transparent.

937,"  FRANKFURT German prosecutors are again considering whether to press charges against Mark Zuckerberg and other Facebook executives for failing to staunch a tide of racist and threatening posts on the social network during an influx of migrants into Europe. Munich prosecutors said they had received a complaint filed by a German technology law firm two weeks ago alleging that Facebook (FB.O) broke strict national laws against hate speech, sedition and support for terrorist organizations.Attorney Chan-jo Jun, who filed a similar complaint in Hamburg a year ago, is demanding that Facebook executives be compelled to comply with anti-hate speech laws by removing racist or violent postings from their site. Jun is principal partner of the law firm Jun Lawyers of Wuerzburg in Bavaria. Facebook said the complaint had no merit. ""Mr Jun's complaints have repeatedly been rejected and there is no merit to this (latest) one either,"" a Facebook spokeswoman said. ""There is no place for hate on Facebook. Rather than focusing on these claims we work with partners to fight hate speech and foster counter speech."" Facebook's rules forbid bullying, harassment and threatening language, but critics say it does not do enough to enforce them.A spokeswoman for the public prosecutor in Munich said a decision would be taken in coming weeks on whether to act on the new complaint, which names Zuckerberg - Facebook's founder and chief executive - and regional European and German managers.Hamburg prosecutors denied Jun's earlier complaint on grounds that the regional court lacked jurisdiction because Facebook's European operations are based in Ireland. Jun wrote on his website he believed he would get a more favorable hearing in Bavaria because the justice ministry had signaled an openness to hearing racial hate crime cases.  Jun has compiled a list of 438 postings over the past year that include what some might consider merely angry political rantings, but also show clear examples of racist hate speech and calls to violence laced with references to Nazi-era genocide. Following a public outcry and pressure by German politicians for failing to delete a rash of racist postings on Facebook, the Silicon Valley social networking giant earlier this year hired Arvato, a business services unit of Bertelsmann (BTGGg.F), to monitor and delete racist posts (reut.rs/1WfylHe).A rash of online abuse and violent attacks against newcomers to Germany occurred amid a migrant influx last year, which led to a rise in the popularity of the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) party and has put pressure on Chancellor Angela Merkel and her Christian Democratic party.

945,"   By Tom Bergin | LONDON  LONDON Facebook said its main UK subsidiary generated an 11-million-pound tax credit in 2015 even as revenues soared, thanks to its tax efficient structure, accounts published on the weekend showed.Analysts say Facebook generates hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue from UK clients each year but until this year all transactions were booked in Ireland, minimizing the social media group's UK tax bill.Facebook UK Ltd is funded by affiliates such as the main Irish unit. It received over 210 million pounds ($261.14 million) in 2015 from these affiliates. But that wasn't enough to cover its costs and the UK subsidiary reported a loss of 52 million pounds. A spokeswoman said Facebook paid all the taxes it was required to under UK law.“We are proud that in 2015 we have continued to grow our business in the UK and created over 300 new high skilled jobs,” she added. UK politicians, spurred by public anger about corporate tax avoidance, have criticized the tax arrangements of Facebook and other U.S. tech giants in recent years. The companies exploit loopholes in U.S. and international tax rules to pay almost no tax on non-U.S. profits.Last year, the UK government introduced a new tax to target structures like Facebook’s. In March, Facebook said it would begin to report some UK revenues in Britain from 2016, although it’s unclear what impact, if any, this change will have on its tax bill. Facebook's UK loss was swelled by charges for share incentive schemes, which have not yet vested.Facebook won’t get the benefit of the tax deduction until this happens, which means the company may still have to pay tax for 2015. Excluding the deduction for share schemes, Facebook would have a tax bill of 4 million pounds for last year.However, the spokeswoman declined to say if Facebook had paid any tax in respect of 2015.

954,"   By Dustin Volz and Supantha Mukherjee  Twitter Inc said Thursday it would cut 9 percent of its global workforce to keep costs down even as quarterly results eclipsed Wall Street's beaten-down expectations, lifting shares that had fallen after a failed effort to sell the company.More than 300 Twitter employees will be affected by the layoffs as part of a broader restructuring, a figure similar to an earlier round of reductions announced a year ago. Separately, the company announced it would discontinue Vine, a video app launched in 2013 that played brief clips on a repeat loop that struggled to compete with Facebook's Instagram.The reductions of staff and services were blunted somewhat by the backdrop of third-quarter revenue growth that slowed sharply but topped analysts' expectations. Its stock was up 1.6 percent to $17.56, after rallying 5 percent in premarket trading.Revenue rose about 8 percent to $616 million, above the average analyst estimate of $605.8 million. The company had reported a 20-percent rise in revenue in the previous quarter and 58 percent in the year-ago quarter. Twitter, which has seen user growth stall amid competition from nimbler rivals such as Instagram and Snapchat, said its user base ticked up 3 percent to 317 million average monthly active users in the quarter. Analysts, on average, had expected 316.3 million monthly active users, according to market research firm FactSet StreetAccount.""The building blocks for revenue are increasing the number of users, and Twitter is not doing a particularly good job of that,"" Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter said. He added that Twitter needed to grow revenue by $200 million to $300 million a quarter to achieve 2017 profitability.""The run-rate for the year is under $100 million in profit, so it is really hard to justify spending $15 or $18 billion to buy a $100-million profit (company),"" Pachter said.Total advertising revenue of $545 million grew 6 percent year-over-year, and 90 percent of it came from mobile. Excluding items, the company earned 13 cents per share, beating the average estimate of 9 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.The company is ""more disciplined about how we invest in the business"" and intends to be profitable in 2017, said Chief Financial Officer Anthony Noto. Among its priorities, Twitter is dedicated to growing its burgeoning live video offerings through partnerships with organizations such as the National Football League, Noto said. Advertisers are increasingly interested in live video because of its potential to reach new and younger audiences, he added.Twitter hired bankers last month to field acquisition offers, but it has seen a dearth of potential bidders. Salesforce.com Inc, the last of a small cohort of companies including Walt Disney Co and Alphabet Inc believed to have been interested, said recently it would not pursue a deal. The apparent lack of interest forced the social media company to consider a route anathema to aspiring tech startups: a major restructuring.MORE LAYOFFS Twitter had 3,860 employees globally as of June. The reduction of more than 300, chiefly in its sales, partnerships, and marketing efforts.The cuts come about a year after a similar wave of layoffs of up to 336 employees were announced when Jack Dorsey, its co-founder who had been serving as interim chief executive, took over as permanent CEO. Since then, Dorsey has drawn criticism from some analysts for splitting his time between Twitter and Square.  The company said it expected cash expenditures of about $10 million to $20 million in the fourth quarter, mostly for severance costs.On an investor call Thursday, Dorsey said he would not comment on speculation about a potential sale. He said in a statement that the company has ""a clear plan, and we’re making the necessary changes to ensure Twitter is positioned for long-term growth.”Asked by investors whether major events such as presidential debates or the Olympics affected Twitter's quarterly growth in metrics, Noto said there needed to be such an event ""every day"" on the platform to meaningfully improve numbers, and ""that's where we're headed.""The popular but money-losing microblogging service spent aggressively on product development and marketing in recent years, betting it could afford losses as long as it attracted new users. But that growth stalled this year after it exceeded 300 million active monthly users, less than a fifth of Facebook Inc's users and below Facebook's Instagram.  The company's net loss narrowed to $102.9 million, or 15 cents per share, in the third quarter, from $131.7 million, or 20 cents per share, a year earlier.Twitter also said it would roll out “meaningful updates” next month affecting how it protects users from abusive content, an issue for which the company has endured growing criticism.

958,"  (Repeating for additional clients with no changes to text)By Kristina Cooke, Dan Levine and Dustin VolzSAN FRANCISCO/WASHINGTON Oct 28 After Facebook's removal of an iconic Vietnam war photo stirred an international uproar last month, the social network's executives quickly backtracked and cleared its publication.But the image - showing a naked Vietnamese girl burned by napalm - had previously been used in training sessions as an example of a post that should be removed, two former Facebook employees told Reuters.Trainers told content-monitoring staffers that the photo violated Facebook policy, despite its historical significance, because it depicted a naked child, in distress, photographed without her consent, the employees told Reuters.The social network has taken great pains to craft rules that can be applied uniformly with minimal discretion. The reversal on the war photo, however, shows how Facebook's top executives sometimes overrule company policy and its legions of low- and mid-level content monitors.Facebook has often insisted that it is a technology company - not a media company - but an elite group of at least five senior executives regularly directs content policy and makes editorial judgment calls, particularly in high-profile controversies, eight current and former Facebook executives told Reuters.One of those key decision-makers - Justin Osofsky, who runs the community operations division - wrote a Facebook post acknowledging that the removal of the war photo was a ""mistake.""""Sometimes,"" he wrote, ""the global and historical significance of a photo like 'Terror of War' outweighs the importance of keeping nudity off Facebook.""Facebook spokeswoman Christine Chen declined to comment on the company's use of the photo in training sessions.Facebook has long resisted calls to publicly detail its policies and practices on censoring postings. That approach has drawn criticism from users who have had content removed and free-speech advocates, who cite a lack of transparency and a lack of an appeals process for many content decisions.At the same time, some governments and anti-terror groups are pressuring the company to remove more posts they consider offensive or dangerous.HIGH-LEVEL REVIEW The current and former Facebook executives, most of them speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters in detail how complaints move through the company's content-policing apparatus. The toughest calls, they said, rise to an elite group of executives.Another of the key decision-makers is Global Policy Chief Monika Bickert, who helped rule on the fracas over the war photo.""That was one we took a hard look at, and we decided it definitely belonged on the site,"" said Bickert, a former federal prosecutor.She declined to elaborate on the decision-making process. Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg followed up with an apology to Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg, who had posted the photo on her own account after Facebook removed it from others in her country.In addition to Sandberg, Osofsky and Bickert, executives involved in sensitive content issues include Joel Kaplan, Facebook's Washington-based government relations chief; and Elliot Schrage, the vice president for public policy and communications.All five studied at Harvard, and four of them have both undergraduate and graduate degrees from the elite institution. All but Sandberg hold law degrees. Three of the executives have longstanding personal ties to Sandberg.Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg, a Harvard drop-out, occasionally gets involved with content controversies, Bickert said.These executives also weigh in on content policy changes meant to reflect shifting social context and political sensitivities around the world, current and former executives said.Facebook officials said the five people identified by Reuters were not the only ones involved in high-level content decisions.""Facebook has a broad, diverse and global network involved in content policy and enforcement, with different managers and senior executives being pulled in depending on the region and the issue at hand,"" Chen said.Chen declined to name any other executives who were involved in content policy. A WAR OVER FREE EXPRESSION The company's reticence to explain censorship decisions has drawn criticism in many countries around the globe.Last month, Facebook disabled the accounts of editors at two of the most widely read Palestinian online publications, Shehab News Agency and Quds. In keeping with standard company practice, Facebook didn't publicly offer a reason for the action or pinpoint any content it considered inappropriate.The company told Reuters that the removal was simply an error.Some Palestinian advocacy groups and media outlets condemned the shutdowns as censorship stemming from what they described as Facebook's improper alliance with the Israeli government.Israel's government has pushed Facebook to block hundreds of pages it believes incite violence against Jews, said Noam Sela, spokesman for Israeli cabinet Minister Gilad Erdan.Sela said the Israeli government ""had a connection"" at Facebook to handle complaints but declined to elaborate on the relationship.""It's not working as well as we would like,"" Sela said. ""We have more work to do to get Facebook to remove these pages.""Ezz al-Din al-Akhras, a Quds supervisor, said that Facebook's head of policy in the Middle East had gotten in touch after the uproar over the shutdowns and that three of four suspended accounts were restored. ""We hope the Facebook campaign of suspending and removing Palestinian accounts will stop,"" he said. ""We do not practice incitement; we are only conveying news from Palestine to the world.""Facebook said the restoration of the accounts was not a response to complaints. It declined to comment on whether top executives were involved.The company has cited technological glitches in other recent cases where content was removed, then restored, including the takedown of a video that showed the aftermath of a Minneapolis police shooting.Chen declined to explain the glitch.She said the company was reviewing its appeals process in response to public feedback. Facebook currently allows appeals of company actions involving entire profiles set up by people or institutions, or full pages on those profiles, but not for individual posts.THICK RULEBOOK To manage the huge volume of content complaints - more than a million a day - the company employs a multi-layered system. It starts with automated routing of complaints to content-policing teams in Dublin, Hyderabad, Austin and Menlo Park, who make initial rulings, current and former executives said.These low-level staffers and contractors consult a thick rulebook that interprets the comparatively spare ""community standards"" that Facebook customers are asked to follow. The company trains front-line monitors to follow rules and use as little discretion as possible.When a removal sparks more complaints, regional managers function as a mid-level appeals court. Continuing controversy could then push the issue to top U.S. executives.Senior executives also weigh in on policy updates. Osofsky and Kaplan, for instance, wrote a blog post last week, in response to ""continued feedback"" on content removals, explaining that the company would start weighing news value more heavily in deciding whether to block content.In an earlier post, responding to the Napalm-girl controversy, Osofsky said Facebook's policies usually work well, but not always.""In many cases, there's no clear line between an image of nudity or violence that carries global and historic significance and one that doesn't,"" Osofsky wrote.The Vietnam war photo - depicting horrors suffered by a girl named Phan Thi Kim Phuc - was first removed from an account in Norway by a front-line monitor.In protest, the Norwegian newspaper Aftenposten printed the image on its front page and posted it on Facebook, which removed it. That prompted the prime minister to post the photo - only to have Facebook remove it again.Facebook then issued a statement defending the action, saying it was ""difficult to create a distinction between allowing a photograph of a nude child in one instance and not others.""The next day, executives reversed the call, with Sandberg telling the prime minister: ""Even with clear standards, screening millions of posts on a case-by-case basis every week is challenging.""

We have improved our escalation process to ensure that controversial stories and images get surfaced more quickly,"" said Patrick Walker, Facebook's director of media partnership for Europe, Middle East and Africa.""(And) in the weeks ahead, we are going to begin allowing more items that people find newsworthy, significant or important to the public interest, even if they might otherwise violate our standards,"" Walker told a meeting of the Association of Norwegian Editors in Oslo, to which he was invited following the row.

Reuters reported on Friday that an elite group of at least five senior executives, including chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg, regularly directs content policy and makes editorial judgment calls, particularly in high-profile controversies. To the audience of journalists, the Facebook executive said the company had to have global standards of content as it was mindful that content, such as nudity, that was acceptable in one country may not be acceptable in another.Many were left unconvinced after the debate.""Facebook is trying to isolate this as a question of rules about nudity, about being careful.

967,"   By Yimou Lee and Antoni Slodkowski | YANGON  YANGON Norwegian telecoms company Telenor will focus on improving data services in Myanmar, the head of the local business said on Wednesday, as an era of rapid subscriber growth following the opening up of the economy has ended. The liberalization of Myanmar's telecoms sector has been a rare example of successful reform since the military ceded power in 2011, with Telenor quickly establishing itself as the No. 2 in the market with 18 million subscribers.But after a period of astonishing growth in a country which had one of the world's lowest mobile penetration rates, the fight over customers is shifting to more-lucrative Internet services, fueled by Myanmar's near-ubiquitous use of Facebook.""Those who wanted to have a SIM card already have one ... The fight will turn into existing customers rather than new, virgin customers who have never had experiences in cellphones,"" Telenor Myanmar chief executive, Lars Erik Tellmann, told Reuters in an interview.""Everyone has jumped into mobile – there's no fixed line alternatives and very few have PCs while Internet penetration remains extremely low,"" said Tellmann. ""That explains why everyone is so hungry for their smartphone and their ability to be online.""Other social media apps popular in Myanmar include Facebook-owned WhatsApp and Viber. Telenor faces tough competition from Myanmar Posts and Telecommunications (MPT), a state-owned provider that has partnered with Japan's KDDI Corp to improve its services, and Qatar's Ooredoo. Estimates vary, but industry experts say MPT has around 21 million subscribers while Ooredoo has reported 9 million. Vietnamese carrier Viettel said in April it planned to form a consortium with two Myanmar companies to invest a combined $1.5 billion in Myanmar's telecoms sector if it won the country's fourth, and last, telecom license. Myanmar accounted for 5.3 percent of Telenor's revenue in the third quarter and was its fastest growing market. But the company's average revenue per user in Myanmar, a key industry measure, was down 28 percent to $4 compared with a year earlier, partly because Telenor is now pushing deeper into rural areas where people spend less on mobile services.""Super hyper growth has flattened,"" said Tellmann.  As of the third quarter, around 40 percent of Telenor's revenue in Myanmar came from data services, Tellmann said, while the remaining 60 percent was from the traditional sources such as voice calls and text messages.The company has built 6,800 telecoms towers and plans to build an additional 3,200 by the end of 2018.""The leftover rollout we have is going to be the most challenging and difficult,"" said Tellmann, referring to areas controlled by the country's myriad of ethnic armed groups and where fighting still goes on unabated.

Ad loads are the number of ads that can be displayed to customers without alienating them. The issue is particularly important for Facebook since 90 percent of its users access the social network through mobile devices.Facebook said aggressive investment would continue in 2017.""Clearly the market is spooked by FB's 2017 commentary, but there was nothing new and certainly not anything that the market didn't eventually expect to hear,"" Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Shyam Patil said in a client note.Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster, who reiterated his ""overweight"" rating, said Facebook was making the right investments, ""which should pay off in spades during 2018+."" Of 49 brokerages covering Facebook, 45 have a ""buy"" or higher rating on the stock.Facebook had said after its second-quarter results that it expected lower ad revenue growth rates in each successive quarter in 2016 as ad load would grow only modestly.Facebook has beaten revenue estimates for all three quarters this year, propelled by strong ad sales growth.""There's no doubt the business is performing much better than expected ... and we think FB is just trying to keep expectations in check as we head into 2017,"" Patil said. Up to Wednesday's close, Facebook's shares had risen more than 21 percent since the start of the year.That has made the stock pricey.Facebook's stock trades at nearly 34 times forward 12-month earnings, compared with Google-parent Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O),  23 times and Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) 13.5.Google, whose advertising revenue increased 18 percent in the quarter, is Facebook's chief rival for ad dollars.""There are several consumer and ad innovations that should keep advertiser demand high (for Facebook),"" said Canaccord Genuity analyst Michael Graham.""We believe Facebook's operating momentum, high growth and reasonable valuation continue to suggest it should be a core tech holding.""

981,"  RABAT Nov 4 Morocco has lifted a ban on calls made through mobile internet connections, its national telecoms regulator said, acting after fierce protests on social media against a rule introduced at the start of the year.The ban was applied to the three mobile operators in Morocco who offer internet access for computers via USB and other mobile modems, as well as via mobile phones.The Telecommunications Regulatory National Agency (ANRT) had said telecom services such as phone calls need licences whether they are Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) or others.""The decision (to lift the ban) comes after the ANRT's evaluation of the telecom national and international markets, the legal context and taking into consideration the requirements to develop a sector that benefits customers,"" the regulator said in a statement on Friday. The ban affected the two most-used applications in Morocco Skype and WhatsApp, along with Facebook and Viber and other providers of VoIP services.Morocco's telecoms market is dominated by Maroc Telecom , majority owned by the UAE's Etisalat, French group Orange's local affiliate Medi Telecom (Meditel) and Wana Corporate, a subsidiary of the royal holding SNI. Lifting the ban came as the kingdom prepares to host the 2016 United Nations climate change conference and only few days after the head of ANRT was sacked. ANRT had tolerated internet voice calls for years but the drop in call volumes, mainly lucrative international calls, may have motivated the decision.Protests erupted on social media when the ban came into force in January, with local media speculating whether security controls were behind the move.Mobile phone market penetration is running at around 140 percent of Morocco's 34 million population, and the country had 10 million Internet subscribers by the end in 2015, up more than 60 percent from 2013.

So far, the companies have not agreed. ""We think consumers deserve a greater level of information and protection, but so far Facebook hasn't agreed,"" Denham said.A Facebook spokeswoman said WhatsApp ""designed its privacy policy and terms update to give users a clear and simple explanation of how the service works, as well as choice over how their data is used.""These updates comply with applicable law, and follow the latest guidance from the UK Information Commissioner's Office.

992,"   By Tim Baysinger  Twitter Inc  said it was able to deliver more viewers than promised to advertisers on a U.S. election night livestream, good news for the microblogging site as it tries to ward off growing competition for ad dollars from Snapchat and Instagram.  Twitter partnered with BuzzFeed to host an election night broadcast on Tuesday and attracted major advertisers, including Paramount Pictures, Amazon.com Inc’s  “Man in the High Castle,” Activision Blizzard Inc’s “Call of Duty,” Johnnie Walker and Izod.    San Francisco-based Twitter declined to say how much it charged brands to be included in the livestream, but said by email that it overdelivered between two to three times on its live ad impressions that were guaranteed. Video from advertisers fetches higher rates than text and photo-based ads and is seen as key revenue source for Twitter. Snapchat has been building up its ad sales team ahead of next year's IPO and Instagram will take a larger role in growing Facebook Inc's ad revenue.At least one of the advertisers, PVH Corp’s Izod, is eager to work with Twitter more in the future. Izod ran a 60-second video featuring presidential debate sensation Ken Bone in his trademark red Izod sweater.“We’re going to look long and hard about increasing our presence there,” said Mike Kelly, executive vice president of the Marketing Group, PVH’s in-house agency. “We walked away a bit changed in our point of view.”    Twitter handled the ad sales, and split half the revenue with BuzzFeed, according to a source familiar with the situation who spoke on condition of anonymity. The BuzzFeed broadcast began around 6 p.m. (2300 GMT) and ended sometime after midnight (0500 GMT), and was watched by a total of 6.8 million unique viewers. The average minute audience, the best metric to use when comparing to a TV audience, was 165,000 viewers globally. By comparison, Fox News drew an average minute audience of 12.2 million.    The overperformance for advertisers came at a much-needed time for Twitter, which has staked its future on video. The company has made a point of getting advertisers to move toward video buys as a way of stemming its declining ad revenue growth.On Wednesday, Chief Operating Officer Adam Bain, a key figure in building Twitter's ad business, announced he was leaving the company in what was seen as a big blow. Chief Financial Officer Anthony Noto, who attended BuzzFeed's election night broadcast in New York, will replace Bain while still holding his current title until the company finds a new CFO.    Hosting BuzzFeed’s stream was seen as a bit of an upset for Twitter, as most had expected BuzzFeed to work with Facebook instead. Unlike Facebook Live, Twitter’s video strategy more closely mimics what viewers see on television.The company has signed deals with numerous U.S. professional and college sports leagues, most notably with the National Football League, in an effort to both increase its stalled user base and court larger advertisers that have traditionally worked with television, but are looking to reach consumers who are not subscribed to a cable TV package.Shares of Twitter closed up nearly 1 percent at $18.55 on the New York Stock Exchange.

994,"   By Dustin Volz  Facebook Inc said on Friday it would no longer allow certain advertisers to exclude racial or ethnic groups when placing ads on its service, following criticism that the practice was discriminatory.The move comes amid growing scrutiny of how the world's largest online social media network's policies and algorithms shape what content appears in a user's news feed. The unexpected victory of Donald Trump in the U.S. presidential election this week has prompted questions over how much voters were swayed by inaccurate or misleading news items shared on Facebook, mostly in favor of Trump.Facebook will disable use of the advertising tool, called 'ethnic affinities,' for ads that offer housing, employment and the extension of credit; areas where certain groups have historically faced discrimination, Facebook said in a blog post. ""There are many non-discriminatory uses of our ethnic affinity solution in these areas, but we have decided that we can best guard against discrimination by suspending these types of ads,"" Erin Egan, Facebook's chief privacy officer, wrote. (bit.ly/2eZ8Eey) Facebook collects vast amounts of data on its users, including photographs, allowing it to demographically categorize them in ways that allow advertisers to precisely target content to those they want to reach.The company said it will now use tools that automatically detect and disable ads offering housing, employment or credit that rely on ethnic affinity marketing, Egan said. It will also update its policies to more explicitly require advertisers to not engage in discriminatory advertising.The changes come two weeks after ProPublica, a non-profit investigative news organization, published an article showing how Facebook allowed advertisers to exclude groups on the basis of ethnic affinities, a practice it said may violate federal housing and civil rights laws passed in the 1960s. A group of Facebook users filed a lawsuit against the company after the ProPublica report, claiming such ad targeting violated the Fair Housing Act and Civil Rights Act. Facebook has attracted criticism in recent months for how it polices several forms of content for its 1.8 billion users, including extremist propaganda, nudity and misleading or inaccurate political articles, which have become known as 'fake news.' The company has been accused by some reporters, political observers and some in Silicon Valley of helping Trump win Tuesday's election by doing little to limit the spread of such items, many from dubious websites, on its service.On Thursday, Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg rejected those claims. I think the idea that fake news on Facebook, (which is) a very small amount of the content, influenced the election in any way, is a pretty crazy idea,"" he said at a technology conference in California.

1003,"   By Joseph Menn | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO One of the world’s most popular means of communication, Facebook's (FB.O) WhatsApp, is adding fully encrypted video calling to its messaging app on Monday, a move that comes as privacy advocates worry about the potential for stepped-up government surveillance under a Trump administration. WhatsApp, which boasts more than a billion users worldwide,  adopted end-to-end encryption early this year, making it technically impossible for the company or government authorities to read messages or listen to calls. The new video calling service will thus provide another means for people to communicate without fear of eavesdropping though WhatsApp does retain other data such as an individual's  list of contacts. WhatsApp co-founder Jan Koum said in an interview that video calls will be rolled out to 180 countries within hours after the feature is introduced at an event in India. “We obviously try to be in tune with what our users want,” Koum said at the company’s unmarked Mountain View, California headquarters building. “We’re obsessed with making sure that voice and video work well even on low-end phones.”Koum told Reuters that improvements in phone cameras, battery life and bandwidth had made the service viable for a significant proportion of WhatsApp users, even those using inexpensive smartphones.Apple Inc (AAPL.O) offers its FaceTime video calls to iPhone users, and Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) Skype offers video calls  on multiple platforms. But WhatsApp has built a massive installed base of mobile customers and has been steadily adding more features to what began as a simple chat applications. PRICE OF ALLEGIANCE WhatsApp has operated with some autonomy since Facebook bought it in 2014. Koum and co-founder Brian Acton, longtime Yahoo (YHOO.O) engineers who started the company in 2009, now have 200 staff, mostly engineers and customer support, up from 50 when Facebook bought it.Koum said Facebook has allowed WhatsApp to use its servers and bandwidth around the world for voice and now video. That support will help spread the souped-up WhatsApp much farther and faster, he said. But the corporate allegiance also has a price. After years of pledging that it would not share information about users with Facebook, which already has digital dossiers on its own 1.7 billion users, WhatsApp revised its privacy statement in August to say it would do exactly that. That means Facebook knows whom WhatsApp users contact and their phone numbers.Some users complained, but Koum said that he had not seen a shift in behavior.“In terms of security and privacy, what people care about the most is the privacy of their messages,” he said.The video service is well integrated and adds a few twists. Users can move around the thumbnail video showing what their correspondent sees and flick a video call in progress to the side to minimize it while checking texts or email. Koum said WhatsApp remained committed to security after the U.S. election of Donald Trump as president last week heightened fears of increased surveillance.Trump, along with some leading congressional Republicans and FBI Director James Comey, has advocated requiring tech companies to turn over customer information in many circumstances, a position which, if put into law, could require companies including WhatsApp to completely redesign their services.Other countries including China and the United Kingdom also take a dim view of encryption.But Koum said he not see a major threat to his service, noting that diplomats and officials use WhatsApp in many countries.“It would be like them shooting themselves in the foot.” (Reporting by Joseph Menn; Editing by Jonathan Weber and Cynthia Osterman)",2016-11-15,FB,"Tue Nov 15, 2016 | 2:05am EST",Facebook's WhatsApp adds secure video calling amid privacy concerns,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-facebook-whatsapp-video-idUSKBN13A0I8?type=companyNews

The world's biggest online social network on Wednesday launched a new blog on its website called Metrics FYI, where it will share updates and corrections for its data.“We want to ensure our clients trust and believe in the metrics that we are providing,” Carolyn Everson, Facebook's vice president of global market solutions told Reuters.Getting advertisers to buy more video ads is key to Facebook’s continued revenue growth, as they fetch higher rates from advertisers than text or photo-based ads.Facebook, along with Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google and other large digital companies, has been criticized for a lack of transparency in how it measures the performance of videos. Particularly, the lack of a universally agreed method of calculating how much time people are watching online video has been a sore spot for advertisers. Shares of Facebook were down 2.5 percent at $114.30 in premarket trading on the New York Stock Exchange.In September, Facebook told advertisers that the average time users spent viewing online ads was artificially inflated, because it was only counting videos that were watched for at least three seconds, its benchmark for a “view.”Facebook left out those who watched for less than three seconds, or who did not watch the video at all, which gave advertisers the impression their videos were performing better than they really were. Since the admission and ensuing criticism from advertisers, Everson said Facebook has been in contact with clients and ad community trade groups, including the Interactive Advertising Bureau and the Association of National Advertisers (ANA).Facebook also said on Wednesday it is in the process of forming what it called a 'Measurement Council,' which will include measurement experts from clients and ad agencies.

1013,"   By Sarah Young | LONDON  LONDON Facebook (FB.O) said it would expand its presence in Britain by 50 percent in 2017, joining other U.S. technology firms in increasing investment despite the uncertainty sparked by the country's vote to leave the European Union. The social network firm said it would hire 500 new staff, adding to the 1,000 people it already employs in Britain, as Facebook gears up to open a new UK headquarters in London next year, following other firms drawn by talent and a thriving tech start-up scene. Before the Brexit referendum in June, campaigners in favor of remaining in the EU had warned that international companies could seek to reduce their presence in Britain as a withdrawal from the bloc would make it a less attractive place to invest.Some big banks such as Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and Citi (C.N), which employ many thousands in London's financial center, are said to be considering shifting some jobs elsewhere in Europe as a result of Brexit, a worry for the British economy where financial services account for around 10 percent of output and provide some of the best paying jobs.Facebook's UK expansion comes after Google (GOOGL.O), owned by parent company Alphabet Inc, said earlier in November that it would invest an estimated 1 billion pounds, and make 3,000 new hires in the Britain.""The UK is definitely one of the very best places to be a technology company,"" Facebook vice-president of Europe, Middle East and Africa Nicola Mendelsohn said at a conference run by the CBI, an employers group, adding that it was too early to say what Brexit would mean for the movement of labor.""The movement of talent is something...that matters to us."" she said, adding that Facebook employs people of 65 different nationalities in Britain. Facebook opened its first engineering office outside the U.S. in London in 2012 and has been growing rapidly in the UK since. Its main UK operating unit's staffing increased by 90 percent in 2015 from 2014, according to its latest accounts, with more than half of those hired engineers.It also employs hundreds of sales and marketing staff who tend to focus on larger clients or running regional teams, according to Facebook job ads and linkedIN profiles of staff.Amazon (AMZN.O), which created 3,500 UK jobs in 2016 at its head office, research and development centers, customer service centers and distribution depots, plans a further 2,300 jobs at three new distribution centers in 2017. AMAZING ECOSYSTEM Such investments have helped Britain's tech sector to shine at a time when some other firms are less optimistic.A recent survey showed that three out of four companies with sales between 100 million pounds and 1 billion pounds have considered moving operations to the European continent in the wake of the vote.Mendelsohn said that Britain needed to work hard to keep its position as a global hub for technology.  ""We need to make sure that we continue to look outwards and not inwards; we need to stay competitive, and we need to remain a welcome home to tech,"" she said. London ranked no.1 for start-ups in the 2016 European Digital City Index, and Google said the talent pool, educational institutions, and passion for innovation helped it decide to invest more in Britain, sentiments echoed by Mendelsohn.

""The UK remains one of the best places to be a tech company and is an important part of Facebook's story,"" Europe, Middle East and Africa vice-president Nicola Mendelsohn will say at a conference run by the CBI, an employers group, later on Monday.Facebook's expansion comes after Google, owned by parent company Alphabet Inc, said earlier in November that it would invest in thousands of extra engineers as part of its move to a new London building. Britain is also benefiting from the growth of online retailer Amazon, which expects to create 3,500 UK jobs in 2016, including at its head office, research and development centres, customer service centres and distribution depots.It plans a further 2,300 at three new distribution centres in 2017.

1023,"   By Kristina Cooke | MENLO PARK, Calif.  MENLO PARK, Calif. Facebook Inc (FB.O) is working on automatically flagging offensive material in live video streams, building on a growing effort to use artificial intelligence to monitor content, said Joaquin Candela, the company’s director of applied machine learning.The social media company has been embroiled in a number of content moderation controversies this year, from facing international outcry after removing an iconic Vietnam War photo due to nudity, to allowing the spread of fake news on its site.Facebook has historically relied mostly on users to report offensive posts, which are then checked by Facebook employees against company ""community standards."" Decisions on especially thorny content issues that might require policy changes are made by top executives at the company.Candela told reporters that Facebook increasingly was using artificial intelligence to find offensive material. It is “an algorithm that detects nudity, violence, or any of the things that are not according to our policies,” he said.The company already had been working on using automation to flag extremist video content, as Reuters reported in June. Now the automated system also is being tested on Facebook Live, the streaming video service for users to broadcast live video. Using artificial intelligence to flag live video is still at the research stage, and has two challenges, Candela said. “One, your computer vision algorithm has to be fast, and I think we can push there, and the other one is you need to prioritize things in the right way so that a human looks at it, an expert who understands our policies, and takes it down.”  Facebook said it also uses automation to process the tens of millions of reports it gets each week, to recognize duplicate reports and route the flagged content to reviewers with the appropriate subject matter expertise.Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg in November said Facebook would turn to automation as part of a plan to identify fake news. Ahead of the Nov. 8 U.S. election, Facebook users saw fake news reports erroneously alleging that Pope Francis endorsed Donald Trump and that a federal agent who had been investigating Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton was found dead.However, determining whether a particular comment is hateful or bullying, for example, requires context, the company said. Yann LeCun, Facebook’s director of AI research, declined to comment on using AI to detect fake news, but said in general news feed improvements provoked questions of tradeoffs between filtering and censorship, freedom of expressions and decency and truthfulness.“These are questions that go way beyond whether we can develop AI,” said LeCun. “Tradeoffs that I’m not well placed to determine.” (Reporting by Kristina Cooke; Editing by Peter Henderson)",2016-12-01,FB,"Thu Dec 1, 2016 | 12:07pm EST",Facebook developing artificial intelligence to flag offensive live videos,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-facebook-ai-video-idUSKBN13Q52M?type=companyNews

The donation was made on Nov. 21, according to the filing. bit.ly/2gIf3yWThis comes months after Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan said they would donate more than $3 billion toward a plan to ""cure, prevent or manage"" disease.In December 2015, Zuckerberg made one of the largest pledges in history when he and his wife said they would donate 99 percent of their company shares to charity.

1025,"   By Julia Fioretti | BRUSSELS  BRUSSELS Web giants YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and Microsoft will step up efforts to remove extremist content from their websites by creating a common database.The companies will share 'hashes' - unique digital fingerprints they automatically assign to videos or photos - of extremist content they have removed from their websites to enable their peers to identify the same content on their platforms.   ""We hope this collaboration will lead to greater efficiency as we continue to enforce our policies to help curb the pressing global issue of terrorist content online,"" the companies said in a statement on Tuesday.Tech companies have long resisted outside intervention in how their sites should be policed, but have come under increasing pressure from Western governments to do more to remove extremist content following a wave of militant attacks.YouTube and Facebook have begun to use hashes to automatically remove extremist content. But many providers have relied until now mainly on users to flag content that violates terms of service. Flagged material is then individually reviewed by human editors who delete postings found to be in violation.Twitter suspended 235,000 accounts between February and August this year and has expanded the teams reviewing reports of extremist content. Each company will decide what image and video hashes to add to the database and matching content will not be automatically removed, they said.The database will be up and running in early 2017 and more companies could be brought into the partnership.The European Union set up an EU Internet Forum last year bringing together the internet companies, interior ministers and the EU Counter-Terrorism Coordinator to find ways of removing extremist content. The Forum will meet again on Thursday, when ministers are expected to ask the companies about their efforts and helping to provide evidence to convict foreign fighters.

1026,"   By Stine Jacobsen and Mia Shanley | OSLO  OSLO Norwegian media group Schibsted plans to add 200 people to its 1,800-strong technology team in the next year to further develop its online classified ads business and fend off competition from Facebook, its chief executive says.Schibsted holds market-leading positions in local classified advertising websites across Europe including Finn in Norway and Leboncoin in France, and has a big presence in Asia and Latin America.Everything from old ski clothes to cars are bought and sold on Schibsted's sites while the company is recruiting heavily to deepen its offering in categories like real estate and jobs.Schibsted faces a test of whether it can fend off the likes of Facebook and Google, exploiting its local character in a $21 billion industry which McKinsey & Co sees growing at 10 percent annually.Facebook, which is searching for new ways to engage users, launched its ""Marketplace"" in October where people can buy and sell items locally, in what was seen as a step into the classified advertising market.Facebook must be taken ""very seriously"", Schibsted Chief Executive Rolv Erik Ryssdal told Reuters in an interview.""So far, we think they are enlarging the total market, but we are watching very closely what they are doing,"" he said.The classified ads business accounted for 38 percent of Schibsted's revenues last year and 81 percent of its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, which amounted to 2 billion crowns ($239 million). The launch of Facebook's Marketplace has weighed heavily on Schibsted shares, which have fallen 22 percent since October to trade around 177.6 crowns on Tuesday, a near 40 percent drop this year.""If Facebook is serious about this and willing to say 'this is a game for me which I'm willing to play for the next five years' I think they are in a very strong position to win this game,"" said Thomas Schumacher, an online marketplace specialist at Digital McKinsey.TECH TALENT  With 6,800 employees in 30 countries, Schibsted dominates the classified ads market in much of Europe. South Africa's Naspers runs Russia's biggest classified ads site, while in the United States a range of players including letgo, eBay and start-up OfferUp compete in the market.Schibsted has been cutting costs in its newspaper division while spending more on its technology operations and recruiting in its five European technology hubs of London, Barcelona, Stockholm, Oslo and Krakow.In the past two years Schibsted has recruited a team of 100 in London. Facebook announced last month it would hire 500 new staff in Britain next year, adding to the 1,000 people it already employs there.Schibsted is investing in its mobile ""boot sale"" app Shpock which is available in six countries. It is also working to boost its professional content, aimed at commercial sellers, in real estate, jobs and cars - areas which it believes can generate greater revenues.  Developers are working on products like messaging, automatic picture recognition and pricing tools for professionals.One Nordic fund manager with a position in Schibsted felt the Facebook threat had been overplayed as it looked like the social media giant was not planning much in the ""professional"" market.Ryssdal said it would require something very special to disrupt the markets that Schibsted dominates today.""Traditionally what Facebook and Google are good at is making big and scalable solutions while what we are good at is focusing on exactly what are we doing and then adapting to local markets both product-wise but also with boots on the ground,"" he said.
