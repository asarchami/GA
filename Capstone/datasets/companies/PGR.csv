2,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, December 17 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the Progressive  Corporation's (NYSE: PGR) Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of 'A+', senior debt  ratings of 'A', and junior debt rating of 'BBB+'. Fitch also affirms  Progressive's operating subsidiaries' Insurer Financial Strength (IFS) rating at  'AA'. A complete list of ratings follows the end of the release. The Rating  Outlook is Stable. KEY RATING DRIVERS Fitch's affirmation follows PGR's announcement that it entered into an agreement  to acquire a controlling interest in ARX Holding Corporation (ARX), the parent  company of homeowners' insurance specialist American Strategic Insurance (ASI),  for total consideration of $875 million in cash, a price that represents  approximately 2.6 times book value. The transaction would bring PGR's ownership  interest in ARX to 67% from its current 5% stake in the company acquired in  2012.  The transaction is expected to close by April 1, 2015, subject to closing  conditions. PGR also has the option to purchase the remaining 33% of ARX over  the next six years. ASI's management team is expected to remain in place and the  company will continue to be run as a separate entity.  PGR is expected to use ARX to enhance product offerings that include bundled  personal auto and homeowners policies which have historically been a limited  segment for the company but could in time become a larger portion of PGR's  business mix. ARX's net premiums through nine months 2014 represent  approximately 4% of Progressive's overall net premiums written during the  period.  As primarily a Florida and Gulf Coast writer of homeowners' insurance policies,  ARX presents an increased presence of gross catastrophe loss exposures for PGR.  ARX has traditionally relied on substantial catastrophe reinsurance coverage to  manage net catastrophe exposures.  The company has experienced significant  premium growth and generated favorable underwriting results over the last five  years, and has fortunately not experienced large catastrophe related losses over  this period. Looking forward, there is some uncertainty regarding future expansion plans by  PGR in the homeowners' line in terms of overall premium growth targets and  geographic business mix, and strategies for managing gross and net of  reinsurance catastrophe exposures. Homeowners' growth that substantially  increases probable maximum loss (PML) levels could lead to a negative change in  ratings or Rating Outlooks.    Fitch's ratings for Progressive continue to be based on excellent operating  performance, pricing and underwriting expertise, a unique personal auto  insurance franchise, conservative investment allocation, and strong risk-based  capital position.   Fitch continues to view Progressive as one of the strongest underwriters among  major property/casualty companies, and recognizes the company's history of  strong underwriting margins and stability. Progressive's financial leverage, as measured by total debt to total capital, is  expected to remain within a reasonable range for the rating category in the near  term.  The company's financial leverage at Sept. 30, 2014 was 24.1%.  Progressive's profitability promotes strong interest coverage.  Annualized GAAP  fixed charge coverage at nine months 2014 was 14.4x, up from year-end 2013 of  12.8x.  Fitch believes that GAAP fixed charge coverage will range from high  single digits to low double digits over the near term.   RATING SENSITIVITIES Factors that could lead to a ratings downgrade include: --Obtaining a GAAP calendar-year combined ratio of 99% or higher;  --Failure to maintain a Prism score of 'Very Strong' or better. Based on  year-end 2013 data PGR's Prism score was 'Very Strong'; --An increase in statutory net leverage, defined as net written premiums plus  total liabilities relative to policyholders surplus plus Progressive Investment  Company, Inc's assets, above 5x;  --Failure to maintain statutory maximum dividend coverage ratio of 7x or higher  on a sustained basis; --A meaningful change to the auto insurance market that unfavorably alters the  operating environment; -- Homeowners' growth that substantially increases PML levels. Fitch believes that a ratings upgrade for Progressive is unlikely in the near  term given the company's narrow product focus and high notional leverage.   Fitch has affirmed the following ratings with a Stable Outlook: The Progressive Corporation --IDR at 'A+'; --$500 million 3.75% due Aug. 23, 2021 at 'A'; --$300 million 6.625% due March 31, 2029 at 'A'; --$400 million 6.25% due Dec. 1, 2032 at 'A'; --$350 million 4.35% due Apr. 25, 2044 at 'A'; --Junior subordinated debentures at 'BBB+'. --$732 million 6.7% due June 18, 2067 at 'BBB+'.

3,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, January 21 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings expects to assign an 'A' rating to  Progressive Corporation's (NYSE: PGR) $400 million issuance of senior unsecured  notes maturing in 2045. The new notes' rating is equivalent to the ratings on  PGR's existing senior debt.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Fitch's anticipated rating reflects PGR's strong balance sheet and Fitch's  belief that PGR's financial leverage, as measured by total debt to total  capital, will remain within a reasonable range for the rating category in the  near term. PGR's financial leverage at Sept. 30, 2014 was 24.1%. Pro-forma  leverage as of nine months 2014, including the additional debt, will temporarily  increase to 27.3%, within Fitch's expectations. Progressive's profitability promotes strong interest coverage. GAAP fixed charge  coverage through the first nine months of 2014 was 14.4 times (x) up from year  end 2013 of 12.9x. Fitch believes that GAAP fixed charge coverage will range  from high single digits to low double digits over the near term. On Dec. 17, 2014, Fitch affirmed all of its ratings for PGR and PGR's  subsidiaries with a Stable Outlook following the company's announcement that it  entered into an agreement to acquire a controlling interest in ARX Holding  Corporation (ARX), the parent company of homeowners' insurance specialist  American Strategic Insurance (ASI). The acquisition added uncertainty regarding future expansion plans by PGR in the  homeowners' line in terms of overall premium growth targets and geographic  business mix, and strategies for managing gross and net of reinsurance  catastrophe exposures. Further increases in financial leverage or homeowners' growth that substantially  increases probable maximum loss (PML) levels could lead to a negative change in  ratings or Rating Outlooks. RATING SENSITIVITIES Factors that could lead to a ratings downgrade include the following: --Obtaining a GAAP calendar year combined ratio of 99% or higher.  --Failure to maintain a Prism score of 'Very Strong' or better. Based on  year-end 2013 data PGR's Prism score was 'Very Strong.' --An increase in statutory net leverage, defined as net written premiums plus  total liabilities relative to policyholders surplus plus Progressive Investment  Company, Inc's assets, above 5.0x.  --Failure to maintain statutory maximum dividend coverage ratio of 7.0x or  higher on a sustained basis. --A meaningful change to the auto insurance market that unfavorably alters  operating environment. --Homeowners' growth that substantially increases probable maximum loss (PML)  levels.

4,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, December 11 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed The Progressive  Corporation's (NYSE: PGR) Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of 'A+', senior debt  ratings of 'A', and junior debt of 'BBB+'. Fitch also affirms Progressive's  operating subsidiaries' Insurer Financial Strength (IFS) rating at 'AA'. A  complete list of ratings follows the end of the release. The Rating Outlook is  Stable. KEY RATING DRIVERS Fitch's ratings are based on Progressive's excellent operating performance,  pricing and underwriting expertise, personal auto insurance franchise,  conservative investment allocation, and strong risk-based capital position. Fitch views the company's market position and size/scale as 'Large' and notes  that companies with this profile are typically rated in the 'AA' IFS rating  category. Progressive is the fourth-largest U.S. private passenger auto writer  based on 2014 premium written. Fitch views Progressive's market share and  competitive positioning in its key line of business as slightly favorable  relative to peers. Progressive completed its acquisition of a controlling interest in ARX Holding  Corporation (ARX), the parent company of homeowners' insurance specialist  American Strategic Insurance (ASI) on April 1, 2015. Progressive's Property  segment consists primarily of the business acquired with the ARX transaction and  accounted for approximately 3.2% of total net premiums written by the company in  the third quarter of 2015. Progressive's overall GAAP combined ratio was 92.7% through the first three  quarters of 2015, an improvement over the nine month 2014 result of 92.9%.  Embedded in PGR's culture is obtaining a GAAP calendar year combined ratio of  96% or better. Fitch continues to view Progressive as one of the strongest  underwriters among major property/casualty companies, and recognizes the  company's history of favorable underwriting margins and stability. Capitalization at the operating company level scored 'Very Strong' based on  year-end 2014 data on Fitch's proprietary capital model, Prism, which is  considered consistent with Progressive's 'AA' IFS rating. Total shareholders'  equity increased by 7.6% to nearly $7.5 billion at Sep. 30, 2015, driven by net  earnings of $951 million, offset by $245 million of unrealized investment losses  during the first nine months of the year. Progressive's financial leverage, as measured by total debt to total capital, is  anticipated to remain near current levels in the near term. The company's  debt-to-total capital ratio adjusted for the impact of FAS 115 unrealized gains  on fixed income investments as of Sept. 30, 2015 was 26.8%, following  Progressive's $400 million 1st quarter 2015 senior debt issuance. Progressive's profitability promotes strong interest coverage. GAAP fixed charge  coverage at nine months 2015 was 13.8 times(x), up from the five-year average  between 2010-2014 of 12.1x. Fitch believes that GAAP fixed charge coverage will  range from high single digits to low double digits over the near term. RATING SENSITIVITIES Factors that could lead to a ratings downgrade include the following: --Obtaining a GAAP calendar year combined ratio of 99% or higher.  --Failure to maintain a Prism score of 'Very Strong' or better. --An increase in statutory net leverage, defined as net written premiums plus  total liabilities relative to policyholders surplus plus Progressive Investment  Company, Inc's assets, above 5.0x.  --Failure to maintain statutory maximum dividend coverage ratio of 7.0x or  higher on a sustained basis. --A meaningful change to the auto insurance market that unfavorably alters  operating environment. -- Homeowners' growth that substantially increases probable maximum loss (PML)  levels. Fitch believes that a ratings upgrade for Progressive would require a broadened  product focus with a material reduction of net leverage.

6,"   By Joseph White  Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] will use Progressive Insurance to provide coverage for drivers in Texas beginning on Friday, in a pilot that could lead the ride-hailing market leader to diversify its U.S. insurance purchasing from its current sole provider, Uber and Progressive executives told Reuters.Uber has been purchasing insurance to cover drivers for its primary ride-hailing services, such as UberX, from James River Insurance Company, a unit of James River Group Holdings (JRVR.O). In the United States, Uber said it covers each ride with $1 million of liability coverage per incident and $1 million of injury coverage for underinsured or uninsured motorists, in addition to other coverage.Recent changes in Texas insurance rules made it more attractive for Progressive to offer a plan to cover Uber drivers there, Uber and Progressive said. Progressive Corp (PGR.N) this year launched ""transportation network companies,"" or TNC insurance product, aimed at individuals who use their vehicles to carry passengers for ride-hailing services such as Uber or its rival Lyft. John Barbagallo, Progressive Insurance’s Commercial Lines group president, said Progressive sees ride-sharing growing. ""We’re excited about the pilot,"" he told Reuters. Other large auto insurers have begun rolling out coverage tailored to ride-hailing service drivers, filling a void that had existed for drivers whose personal policies did not cover accidents that happened when they were driving passengers for pay.Uber's senior director of insurance, Gus Fuldner, said the company does not have immediate plans to use other insurance providers in other states. Uber and Progressive did not disclose financial terms of the Texas program, but did say Uber will be buying coverage for thousands of drivers.James River Group President Bob Myron said his company had expected Uber's move, but said he expects James River will continue to have ""an important relationship with Uber,"" that will grow as the numbers of Uber drivers expands. James River is not aware of other states where Uber plans to switch insurance providers, Myron said.
