0,"  WASHINGTON Jan 22 The U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday ruled in favor of medical devices maker Medtronic Inc  in its dispute with privately owned Mirowski Family Ventures LLC over whether the larger company infringed on Mirowski's patents in making certain pacemakers.The case stems from Medtronic's decision to ask a judge to rule that some of its pacemakers do not infringe on technology patented by Mirowski and licensed to Boston Scientific  as well as Guidant Corp, part of Boston Scientific and Abbott Laboratories.A court in Delaware ruled for Medtronic, saying that even though Medtronic requested the ruling, or declaratory judgment,  it was up to Mirowski to prove infringement. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit disagreed, saying it was up to Medtronic to prove its case. The Supreme Court reversed that decision, arguing that the patent holder, in this case Mirowski, ordinarily must prove infringement and that this case was no different.""We hold that, when a licensee seeks a declaratory judgment against a patentee (patent holder) to establish that there is no infringement, the burden of proving infringement remains with the patentee,"" the Supreme Court said in a decision written by Justice Stephen Breyer. The two patents in the case have to do with cardiac resynchronization therapy, a pacemaker that detects when the heart beats out of sync and then emits tiny shocks of electricity to correct its rhythm. It is used to treat congestive heart failure.Medtronic licensed the patents in question, but in 2007, Mirowski Family Ventures claimed Medtronic was developing new products that would also justify royalty payments. Medtronic filed suit, seeking a ruling that it did not need to pay. Wednesday's decision means that the case will return to lower courts for further proceedings, including a fight over infringement, said Arthur Neustadt, senior partner at Oblon Spivak LLP, who argued for Mirowski at the Supreme Court.""The burden of proof issue wasn't one of the more significant issues,"" he said. ""Now it goes back to Federal Circuit for other issues to be considered.""The case is Medtronic v Boston Scientific Corp, Guidant Corp, and Mirowski Family Ventures, U.S. Supreme Court, No. 12-1128",2014-01-22,BSX,"Wed Jan 22, 2014 | 4:19pm EST",UPDATE 1-U.S. Supreme Court tosses out Medtronic pacemaker patent loss,http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-court-medtronic-idUSL2N0KW12H20140122?type=companyNews

2,"   By Susan Kelly  Medtronic Inc's stumble in its U.S. medical device study to treat high blood pressure could create an opportunity for other device makers to pick up where their rival has left off, Boston Scientific Corp Chief Executive Mike Mahoney said on Tuesday.Called the silent killer, high blood pressure affects as many as one in three American adults, and medical device makers were racing to develop a procedure to treat it before the failure of Medtronic's major clinical trial.Boston Scientific is still forging ahead with plans to develop its own blood-pressure-lowering device, called a renal denervation system, for sale in the United States, Mahoney said in an interview.Renal denervation devices create tiny scars along nerves in the kidneys, which play a pivotal role in regulating blood pressure by sending signals to the brain that can cause blood vessels to constrict.The procedure currently is intended as an alternative to drug therapy for patients whose blood pressure is not well controlled by traditional medications.Boston Scientific will examine data from Medtronic's halted study, in which the company's device failed to prove effective, as it designs the U.S. clinical trial for its own product, Mahoney said. ""Right now it's going to be a slower market until BSC or another company delivers on a trial. When that happens, the market will open up, and it has the potential to be a multi-billion-dollar market,"" he said.Medtronic had a jump start on the U.S. market in the development of a treatment, but the failure of its Symplicity device in the study, announced in January, caught many observers by surprise.Less than two weeks later, Covidien Plc said it would stop making its hypertension device, which was approved for sale in Europe in February 2012, due to weak demand. Mahoney said repercussions from Medtronic's failed U.S. study will be felt in Europe, where cardiologists will be less inclined to recommend the treatment until more evidence of its effectiveness can be demonstrated in more clinical trials.Medtronic continues to sell its device there, and Boston Scientific in December launched its own offering. St. Jude Medical Inc is also rolling out a hypertension device in Europe.But Boston Scientific remains optimistic about the technology's potential to help the millions of people struggling to control their blood pressure, Mahoney said. High blood pressure increases the risk for heart disease and stroke but often has no symptoms.""There's clearly a huge patient unmet need,"" he said.Mahoney said Boston Scientific's device has features that differentiate it from Medtronic's product, making it more consistent, faster to use and less painful for the patient. ""We do feel the platform we have is a superior platform,"" he said.Medtronic has said it will form an independent panel of medical experts to make recommendations on the future of its renal denervation product.Boston Scientific acquired its renal denervation system through the purchase of Vessix Vascular Inc in November 2012.(Reporting by Susan Kelly in Chicago)",2014-02-04,BSX,"Tue Feb 4, 2014 | 5:23pm EST",Boston Scientific sees opportunity in rival's setback,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-bostonscientific-medtronic-idUSBREA131PO20140204?type=companyNews

21,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, July 09 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Boston Scientific Corp.'s  (NYSE: BSX) long-term IDR at 'BBB-' with a Stable Outlook. A full list of BSX's  ratings follows at the end of this release. The rating action applies to  approximately $4.25 billion of debt.  KEY RATING DRIVERS: --Fitch expects BSX will operate with relatively stable leverage (total  debt/EBITDA) of 2.3x-2.5x during the next 12 months, despite a challenging  operating environment. However, current leverage of 2.44x at March 31, 2014  leaves only modest flexibility within BSX's 'BBB-' rating category. --Fitch forecasts that BSX's improving operational performance will generate  consistently solid FCF, given relatively manageable CAPEX requirements.  BSX is  expected to maintain adequate liquidity through revolver availability and access  to the capital markets. --BSX's Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD) and drug-eluting stent  (DES) segments are expected to gradually improve, as (i) procedure volumes  stabilize, (ii) the company introduces new products into the space that offer  opportunities for incremental share gains and margin support and (iii) growth in  emerging markets begins to contribute more significantly to revenues.   -- BSX's other business segments, which generate roughly 63% of BSX's total firm  sales are expected to deliver, in the aggregate, solid single-digit growth.  --BSX has made progress in mitigating its litigation risk through settlements  and some legal victories. Nevertheless, BSX is still facing a few legal actions  that pose material financial risks. --Fitch forecasts that BSX will generate $800 million to $900 million in free  cash flow (FCF) during 2014 and prioritize cash deployment for targeted  acquisitions and share repurchases. STABLE OPERATIONS AND LEVERAGE IN NEAR TERM Fitch expects that operational headwinds will moderate for BSX during the next  12 months as new product introductions help to support margins and revenue  growth. This should also offset the negative effect of pricing pressures on  existing products and moderate shifts in treatment paradigms.   Nevertheless, with leverage at 2.44x, BSX will need to keep debt levels  basically flat, in order to maintain leverage within the 2.3x-2.5x range,  leaving only modest flexibility within BSX's 'BBB-'' credit rating. Fitch does  expect that improved growth and profitability will enable BSX to reduce leverage  without significant reliance on debt reduction.  SOLID CASH FLOW FORECASTED Fitch forecasts that BSX will generate $800 million to $900 million of FCF  during 2014. Moderately improving sales and margins through new product  introductions and continued cost control efforts are expected to drive solid  cash flow from operations. Capital expenditure requirements for 2014 are  forecasted to be manageable in the range of $240 million - $250 million. In  addition, Fitch believes BSX will continue to generate consistently strong FCF  during the intermediate term. IMPROVING ICD AND DES SEGMENTS BSX's ICD and DES businesses are expected to gradually improve during the next  12-24 months. The stabilizing of surgical procedures should continue to  stabilize for both segments, driven by favorable comparisons of a multi-year  period of soft procedure volumes resulting from the publication of negative  clinical data identified in two large retrospective studies.  BSX will continue  to introduce new products into these two markets, offering the company a number  of opportunities to increase share and revenue. Longer-term, BSX's investment in  emerging markets is expected support revenue growth.  STEADY PERFORMANCE IN REMAINING SEGMENTS Endosurgery, Neuromodulation, Peripheral Interventions and Electrophysiology are  expected, in the aggregate, to deliver solid single-digit growth. These segments  generate roughly 63% of BSX's total firm sales. The medical devices in these  segments are experiencing decent growth and are not as highly priced as  pacemakers and ICDs. Given the relatively smaller dollars at stake, payers do  not appear as focused on price. In addition, Fitch expects BSX will continue to  launch new higher-margin products in these respective markets. As such, Fitch  believes that segment margins will remain somewhat stable.  IMPROVING BUT MEANINGFUL LITIGATION RISK BSX continues to make progress in resolving litigation issues, resulting in an  improved litigation risk profile during the past five years. However, some  financial risk related to other litigation remains and BSX will need to  prioritize cash accordingly for potential settlements. Fitch's rating action  assumes there will be some cash settlements will be made by BSX. However, a  significant judgment against the company regarding the JNJ contract lawsuit  regarding the Guidant acquisition that would require meaningful debt could prove  problematic for the company's credit rating.  CASH DEPLOYMENT FOCUSED ON GROWTH AND SHAREHOLDERS Fitch believes BSX's acquisition strategy will remain targeted, focusing on  areas that offer innovation and growth. BSX will likely balance share  repurchases and acquisitions depending on the availability of attractive targets  and in lieu of debt reduction. Fitch forecasts that BSX will generate $800  million to $900 million in FCF during 2014, which should be sufficient to fund  targeted acquisitions and share repurchases. As such, Fitch does not expect  significant increases in debt, absent large transactions. ADEQUATE LIQUIDITY: BSX has adequate liquidity provided by positive FCF and access to the credit  markets. FCF for the latest 12-month period (LTM) ending March 31, 2014 was $837  million. At the end of the period, BSX had approximately $217 million in  cash/short-term investments; nearly full availability on its $2 billion revolver  which matures on April 18, 2017; and full availability on its $300 million  364-day accounts receivable facility which matures in June 2015. BSX had  approximately $4.2 billion in debt, with roughly $400 million maturing in 2015,  $600 million in 2016, and $250 million in 2017. Fitch anticipates that BSX will  refinance its maturities with debt issuances rather than pay them down. RATING SENSITIVITIES: Positive: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  positive rating action include the following: --Continued operational improvements that support long-term positive revenue  growth and margin stability/improvement; --An operational profile that could lead to significant and durable increases in  FCF; --Cash deployment policy and resulting capital structure that would durably  sustain leverage below 2.2x-2.3x. Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  negative rating action include the following:  --Material and lasting deterioration in operations and FCF; --Persistent increase in leverage approaching 3.0x; --Leveraging acquisitions without the prospect of timely debt/leverage  reduction; --Large legal settlement(s) that would need to be funded with significant debt  issuance(s). RATING ACTIONS: Fitch has affirmed the following ratings for BSX with a Stable Outlook: --Long-term IDR at 'BBB-'; --Unsecured bank credit facility at 'BBB-'; --Senior unsecured notes at 'BBB-'.

22,"  (Adds outlook, share movement, analyst comment)By Caroline HumerJuly 24 Boston Scientific Corp, which makes medical equipment, on Thursday reported a slightly higher-than-expected quarterly profit as improvements in its heart device business helped drive revenue up 4 percent.Boston Scientific said cardiac rhythm management sales, which include implantable defibrillators and pacemakers, rose 4 percent to $497 million in the second quarter from a year earlier after falling last quarter. Interventional cardiology, which includes sales of stents, rose 1 percent to $528 million.The Marlborough, Massachusetts company has cut jobs and other costs during the past several years to deal with slack global demand for medical services and products due to the economic downturn.Boston Scientific took $281 million in charges during the quarter to cover restructuring and other one-time costs, bringing its profit to $4 million, or nil per share. That is a decline from $130 million, or 10 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding special items, earnings came to 21 cents per share, beating expectations for 19 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Revenue rose to $1.87 billion from $1.79 billion, in line with analysts' expectations. Shares were unchanged at around $13.02 in morning trading.""I think one reason the stock is not up more is that it did rally into the quarter,"" said RBC Capital Markets analyst Glenn Novarro.""The quarter was very strong for them in stents and ICDs (implantable cardioverter defibrillators), and that's why investors buy the stock,"" he said. Boston Scientific shares are up 8.5 percent this year and 4.8 percent in the past week.The company raised its 2014 profit outlook because of the higher revenue as well as an anticipated tax rate of 12 percent to 14 percent rather than the 13 percent to 15 percent it had projected, Chief Financial Officer Daniel Brennan said during a conference call with investors.Boston Scientific forecast 2014 earnings per share at 79 cents to 83 cents, excluding items, up from a prior outlook of 77 cents to 82 cents.The company narrowed its 2014 revenue forecast to a range of $7.33 billion to $7.43 billion from a previous outlook of $7.30 billion to $7.50 billion. Analysts were expecting $7.39 billion.

24,"   By Jessica Dye  A Massachusetts jury has cleared Boston Scientific Corp of selling dangerous and defective transvaginal mesh devices, in the first out of more than 20,000 lawsuits waiting to go to trial. The verdict came Tuesday in a suit brought by Diane Albright, who in 2012 claimed that the Pinnacle device she was implanted with was faulty, causing complications that included pain, bleeding and incontinence. Following a trial of almost three weeks, jurors found that Boston Scientific was not liable for Albright's injuries. ""While we were disappointed with the verdict, it was a privilege to represent Mrs. Albright and to give a voice to her story,"" said her lawyer, Fidelma Fitzpatrick of Motley Rice. Boston Scientific spokeswoman Denise Kaigler said the company was pleased with the trial outcome and stood behind the importance of transvaginal mesh as a treatment option.  Transvaginal mesh devices are used to treat stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. Albright had claimed that the device's material was biologically incompatible with human tissue, prompting an immune response in some recipients. It could cause the pelvic tissue to break down, creating serious complications and sometimes requiring additional surgery to remove or replace the device, her lawsuit said. She claimed that Boston Scientific knew about these risks but failed to warn users and their physicians. The company has denied that it was liable for plaintiffs’ injuries.  Boston Scientific is facing more than 20,000 claims over the devices, including 1,700 that have been assigned to a single judge in Massachusetts state court and more than 12,000 that have been consolidated before a federal judge in West Virginia, according to a May 8 regulatory filing.  The next trial in Massachusetts is set for Aug. 11, Fitzpatrick said. The first trial in the federal cases is scheduled for Nov. 3.  Several other major medical-device manufacturers are facing claims over similar devices, including C.R. Bard Inc and Johnson & Johnson’s Ethicon unit. In April, one defendant, Endo International Plc, said it would pay $830 million to resolve thousands of claims brought against its American Medical Systems subsidiary. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a safety communication in 2011 saying that reports of serious complications in patients using transvaginal mesh devices were not rare, and that it was continuing to monitor the devices. The case is Albright v. Boston Scientific Corp, Middlesex County Superior Court, Massachusetts, No. 12-909.

26,"   By Ben Hirschler | BARCELONA  BARCELONA A Boston Scientific device that stimulates the vagus nerve – a superhighway connecting the brain to the rest of the body - failed to help patients with heart failure in a mid-stage clinical trial.Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), which involves delivering mild electrical pulses to the nerve in the neck, is already used to treat epilepsy and depression - and researchers have been looking to expand its use to other conditions.Faiez Zannad from the University of Lorraine in France, who led the study, said the failure of the device to improve cardiac function was surprising as pre-clinical research findings had been promising.Heart failure is a serious, progressive disease in which the heart fails to pump blood properly. It causes shortness of breath, fatigue and fluid retention, and is often fatal. Results from the U.S. medical technology company's NECTAR-HF trial, involving 95 heart failure patients in Europe, were unveiled on Saturday at the annual meeting of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC).Patients enrolled in the study had a VNS device implanted in their neck, near the right vagus nerve. Some of the patients had the devices switched off, while the others received regular stimulation. After six months, the study found no difference between the two groups. The result is a disappointment for Boston Scientific and Zannad said there were several possible explanations, including the fact that a stronger electrical pulse may have been needed and it might take longer than six months to show a benefit.Boston Scientific officials were not immediately available to comment. Cyberonics, the leading proponent of VNS in difficult-to-treat epilepsy and treatment-resistant depression, is also to present results from a clinical study in heart failure to the ESC meeting on Monday.VNS involves a pacemaker-like device the size of a small watch being surgically implanted under the skin on the patient's chest.

30,"   By Jessica Dye  A Texas jury has ordered Boston Scientific Corp to pay $73 million to a woman who said she suffered serious injuries from a transvaginal mesh device, the first loss for the device maker in one of thousands of suits over the products. The damage award and finding of gross negligence against the company came Monday evening following a two-week trial in a state court in Dallas, Texas, according to court filings.Plaintiff Martha Salazar, 42, was implanted with an Obtryx sling four years ago to treat urinary leakage, her lawyer David Matthews said. She now suffers from permanent nerve damage and constant pelvic pain, he said. Her lawsuit accused the company of designing and marketing a product it knew was defective. The company denied that it was liable.Following only a few hours of deliberations, the 12-person jury awarded Salazar approximately $23 million in compensatory damages for her actual and future suffering and $50 million in punitive damages after finding the company was grossly negligent, according to a court filing said. A representative for Boston Scientific, Kelly Leadem, said the company was strongly disappointed with the verdict and planned to appeal. The verdict comes in the third case to go to trial against Boston Scientific over the devices. The first two, which were tried in Massachusetts, resulted in verdicts absolving the company of liability. Boston Scientific is facing more than 23,000 lawsuits over transvaginal mesh devices, which are used to treat stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse, according to a recent regulatory filing. Thousands of the federal lawsuits against the company have been consolidated in West Virginia, where a first trial is scheduled to begin in October.   Boston Scientific is among seven device makers to face a wave of litigation over transvaginal mesh devices. Other defendants include C R Bard Inc and Johnson & Johnson’s Ethicon Inc unit. In April, Endo International’s American Medical Systems subsidiary became the first major manufacturer to largely settle the suits against it for $830 million. Only a handful of other mesh suits have gone to trial so far, and Salazar’s award is the largest so far.

31,"   By Jessica Dye | Sept 9  Sept 9 A Texas jury has ordered Boston Scientific Corp to pay $73 million to a woman who said she suffered serious injuries from a transvaginal mesh device, the first loss for the device maker in one of thousands of suits over the products.The damage award and finding of gross negligence against the company came Monday evening following a two-week trial in a state court in Dallas, Texas, according to court filings.Plaintiff Martha Salazar, 42, was implanted with an Obtryx sling four years ago to treat urinary leakage, her lawyer David Matthews said. She now suffers from permanent nerve damage and constant pelvic pain, he said. Her lawsuit accused the company of designing and marketing a product it knew was defective. The company denied that it was liable.Following only a few hours of deliberations, the 12-person jury awarded Salazar approximately $23 million in compensatory damages for her actual and future suffering and $50 million in punitive damages after finding the company was grossly negligent, according to a court filing said.A representative for Boston Scientific, Kelly Leadem, said the company was strongly disappointed with the verdict and planned to appeal. The verdict comes in the third case to go to trial against Boston Scientific over the devices. The first two, which were tried in Massachusetts, resulted in verdicts absolving the company of liability.Boston Scientific is facing more than 23,000 lawsuits over transvaginal mesh devices, which are used to treat stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse, according to a recent regulatory filing. Thousands of the federal lawsuits against the company have been consolidated in West Virginia, where a first trial is scheduled to begin in October.Boston Scientific is among seven device makers to face a wave of litigation over transvaginal mesh devices. Other defendants include C R Bard Inc and Johnson & Johnson's  Ethicon Inc unit.In April, Endo International's American Medical Systems subsidiary became the first major manufacturer to largely settle the suits against it for $830 million. Only a handful of other mesh suits have gone to trial so far, and Salazar's award is the largest so far.Last week, a jury in West Virginia awarded a woman who was implanted with an Ethicon device $3.27 million.

34,"   By Jessica Dye  A jury award of $73.4 million to a woman who said she was injured by a Boston Scientific Corp transvaginal mesh device has been cut to $34.6 million, thanks to a Texas law that caps how much companies must pay in punitive damages.Last month, jurors in Dallas found Boston Scientific liable for selling a defective Obtryx sling that was implanted in plaintiff Martha Salazar to treat urinary leakage. The jury awarded Salazar approximately $23 million in compensatory damages for actual suffering and $50 million in punitive damages after finding that Boston Scientific had been grossly negligent.  On Thursday, Dallas County Judge Ken Molberg ordered the punitive damages to be slashed to just over $11 million, citing a Texas law that limits damages designed to punish companies to no more than two times a plaintiff’s economic losses, plus up to $750,000 in non-economic losses. A lawyer for Salazar, David Matthews, said he had anticipated the reduction under state law. “It’s still a very significant finding for a single case,” he said. Boston Scientific did not immediately return a request for comment. Following the jury verdict last month, the company had said it planned to appeal.The company has faced three trials so far over its transvaginal mesh products, which are used to treat stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. The first two trials, which were heard in Massachusetts, resulted in wins for Boston Scientific. The third, Salazar’s case, was the first loss for the medical device manufacturer, which is facing more than 23,000 claims from women in federal and state courts across the country over the devices. Women allege that Boston Scientific sold the device knowing it was defective, causing a variety of injuries, including pain, bleeding and infection.  Thousands of federal lawsuits have been consolidated before a single judge in West Virginia, and additional trials in those cases are scheduled to begin in November. Boston Scientific is among seven device makers that have faced a wave of claims over similar products. Other defendants include C.R. Bard Inc and Johnson & Johnson’s Ethicon Inc unit.

38,"  (Adds update on litigation from company conference call)By Susan KellyOct 22 Boston Scientific Corp on Wednesday posted a third-quarter profit on increased sales of its implantable heart devices and raised its full-year revenue outlook, sending its shares up nearly 4 percent.The company also expressed confidence about an upcoming trial on a long-running legal dispute with Johnson & Johnson .Revenue climbed 6 percent in the quarter as new products gained momentum and sales of cardiac rhythm devices to manage irregular heartbeats and stents to treat clogged arteries helped the company take market share.""It was generally a very strong quarter,"" said Jefferies analyst Raj Denhoy. ""Revenue growth as well as margin improvements were good.""Sales of cardiac rhythm management devices, including implantable defibrillators and pacemakers, rose 3 percent to $480 million from a year earlier. Interventional cardiology sales, including stents, increased 8 percent to $508 million. Net income totaled $43 million, or 3 cents per share, compared with a year-earlier net loss of $5 million, or nil per share.The company has cut jobs and reduced other expenses over the past several years as the economic downturn hurt global demand for medical services, and clinical studies suggested stents and some cardiac rhythm devices were being overused. LITIGATION Boston Scientific said it had increased its litigation reserves by $139 million to a total of $945 million. The company is facing lawsuits over its transvaginal mesh products used to treat urinary incontinence.Executives told analysts on a conference call that they were confident of the company's position in the Johnson & Johnson case as well as the ability to handle any unfavorable outcome. The litigation stems from Boston Scientific's 2006 acquisition of Guidant Corp. Excluding charges for restructuring, litigation and other costs, earnings were 20 cents a share, matching the analysts' average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Revenue of $1.85 billion exceeded analysts' expectations of $1.82 billion.Boston Scientific raised the low end of its 2014 earnings forecast to 81 cents a share from 79 cents, excluding items, while keeping the high end at 83 cents.The company boosted its full-year revenue outlook to a range of $7.37 billion to $7.42 billion, from $7.33 billion to $7.43 billion.Its shares were up 3.7 percent at $12.47 in morning trading.

40,"   By Jessica Dye and Zachary Fagenson | MIAMI  MIAMI A lawyer representing four women in Miami federal court who say they were injured by Boston Scientific Corp’s transvaginal mesh accused the company on Monday of ignoring patient safety in its haste to get the devices on the market. “They set a priority that should never exist inside a medical device company – speed as No. 1,” said plaintiffs’ lawyer Jim Perdue during opening arguments in the trial, which is one of two that began Monday against the company over the devices.   Perdue is representing four women implanted with the company’s Pinnacle device to treat pelvic organ prolapse. During his opening statement, he said the company fast-tracked the device without performing any human or animal testing and used materials that it had been warned weren’t meant to be permanently implanted in human bodies, all in an effort to keep up with competitors. A lawyer for Boston Scientific, Molly Craig, said similar mesh products had been used successfully in a variety of medical applications for decades. Each woman suffered from serious problems and, along with their doctors, was well aware of the risks that went along with the device, she said.  “Just because a complication occurs does not mean a product is defective and doesn’t mean a person or company is at fault,” Craig told the nine-member jury.  The cases are among more than 23,000 that have been filed against Boston Scientific over its mesh devices in U.S. federal and state courts. Other device makers, including C.R. Bard and Johnson & Johnson’s Ethicon Inc, also face thousands of mesh cases.  Plaintiffs generally allege the devices are defectively made from a substandard material, causing injuries ranging from bleeding and infection to nerve damage and pain during sex. The company has said in previous statements that it has made patient safety a top priority and stands by the devices as an important treatment option for women. Boston Scientific has faced three trials over the devices so far, all in state court. The first two, in Massachusetts, ended in wins for the company. The third, in Texas, resulted in a $73 million verdict for the plaintiff, which was later reduced to $34 million under a state damages cap.  U.S. District Judge Joseph Goodwin, who is overseeing more than 66,000 mesh lawsuits against seven companies that make the device, is presiding over the trial in Miami, which he said he expected to last roughly 10 days.It is one of the first federal suits to go to trial against Boston Scientific over the devices. The other began Monday in West Virginia federal court involving claims from four women who say they were injured by the company’s Obtryx device, which is used to treat stress urinary incontinence.

Plaintiffs say the devices were poorly designed, made from substandard material and can lead to injuries ranging from infection and pain to bleeding and nerve damage.Ethicon and Boston Scientific have both denied liability and said in statements to Reuters that they believe mesh is an important treatment option. C.R. Bard declined to comment.The nine cases that have gone to trial so far, against Boston Scientific, Ethicon and C.R. Bard, have produced mixed results, with defendants winning some and plaintiffs others. One company, Endo International's American Medical Systems , announced recently that it would set aside $1.6 billion to settle ""substantially all"" mesh claims. The three trials faced by Boston Scientific in state courts have also led to varying outcomes. Two cases in Massachusetts resulted in wins for the company, while a third in Texas ended with a $73 million verdict for the plaintiff, which was later reduced to $34 million under a state law capping damages.The group trials starting Monday are part of Goodwin's plan to speed up the cases' progress. He has also ordered Boston Scientific and C.R. Bard to each prepare hundreds of cases for trial in courts across the United States starting as early as next year.While Goodwin originally scheduled a series of single-plaintiff bellwether, or test, trials for the federal litigation, he scrapped those plans earlier this year and instead consolidated claims from multiple women into a single trial. Doing so, he said, would help save courts' time and resources, and ""may facilitate settlement"" by giving Boston Scientific and plaintiffs a clearer picture of the strengths and weaknesses of their cases. While not unprecedented, it is unusual for personal-injury cases involving medical devices to proceed with more than one plaintiff at a time, given that individuals may have different medical histories and product experiences.Boston Scientific fought vigorously against the consolidated trial plan, saying in court filings that each woman's issues would be obscured by the group setting and prejudice jurors against the company.A company spokeswoman, Kelly Leadem, declined to comment specifically on the litigation but said in a statement that Boston Scientific is committed to patient safety.Several plaintiffs' lawyers for the women headed to trial Monday did not return requests for comment.Fidelma Fitzpatrick, an attorney at Motley Rice who has represented plaintiffs in other mesh trials against Boston Scientific and Ethicon, said the outcome from the group trials could help Boston Scientific and plaintiffs move closer to a resolution.""I think that Goodwin has been working hard to try to find an end game for this litigation,"" Fitzpatrick said. ""The reality is, one case at a time when you're trying four or five cases a year against a manufacturer isn't enough to truly put pressure on the defendants.""

47,"   By Jessica Dye and Zachary Fagenson | MIAMI  MIAMI Nov 13 A federal jury in Miami began Thursday to weigh whether Boston Scientific Corp is liable to four women who say they were injured by the company's transvaginal mesh devices in one of the first federal trials in thousands of suits over the devices.In closing arguments at the end of the eight-day trial, Shelley Hutson, a lawyer for the women, said Boston Scientific rushed dangerous products to market without performing adequate testing to fully understand the risks they posed.""If Boston Scientific told the physicians the truth, we wouldn't be here today,"" she told jurors. But a lawyer for Boston Scientific, Hildy Sastre, denied the  mesh products were dangerous and said the company had fully warned doctors about potential complications associated with the devices, particularly in the plaintiffs, who she said suffered from significant health problems.""There is no such thing as a risk-free surgery,"" Sastre said. The group trial is one of two that began last week against Boston Scientific. The Miami trial involves claims from women who were implanted with the company's Pinnacle device to treat pelvic organ prolapse. The Miami jurors are weighing whether Boston Scientific is liable to the women and, if so, how much the company owes them for injuries such as pain, bleeding and infection.If jurors decide the company is liable, they will also determine whether the company must pay punitive damages, although the amount of that award, if any, will be determined separately. The other trial, in West Virginia, concerns claims from four women over the Obtryx, which treats stress urinary incontinence. That trial is ongoing.The two trials are the first in more than 14,000 federal lawsuits against Boston Scientific that have been consolidated before U.S. District Judge Joseph Goodwin in the Southern District of West Virginia. Goodwin, who is handling the Miami trial, is overseeing more than 60,000 mesh lawsuits against seven manufacturers, including Johnson & Johnson's  Ethicon Inc unit and C.R. Bard.The outcome of these trials will serve as a ""bellwether,"" or test, for other cases, and help both sides assess the value of the claims. The company previously faced three trials in state courts, winning two and losing a third, in which it was ordered to pay $73 million in damages, later reduced to $34 million.

50,"   By Bill Berkrot | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Nov 19 Boston Scientific Corp's  next generation Synergy heart stent succeeded in a pivotal study that will be used to seek U.S. and Japanese approval of the device, according to data presented at the American Heart Association meeting in Chicago on Wednesday.The ultra thin Synergy drug eluting stent, featuring a bioabsorbable polymer coating that dissolves once the drug has been fully delivered after about three months, proved comparable to the company's widely used Promus Element Plus stent in key measures, achieving the main goal of the non-inferiority trial.Stents are tiny mesh tubes used to prop open diseased arteries that have been cleared of blockages. The drug coating delivered via the polymer helps prevent blood clots forming.In the 1,684-patient Evolve II study, the rate of target lesion failure, a combination of cardiac death, heart attack related to the treated blood vessel or need for repeat procedures, was 6.7 percent for Synergy versus 6.5 percent for Promus after 12 months, which was deemed highly statistically significant for non-inferiority. The rate of blood clots forming in the stent was minuscule at 0.4 percent for Synergy and 0.6 percent for Promus, with no definite stent thrombosis in the Synergy group after 24 hours.Based on the results, it would be hard for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to deny approval, study lead investigator Dr. Dean Kereiakes said. ""This adequately supports approval."" Synergy is already used in Europe, where medical devices typically get approved much sooner.Wells Fargo analyst Lawrence Biegelsen had said achieving non-inferiority ""should be enough to drive significant adoption of the product."" Over 20 percent of patients in the trial needed multiple stent placement and many were considered difficult to treat. Many patients had had heart attacks or a dangerous type of chest pain called unstable angina.""This was the most complex group of patients to be included in a pivotal trial for regulatory approval for any stent device to date,"" said Kereiakes, who has led many such studies.Kereiakes, from The Christ Hospital Heart & Vascular Center in Cincinnati, said Synergy was very user friendly, describing it as very flexible and easy to place compared with older stents. It was designed to facilitate and expedite healing, he added.As an operator, he said, ""I'm trying to make the tough cases easy and all cases easier.""

53,"  (Repeats without changes to headline or text)By Joseph AxNEW YORK Nov 19 Nearly a decade after losing a bidding war for device maker Guidant to Boston Scientific Corp , Johnson & Johnson finally has a chance for payback at a multibillion-dollar trial set to begin on Thursday.A federal court judge in New York will hear the case without a jury and decide whether Guidant, through its successor Boston Scientific, should be held liable for breaching a contract with J&J.J&J seeks in excess of $5 billion in damages and interest from Boston Scientific, a potentially massive judgment against a company that as of Tuesday had a market capitalization of $17.8 billion.The two-part trial before U.S. District Judge Richard Sullivan is expected to go into December as lawyers revisit the details, and the aftermath, of the nine-year-old Guidant battle. Underscoring the stakes, Boston Scientific has brought in well-known litigator David Boies. Johnson & Johnson will answer with a high-profile lawyer of its own, Sean Coffey, perhaps best known for winning a $6 billion judgment against big banks in the wake of WorldCom's collapse.The companies declined to comment ahead of the trial.Jefferies Group analyst Raj Denhoy said in a note that the case ""represents a major near-term risk"" for Boston Scientific. J&J and Guidant, which made cardiovascular devices, struck a deal to combine in 2004 and later agreed to a $21.5 billion price. To satisfy antitrust concerns, J&J said it would sell a portion of Guidant's business to Abbott Laboratories.The deal included a ""no-solicitation"" clause that prohibited Guidant from seeking better offers, though it was permitted to consider unsolicited bids.Before the merger closed, Boston Scientific made a $25 billion offer and also said it would sell assets to Abbott. J&J became convinced that Guidant had provided due diligence to Abbott as it worked on the Boston Scientific offer, in violation of its agreement. Without that move, J&J says, Abbott would not have signed on, leaving Boston Scientific unable to win what became a bidding war. Boston Scientific eventually bought Guidant for $27 billion, while J&J received a $705 million termination fee.J&J sued Guidant and Abbott in 2006, claiming breach of contract. Abbott has since been dismissed as a defendant.Boston Scientific plans to argue that Guidant did not knowingly violate the agreement, according to court papers.It has also questioned whether J&J can prove it lost money.

57,"   By Jessica Dye | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Boston Scientific Corp was ordered Thursday to pay $18.5 million for injuries caused by transvaginal mesh devices, a plaintiffs’ lawyer said, in the third courtroom loss for the company over the products. A jury in West Virginia federal court found the Massachusetts company liable to four women following a 10-day trial, according to their lawyer, Doug Monsour. The company was ordered to pay each of the four women damages ranging from $3.25 million to $4.25 million for the injuries. Jurors also said Boston Scientific had acted with “gross negligence” and awarded each woman $1 million in punitive damages, Monsour said. ""This jury, after carefully thinking about the evidence for two days, came to the proper decision that this was a defective product,"" Monsour said. Boston Scientific, whose shares fell 1.5 percent to $12.90, said in a statement that it disagreed with the verdict and was considering its appeals options.  The four plaintiffs say they suffered injuries such as pain during sex, nerve damage and infection as a result of the company’s Obtryx device, which is used to treat stress urinary incontinence. Their claims are among more than 24,000 in U.S. state and federal courts against Boston Scientific over mesh devices. Plaintiffs' lawyers said at trial that Boston Scientific failed to perform sufficient safety testing in its rush to bring mesh products to market. They accused the company of using polypropylene to make the devices despite warnings that it was not meant to be permanently implanted in humans, and neglecting to tell doctors and women about those risks. Boston Scientific has fought back against claims that the devices are defective or were to blame for the women's complications. Last week, a Miami federal jury returned a $26.7 million verdict against Boston Scientific following a trial involving claims from four women over its Pinnacle device for treating pelvic organ prolapse. It did not award punitive damages. Earlier, a jury in Texas ordered the company to pay $73 million, which was later reduced to $34 million, in another mesh trial. Boston Scientific, however, won its first two mesh trials in Massachusetts state court. Boston Scientific is among seven major defendants, also including C.R. Bard and Johnson & Johnson's Ethicon Inc, that together are facing more than 60,000 mesh lawsuits in federal court.

62,"   By Jessica Dye | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Boston Scientific Corp’s back-to-back losses in the first two federal trials over its transvaginal mesh devices could drive up the cost of resolving thousands of similar lawsuits, according to legal experts.On Thursday, a jury in West Virginia awarded four women $18.5 million for injuries they said were caused by the Massachusetts-based company’s Obtryx device for stress urinary incontinence, including $4 million for “gross negligence.” The verdict came one week after a Miami jury awarded $26.7 million to four women implanted with the company's Pinnacle device for pelvic organ prolapse.Particularly troubling for Boston Scientific – which faces more than 24,000 mesh claims in U.S. state and federal courts – were the large compensatory damages, experts said. Compensatory damages are generally a more reliable indication of how much similar claims are worth, and more difficult to reduce on appeal, than more subjective punitive awards, experts said. In the Miami trial, each woman received between $6.5 million and $6.7 million, while in West Virginia compensatory damages ranged from $3.25 million to $4.25 million. “This has to hurt,” said Howard Erichson, a Fordham Law School professor. After the verdicts, “the company has to be drawn to finding a way to settle the bulk of the remaining cases,” he said.  Unlike punitive damages, which punish wrongdoing, compensatory damages are tied to each plaintiff’s actual injuries - for instance, medical treatment or lost wages. While compensatory damages vary with each case, the fact that multiple juries have valued mesh claims at millions of dollars apiece is significant, experts said. The outcome of “bellwether,” or test, trials is not necessarily an indication that every woman will win her lawsuit. But early verdicts show both sides how juries value the cases - the data is critical in determining how much each claim could be worth in settlement. U.S. District Judge Joseph Goodwin in the Southern District of West Virginia, who oversees federal mesh cases, is trying to speed up that process by trying cases with multiple plaintiffs and ordering hundreds of suits to be prepared for trial as early as next year. Big verdicts put pressure on the company to increase settlement offers to keep cases from going before a jury, experts said. They ""absolutely send the message"" to companies to consider settling, said Erin Copeland, a lead trial lawyer for the Miami women.     Boston Scientific and fellow mesh defendants C.R. Bard and Johnson & Johnson’s Ethicon Inc – which are among seven companies hit with about 67,000 federal cases - have faced a handful of trials so far, winning some and losing others.  Boston Scientific previously said it will challenge the verdicts, and declined further comment on Friday. The company has $945 million in its litigation reserves, for settlement and defense costs, according to a recent U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing. There’s no magic number for how many verdicts it takes to reach a settlement. Endo International’s American Medical Systems announced recently it had set aside $1.6 billion to settle transvaginal mesh cases without any trials, whereas Merck tried nearly 20 cases over injuries linked to the painkiller Vioxx before reaching a $4.85 billion settlement.And, experts say, the endgame for large-scale mass litigation is almost always settlement. “Some sort of collective settlement is going to make sense for the plaintiffs, it’s going to make sense for the defendant, and it’s absolutely what the judge wants,” Erichson said.

63,"   By Joseph Ax | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Jan 21 For more than eight years, Johnson & Johnson has pursued billions of dollars in damages against Boston Scientific Corp after the latter won a controversial - and ultimately ill-fated - bidding war for device maker Guidant.Now the dispute lies in the hands of a federal judge after lawyers for both companies made final presentations on Wednesday at the close of a non-jury trial in New York federal court.J&J is seeking more than $7.2 billion in damages and interest from Boston Scientific as Guidant's successor, an amount that one analyst has characterized as a ""major near-term risk"" for a company with a market capitalization of about $19 billion as of Wednesday.U.S. District Judge Richard Sullivan, who oversaw the trial, did not indicate when he would rule.The dispute stems from 2005, when J&J agreed to buy Guidant for $21.5 billion. Under the deal, Guidant was permitted to consider unsolicited competing bids.In late 2005, Boston Scientific announced its intention to make an offer, which was contingent on selling some of Guidant's assets to Abbott Laboratories to satisfy antitrust concerns. J&J claims Guidant knowingly violated their contract by providing due diligence directly to Abbott. Without that breach, J&J argues, Abbott would have walked away from the deal, scuttling Boston Scientific's bid and leaving Guidant with no competing offers.""What made the breach material was that Boston Scientific was not going to make an offer if Abbott was not involved,"" said Harold Weinberger, a lawyer for J&J.David Boies, a lawyer for Boston Scientific, said Guidant relied on the advice of its attorneys in sharing information with Abbott. Boston Scientific eventually acquired Guidant for $27 billion and paid J&J a $705 million termination fee. The deal has since been widely panned as too expensive, prompting Boston Scientific to argue that J&J dodged a bullet by failing to complete the acquisition and cannot now claim any damages, even if a breach occurred.""They have not presented any evidence that they would have been better off,"" Boies said.Sullivan pressed both sides during more than two hours of closing arguments. At one point, he questioned why J&J did not aggressively challenge Guidant as soon as they became aware that Abbott had been given information in January 2006, instead of making subsequent higher bids.

64,"   By Joseph Ax | NEW YORK  NEW YORK For more than eight years, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) has pursued billions of dollars in damages against Boston Scientific Corp (BSX.N) after the latter won a controversial – and ultimately ill-fated – bidding war for device maker Guidant.Now the dispute lies in the hands of a federal judge after lawyers for both companies made final presentations on Wednesday at the close of a non-jury trial in New York federal court.J&J is seeking more than $7.2 billion in damages and interest from Boston Scientific as Guidant’s successor, an amount that one analyst has characterized as a “major near-term risk” for a company with a market capitalization of about $19 billion as of Wednesday.U.S. District Judge Richard Sullivan, who oversaw the trial, did not indicate when he would rule.The dispute stems from 2005, when J&J agreed to buy Guidant for $21.5 billion. Under the deal, Guidant was permitted to consider unsolicited competing bids.In late 2005, Boston Scientific announced its intention to make an offer, which was contingent on selling some of Guidant’s assets to Abbott Laboratories (ABT.N) to satisfy antitrust concerns. J&J claims Guidant knowingly violated their contract by providing due diligence directly to Abbott. Without that breach, J&J argues, Abbott would have walked away from the deal, scuttling Boston Scientific's bid and leaving Guidant with no competing offers.“What made the breach material was that Boston Scientific was not going to make an offer if Abbott was not involved,” said Harold Weinberger, a lawyer for J&J.David Boies, a lawyer for Boston Scientific, said Guidant relied on the advice of its attorneys in sharing information with Abbott. Boston Scientific eventually acquired Guidant for $27 billion and paid J&J a $705 million termination fee.The deal has since been widely panned as too expensive, prompting Boston Scientific to argue that J&J dodged a bullet by failing to complete the acquisition and cannot now claim any damages, even if a breach occurred. “They have not presented any evidence that they would have been better off,” Boies said.Sullivan pressed both sides during more than two hours of closing arguments. At one point, he questioned why J&J did not aggressively challenge Guidant as soon as they became aware that Abbott had been given information in January 2006, instead of making subsequent higher bids.“There’s a glaring absence of the sorts of emails and documents you would expect if you thought you had just been hosed on a multibillion-dollar deal,” he said.

72,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, February 17 (Fitch) Boston Scientific Corp.'s (NYSE: BSX) ratings are  unaffected by its recent settlement with Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) regarding  litigation associated with BSX's acquisition of Guidant in 2006, according to  Fitch Ratings.  The settlement calls for BSX to pay $600 million to JNJ during 2015. BSX will  make two $300 million dollar payments, primarily using balance sheet cash  without taking on any additional long-term debt. The agreement removes any  further litigation regarding this matter. While Fitch views the settlement as a positive development in terms of reducing  the uncertainty surrounding the potential financial liability from the lawsuit,  the $600 million dollar payment will reduce the availability of cash in the  short term. Nevertheless, Fitch believes that BSX will maintain adequate  liquidity through FCF generation, balance sheet cash and access to its revolving  credit facility. As such, BSX will be able to operate competitively with  expected improving operations and without stressing its balance sheet. In the lawsuit against BSX, JNJ alleged that Guidant knowingly violated their  acquisition agreement with JNJ by providing due diligence activities to Abbott  Laboratories (Abbott), particularly regarding its drug eluting stent platform.  JNJ stated that BSX would not have succeeded in acquiring Guidant, had Guidant  not provided that information to Abbott. Both sides presented their arguments in  U.S. District Court and were awaiting the judge's decision. The uncertainty  regarding the judge's ruling the prospects for a continued legal battle likely  helped motivate both sides to settle the dispute. The $600 million cash settlement is within the range of Fitch's forecasts and  was incorporated in the company's current credit rating. RATING SENSITIVITIES: Positive: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  positive rating action include the following: --Continued operational improvements that support long-term positive revenue  growth and margin stability/improvement; --An operational profile that could lead to significant and durable increases in  FCF; --Cash deployment policy and resulting capital structure that would durably  sustain leverage below 2.2 times (x)-2.3x. Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  negative rating action include the following:  --Material and lasting deterioration in operations and FCF; --Persistent increase in leverage approaching 3.0x; --Leveraging acquisitions without the prospect of timely debt/leverage  reduction; --Large legal settlement(s) that would need to be funded with significant debt  issuance(s). RATINGS: Fitch currently rates Boston Scientific Corp. as follows: --Long-term IDR 'BBB-'; --Unsecured bank credit facility 'BBB-'; --Senior unsecured notes 'BBB-'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.

Endo, which acquired AMS for $2.9 billion in 2011, reached an $830 million settlement last April to resolve legal claims from women who said they were injured by the company's transvaginal mesh devices. The purchase would end a nearly decade-long deal drought for Boston Scientific, which has not completed a large takeover since its 2006 acquisition of heart device maker Guidant Corp for $27 billion, which left the company laden with debt and dealing with a slew of Guidant product recalls.For Endo, the divestiture is part of an effort to sell non-core businesses and grow aggressively through new acquisitions.  Led by former Valeant Pharmaceuticals International (VRX.TO) executive and serial dealmaker Rajiv De Silva, Endo last October agreed to acquire Auxilium Pharmaceuticals Inc AUXL.O for $2.6 billion for its men's health drug portfolio.Endo also acquired generic drugmaker Dava Pharmaceuticals for $600 million last June. A $1.6 billion acquisition of Canadian specialty drugmaker Paladin Labs last year allowed the company to shift its tax domicile from Pennsylvania to Ireland, where corporate tax rates are lower, in a so-called inversion deal. Boston Scientific has largely sat on the sidelines amid a spate of large deals in the medical device sector in the last year, including Medtronic PLC's (MDT.N) $42.9 billion acquisition of Covidien and Zimmer Holdings Inc's ZMH.N acquisition of Biomet Inc for $13.4 billion.

82,"  (Adds background, shares)March 13 Boston Scientific Corp said on Friday that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved its device to prevent stroke in patients with a dangerous irregular heart rhythm known as atrial fibrillation (AF).The tiny umbrella-shaped product, called the Watchman Left Atrial Appendage Closure Device, is designed to spare patients with non-valvular AF a lifetime of taking anticoagulant drugs, such as warfarin, that carry a high risk of bleeding.The device will be made available to U.S. centers involved in Boston Scientific's clinical studies and additional specialized centers, the company said.The Watchman is implanted using a thin catheter and secured on the left atrial appendage, a thumb-sized muscular pouch connected to the left atrium of the heart. The product, which Boston Scientific acquired when it bought Atritech in 2011, captures clots, preventing them from being dislodged and moving to the brain.It has been commercially available in regions outside the United States since 2009. Last October, an advisory panel to the FDA offered a mixed view of the heart device, concluding it was safe, but not particularly effective. Still, the panel voted to say the product's benefits outweighed the risks, with some saying it should be an option for patients.The advisory panel had met twice before to discuss the product. In December 2013, it voted in favor of its safety and efficacy. However, follow-up clinical trial data showed an additional risk of ischemic stroke in patients who received the Watchman. The FDA is not obliged to follow the advice of its advisory panels but typically does so.People with AF, the most common type of arrhythmia, are five times more likely to suffer a stroke than those without the condition. AF currently affects more than five million Americans.The company's stock, which closed at $16.61 at the New York Stock Exchange on Friday, was marginally up in extended trading.Earlier this month, the medical device maker said it would buy Endo International Plc's urology portfolio for up to $1.65 billion.

85,"   By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed and Sinead Carew | NEW YORK, April 24  NEW YORK, April 24 Healthcare companies on a seven-year tear have been top performers so far in 2015, helping to push broad stock indexes to record levels, but traders are now looking to protect themselves from a selloff as they await major earnings reports in the sector.Companies reporting first-quarter earnings next week include Bristol-Meyers Squibb Co, Boston Scientific Corp , Merck & Co, Pfizer Inc, Gilead Sciences Inc and Celgene Corp.So far, companies that have reported in this sector have seen positive moves in share prices, and many investors say they think healthcare stocks have room to run.But options traders are not taking chances. Options on a key healthcare exchange-traded fund (ETF) are set near their most defensive posture ever.So far this year, the S&P healthcare sector index  has risen 8.7 percent, leading all other S&P sector indexes. Since 2008, it has increased 179 percent while the broader S&P 500 is up 135 percent. On Thursday, healthcare's strong performance helped push the S&P 500 to an intraday record and the Nasdaq composite index to its all-time closing high.Investors have been drawn to healthcare stocks by a spate of mergers and expectations for more buyouts on top of major drug launches and strong demand from an aging population. ""It's kind of tough to punch holes into the healthcare bull story,"" said Sven Borho, founding general partner at health specialist fund OrbiMed Advisors LLC, in New York.""What worries me is the long stretch of outperformance relative to the rest of the market,"" he said. Even so, ""it's not that healthcare valuations broadly have gone off the roof.""The sector is trading at 18.8 times earnings estimates for the year ahead compared to S&P's P/E ratio of 17.5. Traders in the options market, however, are preparing for possible downside. Activity in puts, which can be used to hedge against a drop in shares, has picked up noticeably in April for the Health Care Select Sector SPDR ETF.The average daily puts volume has risen to 16,000, from 9,000 for the first three months of 2015. For every call option, usually used for bullish bets, there are 4.6 put options open, the highest ratio since early 2007, right after their launch, according to options analytics firm Trade Alert.""It's really just a function of investors looking to protect their gains,"" said Max Breier, senior equity derivatives trader at BMO Capital Markets. ""In a market cap-weighted ETF like the XLV, if you get a number of the top-weighted names kind of disappointing at once you can get a pretty violent reaction,"" Breier said. Companies reporting next week include Bristol-Meyers Squibb Co, Boston Scientific Corp, Merck & Co, Pfizer Inc, Gilead Sciences Inc and Celgene Corp.Medical device maker Boston Scientific is the second-best S&P healthcare performer with a 39-percent share price gain so far this year. The most accurate analysts say it could meet earnings per share estimates for 20.4 cents per share or miss by a thread, according to StarMine.Gilead could beat analysts' $2.30 EPS estimate by over 22 cents while Bristol-Meyers and Celgene could beat their EPS estimates by about a penny, according to StarMine.Shares are more likely to react to comments about drug studies or pricing than to results, Borho said.Wall Street analysts expect the S&P healthcare sector to report a 10.2 percent first-quarter earnings increase, compared with 7.2 percent expected on April 1 and 12.4 percent in October, Reuters data showed.Other big events investors will watch next week include  first-quarter GDP numbers and the Federal Reserve's statement after its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday. Apple Inc  reports earnings on Monday afternoon in a week when oil companies are expected to report grim results.

86,"   By Susan Kelly  Boston Scientific Corp expects more hospitals will be able to offer its new atrial fibrillation treatment starting by the end of the third quarter as it paces the product's rollout to give physicians time to learn how to use it, its chief executive said.The device, called Watchman, was approved by U.S. regulators last month as an alternative to long-term use of blood thinners such as warfarin for patients at high risk of stroke. ""It is a big unmet need. There were many patients waiting for this to be approved in the United States,"" Boston Scientific CEO Mike Mahoney said Tuesday in an interview after the company reported first-quarter earnings.U.S. physicians have shown keen interest in the new treatment, according to several analyst surveys. It is the first of its kind and works by closing the left atrial appendage in the muscle wall of the heat's top left chamber.The company initially will make the device available to the 50 hospitals involved in its clinical trials before regulatory approval, Mahoney said. It is restricting access to allow enough time for physicians to get up to speed on the implant procedure.  ""It's tricky to manage,"" Mahoney said. ""A lot of big centers in the U.S. want it now, but unfortunately we are asking them to delay."" By the end of the third quarter, it plans to begin adding more hospitals toward a near-term goal of doubling the number of facilities that can implant the device to 100, Mahoney said.  ""We already have those sites identified, and they are aware of the timing,"" he said.More than 400 hospitals have the capabilities to perform the procedure and will qualify eventually, he added.  Atrial fibrillation is a relatively common disorder in which the heart's two upper chambers beat out of sync with the two lower chambers, increasing the risk for blood clots to form. It affects as many 2.7 million people in the United States, according to the American Heart Association.  Boston Scientific is projecting a $500 million market for the Watchman device within five years.    ""The demand is certainly high and the physician interest is high,"" Mahoney said.

94,"   By Jessica Dye  A Delaware jury on Thursday ordered Boston Scientific to pay $100 million to a woman who said she was injured by transvaginal mesh, a device that is the subject of more than 25,000 lawsuits against the company.Jurors awarded Deborah Barba $25 million in compensatory damages, and an additional $75 million in punitive damages, according to lawyers for Barba.The 51-year-old Newark, Delaware-resident was implanted with Boston Scientific's Pinnacle and Advantage Fit mesh products in 2009, to treat pelvic organ prolapse and stress urinary incontinence, according to her 2011 lawsuit. The devices caused serious complications, she said, and despite two subsequent surgeries to try to fix the problems, parts of the devices are still in her body, continuing to cause pain. Following a two-week trial, jurors deliberated for about seven hours before finding Boston Scientific had been negligent in designing and making the devices and that it had failed to warn patients and doctors about potential risks.Fidelma Fitzpatrick, one of Barba's lawyers, said Thursday that mesh complications had ""profoundly changed"" Barba's life, and that she hoped the size of the verdict would persuade Boston Scientific and other mesh makers to settle the remaining cases. A Boston Scientific spokeswoman said the company strongly disagreed with the verdict and intends to appeal.Thursday's verdict is the largest one yet in litigation over transvaginal mesh devices against Marlborough, Massachusetts-based Boston Scientific or any other mesh manufacturer. The company announced last month it had reached agreements to pay about $119 million to resolve 2,970 cases about transvaginal mesh. The verdict is the sixth so far against the company by women who say that the devices are poorly designed and use subpar materials, resulting in painful physical injuries such as bleeding, infection and pain during sex. Boston Scientific has denied that the products are defective or that it failed to warn about potential complications.Last year, Boston Scientific won the first two trials against it, before losing three in a row, including a $73.4 million verdict for a woman in Texas, which was later reduced to $34 million, and back-to-back trials involving groups of four women in West Virginia and Florida.Boston Scientific is among seven manufacturers that collectively face an estimated 100,000 lawsuits over transvaginal mesh devices in U.S. federal and state courts.

The devices caused serious complications, she said, and despite two subsequent surgeries to try to fix the problems, parts of the devices are still in her body, continuing to cause pain.Following a two-week trial, jurors deliberated for about seven hours before finding Boston Scientific had been negligent in designing and making the devices and that it had failed to warn patients and doctors about potential risks.   Fidelma Fitzpatrick, one of Barba's lawyers, said Thursday that mesh complications had ""profoundly changed"" Barba's life, and that she hoped the size of the verdict would persuade Boston Scientific and other mesh makers to settle the remaining cases. A Boston Scientific spokeswoman said the company strongly disagreed with the verdict and intends to appeal.  Thursday's verdict is the largest one yet in litigation over transvaginal mesh devices against Marlborough, Massachusetts-based Boston Scientific or any other mesh manufacturer. The company announced last month it had reached agreements to pay about $119 million to resolve 2,970 cases about transvaginal mesh. The verdict is the sixth so far against the company by women who say that the devices are poorly designed and use subpar materials, resulting in painful physical injuries such as bleeding, infection and pain during sex. Boston Scientific has denied that the products are defective or that it failed to warn about potential complications.  Last year, Boston Scientific won the first two trials against it, before losing three in a row, including a $73.4 million verdict for a woman in Texas, which was later reduced to $34 million, and back-to-back trials involving groups of four women in West Virginia and Florida.

101,"  (For more Reuters Special Reports, double-click on )By Alison Frankel and Jessica DyeNEW YORK Aug 18 In July 2013, California urogynecologist Andrew Cassidenti received an email from an entrepreneur named Otto Fisher, who had a proposition. Fisher was looking for surgeons to perform operations to remove pelvic mesh implants from women.Intrigued, Cassidenti responded. In a phone call, Fisher said he needed doctors to operate at outpatient centers in California and Las Vegas. Fisher said he could guarantee Cassidenti $2,500 for every surgery the doctor performed, ""whether it took five minutes or two hours,"" or even if the doctor did not remove any mesh, according to the surgeon's sworn court statement recounting the conversation.Cassidenti said the conversation made him suspicious. During the call, Fisher referred to litigation that is pitting tens of thousands of women against the makers of pelvic mesh.The devices, mostly made of plastic and varying in size and shape, have been surgically inserted into millions of women to treat urinary incontinence and other disorders. They are the target of about 100,000 suits in state and federal courts - the biggest onslaught of personal injury litigation since the asbestos battles of the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s.Fisher, the surgeon said, claimed that the federal judge overseeing the cases ""needs to see key phrases in the operative report,"" like ""defective mesh"" and ""mesh erosions."" Cassidenti asked if Fisher was trying to dictate what he should write about his patients.""No,"" Fisher told him. ""But it's just a game, and we have to play the game.""THE RISE OF A NEW INDUSTRY Fisher denies making those statements. Cassidenti told Reuters he stands by his affidavit.Unbeknownst to Fisher at the time of the call, Cassidenti was a consultant to device maker American Medical Systems. And AMS, along with device giants Johnson & Johnson, Boston Scientific and C.R. Bard, was one of the biggest defendants in the mesh cases.Cassidenti suspected he had stumbled onto a scheme to recruit doctors willing to overstate women's injuries from implants, thereby driving up awards in cases against mesh makers. He alerted AMS, which persuaded a judge to give it the power to subpoena documents and obtain testimony in an investigation of Fisher and the surgical lending company he was working with, MedStar Funding. The other major mesh makers launched probes, too.Previously undisclosed deposition transcripts from these investigations and Reuters interviews with mesh patients have provided rare details about a little-known business: investing in surgeries for injured plaintiffs. It's a practice that has become deeply entangled with medical device litigation.Medical funders, often working through go-betweens like Fisher or doctors' billing services, purchase medical bills at a deep discount from physicians, hospitals and others who have provided care to patients involved in personal injury litigation. Some medical funders also provide ""concierge care"" to these patients, fronting them travel and expense money at a high rate of interest.Patients who rely on medical funders tend to be poor. They either lack private insurance or can't afford to pay cash deductibles or out-of-network fees charged by their doctors.SQUEEZING TRACI RIZZO When a patient's lawsuit settles, the medical funder stakes a claim to part of the settlement by placing a lien for the full amount of the surgical bill. The funder's profit lies in the difference between what it pays the medical provider to buy the bill and what it is able to recover from the patient's settlement.These medical liens sometimes spiral to as much as 10 times what private insurers or government programs like Medicaid would pay for the same procedures. The standard insurance reimbursement for mesh removal surgery, for instance, ranges from about $2,000 to $7,000. Medical lenders have demanded as much as $62,000 for surgery and related services from patients whose care they funded.Mesh patients such as Traci Rizzo, a 42-year-old mother of three from Gulf Shores, Alabama, say they were not adequately informed by their funders, lawyers or physicians that liens could gut their payouts from defendants.Rizzo said her lender, MedStar, paid her surgeon, John Miklos, $17,000 for a mesh removal operation. A spokeswoman for Miklos declined to comment. Rizzo's health insurer, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Alabama, told Reuters it customarily pays doctors between $900 and $1,300 for the same surgery. MedStar and its affiliates then sought to charge Rizzo more than $60,000 for their services, according to documents Rizzo showed Reuters.""I don't begrudge anybody their share,"" said Rizzo. ""But when businesses are abusing already injured people, it is greedy, it is wrong and it shouldn't be allowed.""MedStar owner Daniel Christensen did not respond to requests for comment.A HISTORIC WAVE OF LITIGATION The medical funding industry is opaque and fragmented. It is composed almost entirely of small firms that guard such operational details as the identity of their investors, their revenue and the number of medical bills they buy each year.Most funders buy bills owed by uninsured or underinsured patients with slip-and-fall, car accident and workers compensation suits. But over the last several years, the business has evolved to include funding surgeries for patients involved in mass litigation over drugs and medical devices.Reuters could find no independent organization that tabulates the money spent on such lending. Faith Larson, managing director at litigation financier Javlin Capital in Omaha, Nebraska, estimated that lenders have invested as much as $100 million in health care for mass torts plaintiffs. These include patients suing over hip and knee replacements, intrauterine birth control devices and the anti-psychotic drug Risperdal.The sheer size of the litigation over pelvic mesh has lent momentum to the burgeoning business. Since 2008, women and their sexual partners have filed an estimated 100,000 suits against seven mesh manufacturers, alleging that dozens of devices were poorly designed and made from materials not intended to be implanted in the vaginal area.Plaintiffs blame mesh implants for injuries ranging from pain and bleeding during sex to organ damage and, in rare cases, death. Women with mesh have won multimillion-dollar verdicts in 10 of the 13 suits that have gone to trial against manufacturers since 2012. The vast majority of mesh cases, however, will never reach a jury. Defendants facing mass litigation almost always reach global settlements, in which they resolve hundreds or thousands of suits at a time.The first major mesh manufacturer to agree to a multi-case settlement, AMS, has put up about $1.6 billion to resolve claims by about 45,000 mesh patients. More recently, Boston Scientific agreed to pay $119 million to settle nearly 3,000 of the 26,000 mesh claims it faces. Based on those figures, the average mesh settlement is about $40,000 per patient. Boston Scientific says settlements vary, and averages shouldn't be extrapolated to all cases.Generally, plaintiffs lawyers and defendants in mass settlements establish a matrix to compensate patients, based on the extent and severity of their injuries. That system, according to defendants in many mass cases, gives a financial incentive to plaintiffs lawyers working on a contingency basis: It's in their interest to claim that their clients' injuries are severe enough to require corrective surgery.THOUSANDS OF SURGERIES Based on court records and interviews with funders, at least several hundred women with claims against mesh makers appear to have used medical lenders to fund surgery to remove their implants. And at least ""a couple hundred"" of those surgeries were funded by MedStar, the surgical lending company that spoke with Orange County surgeon Cassidenti about joining its network.That figure is contained in a 2014 deposition by MedStar founder Christensen, who is also a lawyer for plaintiffs in personal injury suits.The total number of mesh-removal surgeries involving medical funders could be much higher. In a different court filing, Christensen said that as many as 3,750 of the 125,000 medical bills MedStar purchased between 2008 and 2014 were related to mesh surgery. At his deposition he declined to provide more specific information.The mesh makers' investigations of Christensen also showed the range of ""concierge"" services, in addition to surgical funding, that he provided to plaintiffs and eventually charged as liens against their settlements.A Christensen company called Pharmacom Injury Meds paid for patients' drugs.His litigation lending company, Beacon Legal Funding, advanced cash to plaintiffs at high interest. Tracy Rizzo, for instance, borrowed $1,200 in April 2014. Beacon's term sheet on her loan said her debt would be $1,800 in a year and $2,650 in two years, putting the compound interest rate at about 50 percent a year.Yet another Christensen company, MedCare Managers, helped shepherd patients through the surgical funding process, tracking cases, filling out paperwork and collecting payments.A PUBLIC SERVICE Medical funders say they perform a valuable public service. They say they facilitate surgery and other treatment for patients who otherwise couldn't afford it. By guaranteeing surgeons revenue, they say, they give patients access to good doctors who don't want to wait years for bills to be paid from settlement proceeds.Lenders also say patients are fully informed that medical liens charged against their settlements may exceed what insurers would reimburse. They say their profits are a fair return for the risk they take in advancing money against a settlement that might never come.""Where else is the patient going to go?"" Otto Fisher, the broker who connects lenders with physicians and medical centers, told Reuters. ""The only way to get surgery with top doctors is medical funding."" Foes of the medical lending industry, including AMS and other device makers, have said in court filings that they believe funders may promote unnecessary surgery. They also claim lenders may be taking advantage of desperate and unsophisticated patients.""The plaintiff is the only one who cares"" about the size of the lien, ""and by the time she finds out, it's too late,"" said Mark Fischer, a Kentucky lawyer who represents insurers. ""It's outrageous.""Some aspects of this funding fall under state lending laws, but unlike banks or credit agencies, medical funders are not licensed or subject to industry-wide rules.REFERRED BY LAWYERS Traci Rizzo said she had never heard of medical funding until her lawyer suggested it.Rizzo received three mesh implants in 2007 to treat urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse, a condition in which her pelvic muscles could not hold her uterus in place. After the devices were implanted, she said, she suffered chronic bladder infections, pain in her lower back and hips, and pain during sex.In 2011, after seeing television ads targeting women with pelvic mesh, she signed a retainer agreement with Lee Murphy, a Texas-based law firm.Rizzo said a lawyer at Lee Murphy told her the standard treatment for her symptoms was surgery to remove the implants. The lawyer said that a famous mesh removal surgeon, Miklos, had an office near Rizzo's hometown of Atlanta. Rizzo asked if the doctor would accept the private health insurance she received through her husband's job as a yacht engine technician.The lawyer, according to Rizzo, suggested a different way to pay. Rizzo could work with a medical lending company. The lender would pay all of the surgical bills and let her avoid the deductible on her husband's insurance. It would even pay for Rizzo and her daughter to travel to Atlanta and stay in a hotel for a few days after the procedure.According to Rizzo, the lawyer told her she had such a strong claim that she would hardly notice when the funder took a cut of her eventual settlement.""It probably should have seemed suspicious, but it didn't,"" Rizzo said. ""I felt like, 'I'm going to the best doctor ever, and I'm not even going to dip into my settlement much because I have such a good case.'""James Lee of Lee Murphy declined to comment on Rizzo's case, citing attorney client confidentiality. Speaking generally, he said many women with mesh implants have no alternative but to use third-party funding.""None of the defective product manufacturers offer assistance for removal or revision of their defective products when it fails,"" he said in an email. ""Even today, with multiple verdicts finding these mesh products defective and the manufacturers liable, not one of the mesh defendants have helped any of the women absent a lawsuit and a settlement.""It isn't clear what direct benefit, if any, plaintiffs lawyers get from referring clients to medical lenders. But patients who undergo surgery can generate higher fees for their lawyers, because they typically receive larger settlements than plaintiffs who don't have devices removed or replaced. A lawyer who represents patients with Boston Scientific mesh devices said at a hearing in February that nearly half of the plaintiffs who received implants to treat incontinence did not have surgery to remove or repair the devices. But their suits account for just 10 percent of the estimated value of the litigation overall, the lawyer estimated.Rizzo talked to the company her lawyer recommended - MedStar affiliate MedCare Managers. She signed a contract giving her surgeon permission to sell his bill to a medical lender. In turn, the lender got the right to recover the entire cost of her care from any settlement Rizzo would receive.A VAGUE DISCLOSURE The three-page contract comprises about 2,000 words of legalese in small type. The only mention that Rizzo might have to hand over an outsize chunk of her settlement is an indirect one, a few paragraphs in:""PATIENT acknowledges that fees paid to medical providers vary depending upon the method of payment.... PATIENT further acknowledges that medical providers typically receive more for their services when paid by contractual arrangements, such as this, than if they were paid by health insurance companies, government programs such as Medicare or Medicaid, or by the patient in cash.""In separate contracts, Rizzo granted additional recovery rights to the MedStar affiliate Beacon Funding, which lent her money for travel and meals, and to Pharmacom, which paid for her medication. At the time, Rizzo said, she was not aware that all of these companies were owned by MedCare Managers' owner Christensen.She found out in early 2015, when she received notice that MedStar and its affiliates planned to bring liens totaling more than $60,000 against her.After pushing for details on the claims, Rizzo says, she calculated that the funder and its affiliates had spent about $21,000 for her surgery, drugs and related expenses.Documents reviewed by Reuters show MedStar's lien of about $60,000 was based on a bill Miklos submitted for Rizzo's surgery - nearly $37,000 - and an additional bill of nearly $20,000 from a company called Mayo Surgical LLC of Kennesaw, Georgia. It is not clear how MedStar acquired the Mayo Surgical bill. Mayo Surgical did not respond to requests for comment.As Rizzo saw it, MedStar's lien would generate nearly $40,000 in profit for the lender.MedStar and its affiliates ultimately agreed to cut their claim in Rizzo's case from more than $60,000 to about $32,500. Rizzo, whose health problems have worsened since her mesh revision surgery in 2013, said that is still too much.""BUY LOW, SELL HIGH OR HIGHER"" The mesh makers' investigation of Fisher, MedStar and the surgeons showed how their surgical lending network operated.Fisher's role was to sign up doctors and surgical centers. He received a finder's fee when those physicians sold a bill to MedStar, according to his deposition.A medical billing company called Physicians Surgical Group supplied mesh removal patients to the doctors Fisher lined up. PSG paid the physicians a flat fee of about $2,500 per surgery, according to Fisher's deposition.But the surgical bills PSG subsequently sold to MedStar were for a much higher amount - $20,000 or more, according to a court filing by mesh defendant Boston Scientific.MedStar purchased those bills from PSG at a discount with the intention of asserting the full amount as a lien against the patient's eventual settlement.""That's the game plan: Buy low, sell high or higher,"" Fisher said during his deposition.PSG, based in Boca Raton, Florida, did not respond requests for comment. The company was indicted in December on charges unrelated to medical funding. Federal prosecutors in Ohio accused PSG of participating in a conspiracy to dupe private insurers into paying for an experimental chiropractic treatment. The company has pleaded not guilty.A $500,000 SURGEON The mesh business was lucrative for Fisher and other members of the network. During his deposition, mesh manufacturers asserted that Fisher earned about $100,000 in fees just in MedStar-funded cases. Fisher didn't dispute that figure.Meanwhile, Georgia-based gynecologist Michael Hulse, who performed mesh removal surgeries funded by MedStar and two other medical lenders, said in a deposition that mesh surgery garnered him about $500,000.Hulse said in an interview that while he no longer works with Otto Fisher, he still works with other surgical funders as well as traditional insurers to perform mesh removals. ""The funding allows patients who would never get help otherwise to get help,"" he said.In an interview, Fisher said the mesh makers never proved their allegations that he encouraged unnecessary surgeries or coached physicians.""I never even knew the patients' names until after surgery,"" he said. Fisher also said he doubted that patients would subject themselves to unnecessary surgeries or that physicians would perform them.Fisher said he is out of the mesh business. So is MedStar, according to Christensen's 2014 deposition.""Who's going to send me a case now?"" Christensen said.

105,"   By Jessica Dye | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Oct 9 A Delaware judge on Friday said Boston Scientific should only have to pay $10 million to a woman originally awarded $100 million by a jury who found she was injured by transvaginal mesh, a device that is the subject of thousands of lawsuits.Judge Mary Johnston in New Castle County, Delaware, said that the damages awarded to plaintiff Deborah Barba in May - the largest ever in a trial involving transvaginal mesh - were ""grossly disproportionate to the injuries suffered and shock the court's conscience and sense of justice.""But Johnston denied Boston Scientific's bid to set aside the verdict altogether and order a new trial. While the jury had properly decided the company's liability, Johnston wrote in her ruling that the jury's award was too high, particularly in comparison with the other mesh trials, in which punitive damages awards spanned from $1.75 million to $7.76 million. Boston Scientific spokesman Tom Keppeler said the company intends to appeal the verdict because it believes there were factual and legal errors. A lawyer for Barba, Fred Thompson of Motley Rice, said he was not surprised the judge would scrutinize the size of the damages. While disappointed with the reduction, Thompson said he was pleased that Johnston upheld the jury's finding on Boston Scientific's liability and considered the decision a hurdle in what was expected to be a lengthy post-trial process.According to her 2011 lawsuit, Barba was implanted with Boston Scientific's Pinnacle and Advantage Fit mesh devices in 2009 to treat pelvic organ prolapse and stress urinary incontinence.

106,"   By Jessica Dye  A federal judge in California has sent back to state court 62 cases from women in 21 states who claim they were injured by Boston Scientific Corp's transvaginal mesh devices, saying the company had waited too long to remove the lawsuits to federal court. U.S. District Judge Beverly Reid O'Connell in the Central District of California said on Monday that Boston Scientific should have removed the cases within a year of when they were originally filed in a single multi-plaintiff complaint, and not after the claims were severed into individual lawsuits by a state-court judge in August.
