12,"   By Ross Kerber | BOSTON, Sept 4  BOSTON, Sept 4 Some notable fund managers are betting on solar energy shares, expecting a wave of industry consolidation and lower costs to pay off for the notoriously volatile industry.The optimists, a mix of specialized environmental managers and mainstream investors, are going against several trends, since solar companies have already had a sizeable run-up this year and more fund managers have been selling the stocks than buying them.That has not deterred Fidelity Growth Company Fund  manager Steve Wymer, who has been talking up the new competitiveness of solar power and has been steadily purchasing shares of panel maker First Solar Inc. Among mutual funds, his is now the largest holder of the stock.Solar plants coming online in 2019 will generate electricity for $119 per megawatt hour, according to estimates from the U.S. Department of Energy. That is still more costly than some new coal plants, projected to produce electricity at $96 an hour, but down sharply from the $396 the agency projected for solar in 2016 four years ago.The U.S. industry has benefited from federal subsidies and import tariffs, while concentrating on large-scale solar projects promising regular income. In addition, solar companies have done several deals allowing them to combine operations like manufacturing and installation.""The reason we're bullish is that solar has finally reached grid parity"" in many regions, said Ian O'Reilly, who helps run the Pioneer Global Ecology fund.BUYING IN  Since last year, O'Reilly's $1.5 billion Pioneer fund has become a significant holder of equipment makers SunEdison Inc  and SunPower Corp.Others who have cited falling costs as a reason to invest in solar stocks this summer include the managers of Royce Opportunity Fund. Another well-known solar backer is David Einhorn's closely watched Greenlight Capital hedge fund, now SunEdison's top investor.Andrew Cupps, president of Cupps Capital Management in Chicago, said his firm earlier this year had begun buying shares of SunPower and residential installer SolarCity Corp, whose largest shareholder and chairman is Tesla Motors Inc  Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk.Cupps praised the efficiency of SunPower's solar panels and said SolarCity's recent purchase of panel maker Silevo should help drive down costs. Shares of SunEdison tripled over the 12 months ended on Sept 3. The Market Vectors Solar Energy ETF is up 84 percent over that period, although the sector has been volatile and still remains below pre-financial crisis highs.PRICEY SHARES  Skeptics cite setbacks like the 2011 bankruptcy of U.S. government-backed panel maker Solyndra LLC, plus soaring North American oil and gas production that could diminish interest in renewables.The stocks also may be expensive. SunPower, for example, trades at 25 times expected earnings, about twice the multiples of some oil companies.As solar stock prices rose over the last year, U.S. mutual funds sold some of their shares of SunPower, SunEdison and First Solar, according to Thomson Reuters' Lipper unit. But the value of their stakes still increased, likely because some managers held steady the percentage of solar in their portfolios, said Lipper Americas Research head Jeff Tjornehoj.Lower solar costs reflect new technologies as well as cheap panels from Chinese manufacturers that have led to expanded U.S. import tariffs.Kevin Landis, manager of the Firsthand Alternative Energy Fund, expects the tariffs to offer only marginal benefits to the companies he owns, SunEdison, First Solar and SolarCity.A bigger help, he said, is that public utility commissions often allow electric rates to creep up to cover the costs of fossil fuels. That should bolster the competitive position of solar electric plants that do not have to buy costly fuel once they are built.For most solar stocks, Landis said, ""it's still right place, right time.""

13,"  First Solar Inc (FSLR.O) will not spin off its solar power plants into a separate, publicly traded entity as some of its competitors have done, its chief executive said on Thursday.The company's shares slid more than 6 percent after CEO Jim Hughes announced the decision on a conference call to discuss First Solar's third-quarter earnings.Several solar players, including SunEdison SUNE.N and NRG Energy (NRG.N), have bundled up solar assets and spun them off into vehicles known as 'yield cos.'These instruments own and operate solar assets that have long-term power contracts with utilities. That guarantees stable cash flows that are then paid out as dividends to investors or reinvested into new plants by the parent company.""We do not feel that we are missing either gross margin opportunities or market share capture opportunities because we do not have a yield co today,"" Hughes told analysts on the call. First Solar manufactures solar panels and also builds solar power plants, many of which it sells to power producers. The company will retain ownership of some of those projects even without a yield co, Hughes said.Also on the call, Hughes said First Solar had begun restarting several lines at its Malaysia solar panel factory and could increase production capacity by 46 percent next year. Demand for solar panels is poised to rise ahead of the expiration of a critical U.S. tax credit for solar projects at the end of 2016, and First Solar wants to be prepared to capture that demand, Hughes said.     First Solar, which is based in Tempe, Arizona, reported a quarterly profit of $88.4 million or 87 cents per share, compared with $195 million, or $1.94 per share, a year ago.Excluding a one-time tax benefit, First Solar earned 61 cents a share. Analysts, on average, had been expecting earnings of 64 cents per share, excluding one-time items, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Revenue was $889.3 million.

16,"   By Ross Kerber | BOSTON  BOSTON One of Fidelity Investments' top stock pickers said on Wednesday that he remains positive on solar power despite a drop in oil prices that hurt shares of First Solar Inc and dragged on his portfolio's performance.Steven Wymer, who runs the $42.3 billion Fidelity Growth Company Fund, is the biggest fund investor in First Solar, a large maker of photovoltaic panels for power systems. Still, his fund's 6.80 percent total return in the fourth quarter beat the 4.93 percent advance of the Standard & Poor's 500 Index. ""While solar fundamentals are largely unrelated to oil prices, the drop in oil prices weighed on investors' sentiment toward energy sources in general, including alternatives such as electricity-generating solar operators and their suppliers,"" Wymer wrote in a quarterly update for investors posted to Fidelity's website on Wednesday.""We're still positive on the potential for solar as a secular theme, and the fund remained invested in First Solar at quarter-end,"" Wymer added.

25,"  NEW DELHI India will struggle to hit its ""hugely ambitious"" renewable energy target if it fails to make more land available for plants and ensure utilities have the means to buy in clean energy, the head of U.S.-based First Solar said on Sunday.Prime Minister Narendra Modi has made renewable energy a priority for his government, as he looks to leverage the falling cost of solar power - expected to reach parity with conventional energy by 2017 - and address India's chronic power shortages.First Solar Chief Executive Jim Hughes said he welcomed the government's commitment to develop 100,000 megawatts (MW) of solar power by 2022 - a 33-fold rise from today's level - but that in some Indian states there were question marks over the financial viability of solar schemes.""It makes it difficult to develop projects in these circumstances,"" Hughes told Reuters in an interview in New Delhi.First Solar, based in Tempe, Arizona, makes solar panels and also builds solar power plants, many of which it sells to power producers. Opening India's first major renewable energy conference on Sunday, Modi said clean energy was an ""article of faith"" for him.  Analysts have said Modi's targets will be difficult to reach given the poor financial health of mostly state-run electricity distribution companies that would buy solar energy, and the slow pace at which land for plants is made available.First Solar said on Sunday it planned to develop 5,000 MW of solar in India by 2019, while U.S. rival SunEdison announced plans to build 15,200 MW of solar and wind power by 2022. Hughes said First Solar needed to secure land, agree financing and reach power purchase agreements with buyers before building the capacity.     Its commitments follow recent pledges to launch new solar plants by domestic companies like Adani Enterprises and Essel Group.""India has a critical need to add capacity to its grid as it continues to experience strong economic growth and growing demand for energy,"" said Pashupathy Gopalan, president of SunEdison Asia-Pacific.India wants to raise its energy mix from renewables to 15 percent in 10 to 12 years from 6 percent now, Power Minister Piyush Goyal told the conference in Delhi on Sunday.       Total installed photovoltaic solar capacity globally stood at 135,000 MW at the end of 2013, according to First Solar. India's largest lender, the State Bank of India, said it would bankroll 15,000 MW of solar power by 2020. The SBI did not disclose the size of the financing package but 1,000 MW of solar typically costs about $1 billion. One MW can power roughly 1,000 U.S. homes, although this varies widely, depending on the amount of heating or cooling needed. (Reporting by Krishna N.

SunEdison Inc in July became the first solar company to bundle and spin off some of its power plants into a vehicle known as 'yield co', which earns money through long-term contracts with utilities. Renewable energy firm NRG Energy Inc  spun off its yield co in 2013.The cash flows give the parent company access to funds that are cheaper than taking a loan and promises investors regular dividend payouts.""Many investors were starting to believe that maybe an yield co won't come from the likes of SunPower and First Solar,"" S&P Capital IQ analyst Angelo Zino said. ""... You'll likely probably see more yield co offerings here in the coming quarters as a result.""Shares of SunPower, which also reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit on Tuesday, jumped as much as jumped 19 percent. First Solar's stock rose 17 percent.Share of other solar companies such as Trina Solar Ltd  and Canadian Solar Inc rose between 3-12 percent on Tuesday. SunPower, majority owned by French energy giant Total SA , expects to file with U.S. regulators by the end of the current quarter to spin off the new company, Chief Executive Tom Werner said on a conference call on Tuesday.SunPower, the second-largest U.S. solar panel maker, had been investing heavily to build new solar plants to counter competitive pricing of modules by Chinese manufacturers.Strong demand from utilities for electricity from such plants helped SunPower's fourth-quarter adjusted earnings of 26 cents per share beat analysts' average estimate of 24 cents.But the revenue stream from such plants have been choppy, hurting profits, and SunPower said in November it would ramp production of solar modules to counter the unpredictability.The company said on Tuesday it was withdrawing its full-year forecast, announced in November, to take into account the venture with First Solar.
