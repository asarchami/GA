0,"  (Adds comments from Lincoln global chief, paragraphs 5-7. 18-19)By Norihiko ShirouzuBEIJING, April 17 Ford Motor Co's premium brand Lincoln may be late to China's luxury boom, but its top executives say the upscale car market still has plenty of steam left for growth to make its debut later this year worthwhile.John Lawler, head of Ford's China operations, said on Thursday that the Dearborn, Michigan, automaker plans to open eight Lincoln retail outlets in seven Chinese cities including Beijing and Shanghai starting in October. Ford aims to boost the number of stores to 60 and push into a total of some 50 cities by 2016.Lawler would not provide a forecast for volume.He told Reuters in an interview earlier this week that Ford was ""excited about the potential opportunity"" in China, which he said was poised to displace the United States as the world's biggest luxury auto market by 2020.Matt VanDyke, Lincoln's global director, said in Dearborn last week that the marketing challenge will be to get Chinese consumers more familiar with the brand they are positive about and see as ""prestigious.""Chinese luxury vehicle consumers ""don't know exactly what our products are, other than presidential limousines and sometimes Navigators."" Lincoln limousines for decades ferried U.S. presidents about, including Richard Nixon during his historic 1972 visit to China. The Navigator is a large SUV that until about a decade ago was a top-seller and money maker for Ford in the U.S. market. Lincoln will introduce a refreshed Navigator in China, VanDyke said.Some companies forecast the volume of upscale cars costing more than $50,000 in China to total nearly 3 million vehicles a year by 2020.Demand for premium cars in China has surged in recent years.""The market might not grow at the same pace as before, but we still think there is a lot of growth left. The party isn't quite over yet,"" Lawler said. STIFF, ESTABLISHED COMPETITION Still, Lincoln's timing for a China entry, along with that of other recently launched luxury car brands such as Nissan Motor Co's Infiniti and the Honda Motor Co's  premium brand Acura, is less than perfect.After well over a decade in China, three German premium brands, Audi, BMW and Mercedes-Benz , dominate the country's marketplace. What's more, a victim of its own recent success, the Chinese luxury auto market has become a hyper-competitive battleground. Five years ago, there were fewer than a dozen luxury car models sold under five premium brands. Today, that has exploded to more than 90 models offered by 25 brands, according to market research firm TNS.Lawler, however, said rapidly changing profiles of Chinese customers give an opening for Lincoln.Before, the market was so new and consumers were so inexperienced that it was ""all about the panache of the product, and the (social) statement it made,"" Lawler said. ""You went into the store and you paid whatever the price because price didn't really matter.""Now, luxury cars such as the Lincoln MKZ sedan and the MKC crossover SUV, which Ford begins selling in China later this year, are more than transactions to a newer breed of customers in China. Ford will add the Navigator to those stores next year.""They're less about conspicuous consumption. They're really about experience and personalized service and enjoying luxury from every element - not just the product but the whole experience,"" Lawler said.VanDyke said Lincoln will try to win over customers with a ""huge emphasis on client experience"" and service.""Culturally there's a high degree of mistrust about what happens with service and if you take your car in for a service are you getting factory authorized parts,"" said VanDyke. ""So, we're going to be extremely transparent about how we conduct the service.""

1,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, May 02 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Lincoln National  Corporation's (LNC) Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A-', and the  Insurer Financial Strength (IFS) ratings of LNC's insurance operating  subsidiaries at 'A+'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. A full list of rating  actions follows at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS Today's rating actions reflect LNC's solid overall operating performance, strong  risk-adjusted capitalization, excellent competitive position, diverse  distribution network and capable management team. LNC's ratings also reflect the  above-average exposure of its earnings and capital to interest rates and the  performance of equity markets and above-average financial leverage.  LNC reported operating earnings of $1.38 billion in 2013, up from $1.28 billion  in 2012. For the first quarter of 2014, operating earnings were $365 million, up  from $285 million for the same period in 2013 driven primarily by growing fee  income due to higher account values. The company's account values have benefited  in recent years from a combination of strong equity market performance and  robust net flows. LNC's operating performance continues to be constrained by  persistently low interest rates, but recent increases in rates have begun to  reduce the effects of spread compression in the company's large block of  spread-based business. Lower spreads have been offset over the past year by  strong sales and equity market performance, which have bolstered asset-based fee  income on rising account values.  Fitch considers LNC's statutory capital adequacy to be strong and above  expectations for the company's current rating. Statutory total adjusted capital  (TAC) of LNC's insurance operating subsidiaries was $8.0 billion at Dec. 31,  2013, up from $7.6 billion at Dec. 31, 2012. Reported risk-based capital (RBC)  ratio of 501% at year-end 2013 was up from 488% at year-end 2012. The use of  captive reinsurance associated with LNC's excess life reserves and variable  annuity guarantees benefits the level of reported RBC in the case of excess life  reserves, and benefits the stability of reported RBC in the case of variable  annuity guarantees. These benefits continue to be factored into Fitch's view of  LNC's statutory capitalization. Fitch's concern about LNC's significant equity market exposure reflects  above-average exposure to variable annuity business. While LNC has in place a  hedging program that has been effective in mitigating the risk associated with  this business, Fitch remains concerned about capital and earnings volatility for  large variable annuity writers in an unexpected, but still plausible, severe  stress scenario. Fitch also remains concerned about the reserve funding challenges and pricing  risk LNC will continue to face in connection with its exposure to no-lapse  guarantee universal life (UL) insurance. However, Fitch notes that LNC has made  considerable progress in recent years in lengthening the term of financing used  to back these reserves. Currently, LNC uses a combination of letter of  credit-supported reserve financing provided by affiliated reinsurance companies  and other structured solutions supported by LNC's issuance of long-term senior  notes. As of Dec. 31, 2013, Lincoln's financial leverage stood at 29%, which was near  the high end of Fitch's expectation of between 25% and 30% for the company's  current rating level. Following the repayment of $500 million in debt maturities  in the first quarter 2014, financial leverage declined to 26% at March 31, 2014.  Fitch anticipates that LNC will continue to reduce its financial leverage over  the next 12-18 months through a combination of the repayment of maturing debt,  growth in shareholders' equity, and other strategies to lower its interest  expense. Lincoln National Corp., headquartered in Radnor, PA, markets a broad range of  insurance and asset accumulation products and financial advisory services  primarily to the affluent market segment. The company reported consolidated  assets of $242 billion and common equity of $14.5 billion at March 31, 2014.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Key rating triggers that may precipitate a rating upgrade include: --Prolonged strong operating performance generating EBIT interest coverage in  excess of 10x; --Reported RBC above 450%; --Trend of holding-company liquidity managed at 12-18 months of debt service and  common stock dividends; --Leverage maintained below 25%. Conversely, key rating triggers that may lead to a rating downgrade include: --Capital below expectations for a prolonged period. Fitch would expect reported  RBC of 400% under normal conditions and 325% under stressed conditions; --Leverage maintained above 30% and Total Financing and Commitments ratio above  1.5x; -- LNC's GAAP-based interest coverage remains below 5x for an extended period of  time; --Cash coverage at holding company below 1.0x interest/dividend needs; --A material reserve increase or impairment of intangibles. Fitch has affirmed the following ratings with a Stable Outlook: Lincoln National Corporation --Long-term IDR at 'A-'; --Short-term IDR at 'F2'; --Commercial Paper at 'F2'; --4.30% senior notes due June. 15, 2015 at 'BBB+'; --7% senior notes due March 15, 2018 at 'BBB+'; --8.75% senior notes due July 1, 2019 at 'BBB+'; --6.25% senior notes due Feb. 15, 2020 at 'BBB+'; --4.85% senior notes due June 24, 2021 at 'BBB+ --4.20% senior notes due March 15, 2022 at 'BBB+'; --4.00% senior notes due Sept. 1, 2023 at 'BBB+'; --6.15% senior notes due April 7, 2036 at 'BBB+'; --6.3% senior notes due Oct. 9, 2037 at 'BBB+'; --7% senior notes due June. 15, 2040 at 'BBB+'; --7% junior subordinated debentures due May 17, 2066 at 'BBB-'; --6.05% junior subordinated debentures due April 20, 2067 at 'BBB-'.

5,"  Since Nebraska joined the conference prior to the 2011-12 season, Lincoln is one of three Big Ten cities that Indiana has visited over the past three years and been unable to conquer. The Hoosiers, who will attempt to right that wrong on Wednesday when they visit the Cornhuskers, have lost in each of their last two trips to Wisconsin, Illinois and Nebraska. The setbacks to the Cornhuskers have been particularly painful as the Hoosiers have squandered double-digit leads both times.Indiana, which will play its first true road game Wednesday, fell to 1-2 away from home on Saturday when it suffered a 91-87 overtime loss to Georgetown at Madison Square Garden in New York. Little has come easy for Nebraska lately at home, however, after it needed double overtime to knock off Cincinnati on Dec. 13 in Lincoln after dropping consecutive games in Pinnacle Bank Arena for the first time in the building’s two-year history. The Cornhuskers spent the holidays in Hawaii, defeating Loyola Marymount and Ohio on Christmas Day after losing to the host Rainbow Warriors in the opening round.TV: 5:30 p.m. ET, Big Ten NetworkABOUT INDIANA (10-3): Buoyed by Yogi Ferrell (47.5 percent) and impressive freshman James Blackmon Jr., (44.3), the Hoosiers rank 12th in Division I in 3-pointers per game (9.3) and seventh in long-range accuracy (41.7 percent). Due in large part to Ferrell and Blackmon, the Hoosiers have drained at least seven triples in every game this season after doing so only eight times in 32 contests in 2013-14. Troy Williams (13.6 points, six rebounds), who is coming off a career-high 23-point effort and is averaging 17.7 and 8.3 rebounds over his last three games, has scored in double figures in all but one contest this season. ABOUT NEBRASKA (8-4): Walter Pitchford has seen his minutes and production increase over the last four contests. After averaging 6.4 points and 2.9 rebounds in 21.6 minutes through the first eight games, the 6-10 forward has posted 9.5 points and 8.3 rebounds per game while logging 161 of a possible 175 minutes since. Nebraska has watched its turnovers spike over the last year as the Cornhuskers ranked fourth in the Big Ten and 52nd in the country last season with 10.9 turnovers, but rank last in the conference and tied for 289th in the country with 15 per game this season.TIP-INS  1. Nebraska (Terran Petteway, 19.3; Shavon Shields, 17.2) and Indiana (Blackmon, 17.9; Ferrell, 17.2) possess four of the top seven scorers in the Big Ten. 2. The Cornhuskers have held seven of their 12 opponents under 40 percent shooting, including each of their last four.3. The Hoosiers hit 121 3-pointers during non-conference action, nearly twice as many as they made in non-league games a season ago (64).PREDICTION: Nebraska 63, Indiana 60",2014-12-31,LNC,"Wed Dec 31, 2014 | 6:02am EST",Preview: Indiana at Nebraska,http://www.reuters.com//article/bkc-indiana-nebraska-preview-idUSMTZEACVG43JWN20141231?type=companyNews
6,"   By Bernie Woodall | DETROIT  DETROIT Jan 5 BMW on Monday regained bragging rights as the top-selling luxury brand in the United States, ending the one-year reign of German rival Mercedes.BMW ended with a lead last year of more than 9,000 vehicles over Mercedes-Benz, which in 2013 seized a title BMW had held for the previous two years.The BMW brand sold 339,738 vehicles in the U.S. market last year, a 9.8 percent jump from 2013. BMW's sales growth outpaced the overall U.S. auto market's 5.9 percent increase. Daimler AG's Mercedes-Benz brand showed an increase of 5.7 percent to 330,391 vehicles. Last year, Mercedes-Benz outsold BMW by about 3,000 vehicles. BMW won the sales crown in 2011 and 2012.Toyota Motor Corp's Lexus brand narrowed the gap on the two German brands, but remained in third last year with 311,389 vehicles, up 13.7 percent. From 2000 to 2010, Lexus was the luxury sales leader, but the two German brands jumped the Japanese brand in 2011 when a damaging earthquake and tsunami struck Japan. Volkswagen AG's Audi brand overtook General Motors Co's Cadillac for fourth place. Audi's sales of 182,011 were up 15.2 percent while Cadillac sales fell 6.5 percent to 170,750 vehicles.Honda Motor Co's Acura brand showed a 1.5 percent gain in the year to 167,843 vehicles, followed by Nissan Motor Co's Infiniti at 117,300 vehicles, up 0.8 percent.In eighth place but gaining was Lincoln, the Ford Motor Co  luxury brand that a couple of decades ago was the luxury market leader. Lincoln's sales rose 15.6 percent in the year to 94,474 vehicles.

7,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, February 11 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Lincoln National  Corporation's (LNC) Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A-', and the  Insurer Financial Strength (IFS) ratings of LNC's insurance operating  subsidiaries at 'A+'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. A full list of rating  actions follows at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS Today's rating actions reflect LNC's solid overall operating performance, strong  reported risk-adjusted capitalization, excellent competitive position, diverse  distribution network and capable management team. LNC's ratings also reflect the  above-average exposure of its earnings and capital to interest rates and the  performance of equity markets. LNC reported pre-tax operating earnings of $2 billion in 2014, up from $1.63  billion in 2013, driven primarily by growth in asset-based fee income due to  higher account values. The company's account values have benefited in recent  years from a combination of strong equity market performance and robust net  flows. LNC's operating performance continues to be constrained by persistently  low interest rates, but the company continues to reduce the effects of spread  compression from lower portfolio yields through reductions in interest crediting  rates.  Fitch considers LNC's reported statutory capital adequacy to be strong and above  expectations for the current rating. The company expects to report statutory  total adjusted capital (TAC) of $8.8 billion as of year-end 2014, up from $8  billion at year-end 2013. Growth in LNC's TAC has resulted in strong risk-based  capital (RBC) ratios, which the company expects at year-end 2014 to be 508% and  reported at year-end 2013 at 501%. The use of captive reinsurance associated  with LNC's excess life reserves and variable annuity guarantees benefits the  level of reported RBC in the case of excess life reserves, and supports the  stability of reported RBC in the case of variable annuity guarantees. These  benefits continue to be factored into Fitch's view of LNC's statutory  capitalization. Fitch remains concerned about ongoing low interest rates and the effect this has  on LNC's reserves, capital and earnings profile.  Fitch views LNC as having  above-average exposure to interest rates given its market-leading position in  universal life (UL) with no-lapse guarantees. Fitch's concern about LNC's significant equity market exposure reflects  above-average exposure to variable annuity business. While LNC has in place a  hedging program that has been effective in mitigating the risk associated with  this business, Fitch remains concerned about capital and earnings volatility for  large variable annuity writers in an unexpected, but still plausible, severe  stress scenario. Lincoln National Corp., headquartered in Radnor, PA, markets a broad range of  insurance and asset accumulation products and financial advisory services  primarily to the affluent market segment. The company reported consolidated  assets of $253 billion and common equity of $15.7 billion at Dec. 31, 2014. RATING SENSITIVITIES Key rating triggers that may precipitate a rating upgrade include: --Prolonged strong operating performance generating EBIT interest coverage in  excess of 10x; --Reported RBC above 450%; --Trend of holding-company liquidity managed at 12-18 months of debt service and  common stock dividends; --Leverage maintained below 25%. Conversely, key rating triggers that may lead to a rating downgrade include: --Capital below expectations for a prolonged period. Fitch would expect reported  RBC of 400% under normal conditions and 325% under stressed conditions; --Leverage maintained above 30% and Total Financing and Commitments ratio above  1.5x; -- LNC's GAAP-based interest coverage remains below 5x for an extended period of  time; --Cash coverage at holding company below 1x interest/dividend needs; --A material reserve increase or impairment of intangibles.

10,"   By David Shepardson  Jan 12 Ford Motor Co unveiled on Tuesday a new luxury flagship full-size Continental sedan aimed at Chinese and American consumers.""We're not trying to out-German the Germans or try to be like anyone else,"" Ford Chief Executive Mark Fields told reporters at the Detroit auto show, declining to forecast sales volume for the revival of the Continental, a model that was discontinued in 2002.Ford's U.S. luxury sales have lagged those of foreign competitors including BMW AG and Daimler AG's  Mercedes-Benz unit. Until the 1990s, Lincoln along with General Motors Co's Cadillac were far and away the U.S. luxury sales leaders.Fields said Ford has made ""meaningful progress and significant momentum"" in reviving the Lincoln brand. Ford showed a concept version of the Continental last April.The Dearborn, Michigan-based automaker considered shuttering Lincoln in 2010, when it announced it would kill its Mercury brand. But Fields has made turning around Lincoln a key priority. In 2014, Ford said it hoped to triple Lincoln's global sales by 2020 to 300,000 vehicles globally, from 100,000 in 2013.Lincoln's U.S. sales rose 7.1 percent last year to 101,227, the first time since 2008 they topped 100,000. Still that's about half the luxury automaker's record U.S. sales of more than 200,000 in 1990. Ford sold about 11,000 Lincoln vehicles in China last year, which was its first full year on sale in China. To attract more Chinese buyers, many who have drivers, Lincoln is offering Continental versions with enhanced backseat comfort and features including greater connectivity.The new Continental will be built in Flat Rock, Michigan, and goes on sale in the fall in both China and the United States.The new car is slightly smaller and lower than the flagship it replaces, the MKS. It is about a foot lower in the rear than the MKS.There some 1.7 million large luxury sedans sold in 2015, and that will grow to about 1.9 million by 2020, said Eric Turner, U.S. Lincoln brand manger, primarily fueled by growth in China. About 400,000 large luxury sedans were sold in the U.S. market.

11,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, January 15 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Lincoln National  Corporation's (LNC) Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A-', and the  Insurer Financial Strength (IFS) ratings of LNC's insurance operating  subsidiaries at 'A+'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. A full list of rating  actions follows at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS Today's rating actions reflect LNC's good overall operating performance, strong  reported risk-adjusted capitalization, excellent competitive position, diverse  distribution network and capable management team. LNC's ratings also reflect the  above-average exposure of its earnings and capital to interest rates and to the  performance of equity markets. Fitch considers LNC's operating performance track record to be good. In recent  years, earnings growth has been driven primarily by increased asset-based fee  income due to higher account values. The company's account values have benefited  from a combination of strong equity market performance and robust net flows.  However, earnings declined in the first nine months of 2015 due to elevated  mortality experience and an unfavorable interest rate related charge to deferred  acquisition costs (DAC), which negatively affected earnings primarily from the  Life Insurance segment. The charge to DAC was associated with the company's  annual third quarter review of actuarial assumptions. Aside from the elevated mortality and DAC charge, operating performance was as  expected, including improvement in the group protection segment over the second  and third quarters of 2015, which has had varied results in the past. Fitch  expects earnings for FY 2016 to improve from 2015 levels given more normalized  performance in life insurance and continued improvement in group protection.  LNC's operating performance continues to be pressured by persistently low  interest rates, but the company continues to reduce the effects of spread  compression from lower portfolio yields through reductions in interest crediting  rates.  LNC's interest coverage metrics have generally improved over the past several  years. Statutory interest coverage improved to 5.4x in 2015 from 3.1x in 2014.  GAAP interest coverage also improved to 9.9x in 2014 compared to 8.7x and 7.4x  in 2013 and 2012, respectively. GAAP interest coverage decreased to 8.0x for the  first three quarters of 2015 due to elevated mortality and the charge to DAC as  mentioned above. Fitch considers the decline in 2015 to be non-recurring and  expects GAAP interest coverage levels to improve assuming more normalized  mortality experience in 2016.  Fitch considers LNC's reported statutory capital adequacy to be strong and above  expectations for the current rating. Total adjusted statutory capital of LNC's  insurance operating subsidiaries increased approximately 10% in 2014 to  approximately $8.8 billion. Growth in LNC's statutory capital has been key to an  improvement in its reported RBC ratio over 2013 to 2014, which improved from  501% of the company action level at year-end 2013 to 541% at year-end 2014. As  of third quarter 2015, statutory capital declined 6% to $8.3 billion primarily  as a result of higher dividends paid from the operating insurance entities to  the holding company. The company continues to remain well above its target RBC  ratio of 400% under a stressed scenario.  The use of captive reinsurance associated with LNC's excess life reserves and  variable annuity guarantees benefits the level of reported RBC in the case of  excess life reserves, and supports the stability of reported RBC in the case of  variable annuity guarantees. These benefits continue to be factored into Fitch's  view of LNC's statutory capitalization. Fitch remains concerned about ongoing low interest rates and their effect on  LNC's reserves, capital and earnings profile. Fitch views LNC as having  above-average exposure to interest rates given its market-leading position in  universal life (UL) with no-lapse guarantees. Fitch's concern about LNC's significant equity market exposure reflects  above-average exposure to variable annuity business and associated guarantees.  However, Fitch believes that LNC has established a strong track record of  effectively managing this business, and has generated consistently favorable  results relative to peers. The company's results have benefited from relatively  conservative product design and pricing, and a comprehensive hedging program  that has effectively mitigated reserve volatility. Fitch remains concerned about  capital and earnings volatility for large variable annuity writers in an  unexpected, but still plausible, severe stress scenario. Given recent weakness  in equity market performance, Fitch expects moderate pressure on LNC's  asset-based fee income in 2016. Lincoln National Corp., headquartered in Radnor, PA, markets a broad range of  insurance and asset accumulation products and financial advisory services  primarily to the affluent market segment. The company reported consolidated  assets of $250 billion and common equity of $14.4 billion at Sep. 30, 2015. RATING SENSITIVITIES Key rating triggers that may precipitate a rating upgrade include: --Prolonged strong operating performance generating EBIT interest coverage in  excess of 10x; --Reported RBC above 450%; --Trend of holding-company liquidity managed at 12-18 months of debt service and  common stock dividends; --Leverage maintained below 25%. Conversely, key rating triggers that may lead to a rating downgrade include: --Capital below expectations for a prolonged period. Fitch would expect reported  RBC of 400% under normal conditions and 325% under stressed conditions; --Leverage maintained above 30% and Total Financing and Commitments ratio above  1.5x; --GAAP-based interest coverage remaining below 5x for an extended period of  time; --Cash coverage at holding company below 1.0x interest/dividend needs; --A material reserve increase or impairment of intangibles. Fitch has affirmed the following ratings with a Stable Outlook: Lincoln National Corporation --Long-term IDR at 'A-'; --Short-term IDR at 'F2'; --Commercial Paper at 'F2'; --7% senior notes due March 15, 2018 at 'BBB+'; --8.75% senior notes due July 1, 2019 at 'BBB+'; --6.25% senior notes due Feb. 15, 2020 at 'BBB+'; --4.85% senior notes due June 24, 2021 at 'BBB+ --4.20% senior notes due March 15, 2022 at 'BBB+'; --4.00% senior notes due Sept. 1, 2023 at 'BBB+'; --3.35% senior notes due March 9, 2025 at 'BBB+'; --6.15% senior notes due April 7, 2036 at 'BBB+'; --6.3% senior notes due Oct. 9, 2037 at 'BBB+'; --7% senior notes due June. 15, 2040 at 'BBB+'; --7% junior subordinated debentures due May 17, 2066 at 'BB+'; --6.05% junior subordinated debentures due April 20, 2067 at 'BB+'.
