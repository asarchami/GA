0,"  HCA Holdings Inc (HCA.N), the largest U.S. hospital operator, said on Tuesday that fourth-quarter earnings rose from a year ago as it generated more revenue from patients despite a decline in admissions to its facilities.U.S. hospitals have seen admissions decline during the economic downturn as people who lacked health insurance or faced higher out-of-pocket expenses avoided seeking medical care. The health reform law and its insurance exchanges are expected to benefit the industry this year by expanding insurance availability to more patients.HCA said it expects a benefit from the health reform law in 2014 of about 1 to 2 percent of its adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.In the fourth quarter, net income was $424 million, or 92 cents a share, compared with $314 million, or 68 cents a share, a year ago. Revenue increased 4.8 percent to $8.84 billion. Analysts on average had expected earnings of 86 cents a share on revenue of $8.83 billion, according to Thomson ReutersI/B/E/S.  HCA said fewer patients were admitted for pulmonary treatments and short stays in the fourth quarter compared with last year, when the flu season was more severe. But revenue per admission increased 4.6 percent. The company forecast 2014 earnings excluding special items in a range of $3.45 to $3.75 a share on revenue of $35.5 billion to $36.5 billion.HCA shares rose about 3 percent to $49.96 in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange.(Reporting by Susan Kelly in Chicago; Editing by Rosalind Russell)",2014-02-04,HCA,"Tue Feb 4, 2014 | 9:42am EST","HCA posts higher profit, sees health reform benefit",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-hca-results-idUSBREA130UQ20140204?type=companyNews

6,"  (Adds company comments on reform from conference call, updates share movement)By Susan KellyApril 29 HCA Holdings Inc on Tuesday reported quarterly earnings just shy of analysts' expectations, and its top executive said the U.S. hospital chain had not yet benefited from President Barack Obama's healthcare reform law.Shares of HCA fell 3.8 percent to $50.61 in midday trading.""As expected, healthcare reform had minimal impact on the company's first-quarter results,"" Chief Executive Officer R. Milton Johnson said. ""However, we remain optimistic regarding the potential long-term benefits.""Hospital stocks, including HCA, got a boost last week after smaller U.S. chain LifePoint Hospitals Inc said participation in private insurance marketplaces and expanded Medicaid services for the poor were exceeding its expectations.HCA, the largest U.S. for-profit hospital operator, said     first-quarter net income rose to $347 million, or 76 cents a share, from $344 million, or 74 cents a share, a year earlier.Excluding one-time costs for legal claims and the early retirement of debt as well as the impact of facilities sales, the company earned 84 cents a share. Analysts on average had expected 85 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue increased 4.6 percent to $8.83 billion.The company affirmed the 2014 outlook it gave in February for earnings of $3.45 to $3.75 a share, excluding special items, on revenue of $35.5 billion to $36.5 billion.HCA continued its track record of generally stronger patient volume trends than its peers, said CRT Capital Research analyst Sheryl Skolnick. The company said it had generated more revenue from patients even as it admitted fewer people to its facilities. Hospitals are expected to gain a clearer picture of health reform's impact on patient volumes in the second half of the year.HCA is not expected to benefit as much as some of its competitors from the expansion of Medicaid because it has fewer hospitals in states that opted to expand their participation in the federal program for the poor.REFORM DETAILS  HCA hospitals during the quarter admitted 1,700 patients who were insured through the exchanges, or less than 1 percent of a base of 440,000 total admissions, company officials said on a conference call.Half of those patients had previously visited HCA hospitals. Of that group, one-third enrolled in an exchange program after being uninsured.Patients insured through the exchanges grew as the quarter progressed, with admissions of those customers doubling in March from February.""We saw encouraging signs from healthcare reform during the quarter and found them to be consistent with our expectations,"" Johnson said on the call.The company said admissions to facilities it had operated for at least one year declined 0.6 percent in the quarter from a year earlier, but revenue per equivalent admission rose 3.7 percent.Admissions fell at U.S. hospitals during the economic downturn as people who lacked health insurance or faced higher out-of-pocket expenses avoided seeking medical care. The health reform law and its exchanges are expected to benefit the industry this year by expanding insurance availability to more patients.

29,"   By Caroline Humer | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Humana Inc, fresh from announcing an agreement to be purchased by larger rival Aetna Inc, prompted new investor concerns about the $33 billion deal on Monday by lowering its 2015 financial forecasts. The transaction announced on Friday is already expected to face a tough review by U.S. antitrust regulators, particularly if another major deal among health insurers emerges. Humana, which has posted disappointing results for several quarters in a row, said on Monday that members of its Medicare Advantage plans for the elderly were using hospital services at a higher rate than the company expected. That increase could cut into already tight profit margins, if Humana ends up paying more for medical claims than they anticipated when setting monthly insurance rates.Humana CEO Bruce Broussard said on a conference call with investors that inpatient hospital admissions have not performed in line with what the company had forecast. That contributed to its decision to slash expected 2015 operating profits by more than 8 percent. The company said it had taken the higher Medicare Advantage hospital use into account when it priced premiums for 2016. ""If you take the 8 percent downgrade of their earnings and roll that through, that makes what Aetna paid pretty expensive,"" said Joel Emery, a portfolio manager at Tareo Capital Management in New York. The degree to which Humana will boost Aetna's earnings in 2017 and 2018 is less than what some investors had hoped for, he said.Aetna's offer of $125 in cash and 0.8375 Aetna shares for each Humana share valued Humana at $230 per share. On Monday, Aetna fell 6 percent to $117, bringing down the offer price to $223 per share.Reflecting growing doubts about the deal, Humana shares traded well below the proposed offer price, closing at $188.96.

30,"   By Caroline Humer | NEW YORK, July 6  NEW YORK, July 6 Humana Inc, fresh from announcing an agreement to be purchased by larger rival Aetna Inc, prompted new investor concerns about the $33 billion deal on Monday by lowering its 2015 financial forecasts.The transaction announced on Friday is already expected to face a tough review by U.S. antitrust regulators, particularly if another major deal among health insurers emerges.Humana, which has posted disappointing results for several quarters in a row, said on Monday that members of its Medicare Advantage plans for the elderly were using hospital services at a higher rate than the company expected.That increase could cut into already tight profit margins, if Humana ends up paying more for medical claims than they anticipated when setting monthly insurance rates. Humana CEO Bruce Broussard said on a conference call with investors that inpatient hospital admissions have not performed in line with what the company had forecast. That contributed to its decision to slash expected 2015 operating profits by more than 8 percent. The company said it had taken the higher Medicare Advantage hospital use into account when it priced premiums for 2016.""If you take the 8 percent downgrade of their earnings and roll that through, that makes what Aetna paid pretty expensive,"" said Joel Emery, a portfolio manager at Tareo Capital Management in New York. The degree to which Humana will boost Aetna's earnings in 2017 and 2018 is less than what some investors had hoped for, he said.Aetna's offer of $125 in cash and 0.8375 Aetna shares for each Humana share valued Humana at $230 per share. On Monday, Aetna fell 6 percent to $117, bringing down the offer price to $223 per share. Reflecting growing doubts about the deal, Humana shares traded well below the proposed offer price, closing at $188.96.""Aetna shareholders have to approve the deal, and with such a large premium, there is some outside chance that shareholders will not approve it,"" said Standard & Poor's equity analyst Jeffrey Loo.

31,"   By Greg Roumeliotis  KKR & Co LP (KKR.N) said on Thursday that its second-quarter earnings rose 67 percent year-on-year, reaching a quarterly record that far exceeded most analysts' expectations, as its private equity funds appreciated far more than the wider market.KKR's strong performance is due to the rise in value of a few large portfolio companies, such as payment processor First Data Corp, which this week filed for an initial public offering, and hospital operator HCA Holdings Inc (HCA.N).The results are in contrast to those of peer Blackstone Group LP (BX.N), which last week reported a 62 percent slumpin second-quarter earnings, as weak global stock markets weighed on the value of its portfolio. KKR said its private equity portfolio appreciated 7.4 percent in the second quarter, compared with a 5 percent appreciation in the second quarter of 2014. Blackstone's private equity funds appreciated 3.5 percent in the second quarter of 2015.KKR said economic net income (ENI) was $839.9 million in the second quarter, up from $501.6 million a year ago. This translated into post-tax ENI per adjusted unit of 88 cents, higher than the 61 cents average forecast by analysts in a Thomson Reuters poll. In the second quarter, the New York-based firm completed a $14 billion deal to sell orthopedic products maker Biomet Inc to Zimmer Holdings Inc (ZBH.N), and sold shares in TV ratings company Nielsen NV (NLSN.N) and retailer Pets at Home Group Plc (PETSP.L).Overall, assets sales generated less cash than they did a year ago and so total distributable earnings, which shows cash available to pay dividends, was $491.4 million in the second quarter, down from $701 million a year ago. As a result, KKR disclosed a second-quarter distribution of 42 cents per common unit. KKR, which was founded in 1976 by Henry Kravis, George Roberts and Jerome Kohlberg, said assets under management totaled $101.6 billion as of the end of June.

40,"   By Susan Kelly  Oct 27 Hospital operator HCA Holdings Inc  on Tuesday said more patients are coming through its doors who have lost their health insurance, most likely because they stopped paying for it.The largest U.S. for-profit hospital chain said it admitted more uninsured patients in the third quarter who had previously registered with health insurance, compared with a year ago. They included people who bought coverage from marketplaces set up under President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act, but then dropped it.""We believe this is likely due to non-payment of premiums,"" HCA Chief Financial Officer Bill Rutherford said on the company's earnings call.Overall, the company admitted 13.6 percent more uninsured patients in the third quarter. It was the second straight quarterly increase in uninsured admissions, reversing a downward trend since the insurance exchanges opened for business in early 2014. Slowing enrollment in the Medicaid program for the elderly also contributed to the third-quarter rise, the company said. Both HCA and No. 2 hospital operator Community Health Systems earlier this month warned of weaker-than-expected third-quarter results, accelerating a rotation out of healthcare stocks. Investors fear diminishing benefits from the healthcare reform law, which expanded insurance coverage to more Americans.Shares of hospital operators as well as health insurers have pulled back sharply, with HCA down nearly 28 percent from a mid-July peak and Community Health shedding more than half of its value since late June. Investors are wary of slowing enrollment on the insurance marketplaces set up under the healthcare law as Americans struggle to afford the cost of purchasing coverage. Coverage is subsidized for patients who meet income requirements, but the subsidies phase out at higher income levels, and co-payments and deductibles can be stiff.""If you find yourself not really using it, it is an awful lot of money to spend. It's not free, and it can be kind of pricey,"" said Mizuho Securities analyst Sheryl Skolnick. On Monday, U.S. health officials projected premiums will increase an average of 7.5 percent next year for the second-lowest-cost silver insurance plans to be offered in the 37 states where the federal government operates the marketplaces.Health officials earlier this month predicted modest growth in enrollment on the insurance exchanges next year, projecting 10 million people would sign up for plans by the end of 2016. The forecast represents an increase of about 900,000 people from projected enrollment at the end of this year.(Reporting by Susan Kelly in Chicago; Editing by Christian Plumb)",2015-10-27,HCA,"Tue Oct 27, 2015 | 5:19pm EDT",HCA says some patients dropping their new insurance coverage,http://www.reuters.com//article/hca-holdings-coverage-idUSL1N12R2BR20151027?type=companyNews

45,"   By Susan Kelly  The chief executive of HCA Holdings Inc on Monday said he expects the Affordable Care Act to drive more growth for the U.S. hospital operator in 2016 as Americans sign up for insurance coverage through exchanges created under the law.""We are very encouraged by the open enrollment results so far,"" R. Milton Johnson, CEO of the largest U.S. for-profit hospital chain, said in remarks at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco.HCA's shares were up about 6 percent at $68.12 in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange. About 11.3 million Americans have signed up so far for individual health insurance in 2016 through HealthCare.gov and the state-based exchanges, the U.S. government said last week. Enrollment for these plans, which were created under the health reform law known as Obamacare, closes on Jan. 31. HCA on Friday raised its outlook for adjusted earnings in 2015, saying it admitted more patients to its hospitals and treated more people in its emergency rooms.In October, HCA had warned of weaker-than-expected third-quarter results and said it was seeing more patients without insurance, including some who had purchased coverage through the exchanges but then dropped it in the second half of the year.     U.S. health insurers have said they are losing money on the exchanges because many of their patients are older or have high medical costs. UnitedHealth Group Inc, the largest U.S. health insurer, in November said it is considering exiting the exchanges in 2017 because weak enrollment and high costs were taking too big a toll on its performance. HCA's Johnson on Monday said some attrition in exchange enrollment was to be expected in the second half of the year, after an initial spike higher due to the sign-up period. But he predicted the number of people dropping coverage would likely be relatively small. ""We are going to see some seasonality in reform,"" he said.

46,"   By Susan Kelly  Jan 11 The chief executive of HCA Holdings Inc  on Monday said he expects the Affordable Care Act to drive more growth for the U.S. hospital operator in 2016 as Americans sign up for insurance coverage through exchanges created under the law.""We are very encouraged by the open enrollment results so far,"" R. Milton Johnson, CEO of the largest U.S. for-profit hospital chain, said in remarks at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco.HCA's shares were up about 6 percent at $68.12 in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange. About 11.3 million Americans have signed up so far for individual health insurance in 2016 through HealthCare.gov and the state-based exchanges, the U.S. government said last week. Enrollment for these plans, which were created under the health reform law known as Obamacare, closes on Jan. 31.HCA on Friday raised its outlook for adjusted earnings in 2015, saying it admitted more patients to its hospitals and treated more people in its emergency rooms. In October, HCA had warned of weaker-than-expected third-quarter results and said it was seeing more patients without insurance, including some who had purchased coverage through the exchanges but then dropped it in the second half of the year.U.S. health insurers have said they are losing money on the exchanges because many of their patients are older or have high medical costs. UnitedHealth Group Inc, the largest U.S. health insurer, in November said it is considering exiting the exchanges in 2017 because weak enrollment and high costs were taking too big a toll on its performance. HCA's Johnson on Monday said some attrition in exchange enrollment was to be expected in the second half of the year, after an initial spike higher due to the sign-up period. But he predicted the number of people dropping coverage would likely be relatively small. ""We are going to see some seasonality in reform,"" he said.Johnson said he expects additional states will opt to expand Medicaid coverage for the poor in future years under health reform, but not in 2016.He also said HCA is interested in growth through acquisitions, but noted a lack of ""willing sellers"" in the market.

54,"   By Ankur Banerjee  HCA Holdings Inc's (HCA.N) efforts to rein in costs has helped the company cement its position as the largest U.S. for-profit hospital operator, far outperforming its highly leveraged rivals amid a slowdown in demand.The company on Thursday posted a higher-than-expected quarterly profit, buoyed by cost controls and a modest growth in patient admissions.HCA's labor costs and expenses on salaries and benefits came in at 42.7 percent of net revenue in the third quarter - 104 basis points below that projected by Barclays analysts.Barclays said the drop in labor costs was in contrast to that reported by rival Community Health Systems Inc (CYH.N) in its preliminary results on Wednesday.Investor sentiment on hospital operators has soured this year as concerns have mounted over slowing patient volumes, rising expenses and high debt.HCA said equivalent admissions, which include both patients who stay in the hospital overnight and those who are treated on an outpatient basis, rose 1.3 percent in the third quarter. Community Health reported a 1.5 percent fall in quarterly adjusted admissions on a same-store basis, while costs related to health insurance and state supplemental programs rose.For Tenet Healthcare Corp (THC.N), which relies heavily on the federal government for most of its revenue, the main concern is likely to be reimbursement pressure, analysts said.The government, through President Barack Obama's healthcare reform law, is exerting greater power over the acute-care industry by making changes to Medicare payments, including payment cuts and treatment quality incentives.
