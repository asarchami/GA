4,"  March 10 (The following statement was released by the rating agency)Fitch Ratings has upgraded the Issuer Default Rating  (IDR) of PulteGroup, Inc. (NYSE: PHM) to 'BB+' from 'BB'.  The Rating Outlook is  Stable. A complete list of rating actions follows this release.KEY RATING DRIVERS The upgrade of the IDR reflects PHM's solid operating performance in 2013 and  current financial ratios which compare well with those of its peers, substantial  liquidity position and favorable prospects for the housing sector in 2014 and  2015.  Fitch believes that the housing recovery is firmly in place (although the  rate of recovery remains well below historical levels and the upturn will likely  continue to occur in fits and starts).The rating for PHM also reflects the company's broad geographic and product  diversity, a long track record of adhering to a disciplined financial strategy  and, somewhat more recently, an at times, aggressive growth strategy.  The  merger with Centex in August 2009 further enhanced the company's broad  geographic and product line diversity.  Centex's significant presence in the  first move-up and especially in the entry-level categories complements PHM's  strength in both the move-up and active adult segment.  PHM's Del Webb (active  adult) segment is perhaps the best recognized brand name in the homebuilding  business. The company also did a good job in reducing its inventory and  generating positive operating cash flow during the severe housing downturn from  2007 through 2011 and since then.  The Stable Outlook takes into account the  solid housing outlook for 2014 and 2015.PHM's future ratings and Outlook will be influenced by broad housing market  trends as well as company-specific activity such as land and development  spending, general inventory levels, speculative inventory activity (including  the impact of high cancellation rates on such activity), gross and net new-order  activity, debt levels and free cash flow trends and uses.DEBT AND LIQUIDITY The ratings upgrade also takes into account the company's successful execution  of its debt repayment strategy following the merger with Centex in August 2009  and more recently.  Subsequent to the merger the company repurchased $1.5  billion of senior notes through a tender offer.  PHM also retired $898.5 million  in debt in 2010, $323.9 million in 2011, $592.4 million in 2012 and $461.4  million in 2013. On Feb. 21, 2014, the company announced the redemption of the  $95.6 million outstanding 5.20% unsecured senior notes due February 2015 and the  redemption of $150 million outstanding 7.375% unsecured senior notes due June  2046.  The redemptions will occur on March 26, 2014.  The company's remaining  debt maturities are well laddered with $238 million scheduled to mature in 2015  and $465.2 million due in 2016.The reduced debt and growing profitability have enabled the company to improve  its debt/EBITDA ratio from 14.3x at the end of 2010 to 2.3x at the conclusion of  2013.  During that same period, interest coverage improved to 5.7x from 0.9x. PHM ended the December 2013 quarter with $1.58 billion of unrestricted cash and  equivalents and $2.06 billion of senior notes.As a cost saving measure and to provide increased operational flexibility, PHM  voluntarily terminated its $250 million unsecured revolving credit facility  effective March 30, 2011.  Fitch anticipates that PHM will re-establish a credit  facility over the next 12-18 months.As is the case with other public homebuilders, PHM is using the liquidity  accumulated over the past few years to expand its land position and trying to  opportunistically acquire land at attractive prices.In late July 2013 the board of directors reinstituted a quarterly dividend  ($0.05 per share).  The board had eliminated the $0.04 per share quarterly  dividend in November 2008 to conserve cash.  During 2013, PHM repurchased  $127.66 million of its common stock; $234.3 million remains under the current  share repurchase authorization. Even with substantial land and development spending in 2014 as well as some  moderate share repurchase activity and about $51 million paid out in dividends,  Fitch expects PHM will end the year with a cash position between $900 million  and $1.4 billion.MARGIN ENHANCEMENT AND COST-REDUCTION EFFORT PHM has realized considerable improvement in gross profit margins, before real  estate charges, from 8.7% in 2009 to 20.4% in 2013 and on-going operational  initiatives which are expected to at least maintain and potentially generate  further margin expansion.  Those initiatives include a rising share of closings  from the implementation of common plans to help drive construction efficiency,  favorable product mix benefiting from move-up and active adult closings, pushing  design, engineering and purchasing activities out to field operations to drive  local costs lower, and working to ensure proper balance of dirt vs. lower margin  speculative sales (currently 76.4% pre-sold, 23.6% spec).REAL ESTATE As of Dec. 31, 2013, PHM controlled 123,478 lots, of which 77.1% are owned and  the remaining 22.9% are controlled through options. Total lots controlled  represent an approximately seven-year supply of total lots based on LTM closings  and the company owns 5.4 years of lots. The company's land position has  historically been longer compared to other public homebuilders due to its Del  Webb operations. PHM's active adult and certain master-planned communities can  extend from five to seven years or longer during their build-out.During the past few years, the company has been relatively subdued in committing  to incremental land purchases because of its already sizeable land position. Of  course, the acquisition of Centex in 2009 allowed the company to sharply  increase its land position. PHM spent $750 million on land and development in 2009, while Centex spent  roughly $200 million.  PHM spent $980 million on land and development in 2010  and $1.04 billion in 2011.  The company paid out $924 million for land and  development in 2012 - roughly 1/3 for land and 2/3 for development activities.   PHM expended approximately $1.3 billion on real estate in 2013 with roughly 40%  for land and 60% for development.  The preliminary management projection for  spending in 2014 is $2 billion with 45% targeted for land and 55% for  development activities. (For perspective, PHM alone spent $4.6 billion on land  and development in 2006.)PHM continues to have meaningful development expenditures, partially due to its  Del Webb active adult (retiree) operations, but largely related to its Pulte  brand. Currently, fewer developed lots are available to buy; thus, more raw  land, which will require development spending, is being acquired for its Pulte  and Centex brands. This is also the case for other homebuilders.Fitch is comfortable with PHM's land strategy given the company's cash position,  debt maturity schedule, proven access to the capital markets, and management's  demonstrated discipline in pulling back on its land and development activities  during periods of distress. Additionally, Fitch expects management to be  disciplined with the uses of its cash, refraining from significant share  repurchases or one-time dividends to its stockholders that would meaningfully  deplete its liquidity position.THE INDUSTRY Housing metrics showed improvement in 2013. Single-family housing starts grew  15.5%, while new-home sales increased 16.3%. Existing home sales advanced 9.2%  in 2013. The most recent Freddie Mac 30-year interest rate was 4.28%, 97 bps  above the all-time low of 3.31% set the week of Nov. 21, 2012. The NAR's latest  monthly existing home affordability index was 168.1, well below the all-time  high of 213.6, but still meaningfully above the 20-year average.  Housing  metrics should increase in 2014 due to faster economic growth (prompted by  improved household net worth, industrial production and consumer spending), and  consequently, some acceleration in job growth (as unemployment rates decrease to  6.9% for 2014 from an average of 7.5% in 2013), despite somewhat higher interest  rates as well as more measured home price inflation. A combination of tax  increases and spending cuts in 2013 shaved about 1.5pp off annual economic  growth, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Many forecasters expect  the fiscal drag in 2014 to be one-third that amount or less.Fitch's housing estimates for 2014 are as follows: Single-family starts are  forecast to grow almost 20% to 741,000, while multifamily starts expand about 9%  to 333,000; single-family new-home sales should grow approximately 20% to  513,000 as existing home sales advance 2.0% to 5.19 million.  Average  single-family new-home prices (as measured by the Census Bureau), which dropped  1.8% in 2011, increased 8.7% in 2012. Median new-home prices expanded 2.4% in  2011 and grew 7.9% in 2012. Average and median new-home prices improved 9.8% and  8.4%, respectively, in 2013.  New-home price inflation should moderate in 2014,  at least partially because of higher interest rates. Average and median new-home  prices should rise about 3.5% this year. RATING SENSITIVITIES Additional positive rating actions leading to a low investment-grade rating,  although unlikely in the near term, may be considered if the recovery in housing  is maintained and is better than Fitch's current outlook; PHM shows continuous  improvement in credit metrics (particularly debt-to-EBITDA of 2x or lower and  interest coverage in excess of 8.5x and then maintains those metrics); and the  company maintains a substantial liquidity position.A negative rating action could be triggered if the industry recovery dissipates;  PHM's 2014 revenues drop sharply while the EBITDA margins decline below 10%; and  PHM's liquidity position falls sharply, perhaps below $500 million.Fitch has upgraded the following ratings for PHM:PulteGroup, Inc.:--Long-term IDR to 'BB+' from 'BB';--Senior unsecured notes to 'BB+' from 'BB'.Centex Corp.:--Long-term IDR to 'BB+' from 'BB';--Senior unsecured debt to 'BB+' from 'BB'.",2014-03-10,PHM,"Mon Mar 10, 2014 | 8:53am EDT",RPT-Fitch upgrades PulteGroup's IDR to 'BB+'; outlook stable,http://www.reuters.com//article/fitch-upgrades-pultegroups-idr-to-bb-out-idUSFit69268220140310?type=companyNews
5,"   By Sagarika Jaisinghani  D.R.

Horton Inc, the No.1 U.S. homebuilder, said it had to offer discounts in the third quarter to boost sales in Chicago, a particularly bleak spot in a weak U.S. housing market.D.R. Horton's shares fell more than 10 percent, their largest intra-day percentage fall since 2009, after the company said an impairment charge on its Chicago properties led to a 23 percent slump in profit. ""We (increased) the level of incentives in many communities throughout the spring in an effort to improve sales and maximize returns and profit,"" Chief Financial Officer Bill Wheat said on a conference call.Higher U.S. home prices along with rising mortgage rates in 2014 have reduced affordability for many, resulting in an underwhelming spring selling season, which is to homebuilders what the holiday season is to retailers.A recovery in the overall U.S. housing market has slowed more than expected this year. New home sales dropped 8.1 percent in June, the largest decline in about a year, according to a report from the Commerce Department on Thursday.D.R. Horton said on Thursday that Chicago in particular was performing below its expectations. The company reported a 15 percent drop in home deliveries in the Midwest, including Chicago, and the Southwest in the quarter. Each region accounted for 8 percent of the company's revenue in 2013.Incentives such as lower selling prices reduced D.R. Horton's gross margins to 20.7 percent in the quarter ended June 30 from 21.4 percent a year earlier.In contrast, smaller peer PulteGroup Inc said on Thursday higher prices helped it post a 15 percent rise in profit for the quarter ended June 30.

37,"   By Laila Kearney | NEW YORK, April 18  NEW YORK, April 18 Investors may be warming to homebuilder PulteGroup, even though the company has been underperforming its Wall Street peers and its namesake founder is locked in battle with the company's chief executive officer and many of its directors.With shares down more than 15 percent over the past year, dwarfing the 1.4 percent decline in the S&P Homebuilders Select Industry Index, PulteGroup founder and biggest shareholder William Pulte is pushing the board to quickly oust CEO Richard Dugas, who recently announced plans to retire in May 2017.Pulte, who owns 8.97 percent of the company's shares, and joined by his grandson Bill Pulte, has faulted Dugas for a leadership style and strategy that he said has led the company's stock to sharply underperform its competitors.But some analysts and investors see opportunity. Short interest in the stock is down, and the company has done slightly better than its peers on Wall Street this year.""We think this reflects investors' excitement at a potential pivot to growth,"" Deutsche Bank said in a research report published Friday that pointed to a recent uptick in orders and construction of new communities.PulteGroup's annual shareholder meeting is scheduled for May 4, but the Pulte family is not expecting a quick resolution to the call for change at the top. The company's board members, most of whom were appointed by Dugas, are expected to be reelected at the meeting and continue to clash with the founder's vision for the company, Bill Pulte said.""This is just the beginning of what unfortunately seems like a long process,"" he said.In the meantime, the decline in the stock has bumped Pulte's dividend up to an attractive 1.93 percent yield and positioned the company, typically premium priced compared to competitors such as Lennar Corporation and D.R. Horton Inc., as a cheap buy. Pulte stock is now selling at roughly 11 times expected earnings for the next 12 months, compared with its typical forward PE of almost 16. ""PHM now trades at a discount to these same large-cap peers, which we believe more than sufficiently discounts any management-related uncertainty,"" Barclays Research said in a note this month. It has upgraded PulteGroup to equal weight from underweight.Short interest in PulteGroup has fallen from a near two-year high of 9.8 percent of outstanding shares at the start of February, to 6.75 percent now, according to Astec Analytics data.On April 4, when Dugas, who was already under pressure from William Pulte, announced his 2017 retirement plans, shares fell as much as 9.8 percent before closing down 6.6 percent. On that day, William Pulte wrote a letter condemning the company's board of directors for failing to immediately push out Dugas.Pulte said Dugas had been overly aggressive with land purchases, lost talented employees who went to work for competitors and spent too much on dividend payouts and share buybacks.PulteGroup has defended Dugas, who has been CEO since 2003, noting that since 2012 he has helped the company boost income, cut debt and - in 2015 - returned $559 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.The public dispute doesn't threaten the company's fundamentals, said Jack Micenko, deputy director of research at Susquehanna Financial Group, who maintains a ""buy"" rating for PulteGroup.""It's a bit of a soap opera,"" he said.

51,"   By Ankit Ajmera and Michael Flaherty  PulteGroup Inc (PHM.N) said on Thursday it has appointed three new directors to its board as part of a settlement deal with Elliott Management Corp, the hedge fund founded by billionaire Paul Singer.Shares of the No. 3 U.S. homebuilder rose as much as 5.3 percent to close at $21.51.The appointment comes as the company searches for a new chief executive after Chairman and CEO Richard Dugas announced his resignation, effective May 2017, bowing to a demand from founder and largest shareholder Bill Pulte.Elliott Management, the activist hedge fund founded by billionaire Paul Singer, took a 4.7 percent stake in PulteGroup in June.""The final candidate selection (for board's independent directors) was the result of a fruitful collaboration and discussion with Elliott,"" Dugas said.PulteGroup appointed John Peshkin, Scott Powers and Joshua Gotbaum as independent directors, expanding the board's size to 13. Peshkin is a managing partner at private real estate investment group Vanguard Land LLC, while Scott Powers most recently was the executive vice-president of State Street Corp (STT.N). Joshua Gotbaum is a guest scholar at the Brookings Institution.Peshkin and Gotbaum will also join PulteGroup's previously established CEO search committee.Dugas said he hoped that the CEO search committee would be able to ""wrap up their work"" over the next couple of months.PulteGroup said the homebuilder and affiliates of Elliott have agreed that Elliott will support PulteGroup's slate of director nominees at its 2017 shareholder meeting. PulteGroup's home sales have underperformed those of D.R. Horton Inc (DHI.N) and Lennar Corp (LEN.N) in 2015, dropping 0.4 percent to 17,127 homes.D.R. Horton's home sales rose 28 percent last year, and Lennar's increased 16 percent.PulteGroup also said it plans to slow land acquisition, and use cash flows from operations to help fund repurchase of $1.5 billion of shares over the next six quarters. Bill Pulte said in a letter addressed to shareholders that he was satisfied with the initial progress made at PulteGroup toward addressing a prolonged underperformance of its shares. He, however, added that the company still had a lot of ground to cover, especially on cost controls and boosting volumes.PulteGroup's share price has risen about 19 percent since April 4, when Pulte expressed his ""extreme disappointment"" in the leadership of Dugas and asked the board to speed up the succession plan.Elliott believes the buyback, board augmentation and PulteGroup's current land and community investments can almost double the stock to $35-40 per share, said a person familiar with the hedge fund's thinking.

57,"   By Arunima Banerjee and Ankit Ajmera  Toll Brothers Inc's (TOL.N) home orders in the third quarter rose the most in two years, and the company joined other large U.S. homebuilders in posting big jumps in quarterly revenue, underscoring steady growth in the U.S. housing market.Shares of Toll, which builds homes that cost upwards of $2 million, rose as much as 6 percent to $31 on Tuesday - their highest in more than seven months.The luxury homebuilder's results and upbeat new home sales data also boosted the PHLX Housing Index .HGX. Shares of D.R. Horton Inc (DHI.N), PulteGroup Inc (PHM.N) and Lennar Corp (LEN.N) rose 2-3 percent.An improving job market as well as mortgage rates that are near historic lows are supporting a bright outlook for the U.S. housing market.New U.S. single-family home sales unexpectedly rose in July, reaching their highest level in nearly nine years as demand increased broadly.Toll on Tuesday reported an 18.2 percent jump in orders - a key metric of future revenue for homebuilders - to 1,748 units for the third quarter, the highest growth in two years.Revenue jumped 23.5 percent to $1.27 billion.""Demand within Toll remains fine, suggesting that the leisure market is holding fine,"" Gabelli & Co analyst Alvaro Lacayo said. D.R. Horton, the largest U.S. homebuilder, reported last month a nearly 10 percent rise in revenue for the April-June quarter, while PulteGroup, the No.3 U.S. homebuilder, reported a 41 percent rise in the same period.Pulte's shares have risen nearly 20 percent since the beginning of the year, while D.R.

The company, which also develops golf courses and country clubs, expects adjusted gross margin for the year to be 25.6-25.8 percent, compared with its previous range of 25.8-26.2 percent.Toll said it was cutting it full-year gross margin forecast as it expected to deliver a ""few high-margin units"" in its City Living business, which builds high-rises, in fiscal year 2017, instead of fiscal year 2016.City Living accounted for about 8 percent of Toll's annual homebuilding revenue in fiscal 2015.The company's net income nearly doubled to $105.5 million, or 61 cents per share, in the quarter ended July 31 from $66.7 million, or 36 cents per share, a year earlier.Analysts on average had expected a profit of 61 cents per share and revenue of $1.25 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Up to Monday's close, shares of Toll had fallen 12 percent this year.
