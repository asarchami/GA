0,"  LONDON, March 25 British pawnbroker Albemarle & Bond said it would appoint administrators on Tuesday after its lenders declined to  support any rescue plans for the loss-making business.The company, which said on Monday its shareholders would see no return on their investment, said that without the support of its banks it would shortly be unable to meets it liabilities.

1,"  LONDON, April 7 Britain's largest pawnbroker H&T  said on Monday it had submitted a proposal to acquire some of Albemarle & Bond's assets, after the smaller rival entered administration.H&T had said earlier this year that it was looking to make some acquisitions in the sector, despite being hit by the fall in price for gold.Albemarle, which has also been hit by the fall of gold after it expanded heavily in 2011, put itself up for sale in December, but was unable to find a buyer. The company provides short-term loans to individuals and small businesses against items such as watches and jewellery and also buys gold. Founded in 1983, Albemarle has more than 230 stores employing 1,000 people in total, according to its website.

2,"  LONDON, April 15 British pawnbroker Albemarle & Bond will be bought out of administration by investment fund Promethean Investments in a deal which will save the majority of its stores and 628 jobs, administrators said on Tuesday.The acquisition comes a day after Britain's biggest pawnbroker H&T said it was ending talks regarding the possible acquisition of some of A&B's assets.Administrator PwC said in a statement that the deal with Promethean involved it taking on 128 A&B stores out of 187, and 628 staff out of a workforce of 809. A&B was in 2011 hit by the fall of gold after it expanded heavily, having reached a market capitalisation of over 220 million pounds during that year. It put itself up for sale in December, but was unable to find a buyer and its shares were suspended in March before administrators were appointed. ""The deal announced today was the best offer received, preserving the most jobs and keeping the most stores open,"" PwC's Mike Jervis said in a statement. A&B specialises in providing short-term loans to individuals and small businesses against items such as watches and jewellery, and it also buys gold.Promethean, leading the investment on behalf of a group of backers, appointed Stephen Plowman as the new chief executive of A&B. He has 30 years experience in banking insurance, consumer finance and restructuring.

3,"   By Swetha Gopinath and Kanika Sikka  Chemicals maker Albemarle Corp (ALB.N) said it would buy rival Rockwood Holdings Inc ROC.N for $6.2 billion to tap fast-growing demand for lithium products used in mobile phone and automobile batteries.Rockwood shares rose nearly 14 percent to $86 at market open on Tuesday in heavy volume, slightly above Albemarle's offer of $85.53 per share. Albemarle shares rose 5 percent to $76.02.      ""Growth prospects for lithium are better than for any of Albermale's existing businesses,"" said Suntrust Robinson Humphrey analyst James Sheehan. ""They want to capture the upside potential from electrification of automobiles that's likely to occur over the next several years.""U.S. sales of electric vehicles soared to 167,617 in 2013 from 345 in 2010, according to a report published in January by the U.S. Department of Transportation-funded Electric Vehicle Transportation Center. (bit.ly/1wpRMi6)  The deal will give Albemarle access to Rockwood's assets in the Atacama Desert, Chile, providing a low-cost base for lithium production. The combined company will also have a strong presence across three other high-margin businesses â€” supplying catalysts to refineries, bromine for use in offshore drilling and emission control, and surface treatment products to the automobile and aeroplane industries. The deal diversifies Albemarle's portfolio away from bromine, which is in transition between growth cycles, and catalysts, which have very lumpy order patterns, Jefferies analyst Laurence Alexander wrote in a note. Rockwood shareholders will get $50.65 in cash and 0.4803 Albemarle shares for each share they own. Albemarle said it had secured financing from BofA Merrill Lynch to fund the cash portion of the deal.Albemarle expects about $100 million in annual savings by 2016 from the deal. Rockwood, under ex-CEO Seifi Ghasemi, hived off its clay-additives and titanium-dioxide businesses to narrow its focus on lithium and metal surface treatments.  EARNINGS CATALYST  Albemarle said it expected the Rockwood deal, which will likely close in the first quarter of 2015, to add to cash earnings per share in the first year and to adjusted earnings per share in the second year.  The company, which is due to report second-quarter results on July 30, estimated adjusted earnings per share of $1.08 to $1.11. Analysts on average were expecting a profit of 99 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.    BofA Merrill Lynch is Albemarle's financial adviser.

13,"  By Sinead Carew and Caroline Valetkevitch     Dec 7 World leaders gathered in Paris for climate talks are pledging billions of dollars to improve the environment, but green-company investors are not impressed by the promises, seeing little immediate benefit to the companies they buy.     As the two-week United Nations summit enters its final phase, clean energy stocks have gained little ground, and several fund managers say they have not been doing any additional buying as a result of the gathering.      Even if the talks see big commitments for alternative energy development, the money will not start flowing for several years and many of the pledges are aimed at early stage projects that are not run by publicly traded companies, they said.      ""I have quite low expectations of anything meaningful coming out of Paris"" for the near term, said Edward Guinness, portfolio manager at the Guinness Atkinson Alternative Energy Fund in London.     Guinness said that if the agreement is stronger than he expects it may still not benefit alternative energy companies for years, potentially until 2021.     The UN summit, which runs through Dec. 11 and has almost 200 countries participating, is aimed at planning actions by rich and poor nations beyond 2020 to curb greenhouse gas emissions blamed for warming the planet.      The United States, France, India and 17 other countries have promised to double the amount they were collectively expected to spend on clean energy research and development to $20 billion in the next five years. In addition to the public pledges, a group of 28 private investors led by Bill Gates said they would pump billions of dollars in seed money into research and development.       Since the summit began last week, the Market Vectors Global Alternative Strategy exchange-trading fund, which includes wind, solar, electric car and water treatment companies, has moved up about 1 percent, but it remains down 1.6 percent so far in 2015. Tesla Motors, an expected beneficiary of international focus on battery-powered transportation, has risen less than 1 percent since the summit started, though it is up about 5 percent so far in 2015.     Other fund managers including Murray Rosenblith, a portfolio manager of the renewable-energy focused New Alternatives Fund;  Kevin Walenta, portfolio manager of the Fidelity Select Environment and Alternative Energy Portfolio; and Robert Lutts, chief investment officer at Cabot Money Management, said the talks so far had not produced any market-moving news. Rosenblith and others said they did not expect the talks to prompt them to make any changes to their portfolios.      Some analysts were more bullish on the talks than investors. In a note circulated at the start of the talks, Goldman Sachs said the growing focus on low emissions would benefit Tesla, lithium supplier Albemarle and solar-panel efficiency specialist SolarEdge Technologies. It also cited lighting stocks like Acuity Brands.      Goldman said any agreement would be seen as a success.     Wall Street's biggest response might come if the talks somehow derailed altogether, said investors, including Ewen Cameron Watt, global chief investment strategist at BlackRock Inc's Investment Institute. The companies they invest in will have to pay higher legal and insurance costs ""if the final treaty is underwhelming,"" he said.

14,"  SANTIAGO Feb 2 U.S. lithium producer Albemarle has signed a deal with Chile to significantly increase its output of lithium at a time when interest in the mineral that powers electric car batteries is heating up.Albemarle Corp unit Rockwood will invest between $400 million and $600 million in the next four years to increase its production of battery-grade lithium carbonate from Chile to 70,000 tonnes from its current 24,000, the economy ministry said in a statement late Monday.The Chilean government wants to ensure the country will benefit from its natural bonanza and said it will earn up to $100 million annually in taxes and royalties as a result of the Albemarle deal. The company also will support the research in Chile of lithium applications and solar energy.Salt flats in the remote north of Chile and neighboring Bolivia hold some of the world's largest reserves of lithium, an important ingredient in rechargeable batteries. Chile currently is the second largest producer globally, after Australia. ""The (planned) increase will enable the company to meet the accelerating demand for lithium,"" Albemarle said in a statement. A scramble to secure lithium resources has been gathering pace as prices for the mineral have steadily risen, bucking the global commodities trend. Annual demand is forecast to more than double by 2020 from 95,000 tonnes now.In recent weeks, state copper firm Codelco has announced tender plans for two reserves and U.S. electric vehicle maker Tesla was rumored to be in Chile meeting with the government. On Monday, Canada's Wealth Minerals said it was in talks to buy Li3, a firm that owns lithium assets in Chile.Chemicals firm Albemarle spent $6.2 billion to buy Rockwood last year.

23,"   By Andy Home | LONDON  LONDON (The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) Lithium is shaping up to be The Next Big Thing.Prices are going stratospheric, junior miners are rushing to stake claims on future supply and investment websites are glowing red hot with speculation about the metal's prospects. The Global X lithium fund, one of the very few ways to get in on the action, has gained 25 percent over the past three months with assets under management leaping from $41 million to $68 million since the start of the year. It's a far cry from the 1990s, when the U.S. Department of Energy was selling surplus stocks and mines were closing as the nuclear arms race wound down, reducing demand for one of the materials used in hydrogen bombs. But the fortunes of this most versatile of metals were transformed in 1991 when Sony commercialized the lithium-ion battery, now an integral part of just about every electronic device. Now, however, it looks set to scale even greater heights as carmakers, led by Tesla, step up efforts to mass produce electric vehicles using an enhanced version of that same technology. Lithium could become the key material in the coming green revolution of storable energy.But the lightest of metals in the periodic table is shrouded in darkness when it comes to its pricing mechanics. If lithium is going to become an integral part of the global energy supply chain, its market opacity is a big problem. WHAT'S THE PRICE?  Start with the most basic of questions. What is the price of lithium? More than $20,000 a ton on the Chinese spot market for battery grade material, according to research house CRU. It's about $7,000 for Chinese imports of carbonate -- the most traded form of the metal -- but only $5,000 for U.S. imports, analysts at Macquarie Bank said. Whichever measure you use, prices are on the up. CRU estimates that the Chinese spot price has almost tripled from $7,000 the middle of last year. Macquarie, meanwhile, notes that Chinese import prices for Chinese carbonate and export prices for hydroxide have hit record highs. It's a bit confusing, isn't it? There are two problems here. The first is the bewildering number of products that can be made from lithium, ranging from lithium stearate (industrial grease) to lithium fluoride (aluminum smelting) to butyllithium (organic compounds).  All are normally converted for pricing into lithium carbonate, largely used for battery manufacture. But even then the picture is complex. There are different types of carbonate, with lower-grade material for the ceramics and glass industries, for instance, while higher-grade material used in batteries. Nor are lithium-ion batteries themselves homogenous. There are five major types, each using a different lithium compound. Things become even murkier because the second problem with lithium pricing is that most trade is conducted between a small number of producers and their customers. There is no exchange trading, no terminal storage market and only an extremely limited spot market. This means that price assessments such as those from CRU and Macquarie rely first and foremost on published trade volumes and trade values, a statistical sleuthing exercise made more difficult by the complexity of the lithium product chain. The (highly variable) bottom line is that lithium pricing is extraordinarily opaque. OLIGOPOLY  That opacity is a direct result of the way the lithium market is structured. Only four producers control about 85 percent of supply, Macquarie says. Chile's SQM and U.S. companies FMC Corp and Albemarle Corp dominate the production landscape, extracting lithium from salt lakes in Chile and Argentina. Albemarle also operates a brine operation in Nevada. The fourth producer is Australia's Talison, which produces lithium at the Greenbushes mine in Western Australia. But it is hardly an independent, being 49 percent-owned by Albemarle and 51 percent by China's Tianqi Lithium, which takes almost all of the mine's output for processing in China. This oligopoly poses a real challenge for Tesla, will need about 27,000 tonnes of lithium carbonate a year to reach its sales target of 500,000 vehicles a year by the end of 2018. That equates to 16 percent of global consumption last year, Macquarie estimates. Tesla seems to be placing its faith in a new generation of producers, signing prospective off-take agreements with Bacanora Minerals, owner of the Sonora project in Mexico, and with Pure Energy Minerals, which is working on the Clayton Valley project in Nevada. Interestingly, in announcing these deals, both miners said that material would be supplied at a predetermined level below current market pricing in alignment with Tesla's goal to reduce the cost of its batteries.FUTURE UNCERTAIN There is no shortage of other companies staking their claims to profit from the expected lithium rush.  But does the world actually need more lithium? It seems obvious that it will, given the limited number of suppliers and the forecast rise of the electric car. That's why prices are so strong, isn't it? Well, not necessarily.Macquarie Bank argues that one of the reasons the price is so strong is because the oligopoly is running well below capacity. Hard production figures are difficult to come by since none of the major operators publishes them. But based on Australian exports of lithium concentrate, Macquarie suggests that Talison was last year operating its Greenbushes mine at only 60 percent of capacity. ""We believe existing producers will be forced to lift volumes to protect market share and keep new entrants out,"" the bank said in a report last week, adding that it expects prices to peak in late-2017 and then start heading lower.It's a sobering assessment for a metal that is creating such a buzz in the blogosphere. There is an obvious analogy with the rare earths mania of a few years ago, when excitement about the demand outlook for esoteric metals such as neodymium boosted prices only for investor exuberance to be dashed by a realization that there was more than ample supply to feed that demand.Might lithium go the same way? Should we be worried by a future supply squeeze or is supply already being squeezed by dominant producers? Lithium's market dynamics are so dark it is almost impossible to say with any degree of uncertainty. That's a problem for investors. It's also a big problem for the likes of Tesla, who will be at the mercy of those market mechanics, at least until some bright spark invents a new type of battery.
