5,"   By Claire Ruckin | LONDON, July 15  LONDON, July 15 US listed underwear maker Hanesbrands' acquisition of French peer DBApparel is being financed with a $500 million leveraged loan, banking sources said on Tuesday.Hanesbrands agreed to buy DBApparel last month for 400 million euros ($545.62 million) from private equity firm Sun Capital Partners, in an acquisition that brings together the Wonderbra and Playtex brands.JP Morgan, Barclays and HSBC are leading the deal, which consists of a $500 million, euro-denominated term loan B paying an interest margin of 275 basis points (bps) over Euribor with a 75bp Euribor floor, which guarantees minimum returns to investors. The loan is expected to be offered with a 99.5 original issue discount, the banking sources said.Lenders have been asked to make commitments to the BBB-/BAA3 rated loan by July 25. Hanesbrands' existing $1.1 billion revolving credit facility will remain in place, the banking source said.The financing is covenant loose with leveraged and interest cover covenants only, as opposed to the four covenants that are typically used on buyout loans which also include fixed charge and free cashflow covenants. Covenant-loose loans, however, offer more protections than covenant-lite loans, which have no maintenance covenants.""The loan is an interesting one for the loan market because pricing is tight but from a rating and credit quality point of view, and the fact it has covenants, the deal is attractive,"" a banker said.Hanesbrands is based in Winston-Salem North Carolina and employs 51,500 people in more than 25 countries, according to the company's website.

6,"   By David Randall | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Nov 18 Hennessy Funds has been buying shares of J.C. Penney Company Inc and JetBlue Airways Corp as part of a bet on middle-income American consumers, portfolio manager Brian Peery said in an interview on Tuesday.Peery, who co-manages the $341 million Hennessy Cornerstone Mid-Cap 30 fund, said that falling gas prices, a stronger dollar and an improving job market should allow middle-class consumers to spend more freely in the coming year.That makes J.C Penney an attractive option, he said, despite its 19 percent drop for the year to date. The company, which ended an 18-month search by naming Marvin Ellison, the former head of Home Depot's U.S. operations, as its chief executive in October, reported flat same-store sales last quarter and cut its revenue forecast Nov. 12. Shares traded at $7.35 in Tuesday afternoon trading after reaching as high as $11.18 in September. ""At $7, I'm happy to be a buyer,"" Peery said. The company ""is really starting to understand who their customers are and what they want. They've got everything in place, now they just have to execute.""Peery's bet on JetBlue is driven by the belief that lower gas prices should help it improve its margins as it expands its premium class Mint service. While shares of the company are up 51 percent for the year to date, its price still looks ""reasonable"" given that travel by mid-tier consumers should increase in the coming year, Perry said. Other consumer bets in his portfolio include apparel company Hanesbrands Inc, the fund's top holding, food company Pilgrims Pride Corp and shoe company Skechers USA Inc . Peery's fund is up 12.2 percent for the year to date, a performance that puts it in the top 4 percent among mid-cap blend funds tracked by Morningstar. Over the last 10 years, the fund has returned an annualized 11.6 percent, a performance that puts it in the top 1 percent of its peers.(Reporting by David Randall; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)",2014-11-18,HBI,"Tue Nov 18, 2014 | 2:56pm EST","Hennessy Funds adds JC Penney, JetBlue as bet on U.S. consumers",http://www.reuters.com//article/hennessycrnst-mdcp-funds-idUSL2N0T824D20141118?type=companyNews

14,"   By Byron Kaye | SYDNEY  SYDNEY A century after an American founded Australia's biggest underwear brand Bonds, the label is set to return to U.S. ownership after its parent company accepted a A$1.1 billion ($836 million) buyout by clothesmaker HanesBrands Inc (HBI.N).Sydney-listed Pacific Brands Ltd PBG.AX said on Thursday it agreed to an all-cash takeover by North Carolina-based HanesBrands.The offer, at a 22 percent premium to Pacific Brands' last closing price, came after the Australian company underwent an overhaul by moving its manufacturing to China and reshuffling its portfolio of products.""After a number of years of very hard work restructuring the business and getting it into good shape... a very high quality company has recognized all that and said 'we'd like to talk to you',"" Pacific Brands' Chairman Peter Bush told Reuters. Following a period of losses and weak profits as well as political pressure over plans to stop manufacturing in Australia, Melbourne-based Pacific Brands posted its highest interim net profit since 2012 in February. Before the HanesBrands announcement, its shares had tripled since mid-2015.On Thursday, the shares rose another 24 percent to A$1.17, their highest intraday level since 2010 and higher than HanesBrands' A$1.15 offer price, a sign investors believe Pacific Brands may receive a counter-offer.In a separate statement, HanesBrands said the buyout, its sixth in three years, would add Australia and New Zealand to the countries where it has the biggest or second-biggest share of the underwear market. Bonds, started in Australia as a women's hosiery importer by U.S. businessman George Allan Bond in 1915, is Australia's biggest selling brand of men's underwear, women's underwear, children's underwear, babywear and socks.Pacific Brands' Bush declined to comment on the new owner's plans but noted that HanesBrands owns manufacturing facilities in China due to which ""there's some very good synergies"". HanesBrands was advised by Goldman Sachs & Co. It was not immediately clear who advised Pacific Brands.
