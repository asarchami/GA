0,"   By Ernest Scheyder  Chevron Corp (CVX.N), the second-largest U.S. oil company, forecast a fourth-quarter profit on Thursday that likely will miss Wall Street's expectations, as production sags around the globe.In its interim update for the fourth quarter, Chevron said it expects profit to be ""comparable"" with third-quarter results, when it posted net income of $4.95 billion.Yet analysts, on average, expect the San Ramon, California-based company to post fourth-quarter net income of $5.69 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.The company, which competes heavily with Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) and other international energy firms, said production fell due to maintenance at facilities in the Gulf of Mexico, Australia and Angola. Average U.S. oil-equivalent production of oil and gas from wells fell to 650,000 barrels per day (bpd) in October and November from an average of 655,000 for the entire second quarter, Chevron said.The company's average realized U.S. price for crude and related products was $90.17 per barrel in the first two months of the fourth quarter, down from $97.18 in the third. Worldwide, the company produced 2.56 million bpd in the first two months of the fourth quarter, down from 2.59 million in the third.Crude-input volumes at its U.S. refineries jumped as the El Segundo, California refinery resumed normal operations after planned maintenance. Fourth-quarter earnings include foreign exchange gains of $200 million to $300 million, in contract with losses of about $300 million in the third quarter, Chevron said.The company's shares fell about 0.5 percent in after-hours trading on Thursday.

3,"  LONDON Jan 13 U.S. oil firm Chevron Corp  will go ahead with the development of the Alder gas field off the coast of Britain, helping to boost investment in the region and adding to its future production outlook.Chevron said on Monday it had reached its final investment decision for the Adler field and received approval from the British government to go ahead with the development in what a spokeswoman said would be a ""sizeable"" investment.Alder, located in the central North Sea, is set to start producing in 2016 with facilities designed to handle 110 million cubic feet of gas and 14,000 barrels of condensate per day.Current high levels of investment in Britain's North Sea are likely to continue to the end of 2015, energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie forecast last week, adding that capital investment in the region last year hit its highest level in real terms since the mid-1970s. Britain's oil and gas output has fallen by about two thirds since 2000, posting particularly steep falls of 14.5 percent in 2012 and 18 percent in 2011, but big new investments have fuelled hopes that some of the declines can be reversed. New technologies made the development of Alder with its high-pressure, high-temperature characteristics possible, said Chevron, which holds a 74 percent stake in the field alongside ConocoPhillips.In November, Chevron threw doubt on another of its projects in the North Sea, Rosebank, a big development thought to cost around $8 billion, saying it was not currently economically attractive. The company said on Monday that no decision had been reached on Rosebank.""The Rosebank joint venture participants continue to work the front-end engineering and design work and are focusing their efforts on developing an optimum development solution for Rosebank,"" Chevron said in an emailed statement.",2014-01-13,CVX,"Mon Jan 13, 2014 | 10:12am EST",Chevron gives green light to Britain's North Sea Alder project,http://www.reuters.com//article/chevron-alder-idUSL3N0KN3H020140113?type=companyNews
4,"  * Delays could limit sale profits, scupper deals* Shell, Total, Eni, ConocoPhillips also divesting* Nigeria firms, partnered with foreign, biddingBy Joe BrockABUJA, Jan 13 Chevron faces delays in closing sales of oil blocks in Nigeria worth up to $1 billion because of legal disputes involving potential buyers, industry sources say, highlighting a risk other oil majors could face.Chevron is joining competitors ConocoPhillips, Royal Dutch Shell, France's Total and Italy's Eni  in disposing of stakes in onshore and shallow water offshore fields in the Niger Delta region.OPEC-member Nigeria has the potential to double its 2 million-2.5 million barrel per day oil output in the next five years but problems with oil theft, pipeline sabotage and regulatory uncertainty are putting off investment.Oil majors want to keep hold of the biggest producing fields, offshore assets and key pipelines and export terminals.  But they are disposing of less profitable onshore blocks and  fields that the government could strip from them if they remain undeveloped for ten years, notably in the restive Niger Delta.Chevron has chosen its preferred bidders for the five blocks it put up for sale in June but the deals have not closed because rival firms have disputed its decision, with one taking the U.S. company to court, sources close to the deals said.A Chevron spokeswoman said the company did not comment on ongoing transactions.Nigerian firm Brittania-U, run by former Chevron executive Catherine Uju Ifejika, was the highest bidder at over $1 billion for the biggest cluster of blocks - OML 52, 53 and 55 - and Chevron began discussions with the company over the sale, two banking sources close to the deal said. Chevron decided to look at alternative bids after Brittania-U did not show sufficient evidence it could muster the amount promptly, banking and oil industry sources said.Brittania-U did not respond to requests for comment.Chevron then agreed to sell the biggest block, OML 53, to Seplat, which is partly owned by French oil explorer Maurel & Prom and Swiss-based commodity trader Mercuria, while OML 52 would go to local firm Amni Petroleum and the smallest, OML 55, to Belema Oil, run by a local Delta community.$1 BILLION  None of the companies responded to request for comment.A Nigerian federal high court issued an interim injunction in December stopping Chevron from selling the blocks to Seplat and others after Brittania-U brought action against the U.S. major saying it had already agreed a deal to buy the assets, court documents showed.Chevron could earn between $700 million and $900 million for the three blocks, two sources involved in bids said.The three blocks had proven reserves of 555 million barrels of oil equivalent, with the biggest block OML 53 holding 310 million of those reserves, two oil industry sources said, citing a Chevron memorandum given to bidders.Court cases can drag on for years in Nigeria and the longer the delay the less profit oil majors are likely to make from the deals and the greater the chances the sales could fall through altogether. Such litigation also slows down the potential oil and gas production increases that could be felt from new buyers exploiting assets left undeveloped by oil majors.ConocoPhillips has waited for more than a year to close a $1.6 billion deal with Nigeria's biggest energy company, Oando  , for its business in Africa's biggest oil producer because the local firm has taken more than a year to raise finance.Oando plans to raise $193 million in a share issue to help finance the deal, banking sources said in December, and the company has said the acquisition will be completed early this year.Chevron has also agreed to sell two smaller blocks - OML 83 and 85 - to Nigerian firm First Exploration and Production with a bid of around $100 million but the deal has not been completed and rival bidders are also considering disputing this deal, the two banking sources said. They did not give details of which companies might challenge the sale.First E&P's Chairman Henry Odein Ajumogobia is a former foreign affairs minister and its Managing Director Ademola Adeyemi-Bero spent five year working at BG Group.Chevron and First E&P declined to comment.Shell, Total and Eni are selling a combined 45 percent stake in at least four more oil blocks with combined production of around 70,000 barrels per day. Bids on these blocks are due next month, sources said.Shell, the biggest producer in Nigeria, has sold eight oil blocks in the Niger Delta for a total $1.8 billion since 2010 and some industry sources believe the Anglo-Dutch major may have the experience needed to get deals agreed.""It's not about the highest bid, it's about which buyer has the know-how and the connections to get the deals done,"" one executive at a Nigerian company said.",2014-01-13,CVX,"Mon Jan 13, 2014 | 9:07am EST",Legal challenges delay Chevron's $1 bln Nigeria oil block sales,http://www.reuters.com//article/chevron-nigeria-idUSL5N0ID3A220140113?type=companyNews

""The judge said that the order needs to be in place until the case is decided. The order restrains Chevron from transferring the asset or doing anything with the assets.""

6,"  ASTANA Jan 27 Output from Chevron-led  Tengizchevroil (TCO), Kazakhstan's largest oil producer, rose to a record 27.1 million tonnes last year from 24.2 million in 2012, TCO General Director Tim Miller said on Monday.The huge Tengiz onshore field in western Kazakhstan is one of the three main drivers of Kazakhstan's conservative plan to raise oil output to at least 100 million tonnes by 2020.Output this year from the Central Asian nation, the second-largest post-Soviet oil producer after Russia, is forecast to rise to 83 million tonnes from 81.7 million in 2013.""In 2013, TCO achieved record production of 27.1 million tonnes,"" Miller told a meeting of Kazakhstan's Oil & Gas Ministry. ""Last year's TCO payments to Kazakhstan totalled just under $15 billion. This, too, is a new record for TCO."" TCO makes payments to the government budget and to the National Fund, which collects revenue from windfall oil exports.TCO's future growth project for Tengiz, being implemented now, will increase oil production at the field by about 12 million tonnes per year, Miller said, reiterating an earlier estimate. He earlier had said the project would aim to start producing more oil in 2018 to 2019.Chevron holds 50 percent of TCO, while Exxon Mobil  owns 25 percent, Kazakh state oil company KazMunaiGas  20 percent and Lukarco, controlled by Lukoil, the remaining 5 percent. Besides Tengiz, Kazakhstan plans to boost crude output by developing the Kashagan offshore field in the Caspian and by an expansion of the Karachaganak oil and gas condensate field.Output at Kashagan, the world's biggest oil find in decades, was launched in September but halted in early October after leaks were detected in a gas pipeline running from the deposit.A consortium developing Kashagan expects to get the results of pipeline tests next month and determine when output can be resumed safely.",2014-01-27,CVX,"Mon Jan 27, 2014 | 7:00am EST",UPDATE 1-Chevron-led Kazakh oil firm hits record output in 2013,http://www.reuters.com//article/oil-kazakhstan-tengizchevroil-idUSL5N0L11CD20140127?type=companyNews

9,"   By Ernest Scheyder  Chevron Corp (CVX.N) plans to keep spending roughly $40 billion per year for the next several years on new oil and natural gas projects in a bid to lift production that is on track to be flat for the third straight year.That stay-the-course approach, announced on Friday after the second-largest U.S. oil company said its quarterly profit dropped 32 percent, spooked investors and prompted the stock to fall 3.5 percent, the most of any large energy producer this quarter.Like Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N), Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) and other international energy companies, Chevron has tried to offset declining production at its existing oil and natural gas wells by spending massively on new exploration projects.But Shell announced earlier this week that it would focus more on energy projects that have the best chance of success, cutting spending and also selling underperforming assets. The news boosted Shell's stock.Chevron has taken the opposite approach and plans to keep the cash flowing. It spent $41.9 billion last year on energy projects, a 23 percent increase from 2012. Chevron Chief Executive John Watson said he expects capital spending to be in the $40 billion range for the next few years.Chevron is betting that its relatively high dividend yield for the energy industry and its large stock buyback program will appease investors until five of its major projects, including two massive liquefied natural gas projects in Australia and deepwater wells in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, are online.""Basically it's a treadmill,"" said Oppenheimer & Co analyst Fadel Gheit. ""Yes, all these new projects will add oil. But guess what, until they hit that goal, their base line production is declining."" Chevron's oil and natural gas production fell 3.4 percent in the fourth quarter to 2.6 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boed).Rising production in the United States and Nigeria wasn't enough to offset declining production at legacy fields around the world, which typically see production slip 4 percent annually, Chevron said.For 2014, Chevron expects total production of 2.6 million boed, up only 0.5 percent from 2013 levels. The estimate missed Wall Street's expectations and disappointed investors, who had hoped 2014 would be a ""positive transition year"" toward 2017 when new projects come online, Credit Suisse analyst Edward Westlake said in a note.Even if Chevron hits its 2014 production goal, it would only be on par with 2012 levels. Looking forward, Chevron said it has made significant progress on its five main growth projects. In total, the five new protects will add 500,000 boed in production, the company estimates, once fully online.""We are in a depleting resource business, and you do need to add to the portfolio,"" Watson said on a conference call with investors.Last year the company said by 2017 it expects daily production to be 3.3 million boed.The company reported net income of $4.93 billion, or $2.57 per share, compared with $7.25 billion, or $3.70 per share, in the year-ago period. The quarterly profit met expectations of Wall Street analysts, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.The results were not a total surprise to Wall Street, as Chevron hinted earlier this month that its fourth-quarter profit would be ""comparable"" with third-quarter results, when it posted net income of $4.95 billion.In refining, profit plunged 58 percent due to shrinking margins, largely due to price differentials between different types of crude oil.Refiners make more money when the price difference between various types of crude oil is wide. When the gap narrows in the price differences, costs tend to rise. Exxon on Thursday posted weakness in its own refining unit.Profit also fell in Chevron's smallest unit, the power generation and mining unit.Chevron shares fell $4.02, or 3.5 percent, to $112.40 in afternoon trading.

17,"  VIENNA Feb 19 Austria's OMV said it was working with partner Chevron to reduce the costs of their North Sea Rosebank oil and gas project and hoped to reach a final investment decision in 2015.The two had planned to decide this year, but U.S. oil company Chevron said in November the development of the project was not economically attractive. OMV last year estimated the cost at $10 billion.""We now estimate that a final decision will come in 2015,"" OMV's head of exploration and production, Jaap Huijskes, told reporters on Wednesday after the Austrian company presented its 2013 results.""Both Chevron and we are now doing a load of work to ensure that in 2015 there will be an economic value,"" Huijskes said. ""We are working on getting the number below what we mentioned last year."" Chevron's concerns last year raised doubts about a resurgence of the North Sea oil industry as fears grow over costs. OMV bought its 50 percent stake in the project from Norway's Statoil last year, and Huijskes said OMV still intended to sell a 10 to 20 percent stake, although he gave no details of how close it might be to any deal.""There's a lot of work ongoing, both to reduce the cost but also to rephase the cost to make sure that some of the drilling gets delayed to later on in the field life, which will have quite a big impact on the economics of the field,"" he said. OMV plans to invest around 3 billion euros ($4 billion) in exploration and production this year, of a total capital expenditure budget of 3.9 billion euros.Chevron said last month it planned to keep spending roughly $40 billion per year for the next few years on new oil and natural gas projects in a bid to lift production that is on track to be flat for the third straight year.",2014-02-19,CVX,"Wed Feb 19, 2014 | 7:40am EST",UPDATE 1-OMV sees Rosebank decision with Chevron in 2015,http://www.reuters.com//article/omv-rosebank-idUSL6N0LO2EJ20140219?type=companyNews
18,"  Feb 21 Chevron Corp, the second-largest U.S. oil company, said on Friday its oil and natural gas reserves fell slightly last year, largely due to drops in the United States and Africa.The company had proved reserves of 11.2 billion barrels of oil equivalent on Dec. 31, roughly 1.3 percent less than the end of 2012. Declining reserves has become a widespread concern for international oil companies, many of which have massive capital budgets to find and extract oil and natural gas. Proved, developed reserves, a measurement of reserves that can be recovered with existing wells, fell in the U.S., Africa, Asia and Europe, and rose in Australia and in the western hemisphere outside the U.S., the company said in a regulatory filing. Chevron said last month it would keep its massive capital budget, worth about $40 billion, on track for the next few years, a contrast to peers who are cutting spending.",2014-02-21,CVX,"Fri Feb 21, 2014 | 1:09pm EST",Chevron's oil and natural gas reserves fell slightly in 2013,http://www.reuters.com//article/chevron-reserves-idUSL2N0LQ1R320140221?type=companyNews
19,"   By Joseph Ax | NEW YORK  NEW YORK An American lawyer used ""corrupt means"" to secure a multi-billion-dollar pollution judgment against Chevron Corp in Ecuador, a U.S. judge ruled on Tuesday, a major setback for Ecuadorean villagers hoping to collect on the award.U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan in New York said he found ""clear and convincing evidence"" that attorney Steven Donziger's legal team used bribery, fraud and extortion in pursuit of an $18 billion judgment against the oil company issued in 2011.The villagers had said Texaco, later acquired by Chevron, contaminated an oil field in northeastern Ecuador between 1964 and 1992. Ecuador's high court cut the judgment to $9.5 billion last year.But regardless of whether there is pollution at the site, Kaplan said, Donziger cannot use a ""Robin Hood"" defense to justify illegal behavior.Kaplan's decision bars Donziger and the villagers from enforcing the Ecuadorean ruling in the United States. It may also give Chevron legal ammunition in other countries where the plaintiffs could try to go after Chevron's assets.At a six-week trial last year, Chevron accused Donziger of fraud and racketeering and said Texaco cleaned up the site, known as Lago Agrio, before handing it over to a state-controlled entity.Donziger, who has repeatedly leveled accusations of bias against Kaplan and who predicted he would lose the case, called Tuesday's decision ""appalling"" and blamed Kaplan's ""implacable hostility"" toward him and his Ecuadorean clients.""Through this decision, we now have the spectacle of a Manhattan trial judge purporting to overrule Ecuador's Supreme Court on questions of Ecuadorean law,"" he said in a written statement. He vowed to appeal and said the ruling would not stop his clients from seeking to enforce the judgment in other countries.Chevron no longer has significant assets in Ecuador, and the villagers have tried to enforce the ruling in Canada, Argentina and Brazil. Chevron Chief Executive John Watson said the ruling was ""a resounding victory.""The company is expected to use Kaplan's decision to defend itself against claims abroad. In a statement, the company said, ""Any court that respects the rule of law will find the Lago Agrio judgment to be illegitimate and unenforceable.""Chevron and Ecuador also remain locked in an arbitration dispute in international court over cleanup costs at the site.In Washington, the Ecuadorean embassy said in a statement that the decision ""does not exonerate Chevron from its own legal and moral responsibilities resulting from its decades of contamination.""'VOLUMINOUS' EVIDENCE  The decision caps a years-long battle in U.S. courts between Chevron and Donziger, pitting the company's vast resources against a lawyer who argued he was the victim of an unscrupulous corporation.But Kaplan found that the evidence against Donziger was ""voluminous,"" including things like coded emails, secret payments and clandestine meetings with judges that ""normally come only out of Hollywood.""Kaplan said Donziger began pursuing the case with intentions to improve environmental conditions in Ecuador and make a living for himself, but ultimately corrupted the case by submitting fraudulent evidence, bribing a judge, ghost-writing the judgment and covering up his wrongdoing.""The saga of the Lago Agrio case is sad,"" Kaplan wrote. The judge said Texaco, and by extension Chevron, ""might bear some responsibility"" for pollution at the site but that it was irrelevant to the question of whether fraud had occurred.""Justice is not served by inflicting injustice,"" Kaplan wrote. ""The ends do not justify the means. There is no 'Robin Hood' defense to illegal and wrongful conduct.""During the non-jury trial, which ended in November, Kaplan heard from 31 witnesses and considered written testimony from 37 others. Chevron also introduced reams of documents, including Donziger's personal notebook, purporting to show that he was involved in a wide-ranging fraud.Among the witnesses was the former Ecuadorean judge who issued the 2011 judgment, Nicolas Zambrano, who testified that he had received no money and had written the opinion without outside assistance.But Kaplan agreed with Chevron that the evidence showed Zambrano did not write the ruling himself. Instead, Kaplan, said, the plaintiffs' team wrote the judgment, and Zambrano simply signed his name to it.Another former Ecuadorean judge, Alberto Guerra, testified that Donziger's team paid him to ghost-write Zambrano's opinion. Donziger's lawyers pointed out that Chevron had compensated him for testifying and paid for his family's living expenses.Chevron's lawyer, Randy Mastro of Gibson Dunn, pointed to sections of the ruling that appeared to be copied word-for-word from internal documents held by Donziger's team in Ecuador as proof, saying they were ""like fingerprints.""The case is Chevron Corp v.

At one point in his 497-page decision, Kaplan wrote that the ""professional consequences of Donziger's behavior"" may be addressed by other bodies. During a call with reporters on Tuesday, Randy Mastro, an attorney for Chevron, declined to comment on whether the company would refer Donziger to the state's attorney disciplinary committee.A foreign correspondent before attending Harvard Law School, Donziger has a talent for self-promotion, meeting midtrial with journalists in November in a crowded loft apartment in Manhattan where 14 members of his team had been living and working.When he testified, he had sympathizers among the audience, including the singer Sting, who with his wife, Trudie Styler, has offered the villagers support.Standing well over 6 feet tall, with graying temples, Donziger admitted he had made some mistakes but adamantly denied using fraud to win the Ecuadorean judgment.However, he faced difficult questions from Chevron's Mastro, who pointed to emails from a colleague that referred to two judges as the ""puppet"" and the ""puppeteer"" as evidence of a bribery scheme.

They had claimed Texaco, later acquired by Chevron, contaminated an oil field in northeastern Ecuador between 1964 and 1992. The decision bars Donziger and the villagers from enforcing the Ecuadorean ruling in the United States and freezes all proceeds from the judgment.

29,"   By Mica Rosenberg | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Ecuadorean villagers who are trying to get billions of dollars from Chevron Corp for pollution in the Amazon jungle are ready to refocus their fight on pending suits in other countries after a setback in the United States.A scathing judgment issued by a U.S. judge this week against their lawyer will cast a long shadow over cases filed in Canada, Brazil and Argentina, where the plaintiffs are seeking Chevron assets as payment because the oil giant no longer has a presence in Ecuador.U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan handed down a 500-page decision that found American lawyer Stephen Donziger used ""corrupt means"" to help villagers from the Lago Agrio region win the historic $18 billion judgment against Chevron in Ecuador in 2011. The damage award was later revised down to $9.5 billion. While Kaplan's decision bars Donziger and the villagers from enforcing the Ecuadorean ruling in the United States, it is not binding in pending cases elsewhere.Of the three cases, the Canadian one seems to have progressed the farthest, with an appeals court there ruling in December that the province of Ontario was a proper jurisdiction for the plaintiffs to press the company to pay up. Chevron has asked for an appeal of that ruling to be heard by Canada's Supreme Court.Vaughan Black, a professor at the Schulich School of Law in Halifax, Nova Scotia, thinks Kaplan's ruling will resonate if the Canadian case ends up being considered on its merits.""Basically an Ontario court would have to look at all the evidence again and start at the beginning,"" Black said. ""I suppose there is always the possibility that they could take a different view of which witnesses were credible, but the New York court didn't even think it was a close call. So it doesn't look very promising for the Ecuadorean plaintiffs.""The sprawling environmental case stretches back to the 1990s, when the villagers first tried to seek compensation for contamination in northeastern Ecuador by Texaco starting in 1964. Chevron acquired Texaco and for 20 years has been fighting the case as well as Donziger, who has spent most of his career representing the Ecuadorean plaintiffs.The foreign courts will ultimately have to decide how to weigh the evidence presented against Donziger, which Kaplan said proved the judgment in Ecuador was tainted by fraud, against the underlying claims of the villagers who say they were sickened by decades of pollution.The cases in Argentina and Brazil are moving slowly. But the Ontario appeals court in December reversed a lower court decision and found Canada should be a forum to hear Ecuadoreans' claims.Chevron has resisted the Ecuador plaintiffs at every turn. ""We're going to fight this until hell freezes over. And then we'll fight it out in the ice,"" a company spokesman once said.""Chevron's wish is granted,"" the December 17 Ontario Court of Appeal decision said, referring to the spokesman's quote. ""After all these years, the Ecuadorean plaintiffs deserve to have the recognition and enforcement of the Ecuadorean judgment heard on the merits in an appropriate jurisdiction. At this juncture, Ontario is that jurisdiction."" CAST A SHADOW Canada's Supreme Court could decide whether to grant a hearing of the appellate decision in May, according to Canadian legal experts.

""It casts a shadow on it, but it's going to be up to Canadian courts to decide what to do."" Chevron believes Judge Kaplan's ruling in the Southern District of New York will be a game changer for the cases being fought in foreign courts.""No judge in any country that respects the rule of law will entertain the enforcement of the corruption judgment,"" Chevron's General Counsel R. Hewitt Pate said on a call with reporters. ""I think the opinion will carry great weight. ...

Donziger's lawyer Deepak Gupta said he would appeal Kaplan's decision and the villagers would continue to battle it out abroad.In Brazil, the villagers' case is waiting to be heard by a court, said Chevron spokesman Morgan Crinklaw.In Argentina, the Supreme Court reversed a freezing of Chevron's Argentine assets last year, but the enforcement case is still pending, he said. Chevron brought the case to the International Court in the Hague in 2009, claiming it was denied justice in Ecuador. That arbitration is ongoing.In a confidential memo produced as part of the New York trial, Patton Boggs - the law firm that became involved in 2010 to help Donziger enforce the Ecuador judgment - suggests 24 countries where the plaintiffs could potentially study options to enforce the Ecuador judgment.""We don't have a system where one single trial judge, whether they are in New York or anywhere else can appoint themselves a worldwide fact-finding commission and essentially preclude or persuade other courts not to enforce a judgment,"" Gupta said. He said he could not comment on the memo or on what future efforts there might be to try to enforce the judgment in other countries.Alan Lenczner, the lawyer representing the Ecuadorean plaintiffs in Canada, said Kaplan's ruling has ""zero"" impact on the ongoing proceedings in Canada.The case still faces two jurisdictional questions before it is even heard on the merits. One is whether Canada can enforce a foreign judgment, and the other is whether a Chevron subsidiary in the country can be held responsible for the parent's action.If the plaintiffs can win the court battle, they hope to recover in Canada as much of the Ecuadorean judgment as possible.Ultimately, all the international legal wrangling has left the real victims of the legacy of environmental damage out in the cold, said Judith Kimerling, an environmental law professor at The City University of New York, Queens College. Kimerling represents a group of indigenous Ecuadoreans suing Donziger in New York state court for unjust enrichment and seeking to recover resources to clean up the polluted area.""There are real people with real injuries and legitimate claims behind all this,"" Kimerling said.

31,"  By Marianna ParragaHOUSTON, March 7 Nationalizations, currency controls, contract changes, subsidies and political instability over the last 15 years have not prevented energy investors from showing renewed interest in Latin America.With proven oil reserves of 340 billion barrels, the world's second-largest behind the Middle East, Latin America is trying to attract foreign capital for Colombia's onshore and offshore blocks as well as Argentina's large unconventional resources and Mexico's fast-track energy reforms.""The appetite for Latin America is big,"" said Carlos Pau, chairman of the private Argentina-based firm Americas Petrogas, at the IHS CERAWeek energy conference.Low geological risk, increasing regional demand for fuels and proximity to the Atlantic Basin, another consuming market, are among the arguments that companies make for investing.Bigger international players, including Chevron Corp , Spain's Repsol SA, Italy's Eni SpA  and Royal Dutch Shell PLC, have stayed in Latin America despite contractual risks, such as in Venezuela and Argentina.But the companies showing the fastest growth in the region are mid-sized ones that reinvest profits locally instead of repatriating dividends, thereby avoiding limits on currency exchange in some countries.""We take risks. We are working on the second phase of an agreement to buy Harvest (Harvest Natural Resources Inc ) assets in Venezuela. Why there? Because reserves are there,"" Steven Crowell, chief executive officer of Pluspetrol  said at the conference.The company has expanded within the region with exploration and production blocks in Peru, Colombia and Argentina. It is now actively tendering crudes and products on the open market.Paolo Scaroni, the CEO of Eni, said on Wednesday that a crucial offshore gas project in Venezuela with Repsol and state-run PDVSA will start early production at the end of this year, while the company increases crude output at another billion-dollar development in the Orinoco belt, the country's largest reservoir. But companies venturing into the region are now looking at Mexico, where the market is set to open 75 years after a nationalization. That could provide experienced firms and mid-sized ones a chance to build on their success in U.S. shale and offshore plays.MONEY LOCKER ""Can I have my money back?"" That is a frequent question among companies based outside Latin America after price and currency controls surged in recent years, and there is no easy answer.Argentina and Venezuela have imposed long-term restrictions to deal with hard currency shortages, but both are also trying to relax them in a period of economic weakness. Frequent legal changes and the imposition of windfall profit taxes in Venezuela, Colombia and Ecuador since crude prices climbed in 2008 have also contributed to investors' wariness.With a lone bid at the minimum price, a consortium of Brazil's state-run Petrobras, Shell, France's Total , CNOOC and China National Petroleum Corporation in October won the rights to develop the offshore Libra field. The weak result was blamed on onerous local content requirements in a country with high taxes.Low domestic prices also discourage foreign investment. Fuel subsidies account for 2.25 percent of the region's gross domestic product, according to the Latin American Energy Organization, or Olade.At just pennies a gallon, Venezuela has the world's cheapest gasoline after 15 years of frozen prices. It also subsidizes imported gas from Colombia. Argentina is dealing with big gas and diesel subsidies while paying high prices for imports of liquefied natural gas.""At this point, Venezuela would have to multiply the gasoline retail price by 25 to cover production costs,"" said Ramon Espinasa, lead Oil and Gas specialist of the Inter-American Development Bank. Bolivia also has subsidies for the gas sold in its domestic market; Ecuador does the same for its fuels and almost the entire region subsidizes liquefied petroleum gas used for cooking fuel.For their part, Mexico, Chile, Peru and Colombia are working to progressively remove subsidies, which would allow oil operators to recover investments faster and satisfy an incremental demand for all types of fuels.To meet demand, the region quadrupled fuel imports from the United States in the last decade to 1.3 million barrels per day in 2013, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.WHERE TO GO? Clear rules in Peru, Colombia and Uruguay could attract energy investors with a low tolerance for risk, but to get their hands on big deposits companies must be willing to tolerate less favorable terms in Venezuela, Argentina, Brazil and Ecuador.BP, Total and BG won blocks in 2012 to explore offshore Uruguay, while Chevron is expected to be the largest private investor in Argentina's biggest unconventional reservoir, Vaca Muerta, working along with state-run YPF .Mexico, which has under-invested in exploration for years, is widely expected to become a key destination for foreign firms once its government implements an extensive energy reform package.Emilio Lozoya, the CEO of Mexico's state-owned oil company Pemex, said at CERAWeek that Mexico will need $1 trillion to boost oil output to 3 million barrels per day by 2018, increase production of gas and petrochemicals and build new energy infrastructure.""Pemex will be working hard to find the right partners. Conservatively, we can see results (of the reform) in a couple of years,"" he said.",2014-03-07,CVX,"Fri Mar 7, 2014 | 3:20pm EST",CERAWEEK-UPDATE 1-Latin America takes oil spotlight despite troubles,http://www.reuters.com//article/ceraweek-oil-latam-idUSL1N0M22F420140307?type=companyNews

33,"  By Ernest ScheyderNEW YORK, March 11 Chevron Corp, the second-largest U.S. oil company, cut its 2017 production forecast on Tuesday by 6 percent, citing project delays and asset sales, while saying high prices have pushed its new baseline for oil to north of $100 a barrel.The company, like many of its peers, has seen mixed results from heavy spending to lift oil and natural gas production, and shareholders in the sector are pushing for more cost discipline.Chevron trimmed its 2017 production outlook to 3.1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) from a previous forecast of 3.3 million boepd, but stuck to plans to spend $40 billion this year on capital projects, about as much as last year.""Our growth strategy remains intact, though some things have changed,"" Chief Executive John Watson said at the company's analyst day in New York.Despite the more cautious production forecast, Chevron raised the oil price used in its planning models to $110 a barrel from $79. Exxon Mobil, the largest U.S. oil company, is using a similar level of $109 a barrel in its budgets, based on 2013 average prices.""There comes a point when some projects just won't be able to compete for capital"" below $110 per barrel, Watson told reporters after the analyst meeting. Watson cautioned that not all price rises go to Chevron. High crude oil prices have, paradoxically, cut Chevron's cost reimbursement in some contracts and increased costs, Watson said. An increase in the price of oil can entitle Chevron's partners to a higher share of production.""When prices increase, it's just arithmetic at that point,"" he said.In January, Chevron said it expected production of 2.6 million boepd this year, up 0.5 percent from last year. LOW NATURAL GAS PRICES Chevron has slowed development of its holdings in the Marcellus shale formation in the eastern United States due in part to low natural gas prices , which are making it less economical to extract the fuel.Exxon lowered its production outlook for 2017 by 500,000 boepd last week, partly due to lower spending on North American natural gas. Chevron plans to sell about $10 billion of assets in the next three years, an increase from the $7 billion in asset sales in the previous three years, which will also cut production.Most of the new asset sales will be uncompetitive assets in the company's oil and natural gas exploration and production business, Watson and other executives said.While Chevron has insisted on keeping capital expenditures high, many of its peers have cut spending, bowing to investor demand for reduced spending on exploration projects and boosts to dividends and share repurchases.Royal Dutch Shell took the most drastic step earlier this year, vowing to cut $9 billion from its capital spending this year and increase the money it sends shareholders.Watson defended Chevron's capital budget, saying targeted spending is in shareholders' best interest.""What underpinned the original growth estimate we talked about is still there,"" Watson said. ""The best investments produce strong earnings and cash margins, which in turn sustain a strong balance sheet.""Chevron's stock fell $1.33, or 1.1 percent, to close Tuesday trading at $114.51.",2014-03-11,CVX,"Tue Mar 11, 2014 | 5:09pm EDT","UPDATE 5-Chevron cuts production outlook, raises oil price view",http://www.reuters.com//article/chevron-investor-idUSL2N0M80SU20140311?type=companyNews

35,"   By Ernest Scheyder | NEW YORK, March 12  NEW YORK, March 12 Pending California carbon regulations could make it too expensive to operate refineries in the most populous U.S. state, drastically increasing gasoline prices and costing thousands of jobs, a senior Chevron Corp  executive said.The No. 2 U.S. oil company, which runs California's two largest refineries, believes a bill first passed in 2006 and being introduced in phases, would hurt the state's economy and have little impact on climate change, Michael Wirth, who oversees Chevron's refining and chemical businesses, said in an interview on Tuesday.Chevron is especially opposed to a part of the bill, known as AB 32, that starting next year would require all California distributors of transportation fuels to purchase carbon permits to cover emissions from automobiles, a cost the Boston Consulting Group, in a study on behalf of the oil industry, estimates could exceed $3.7 billion.""It's a cost, frankly, that Chevron can't absorb,"" Wirth said at the company's annual investor day. ""No matter how big and successful we are, we can't absorb that cost. We'd have to pass that onto consumers.""Wirth said the rules could sharply push up gasoline price in California, which already has the most expensive gasoline in the United States. Some environmentalists say higher prices would force people to use alternative fuels.California has at times introduced rules tougher than those of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, while the Sierra Club and other environmental groups have publicly stated a goal to eliminate all refineries in the San Francisco area.State legislators approved AB 32 with the goal of reducing California's greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020. The bill gave the California Air Resources Board (CARB) authority to craft regulations that would help meet that goal. CARB decided a cap-and-trade system would best accomplish the greenhouse gas reduction goal. The first phase, for power plants and refineries, was put into place last year. The vast majority of carbon permits thus far have been given out freely.Next year, the second phase will target transportation fuels, which worries Chevron. Under current plans, there will be no free carbon permits for transportation fuels.Carbon permits cost about $12 per tonne today in California, which if the regulation was in effect on transportation fuels today would translate to a roughly 12 cents per gallon increase.Boston Consulting Group estimated the price of California gasoline could jump 49 cents to $1.83 per gallon by 2020 under the new regulations. Other estimates show a lower impact. Global demand for oil is far more likely to cause a sudden rise in California gasoline prices in the coming years than an unlikely run up in carbon prices, according to analysts. But unlike world markets, carbon is a cost that California voters could take steps to ease or remove.It is far from probable, however, that Chevron could pull out of the California refining market entirely, said Wayne Miller, associate director of the University of California-Riverside's College of Engineering Center for Environmental Research and Technology.""They're such a large producer of fuel in California that if they closed, it would be beyond a crisis,"" said Miller, who worked for Unocal years ago before it was bought by Chevron. ""Still, I'm sure they're concerned about all the fees."" For the cap-and-trade system to be amended or revoked, CARB would have to find alternate ways to reduce emissions, or state legislators would have to repeal the law.Chevron's Wirth said that even if AB 32 is not altered, it is unlikely to have a meaningful impact on climate change.""California, by itself, cannot change the (global) inventory of greenhouse gases,"" Wirth said.Chevron also is lobbying hard for approval to renovate its 105-year-old refinery in Richmond, northeast of San Francisco.  California's safety regulators told Chevron to repair its 245,000 barrel per day Richmond refinery after a 2012 fire that sent thousands to hospitals with respiratory woes but caused no fatalities.The company received preliminary approval to upgrade the refinery in 2008 before a lawsuit was filed by environmental groups. An appeals court ruled in 2010 that Chevron did not properly disclose the type of crude oil the upgraded refinery would process.Effectively, Chevron has proposed a simplified renovation project to replace the refinery's hydrogen plant and smaller parts. It is unclear whether the company will receive approval this time from Richmond officials.""The reality is, these kinds of plants need to be continually upgraded to modern standards for safety and environmental performance,"" Chevron executive Wirth said. ""If you reach a point where you can't continue to do that, it's hard for the facility to continue to be viable.""",2014-03-12,CVX,"Wed Mar 12, 2014 | 7:13pm EDT",Chevron warns California carbon rules will make gasoline too costly,http://www.reuters.com//article/chevron-california-idUSL2N0M81FN20140312?type=companyNews
36,"  * Chevron hasn't filed full report on 2nd incident in offshore field -ANP* Report needed before regulator can approve drilling, injection -ANPBy Jeb BlountANGRA DOS REIS, BRAZIL, March 13 Permission for Chevron Corp to resume drilling and water injection at its Frade offshore field in Brazil is being held up by the company's failure to deliver a full report on the causes of a 2012 oil seepage, the head of Brazil's oil regulator said on Thursday.""They can't get authorization until we get the report and analyze it,"" said Magda Chambriard, director general of the ANP regulatory agency.The report is supposed to explore and explain the reasons for a second leak at Frade, Chambriard said. Frade was the site of a November 2011 accident that resulted in a spill of about 4,600 barrels into the Atlantic Ocean northeast of Rio de Janeiro.Chevron did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The U.S. company has spent more than $2 billion developing Frade, which was once the largest foreign-run oil field in the country. It has a projected capacity to produce about 80,000 barrels of oil and equivalent natural gas a day (boepd). That's more than 3 percent of Brazil's oil and natural gas output or 2.56 million boepd in January, according to the ANP.The field was temporarily shut after a second leak in the area was discovered in March 2012. At the time there was speculation that a pressure ""kick"" that caused the original spill may have caused fractures in rock beneath the sea-bed that led to the new leaks.Chevron said then that it was shutting the well as a precautionary measure and that there was no evidence that the March leaks of several barrels of oil was linked to the November spill. Chevron also said it did not know if the leaks were natural or the result of oil production activity. Small, natural leaks of oil from the ocean floor are common in the Campos Basin, where Frade is located. The Campos Basin is home to more than 80 percent of Brazil's oil output. Natural oil leaks in the area prompted Brazil's state-run oil company, Petroleo Brasileiro SA, to explore for oil in the basin.No oil came near shore and no workers or wildlife were harmed in either event at Frade. ANP officials said there was no sign of negligence by Chevron and that there was no discernable harm to the environment. The original Frade leak in 2011 was less than 0.1 percent of the giant Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010.In 2013, San Ramon, California-based Chevron was allowed to resume output at Frade, but remained under a drilling and injection ban after it explained the reasons for the initial spill and agreed to a series of new procedures and remedial actions in an ""Adjustment of Conduct Agreement."" Injection of water is used to increase reservoir pressure and help increase oil production.Frade, which was producing as much as 72,000 boepd before the November 2011 spill, churned out 21,199 boepd in January, according to the ANP.The adjustment of conduct agreement also resulted in the closing of lawsuits seeking as much as 40 billion reais ($17 billion) in damages for the initial spill and criminal penalties against Chevron, Transocean Ltd., its drilling contractor and 18 Chevron and Transocean employees.Frade is 52 percent owned by Chevron, which is also the field operator. Brazil's state-run oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA owns 30 percent and 18 percent is owned by Frade Japäo, a joint venture between Japanese trading houses Inpex Corp. and Sojitz Corp.",2014-03-14,CVX,"Thu Mar 13, 2014 | 10:44pm EDT",Chevron Brazil oil-drilling permission depends on report delivery -regulator,http://www.reuters.com//article/chevron-brazil-idUSL2N0MB04620140314?type=companyNews

45,"   By Casey Sullivan | NEW YORK, March 31  NEW YORK, March 31 A New York judge has allowed Chevron Corp to sue Patton Boggs over claims that the Washington law and lobbying firm engaged in fraud while trying to enforce a multibillion-dollar environmental judgment for a group of Ecuadorean villagers.U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan gave his ruling on Monday in Manhattan federal court, saying he had ""difficulties"" with Patton Boggs' argument that a New York court did not have jurisdiction to hear the case.""This is about holding accountable all those who are responsible for trying to enforce this travesty of justice that occurred in Ecuador,"" Chevron's lawyer, Randy Mastro, said in an interview. ""Now there will be the opportunity to hold Patton Boggs accountable for its role.""In 2011, an Ecuadorean judge ruled in favor of plaintiff lawyer Steven Donziger against Chevron for polluting the country's rainforest. An award to the villagers for $18 billion was reduced in 2013 to $9.5 billion.Patton Boggs was hired by the villagers in 2010 to come up with a strategy to enforce the judgment, with partner James Tyrrell leading the enforcement efforts, according to court records.

49,"  * Charges had been dropped in 2013 after a settlement* Chevron, 11 employees the subject of reopened case* Oil agency approves Chevron restart of offshore wellsBy Jeb BlountRIO DE JANEIRO, April 4 Brazilian judges ordered a criminal prosecution of Chevron Corp. and 11 employees over an oil spill in Nov. 2011, in a process reinstated more than a year after being thrown out following a settlement with the government.An appeals panel made the 2-to-1 decision in October, but kept it quiet as judges reviewed Chevron's challenges to their ruling, Brazil's public prosecutor's office, which oppposed the dismissal, said on Wednesday.Chevron confirmed the ruling late on Thursday.The case is likely to revive concern over the speed and security of Brazilian legal rulings.The same prosecutor's office that drew up a settlement to help get the charges dropped is now working to re-open the criminal part of the case. Similar, and even larger, spills by other companies in Brazil have not led to criminal charges. ""The prosecutors are trying to show that the defendants' arguments that there is no proof of an environmental crime are wrong,"" the prosecutors said in a statement.Prosecutors say their evidence shows the defendants are responsible for environmental pollution.These pollution routes include the spilling of residues, unauthorized extraction of mineral resources, irregular operations with the potential to pollute, damage to public assets and other crimes, prosecutors said in their statement.Chevron ""continues to believe that the complaint is without merit,"" the San Ramon, California-based company said in an e-mail, adding that it intended to fight the ruling.The prosecutors are not trying to reinstate charges against employees of Chevron's drilling contractor Transocean Ltd , who were named in the original indictment. From the beginning Chevron has said it took full responsibility for the accident. The defendants face up to three decades in jail if convicted.The case now returns to the 10th Federal Criminal Court in Rio de Janeiro. That court threw out the case in January 2013 shortly after Chevron agreed to about $150 million in remedial actions and signed an adjustment-of-conduct accord with prosecutors and Brazil's environment agency over the spill.The spill in the Frade field northeast of Rio de Janeiro leaked an estimated 4,600 barrels of oil into the ocean, less than 1 percent of the giant and deadly Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010.The spill that Brazil's petroleum regulator said had caused no discernible environmental damage, injuries or deaths was also the subject of a controversial civil lawsuit seeking nearly $20 billion in damages. Prosecutors dropped that case in October. Chevron and its partners in Frade had to stop producing for about a year and a half. Brazilian petroleum regulator ANP fined Chevron for failing to follow drilling plans, but absolved it of negligence.""We are confident that once all the facts are fully examined, they will demonstrate that the company responded appropriately and responsibly to the incident and that there is no damage to the environment or risk to human health associated with the incident,"" Chevron said in the statement.The ANP agreed on March 31 to let Chevron restart all its production wells at Frade, Chevron said in a statement.A year ago, the ANP authorized Chevron to start four wells, from which its daily production in February stood at 17,279 barrels of oil and natural gas, about a quarter of 2011 peak output before the spill.Chevron officials were not immediately available to say how many production wells the company has at Frade.Chevron is still barred from operating water-injection wells at Frade, which are used to boost reservoir production. The ANP fears such wells may cause oil leaks through seabed fissures.Chevron owns 52 percent of Frade. Brazil's state-run Petroleo Brasileiro SA owns 30 percent and Frade Japao, a joint venture between Japanese trading houses Inpex Corp  and Sojitz Corp, owns 18 percent.(Editing by Clarence Fernandez)",2014-04-04,CVX,"Fri Apr 4, 2014 | 12:06am EDT","Chevron Brazil faces criminal oil-spill charges, reinstated on appeal",http://www.reuters.com//article/chevron-brazil-idUSL1N0MW05720140404?type=companyNews

53,"  (Adds details on Argentina policy changes, Chevron's Latin America performance)By Ernest Scheyder and Hugh BronsteinNEW YORK/BUENOS AIRES, April 10 Chevron Corp  and state-controlled YPF SA plan to spend an additional $1.6 billion to develop Argentina's Vaca Muerta shale formation further, boosting plans for new wells this year and announcing fresh exploration projects.The project, announced on Thursday, will help Chevron boost its oil and natural gas production, which has been stubbornly flat the past few years despite annual global capital spending of around $40 billion.It should also help ease concerns about foreign investment in Argentina, which was widely castigated after President Cristina Fernandez expropriated Repsol SA's majority stake in YPF two years ago, and should give the country fresh capital to develop one of the largest energy reserves in the Western Hemisphere.Since the start of the year, Argentina has made policy changes that have caught the eye of international investors while sparking a rally in local stocks and bonds. The shifts have included heating gas subsidy cuts of 20 percent, an 18  percent currency devaluation and a deal to pay Repsol $5 billion for the YPF nationalization.Chevron and YPF began drilling in the region last year, with Chevron agreeing to spend $1.24 billion for YPF to drill 161 wells as the project's operator, a deal that was widely seen as a test phase by Wall Street.Chevron and YPF said on Thursday they would jointly spend an additional $1.6 billion to drill 170 wells this year, up from previous estimates for 140 wells this year. Additionally, Chevron will spend $140 million to explore the Narambuena region of the Vaca Muerta.Chevron sought to characterize the announcement as a vote of confidence in the first phase of the project and its high expectations for future production.""YPF is a reliable partner and operator that is advancing the project in the right direction,"" Ali Moshiri, Chevron's head of African and Latin American exploration and production, said in a statement. Moshiri is under pressure to show results in Latin America because of slumping production in Venezuela and a protracted legal fight with Ecuador that shows little signs of abating.Big oil companies, like Chevron, also have had a mixed record of developing shale deposits around the world, with their large bureaucracies often moving slower than small, more-nimble start-up companies to develop unconventional oil and natural gas deposits.Chevron, which has called Vaca Muerta one of the world's most exciting shale plays, has previously forecast production there could jump from around 15,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day at present to 80,000 boed by 2017.Chevron's decision ""is a great demonstration of confidence in the work of YPF and the potential of unconventional hydrocarbons of Argentina,"" Miguel Galuccio, YPF's chief executive officer, said in a statement. The company, which is 51 percent controlled by Buenos Aires, is seen as crucial in helping the South American nation achieve energy independence.Argentina unveiled a new consumer price index this year that more accurately measures stubbornly high inflation, which has also hampered energy development.From 2007 through the end of last year the government reported inflation at about half the rate estimated by private economists. The lack of credibility of official data took a toll on business confidence already battered by falling central bank reserves and heavy-handed currency controls meant to clamp down on access to U.S. dollars.Argentina's stock market has rallied 20 percent so far this year on the back of Buenos Aires' shift toward more investment-friendly policies, while locally traded government debt prices have risen 11 percent.The country, however, remains home to one of the world's highest inflation rates, estimated at over 30 percent. Central bank reserves have fallen 32 percent to $27.6 billion over the last 12 months, triggering criticism from the International Monetary Fund and a credit rating downgrade from Moody's.Shares of Chevron were down 1.6 percent at $117.25, and YPF fell 1 percent to $30.25 on the New York Stock Exchange early Thursday afternoon.  225-819-7371   (Reporting by Ernest Scheyder in New York and Hugh Bronstein in Buenos Aires; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn, Matthew Lewis and Richard Chang)",2014-04-10,CVX,"Thu Apr 10, 2014 | 1:08pm EDT","UPDATE 2-Chevron, YPF boost spending to develop Argentine shale",http://www.reuters.com//article/chevron-ypf-idUSL2N0N20VZ20140410?type=companyNews

55,"   By Hugh Bronstein | BUENOS AIRES, April 17  BUENOS AIRES, April 17 Argentine President Cristina Fernandez is reversing some of the populist policies that defined her first six years in power and will have little choice but to stick to the new, more pragmatic  path over the remaining 20 months of her final term.Confronted by falling dollar reserves, a weak economy and high inflation, Fernandez has in the past three months cut heating gas subsidies and let the peso devalue by 18 percent.She has revamped shoddy official inflation reporting and agreed to pay Spain's Repsol $5 billion for the 2012 nationalization of oil company YPF.Investors long put off by Fernandez's antagonism toward big business are interested in Argentina again and hoping that more prudent government spending could bolster reserves and slow one of the world's highest inflation rates.The policy changes have helped fuel a 19 percent rise in Argentine stocks so far this year and a 9.5 percent rally in local bonds that analysts expect will continue through mid-year.If Fernandez's government follows up with more changes it could put the economy on firmer ground for whoever succeeds her as president late next year. All of the most likely candidates  have more orthodox economic policies than those pursued by Fernandez.The more she cuts subsidies and allows the currency to devalue, the less painful the reform process will be after she leaves office.""What's not clear is whether she wants to do a full fiscal adjustment or just what's necessary to get through her term without a crisis,"" said Mariel Fornoni, a pollster with the Management & Fit consultancy.Up until late 2013 Fernandez vowed to never devalue the peso or adjust fiscal policy, saying ""that way lies chaos."" Her government is playing down the recent policy shift and refuses to say what might come next.Asked by Reuters this week how far the reforms will go, Economy Minister Axel Kicillof, a Marxist academic, shot back: ""In the first place, there have been no reforms. We are not committed to specific policies, but to specific goals ... such as increasing production, employment and the income of our citizens while decreasing inequality.""""These objectives support internal demand and the export sector ... which in turn benefits foreign companies operating in the country,"" he said, abruptly ending a news conference.Some business leaders are convinced the government has no choice but to move further away from the economic model of the last few years.""We saw quite a few policy changes in the first quarter and expect to see more, including more devaluation of the currency,  because they don't have a choice,"" said an executive with a foreign company with more than a billion dollars invested in Argentina, but who asked not to be identified. ""They held off for a long time, but now they are running out of money and need foreign investment,"" the executive said.POPULISM'S RISE AND FALL Since winning the presidency in 2007, Fernandez has used central bank reserves to finance heavy government spending. That worked while there was plenty of money coming in and Argentina's economy was still rebounding from its 2002 sovereign default.But inflation is now running at around 30 percent, growth is weak with many analysts expecting a recession by the end of this year, and central bank reserves are down more than 30 percent over the last 12 months to just $27.7 billion. ""Argentina's problems start and end with its loose fiscal policy,"" said Patrick Esteruelas, sovereign strategist at London-based hedge fund Emso, which has $2 billion under management.He said the government will be helped by an expected record soy harvest over the next two months, and that it could take extra pressure off reserves if it follows the recent policy changes further spending cuts, including a reduction in electricity subsidies.""The soy harvest provides a window of opportunity for the government to continue taking more aggressive corrective measures ahead of the negative seasonality of the second half,"" Esteruelas said. ""The jury is out as to whether they will use this window of opportunity adequately.""Energy and transportation subsidies last year amounted to 5 percent of gross domestic product. Generous state spending had bolstered Fernandez's popularity and helped her easily win re-election in 2011 but economic woes started hitting her popularity over the last two years.Her approval rating has dropped to around 25 percent, according to a recent Management & Fit poll. That slide and growing fears of a new economic crisis were key factors behind the recent policy changes.Fernandez is barred by law from seeking a third term in the  October 2015 election, and she has not yet thrown her support behind any of the likely candidates.Possible candidates include Buenos Aires Governor Daniel Scioli, a Wall Street favorite, and Sergio Massa, a former mayor of Buenos Aires suburb Tigre who has put battling inflation at the top of his agenda.The election line-up has fueled optimism of deeper and longer-term policy changes aimed at boosting investment, especially in the potentially huge Vaca Muerta shale oil and gas field in Patagonia.Chevron Corp last week doubled down on its investment in Vaca Muerta, saying it and YPF plan to spend an extra $1.6 billion on new wells and exploration projects.

Donziger's ""claims of irreparable injury rest on a pastiche of unsupported assertions, contradictions of undisputed evidence and fertile imagination,"" Kaplan's opinion said.Kaplan did grant Donziger narrow relief on one point.He allowed that the shares Donziger holds in a company called Amazonia, organized to collect and distribute any proceeds of Ecuadorean judgment, will be held by the court - not Chevron - pending the final outcome of the appeal.Chevron spokesman Morgan Crinklaw called the attorney's motion to stay ""yet another attempt to delay and distract from the unrebutted evidence against him"" and said the company was confident it would win in the appeals court. Donziger's attorney said he had no comment.The long-running case centers on an oil field in the Amazon jungle, known as Lago Agrio, where Texaco operated from 1964 to 1992. Chevron later acquired Texaco.Chevron asserts that Texaco cleaned up the site before handing it over to a state-controlled company but the villagers say they are still suffering from the legacy of environmental contamination. Donziger has repeatedly accused Kaplan of bias and claimed the judge allowed personal animosity to cloud his decision. He denies the bribery and fraud allegations.The New York ruling does not restrict the villagers from trying to seek enforcement of the Ecuadorean judgment outside the United States.A Canadian court ruled in December that Ontario was a proper jurisdiction for the Ecuadorean plaintiffs to press Chevron to pay up and the country's Supreme Court earlier this month agreed to hear the company's appeal of that ruling.The Ecuadoreans are also pursuing cases in Argentina and Brazil in the hopes of one day seeing a payout from the case.The case is Chevron Corp v.

68,"   By Marianna Parraga | HOUSTON, April 30  HOUSTON, April 30 Argentina's Neuquen province expects major global energy companies, including Royal Dutch Shell, Chevron Corp and Exxon Mobil Corp , to bid in a May auction of 11 oil blocks, its energy minister said on Wednesday.The exploration and development blocks include conventional and unconventional oil and gas resources, most of them in the vast Vaca Muerta shale formation, considered one of the world's biggest shale deposits.The results are expected for August.""For unconventionals, the players will be the majors,"" Neuquen Energy Minister Guillermo Coco said in Houston on a road show to attract foreign capital. ""Chevron, Exxon, Shell have shown interest in Vaca Muerta. They will compete for sure.""Companies interested in participating would have to form joint ventures with the provincial oil company, Gas y Petroleo de Neuquen (GyP), with 50-90 percent stakes, depending on the block size and resources. ""We want to be the minority stakeholders in all the unconventional projects and also be an important stakeholder in conventional developments,"" Coco added.According to Argentine law, it is possible for companies to form consortia to develop conventional and unconventional resources separately in a single block. President Cristina Fernandez has given the provinces more leeway to set up energy development programs, a reflection of the huge resources needed to exploit the fields.The Neuquen basin's crude output was 224,000 barrels per day (bpd) in 2013, more than a third of the country's production, and it also produced 2.2 billion cubic feet per day, according to the regional government's figures.The first bidding round in Neuquen was held from 2008 to 2009 and there have been another two rounds since. At least 57 blocks have been assigned and some of the properties given back to GyP are being re-offered. In the first round, the regional government did not demand access bonds as will be the case in this round. Companies could pay as much as $80 million to access mid-sized areas.The crude produced in the new areas has to be sold to refineries in Argentina through individual supply contracts, the minister added.He expects that this will not be an issue, even though the controlled internal gas price is the cause of frequent complaints from operators working in the country.U.S.-based Chevron has been the most active foreign oil company in Vaca Muerta in partnership with Argentine state-run  company YPF SA.

69,"   By Casey Sullivan | NEW YORK  NEW YORK A New York federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit brought by Patton Boggs accusing Chevron Corp of ""bad faith"" litigation tactics while the Washington law firm tried to enforce a multibillion-dollar pollution judgment. In granting Chevron's motion to dismiss the case, U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan on Tuesday agreed with a 2013 recommendation by U.S. Magistrate Judge James Francis that Patton Boggs did not have legal standing to sue.The lawsuit was the most recent of three that Patton Boggs had filed against Chevron in connection with its efforts to enforce an $18 billion judgment obtained in Ecuador in 2011. Plaintiffs lawyers led by Steven Donziger had claimed Chevron polluted Ecuador's rainforest. The two other lawsuits by Patton Boggs, both in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, were dismissed in 2011. The latest case dates to 2012, when Patton Boggs sued Chevron in Manhattan federal court for what it called ""bad faith"" litigation. It accused the oil company ""cutting off (Ecuadorian plaintiffs') ability to obtain funding"" for legal counsel, and of making misrepresentations in obtaining a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction against the plaintiffs as Patton Boggs sought to enforce the $18 billion judgment.  In April, Chevron asked for the lawsuit to be dismissed, saying that each of Patton Boggs' claims ""fail as a matter-of-law."" Judge Francis recommended that Kaplan grant Chevron's motion. A Patton Boggs spokesman said in a statement on Tuesday, ""We disagree with the Court's ruling"" but noted that ""the decision was expected and does not materially impact the posture of the case.""  A Chevron spokesman said in a statement, ""Chevron now looks forward to proving its claims against Patton Boggs and to hold it accountable for its role in perpetrating this scheme.""     He was referring to the alleged fraud, bribery and extortion used by plaintiffs' lawyers under Donziger in obtaining the Ecuadorian judgment, and the fact that Kaplan had ruled on March 4 that there was ""clear and convincing evidence"" of this behavior.Four weeks later, on March 31, Kaplan allowed Chevron to pursue a case against Patton Boggs accusing the law firm of knowing and concealing allegedly fraudulent tactics used by Donziger's legal team but opting to take the case enforcing the multibillion-dollar judgment anyway.  Referring to that lawsuit on Tuesday, Kaplan said both sides should submit a joint report and proposed schedule for the case going forward by May 22.The case is: Patton Boggs v.

72,"  (Adds unit info, stock price, natural gas data)By Ernest ScheyderMay 2 Sliding production and weak crude oil prices hampered Chevron Corp in the first quarter, leading the second-largest U.S. oil producer, to report a profit well below Wall Street's expectations.Chevron, unlike other large energy companies, derives a larger portion of its U.S. profit from crude oil than natural gas.That has generally helped the company the past few years, when natural gas prices sat near 10-year lows. Yet a bitter cold winter in U.S. during the first quarter pushed up natural gas prices roughly 50 percent over the same quarter in 2013, a rally that left Chevron behind and boosted results for rivals Exxon Mobil Corp and ConocoPhillips. Chevron's average selling price for two key types of crude oil, meanwhile, fell 4 percent.The company posted net income of $4.51 billion, or $2.36 per share, compared with $6.18 billion, or $3.18 per share, in the year-ago quarter. Analysts, though, expected earnings of $2.51 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Globally, Chevron's production fell 2 percent to 2.59 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd). The results stood in contrast to Exxon and ConocoPhillips, which on Thursday posted quarterly profits that beat Wall Street's expectations. Both companies produce more natural gas in the United States than Chevron, and rebounding natural gas prices in the first quarter lifted their respective results.For example, Chevron produced 1.2 million cubic feet of natural gas per day (mcfd) in the last quarter in the U.S., compared with Exxon's 3.4 mcfd produced in the country.Chevron Chief Executive John Watson attributed lower crude oil prices to ""global economic factors"" and pinned much of the drop in production on bad weather in Kazakhstan, where the company is the largest private oil producer and holds stakes in two oil fields.Shares of Chevron rose 0.4 percent to $125.39 in Friday morning trading. As of Thursday's close, the stock had gained about 6 percent in the last six months.

75,"  BUCHAREST May 6 U.S energy major Chevron  has begun drilling for shale gas at its exploration well site in eastern Romania, the company said on Tuesday.Chevron won approval to drill exploratory wells in the small town of Pungesti in the impoverished Romanian county of Vaslui last October but had to halt work when protesting residents blocked access to the site.It resumed work in December, and drilling began last Thursday after completing safety and performance checks, the company said.""Various measurements and rock samples will be taken to determine if natural gas is present and how it may be produced,"" Chevron said in a statement. The U.S. Energy Information Administration estimates Romania could potentially hold 51 trillion cubic feet of shale gas, which would cover domestic demand for more than a century. But hundreds of residents in Vaslui protested against Chevron's plans on concerns that the company would use fracking - the process of injecting water and chemicals at high pressure into underground rock formations to push out gas.Critics, including the Romanian protesters, say it can pollute water supplies and trigger small earthquakes. Advocates say it has a strong safety record and point to countries like the United States, where extensive fracking has driven down energy prices. Chevron, which also has rights to explore three licence blocks near the Black Sea, does not have plans to use fracking -   - under its five-year exploration programme. It says it is abiding by all safety regulations.(Reporting by Radu Marinas; editing by Susan Thomas)",2014-05-06,CVX,"Tue May 6, 2014 | 7:54am EDT",Chevron starts Romania shale exploration drilling,http://www.reuters.com//article/romania-shale-chevron-idUSL6N0NS3CF20140506?type=companyNews

He said ""clients would be given notice and an opportunity to raise any necessary privilege issues"" in the discovery process.""We believe everything we did in this settlement was ethical,"" he said in a separate interview. The case traces back to 2003 when a group of Ecuadorean villagers sued Chevron in the court of Lago Agrio, claiming the oil company was responsible for contaminating their water and soil. The damage was said to have been done by Texaco, which operated in Ecuador from 1964 to 1992. Chevron bought the company in 2001.After years of litigation, an Ecuadorean judge ruled in 2011 against Chevron and awarded villagers $18 billion. An Ecuadorean higher court reduced it to $9.5 billion.In March, a New York federal judge barred Donziger's Ecaudorian clients from enforcing the judgment, at least in the United States. The decision is being appealed.STATEMENT ""PREJUDICES"" FORMER CLIENTS  Patton Boggs was hired by the Ecuadoreans in 2010 to devise a plan to enforce the judgment in the United States and abroad.Between 2011 and 2013, Patton Boggs filed three unsuccessfullawsuits against Chevron over litigation tactics used by the company and its law firm Gibson Dunn & Crutcher during their attempts to prevent enforcement of the judgment.Chevron, in turn, sued Patton Boggs, claiming that firm partners James Tyrrell and Eric Westenberger knew that the judgment was based on a fraudulent environmental report. The lawsuit also said the partners tried to cover it up. Tyrrell and Westenberger did not respond to a request for comment.Patton Boggs's statement of regret, Donziger said, prejudiced the Ecuadoreans and violated New York's Rules of Professional Conduct governing lawyers.Rebecca Roiphe, a law professor at New York Law School, said however, that under the American Bar Association's professional ethics rules, Patton Boggs's expression of regret was acceptable if the firm learned its services were being used to promote a crime or fraud.Patton Boggs is not the first law firm to back out of the Chevron case. Joseph Kohn of Kohn, Swift & Graf stopped working with the villagers in 2009 and later testified that Donziger had lied about the case's legitimacy.Lawyers in other matters have similarly pulled out of cases. But Andrew Perlman, a law professor with Suffolk University, said that major law firms typically do not issue apologies for their work.""It's hard to think of another case quite like it,"" Perlman said.(Additional reporting by Mica Rosenberg; Editing by Ted Botha, Eric Effron and Grant McCool)",2014-05-13,CVX,"Tue May 13, 2014 | 1:13pm EDT",Patton Boggs firm defends role reversal in Chevron pollution case,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-chevron-ecuador-pattonboggs-idUSBREA4C0N620140513?type=companyNews

""It would now seek to find out whether the bid was transparently done and why the winner was not declared,"" Tarfa said, adding the case was adjourned to May 23 for hearing of pending applications, which includes examining the bid process. Brittania-U, run by former Chevron executive Catherine Uju Ifejika, was the highest bidder at over $1 billion for the biggest cluster of five onshore oil blocks being sold by the U.S. group - OML 52, 53 and 55.Chevron had begun talks with the company over the sale. Brittania-U paid an initial deposit of $250 million and provided a binding commitment from Nigerian banks for the balance of the bid price, Tarfa said, but Chevron decided to look at alternative bids, prompting Brittania-U to challenge its decision in court.

83,"   By Casey Sullivan | NEW YORK  NEW YORK A week after concluding a controversial settlement with Chevron Corp, law and lobbying firm Patton Boggs is seeking to close the biggest law firm merger so far this year by as early as next week, according to four sources familiar with the matter.A former Patton Boggs lawyer said the details of the merger with the 1,300-lawyer Squire Sanders firm was being presented to Patton Boggs partners on Friday, and they would vote on it by Wednesday. He and another source said the new firm would be called Squire Patton Boggs.Patton Boggs managing partner Edward Newberry and general counsel Charles ""Rick"" Talisman did not respond to requests for comment. Nor did Squire Sanders chairman James Maiwurm or a spokesman for the firm.The 300-lawyer Patton Boggs firm has been in discussions with Squire Sanders since February after seeing revenue wane and partners defect in 2013. The former Patton Boggs lawyer said some partners were being told they would have to contribute tens of thousands of dollars to the new firm, starting in January 2015. The merger, if approved, was expected to take effect on June 1, he said.He said the name of the new firm indicated Squire Sanders must feel there was brand value in the Patton Boggs name, and that it had not been tarnished by the Chevron case. On May 7, Patton Boggs settled a lawsuit brought by Chevron claiming the law firm tried to enforce a multibillion-dollar pollution judgment on behalf of Ecuadorean villagers against the oil company. Chevron claimed Patton Boggs knew the judgment was obtained through fraudulent means.Patton Boggs agreed to pay Chevron $15 million to settle the claims and expressed regret for its involvement in the case, a move that set the stage for the merger, according to people familiar with the matter. If completed, the merger would provide financial relief to Patton Boggs, which saw revenue decline 12 percent from 2012 to 2013, to $278 million.Another former Patton Boggs lawyer, as well as a person involved in the deal, said a merger would almost certainly lead to layoffs at the firm.(Reporting By Casey Sullivan; Editing by Ted Botha and Noeleen Walder)",2014-05-16,CVX,"Fri May 16, 2014 | 1:48pm EDT",Patton Boggs partners to vote on merger: sources,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-lawyer-pattonboggs-squire-idUSBREA4F0KV20140516?type=companyNews

Patton Boggs agreed to cooperate with Chevron in discovery related to the case and expressed regret for its involvement in the matter.On Wednesday night, the Ecuadoreans filed a motion in New York federal court asking U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan, who accepted the settlement on May 7, to reconsider and issue an order blocking the deal on the grounds that it was unethical. The motion was filed by the villagers' lawyer, Steven Donziger. In March, Kaplan ruled that Donziger had used ""corrupt means,"" including bribery to secure the 2011 judgment. Donziger is appealing.In Wednesday's motion, Donziger said: ""This court should not place its stamp of approval on what amounts to an abandonment of indigent clients."" By expressing regret and providing ""disclosure of client information"" as part of the settlement, Patton Boggs violated professional legal ethical codes ""and is therefore contrary to law and public policy,"" the motion said. Donziger also said the 300-lawyer firm had settled to pave the way for a merger between it and the 1,300-lawyer Squire Sanders.

They said they would begin operating under the name Squire Patton Boggs effective June 1.Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed, but the combined entity would rank 23rd among U.S. law firms with more than $1 billion in revenue, according to financial figures in the American Lawyer and a Patton Boggs memo obtained by Reuters.Patton Boggs was viewed by many in the legal industry, including former partners, as being in need of a rescue, despite a storied history of representing U.S. presidential campaigns, major corporations and governments around the world. Its revenues were slipping and its headcount had shrunk by about half since 2011, down to 300 lawyers.The firm's problems included becoming entangled in a complex case in which Ecuadorean villagers sought to enforce an $18 billion pollution judgment against Chevron Corp (CVX.N). Once seen by the firm as a potential source of lucrative legal fees, the case became a liability and Patton Boggs agreed this month to pay the oil company a $15 million settlement after a court found the judgment had been obtained fraudulently.Its problems also stemmed from the drying up of one major case, defending New York City against health-related claims by firefighters and emergency workers who responded to the September 11, 2001, attacks on the World Trade Center, several former Patton Boggs partners said.Its revenue dropped by 12 percent from 2012 to 2013, to $278 million, according to figures in an internal memo obtained by Reuters in January, and the firm hired restructuring advisers.The firm also struggled under an outdated pay structure and a stagnant demand for lobbyists amid political gridlock, lawyers inside and outside Patton Boggs said.With 1,300 lawyers from Sydney to Bratislava but few in Washington, D.C., Squire Sanders now stands to gain a stronger presence there.

The motion was filed by Steven Donziger, a lawyer for the villagers, who has been an outspoken critic of the firm, claiming it abandoned its duty to its clients.The merger between Patton Boggs and Squire Sanders was conditional on the resolution of the case between Chevron and Patton Boggs, and the late motion caused Squire Sanders to worry the case was not truly resolved, according to one source close to the deal.Fear was spreading that the delayed voting process would mean Patton Boggs partners would become impatient and jump ship, disrupting the deal, according to three former Patton Boggs partners and another source close to the deal. A handful of Patton Boggs partners already had informed their colleagues that they planned to leave, according to two former Patton Boggs partners.Patton Boggs moved quickly, employing prominent New York lawyer Elkan Abramowitz to request a speedy dismissal of the Ecuadoreans' bid to block the Chevron-Patton Boggs settlement. Abramowitz called it a ""publicity stunt"" that was aimed at casting a cloud over Patton Boggs. Meanwhile, Patton Boggs held a special meeting on Thursday to reassure the firm's associates that Squire Sanders's decision to suspend the vote was temporary, according to a former Patton Boggs lawyer.By 11:25 p.m. that night, Patton Boggs managing partner Edward Newberry sent a memo assuring the firm's partners that Squire Sanders had reviewed the Ecuadoreans' motion, planned to disregard it and had resumed voting.By Friday, momentum for the deal had resumed.

90,"   By Ernest Scheyder | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Chevron Corp (CVX.N) is making the oil-rich Permian shale formation a top investment priority, aiming to turn its West Texas acreage into one of its top five assets by 2020, Vice Chairman George Kirkland said in an interview.The move is a return home of sorts for the second-largest U.S. oil company, which has operated in the Permian since the 1920s. But until now, it has been slow to follow rivals in West Texas who over the last five years have deployed new techniques to recover previously unreachable oil.""We have such a good acreage position and we're looking for a high production over a long period of time, Kirkland said. ""In 2020, we'll be looking at (the Permian) as one of our top five assets in the whole company.""As part of a choreographed plan to show Wall Street it's serious about the Permian, Chevron is taking the rare step of holding its 2014 shareholder meeting in the small city of Midland, Texas, next Wednesday.While Chevron has invested billions of dollars in energy projects across Africa, Asia and South America in recent years, investors have grown anxious as smaller independent oil and natural gas companies, including Chesapeake Energy (CHK.N) and Continental Resources (CLR.N), successfully developed shale plays across the U.S. More than half of Chevron's 1.5 million Permian acres don't require royalty payouts to landowners, an advantage over rivals like Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD.N) and Concho Resources (CXO.N). That will help boost returns as Chevron looks to lift Permian production 67 percent to 250,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day by 2020.Because Chevron chose not to sell its Permian holdings during low prices of the 1980s, it already was sitting on land prime for hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling, but the slow development was a frustration for analysts. ""We have now done a lot of appraisal work, both us directly, and indirectly by those drilling around us,"" Kirkland said. ""If you're in a hydrocarbon producing area, technology will allow you over time to increase productivity. That underlying belief is really coming to fruition for us.""Chevron, which held its annual meeting last year near its California headquarters, hopes to assuage Wall Street's concerns at the Midland event.The meeting could help Wall Street better gauge how the Permian assets fit in the Chevron portfolio, which for years has been focused outside the United States. If sold, Chevron's Permian acreage could be worth about $11.1 billion, less than some rivals, but enough to boost the company's stock by as much as $10 per share, Raymond James analyst Pavel Molchanov estimates.A sale, Kirkland said, is unlikely as Chevron would have a hard time finding a similar project elsewhere in the world in which to invest.""We have an advantaged position,"" he said. ""I don't want to sell an advantaged position.""(Editing by Terry Wade and Bernadette Baum)",2014-05-25,CVX,"Sun May 25, 2014 | 7:08am EDT",Chevron sees Permian shale play as top five asset by 2020,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-chevron-permian-priority-idUSBREA4O04S20140525?type=companyNews
91,"   By Ernest Scheyder | MIDLAND Texas  MIDLAND Texas Shareholders of Chevron Corp (CVX.N), the second-largest U.S. oil company, rejected a proposal on Wednesday to split the roles of chairman and chief executive, both currently held by John Watson.The vote casts further doubt on the long-running campaign by shareholder activists to force large U.S. corporations to separate the positions, which they say would support greater oversight and transparency.Similar proposals have been rejected by shareholders at JPMorgan (JPM.N), Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) and other corporations in the past year, further consolidating power among top leaders.

Last month a major rupture on a flare line triggered a facility-wide shutdown.""Following investigation into the incident that took place at the plant in Soyo on 10 April 2014, Angola LNG will pull forward a planned shutdown to allow its contractor Bechtel to both correct items from the incident and - in parallel - address plant capacity issues,"" the spokesman said. It is expected that this work will continue into next year, with the plant expected to restart in mid 2015, he added.Reuters reported last week that Angola LNG had approached shipbrokers to lease out its entire tanker fleet, signalling a prolonged inability of the plant to produce fuel for export. Reacting to news of the shutdown, a shipping source on Wednesday said the availability of so much shipping capacity would weigh on already-depressed rental rates.""Massively negative for LNG shipping to see Angola vessels trade spot for 12 months,"" he said.Chevron has a 36.4 percent share in the plant, while Angolan state oil firm Sonangol has 22.8 percent.

There, it will meet the Pacific Trail Pipeline planned by the two partners backing the LNG project. The proposed line is the fourth in the works by TransCanada to supply northern British Columbia's nascent natural gas industry, which plans to liquefy the abundant shale-gas reserves in the province's north for export to high-paying markets in Asia and elsewhere. None of the handful of planned projects have received final approval from their backers.TransCanada said the line, which is conditional on Chevron and Apache proceeding with their LNG project at Kitimat, B.C., could be in service in early 2020, provided it receives timely regulatory approvals.

98,"   By Nia Williams | CALGARY Alberta  CALGARY Alberta Canada is enjoying an unexpected boom in production of ultra-light crude known as condensate, defying long-held predictions of dwindling supply.This surprising bounty from one corner of Alberta, better known as the home to Canada's vast tar-like oil sands reserves, is a boon for firms like Vermilion Energy Inc and Chevron who have built up positions in the Duvernay, now hotly tipped as one of North America's most exciting shale plays with vast reserves waiting to be tapped.It also is fuelling hope of cost relief for traditional heavy oil sands companies such as Cenovus Energy Inc, who in the past have paid premiums of up to $25 a barrel to buy imported condensate used to dilute their viscous oil sands production so that it can flow through pipelines.The change in outlook has been abrupt. A year ago, the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers expected condensate production to shrink from 139,000 barrels per day to barely 100,000 bpd by 2025, according to its annual forecast.The group's updated forecasts, due out next week, will likely show a very different trajectory, according to Greg Stringham, vice president of oil sands and markets.""(Condensate) had been in decline. We are now seeing relatively strong growth,"" he said. He declined to give exact numbers until the report is released on Monday. In April, Canada's National Energy Board said it expected output to rise 13 percent this year to 172,000 bpd.While the growth is modest compared to the shale revolution that is upending the U.S. industry in places like North Dakota and Texas, its impact may reverberate far south of the border.Rising domestic supply is coming at a time of lower than expected demand for imported U.S. diluent because more companies are moving to ship bitumen by rail, which doesn't necessarily need to be diluted, instead of pipeline.As a result, the trends may further depress U.S. condensate prices and thus add to mounting political pressure to relax U.S. rules barring overseas exports.Along with a newly reversed Cochin pipeline that will start delivering up to 95,000 barrels per day of U.S. condensate from Illinois to Alberta in July, some producers are growing hopeful that prices may finally begin to ease.""I don't believe there's such a thing as cheap condensate. But all other things being equal, more supply coming into the basin should be a positive thing for the buyer,"" said Rick Dembicki, director of crude oil marketing at Cenovus, which sources half its condensate from outside the province. A LONG WAY TO DUVERNAY Condensate supply, though small, plays a critical role in the growth of Canadian oil sands, the world's third-largest crude reserves behind Saudi Arabia and Venezuela.Because raw bitumen is too heavy and thick to flow easily through pipelines, it must be blended with around 30 percent of a lighter oil, known as diluent. A number of different types of hydrocarbons can do the job - including condensate, natural gasoline and synthetic crude oil. The diluent is then stripped out by refiners or terminal operators at the destination, often to be pumped back to Canada and blended again.With oil sands production expected to nearly double over the next decade, demand for diluent is expected to surge to around 900,000 bpd in 2025, consultancy Wood Mackenzie said. Other forecasters suspect demand will be over 1 million bpd.Thanks to the recent boom in the Duvernay formation, a growing share of that may be met with Canadian condensate.Last month, Canada's Encana Corp said the northern Simonette area of the Duvernay was producing up to 400 barrels of liquids per million cubic feet of gas, more than twice the 150 barrels per million it had expected. Chevron's well performance and yields in the Duvernay had exceeded expectations with initial production rates of 1,300 barrels of condensate per day, Jeff Shellebarger, North America Exploration and Production, said last October. A Chevron spokesman said that was the latest production estimate.Western Canada could produce 375,000 bpd of condensate by 2025, with 200,000 bpd coming from the Duvernay under the most optimistic scenario, said Wood Mackenzie analyst Mark Oberstoetter.""That will mean less money that Alberta operators will have to pay in the United States to ship it up,"" Oberstoetter said.DIFFS AT A DISCOUNT At the moment Canada uses for diluent about 200,000 to 250,000 bpd of condensate, most of that imported from the United States. Much of it travels more than 4,000 kilometres (2,485 miles) from the U.S. Gulf Coast, where supply is abundant. The added transport costs mean condensate has typically commanded a premium in Alberta, though it trades at a discount in Texas. Because supplies are tight and existing pipeline shipments can be difficult to predict, prices are often volatile. At times condensate in the Alberta trading hub of Edmonton spiked as high as $25 per barrel over U.S. benchmark futures about five years ago and in recent years premiums have touched $15 dollars.But the growth in local production coupled with the rise of oil-by-rail and the imminent reversal of Kinder Morgan Energy Partners LP's Cochin pipeline may shave that.The premium dropped from an average of $10.23 per barrel in 2011 to $3.72 per barrel in 2013, according to a presentation from Cenovus. On Thursday, condensate was pegged at a $3 discount because of strong supply from the 180,000 bpd Enbridge Inc Southern Lights pipeline from Chicago, Illinois, and lower blending requirements during the warm summer months.""The price of condensate has historically been plus $5 to $10 per barrel. I think that's a thing of the past and it's dropping to par with WTI,"" said John Homan, senior marketing and logistics representative at Calgary-based Laricina Energy Ltd.RAIL DENTS DEMAND For the moment, the growth in Canadian output looks too minimal to disrupt plans for more imports, such as the Cochin reversal and a proposal by Enbridge to boost capacity on its Southern Lights pipeline to 275,000 bpd.But demand forecasts are in flux as producers look for innovative ways to trim their use of the costly diluent. More companies are embracing rail as an alternative to congested crude export pipelines and using heated and coiled cars to ship bitumen raw, requiring no diluent, or as ""railbit,"" which blends just under 20 percent diluent into each barrel.An estimated 1.1 million bpd of rail loading capacity will be available in Western Canada by year-end, if proposed terminal projects stick to construction schedules.Companies such MEG Energy and Gibson Energy Inc are running pilot projects to develop partial upgrading technology and diluent recovery units that would also reduce demand. Meanwhile, on the supply side CNOOC Ltd subsidiary Nexen Inc is selling light oil from its Long Lake project into the Alberta diluent market.

100,"   By Ernest Scheyder | June 10  June 10 Chevron Corp plans to nearly double its donation to Nigerian social projects over the next five years, part of a choreographed plan to improve the local economy and bolster the company's supply chain in the African country, its second-largest source of crude oil.Chevron is donating $40 million to the Niger Delta Partnership Initiative (NDPI), a nonprofit it helped form in 2010 with $50 million in seed money. The second round of funding will make NDPI the largest recipient of Chevron donations in the company's history, executives said.The NDPI works with local organizations in the Niger River Delta to help cull HIV transmission rates, teach cassava farmers marketing techniques and connect catfish breeders with feed suppliers, among other projects.The militant group Boko Haram, which is trying to create an Islamic state in northern Nigeria and recently kidnapped more than 200 girls, has had little effect on southern Nigeria and the Delta, executives and analysts said.Still, criminal gangs have stolen oil and kidnapped residents for more than a decade in the Delta, risks that Chevron and Royal Dutch Shell, the largest foreign oil company in Nigeria, have had to address. ""Our objective is for peace in the Delta. And the best way we can contribute to peace, in our view, is the way we're participating in NDPI,"" said Rhonda Zygocki, Chevron's executive vice president of policy and planning.Chevron has pumped oil in Nigeria, Africa's largest energy producer, for more than 40 years.In 2013, the company pumped more crude oil in Nigeria than any other country in which it operates besides the United States, the second year in a row the country has held such import for the company. Chevron's production, part of a partnership with Nigeria's state-controlled oil company, has more than doubled in the past seven years to 268,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, according to regulatory filings.The NDPI operates in nine Nigerian states along the Gulf of Guinea, though it is headquartered in the capital of Abuja, in the country's geographic center. Using the Chevron donation, NDPI finds small charities on the ground and partners with them on various issues.For example, the nonprofit gave $59,978 to Forward Africa in 2011 for a project designed to help residents of Nigeria's Imo and Abia states get more involved in local government. Forward Africa contributed $5,672 of its funds for the project.While NPDI works with local banks to obtain financing for some Nigerian projects, it tries to encourage local markets to thrive without Chevron's influence, said Dennis Flemming, NDPI's director""We try not to distort a market when we do something here,"" Flemming said.Chevron and foundation staff acknowledged that donations to communities in areas where the company operates are expected, though they said it is not part of a quid pro quo arrangement to obtain access to energy reserves.

106,"  (The writer is a Reuters columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)By John WasikCHICAGO, June 23 Despite the incendiary conflict in Iraq that last week sent the benchmark price of Brent crude oil to more than $115 a barrel, a nine-month high, U.S. stock markets largely shrugged off the oil threat, hitting record closing highs last week.For investors, a new energy crisis in the Middle East presents something of an opportunity, albeit a fragile, short-term one.Energy production has become much more geographically diverse, particularly in the United States. That lessens the severity of a Mideast production shortfall while boosting the long-term prospects of investment in fossil-fuel companies.As is the case during any threat to global oil production - Iraq is still OPEC's second-largest producer - the share prices of oil companies and the funds that invest in them soar on bad news, which is what happened last week. Petroleum producers score in the short term when this happens.Owing to greater demand for oil and geopolitical tensions, ExxonMobil Corp, the largest energy company by market valuation, climbed 10.5 percent over the three months through June 20, compared to a 5.3 percent gain in the S&P 500 Index. BP PLC (the ADR) was up nearly 15 percent over the three months ended June 20.The last three months are important because they include a spate of good reports on economic growth in Europe and the U.S. and a run-up to the political strife in the Middle East. These events, and growing demand from developing countries such as China and India, have pressured oil prices upward. The Vanguard Energy ETF, which holds a broad portfolio of oil and gas exploration, refining and pipeline companies, gained 16 percent in the quarter through June 20. It holds companies like ExxonMobil, Chevron Corp and Schlumberger NV, and nearly all its holdings are based in North America. It's up about 16 percent in the three months through June 20.For a fund that's not dominated by the most popular energy stocks, consider the Guggenheim S&P 500 Equal Weight Energy ETF , which holds a global portfolio of energy producers in roughly equal proportions.The Guggenheim portfolio places more emphasis on smaller, lesser-known companies like Newfield Exploration Co, Anadarko Petroleum Corp and Nabors Industries Ltd . The fund is up nearly 16 percent for the three months through June 20. Independent companies like these may have more drilling activities in the areas where shale oil and gas are being discovered throughout North America. ENERGY SHOCK BOOMERANG Over a short period of time, it makes sense to hold energy stocks as a defense against rising oil prices. After all, companies make profits on price surges.But on the consumer level, higher petroleum prices can act as a damaging boomerang. When prices soar beyond a certain level, it brakes economic activity across the board. Higher fuel prices force people to drive less and stay away from stores, raise prices for everything from farm goods to plastics, and act as a tax on economic growth.During the last draconian oil-price run-up in 2008 - when crude oil prices topped $140 a barrel - the combination of an energy shock, a banking/credit meltdown and massive unemployment from Athens to San Francisco created a recession in Europe and North America. Towards the end of that year, energy prices bludgeoned an already-hobbled economic situation and the Vanguard Energy fund lost nearly 40 percent of its value, slightly more than the S&P 500 Index.Looking ahead, what may mitigate any traumas in terms of oil prices will be growing U.S. oil and gas production, particularly in regions where ""fracking"" technology has liberated more hydrocarbons from shale formations from the Appalachians to North Dakota.Production in the U.S. was up a record 1.1 million barrels per day last year, offseting declines in global output from Libya, Nigeria and Iraq - all due to political strife.""The huge investments seen in the U.S. have been encouraged and enabled by a favorable policy regime,"" BP economist Christof Ruhl told Reuters. ""And this has resulted in the U.S. delivering the world's largest increase in oil production last year. Indeed, the U.S. increase ... was one of the biggest annual oil production increases the world has ever seen.""Across the globe, the future for energy stocks is positive long term. Consumers in China, India and Africa are buying petroleum-hungry vehicles. And until less-costly alternatives present themselves, fossil fuels will power the engines of these developing economies.Short-term political conflicts are unlikely to extinguish these trends.

107,"  PUNGESTI Romania Greenpeace activists chained themselves to the gates of a Chevron shale gas exploration well in eastern Romania on Monday, blocking access to the site and urging the leftist government to ban fracking.Romania could potentially hold 51 trillion cubic feet of shale gas, which would cover domestic demand for more than a century, the U.S. Energy Information Administration estimates. U.S. energy major Chevron began work on the exploration well in the village of Pungesti in eastern Romania in December, after postponing operations several times because of protests from hundreds of local residents.Protesters say they are concerned Chevron will use fracking, or hydraulic fracturing - the process which helps retrieve gas trapped in tight layered underground rock formations by injecting high-pressure water, sand and chemicals.Critics say it can pollute water supplies and trigger small earthquakes. Advocates say it has a strong safety record and point to countries like the United States, where extensive fracking has driven down energy prices. Chevron, the first company to begin exploring for shale gas in European Union member Romania, aims to put up more wells in the area and has repeatedly said it does not plan to use fracking under its five-year exploration program.On Monday, about 25 Greenpeace activists from Romania, Hungary, Austria, the Czech Republic, Poland, Slovakia and Germany descended on the Pungesti site. Wearing bright yellow jackets, the activists blocked access to the road and chained themselves to the tall gates, which have barbed wire on top. They waved banners that said ""Pungesti-anti-Chevron quarantine area"" and ""Stop fracking"".Several police officers were sent to the site but have not yet taken steps to remove the activists.

Chevron has since allowed about 375 stations to resume sales. It is working to determine how to pull gasoline from 125 affected stations. ""When it became clear we were having a problem we suspended the sales,"" he said.Regular gasoline was not affected.

The prices rose despite a small build in inventories on the West Coast as reported by EIA earlier on Wednesday.There were no injuries due to the fire. A massive fire at the refinery in August 2012 sent a plume of smoke over Richmond, a densely populated industrial suburb of San Francisco, leading to thousands of people being sent to hospital emergency rooms. It also caused a prolonged outage which affected local gasoline prices.Any lengthy disruption in production at the third-largest refinery in California could affect the supply of fuel on the U.S. West Coast, particularly gasoline, due to the difficulty in meeting California's super-clean specifications. The region also has few immediate sources of alternative supply. Chevron's proposal to upgrade the refinery to broaden its fuel slate is currently under review by the Richmond City Council.

119,"  (The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.)By John WasikCHICAGO, July 21 All too often, I see investors heading in the wrong direction en masse. They buy stocks at the top of the market or bonds when interest rates are heading up.Occasionally, though, active investors may be heading in the right direction. A case in point has been the flow of money into certain exchange-traded funds in the first half of this year.Reflecting most hot money trends, billions of dollars moved because of headlines. The Energy Select SPDR exchange-traded fund, which I discussed three weeks ago, gathered more than $3 billion in assets in the first half, when crude oil prices climbed and demand for hydrocarbons remained high.The Energy SPDR, which charges 0.16 percent for annual management expenses and holds Exxon Mobil Corp, Chevron Corp and Schlumberger NV, has climbed 22 percent in the past 12 months, with nearly one-third of that gain coming in the three months through July 18. Long-term, this may be a solid holding as developing countries such as China and India demand more oil.""We think the Energy Select SPDR is a play of oil prices remaining high and supporting growth for integrated oil & gas and exploration and production companies,"" analysts from S&P Capital IQ said in a recent ""MarketScope Advisor"" newsletter.Headlines also favored European stocks as represented by the Vanguard FTSE Developed Markets ETF, which holds leading eurozone stocks such as Nestle SA, Novartis AG  and Roche Holding AG. The fund has been the top asset gatherer thus far this year, with $4 billion in new money, according to S&P Capital IQ.As Europe continues to recover over the next few years and the European Central Bank keeps rates low, global investors will continue to benefit from this growing optimism. The Vanguard fund has gained nearly 16 percent for the 12 months through July 18. It charges 0.09 percent in annual expenses and is a solid holding if you have little or no European exposure in your stock portfolio.RATE HIKES Not all hot money trends make sense, however. As the economy accelerates and interest-rate hikes look increasingly likely, investors are still piling money into bond funds, which lose money under those circumstances. The iShares 7-10 Year Treasury Bond ETF, which holds middle-maturity U.S. Treasury bonds, continued to rank in the top 10 funds in terms of new money in the first half. The fund, which holds nearly $5 billion, is up nearly 4 percent for the 12 months through July 18, compared with 4.2 percent for the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Total return index, a benchmark for U.S. Treasuries. The fund charges 0.15 percent in annual expenses.While investors were able to squeeze a bit more out of bond returns in the first half of this year, they may be living on borrowed time.The U.S. Federal Reserve confirmed recently that it would be ending purchases of U.S. Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities in October. This stimulus program, known as ""QE2,"" has kept interest rates artificially low as the economy has had a chance to recover.The phasing out of QE2 could be bearish for bond funds. Will interest rates climb to reflect growing demand for credit and possibly higher inflation down the road? How will the ending of the Fed's cheap money program affect U.S. and emerging markets shares?Many pundits believe public corporations may pull back from their enthusiastic stock buybacks and trigger a correction. Yet low inflation and modest employment gains may mute bond market fears.""The Fed is on track to complete tapering in the fourth quarter, and we think there is essentially no chance that it will move the fed funds rate higher this year,"" Bob Doll, chief equity strategist with Nuveen Investments in Chicago, said in a recent newsletter.""With the 10-year Treasury ending the quarter at 2.5 percent, the yield portion of this forecast is more uncertain,"" Doll added, ""although we expect yields will end the year higher than where they began.""While there could be any number of wild cards spoiling the party for stocks, it is wise to ignore short-term trends and prepare for the eventual climb in interest rates.That means staying away from bond funds with long average maturities along with vehicles like preferred stocks and high-yield bonds that are highly sensitive to interest rates.Longer-term, shares of companies in consumer discretionary, materials and information technology businesses likely to benefit from a global economic resurgence will probably be a good bet.Just keep in mind that the hot money can be wrong, so build a long-haul diversified portfolio that protects against the downside of a torrid trend going from hot to cold.

120,"  * South Korea's GS Caltex, Japan's Cosmo Oil buy one cargo each - sources* US oil exports to benefit energy-deficit allies in Asia - analyst   (Adds quotes, details)By Florence Tan and Meeyoung ChoSINGAPORE/SEOUL, July 24 South Korea and Japan have purchased the first condensate, or ultra-light oil, from the United States since the easing of a 40-year-old ban on U.S. crude oil exports, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday.The U.S. has recently softened a total ban on crude oil exports in place since the Arab oil embargo of the 1970s, allowing energy companies to export a variety of ultra-light oil if it has been minimally refined. Refined products, such as gasoline and diesel, are not restricted.The relaxation of the ban coincides with a resurgence in domestic shale oil and gas production as the U.S. seeks to assure energy importers in Europe and Asia of alternative sources of supply. Energy hungry nations, grappling with disruption fears as geopolitical crises in Eastern Europe and the Middle East deepen, would welcome steady shipments of oil and gas from a stable exporter such as the U.S. ""It means very little in itself, but because of current events it takes on a more political or symbolic importance,"" said Alex Yap, a senior oil analyst at FGE.""If the U.S. wants its allies to be less dependent on the likes of Russia and Iran, it has to show some willingness to step up as a supplier instead of keeping the bounty from shale production within its own market."" South Korean oil refiner GS Caltex has bought a condensate cargo to be loaded in late July, three industry sources with knowledge of the matter said. They declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter.The cargo was marketed by Japanese trading house Mitsui & Co Ltd, which had bought it from Enterprise Product Partners.GS Caltex declined to comment. South Korea's second-largest refiner with a capacity of 775,000 barrels per day (bpd) is equally owned by the No.2 U.S. oil company Chevron Corp and South Korea's GS Energy, a unit of GS Holdings.Japanese refiner Cosmo Oil Co has also bought a cargo of U.S. condensate, an industry source familiar with the matter said earlier on Thursday.The 300,000-barrel cargo will be loaded in August, and is set to arrive at Cosmo's 112,000 bpd Yokkaichi refinery in early October, the source said.The cargo was priced at a few dollars a barrel discount to the similar Middle Eastern grades, the source added.

The U.S. Labor Department reported that 209,000 jobs were created in July, below the 233,000 that economists had expected, while data from the Institute for Supply Management showed that  manufacturing had its fastest expansion in more than three years in July.Strong economic data has recently been viewed as a sign that the Fed might raise rates sooner than previously anticipated. Fears of a rate hike sparked Thursday's decline, which wiped out the Dow's entire gains so far this year.""We have conflicting reports about when the Fed might or might not move, and on top of that we still have a lot of geopolitical issues that the market has to deal with,"" said Nick Sargen, chief economist at Fort Washington Investment Advisors in Cincinnati. ""I wouldn't use this weakness to add to positions. We're still not cheap by any means, and this could be the start of the 10 percent correction that's been long overdue.""With the day's decline, the S&P 500 is about 3.6 percent away from the all-time closing high it posted on July 24.The Dow Jones industrial average fell 111.64 points, or 0.67 percent, to 16,451.66, the S&P 500 lost 12.95 points, or 0.67 percent, to 1,917.72, and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 41.25 points, or 0.94 percent, to 4,328.53.

Data showed 209,000 jobs were created in July, below the 233,000 that was expected. Analysts had speculated that a stronger-than-expected report would give the Fed flexibility to hike rates. Such a move would raise borrowing costs for individuals and companies and crimp spending, which could impact economic growth.The jobs report ""won't force the Fed to raise rates any time soon, and given all the fear that was out there yesterday, it makes sense to me that futures would come back so strongly,"" said Mark Grant, managing director at Southwest Securities in Fort Lauderdale.Other data pointed to improving economic conditions, including the Institute for Supply Management's read on manufacturing, which expanded at the fastest pace in more than three years in July. Factory activity expanded in July, according to financial data firm Markit, though the pace of growth slipped from the prior month. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 25.11 points or 0.15 percent, to 16,538.19, the S&P 500 gained 0.45 points or 0.02 percent, to 1,931.12 and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 4.77 points or 0.11 percent, to 4,365.00.The day's top-performing sectors were all defensive, which tend to outperform in periods of economic uncertainty.Consumer staples rose 1.1 percent as the strongest group on the day, followed by utilities, up 1 percent. Energy shares, a cyclical group that is tied to the pace of economic growth, were the weakest, off 0.6 percent. Thursday's decline was the biggest one-day drop for the S&P since April, and it turned the Dow negative for the year. Despite Friday's rebound, the S&P remained under its 50-day moving average, a sign of weak near-term trends.For the week, the Dow is down 2.6 percent, the S&P is down 2.5 percent and the Nasdaq is down 2 percent. It is the biggest weekly decline for all three since April.A pair of Dow components reported earnings that topped expectations, with Procter & Gamble Co rising 3.4 percent to $79.93 but Chevron dipping 0.8 percent to $128.16.Scientific Games Corp rose 11 percent to $9.50 after it said it would buy Bally Technologies Inc for $3.27 billion.

131,"  SINGAPORE Aug 11 Singapore-based upstream oil and gas firm KrisEnergy Ltd said on Monday it has agreed a $65 million deal to buy out Chevron Corp's  interest in an offshore oil block in Cambodia and take over as the block's operator.KrisEnergy said in a statement it plans to acquire the entire issued share capital of Chevron Overseas Petroleum (Cambodia) Ltd, a subsidiary of the global oil company.The deal is subject to regulatory approvals. Other partners in the joint venture, MOECO Cambodia Co. Ltd and GS Energy Corporation, have approved the transaction, KrisEnergy said. Once the deal is completed, KrisEnergy will increase its stake in Cambodia Block A from 25 percent to 52.25 percent.   The block is located in the Gulf of Thailand, where Chevron struck oil a decade ago - the first significant oil discovery in Cambodia's history.But the launch of production has been delayed for years, as Chevron, the operator of the block, failed to reach an agreement with the government on a final investment decision. KrisEnergy said it intends to work with the Cambodian authorities to agree the terms and conditions of the production licence before declaring a final investment decision. The best estimate contingent resources, or potentially recoverable quantity of petroleum, attributable to KrisEnergy's enlarged stake in the project, will be about 5.4 million barrels of oil equivalent as of the end of 2013, KrisEnergy said.KrisEnergy shares jumped 2.7 percent to S$0.75, the largest daily rise in over a month, but they have fallen more than 40 percent so far this year.

132,"  VIENNA Aug 12 A final investment decision on OMV and Chevron's problematic Rosebank oil project in the North Sea may not take place next year as hoped, OMV said on Tuesday.OMV had said in February it expected to reach a decision in 2015 on the deepwater project, whose development Chevron said last year was not economically attractive. The Austrian company had estimated the costs at $10 billion.Concerns over high costs have raised questions about the future of North Sea developments, and both Chevron and Royal Dutch Shell have announced job cuts at their North Sea oil operations in Aberdeen, Scotland.But Chevron said last month it would continue to focus on flagship projects including Rosebank, although the final investment decision (FID) has already been postponed once to next year from this year. ""FID on this project I don't expect this year. I expect by the end of the year to be clear on whether or not we'll take FID or not next year,"" OMV head of exploration and production Jaap Huijskes told analysts on a webcast call.""The claim was that costs were out of control.

133,"   By Mike Stone | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Chevron Corp (CVX.N) has been searching for up to $1.5 billion of equity investment to help develop its Duvernay shale formation assets in Canada and contacted potential investors including private equity firms, according to people familiar with the matter.Chevron’s subsidiary, Chevron Canada Limited, has exploration leases for approximately 330,000 net acres (1,335 square km) in the Duvernay shale formation. The area is located about 124 miles (200 km) northwest of Edmonton, Alberta.The San Ramon, California-based oil and gas company has sent an offering memorandum to potential investors over the summer, said the people, who asked not to be named because the discussions were private.Because oil and gas developments take many years to generate a return for their investors, Chevron was looking for an equity investor with a long-term investment horizon, the people said. A representative for Chevron declined to comment.Chevron announced in October that its initial exploration of the Kaybob area of the Duvernay shall formation was complete. At the time, the company said the next step was transitioning to a two-rig drilling program to optimize well and completion design. A potential equity injection would help Chevron diffuse the development risk for the next phase of the project. Chevron commenced an exploration program in the Duvernay in 2011 and, as of August 2014, had drilled 15 wells, completed 13 using multi-stage hydraulic fracturing, and tied in 10 wells to existing third-party processing facilities. Hydraulic fracturing is more expensive than traditional extraction methods.Some private equity firms had looked at the opportunity to provide an equity investment into the Duvernay project, but may not ultimately partner with Chevron because of the long investment horizon, according to the people familiar with the matter. Chevron has recently bulked up its acreage in the Duvernay by 20 percent. In August, the company purchased the interests of Alta Energy Luxembourg, which had nearly 68,000 acres. New York-based private equity firm Blackstone Group LP (BX.N) was an investor in Alta Energy.Other lease owners in the Duvernay shale formation include Penn West Petroleum Ltd (PWT.TO), Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSa.L) and Athabasca Oil Corp (ATH.TO).

134,"  * U.S. shale gas boom to increase global LNG supply* Wary Asian buyers hold off on long-term contracts* Chevron has contracts for only 65 pct of $54 bln Gorgon outputBy Oleg Vukmanovic  and Jacob Gronholt-PedersenMILAN/SINGAPORE, Aug 26 U.S. oil major Chevron is struggling to lock-in 20-year sales contracts for its Gorgon liquefied natural gas (LNG) export plant in Australia, the world's most expensive, as buyers spoiled for choice by new suppliers hold out for cheaper deals.The high level of unsold LNG shows how the U.S. shale gas boom has played havoc with major investments now coming to fruition in Australia, and threatens to undermine the industry's traditional sales model where projects tie up forward sales in long-term contracts.Nearly $200 billion worth of gas projects are nearing completion in Australia, with seven LNG projects due to start exporting gas between late 2014 and 2017, making the country the world's largest producer of the fuel.As well as Gorgon, other projects include BG Group's  Curtis Island, Conoco and Origin's Australia Pacific, Inpex's Ichthys, Shell's Prelude and Santos' Gladstone.But with LNG exports from the United States due to begin next year, buyers are more cautious about locking in 20-25 year contracts. For the Australian mega-projects, already stung by soaring costs, this means more uncertainty.""Buyers are being very cautious about firming up long-term import deals, especially since U.S. prices are undercutting Australian projects coming onstream around the same time,"" said a source at a large Asian LNG seller, who asked not to be named.""There's a lot of confusion about which are the best deals given there are so many pricing options on offer from different regions,"" he added.At a price-tag of $54 billion, Chevron's Gorgon project is expected to start up in mid-2015 but has so far locked in sales for just 65 percent of its share of capacity, which leaves it highly exposed to the risk of falls in the spot price. Chevron intends to trade its unsold long-term output on the spot market. Given the huge cost of development, LNG project backers usually look to lock in contracts for at least 85 percent of production, guaranteeing a fixed return for the bulk of their output. Gorgon has locked in sales with Japanese utilities including Tokyo Gas and Chubu Electric, which have both stakes in the project.""With the degree of uncertainty that there is about U.S. exports and the size of U.S. exports, I think you can understand why buyers might want to wait a little bit to see how that all lands out before going forward to secure longer-term contracts,"" Chevron Chief Financial Officer Pat Yarrington told a recent briefing.However, the company acknowledged the difficulties it faced, saying it would prefer to move buyers to a longer-term sales contract ""if we get the right kind of pricing,"" according to George Kirkland, executive vice-president of the upstream gas division. Chevron declined further comment.RISING DEMAND  Chevron initially planned to sell at least 85 percent of Gorgon output to long-term customers, betting that rising demand in the world's biggest LNG consumer, Asia, would keep prices high enough to pay back project costs, originally pegged at $37 billion in 2009.Two events radically changed that calculation. An unconventional drilling boom has transformed the United States into the world's top natural gas producer and opened the door to substantial exports of LNG - already deals have been signed to sell in excess of 30 million tonnes of U.S. LNG, equal to about a third of Japan's annual imports.A wave of new supply globally is also weighing on long-term prices, at a time when Asian demand growth is slowing.Chevron's prediction that global LNG demand will almost double by 2025 - requiring more than 100 million tonnes of new supply - may be true, but will not guarantee it an easy ride.Facing the same problem, rival Woodside Petroleum Ltd, which is developing the Browse floating LNG project in Australia,  is building an LNG trading business, including a 20-year deal to buy U.S. LNG.The aim is to be able to supply customers with LNG from any source - rather than just its own fields - and with a range of pricing models, keeping the company from having to sign long-term contracts at the bottom of the market. ""The best way to protect the value of these projects, in fact, is to not be at the mercy of when buyers are able to sign up,"" Woodside CEO Peter Coleman said this week.SPOT PRICES SLUMP The vulnerability of producers is reflected in a near 50 percent price fall for Asian spot cargoes in recent months to three-and-a-half year lows, which has taken spot LNG well below long-term oil-linked contracts and surprised many industry players.""It doesn't look to be so rosy in the near term as they originally thought,"" said a Singapore-based LNG trader, referring to large Australian export projects.""(But) over the longer term, selling those volumes on the spot market may still end up being a sensible move,"" he said.Others, however, expect spot prices to trend even lower or at least remain bogged down as new U.S. and Australian LNG supplies hit the market from next year.""Producers think they can actually buy their own LNG, resell it on the spot market and make money. I think that's a very naive way of thinking,"" said Vivek Chandra, chief executive at U.S.-based Texas LNG, which aims to begin exports of 2 million tonnes a year to Asia in 2018.The reluctance of buyers to enter into long-term contracts may also have implications for projects still on the drawing board in Australia, where another $180 billion of new or expanded LNG projects from 2018 onwards is being considered.""Going ahead, we don't see any planned Australian projects or expansions based on our analysis. Nothing. Not one,"" said Noelle Leonard, an LNG consultant at FG Energy in Perth.

136,"  (Rewrites throughout to add details from Chevron)Sept 15 Chevron Corp said Monday a blast on a natural gas gathering pipeline into the Henry Hub supply hub in Louisiana on Saturday that killed one worker interrupted ""minimal gas production.""The company said in an email statement that it has rerouted most of the affected production from the blast to an alternative gas system. Chevron said workers were performing routine maintenance on a Chevron Midstream Pipeline gas gathering line in offshore Louisiana waters when the accident occurred. Chevron said a suspected platform valve blowout may have been the cause.Chevron said the unit that operates the line is continuing to depressurize the line offshore to allow a safe repair onshore. The pipeline platform continues to be shut in. The platform is part of the Henry Hub gas gathering system, which runs from offshore Louisiana to onshore, Chevron said.The company said a small amount of gas condensate was released into the water but dissipated. News of the shutdown caused little price reaction over the weekend, but helped cause the front-month October contract to rise about 2 percent to a high of $3.95 per million British thermal units in New York Mercantile Exchange trade earlier Monday. The October front-month was currently up about six cents, or 1.6 percent, to $3.919 at 12:20 p.m. EDT (1620 GMT).Gas traders noted the Gulf of Mexico is not as important to the market as it was a decade ago following the destruction of Gulf Coast infrastructure by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005. In 2004, the federal Gulf of Mexico accounted for about 20 percent of total U.S. gas production.Today, however, only about 3.2 billion cubic feet of gas per day, or 4 percent of U.S. production, comes out of the federal Gulf of Mexico. Much of the gas now comes from shale gas fields like the Marcellus centered in Pennsylvania.

137,"   By Jeb Blount and Marta Nogueira | RIO DE JANEIRO, Sept 16  RIO DE JANEIRO, Sept 16 Brazilian regulators said on Tuesday they were confident that new regulations will trump provisions of the country's 2010 oil law that threaten to strip oil companies such as Royal Dutch Shell Plc of rights to operate major oil fields.""We're pretty sure that the rules will stand up to any legal challenge,"" Thiago Macedo, the lead attorney for oil regulator ANP, said at an industry event. ""Besides, the government has no interest in taking away operator rights to those concessions.""The rules, known as ANP Regulation 25, do not prohibit Brazil from giving operator rights to some existing fields to state-run oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA, the regulators said. Instead it interprets the law to allow operators of existing fields to keep running them when the related oil reserve extends into unsold areas subject to the new law.Under that interpretation, the government would be a minority partner leaving control to existing operators, Macedo said. The rules are Brazil's latest effort to patch up problems caused by the new legislation. Aimed at boosting state control and revenue from big new offshore finds, the law's passage was followed instead by stagnating output, rising costs and falling investor interest in one of the world's most promising oil frontiers.""The new law clearly increases the judicial and political risk for some oil companies operating in Brazil,"" said Pedro Dittrich, a partner specializing in oil at TozziniFreire Advogados, a Rio de Janeiro law firm. Dittrich, who helped draft the 2010 law as a legal advisor, said the ANP regulations resolve some of the uncertainties created by the new law, but only on a case by case basis.The problem starts with the 2010 law's requirement that Petrobras, as Brazil's state-run oil company is known, own at least 30 percent and serve as operator - or lead partner - in all new development in an area known as the Subsalt Polygon. The Polygon, which stretches along Brazil's coast near Rio de Janeiro, was already home to 80 percent of Brazil's output before the law was changed. Much of it was already leased under concession contracts to Petrobras, Shell, Chevron Corp  and other companies. The government promised that the new law would not break those contracts.Brazilian law also requires adjoining exploration areas sharing a common reservoir to be run as a single unit with a single operator, a process known as ""unitization.""With the law requiring Petrobras to operate all future Polygon development, many said that would require Petrobras to take control of any new Polygon area subject to unitization, such as Shell's Gato do Mato prospect in the BM-S-54 Block.Shell owns 80 percent of BM-S-54 and France's Total SA  owns 20 percent. The two companies have paid for all development to date. Shell said talks with the ANP were proceeding in a transparent and constructive environment.   (Reporting by Jeb Blount.

138,"   By Sophie Sassard and Tim Cocks | LONDON/LAGOS  LONDON/LAGOS France's Total SA, Europe's second largest oil company, has put one of its offshore Nigerian oil fields up for sale again, the company said, after a 2012 deal with Sinopec Corp failed.Total has hired BNP Paribas to find buyers for its Usan deepwater oil field located in the Nigeria Oil Prospecting Lease (OML) 138, which could be worth about $2.5 billion, according to sources familiar with the matter.""We have selected an advisor to pursue the sale process of Usan,"" a spokeswoman for Total said.BNP Paribas declined to comment. Usan is not expected to be an easy sale for Total because deepwater exploration requires significant investment and the new owner's returns could be limited if Nigeria rises taxes on foreign investor profits as part of a long expected sector reform called the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB). Before deciding to sell the asset, which is about 100 km off the coast, Total was planning to drill several horizontal deepwater wells and build a deep offshore drilling rig.""Anything in Nigeria is a tough sell,"" said a London-based sector banker. ""And anything with capex is even tougher these days. Very few players would be willing to acquire assets that have big investment commitments attached.""Total said in November 2012 it had sold its 20 percent interest in the field to China's Sinopec for about $2.5 billion in cash. It is not known why the sale failed.The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) is the OML 138 concession holder. Other partners include Chevron, ExxonMobil and Nexen, which is owned by Chinese state company CNOOC Ltd. Total is working on several asset disposals to meet a $10 billion 2015 cash flow generation target. The French group is seeking to raise about $2.5 billion through the sale of its  Super Glu maker Bostik, Reuters reported. ASIAN BUYERS? A deal for the Usan field may have to involve a local company because Nigeria, Africa's top oil producer, is renewing efforts to recoup the benefits from its oil and gas sector.But few Nigerian players would have the money and ability to complete the necessary drilling and building works, several sector bankers said. This means Total's hopes may lie again in the hands of Asian buyers like China's CNOOC, which already has an interest in the USAN field, or India's ONGC and Indian Oil. International oil & gas majors are not expected to show interest because most of them are under pressure from shareholders to cut capital expenditure and improve dividends. Most are seeking to leave Nigeria instead. Earlier this year, ConocoPhillips sold its Nigerian operations to Nigerian oil company Oando for $1.5 billion. Chevron is also in the process of selling assets in Nigeria and Shell recently sold off four oil fields in the West African country.  Taleveras and Transcorp are among the best placed Nigerian potential buyers because they have the strongest financial firepower, said one of the sources. A sector banker said state-backed NNPC could also be interested though it already has a number of commitments with foreign investors, Oando is digesting the ConocoPhillips deal and Seplat is focused on Chevron's assets. ""(Total) needs a couple of local players with deep pockets. The international banks aren't showing as much interest as they were, and the local banks no longer have capacity to raise that kind of debt,"" said a local industry source. Commodity traders and miners such as Glencore or Mercuria could also be interested, in theory, as they have been actively hunting for oil & gas assets to diversify from volatile mining operations, said several sector bankers.But trading houses may not have the required expertise to operate deepwater assets, said one of the bankers. Glencore and Mercuria were among the short-listed bidders for Shell's Nigerian energy assets worth about $3 billion, sources previously told Reuters. RBC Capital Markets said in a report this week that Total was likely to miss production and cash flow targets for next year as it grapples with project disruptions. Total will update the market at a mid-year outlook investors day on September 22.

No decision has been made at this time other than to determine the level of interest of potential buyers,"" Chevron spokesman Braden Reddall said on Friday. The Hawaiian facility is among the company's smallest refineries.  The search for a buyer was previously reported by Bloomberg. In 2009, the San Ramon, California-based company weighed closing the refinery and then later considered turning it into a terminal, but eventually decided against both options.  Chevron plans to sell about $10 billion of assets in the next three years, up from about $7 billion in asset sales in the previous three years.

143,"   By Jarrett Renshaw | NEW YORK, Sept 19  NEW YORK, Sept 19 Chevron Corp has hired an investment bank to identify potential buyers of its 54,000 barrel-a-day refinery in Kapolei on the Hawaiian island of Oahu, a company official said.Deutsche Bank AG was retained to sell the plant, according to another person familiar with the sale, who was not authorized to speak on the matter publicly. Deustsche Bank declined to comment.""After much consideration, Chevron's downstream and chemical leadership has decided to engage an investment banking firm to identify potential parties interested in the purchase of our assets in Hawaii. No decision has been made at this time other than to determine the level of interest of potential buyers,"" Chevron spokesman Braden Reddall said on Friday. The Hawaiian facility is among the company's smallest refineries.The search for a buyer was previously reported by Bloomberg. In 2009, the San Ramon, California-based company weighed closing the refinery and then later considered turning it into a terminal, but eventually decided against both options. Chevron plans to sell about $10 billion of assets in the next three years, up from about $7 billion in asset sales in the previous three years.Chevron Chief Executive Officer John Watson told analysts in March most of the new asset sales would involve uncompetitive parts of the company's oil and natural gas exploration and production business.Closing the plant would leave Hawaii with a single 93,500-barrel-a-day refinery that Par Petroleum Corp  bought from Tesoro Corp last year.

144,"  EnLink Midstream (ENLK.N) (ENLC.N) said on Monday it had signed a $235 million deal with Chevron Corp (CVX.N) to buy natural gas pipelines in Southern Louisiana, including those linked to the Henry Hub supply point that sets U.S. futures prices.EnLink plans to acquire about 1,400 miles of pipelines from Beaumont, Texas, to the Mississippi River corridor that carry about 11 billion cubic feet of working natural gas storage capacity in Southern Louisiana.These assets, combined with EnLink's existing Louisiana operations, will allow the company to provide services to Southern Louisiana's growing industrial, refining and petrochemical marketplace, it said in a statement.   In particular, the deal gives EnLink ownership and management of the Henry Hub, the benchmark for natural gas futures contracts on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Henry Hub is connected to 13 major interstate and intrastate natural gas pipeline and storage systems.The Henry Hub, though still important for U.S. gas pricing, has been surpassed as the most active place for trading the physical form of the fuel by hubs in shale-rich Pennsylvania and elsewhere. A decade ago, the federal Gulf of Mexico pumped about 20 percent of all U.S. natural gas, much of which flowed through the Henry Hub. Now it produces just 4 percent of the nation's total.

148,"   By Raushan Nurshayeva | ASTANA  ASTANA Oct 7 Kazakhstan has backed an expansion project to boost output of Tengizchevroil (TCO), the nation's biggest oil producer, despite higher than originally estimated costs, Kazakh Energy Minister Vladimir Shkolnik said on Tuesday.TCO's output is crucial to keep Kazakhstan's oil output roughly unchanged at 81.8 million tonnes this year and next before the giant Kashagan oil project, shut due to gas leaks in its pipelines last October, is restarted in 2016, a senior energy official said last week.TCO, led by U.S. oil major Chevron with a 50-percent stake, is developing the mammoth Tengiz onshore oilfield in Kazakhstan's western Atyrau region.Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev, who has ruled since Soviet days and whose word is final in the nation of 17 million, met Chevron's top management in his capital Astana on Monday. ""The head of state received Chevron's entire board of directors yesterday,"" Shkolnik said in a speech in parliament. ""The expansion project was approved in principle.""""It was originally planned to cost $23 billion, but due to a number of circumstances our partners presented to us a sum which is much bigger - around $40 billion,"" he said. Shkolnik told reporters later the higher costs were due to higher prices charged for services, pipes and various equipment to be used during the expansion phase.""We (Kazakhstan) will fight and check every figure,"" he said. ""The final figure is still being discussed, it may be lower,"" he added. Output from TCO rose to a record 27.1 million tonnes last year from 24.2 million in 2012. Shkolnik said output was expected to hit 38 million tonnes when the expansion project is finished. TCO, which launched the preparatory, early phase of expansion this year, aims to complete it by 2019.Kazakhstan, the second largest former Soviet oil producer after Russia, holds 20 percent in TCO via state oil and gas company KazMunaiGas, U.S. energy giant Exxon Mobil  has 25 percent and Lukarco, controlled by Russia's Lukoil, the remaining 5 percent.Kazakhstan will receive additional revenue of more than $150 billion in dividends, taxes and other payments after the completion of the expansion project until 2033, Shkolnik said.Along with achieving a record output last year, TCO also paid a record total of just under $15 billion to Kazakhstan in 2013, TCO General Director Tim Miller said in January.

150,"   By Jacob Gronholt-Pedersen | SINGAPORE  SINGAPORE Oct 17 Chevron Corp said on Friday it has made a final investment decision (FID) on the first stage of a deepwater natural gas project in Indonesia, but delayed a decision on the second phase of the multi-billion dollar project.The Chevron-operated Indonesia Deepwater Development (IDD) project, which includes the Bangka, Gendalo, Gehem, Gandang and Maha fields off eastern Borneo, is the country's first ultra-deepwater natural gas integrated project.Chevron recently made a final investment decision on the first part of the project - the Bangka field - after receiving all required government approvals, the company said without providing details.A timeline to make a decision on the second stage of the project - development of the Gendalo and Gehem fields - will slip from this year, the company said. ""A final investment decision for the second stage of IDD will not be achieved in 2014,"" a Chevron spokesman said, without saying how long the FID would be delayed.Chevron said it has not received the necessary government approvals for the second stage, and that the delay will impact the contractual and commercial agreements already in place. Talks with the government to get the project back on track are ""still in early phases and it will require additional time and engagements before we are clear about the project schedule,"" the spokesman said.Chevron expects the Gendalo and Gehem fields to produce a maximum of 1.1 billion cubic feet of natural gas and 47,000 barrels of condensate per day, according to the company's website. The delay comes as Indonesia, one of the world's biggest exporters of liquefied natural gas (LNG), is turning to foreign supplies to keep up with rapidly growing domestic gas demand.The Southeast Asian country will begin LNG imports by 2018 and is aiming to curb new exports of the super-cooled gas.Gas from IDD will be shipped via pipeline for liquefaction to Indonesia's existing Bontang LNG plant.

151,"  * Shutdown of joint field brings back old disputes* Kuwait is placing restrictions on Chevron's operations - sources* Disagreements over right to operate delayed energy projectsBy Rania El Gamal and Reem ShamseddineDUBAI/KHOBAR, Saudi Arabia Oct 21 Saudi Arabia's closure of an offshore oilfield it shares with Kuwait has revived speculation of renewed tensions between the two, and put Chevron's role in the shared Neutral Zone in focus.Crude output from their jointly-run offshore Khafji oilfield has been halted temporarily to comply with environmental rules.""Little things lead to big things, it's an accumulation of the past. Each party says a different story,"" said Kamel al-Harami, an independent Kuwaiti analyst.The loss of Khafji's 280,000 barrels per day of Arabian Heavy crude will be felt more in Kuwait, which has far less spare output than its neighbour, the world's top oil exporter. Oil prices rose briefly to over $86 a barrel on Monday on the news.Any differences between the two OPEC allies are watched closely by oil majors getting ready to return to Kuwait after years of fruitless talks and fierce political opposition to foreign firms taking a role in production in the past.Diplomatic and industry sources have told Reuters that Kuwait has been placing restrictions on the Saudi unit of U.S. oil major Chevron which operates another jointly run Neutral Zone field, Wafra, as a result of various disputes.The curbs have affected oil output from the Neutral Zone, which dates back to 1920s treaties to establish regional borders. Output capacity from the Zone has been around 600,000 bpd until last year, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. But industry sources say it has been in decline in recent months even before the Khafji shutdown.A Chevron spokesman said the company complies with the laws and regulations of the countries where it operates, and does not comment on discussions it has with governments about its business operations.The Saudi's 60-year concession with Chevron was first granted to the U.S. Getty Oil Company in 1949. Texaco acquired Getty Oil in 1984, and Chevron took over Texaco in 2001.A senior Kuwaiti official dismissed any political implications and said the Kuwaiti side was informed of the Khafji shutdown.Recently, Kuwait's oil marketers have been challenging their Saudi counterparts in an increasingly competitive battle for market share, selling oil to buyers in Asia at the widest discount to a comparable Saudi grade in 10 years. KUWAIT'S OBJECTIONS The sources say Kuwait was angry because it was not consulted when the Chevron concession to operate Wafra was renewed by Riyadh in 2009 until 2039.But the row goes back even further, to 2007, when a land dispute between Kuwait and Saudi led to a delay in Kuwait's plans to build an oil refinery. Chevron has had a lease on some of the land on Kuwait's side which was earmarked for the new refinery.In recent months, Kuwait has been making it more difficult for Chevron to acquire work permits to operate in the Zone, because of legal misinterpretation of the agreement, the sources said.""Kuwait has been giving Chevron a hard time,"" one diplomatic source said. Chevron is leading a full-field steam injection project in the onshore Wafra field to boost output of heavy oil there by more than 80,000 bpd.Last year, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait shelved a project to develop another venture in the Neutral Zone, the Dorra offshore gas field, after disagreeing over how to share the gas back on land.Kuwait blames Riyadh for ending that project despite its desperate need for gas for power generation.""These issues between the two countries have started several years ago. Relations soured when Saudi stopped the Dorra project from proceeding,"" said another Kuwaiti official.He added there have been also disagreements over the distribution of investments costs with the Saudi side.Dorra has long been a bone of contention between Kuwait and Iran, which also lays claim to part of the field.Kuwait agreed with Riyadh in 2000 to jointly develop the field they desperately need to satisfy their growing gas need.More than a decade on, little progress has been made and it has now been shelved indefinitely.The Neutral Zone is the only place in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait where foreign oil firms have equity in fields, which are otherwise owned and operated by state oil companies. Crude output is divided equally between the two countries.It survived the nationalisation of the Saudi oil industry in the 1970s. Since then, Saudi reserves of 264 billion barrels - around a fifth of the world's proven oil reserves - have been off limits to international oil companies.

152,"   By Fergus Jensen | JAKARTA  JAKARTA Oct 28 The target for full operation of the Indonesia Deepwater Development (IDD) gas project has been delayed by up to two years to around 2020, a senior official said, reducing the country's prospects of remaining a major gas exporter.The delay to the $12 billion ultra-deepwater IDD project comes as Indonesia scales back exports of liquefied natural gas and looks to future imports to help meet rapidly growing domestic demand. State energy firm Pertamina has signed deals to secure imports of LNG from the United States from 2018.Chevron Corp said earlier this month it had made a final investment decision to go ahead with the first stage of the IDD project - the Bangka field - but delayed a decision on the second stage - the Gendalo and Gehem fields - while it reassessed its development plans.The project includes the Bangka, Gendalo, Gehem, Gandang and Maha fields off eastern Borneo. Upstream oil and gas regulator (SKKMigas) is currently working with Chevron to review new reserves estimates and development plans for the Gendalo and Gehem fields, SKKMigas Chairman Johannes Widjonarko told reporters. ""Clearly the reserves will change.""The adjustments could delay the project by ""up to two years, if permits are processed quickly"", Widjonarko said, from an earlier target to start production in 2018.Wells are currently being drilled at the Bangka field, which is scheduled to start producing in 2016, Widjonarko said. Newly inaugurated Energy Minister Sudirman Said warned on Monday that Indonesia could enter a period of crisis unless energy issues were addressed seriously.The performance of Indonesia's new administration will be judged on how quickly it can make decisions on large oil and gas projects including IDD, said Pri Agung Rakhmanto, a member of a team that advised President Joko Widodo on energy matters prior to his inauguration. ""These need immediate decisions,"" Rakhmanto said, referring to delays at IDD as well as the Masela Abadi project operated by Inpex and the Jangkrik field operated by Eni.Chevron expects to produce a maximum of 1.1 billion cubic feet of natural gas and 47,000 barrels of condensate per day from the two fields in the second stage of IDD.The Gendalo and Gehem field developments will involve two separate production hubs, each with its own floating production unit, subsea drill centres, gas and condensate pipelines, and onshore receiving facility.Gas from IDD will be shipped via pipeline to Indonesia's existing Bontang LNG plant for liquefaction.

153,"  (Corrects story published on Oct 28 to say that Chevron's Rosebank project has been delayed, not called off, paragraph 29)* Over 1 bln barrels could stay in the ground* Arctic Norway, mature British fields most vulnerable* British, Norwegian oil investments set for sharp falls* Ongoing UK projects, Sverdrup to go onBy Balazs Koranyi and Gwladys FoucheOSLO, Oct 28 Big oil and gas finds in waters along Europe's northern edge may remain undeveloped now that oil prices have dropped, keeping potential supply of over a billion barrels of oil equivalent out of the market for the foreseeable future.Discoveries in Arctic Norway could stay dormant, while mature British fields could face early closure and frontier exploration in areas such as Greenland could be called off as oil companies cut capital spending by up to a fifth.Projects such as Statoil's $15.5 billion Johan Castberg in the Barents Sea and smaller finds by Shell, OMV  and others were once expected to open new oil provinces.They now face delays, cancellations or a radical redesign as oil prices at $85 per barrel make them unprofitable.Norway, Western Europe's biggest oil and gas producer, is among the most vulnerable because of its already high costs and its recent push into Arctic waters, not far from the edge of the winter sea ice, where costs are among the highest in the sector.""We are looking at each project and the project that is most economically viable,"" Runi Hansen, Statoil's Arctic chief said. ""If the Arctic projects are not commercially viable, we are not going for it.""If oil prices are significantly lower over the next two years, ""we believe that about 1 billion barrels of oil and gas resources from the Norwegian continental shelf are now at risk of sanction delays,"" said Espen Erlingsen, an analyst at Oslo-based oil consultancy Rystad Energy.""This could reduce (Norway's) oil supply potential by about 400 thousand barrels per day in 2025 if oil prices stayed at a level of $80 per barrel,"" he added. Norway produced 1.46 million bpd of oil in 2013.Statoil's Johan Castberg, Norway's biggest Arctic find with up to 600 million barrels of oil, has already been delayed by more than a year. Production from the field would break even at about $80 to $85 per barrel, Nordea Markets estimated, due to its remote location and need for extensive infrastructure.A recent tax hike has made the project even more expensive, but the government has ruled out mitigating measures.""I'm not a politician who believes that political decisions make something profitable,"" Oil and Energy Minister Tord Lien said. ""The main responsibility has to remain with the industry. We didn't create the high costs.""Expensive projects in harsh British waters West of Shetland, with planned investment of over 15 billion pounds ($24 billion) in coming years, are likely to continue because many are already too far advanced for oil majors to pull the plug.If low oil prices persist, however, they will erode margins and extend companies' financial pain.Goldman Sachs estimates that Europe's integrated oil companies require an oil price of $122 per barrel to be free-cash-flow neutral in 2015 given their current capital spending budgets. To achieve a 4.5 percent free cash-flow yield by 2018, capital spending would need to fall by 13 percent at an oil price of $90 per barrel and by 20 percent if oil falls to $80.ARCTIC RISK In the Barents Sea, a casualty may be OMV's Arctic Wisting discovery with 150 million barrels of oil equivalent, which could need $110 per barrel to break even, according to Rystad Energy.OMV has said it needs to find more resource around the field and does not expect an investment decision before 2017 or 2018.Lundin's Alta and Gohta fields also may need close to $80 just to break even, the Rystad consultancy estimated.""The biggest worry is the Barents Sea,"" said Thina Margrethe Saltvedt, an oil analyst at Nordea Markets. ""You can't start one of the projects alone."" ""This is a high-cost area, and they have to do a lot of investment in the infrastructure,"" she said.South of the Arctic circle in the Norwegian Sea, a big project at risk is Statoil's $4.5 billion investment to extend the life of the Snorre field by adding a new platform. The project was already in doubt when oil prices were at $100, and any delay would further erode its viability as the pressure in the field drops.A decision on the project, planned for early next year, has been delayed to the fourth quarter of 2016.Smaller projects also in the Norwegian Sea such as Shell's Linnorm in the Norwegian Sea and RWE's Zidane, which have already been delayed, could stay on ice indefinitely, analysts say.The only investment that will go ahead without a doubt is Statoil's $18 billion Johan Sverdrup in the North Sea, where costs are estimated at less than $40 a barrel. The field could hold up to 2.9 billion barrels of oil equivalent and produce up to 650,000 barrels per day after its start-up in 2019.MATURE UK On the British side of the North Sea, mature fields are even more at risk as their fixed costs rise due to the need for increasing maintenance work at older platforms, while revenues are declining due to lower output and falling oil prices.""The recent fall in the oil price ... makes it much harder to attract new investment into the basin or to sustain much of the mature infrastructure,"" said Mike Tholen, the economics director industry trade body Oil & Gas UK.Tholen said the government needed to do its part in reducing taxes to improve the region's competitiveness.Chevron's costly future development Rosebank has been delayed for several years, and its partners say another delay is possible. Statoil's Bressay has already been called off. But developments of newly discovered fields that are too far along to be stopped will simply go ahead with lower yields.In British waters, oil investments peaked at 14.4 billion pounds in 2013 and were expected to be half that much by 2016, even before the recent oil price plunge. Norwegian oil investments, seen hitting a record $34 billion this year, could fall 15 percent next year.""Oil majors started to realise that their business model doesn't work unless the oil price continues to rise,"" Torbjoern Kjus, an oil analyst DNB bank, said.

The company gave no reason for the output decline in the first nine months of this year. Senior Kazakh energy officials said last month that TCO was undergoing planned repair and maintenance work which was due to end this month. TCO's output is crucial for keeping Kazakhstan's oil production at 81.8 million tonnes this year and next. Output at the huge Kashagan oilfield in the Caspian Sea, which was halted due to gas leaks shortly after its launch in September 2013, is unlikely to restart before the second half of 2016. Last month Kazakhstan gave the go-ahead to an expansion project to boost TCO's output to 38 million tonnes by 2019.Chevron holds 50 percent of TCO, while Exxon Mobil  owns 25 percent, Kazakh state oil company KazMunaiGas  20 percent and Lukarco, controlled by Russia's Lukoil, the remaining 5 percent.

The Malaysian state-owned energy company is expected to make a final investment decision on its LNG project before year end. The Prince Rupert Gas Transmission pipeline, which is being developed by TransCanada Corp, will only go ahead if Petronas' LNG project is approved.More than a dozen LNG terminals have been proposed for the Pacific coast province as energy companies from around the world race to export cheap Canadian gas to international markets. But uncertainties around taxation, the regulatory process and aboriginal consent have called into question whether any of the projects will ultimately be realized.Under the benefit deal, British Columbia will pay the Nisga'a C$1 million at signing, C$2.5 million when construction begins and another C$2.5 million when gas starts to flow. The Nisga'a will also receive a yet-to-be determined share of the C$10 million a year in ongoing benefits that will be available to all aboriginal communities along the pipeline's 900-kilometer (560 mile) route.The province has previously reached similar deals with 15 of the 16 aboriginal communities on the route of a separate natural gas pipeline that would serve an LNG project being developed by Chevron Corp.(1 US dollar = 1.1304 Canadian dollar)   (Reporting by Julie Gordon; Editing by Richard Pullin)",2014-11-21,CVX,"Fri Nov 21, 2014 | 12:31pm EST",CORRECTED-Canadian aboriginal group signs deal to support LNG pipeline,http://www.reuters.com//article/canada-lng-aborginal-idUSL2N0TA2HZ20141121?type=companyNews

Mexico is implementing a sweeping energy sector reform approved earlier this year that ended the decades-long monopoly of state-owned oil company Pemex.Moshiri said the company will soon purchase geological data in order to better evaluate which fields in Mexico it will seek to bid on when the first blocks are tendered next year.""We are going to go through the data evaluation and look at it and see how (opportunities in Mexico) compare with other opportunities globally,"" he said without saying what fiscal terms would make Mexican projects competitive. Moshiri declined to specify which areas are of most interest to the company, either for possible tie-ups with Pemex or for development rights to the 169 fields that will be put up for grabs next year as part of the Round One tender.He said that Chevron, the third-largest deep water crude producer in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico at about 143,000 barrels per day (bpd), is not ruling out any would-be projects in Mexico.Moshiri said there are ""tremendous synergies"" to develop supply chains and share infrastructure both in Mexican deep water projects as well as onshore.

174,"  * Initial bet was $7 mln, company now worth $246 mln* First gas production started this week* Project benefiting from China's switch from coal to gasBy Sonali PaulMELBOURNE, Dec 5 An Australian entrepreneur's bet on natural gas acreage in a Chinese desert cast off by Chevron Corp is set to reap far bigger returns than expected, a director of the firm behind the project said.In what appears a rare bright spot for gas investments, as global energy prices slump, the project is benefiting from Beijing's policies to boost output of the cleaner-burning fuel.Chevron gave up a 50 percent stake in 3,000 square km in China's Ordos Basin to Australian Bernard Ridgeway in 2005, in return for spending $7 million to drill and assess the resource. ""It was in a very undeveloped state at that time, so it was a fairly big punt,"" said Gavin Harper, a non-executive director recruited by Ridgeway for the firm he founded, Sino Gas & Energy .Nine years later, after snaring the rest of Chevron's interest for free and then selling a 51 percent stake to Hong Kong-based MIE Holdings Corp for $100 million, Sino Gas started producing this week.The acreage is in an area known for reserves of tight gas, which needs horizontal drilling and fracturing technology to free gas trapped in rock. Sino's pilot production, targeted to reach 25 million cubic feet a day, marks the first step toward certifying reserves. It then needs a final development plan approved before it can move to full production, expected in 2017.The blocks it owns with MIE and state-owned partners potentially could hold 4 trillion cubic feet of gas, equivalent to Japan's annual demand and much bigger than first thought. SWITCH TO GAS Besides scale, it is benefiting from China's push to use gas instead of coal to cut pollution and emissions, which has led to two gas price rises since the project was conceived.Sino Gas has agreed a selling price of $9.50 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf) to a customer in Shanxi, more than four times its production cost of $2 per Mcf, Sino Gas Chief Executive Glenn Corrie told Reuters.Analysts say the firm's key challenges are to secure approvals on its reserve assessments and development plan from the government and its production sharing partners China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) and CUCBM, a state-owned company led by CNOOC Ltd, within the next two years.Noting how it should be shielded from plunging oil prices, Euroz analyst Michael Skinner has a Sino Gas target price of A$0.42. The stock last traded at A$0.19, valuing the company at A$293 million ($246 million).

175,"  WELLINGTON Dec 9 New Zealand awarded 15 oil and gas exploration licences on Tuesday, with U.S. giant Chevron and India's ONGC Videsh joining the hunt in the South Pacific country for the first time.Chevron is partnering with Norway's Statoil  to explore three prospects off the lightly explored south-east coast of the North Island.Statoil is already in New Zealand and has been awarded a further offshore block in its own right at the top northwest coast of the North Island.The Indian government controlled ONGC Videsh Ltd  has made its first foray into New Zealand with one offshore exploration permit in the Taranaki Basin, in the same region as several commercially successful oil and gas fields.""New players continue to enter our market, and existing players cement and expand their work here,"" Energy Minister Simon Bridges said in a statement. The government has changed the rules for the tendering and awarding of exploration permits to encourage foreign companies to explore the southern oceans around the country.The awarding of the permits, which are open for between 10 and 15 years, comes at a time when major oil companies such as BP, Shell, Exxon Mobil, and Total  are cutting back on exploration, laying off staff and selling assets globally to cope with sliding oil prices. The permit recipients have committed to various work programmes ranging from geological and seismic surveys through to drilling exploration wells.Six of the permits awarded were for onshore blocks, including two on the west coast of the South Island, while nine were for offshore blocks. Of the total, seven permits were for exploration in the Taranaki region. Other isolated finds have been made in the east of the North Island and the top of the South Island, but have not proved to be economic.Austrian oil major OMV, which already has interests in commercial fields in New Zealand, has extended its involvement with two offshore permits.Other permits were awarded to established explorer and producer Canada's TAG Oil, a joint venture of local Todd Exploration and Australia's Beach Petroleum, New Zealand-owned Petrochem Ltd and British-owned Mosman Oil and Gas Ltd.A small New Zealand-based private company New Endeavour Resources Ltd, which wants to attract other investors, has entered the sector for the first time with an offshore permit.

176,"  KIEV Dec 15 U.S. energy major Chevron  plans to withdraw from a $10 billion shale gas deal with Kiev, a senior Ukrainian presidential official said on Monday.Ukraine signed a shale gas production-sharing agreement with Chevron amid great fanfare in November 2013, just months before mass protests in Kiev ousted former president Viktor Yanukovich, plunging the country into a major crisis with Russia.""There is information that they (Chevron) are planning this decision,"" Valeriy Chaliy told journalists, referring to a report by local media that Chevron had told the government it was pulling out of the deal.Chaliy declined to give further details. Local media said a move by the first post-Yanukovich government to increase taxes for energy companies lay at the root of Chevron's decision.Chevron in Kiev refused to comment on the report. A London-based spokesperson for Chevron said: ""We have just delivered to the Ukrainian government our response. Therefore it is premature for us to comment."" The agreement had been designed to unfold slowly over 50 years, with an initial investment by Chevron in the first two or three years of $350 million for exploration work.The deal to develop the Olesska field in western Ukraine followed a similar shale gas agreement with Royal Dutch Shell  -- both keystone projects for Ukraine's bid to lessen its energy dependence on Russia with whom it is embroiled in a dispute over gas prices and unpaid debts. The Shell deal could also be under threat as the gas deposit intended for development is close to the eastern territories now controlled by pro-Russian separatists.Earlier this year, Chevron said the firm was still interested in the Ukrainian shale gas project, but since then the situation in eastern Ukraine has deteriorated, claiming more than 4,700 lives.(Reporting By Pavel Polityuk; Editing by Alessandra Prentice and Richard Balmforth)",2014-12-15,CVX,"Mon Dec 15, 2014 | 9:01am EST",Ukraine says Chevron plans to pull out of $10 bln shale gas deal,http://www.reuters.com//article/ukraine-crisis-gas-idUSL6N0TZ29A20141215?type=companyNews

182,"  * Brent, U.S. crude fall over $2 a barrel after Wednesday rally* Pressure to find new bottom still strong, traders say   (Updates throughout to close)By Barani KrishnanNEW YORK, Dec 18 Global crude oil prices slumped anew on Thursday, a day after a short-covering rally, as traders placed fresh bets the market would resume a six-month rout on worries about a supply glut.Benchmark Brent and U.S. crude tumbled $2 a barrel each in late trading after initially extending Wednesday's short-covering, which lifted oil prices by more than $3.With Brent back below the psychologically-key level of $60 a barrel and U.S. crude under $55, traders braced for more selling in a market that has lost about half its value since June.""We're continuing to search for a bottom and might even see another significant drop before the year-end,"" said Gene McGillian, an analyst at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut. While the market seemed to slide on renewed worries about oversupply, traders said some of the selling could have been due to position squaring ahead of Friday's expiry of the January front-month contract in U.S. crude.Some cited a Bloomberg report about a Nigerian port workers union suspending a strike, although workers in that dock union were only involved in container shipping in Lagos, not oil ports.The slump set in at midmorning and accelerated in the last 30 minutes of trade. ""Liquidity (was) at its highest at the open and close; lots of systems use (the) market on close orders to enter (and) exit,"" said Chandravir Ahuja at Kolmar Americas in Bridgeport, Connecticut.Brent's front-month contract closed down $1.91 at $59.27 a barrel, after hitting a session low at $59.17.A broker suggested that Brent needed to rally and hold well above $61 a barrel ""to have any decent strength technically."" In Wednesday's short-covering rally, Brent hit $64.40 before closing at $61.18. U.S. crude's front-month contract settled down $2.36 at $54.11, having fallen to $54.05 earlier. It rose to $58.98 the previous day.Oil's near 50 percent drop over the past six-months began on worries about fast-growing U.S. shale oil supplies and accelerated after OPEC's decision in November not to cut output.Oil companies have, meanwhile, announced cuts in exploration and capital spending.Chevron Corp has put on indefinite hold a plan to drill for oil in the Beaufort Sea in Canada's Arctic while Marathon Oil cut its capital expenditure for next year by about 20 percent.Canadian oil producers also deepened cuts in 2015 spending, as Husky Energy, MEG Energy and Penn West Petroleum joined those scaling back capital budgets.

Chevron holds 50 percent of the venture.However, she added that overall plans for oil production in the country would not be changed. Output at Chevron-led CVX.N Tengizchevroil (TCO), Kazakhstan's largest oil producer, fell by 1.5 percent year on year in the January-September period to 19.8 million tonnes (158 million barrels.TCO, which develops the Tengiz onshore oilfield in western Kazakhstan, also involves Exxon Mobil, which owns 25 percent, Kazakh state oil company KazMunaiGas with 20 percent and Lukarco, owned by Russia's Lukoil, which has the remaining 5 percent. Abylkasymova did no give reasons behind the production decline. Senior Kazakh energy officials have said that TCO was carrying out planned repair and maintenance work. The second-largest ex-Soviet oil producer after Russia raised its oil output to 81.7 million tonnes last year from 79.2 million tonnes in 2012.Plans to substantially increase oil production in Kazakhstan were undermined by a stoppage at the huge Kashagan oilfield in the Caspian Sea.

One component, Chevron Corp, the No. 2 U.S. energy company, had a 1 in the Analyst Revision Score, meaning analysts have been more furiously lowering estimates for Chevron than for 99 percent of companies.  EPS estimates for Chevron's fourth quarter have dropped dramatically in the last month. Six different analysts have lowered earnings expectations by an average of 14.3 percent in that time, during which the stock price has actually risen by about 1 percent. Six of the largest 10 energy companies, accounting for 33 percent of the sector's market capitalization, have a ranking of 9 or less in StarMine's Analyst Revision Score.The outlook has continued to worsen as crude futures prices kept sliding to new 5-1/2 year lows. U.S. crude oil recently fell below $50 a barrel after trading above $100 for the most part between February and July of last year. [O/R] ""We believe it is more likely that oil goes to $20 before it goes to $80, and we think that oil prices are likely to remain low for a long time,"" Brian Reynolds, chief market strategist at Rosenblatt Securities in New York, wrote on Tuesday.Marathon Oil, Hollyfrontier and QEP Resources are among the other handful of energy companies with a 1 Analyst Revision Score. On Tuesday, Bank of America/Merrill Lynch cut its rating on Chesapeake Energy and Laredo Petroleum to ""underperform"" and EOG Resources, the seventh-largest energy company on the S&P 1500, was downgraded to neutral.Expected earnings growth for the S&P 500 energy sector's in the fourth quarter was at -19.8 percent, according to Thomson Reuters IBES data, down from a 6.4 percent growth expectation on October 1.

188,"   By Rodrigo Campos | NEW YORK  NEW YORK As if plummeting oil prices were not giving energy companies enough to worry about in 2015, Wall Street has turned against the sector, with stock analysts slashing earnings estimates.Despite a 23 percent drop in the S&P 1500 energy sector .SPCOME since the end of June 2014, stock prices still may not account for the drastically lowered forecasts for the sector's earnings, particularly if oil prices continue to slide.Of the 10 S&P 1500 .SPSUP sectors, Thomson Reuters StarMine data ranks energy as having the worst analyst sentiment, using a model that lists equities by aggregating metrics that include changes in estimates for company earnings-per-share and revenue.On Tuesday, energy was dead last, with its components averaging a ranking of 14 out of 100, down sharply from 26 a day earlier. One component, Chevron Corp (CVX.N), the No. 2 U.S. energy company, had a 1 in the Analyst Revision Score, meaning analysts have been more furiously lowering estimates for Chevron than for 99 percent of companies.  EPS estimates for Chevron's fourth quarter have dropped dramatically in the last month. Six different analysts have lowered earnings expectations by an average of 14.3 percent in that time, during which the stock price has actually risen by about 1 percent. Six of the largest 10 energy companies, accounting for 33 percent of the sector's market capitalization, have a ranking of 9 or less in StarMine's Analyst Revision Score.The outlook has continued to worsen as crude futures prices kept sliding to new 5-1/2 year lows. U.S. crude oil recently fell below $50 a barrel after trading above $100 for the most part between February and July of last year. [O/R] ""We believe it is more likely that oil goes to $20 before it goes to $80, and we think that oil prices are likely to remain low for a long time,"" Brian Reynolds, chief market strategist at Rosenblatt Securities in New York, wrote on Tuesday.Marathon Oil (MRO.N), Hollyfrontier (HFC.N) and QEP Resources (QEP.N) are among the other handful of energy companies with a 1 Analyst Revision Score. On Tuesday, Bank of America/Merrill Lynch cut its rating on Chesapeake Energy (CHK.N) and Laredo Petroleum (LPI.N) to ""underperform"" and EOG Resources (EOG.N), the seventh-largest energy company on the S&P 1500, was downgraded to neutral.Expected earnings growth for the S&P 500 energy sector's .SPNY in the fourth quarter was at -19.8 percent, according to Thomson Reuters IBES data, down from a 6.4 percent growth expectation on October 1. The first quarter looks even worse - an expected decline of 32.2 percent.

189,"  (Refiling to delete extraneous letter in the first paragraph)By Gayatri Suroyo and Eveline DanubrataJAKARTA Jan 16 Indonesia has scrapped a land tax that companies pay while exploring for oil and gas, a move that might encourage exploration at a time of concern that it could fall sharply due to tumbling oil prices.According to a ministerial decree posted on the Finance Ministry's website, the tax office is no longer assessing a 0.5 percent ""land and building tax"" charged on the area in which companies are carrying out exploration activities, effective from Jan. 1.Wahju Tumakaka, spokesman for the ministry's tax office, said the interpretation used for taxing exploration areas was wrong, thus the ministry amended the regulation.The tax ""is supposed to be applied for those using Indonesian land. In terms of the oil and gas sector, it should only be applied during production stage,"" Tumakaka told Reuters. He said that in 2014, the land and building tax from oil and gas exploration and production work brought in about 18 trillion rupiah ($1.43 billion), or 1.2 percent of total government revenue.  No breakdown of what percentage came from just oil exploration was available.In December, the Indonesian Petroleum Association said that spending on oil and gas exploration and production in the country could fall by up to 20 percent this year. FORMER OPEC MEMBER Indonesia, a former OPEC member, was self-sufficient in oil for decades, but is now a net importer. Output in the Southeast Asian nation has declined since a 1995 peak, and is projected to fall to 700,000 barrels a day (bpd) in 2019 from an estimated 849,000 bpd this year.To attract more investment, the energy ministry has been asking for tax incentives for exploration for several years.An analyst who follows the oil industry said the tax change is ""quite important"" and could encourage companies to invest more in exploration.Among oil companies, the tax was ""their number one gripe, it's the first thing they wanted to change,"" he said, adding that it was positive that the government is listening to the industry and being ""more investor friendly"".Oil and gas companies operating in Indonesia include Chevron Corp, Exxon Mobil Corp, ConocoPhillips, and state-owned Pertamina.

With oil prices down by half since June and profits slipping, bankers are readying for a wave of mergers and acquisitions that can be made on the cheap.""Have you considered selling Oxy?""

""I looked at Chevron and they don't have any free cash,"" Chazen said on the call. Laughter was audible in the background, but eyebrows were raised by the mention of a specific company, which is three times Oxy's size with $14.3 billion cash in the bank and could probably buy Oxy if it wanted.After Chazen's comments, shares of Occidental, which had been falling, reversed course.

198,"   By Ernest Scheyder | WILLISTON, N.D.  WILLISTON, N.D. Chevron Corp (CVX.N), the second-largest U.S. oil producer, reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit on Friday as sales of chemicals, lubricants and other refined products helped offset plunging crude prices CLc1.That drop in crude prices, about 60 percent since June, has eroded margins across the oil industry and forced scores of companies to slash spending budgets. Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L), a so-called international oil company like Chevron, said on Thursday it would cut its spending over the next three years by $15 billion.Taking similar steps, Chevron executives slashed the company's 2015 capital budget by 13 percent to $35 billion.   ""We enter 2015 with the financial strength to meet the challenges of a volatile crude price environment and with significant efforts under way to manage to a lower cost structure,"" Chief Executive Officer John Watson said in a statement. Indeed, the strength of the company's downstream operation, which sells those refined products, proved to be the main bright spot for Chevron this quarter, with profit in the division spiking nearly fourfold.Earnings in Chevron's upstream unit, which finds and produces oil and gas, dropped 45 percent.          In total, Chevron posted fourth-quarter net income of $3.47 billion, or $1.85 per share, compared with $4.93 billion, or $2.57 per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected earnings of $1.63 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Foreign currency conversion charges dented earnings by $432 million, Chevron said. Production between the quarters held steady at 2.58 million barrels of oil equivalent per day.    Shares of the San Ramon, California-based company fell about 1 percent to $102 in premarket trading on Friday.

Chevron Corp (CVX.N) halted its 2015 share repurchase program on Friday, a move designed to conserve cash amid tumbling oil prices and its latest cost-cutting step after slashing capital spending.The buyback decision took Wall Street by surprise, with shares of the No. 2 U.S. oil producer falling as much as 4 percent after the announcement on a conference call with investors. Chevron repurchased $5 billion worth of shares in 2014, helping its float shrink nearly 2 percent from 2013 levels.In announcing the buyback curtailment on the call, Chief Financial Officer Pat Yarrington cited ""the change in market conditions,"" a reference to the roughly 60 percent drop in crude oil prices since last June.Earlier Friday, Chevron said it would cut 2015 capital expenditures by 13 percent. The move echoed similar steps earlier this week by Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L), Hess Corp (HES.N), ConocoPhillips (COP.N) and others to conserve cash in an environment where the crude price drop shows little sign of abating.Amid the cutbacks, Chief Executive Officer John Watson stressed that Chevron's dividend, currently $1.07 per quarter, remained the ""highest priority"" for the company's balance sheet. Many investors have long been drawn to Chevron for its high dividend.Comparing buybacks to a ""flywheel,"" a rotational device that can store or disperse energy as needed, Watson said future repurchases were possible. ""If we get to a circumstance where we are generating cash flow and we don't see other opportunities, we've got no reticence at all to repurchase shares if we think that is a better opportunity for us,"" he said.CAUTION IN LNG MARKET The buyback freeze and capex cut are part of Chevron's efforts to curb spending, with ""significant cost-reduction efforts underway,"" Watson said. He added that layoffs are possible. If oil prices do not recover, ""you will see lower spending, absolutely,"" he said.As part of that approach, Chevron is ""significantly pacing"" its spending on the Kitimat liquefied natural gas (LNG) project in Canada. Apache Corp (APA.N) last year sold its stake to Woodside Petroleum Ltd (WPL.AX).Chevron has not determined whether to fully commit to Kitimat, a decision that doesn't appear coming anytime soon, Watson said.         ""I think people are pretty cautious right now in the LNG market,"" Watson said.Chevron expects the long-delayed Gorgon LNG project in Australia to record its first sales this year, and that its Wheatstone LNG project, also in Australia, should start up by late 2016. Even with the uncertainty in energy markets, getting Gorgon online is the company's highest priority this year, Watson said. Chevron said 2015 output would rise at most by 3 percent from 2014 production of 2.57 million barrels of oil equivalent per day.

Jan 30 Chevron Corp, the second-largest U.S. oil producer, reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit on Friday as sales of chemicals, lubricants and other refined products helped offset plunging crude prices.That drop in crude prices, about 60 percent since June, has eroded margins across the oil industry and forced scores of companies to slash spending budgets. Royal Dutch Shell, a so-called international oil company like Chevron, said on Thursday it would cut its spending over the next three years by $15 billion.Taking similar steps, Chevron executives slashed the company's 2015 capital budget by 13 percent to $35 billion. ""We enter 2015 with the financial strength to meet the challenges of a volatile crude price environment and with significant efforts under way to manage to a lower cost structure,"" Chief Executive Officer John Watson said in a statement.Indeed, the strength of the company's downstream operation, which sells those refined products, proved to be the main bright spot for Chevron this quarter, with profit in the division spiking nearly fourfold. Earnings in Chevron's upstream unit, which finds and produces oil and gas, dropped 45 percent.In total, Chevron posted fourth-quarter net income of $3.47 billion, or $1.85 per share, compared with $4.93 billion, or $2.57 per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected earnings of $1.63 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Foreign currency conversion charges dented earnings by $432 million, Chevron said.Production between the quarters held steady at 2.58 million barrels of oil equivalent per day.Shares of the San Ramon, California-based company fell about 1 percent to $102 in premarket trading on Friday.

""The strength in the consumer spending silo of this data is actually longer term very encouraging because we know it is likely to be sustainable,"" Kenny said.That strength appeared to be reflected in some corporate results. Amazon shares jumped 12.8 percent in premarket trading a day after posting earnings that beat Wall Street expectations on strong sales during the holiday season.S&P 500 e-mini futures were down 19 points and fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract, indicated a lower open. Dow Jones industrial average e-mini futures rose 174 points and Nasdaq 100 e-mini futures lost 14 points.

They, and other energy firms, were originally attracted by estimates of massive shale gas reserves in Poland.But since they launched exploration, the estimates have been downgraded, geological conditions for drilling have proved difficult, and industry executives complain of uncertainty about government regulation. In the past few months, the sharp fall in world energy prices has forced energy majors to make cuts in spending and pull the plug on faltering investment projects.Shale gas is under a cloud too in Romania, where Chevron is also active. Prime Minister Victor Ponta said in November last year it seemed likely Romania has no shale gas, despite the efforts to find it. Governments in eastern Europe, especially Poland, Romania and Lithuania, embraced shale gas enthusiastically because they saw it as a way of reducing their reliance on imported energy from Russia.They view those imports as a source of vulnerability because they have tense relations with the Kremlin, and their supplies have been disrupted in the past.However, eastern Europe is already diversifying supplies by other means, mainly through importing liquefied natural gas from supplies such as Qatar, and by building better connections with western Europe's gas pipeline network.

In fact, revisions to estimates of technically recoverable resources, disappointing outcomes and growing opposition to shale gas have reduced the hype about development prospects in Europe.The surge in U.S. shale oil and gas production has also caused a large build in global supplies at a time of low demand, contributing to a sharp fall in crude oil prices since June last year.""I don't know any serious person who thinks Europe is going to have a shale gas revolution in 15 years at least.

Feb 20 Chevron Corp, the second-largest U.S.-based oil producer, said on Friday its oil and natural gas reserves fell 1 percent last year largely due to the sale of its stake in a Chad oil field.The company had proved reserves of 11.1 billion barrels of oil equivalent on Dec. 31, about 1 percent lower than a year earlier.Even as Chevron has five major projects coming online by the end of the decade, dwindling reserves have become a key concern for international energy companies, many of which have massive capital budgets to find and extract oil and natural gas. San Ramon, California-based Chevron is also grappling with plunging crude oil prices , which Chief Executive John Watson said last month would lead to ""significant cost reductions.""Other companies, too, such as Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch Shell, have aggressively tried to balance cheap oil with the crucial need to find and develop new reserves that are increasingly found in remote places such as Papua New Guinea and the Arctic Circle.At the end of 2014, about 20 percent of Chevron's reserves were in Kazakhstan and 19 percent in the United States, the largest single areas of holdings, Chevron said. Last year, Chevron sold its stake in an oil concession and pipeline system in Chad's Doba Basin to the country's government for $1.3 billion.The exit from the project, led by Exxon, was largely seen as a way to refocus cash toward Chevron's Permian shale holdings in Texas, considered one of the largest shale oil reserves in the world. While Chevron has invested billions of dollars in global energy projects in recent years, investors have grown anxious as smaller independent rivals, including Whiting Petroleum  and Continental Resources, have successfully developed U.S. shale plays.More than half of Chevron's 1.5 million Permian acres don't require royalty payouts to landowners, an advantage over rivals. Chevron is trying to lift Permian production to 250,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day by 2020.Proved reserves refers to oil and natural gas reserves that can be successfully recovered using existing technology. It differs from unproven reserves, a metric that describes an oil or gas field's potential, which may be limited by geology, politics and other factors.Shares of Chevron fell 0.5 percent in afternoon trading Friday to $107.85.

Instead, it will concentrate on boosting the profitability of its existing 255,000-bpd Athabasca oil sands project.""The Pierre River Mine remains a very long-term opportunity for us, but it's not currently a priority,"" Lorraine Mitchelmore, president of Shell's Canadian unit, said in a statement. ""Our current focus is on making our heavy oil business as economically and environmentally competitive as possible."" Mitchelmore said Shell would hold the leases on the mine and could reapply in the future.Shell has regulatory approval to expand its Jackpine oil sands mine in northern Alberta by 100,000 bpd.

223,"   By Mike Stone and Ernest Scheyder | NEW YORK/WILLISTON, N.D., March 13  NEW YORK/WILLISTON, N.D., March 13 Whiting Petroleum Corp, North Dakota's largest oil producer, has put Texas acreage and pipeline assets up for sale as an alternative to a sale of the full company, according to sources familiar with the matter.This strategy could appease investors outraged by the possibility of any outright sale. It would dispose of assets not central to the core shale operations and generate cash for the company's balance sheet, engulfed by more than $3 billion in debt after December's buyout of smaller rival Kodiak Oil & Gas.JPMorgan has shopped the full company in recent days to select parties, several people said. However, several potential acquirers' interest in buying all of Whiting was tepid due to concerns about Whiting's $5.63 billion debt load, the sources said.One of the people said a bid deadline has been scheduled for next week.Representatives for Whiting and JPMorgan declined to comment. The people were granted anonymity to speak freely about the process, but they were not authorized to speak on the record.ANGER OVER SALE TALK AFTER STOCK FALL While the Kodiak buyout did stress financial metrics at Denver-based Whiting, it gave the company unparalleled growth opportunities in the No. 2 U.S. oil-producing state for an exceptionally cheap price.Whiting acquired Kodiak's proven reserves of roughly 167 million barrels of oil equivalent for $23.77 per barrel, far below the current benchmark price for American crude oil, roughly $47 per barrel. Given that cost advantage, some on Wall Street were irked executives would consider selling Whiting now, after a nearly 60 percent drop in the company's stock since last summer. The logic of any deal seemed to contradict the dictum of buy low, sell high.Yet media reports last week indicated that the company, led by 67-year-old Chief Executive Officer Jim Volker, was pursuing an auction process, essentially shopping itself to find the highest bidder. The news surprised two people at the company who are regularly briefed by senior management.Investors said the timing would be inappropriate for a company known for having excellent acreage but whose share price has tumbled alongside oil.""This is not the way you run a deal process,"" said one major Whiting shareholder who declined to be named, citing concern he might offend the company's management. The investor said he was ""pissed"" the company would even casually entertain the idea of any sale in this environment. Investors also disliked the idea of seeing fast-growing Whiting bought out by a slow-growing U.S. major oil company such as Chevron Corp or Exxon Mobil in an all-stock deal, insisting the company can go it alone despite what is expected to be an increase in buyouts across the energy industry.""I would much rather own shares of Whiting than shares in a multinational"" oil company, a second major investor said.ASSET SALES  Whiting has more than 64,000 acres in the Permian shale formation of western Texas holding roughly 17 percent of the company's total proven oil reserves.Much of this acreage is produced using waterflood and carbon dioxide injection, an expensive, older strategy typically favored by niche companies who prefer to operate on the fringe of the oil industry, not the fast-moving core of shale operations.The deal for the Permian assets could fetch more than $300 million, according to a separate source and analyst valuations.Whiting has signaled for weeks that its pipeline and gas processing facilities are part of any possible asset sales, telling analysts last month, for example, that its Redtail processing plant could fetch interest.The strategy is not new. In 2012, Whiting sold a 50 percent stake in a Belfield, North Dakota, processing plant to MDU Resources Inc for $66 million to pay down debt.Appetite for partnerships or outright sales could be higher now after Kinder Morgan paid $3 billion two months ago to buy North Dakota pipeline and logistics company Highland Partners.""There's definitely a red-hot market right now for midstream assets,"" one Whiting investor said.

""The exploration of this block is aligned with Chevron's long-term strategy to find and develop resources that will help meet the growing energy needs in the Asia Pacific region,"" said Brad Middleton, managing director of Chevron Asia South Business Unit.Chevron's subsidiary Unocal Myanmar Offshore Co.

""They are most likely shipping it to Australia as otherwise there is no point paying up the premium for the special grade,"" said the source, who declined to be named as he was not authorised to speak to the media.It was not clear how much Chevron paid for the cargo, but traders said it was sold at a high premium.PetroChina, China's top gasoline exporter, is currently able to produce a maximum of about 30,000 tonnes a month of gasoline that is able to meet Australian specifications, the source said, equivalent to about one medium-sized tanker load. China's West Pacific Petrochemical Corp, or WEPEC, will be able to produce Australian grade gasoline from May, once it starts a new gasoline-making continuous catalytic reformer unit, a second source close to the matter said.Top Chinese refiner Sinopec Corp is also able to produce gasoline meeting Australian specifications, a third source said, although it has yet to export to Australia.Some Sinopec refineries are already producing fuel with a low 10 parts-per-million (ppm) sulphur for domestic use, ahead of plans to adopt this as standard in China by 2018, the source said.Australia has more stringent specifications for fuel than other countries in Asia, requiring a lower sulphur content than many countries and lower reid vapour pressure (rvp) which measures fuel volatility, traders said. The country is expected to boost gasoline imports as super-sized Asian refineries have made the local industry increasingly uncompetitive. BP plans to close its 102,000 barrels per day Bulwer refinery in May.Australia imported about 380,000 tonnes of gasoline in January this year, its highest level since December, 2011, latest official statistics showed.Imports come mainly from South Korea and Singapore and some volumes from India, traders said.China exported nearly 4.983 million tonnes of gasoline last year, up 6 percent from a year earlier, customs data showed,     with most cargoes going to Singapore, Indonesia and Vietnam.Chinese export data shows a cargo of 31,488 tonnes was shipped to Australia in February last year, although traders said they were not aware of any shipments. Official Australian data showed no gasoline imports from China in 2014.Chevron, PetroChina, Sinopec and WEPEC could not immediately be reached for official comment.

235,"   By Nate Raymond  Chevron Corp urged a U.S. appeals court on Monday to uphold a ruling finding that an American lawyer used corrupt means to secure a $9.5 billion pollution judgment in Ecuador.A lawyer for Chevron told the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York that Steven Donziger, a U.S. lawyer who represented a group of Ecuadorians that sued the oil giant, pursued a case ""shot through with fraud.""""What happened here was a fraud on the Ecuadorian courts,"" Theodore Olson, Chevron's lawyer, said.Olson asked the three-judge panel to uphold a ban on Donziger profiting from the case and from the attorney or villagers enforcing the judgment in the United States.But Donziger's lawyer said allowing Chevron to launch an ""impermissible collateral attack"" on a foreign judgment could prompt similar challenges in the future.""The problem is, how do you write an opinion that does not open the door to attacks on judgments from around the world?"" Deepak Gupta, Donziger's lawyer, said. The appeal follows years of litigation by the villagers, who sued Texaco, which Chevron later acquired, over contamination in the jungle around Lago Agrio, Ecuador, between 1964 and 1992.The Ecuadoreans initially sued Chevron in federal court in Manhattan in 1993. After Chevron successfully argued the case should be heard in Ecuador, the villagers filed a new lawsuit there.The case led to a $19 billion judgment against Chevron, which Ecuador's highest court in 2013 slashed to $9.5 billion. Chevron, meanwhile, sued Donziger and others in federal court in Manhattan, claiming the judgment was the product of fraud.In 2014, U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan concluded that Donziger's team used bribery, fraud and extortion to secure the judgment. He barred Donziger from profiting from it and banned its enforcement in the United States.Chevron no longer has operations in Ecuador. But the plaintiffs have gone after its assets in Canada, Brazil and Argentina, and Kaplan's ruling provided ammunition against those efforts. On Monday, Circuit Judge Richard Wesley called the case ""unmanageable.""He said Kaplan's findings, for example, could soon be contradicted by an arbitration panel set to hear Chevron's claims against Ecuador that it was wrongly denied the right to a fair hearing.Wesley asked if a solution might be to rewind the clock to have the case tried in New York as the Ecuadorians originally wanted.""Why not order a retrial?"" he asked.

238,"  ATYRAU, Kazakhstan, April 21 Kazakhstan's leading oil producer has slowed its expansion plans further and cut planned spending this year in response to lower oil prices, a senior executive at Chevron's joint venture Tengizchevroil (TCO) said.""Global oil prices have dropped significantly, so we responded by slowing the project down and cutting spending for 2015,"" Aidar Dosbaev, TCO's head of production, said at a conference last week.As the oil price plunged in the second half of last year, TCO's crude output for 2014 dropped to 26.7 million tonnes, from 27.1 million tonnes in 2013.The company had planned to expand and increase annual production to 38 million tonnes, or 760,000 barrels per day, by 2021. Dosbaev did not specify when production would now reach that level but industry sources said it could be delayed by up to two years.TCO, which is 50 percent owned by Chevron, had originally planned to complete the expansion by 2019. Oil prices have almost halved from a peak last June to around $60 a barrel. Kazakhstan's government reviewed Tengiz's expansion project in October 2014 and was unhappy with TCO's plans to increase total spending on the project to $40 billion, from $23 billion.TCO's output is crucial to Kazakhstan's oil output this year and next before the giant Kashagan oil plant, which has been shut following gas leaks in its pipelines in October 2013, restarts production in the second half of 2016. Kazakhstan's oil production fell by 1.2 percent to 80.8 million tonnes last year. It is officially forecast to slip to 80.5 million this year.Kazakhstan, the second-largest ex-Soviet oil producer after Russia, holds a 20 percent stake in TCO via state oil and gas firm KazMunaiGas. Exxon Mobil has 25 percent and Lukarco, controlled by Russia's Lukoil, owns the remaining 5 percent.KazMunaiGas has adjusted its 2015 budget based on an average oil price of $50 a barrel, slashing capital expenditures by 26 percent to $457 million and cutting output plans by 1 percent.

239,"   By Reem Shamseddine | KHOBAR, Saudi Arabia, April 22  KHOBAR, Saudi Arabia, April 22 A Saudi Arabian unit of U.S. oil major Chevron has told its Kuwaiti partner it plans to shut down an oilfield jointly operated between the two Gulf OPEC countries next month over long-standing disputes, three industry sources familiar with the matter said.The planned closure in May of the joint Wafra onshore oilfield in the Neutral Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait was communicated by Saudi Arabian Chevron to Kuwait Gulf Oil Company, according to the sources.This comes after the crude output from another jointly operated field, Khafji, was halted in October to comply with environmental regulations.Chevron's decision was mainly down to problems getting work permits from the Kuwaiti authorities for its expatriate staff, the sources said. ""Current difficulties in securing work permits and materials may impact the company's ability to safely continue production. Efforts continue with all appropriate parties to resolve the issue,"" said Sally Jones, Chevron spokeswoman in an emailed statement.Saudi and Kuwait oil officials could not be reached immediately for comment. The loss of Wafra, which has an output capacity of around 200,000-250,000 barrels per day of Arabian Heavy crude, will be felt more in Kuwait, which has far less spare output than its neighbour, the world's top oil exporter.Chevron has been leading a full-field steam injection project in the onshore Wafra field to boost output of heavy oil there by more than 80,000 bpd. Diplomatic and industry sources have told Reuters that Kuwait has been placing restrictions on Chevron which operates Wafra on behalf of Saudi Arabia, as a result of various disputes mainly related to the right to operate.The sources say Kuwait was angry because it was not consulted when the Chevron concession to operate Wafra was renewed by Riyadh in 2009 until 2039.(Reporting by Reem Shamseddine in Khobar and Amena Bakr in Doha, additional reporting by Rania El Gamal in Dubai and Ahmed Hagagy in Kuwait; editing by Keith Weir)",2015-04-22,CVX,"Wed Apr 22, 2015 | 3:39am EDT",Chevron Saudi unit plans to shut joint Kuwait oilfield in May,http://www.reuters.com//article/saudi-kuwait-oilfield-idUSL5N0XI41820150422?type=companyNews

241,"   By Ernest Scheyder  Oil and natural gas producer Chevron Corp (CVX.N) reported a 43 percent drop in quarterly profit on Friday, though results beat analysts' expectations as cost cuts and robust refining margins helped offset the impact of tumbling crude prices.The help from refining operations mirrored results at large, integrated peers such as Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L), which tend to lean on their refining divisions for profit during times of cheap oil.Oil prices CLc1 LCOc1 have slumped more than 40 percent since last June amid a glut of global supply, harming Chevron's division that produces oil and gas, its largest, but helping profit more than double to $1.42 billion at its refining arm.A Reuters analysis of industry data, though, shows that this ""refining boom"" for the sector isn't likely to last long, and that producers' best chance for improving profit is higher oil prices.""The good thing about the quarter is that it's over,"" said Fadel Gheit, an oil analyst at Oppenheimer in New York. ""Going forward, costs will continue to go down and oil prices are slowly going up, so margins will improve."" Chevron has sold $4 billion in assets so far this year, part of a broader divestment plan to help fund its dividend from cash flow. ""We will continue to sell assets when we can generate good value,"" Chief Financial Officer Pat Yarrington said on a conference call with investors. ""Maintaining a competitive and growing dividend is our No. 1 priority.""        Shares of the San Ramon, California-based company fell 2.3 percent to $108.48 in afternoon trading. EXCEEDING EXPECTATIONS         The No. 2 U.S. oil company reported net income of $2.57 billion, or $1.37 per share, down from $4.51 billion, or $2.36 a share, a year earlier, but much better than analysts' expectations of 79 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Chevron posted a loss in its United States oil production division, a key indicator that the country is one of its highest cost areas.     Production grew 4 percent to 2.68 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, boosted largely by operations in the United States, Bangladesh and Argentina.Chevron continued slashing costs during the first quarter, reducing operating expenses by 9 percent. The company is renegotiating contracts with nearly 3,000 vendors and expects to wring about $900 million in cost savings out of them this year, Yarrington said.

249,"   By Anna Driver | HOUSTON  HOUSTON Shareholders of the top two U.S. oil companies on Wednesday rejected proposals to add directors with climate change expertise to their boards, but a measure passed at one, Chevron Corp, could give new power to minority investors with environmental concerns.Proposals to add an independent director with expertise in climate change received the support of about 20 percent of shareholders at each company, according to preliminary tallies provided at Chevron's annual meeting and that of Exxon Mobil Corp.By contrast, an advisory proposal allowing Chevron shareholders with stakes of at least 3 percent to nominate independent directors passed.

251,"  (Adds industry source, background)DUBAI May 27 An jointly-operated onshore oilfield between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait will remain shut until difficulties to operate there are resolved, a spokeswoman for U.S. oil major Chevron said on Wednesday.The Wafra field was shut for maintenance on May 11 for two weeks in a move apparently aimed at giving the Gulf OPEC allies time to solve a longstanding dispute.Last month, Saudi Chevron told its partner, Kuwait Gulf Oil Company, that it planned to shut down Wafra after failing to resolve various disputes with Kuwait, mainly related to the right to operate, according to industry sources.Chevron has said it has faced problems obtaining supplies and work permits for its expatriate staff, which could hurt production in the Neutral Zone.""Current difficulties in securing work permits and materials have impacted the company's operations,"" Chevron spokeswoman Sally Jones said in a statement on Wednesday. Chevron operates the Wafra onshore oilfield on behalf of Saudi Arabia. ""While efforts continue with all appropriate parties to resolve the issue, Saudi Arabian Chevron and Kuwait Gulf Oil Company have stopped production at the onshore Partitioned Zone. Production will remain shut in until the situation is resolved,"" Jones said.Production from the onshore fields in the Neutral Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait was about 190,000 barrels per day, a Kuwaiti industry source has said. The Neutral Zone is the only place in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait where foreign oil firms have equity in fields, which are otherwise owned and operated by state oil companies. Crude output is divided equally between the two countries.It survived the nationalisation of the Saudi oil industry in the 1970s. Since then, Saudi reserves of 264 billion barrels, about a fifth of the world's proven oil reserves, have been off limits to international oil companies.Industry sources say Kuwait was angry because it was not consulted when the Chevron concession to operate Wafra was renewed by Riyadh in 2009 until 2039. But the row goes back further to 2007, when a land dispute between Kuwait and Saudi Arabia led to a delay in Kuwait's plans to build an oil refinery.Chevron holds a lease on some of the land on Kuwait's side which was earmarked for the new refinery.""I don't think you will see any change of the status quo until the end of the third quarter, people from Chevron will keep leaving the country because of the expiration of their visas,"" said an industry source in Kuwait.The shutdown of Wafra, which has an output capacity of about 220,000 bpd of Arabian Heavy crude, comes after the oil output from another jointly operated field, Khafji, was stopped in October to comply with environmental regulations.

252,"   By Anna Driver | HOUSTON  HOUSTON May 27 Progressive shareholders are pushing to add directors with climate change expertise to the boards of Exxon Mobil Corp and Chevron Corp, arguing the largest U.S. oil companies need more depth of knowledge to navigate environmental issues.Climate and greenhouse gas proposals regularly surface at oil company annual meetings, but Wednesday will be the first time shareholders at Exxon will vote on putting an independent climate expert on the board.The measure will also be voted on at Chevron's annual meeting on Wednesday after being rejected by an average of 77 percent of votes cast in previous years.Boards of both companies oppose the idea, which has the support of influential proxy advisory service Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. Oil companies, while acknowledging the need to address climate change risks, have said it will take decades to develop technologies that economically capture carbon emissions. In January, Europe's Royal Dutch Shell Plc backed a measure from activist investors asking it to be more proactive about planning for climate change.""Just one authoritative figure with acknowledged expertise and standing could perform a valuable role in ways that would enable the board to more effectively address the environmental issues and risks inherent in its present business model regarding climate change,"" said the proposal for Exxon. Father Mike Crosby, who lives in a community of Roman Catholic friars in Milwaukee, is sponsoring the proposal at Exxon. He said he is tired of pressing for more accountability on climate issues at the Irving, Texas company.""If they had done something 20 years ago we could have a different world right now,"" Crosby said in an interview. Crosby, whose church group owns about 300 Exxon shares, said his efforts to talk to Exxon directors about climate were rebuffed so he proposed the addition of a climate expert to the board.Alan Jeffers, a spokesman for Exxon, said in an email that Father Crosby will have an opportunity to press his case in front of the board at the annual meeting.Exxon said in its proxy that board members have a broad range of expertise, including environmental and climate experience.Chevron's board said ""its current membership possesses significant environmental experience and that each board member should possess a broad range of skills,"" according to its proxy filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

255,"  WELLINGTON, June 2 New Zealand petrol retailer Z Energy Ltd said on Tuesday it plans to acquire Chevron Corp's downstream operations in the country as the U.S. energy company unloads assets in the region in response to falling oil prices and struggling margins.Under the NZ$785 million ($556.41 million) deal, Z Energy will pick up all of the roughly 150 Caltex service stations and 70 truck fuelling stations operated by Chevron, along with its lubricant interests, adding to Z Energy's 210 Z service stations.""The acquisition is ... a great fit with our longer term market growth strategy,"" Z Energy Chief Executive Officer Mike Bennetts said in a statement, adding that the company would operate the two brands separately. ""Caltex is a successful and highly attractive business in New Zealand and the acquisition means we can use the scale of the combined operation for the expanded supply of biodiesel to a broader market."" The transaction, which is being advised by Goldman Sachs,  will be financed through a combination of existing cash, committed term debt and standby facilities, and an underwritten pro rata equity raising of NZ$185 million closer to the settlement date. The announcement follows the U.S. petrol company's block sale last week of its 11.4 percent stake in the Refining NZ, the country's only oil refinery, which raised around NZ$80 million.Earlier this year, Chevron sold its entire stake in ASX-listed Caltex Australia Chevron in a block sale worth A$4.7 billion ($3.57 billion).

256,"  (Adds comments from Exxon, Chevron)By Ron Bousso and Susanna TwidaleLONDON, June 1 Europe's top oil and gas companies urged governments around the world to introduce a pricing system for carbon emissions, as governments meet in Bonn, Germany, on Monday to work on a U.N. deal to fight climate change.Criticised for not doing enough to tackle climate change, the chief executives of BG Group, BP, Eni , Royal Dutch Shell, Statoil and France's Total said carbon pricing ""would reduce uncertainty and encourage the most cost-effective ways of reducing carbon emissions widely.""In a joint statement, the companies acknowledged ""the current trend"" in greenhouse gas emissions is too high to meet the United Nation's target for limiting global warming by no more than 2 degrees.""Our industry faces a challenge: we need to meet greater energy demand with less CO2. We are ready to meet that challenge and we are prepared to play our part,"" the leaders of the six companies said.""We firmly believe that carbon pricing will discourage high carbon options and reduce uncertainty that will help stimulate investments in the right low-carbon technologies and the right resources at the right pace.""NOTABLE ABSENTEES  U.S. oil majors ExxonMobil and Chevron chose not to take part in the initiative, an industry source said.Exxon said it was aware of the letter. Like Chevron, Exxon said it works with the International Petroleum Industry Environmental Conservation Association (IPIECA), a trade group, to develop a common position for climate change mitigation.""It's clear that there is a difference of views on each side of the Atlantic,"" Patrick Pouyanne, Total's Chief Executive, told reporters during a news briefing.He said he and his counterparts from BP, Shell and Statoil had once met at a roundtable in Oslo and agreed on the European initiative.""Instead of waiting for the smallest common denominator, we got convinced it was worth making a commitment as European oil majors, as we command a significant share of the oil market, without necessarily waiting for an American to come on board."" Pouyanne said he was in talks with the two U.S. oil majors however and that he hoped that one of them would join the European initiative quickly.In May, Ken Cohen, Exxon's head of public policy, wrote a blog that said a ""revenue-neutral carbon tax,"" a scheme that shares similarities with carbon pricing, would be better at reducing greenhouse gas emissions than mandates.The letter from the European companies was first published by the Financial Times on Sunday.Climate Group, a non-profit advocacy, urged the world's biggest economies to respond positively to the initiative. ""This is a symbolic moment, and demonstrates an important if not universal shift. It reflects a growing realisation within influential sectors of the fossil fuel industry of a need to adapt to both market and climate realities,"" Mark Kenber, Climate Group chief executive, said in a statement.Setting a price for each ton of carbon that emitters produce is meant to encourage companies to adopt cleaner technologies and shift away from using fossil fuels, primarily coal.China is the world's biggest carbon emitter.The U.N. and World Bank have been strong advocates for policies that shift the responsibility to polluters to pay for carbon emissions.""Business used to wait for governments for policy perfection, they are no longer waiting. They are moving forward, providing support and encouragement to national and international actions, because addressing climate change is their best policy for business continuity,"" Christiana Figueres, head of the U.N. climate change secretariat, said at a carbon market event in Barcelona last week.According to a report published by the World Bank last week 40 nations and over 20 cities, states and regions now have a price on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, covering around 12 percent of annual global greenhouse gas emissions, or the equivalent of nearly 7 billion tonnes of CO2.The value of global schemes to price carbon, including trading schemes and taxes, totaled almost $50 billion as of April 1, the World Bank said.Governments from more than 190 nations from June 1 to June 11 will work towards streamlining a draft text of a U.N. deal to fight climate change due to be agreed in Paris in December.

259,"  June 2 Chevron Corp has deployed robots on the seafloor near its Big Foot deepwater oil project, aiming to find just how much damage it must contend with after six giant tendons sank and indefinitely delayed the start of production at the platform.The company, the No. 2 U.S. oil producer, said late Monday it would move the Big Foot platform away from the site after tendons, which look like a long series of interlocking metal pipes and tether platforms to seabeds, failed to float.The setback means Chevron will not meet its goal of bringing Big Foot production online by the end of the year. The site, 225 miles south of New Orleans in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, is expected to produce 75,000 barrels of oil per day once it opens.Remote-operated vehicle (ROV) robots, which are equipped with cameras, have been deployed to the site and ""are assessing the damage at this time,"" Chevron spokesman Cam Van Ast said.The company plans to update its timeline for bringing Big Foot online during its July earnings conference call, Van Ast said. Wells Fargo analyst Roger Read said on Tuesday the setback was ""clearly a negative from production, cash flow and operational excellence standpoints.""The Big Foot platform was engineered to be tied by 16 metal rod tendons to a base on the seafloor 5,200 feet below water. The tendons, which range in diameter from 24 inches (61 cm)to 32 inches (81 cm), were designed to be buoyant and stay in place until the platform was moved atop them and connected. Four tendons were engineered to connect to each of the platform's corners.Effectively, six of the tendons failed, sinking to the seabed floor. It is not yet known if the tendons that sank can be salvaged or if new ones will need to be built. It also was not immediately clear who constructed the tendons for Chevron. An investor presentation by Houston-based Oil States International Inc said the company had worked on some tendon components of Big Foot.A unit of Dynamic Industries Inc was contracted to work on commissioning and mechanical offshore construction services. Neither company was immediately available for comment.Chevron is the project's operator, with a 60 percent stake. Statoil ASA and Marubeni Oil & Gas hold the remainder.

263,"  BANGKOK, June 2 Thailand's PTT PCL said it plans to negotiate arrangements for import of liquefied natural gas (LNG) with several gas suppliers, including Chevron Corp, to offset a decline in domestic resources and to secure long-term supply.State-controlled PTT also plans to expand its partnership with Qatar Liquefied Gas Co Ltd, a major long-term LNG supplier, PTT chief executive Pailin Chuchottaworn said in a statement released while attending the World Gas Conference in Paris this week.PTT, Thailand's sole gas supplier, has a 20-year contract to buy 2 million tonnes of LNG a year from Qatar starting this year.The company has so far not revealed the names of the firms with which it is talks for LNG supplies, except for Anadarko Petroleum Corp, an operator of a Mozambique gas field in which PTT's unit has a stake Natural gas is used for almost 70 percent of Thailand's power generation. About a fifth of supplies are piped from Myanmar.But imports from Myanmar are likely to fall, given Thailand's neighbour is expected to use more of its natural gas resources for its own development. PTT executives also planned to have talks with Malaysia's Petronas about potential LNG cooperation in the future, the statement said.To secure short term supply, PTT is looking to form partnerships with France's Total SA and Shell  about possibilities to buy LNG from the spot market, it said without elaborating.

264,"  VIENNA, June 3 Chevron Chief Executive Officer John Watson on Wednesday rejected calls by European peers to introduce a price for carbon emissions, saying the region should instead focus on shale gas and nuclear power.In a blunt speech to the OPEC seminar in Vienna, Watson elaborated on why he opted not to join the heads of Europe's six top oil and gas companies including Royal Dutch Shell, BP and Total in a letter published earlier this week urging governments around the world to introduce a pricing system for carbon emissions.""I understand the concerns but I don't think putting a price on carbon is an answer... I don't think it is a policy that can be effective,"" Watson said.Instead, Europe should develop its gas resources, he said, alluding to the reluctance of European governments to develop shale gas in a process known as fracking which has radically transformed the U.S. market. ""We need to make sure we develop the natural gas resources that we have, here in Europe - although Europe is choosing not to develop its resources - but also elsewhere in the world."" Nuclear power, which fell out of favour around the world, particularly in Germany, was also key to reducing carbon emissions, Watson said.""If we are serious about climate change - nuclear power would be on the agenda. We wouldn't be shutting down nuclear plants around the world,"" he said. Chevron larger U.S. peer ExxonMobil also chose not to join the joint letter, revealing a rift between the European and U.S. views on the debate over climate change.Setting a price for each tonne of carbon that emitters produce is meant to encourage companies to adopt cleaner technologies and shift away from using fossil fuels, primarily coal.

268,"   By Terry Wade and Ernest Scheyder | HOUSTON/WILLISTON, N.D., June 11  HOUSTON/WILLISTON, N.D., June 11 Engineers examining why nine giant tendons sank at Chevron Corp's  Big Foot deepwater oil project are considering whether buoys taking on water, combined with a strong current that prevented vessels from repairing them, caused the costly setback, a source familiar with the matter said.Though it will be months before the investigation is complete, the sinking of the tendons 225 miles south of New Orleans has delayed the project indefinitely, harming Chevron's plans to produce 75,000 barrels of oil and 25 million cubic feet of natural gas per day by year's end.""It's not appropriate to speculate on cause as we are still assessing damage to the tendons and undertaking an investigation,"" Chevron spokesman Cam Van Ast said.Sixteen tendons, each roughly a mile (1.6 km) long, were designed to float upright with the help of a buoy system until the Big Foot platform could be moved atop them and connected, the source said.Four tendons were engineered to connect to each of the platform's corners, and tie the platform to the seabed. However, the buoyancy system apparently failed to operate as designed and began taking on water in the mile-deep waters of the Gulf.It is not clear why the buoys failed. But at some point vessels sent to inject them with air and displace the water could not reach them due to the Gulf's loop current, according to the source. The loop current is a warm flow of fast-moving water that flows into the Gulf from the Caribbean Sea, past Mexico's Yucatan peninsula and east toward the Florida coastline before looping in the Gulf Stream and out into the Atlantic.Its location can change from time to time, making navigation difficult, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.""You shouldn't have to add air,"" the same source said of the buoy system. ""You wouldn't design something to slowly take on water."" The source could not be identified because he is not authorized to speak publicly about it. Chevron declined to comment when asked if vessels reached the buoy system or why they filled with water.It is not clear if the remaining seven buoys have been reinflated.The delay to the $5.1 billion Big Foot project comes as San Ramon, Calif.-based Chevron deals with setbacks at several mega-projects it needs to lift daily output to 3.1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) by 2017.Statoil ASA and Marubeni Oil & Gas hold minority stakes in the project.

271,"   By Anna Driver and Michael Erman | HOUSTON/NEW YORK  HOUSTON/NEW YORK Steep downward revisions to oil and gas reserves at the end of this year are likely to increase scrutiny of how energy companies tally future barrels - a process that has become more opaque with the rise of shale drilling.The revisions due in December will reflect a deep plunge in crude prices and should not come as a surprise for investors who have been pouring billions of dollars into U.S. oil companies betting that crude prices will recover.But investors may not fully appreciate other risks stemming from the wide variety of methods companies use to estimate and vet their reserves, or economically-recoverable oil and gas.Reserves have long underpinned company stock prices. Reserve growth is used at companies, including ConocoPhillips as a component of the chief executive's compensation.Yet there is plenty of uncertainty in the industry as measuring unconventional resources such as shale oil is a young science and there is no uniform process for reserve reporting, geologists, investors and lawyers say.In contrast to financial reporting, the U.S. Securities Exchange Commision does not require outside auditing for reserves. That leaves the process ""a little opaque"" according to Stewart Glickman, director of energy research at S&P Capital IQ in New York. A Reuters analysis of public filings by companies in the Dow Jones U.S. Oil and Gas index reveals a wide variety of  practices used to report them. Of the 41 exploration and production companies in the Dow Jones Oil and Gas Producers Index, 15 companies had independent petroleum engineers generate their reserves estimates for them.Another 18 companies came up with the estimates themselves and had an independent engineering firm audit those results, Securities and Exchange Commission filings show. Four of the firms generated their own results and had consultants review the procedures and methods used to prepare the estimate, but not review the underlying data. Meanwhile, four other companies had no outside reviews. Exxon Mobil Corp, Chevron Corp, Murphy Oil Corp and Newfield Exploration Co prepared the reserve estimates entirely on their own.Chevron and Exxon both said they take a rigorous approach to booking reserves and comply with all relevant standards.Newfield said it has always reported its own reserves.""Our founder often stated that 'no one knows the reserves like our own engineers,'"" spokesman Steve Campbell said.John Lee, a reserves expert at the University of Houston, said the SEC debated whether to require an outside reserve auditor when modernizing rules in 2009, but ultimately decided a company's own engineers knew acreage better than third parties.He also said there likely would not be enough auditors available to do the work if an independent evaluation were required. The SEC declined comment. Bala Dharan, a professor at Harvard Law School, said that while progress was made after the 2009 SEC changes, more could be done.     ""The next step would be to look at the feasibility of requiring more widespread adoption of external review,"" he said.CAUTIONARY TALE     Another source of concern is a provision introduced in 2009 when the SEC modernized reserve rules that allows companies to add reserves by letting companies report reserves from undrilled locations provided they plan to develop the property within five years. Since then, the SEC has sent letters to dozens of companies to inquire about their ""proved undeveloped reserves"" and at times demanded some be removed, according to public filings and lawyers. In May, well-known short-seller David Einhorn took aim at shale oil companies, saying most of their undeveloped reserves cannot be profitably produced..   Samantha Holroyd, who is responsible for valuing and managing oil and gas properties for private equity firm Denham Capital in Houston, offered a cautionary tale.She had about $50 million to invest and was given a reserve report about a seller's acreage that had been reviewed by a third-party consultancy. She later discovered the firm had not done any extra work and just regurgitated the client's numbers.""I was potentially having the wool pulled over my eyes,"" she told a recent meeting of petroleum engineers in Houston.The lack of clarity around reserves reporting adds to a longstanding criticism of the shale industry's capital intensive business model, in which new wells must be constantly drilled to replace output from existing ones that rapidly decline.Calculating how much oil and gas can be produced from conventional resources has always been an inexact science.But wells drilled into shales and other rocks have made the process even tougher as such oil reserves vary a lot between wells. Experts also say the industry has little grasp on the actual length and width of cracks made in rock by hydraulic fracturing. Those cracks, made by blasting chemicals, water and sand down a well, largely determine a well's production.""The problem is more difficult in shale,"" said the University of Houston's Lee. ""We don't have measurement techniques that are sufficiently accurate.""

280,"   By Jacob Gronholt-Pedersen | SINGAPORE  SINGAPORE Refiners on the U.S. West Coast and Hawaii have stepped up purchases of Russian crude, taking advantage of a narrow gap between U.S. and global prices as they look to guard against a seasonal shortage of Alaskan supply, trade and industry sources said.Up to four tankers were expected to carry nearly 3 million barrels of Russia's ESPO crude from Kozmino near the city of Vladivostok to refineries in the United States this month and next, the sources said. That will help Russia diversify beyond key buyers in China, South Korea and Japan at a time when Asian markets are grappling with oversupply. Sanctions against Russia over its actions in Ukraine bar U.S. oil companies from drilling in the country, but purchases of oil are still allowed. But traders said the shipments marked only a temporary trend as refineries were buying amid uncertainty over the supply of Alaska North Slope (ANS) crude during the summer months. ANS is regularly shipped to the U.S. West Coast, but production normally falls in summer due to field maintenance.""I don't see a huge pull from the West Coast apart from what has been bought already,"" said one trader with a company operating a refinery in California. Reuters ship tracking data confirms that the Aegean Power tanker loaded 730,000 barrels of ESPO crude last week and is due to arrive at the Long Beach refining hub in Los Angeles on July 9.One industry source, who was not authorized to speak to the media, said Chevron Corp likely bought the cargo for processing at its El Segundo refinery in Los Angeles. A spokesman for the U.S. oil major declined to comment.  Two or three additional cargoes are due to load either later this month or next, with Valero Energy Corp shipping Russian crude to one of its two refineries on the U.S. West Coast, and Par Petroleum taking at least one cargo to Hawaii, according to four trade and industry sources.A Valero spokesman declined to comment on the issue, but said the company was waiting for approval for a terminal that would allow rail shipments of North American crude to be delivered to its Benicia refinery near San Francisco ""lessening the reliance on foreign crudes"".Par Petroleum did not reply to emailed questions. The price gap between U.S. crude and international benchmarks like Brent and Dubai has tightened, with global prices weighed down by near-record OPEC production while the U.S. market has been supported by slowing output and higher gasoline use.ESPO was regularly shipped to the United States after production began in 2009, but trade slowed.

281,"  * Move comes amid worries of seasonal dent in Alaskan supply* Gap between U.S., international crude prices narrows* Russian oil exports exempt from sanctionsBy Jacob Gronholt-PedersenSINGAPORE, June 24 Refiners on the U.S. West Coast and Hawaii have stepped up purchases of Russian crude, taking advantage of a narrow gap between U.S. and global prices as they look to guard against a seasonal shortage of Alaskan supply, trade and industry sources said.Up to four tankers were expected to carry nearly 3 million barrels of Russia's ESPO crude from Kozmino near the city of Vladivostok to refineries in the United States this month and next, the sources said. That will help Russia diversify beyond key buyers in China, South Korea and Japan at a time when Asian markets are grappling with oversupply. Sanctions against Russia over its actions in Ukraine bar U.S. oil companies from drilling in the country, but purchases of oil are still allowed.But traders said the shipments marked only a temporary trend as refineries were buying amid uncertainty over the supply of Alaska North Slope (ANS) crude during the summer months. ANS is regularly shipped to the U.S. West Coast, but production normally falls in summer due to field maintenance.""I don't see a huge pull from the West Coast apart from what has been bought already,"" said one trader with a company operating a refinery in California. Reuters ship tracking data confirms that the Aegean Power tanker loaded 730,000 barrels of ESPO crude last week and is due to arrive at the Long Beach refining hub in Los Angeles on July 9.One industry source, who was not authorised to speak to the media, said Chevron Corp likely bought the cargo for processing at its El Segundo refinery in Los Angeles. A spokesman for the U.S. oil major declined to comment. Two or three additional cargoes are due to load either later this month or next, with Valero Energy Corp shipping Russian crude to one of its two refineries on the U.S. West Coast, and Par Petroleum taking at least one cargo to Hawaii, according to four trade and industry sources.A Valero spokesman declined to comment on the issue, but said the company was waiting for approval for a terminal that would allow rail shipments of North American crude to be delivered to its Benicia refinery near San Francisco ""lessening the reliance on foreign crudes"".Par Petroleum did not reply to emailed questions.The price gap between U.S. crude and international benchmarks like Brent and Dubai has tightened, with global prices weighed down by near-record OPEC production while the U.S. market has been supported by slowing output and higher gasoline use.ESPO was regularly shipped to the United States after production began in 2009, but trade slowed.

283,"   By Anna Driver | HOUSTON  HOUSTON Petty legal filings. Diversionary ballot measures. Counting abstentions as no votes. These are just some of the tactics U.S. oil companies used this spring to quash efforts by investors to win the right to nominate climate experts for board seats.Led by New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer and proposed at 75 U.S. companies in various industries this year, the so-called proxy access measure would give investor groups who own 3 percent of a company for more than three years the right to nominate directors. At the 19 oil and gas companies targeted, the aim was to demand more accountability on global warming.While the non-binding measure passed at two-thirds of all the companies targeted, and at 15 of the 19 energy companies, some took unusual steps to block it. Oilfield services provider Nabors Industries Ltd, for example, counted non-votes from brokers as votes against the proposal. Still, the measure passed at Nabors, which didn’t respond to requests for comment.Shale oil company Pioneer Natural Resources Co filed a last-minute counterproposal calling for a higher ownership threshold of 5 percent, which institutional investors say is much harder to obtain. Pioneer said it gave shareholders extra time to vote. Stringer's proposal failed.Exxon Mobil Corp and Chevron Corp tried to block the proposal by arguing the New York City pension funds behind it had not shown proof of owning their shares for a full year. The proposal passed at Chevron and narrowly failed at Exxon.The 15 victories at energy companies show that investors think the companies must do more to address climate change risks - which range from shortages of water needed for drilling to hefty carbon taxes governments could impose on fossil fuel producers, fund managers said. ""ExxonMobil received this (proxy access) proposal due to its exposure to risk related to climate change,"" James Andrus, a representative from Calpers, told Exxon's annual meeting. The outcome also shows companies miscalculated the groundswell of support for more climate accountability ahead of the U.N. conference on global warming in December, fund managers said.A simple majority was needed for the non-binding proposal to pass. Of the 19 targeted energy companies, all opposed the measure, except for shale oil producers Apache Corp and Whiting Petroleum Corp.. The other two companies where the measure failed were Cabot Oil and Gas Corp and Noble Energy Inc.      'PETTY LEGAL ACTIONS' Stringer characterized Chevron and Exxon's maneuvers as ""petty legal actions"" in a statement made in February. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sided with New York.Because the measures are non-binding, corporate boards can either ignore the results of the votes or decide to change their bylaws. While most companies say their boards' nominating committees are best suited to pick nominees for director, energy companies in particular likely do not want the type of board candidates that labor pension funds might promote, said Erik Gordon, clinical assistant professor at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business.""Companies fear that the nominees will be single issue candidates who focus solely on a labor or environmental issue such as executive compensation or global warming,"" said Gordon. ""In fact, the Comptroller's office has targeted companies that it feels have done too little to address climate change, and that frightens energy companies.""Steven Mueller, chief executive officer of Southwestern Energy Co, told Reuters that his board opposed the proxy access proposal because Southwestern was unfairly targeted because it produces oil and natural gas. The proposal passed at Southwestern.""We didn't believe it was a governance issue,"" said Mueller, who said Southwestern's board is working on how to respond to the proposal.

285,"   By Oleg Vukmanovic  and Osamu Tsukimori | MILAN/TOKYO  MILAN/TOKYO Chevron's $54 billion Gorgon LNG project - the world's most expensive - may be forced to dump chunks of its early production onto an already saturated global spot market, as some Japanese clients warn they are unlikely to take up test shipments.This would be another blow for a project hit by billions of dollars in cost overruns and underscores the difficulties for a raft of Australian liquefied natural gas developments facing subdued demand and competition from U.S. shale gas.After nearly five years of construction, test exports of LNG from Gorgon's 15.6 million-tonnes-a-year (mtpa) plant off western Australia are due to begin late this year and last until April 2016, when commercial deliveries will likely start.Japanese buyers holding long-term supply contracts have in the past eagerly sought early cargoes, but some could pass on the test shipments with long-term prices well above spot prices languishing at four-year lows. ""At this point there is no plan,"" a spokesman at Tokyo Gas said, when asked whether it planned to take the first of the test, or commissioning, cargoes.The firm has a contract to take 1.1 mtpa from the project. A senior official from another Japanese client also said it was unlikely to buy these cargoes. ""If there's spot supply that's cheaper than Chevron's offer price, then we'll not take from Chevron,"" said the official, who   declined to be identified.Asked about sales of the test cargoes, a spokeswoman for Chevron said the company did not discuss activities related to LNG trading.Chevron will already have to sell some LNG on the spot market after securing 25-year sales deals for under 70 percent of its share of Gorgon LNG, according to company data, less than the 85 percent a project backer would normally seek to guarantee returns. The U.S. firm, which has a 47.3 percent stake in Gorgon,  has also signed a five-year deal with South Korea's SK LNG Trading to supply 0.83 mtpa starting from 2017. Australia is still on track to overtake Qatar as the world's top LNG supplier by the end of the decade, but expansions and some new plants at earlier stages are in doubt.Royal Dutch Shell Group's Arrow Energy shelved plans this year for a LNG plant at Queensland's Curtis Island.   Ernst and Young has said around $200 billion of deepwater oil and gas facilities globally have been canceled or put on hold in recent months due to the glut in energy supply.    OPT OUT CLAUSE Japanese buyers will take nearly a third of Gorgon's output once commercial sales start, but if test shipments are not taken up then up to 2.4 million tonnes of LNG could hit spot markets leading up to April, Reuters calculations based on company data showed. This is equivalent to about 36 standard-size cargoes and could add to pressure on spot prices that have lost 60 percent in 18 months, although early LNG volumes can be highly variable due to startup issues.While firms with long-term contracts would normally be obliged to take gas during the test phase, an industry source briefed by a buyer said Japanese clients had built in the right to pass when negotiating their contracts. Aside from Tokyo Gas, other Japanese buyers of Gorgon include Chubu Electric Power and Osaka Gas, which also have small equity stakes in the project, and Kyushu Electric Power and JX Nippon Oil.Whether or not they take commissioning cargoes will largely depend on how competitively priced they are versus spot. Chevron tied long-term contract sales of Gorgon supply to oil prices at an estimated 14.85 percent, or ""slope"", of a barrel of Brent crude, with a small $0.50-$1.00 premium.  That translates into an LNG price of $10.10 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) at current Brent prices, compared with spot LNG currently at $7.20 per mmBtu.Should oil rise towards year-end, as some analysts expect, the gap between Gorgon LNG supplies and spot prices could be stretched further.An Osaka Gas spokesman said no arrangements had been made for taking the first of the commissioning cargoes, though it was possible it could take some before the end of March.Chubu Electric and Kyushu Electric said the timing of the first delivery of gas was undecided, while JX Nippon declined to comment.Chevron could offer purchasers compensation to encourage them to take test shipments, a source familiar with the industry said. Japanese utilities could also wait to pick off odd commissioning cargoes if Chevron sells them on spot markets, as they did when ExxonMobil Corp brought its Papua New Guinea export plant on stream last year.Chevron, meanwhile, is said to have started sounding out potential buyers of test shipments.""They are dipping their toes in the market,"" said an Asian-based industry source, who said his company had been approached.The other major partners in Gorgon are ExxonMobil and  Shell, which each have 25 percent of the project.

287,"  BANGKOK, July 14 Thai refiner Star Petroleum Refining PCL (SPRC) could raise 20-25 billion baht ($588-$735 million) in an initial public offering that would also mark the exit of energy firm PTT PCL, two people with knowledge of the deal said on Tuesday.At the top-end of the range, the IPO would be Thailand's second biggest this year after telecoms group Jasmine International PCL listed a $1.7 billion internet fund in February.The deal is scheduled for the fourth quarter, the sources said. SPRC will sell 1.92 million shares in the IPO, largely made up from state-run PTT's 36 percent stake, it said in a regulatory filing last week.Executives at both SPRC and PTT, Thailand's largest energy firm, declined to comment on the pricing of the deal. The sources also declined to be named as the details of the IPO remained confidential. A subsidiary of U.S. firm Chevron Corp will remain the majority shareholder in SPRC after the IPO with a 55 percent, the sources added.PTT had long sought to sell its stake in SPRC amid criticism that it holds a monopoly over all aspects of the energy sector, but the IPO was delayed for years by regulatory snags and disagreements with the Chevron subsidiary. SPRC operates a 165,000 barrel-per-day refinery in eastern Rayong province and its capacity accounts for 13.2 percent of Thailand's total. SPRC made a net loss of $194 million last year, compared to a $128 million net profit in 2013, as global oil prices fell.Bualuang Securities, Finansa, Phatra Securities and Siam Commercial Bank are the deal's advisors, the sources said.($1 = 34.0200 baht)   (Reporting by Manunphattr Dhanananphorn and Khettiya Jittapong; Editing by Miral Fahmy)",2015-07-14,CVX,"Tue Jul 14, 2015 | 6:34am EDT",Thai Star Petroleum to raise up to $735 mln from IPO in Q4 - sources,http://www.reuters.com//article/thailand-starpetroleum-ipo-idUSL4N0ZU1XS20150714?type=companyNews

291,"   By Ernest Scheyder and Anna Driver  Weak oil prices shriveled quarterly profit at Exxon Mobil Corp and Chevron Corp on Friday, compelling both companies to rethink operations and plan for what many expect to be a sustained period of cheap crude.Earnings at U.S. oil majors Exxon, which were the worst in a decade, and Chevron missed analysts' expectations, adding to concerns that perhaps executives had not acted quickly enough to mitigate the impact of an over-50-percent drop in oil prices since last summer.The results highlight how smaller and more nimble U.S. shale oil companies have slashed costs faster and more aggressively than global majors. Some shale producers have cut back drilling by 60 percent or more.Evan Calio, an analyst with Morgan Stanley, said on Exxon's earnings conference call that the oil giant appeared to be less vocal than its peers about cutting costs.Jeff Woodbury, Exxon's head of investor relations, responded that the company was constantly focused on capital efficiency and cost management.    Still, Exxon is sticking for now with its plans to spend $34 billion this year, although that figure has a downward bias because of cost savings and efficiencies, Woodbury said.Chevron also still plans to spend $35 billion this year, but said it would spend less in 2016 and 2017 as several mega projects come online.CUTS AT EUROPEAN RIVALS  Exxon and Chevron's European peers such as Royal Dutch Shell Plc have taken more aggressive action. BP Plc cut its budget for the second time this year, while Shell said it would lay off 6,500 workers.   Exxon's profit fell by more than half, with the biggest drop in its exploration and production business, where earnings slumped by nearly $6 billionChevron's profit plunged 90 percent, a starker drop and one exacerbated by a $2.22 billion loss in its exploration and production division.Pat Yarrington, Chevron's chief financial officer, seeking to head off complaints about cost management, said the company had slashed about $3 billion in spending so far this year, and wasn't done. Still, analysts peppered her throughout the earnings call for details.  Though production grew at both companies, they missed the estimates of many analysts who had expected the energy giants to pump more.Shares of both slumped more than 3 percent in afternoon trading.  BRIGHT SPOT To be sure, the two companies benefited from their refining divisions, which make gasoline and other fuels. Refining units tend to be far more profitable when oil prices are low, providing Chevron and other integrated energy companies with an internal hedge during times when core operations, such as oil production, are weighed down by weak prices.Both companies stressed their ability to weather the price doldrums and emerge stronger. Chevron's Chief Executive John Watson, for instance, bluntly described the results as ""weak."" He laid off 2 percent of its staff earlier this week.""I think in general the industry is putting a sharper pencil to cost cutting,"" said Brian Youngberg, senior oil company analyst at Edward Jones in St Louis. ""I think they are realizing the days of $100 a barrel (oil) are over.""      Exxon also said Friday it would slow its share repurchase program. The company purchased $1 billion of its own stock in the second quarter, but expects to spend roughly half of that on repurchases in the third quarter.Chevron earlier this year scrapped its entire repurchase program.

He laid off 2 percent of its staff earlier this week.""I think in general the industry is putting a sharper pencil to cost cutting,"" said Brian Youngberg, senior oil company analyst at Edward Jones in St Louis. ""I think they are realizing the days of $100 a barrel (oil) are over.""Exxon also said Friday it would slow its share repurchase program. The company purchased $1 billion of its own stock in the second quarter, but expects to spend roughly half of that on repurchases in the third quarter.Chevron earlier this year scrapped its entire repurchase program.(Reporting by Ernest Scheyder in Williston, N.D., and Anna Driver in Houston; Editing by Terry Wade and Bernadette Baum)",2015-07-31,CVX,"Fri Jul 31, 2015 | 7:00pm EDT","WRAPUP 4-Tumbling oil prices slam profit at Exxon Mobil, Chevron",http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-oil-results-idUSL1N10B12Q20150731?type=companyNews

302,"   By Joseph Ax | NEW YORK  NEW YORK A U.S. appeals court on Tuesday rejected Ecuador's challenge to a $96 million international arbitration award in favor of energy giant Chevron Corp, marking the latest twist in a decades-long dispute over the development of oil fields in the South American country.The dispute stemmed from a 1973 deal that called for Texaco Petroleum Co, later acquired by Chevron, to develop oil fields in exchange for selling oil to the Ecuadorean government at below-market rates. Texaco filed several lawsuits in the 1990s accusing Ecuador of violating the contract.The District of Columbia U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a 2011 award from The Hague's Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Netherlands.Calls for comment to a lawyer for Ecuador and the Ecuadorean embassy in Washington were not immediately returned.The decision is not part of a separate legal battle brought by a group of Ecuadorean villagers who claim Texaco caused billions of dollars in pollution damage when it began exploring oil deposits in the 1960s. In the case at hand, Chevron initiated an arbitration proceeding at The Hague in 2006, claiming the Ecuadorean courts failed to resolve the lawsuits in a timely manner, violating a treaty between Ecuador and the United States. A panel awarded Chevron $96 million, which was subsequently upheld by the Dutch court system.Chevron then filed a federal lawsuit in Washington, seeking a judgment confirming the panel's decision in order to collect the award. After a federal judge affirmed the award in 2013, Ecuador appealed to the D.C. Circuit. ""In signing the (treaty), Ecuador agreed to arbitration of precisely this type of action,"" Circuit Judge Robert Wilkins wrote on Tuesday for a three-judge panel.In a statement, a Chevron spokesman said the company was ""pleased"" and pegged the award at $106 million, including interest.Chevron continues to fight claims from the Ecuadorean villagers, who have filed lawsuits in Canada, Brazil and Argentina seeking to enforce a $9 billion judgment rendered in Ecuador against Chevron. In March 2014, a U.S. judge in New York issued a scathing ruling finding that the villagers' American lawyer, Steven Donziger, committed fraud in securing that judgment.Donziger, who denies any wrongdoing, has appealed.

303,"   By Joseph Ax  A U.S. appeals court on Tuesday rejected Ecuador's challenge to a $96 million international arbitration award in favor of energy giant Chevron Corp, marking the latest twist in a decades-long dispute over the development of oil fields in the South American country.The dispute stemmed from a 1973 deal that called for Texaco Petroleum Co, later acquired by Chevron, to develop oil fields in exchange for selling oil to the Ecuadorean government at below-market rates. Texaco filed several lawsuits in the 1990s accusing Ecuador of violating the contract.The District of Columbia U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a 2011 award from The Hague's Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Netherlands.Calls for comment to a lawyer for Ecuador and the Ecuadorean embassy in Washington were not immediately returned. The decision is not part of a separate legal battle brought by a group of Ecuadorean villagers who claim Texaco caused billions of dollars in pollution damage when it began exploring oil deposits in the 1960s.In the case at hand, Chevron initiated an arbitration proceeding at The Hague in 2006, claiming the Ecuadorean courts failed to resolve the lawsuits in a timely manner, violating a treaty between Ecuador and the United States. A panel awarded Chevron $96 million, which was subsequently upheld by the Dutch court system. Chevron then filed a federal lawsuit in Washington, seeking a judgment confirming the panel's decision in order to collect the award.

308,"   By Clyde Russell | LAUNCESTON, Australia,  LAUNCESTON, Australia,  Want a snapshot of the problems facing natural resource companies and why the era of big projects is over? Consider the recent dilemmas of Chevron, Adani and Fortescue Metals in Australia.The first is battling cost overruns and combative unions in trying to get a multi-billion dollar project ready.The second is facing yet another delay to the world's biggest coal-mining development, with a court victory by environmentalists adding to financing challenges amid deteriorating economics.The third is playing coy about a possible rescue by a Chinese white knight, which could help it survive a severe downturn in the price of its product, largely self-inflicted by overly ambitious expansions within the industry.The three companies have little in common other than they all operate in Australia and face the challenge of trying to successfully run major projects at a time of unrelenting commodity price weakness.But each in their own way highlights why companies are going to be increasingly reluctant to take on significant commodity projects, a trend likely to last for some time, possibly well into the next up cycle in prices.While the three examples are all based in Australia, the issues are common to most resource projects in other developed countries, such as Canada, and even in developing nations like Mozambique and Indonesia.NO NEW PROJECTS WITHOUT LABOR CHANGES Chevron is facing a strike by workers at its Gorgon liquefied natural gas (LNG) project, just as the $54 billion development nears completion.The Australian Manufacturing Workers Union is backing its members to strike for an improvement to rosters, which would see the number of workdays cut and the number of days off increased, according to the Australian Financial Review on Aug. 4.The workers are already among Australia's highest paid, with the newspaper saying they earned an average of A$200,000 ($146,000) a year for their part in building the 15.6 million-tonne-a-year LNG project on a remote island off the northwest Australian coast.Any strike action may push first cargoes from the already delayed and over-budget project from later this year into 2016.    Chevron has said little publicly on the latest labor dispute at Gorgon, with the newspaper saying the issue was one to be worked out between the company's contractors and the union. However, the disquiet among the companies currently building seven LNG projects in Australia is palpable, with one executive of an oil major saying privately his company would never again build in Australia without major changes to labor laws.This would include life-of-project agreements that would set out terms and conditions for the entire construction phase, he said, rather than just for the current maximum four years.The companies believe the shorter agreements have allowed unions to hold them to ransom by making excessive demands once a project is half complete.While unions can be expected to push for the best conditions for their members, it seems self-defeating for them to make new projects so unattractive that they will remain undeveloped.REPTILES AND REEFS If Chevron is having difficulty getting its project across the finish line, India's Adani is struggling to get its $16 billion Carmichael coal venture to the starting block. In the latest setback, the Australian Federal Court ruled the environmental approval for the mine in outback Queensland failed to include conditions to protect two vulnerable reptiles, the yakka skink and the ornamental snake.Environmentalists lauded the decision as a blow against the mine, which they believe should be scrapped on the grounds it threatens land-based species and the Great Barrier Reef, and because the coal would release greenhouse gases when burned.However, Adani said the ruling only showed a ""technical legal error"" and was confident the matter would be rectified.Environment Minister Greg Hunt can still approve the mine and his department said it will take six to eight weeks to look at an assessment of the project's impact on the two species.Even if the mine is approved, it's by no means certain to go ahead, with Adani battling to secure financing and recently stopping pre-construction and engineering work.Weak prices and uncertainty over whether the coal will actually be needed are more likely to lead to the mine being canceled, but environmental activists are also betting that the more difficult they make it for Adani, the more likely the Indian group will cut their losses and walk away. IRON ORE'S LOW RETURNS Fortescue Metals Group has at least got its major iron ore mine and associated rail and port infrastructure in place and operating, but it too faces the challenge of low prices and uncertain demand.Shares in Fortescue jumped as much as 10 percent in Wednesday's trade after a Bloomberg report that China's Hebei Iron & Steel Group and Tewoo Group could invest in its infrastructure and mining assets.Fortescue said in a statement that while there is no agreement with any party at this time, it remains open to discussions about selling stakes in its business.Fortescue shares are now worth slightly more than a quarter of their 2011 peak, mirroring the decline in spot iron ore prices over the same period.The problem for the world's fourth-biggest iron ore exporter is that it funded its rapid growth with debt, and is now in a weakened position because of the collapse in iron ore prices.While a white knight may help it weather the storm, a rescue won't remove Fortescue - or other iron ore producers - from a market that is massively over-supplied and has little short- to medium-term prospects of a demand-led rebound.While Chevron, Adani and Fortescue all face low prices and over-supplied markets, these alone won't be enough to dissuade the companies of the value of their projects.It's likely the other factors, namely the cost of labor, regulatory hurdles, environmental activism and financing difficulties, that will make future projects on the scale of what these three are undertaking unlikely to proceed.--Clyde Russell is a Reuters columnist.

Majors ExxonMobil and BP have both handed back exploration blocks this year to Indonesia, and Swedish independent Lundin Petroleum has said it is exiting the country.ConocoPhillips has proposed to upstream oil and gas regulator SKKMigas to open its data room for its holding in South Natuna Sea Block B, the agency's spokesman Elan Biantoro told Reuters. Such requests were usually made by companies ""that want to farm out their participating interests,"" he noted.ConocoPhillips was opening the data room to offer its share to other investors, company spokesman Joang Laksanto confirmed.

324,"  NEW YORK Chevron Corp (CVX.N) is cutting staff on its global energy trading desks this week, sources said on Thursday, making it the latest division to face reductions as part of a $3 billion cost-saving plan brought on by low crude oil prices.The Supply and Trading group, based in Houston, but with offices in Singapore, London and San Ramon, California, may be reduced by as much as 10 percent as part of a company-wide job reduction plan, according to two people familiar with the measures. Six other sources said they were aware of the cuts but could not say how deep they might be.While staff cutbacks are now commonplace across the energy industry as companies adjust to oil prices of $50 a barrel, half what they were a year ago, Chevron's moves this week appeared to be some of the largest to affect trading operations. Some companies have sought to protect the trading desks to help navigate choppy markets.The company declined to comment on the scale of the cuts or who was affected but said it was ""taking action to reduce internal costs in multiple operating units and the corporate center"" because of market conditions. It said in July that it would lay off 1,500 employees globally, about 2 percent of its workforce, with about two-thirds of those in Texas. Chevron's workforce reduction process required some employees to re-apply for their current roles or for newly created streamlined roles, two people said. As the second-largest U.S. energy producer, Chevron runs one of the industry's bigger global trading operations, one with a greater appetite for risk than conservative rival ExxonMobil (XOM.N) - which has long shunned any proprietary dealing. But the desk takes fewer risks than European rivals such as  BP (BP.L) and Total (TOTF.PA). The S&T group handles an average of 5 million barrels per day (bpd) of ""liquids,"" essentially crude and oil products, according to its website, equivalent to 8 percent of daily global oil supply. It also trades 6 billion cubic feet a day of natural gas, equal to about 7 percent of U.S. daily supply.  One former employee estimated the global crude and oil products desks had an estimated 100 front-line traders, though Chevron declined to break out how many staff worked in the division.

329,"   By Ernest Scheyder  Chevron Corp (CVX.N) is slashing 10 percent of its workforce and sharply paring back its budget, with Chief Executive Officer John Watson giving a downbeat view on Friday of an industry beleaguered by low oil prices.A more than 55 percent decline in crude oil CLc1 since last year has rippled through the global energy industry, forcing producers and their suppliers to make tough decisions. For Chevron, that means cutting its budget by 25 percent next year by spending less in Australia, Angola and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, where the No. 2 U.S. oil company has major growth projects.""We need to be more efficient at what we do,"" Watson said on a conference call with analysts and investors. While he said prices should rise eventually, he is ""sober about the current realities of lower prices"" for the next few years.    The news came as Chevron also reported a sharp drop in third-quarter earnings that still beat Wall Street's expectations due to cost cuts and strong refining margins.The company's pain was all the more stark given that larger rival Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) not only posted stronger-than-expected results on Friday but also had not announced any massive layoffs.Chevron plans to spend $25 billion to $28 billion next year and expects to further slash spending in 2017 and 2018, an acknowledgment that it does not expect oil prices to rebound soon. The San Ramon, California-based company also said it would lay off 6,000 to 7,000 workers.Under pressure from Wall Street, Watson committed to keeping Chevron's dividend, now at $1.07 a share. ""Our first priority is to maintain the dividend and grow it as a pattern of earnings and cash flow permit,"" he said.GROWTH PROJECTS The company is spending more than $20 billion on five new projects it hopes will boost production 20 percent by 2017. Two of them, the Gorgon and Wheatstone liquefied natural gas facilities in Australia, should open next year, Watson said. Such a step would help reduce construction costs and alleviate concern on Wall Street, where analysts have grown anxious about overspending. ""We're going to see disproportionately strong growth through 2017, frankly into 2018,"" Watson said.Yet he said Chevron would ""pace"" the timeline for the other large LNG projects, in western Canada and Angola. In the Gulf of Mexico, the Big Foot deepwater oil project is now not expected to produce any oil at least through 2017, Watson said. Big Foot, which was slated to be online this year, had a major setback last summer with the sinking of at least nine giant tendons, designed to connect the platform to the sea floor.        RESULTS Chevron reported net income of $2.04 billion, or $1.09 per share, compared with $5.59 billion, or $2.95 per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average were expecting 76 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Production fell 1 percent to 2.5 million barrels of oil equivalent per day.Profit at the downstream unit, which is smaller than the oil-producing part of the company and which makes gasoline, lubricant and other refined products, jumped 49 percent. Refiners tend to be more profitable when oil prices are low. Chevron cut operating and administrative expenses by 7 percent during the quarter, but it was not enough to fully offset the price drop.Shares of Chevron were up 1.9 percent at $91.54 in afternoon trading.

333,"  (Adds conference call quotes, details on megaprojects, updates stock)By Ernest ScheyderOct 30 Chevron Corp is slashing 10 percent of its workforce and sharply paring back its budget, with Chief Executive Officer John Watson giving a downbeat view on Friday of an industry beleaguered by low oil prices.A more than 55 percent decline in crude oil since last year has rippled through the global energy industry, forcing producers and their suppliers to make tough decisions.For Chevron, that means cutting its budget by 25 percent next year by spending less in Australia, Angola and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, where the No. 2 U.S. oil company has major growth projects.""We need to be more efficient at what we do,"" Watson said on a conference call with analysts and investors. While he said prices should rise eventually, he is ""sober about the current realities of lower prices"" for the next few years.The news came as Chevron also reported a sharp drop in third-quarter earnings that still beat Wall Street's expectations due to cost cuts and strong refining margins.The company's pain was all the more stark given that larger rival Exxon Mobil Corp not only posted stronger-than-expected results on Friday but also had not announced any massive layoffs.Chevron plans to spend $25 billion to $28 billion next year and expects to further slash spending in 2017 and 2018, an acknowledgment that it does not expect oil prices to rebound soon. The San Ramon, California-based company also said it would lay off 6,000 to 7,000 workers.Under pressure from Wall Street, Watson committed to keeping Chevron's dividend, now at $1.07 a share.""Our first priority is to maintain the dividend and grow it as a pattern of earnings and cash flow permit,"" he said.GROWTH PROJECTS  The company is spending more than $20 billion on five new projects it hopes will boost production 20 percent by 2017.Two of them, the Gorgon and Wheatstone liquefied natural gas facilities in Australia, should open next year, Watson said. Such a step would help reduce construction costs and alleviate concern on Wall Street, where analysts have grown anxious about overspending.""We're going to see disproportionately strong growth through 2017, frankly into 2018,"" Watson said.Yet he said Chevron would ""pace"" the timeline for the other large LNG projects, in western Canada and Angola. In the Gulf of Mexico, the Big Foot deepwater oil project is now not expected to produce any oil at least through 2017, Watson said. Big Foot, which was slated to be online this year, had a major setback last summer with the sinking of at least nine giant tendons, designed to connect the platform to the sea floor.RESULTS Chevron reported net income of $2.04 billion, or $1.09 per share, compared with $5.59 billion, or $2.95 per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average were expecting 76 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Production fell 1 percent to 2.5 million barrels of oil equivalent per day.Profit at the downstream unit, which is smaller than the oil-producing part of the company and which makes gasoline, lubricant and other refined products, jumped 49 percent. Refiners tend to be more profitable when oil prices are low.Chevron cut operating and administrative expenses by 7 percent during the quarter, but it was not enough to fully offset the price drop.Shares of Chevron were up 1.9 percent at $91.54 in afternoon trading.

344,"   By Richard Valdmanis | BOSTON  BOSTON Dec 1 Several of the world's biggest climate-focused mutual funds have stakes in traditional oil and gas companies mixed in with their solar, wind and clean tech holdings, a potential shock to green investors seeking to avoid fossil fuels altogether.Six of the 20 biggest funds that mention ""climate change"" or ""global warming"" in their titles or marketing materials have oil and gas stocks, including two funds with investments in companies proposing new pipelines from Canada's carbon-intensive oil sands reserves, according to Reuters data.""This really underscores that prospective investors should carefully read a fund's details and not just its label,"" said Meg Voorhes, head of research at the Forum for Sustainable and Responsible Investment in Washington, D.C.Investing in climate risk is an important theme as world leaders gather in Paris to hash out an agreement to rein in global warming. Climate funds are a relatively new tool for environmentally minded investors, and remain a tiny part of the $30 trillion-plus mutual fund universe. ( tmsnrt.rs/1l5i4YJ  )AVOIDANCE VERSUS ENCOURAGEMENT A climate fund offered to European investors by HSBC, the HSBC GIF Global Equity Climate Change fund, holds stock in U.S. oil producer and refiner Chevron Corp, South African energy company SASOL Ltd and British oil and gas producer BG Group Plc.All three companies are large carbon emitters but have launched efforts in recent years to mitigate or cut their emissions impact under pressure from environmental groups and politicians seeking to counter the risks of climate change.""It is not so much about avoiding companies that are carbon emitters, but about investing in companies that have sought to adapt their businesses to meet the challenge,"" said HSBC spokesman Charles Clarke of the fund's holdings. A prospectus for HSBC fund says it invests in ""companies that aim to be the market-leaders in their respective sectors at managing their businesses in the face of climate change.""Deutsche Bank's $75 million Global Warming Prevention Equity Fund offered to Asian investors - the second biggest climate-focused fund in the field - held stock this year in U.S. oil and gas driller Helmerich and Payne Inc, according to fund disclosures.A Deutsche Bank spokeswoman on Tuesday cited the drilling company's focus on natural gas, which burns cleaner than oil or coal, and its hydraulic fracturing or fracking technology, which had increased its productivity. She added the fund had since sold off the stock.The fund had also previously owned large stakes in oil companies Noble Energy and pipeline company Kinder Morgan Inc, according to disclosures. SYMBOLIC ENEMY Nomura's $13.5 million Nomura Global Climate Change Fund, launched in 2007 and ranked 16th-largest in the field, was among the most heavily invested in oil and gas at about 5.8 percent of its portfolio. Among the stock's holdings was a small stake in TransCanada Corp.TransCanada became a symbolic enemy of the U.S. green movement in recent years over worries its Keystone project would have led to an increase in oil sands production. The project was rejected by the Obama administration on Nov. 6 on environmental grounds after a prolonged review.A spokesman for Nomura said the fund was small and available only to investors in Taiwan. He did not respond to requests for comment about the fund's holdings. Nomura's fund also held stock in Australia's top oil and gas producer, Woodside Petroleum Ltd, and Norway's Statoil .Another Taiwan-based fund, the Jih Sun Anti-Global Warming Fund, held a small stake in Enbridge Inc, a Canadian company that has proposed an oil sands pipeline to Canada's West Coast, a potential Plan B to the failed Keystone XL project.The best performers in the climate fund field so far this year were portfolios that avoided fossil fuels entirely. A global glut in oil and gas supplies has crushed prices since late 2014 and in turn the share prices of producers.They include Schroder's $196 million ISF Glo Climate Change Equity fund, which was up 13.7 percent, and the $11.1 million Jupiter JGF Global Ecology Growth fund, which was up 10.8 percent - eye-popping returns in a lackluster overall market.A spokeswoman for Schroder did not comment.Among the biggest holdings in the five largest climate-focused portfolios as measured by assets under management were U.S. design and manufacturing firm Danaher Corp , U.S. wind energy and aerospace materials maker Hexcel Corp, and wind and solar power company NextEra Energy Inc.U.S. investment company Etho Capital launched one of the few climate-focused funds available in the United States earlier this year, the Etho Climate Leadership exchange-traded fund. The fund holds no oil or gas stocks and tracks the performance of some 400 U.S. companies ""that are leaders in their industry with respect to their climate impact.""That fund is up 14 percent since its launch.(Editing by Matthew Lewis)",2015-12-01,CVX,"Tue Dec 1, 2015 | 11:19am EST",Green investors take note: climate-focused mutual funds dabble in oil,http://www.reuters.com//article/climatechange-summit-investing-idUSL8N13M42J20151201?type=companyNews

""This is an important step in the commercialisation of Chevron's natural gas holdings in Australia,"" Pierre Breber, executive vice president of Chevron Gas and Midstream, said in a statement.Chevron in January signed a contract with South Korea's SK LNG Trading Pte Ltd to supply 4.15 million tonnes of LNG from Australia over a five years starting in 2017.

The East Kalimantan block currently supplies up to 70 million standard cubic feet per day (mmscfd) of gas to Indonesia's Bontang liquefied natural gas plant and 20,000 barrels of crude per day to the Balikpapan refinery, a company spokesman told Reuters. Elan Biantoro, a spokesman for Indonesia's upstream oil and gas regulator (SKKMigas), said the government was aware of Chevron's decision to relinquish the East Kalimantan block. The government is reviewing whether to tender the block again or to hand it to state-owned energy giant, Pertamina [PERTM.UL], Biantoro said.Chevron has operated the East Kalimantan block for nearly 50 years, and its output had ""thinned"", Biantoro said. ""They were also worried about what happened in the Mahakam block,"" he said, referring to Chevron's reason for the decision.Risks energy investors face in Indonesia have been highlighted by a more than seven-year tussle over the future of the country's Mahakam block, its top gas-producing field currently operated by Total, as nationalistic elements are pushing for energy assets to be handed to Pertamina.Last year, majors ExxonMobil and BP both handed back exploration blocks to Indonesia, while Swedish independent Lundin Petroleum said it was exiting the country. According to SKKMigas, Indonesia's oil and gas companies are targeting a 2-percent decline in average daily output to 1.944 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) in 2016, from around 1.981 boepd in 2015.

Prices came under pressure on Tuesday morning as Iran ordered a sharp increase in oil output to take immediate advantage of the lifting of sanctions.""It is clear that investor sentiment is driving oil prices... Bearish bets are at their highest level since 1983, indicating heightened concerns around Iran oil flooding the market,"" ANZ bank said on Tuesday.Sanctions had cut Iran's oil exports by about 2 million bpd since their pre-sanctions 2011 peak, to little more than 1 million bpd.With the prospect of a lifting of sanctions becoming increasingly clear since the beginning of the year, a price rout that started in mid-2014 accelerated, pulling crude down over 70 percent in 18 months. U.S. crude futures were trading at $29.00 a barrel by 0105 GMT, down 42 cents from their last settlement.Front-month Brent crude futures, though up a notch just after opening Tuesday's trade, remained below $29 per barrel at $28.69 per barrel.""The run up to this weekend's announcement has likely contributed to the recent decline in oil prices,"" Goldman Sachs said. ""We have been assuming that production will rise by 285,000 barrels per day year-on-year in 2016,"" it added.Most traders expect Iran's full return to oil markets to be relatively slow due to the need to overhaul its infrastructure, which is creaking from years of under investment under the sanctions.But they also say that the initial ramp-up could be fast because of large amounts of oil Iran has stored for immediate sale. This is estimated at 12 million barrels of crude and 24 million barrels of condensates.In OPEC-member Venezuela, there are signs that state-owned producer PDVSA is in dire straits over the oil price crash as it has requested partners to pay for naphtha imported to produce exportable crudes.PDVSA is responsible for providing the naphtha, or light crude, needed to dilute the extra heavy oil produced at the Orinoco Belt, according to contracts signed with foreign partners including Chevron, Spain's Repsol and India's ONGC.In other oil news, Japan's Cosmo Oil ordered a U.S. crude cargo, the first purchase by a Japanese buyer since the ending of a four-decade ban on most U.S. crude exports.

375,"   By Oleg Vukmanovic  Feb 1 Chevron Corp is sweetening its sales pitch to attract new buyers to the under-booked $54 billion Gorgon liquefied natural gas export plant off northwest Australia, hit by high costs as fuel prices and demand plunge.The move is a departure for Chevron which has for years stuck to its ambitious asking prices, industry sources say, only yielding as global liquefied natural gas (LNG) demand slumped and new supply gave buyers cheaper alternatives.Production at the giant 15.6 million-tonnes-a-year plant is due to begin within weeks.""Lousy"" is how Chevron Chief Executive Officer John Watson last week described the global LNG market which Gorgon - the world's most expensive such venture - will sell into.Chevron faces a unique double-blow from record growth in gas supplies from Australia and the United States and from battered crude oil markets pushing current LNG prices below Gorgon's high cost of production, according to analysts. And a scarcity of customers leaves Chevron on the hook for a quarter of its share of Gorgon's unsold volume this decade, leaving it few options but to dump supplies onto already depressed spot markets, industry sources said.Instead, Chevron needs more long-term buyers paying oil-linked prices, such as its five existing Japanese clients, to help guarantee earnings over the project's 40-year lifespan. Since December the U.S. firm has lined up two preliminary deals with Chinese buyers ENN and Huadian Green Energy Co for Gorgon LNG over a 10-year period, starting in 2019 and 2020, respectively.""New agreements with Chinese customers ... are important steps in the commercialization of Chevron's equity natural gas holdings in Australia, demonstrating the project's competitiveness,"" a Chevron spokesman said on Monday.The price of the deals, on which Chevron declined comment, are estimated at 12.2-12.3 percent of crude oil, plus a small fixed fee and a floor price, two industry sources said. That compares with higher prices paid by Chevron's Japanese clients at 14.85 percent of oil for 25 years of supply, sources say.While contract differences between Japanese and Chinese deals make direct comparisons tricky, a long-term LNG contract negotiator said lower prices offered to China may open the door to price reviews between Chevron and its Japanese clients down the line.But even if the latest batch of deals puts Chevron's Gorgon scheme on surer footing for 2020-2030 traders still see its unsold volumes sailing into distressed spot markets this decade.""We're going to go through a challenging period for any volumes that will be sold spot into the marketplace,"" Watson said in a teleconference call with analysts last week.

376,"   By Ron Bousso | LONDON  LONDON Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) on Monday sealed the $53 billion (36 billion pounds) acquisition of British rival BG Group to form the world's top liquefied natural gas company, even as slumping oil prices cast a shadow on the upcoming years of transition.The success or otherwise of the complex merger will define the legacy of Shell Chief Executive Ben van Beurden, seeking to transform Shell into a more specialized group focused on the rapidly growing LNG market and deepwater oil production. ""We will now be able to shape a simpler, leaner, more competitive company, focusing on our core expertise in deep water and LNG,"" van Beurden said in a statement. In 2014, Shell acquired Repsol's (REP.MC) LNG business. Van Beurden's vision won overwhelming support from shareholders, though a number of major investors had voiced concerns that the forecast slow recovery in oil prices would strain Shell's financials and risk its growth plans.The deal, announced 10 months ago, creates a combined group which will leapfrog Chevron (CVX.N) to become the world's second-largest public oil and gas company by market value behind Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N).BG shareholders largely opted to receive shares rather than cash under the proposed mix and match deal, according to a statement. BG becomes a wholly-owned subsidiary of Shell and will be headed by Dutchman Huibert Vigeveno, who has headed the integration planning team and will oversee its implementation. SPECTACULAR GROWTH  Signs at BG's headquarters in Reading outside London were replaced by Shell's red-and-orange logo over the weekend, according to company sources.  Incumbent CEO Helge Lund, former head of Norwegian oil major Statoil (STL.OL) who led it through a period of spectacular growth, is set to step down and has yet to indicate his plans.Shell has said it will cut thousands of jobs from the combined group and sell $30 billion of assets over the next three years in order to finance the deal, buy back shares and support dividends, which it has vowed to maintain or increase.Shell is betting heavily on a rapid growth in the global LNG market over coming decades as the world turns to less polluting sources of energy. Yet with oil prices near a 12-year low, a struggling global economy and major restructuring under way of its oil and gas operations across the globe, the merger is set to be a challenge even for 126-year-old Anglo-Dutch company. Shell saw its income drop 87 percent in 2015.""The financials will work in time, admittedly perhaps not as originally hoped, but we still see this deal as accretive within a two- to three-year timeframe,"" said Jason Kenney, analyst at Grupo Santander, who estimates the acquisition will increase Shell's oil and gas production to around 4.7 million barrels of oil equivalent by 2020.""The deal means Shell will have little need to explore near or medium term, or to invest in highly capital-intensive unconventional projects,"" Kenney added.  (Additional reporting by Karolin Schaps; Editing by David Holmes)",2016-02-15,CVX,"Mon Feb 15, 2016 | 2:17pm EST",Shell pursues transition plan after sealing $53 bln BG deal,http://www.reuters.com//article/bg-ma-shell-idUSL8N15R388?type=companyNews
377,"  (Updates to reflect delays to Gorgon, Wheatstone, Ichthys)     Feb 25 Australia has more than $180 billion of liquefied natural gas export projects coming online, with developers planning to add about 53 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of LNG production by 2017, an increase that would make the country the world's top LNG exporter.

Both companies, however, have curtailed share buybacks. Chevron Chief Financial Officer Pat Yarrington said on Tuesday the company has no plans to resume repurchases. Chevron is paying its dividend partially with debt. While executives had outlined a plan last fall to cover the dividend with cash flow by next year, that requires oil prices CLc1 at $50 per barrel, roughly $12 per barrel below current levels. Chevron plans to spend to between $17 billion to $22 billion annually in 2017 and 2018. For 2016, the company has already announced it would spend $26.6 billion. Part of the spending reduction will come as construction projects are finished around the world, including major liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects in Australia and Angola, as well as oil projects in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.Chevron said on Monday it had started producing LNG at its Gorgon facility in western Australia and would begin shipping next week, a major milestone for a long-delayed and over-budget project.

381,"   By Ernest Scheyder | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Chevron Corp (CVX.N) will add two drilling rigs to the oil-rich Permian shale of West Texas in 2016, part of a bet that crude prices CLc1 will rise this year from near 10-year lows. The spending increase - under which Chevron plans to run seven Permian rigs, up from five now - comes even as the company and its peers slash spending but aim to keep low-cost, high-return areas viable in case oil prices rebound.    ""We don't really expect to see below $40 (per barrel oil prices) on an extended basis,"" Jay Johnson, Chevron's head of upstream projects, said on Tuesday in his first interview since assuming the No. 2 role at the company last June. ""So few things work in the world below $40 that it's hard to see how you'd maintain the energy supply.""Chevron believes it can profitably drill 1,300 Permian wells with oil prices below $40 per barrel, and 4,000 profitable Permian wells with prices below $50.Part of Johnson's confidence in the Permian comes from Chevron's massive position there: the company controls more than 2 million acres estimated to contain 9 billion barrels of oil equivalent. Nearly all of that supply, enough to sate global need for more than 100 days, is royalty-free, further boosting margins. John Watson, Chevron's chief executive, told reporters earlier on Tuesday that some Permian wells could even be profitable below $30 per barrel.""We're drilling today in anticipation of what prices might be,"" Watson said. The forecast does not hold true for Chevron's natural gas developments in Pennsylvania's Marcellus shale, which has been battered by low prices.""Unlike oil, I think gas (prices) will stay low in the United States for some time,"" Johnson said. ""We're going to have to be able to figure out how to make money at a low gas price.""Chevron on Tuesday morning held its annual analyst day, with Johnson, Watson and other executives vowing to protect the company's 90-year-old dividend and touting expansion projects in Australia, the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and elsewhere. In the interview, Johnson stressed that Chevron learned lessons last year when nine tendons designed to link the Big Foot deepwater oil project to the U.S. Gulf seabed, sank, delaying production until 2018.The tendons have been retrieved and many of the damaged parts can be reused, Johnson said.""All we need to do is re-manufacture the tendons that failed,"" he said.

387,"   By Tim McLaughlin and Luc Cohen | OKLAHOMA CITY  OKLAHOMA CITY Nearly 15 years since Enron’s collapse decimated the retirement accounts of its employees, hundreds of thousands of U.S. energy workers remain precariously exposed to big, concentrated bets on company stock in their 401(k) retirement plans.The slide in oil prices to their lowest levels in over a decade wiped out several billion dollars of retirement wealth in the energy sector in the past year. The losses may prove temporary for companies that successfully navigate the crisis, but tens of thousands of employees of struggling firms may see much of their nest eggs gone for good.In Oklahoma and Texas, workers are delaying retirement plans, surrendering trucks, cars and land in personal bankruptcy cases, or just praying oil prices will recover.""I just didn't see it coming,"" said John Thompson, 57, who was laid off in February from Oklahoma City-based SandRidge Energy Inc SDOC.PK. SandRidge shares, which peaked above $65 in 2008, are now worth 10 cents apiece. ""Because of this, I'm not retiring any time soon.""SandRidge did not return messages seeking comment.Almost without exception energy company 401(k) plans offered at least 10 different investment alternatives to company stock, their plans show.Yet company reports and interviews with more than 20 current and former employees at independent energy firms show many employees have not taken advantage of opportunities to switch out of company shares. Maureen Nelson, who retired from Chesapeake Energy Corp (CHK.N) in 2013, said she lost an estimated $100,000 as she watched the company's shares plunge in value.Inertia and a strong faith in company leadership played a role in holding on to company stock, but so did company policies.Many energy firms continued to match employee contributions with company stock, even as most large U.S. companies stopped the practice after the Enron debacle, according to several corporate benefits consultants.The energy industry followed the lead of heavyweights such as Chevron Corp (CVX.N) and Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N), which for years provided matching contributions in company stock in worker 401(k) retirement plans while also funding separate defined benefit pension plans for them.DOUBLE IMPACT Smaller companies could not afford to do both, but they typically matched employee contributions in stock. And energy workers often plowed some or most of their own contributions into company stock, benefits consultants said.  ""It's not prudent investing,"" said Lou Harvey, chief executive of Boston-based financial research firm Dalbar Inc. “But employees tend to clamor for company stock.”Typically, workers at larger energy companies would have 20 percent to 60 percent of 401(k) assets in company stock, according to a Reuters analysis of such holdings for more than 400,000 employees.By contrast, the average U.S. 401(k) plan has about 7 percent of assets in company stock, according to Washington D.C.-based Investment Company Institute.At Chevron, more than 40,000 participants in its 401(k) plan held $8.9 billion, or 47 percent of investment assets, in company stock at the end of 2014, according to the latest annual report. (Graphic:tmsnrt.rs/1RwkqYB)Chevron stopped matching in company stock last year for better diversification, spokeswoman Melissa Ritchie said. Exxon stopped new stock contributions after 2006. Its shares still accounted for $12.9 billion of the 401(k) plan's $22.3 billion in assets in 2014. Exxon declined comment.When Texas-based Enron filed for bankruptcy in 2001, employees suffered a one-two punch - they lost their jobs and much of their savings because nearly two-thirds of their retirement assets were in Enron stock.After Enron's collapse, companies successfully lobbied Congress mostly against proposals to limit company stock ownership in 401(k) plans, fearing billions of dollars of their shares would be offloaded to meet the caps. “Caps were a bridge too far for companies,” said Sheila Bair, former chair of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and a U.S. Treasury official who worked on President George W. Bush’s 2002 task force on retirement security.Still, publicly-traded companies have revamped their retirement plans to make them more balanced, even imposing own limits on company stock ownership, said Rob Austin, director of retirement research at Aon Hewitt.FOLLOW THE LEADER Diversification has yet to reach much of the energy sector, though. Oil and gas workers had more than $32 billion in company stock in their 401(k) accounts, or about 38 percent of plan assets for the 40 companies in the S&P 500 Energy Sector Index, according to 2014 annual reports filed with the U.S. Department of Labor. Since then, the index has lost 21 percent. Smaller independents have been hit about twice as hard, on average.With about a third of his 401(k) plan in company stock, retired Chesapeake geologist Keith Rasmussen, 61, looks to sell land he owns in Oklahoma and Idaho to shore up his depleted retirement funds. Chesapeake, once a shale boom darling, now trades 84 percent below mid-2014 levels, hurt by heavy debt and prolonged slump in natural gas prices. Nearly 8,000 participants in its 401(k) are exposed to the reversal of fortune, holding 35 percent of the plan’s $615 million in assets in company stock at the end of 2014, according to the latest annual report. Some current and former Chesapeake employees said their decisions to hold onto stock were based partly on their reverence for Aubrey McClendon, its legendary former chief executive, who died in a car crash in early March ""You could be the biggest skeptic in the world, and you listen to him in a room for 30 minutes, and you're ready to hand him all your money,"" said Ginni Kennedy, 58, who retired from her engineering job at Chesapeake in 2013. ""I had faith that he'd continue to be able to pull those rabbits out of his hat.""Chesapeake, which declined to comment, stopped matching in company stock last year.Many workers are now paying a heavy price for failing to heed warnings about concentration risk.“Our bankruptcy work has quadrupled over the past six months,” said Roger Ediger, an Enid, Oklahoma lawyer who handles personal bankruptcy cases. “Most of them are energy related.”A U.S. Supreme Court decision in 2014 underscored the risk of offering company shares in 401(k) plans. Its decision made clear that company stock was not automatically a prudent investment.The ruling also highlighted the potential conflicts of interest for companies in their role as fiduciary of 401(k) plans. “It was a wake-up call to companies,” said Bill Ryan, chief fiduciary officer at Evercore Trust, the largest U.S. third-party fiduciary.At Fort Worth, Texas-based Quicksilver Resources Inc KWKAQ.PK, Evercore Trust took a rare step to block further employee investment in the company’s 401(k) plan in October 2014, as fiduciary for the stock plan. The move preserved some value, but not much, given that by the time the stock fund was liquidated company shares have already fallen to about 50 cents from about $3.50 in 2014. Equity investors lost virtually everything five months later when Quicksilver filed for bankruptcy protection.Bair, now a college president, said companies with heavy stock concentrations in their 401(k)s should follow peers that have caps in place to protect workers and avoid government mandates.“If we have another failure like Enron, government regulation may be coming.”     (Reporting By Tim McLaughlin and Luc Cohen; Editing by Tomasz Janowski)",2016-03-22,CVX,"Wed Mar 23, 2016 | 6:15am EDT",INSIGHT-Ride to the Bottom: US energy workers hit hard by company stock bets,http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-energy-retirement-idUSL2N16A1GW?type=companyNews
388,"   By Clyde Russell   (The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.)By Clyde RussellLAUNCESTON, Australia - The falling dominoes that are major liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects show that the industry needs a re-think on how it is structured and operates.Up until now LNG has largely been about massive and costly projects undertaken by international majors on the basis that the billions of dollars being invested is guaranteed to make a good return because of long-term sales contracts to utilities.But the scrapping of Woodside Petroleum's Browse floating LNG project off the coast of Western Australian state goes a long way to confirm that the model that has so far underpinned the development of the industry is no longer viable.Woodside, which operates Australia's giant Northwest Shelf project as well as its own Pluto facility, is no newcomer to LNG, and it's telling that it couldn't envisage a way to make the $30-billion Browse project profitable in the current environment.Woodside's partner in Browse, energy major Royal Dutch Shell, had previously flagged that the project would only work if it could be profitable at an oil price of less $50 a barrel. Given Brent crude is currently around $40, it seems the price hurdle was probably too great for Browse.But so was the lack of customers keen to sign up to long-term, oil-linked contracts, something acknowledged by Woodside Chief Executive Peter Coleman.Asian buyers now hold the whip hand in LNG pricing, given the rapid growth in supply from new projects in Australia, five of which have started in the past two years and three more planned to start by 2017.In addition, the United States has exported its first LNG through the Sabine Pass facility and has four more projects currently under construction.The problem is that all these new projects have altered the supply-demand balance to the point where it's hard to see the market being able to absorb all the available LNG, even if prices continue to slump.Asian spot LNG was at $4.50 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) last week, close to the record low of $4.30 reached earlier this month and less than a quarter of the peak of $20.50 reached in February 2014. It's not only the new supply that has driven prices lower, demand has been softer than expected, with Japan's imports dropping for a sixth consecutive month in February, in what may well be confirmation of a structural decline in the world's biggest buyer of the super-cooled fuel.China, the big hope for LNG demand growth, has imported 14.3 percent more in the first two months of 2016 than it did for the same period last year, but it's worth noting that imports actually fell 1 percent last year.The spike in LNG purchases so far this year is most likely related to increased use of natural gas for heating, and this may not be sustained as winter comes to an end.However, overall China should still be a growth story for natural gas, given the authorities' determination to rely less on polluting coal.There is also the potential for greater LNG imports across Southeast Asia, with more countries planning to use the fuel, including Bangladesh, Myanmar, Vietnam and the Philippines. Traditional exporters Indonesia and Malaysia may well end up as net importers as well, given the depletion of their domestic natural gas fields and rising demand at home.But even if demand can rise to meet existing and under construction supply, this doesn't necessarily support the development of a raft of proposed projects.DOWNSTREAM KEY TO FUTURE PROJECTS There are proposals for new ventures in Australia, Canada, the United States, Russia and Mozambique, to name just a few.While some of these aim to be floating LNG platforms and some more conventional onshore plants, one thing they all have in common is that they will cost billions of dollars each. It's very hard to see multi-billion dollar projects moving to final investment decisions if long-term customers aren't signed up.What this means is that if any of these planned ventures are to see the light of day, their proponents will have to do more than build them in the hope that buyers will come.The industry needs to consider going downstream in order to ensure its long-term viability.Much like oil companies' move from producing oil into refining it and then retailing fuels, so too will LNG companies have to find ways to establish a sustainable market that will create and maintain demand for their product.This means investing in re-gasification terminals in developing nations, along with associated pipeline infrastructure and storages.It may also mean building gas-fired power plants, transmission grids and or even partnering with companies at the retail level to install gas-powered heating systems in buildings and residences.It may be too much to expect companies such as Woodside, Shell, Chevron and Exxon Mobil to do this on their own in fairly challenging markets, such as those in Asia or Africa.But they should be considering how best to partner with local companies in these countries to build out a network that could create sufficient LNG demand to once again justify the building of vastly expensive liquefaction projects.

391,"  * Maersk to shut Tyra field if no viable solution found this year* The move adds pressure on Danish govt to adjust taxes* Govt aims to find a solution as soon as possible -minister   (Adds comment from Energy Minister, background)By Teis Jensen and Erik MatzenCOPENHAGEN, April 4 The Danish government said it would try to find an economically viable solution for gas production in Denmark's part of the North Sea, after A.P. Moller-Maersk threatened on Monday to shut down the country's main gas field.Maersk's oil subsidiary said it will shut the Tyra gas field in October 2018 if it cannot find a solution by the end of this year to make the ageing site profitable in the long term.Its threat added pressure on the government from energy companies to adjust taxes on oil and gas production. They say the slump in oil prices means investing to extract the remainder of the country's declining reserves is no longer profitable. The Tyra complex produces around two thirds of Denmark's gas, according to Maersk Oil. But the company said the field was approaching the end of its operational life after more than 30 years of production and due to subsidence of the underground chalk reservoir.""The government is in a good dialogue with the industry about the future possibilities and we want to find a solution on the problems as quickly as possible,"" Energy Minister Lars Christian Lilleholt told Reuters.He said the government was still contemplating a proposal from the industry that investments in the North Sea should be eligible for a tax credit or tax postponement.The previous government increased taxes on oil and gas in 2013 so that the state now gets around 65 percent of the profits from production. ""It seems pretty obvious that if the taxes are not adjusted, then we will see a scale down,"" Sydbank analyst Jacob Pedersen said.Denmark's tax proceeds from the North Sea have fallen gradually from 36 billion Danish crowns ($5.5 bln) in 2008.In December the government said it expected tax revenues from oil and gas of just 4 billion crowns this year, but that was based on an oil price of almost $50 per barrel -- far above the current $38 level for Brent. The Tyra complex is a hub for a number of smaller facilities and more than 90 percent of Denmark's gas -- 60,000 barrels of oil equivalents last year -- is processed through the field.""We're closing down for safety reasons and not due to the oil and gas prices. But of course we look at the prices when looking at this large, long-term investment,"" the head of Maersk Oil Denmark, Martin Rune Pedersen, told Reuters.Last week Danish majority state-owned utility DONG Energy IPO-DONG.CO said it had terminated a contract to build an oil and gas platform for its Hejre field, postponing indefinitely the major development offshore Denmark.Maersk Oil has been mentioned in Danish media as a possible buyer of DONG's 60 percent stake in the Hejre project.""It makes good sense to see how one can take advantage of existing activities and installations in the area. But we must see what the Herje consortium decides on,"" Maersk Oil's Pedersen said.Maersk Oil operates Tyra on behalf of the Danish Underground Consortium (DUC) partnership, owned 31.2 percent by Maersk, 36.8 percent by Shell, 20 percent by Danish state-owned Nordsofonden and 12 percent by Chevron.

The spokesman said he could not at this stage give any details and added that ""a site team is currently assessing the situation and we should know more shortly.""Traders said that the outage of the huge facility, located on Australia's northwestern coast, could support Asian LNG prices LNG-AS which have slumped by almost 80 percent from their peak in 2014 to $4.30 per million British thermal units. Prices have plummeted as supply has soared but demand has stalled, especially in formerly booming Asia. The interruption in exports will put pressure on Chevron, whose stock price so far has fared relatively well in the slump compared with peers (see chart: tmsnrt.rs/1Xb1Aez).Investment bank Jefferies said on Monday that Chevron remains its ""top pick in the integrated oil sector"" due to rising production and an expected improvement in its cash cycles.Yet, Jefferies warned that ""the key risk to our Buy thesis over the next 12 months is project execution risk, particularly at Gorgon and Wheatstone (another LNG project in Australia).""

The ministry did not comment on the size of the claim in its statement but said the dispute was related to calculations of the parties' shares in the field's output and had been discussed in several meetings. ""There is an understanding today that the sides are determined to find a concerted solution and peacefully resolve the issue,"" it said. Eni and BG, recently acquired by Royal Dutch Shell Plc , each own 29.25 percent of the Karachaganak project in northwest Kazakhstan, which they jointly operate.

404,"   By Osamu Tsukimori | TOKYO, April 8  TOKYO, April 8 Japan's Osaka Gas Co  said this week it plans to expand its liquefied natural gas (LNG) trading activity as it adjusts to a market that has shifted from being undersupplied to a glut within the last two years.The utility said as part of the trading expansion it would try to sell LNG it does not need when it sees short-term opportunities, as well as set up long-term sales agreements with other buyers of the fuel.A surplus has emerged in global LNG production, especially in supplies from Australia, while at the same time demand from top buyers Japan, South Korea and China has stalled.Osaka Gas - which has a minority stake of 1.25 percent in Chevron's Gorgon project in Australia - has already sold long-term contract cargoes from there to Okinawa Electric Power , and may in future sell off LNG it has contracted from a project in the United States, company officials said. ""Gorgon's contract is on an FOB (free-on-board) basis, so we can market the cargoes if there are customers who are interested,"" Masayuki Inoue, Osaka Gas general manager of corporate strategy told Reuters on Thursday.""If, for example, it were very cold in winter in South Korea, we could resell the cargoes on the spot market,"" he said.With the advent of 130 million tonnes of LNG capacity in Australia and North America by 2020, producers such as Woodside Petroleum and Chevron, and buyers such as Japanese utilities, have expanded trading teams to handle excess cargo flows and navigate a more open market. The oversupply is giving buyers the upper hand with producers in demanding more flexibility, such as in allowing the resale of contracted cargoes on the spot market, and has also given traditional importers like power utilities an incentive to invest in trading desks. Osaka Gas is contracted to buy 1.38 million tonnes of LNG a year from the Gorgon project when it reaches full capacity. The gas plant, which shipped its first commercial cargo in March, was shut down early this month temporarily due to technical problems and may not restart for up to two months.Osaka Gas has commitments to take too much LNG term supplies compared with projected demand in the short to medium term, President Takehiro Honjo said separately during a Thursday luncheon with reporters, declining to give detailed figures.In Japan, the world's biggest importer of LNG, other buyers also have plenty of supplies.Osaka Gas, Japan's second-biggest city gas supplier, will also consider reselling destination-free cargoes from other projects as well, including the U.S. Freeport LNG project set to start up in 2018, Inoue said.

406,"   By Liz Hampton and Ernest Scheyder | HOUSTON  HOUSTON Chevron Corp has signed an agreement to sell its Hawaii refinery to private equity firm One Rock Capital Partners, ending a more-than six year quest to sell an asset not considered core to its business.Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but industry estimates ahead of the sale pegged its value between $75 million and $300 million. The 58,000 barrel per day refinery primarily supplies jet fuel to the U.S. military and airlines serving the Hawaiian islands. The deal, which is expected to close by December, also includes 58 gasoline stations spread throughout the archipelago and four storage terminals. While both sides declined to disclose the price, in 2013 Tesoro Corp sold Hawaii's only other refinery to Par Petroleum Inc. That $325 million deal included the plant, nearly double the Chevron refinery's size at 94,000 bpd, and a network of retail gasoline stations.       Hawaii's gasoline customers, living in one of the most-remote parts of the globe, usually pay the highest per-gallon price for gasoline. The average Hawaii gasoline price on Tuesday was $2.11 per gallon, about 23 percent above the national average, according to AAA. Transporting crude for processing to a refinery in Hawaii's islands is part of the reason costs are so much higher.One Rock said in a press release it has a ""strategic relationship"" with Mitsubishi Corp, which holds stakes in Gulf of Mexico oil wells and is involved in crude trading. The acquisition of Chevron’s downstream assets will mark the first oil refining company in One Rock Capital’s portfolio, which includes a holding company for landscape service providers, and companies that manufacturer food, chemicals and urinalysis supplies. The sale comes as Chevron plans to slash spending by nearly 40 percent for each of the next two years as it focuses more on LNG and shale oil projects around the world and also aims to preserve cash for its 90-year-old dividend. Chevron employs about 300 people in Hawaii at the refinery and product distribution terminals. It was not clear if One Rock planned to retain those employees and calls to the firm were not immediately returned.    Chevron had worked with Deutsche Bank on the sale. Chevron CEO John Watson told Wall Street in March 2015 that there was ""quite a bit of interest"" in refinery assets.Shares of California-based Chevron rose 1.8 percent on Tuesday to close at $100.50 per share, in line with the market.

The sale comes as Chevron plans to slash spending by nearly 40 percent for each of the next two years as it focuses more on LNG and shale oil projects around the world and also aims to preserve cash for its 90-year-old dividend. Chevron employs about 300 people in Hawaii at the refinery and product distribution terminals. It was not clear if One Rock planned to retain those employees and calls to the firm were not immediately returned.    Chevron had worked with Deutsche Bank on the sale. Chevron CEO John Watson told Wall Street in March 2015 that there was ""quite a bit of interest"" in refinery assets.Shares of California-based Chevron rose 1.8 percent on Tuesday to close at $100.50 per share, in line with the market.

409,"   By Denny Thomas and Anshuman Daga | HONG KONG/SINGAPORE  HONG KONG/SINGAPORE U.S. oil and gas major Chevron Corp has put its Myanmar gas block stakes worth an estimated $1.3 billion up for sale, banking sources familiar with the matter said, in what would mark the biggest M&A transaction involving the country's assets.The sale is part of Chevron's efforts to preserve cash and retreat from non-core assets in the wake of sliding oil prices. It is also seen as setting the tone for deals in a country that  investors hope will see continued reforms after a historic election win by Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy last year.The sources said suitors could number about half a dozen and would likely include Australia's Woodside Petroleum, Thailand's PTT Exploration and Production, Japanese trading houses and Chinese companies.""Companies understand that Myanmar is in a very good position as you have export markets like China and Thailand and a growing domestic market,"" said Adrian Pooh, a Singapore-based analyst at energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie.""It's kind of one of the last few remaining exploration plays with good prospects as well."" The sources said buyers would be keen to acquire all three assets bundled together.Chevron is working with an U.S investment bank on the deal, they added, declining to be identified as the sale process has not been made public. Chevron, which has been operating in Myanmar for two decades, declined to comment.Woodside declined to comment on whether it was interested in Chevron's assets. But it highlighted its recent exploration successes in the Rakhine Basin, where it is the largest holder of acreage, as well as its partnerships across its six exploration blocks in Myanmar. Thailand's PTT Exploration and Production did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Chevron owns 28.3 percent of the Yadana and Sein gas fields operated by France's Total SA in the Andaman Sea, which mostly supplies Thai power plants and also has a stake in the pipeline company that transports the gas to the Thai border. Some of the gas is also supplied to Myanmar.Last year, it also signed a production sharing contract in exploration Block A5 in the Rakhine Basin. Its subsidiary holds a 99 percent stake in this exploration block. Chevron's net daily natural gas production in Myanmar last year averaged 117 million cubic feet, making up 2.2 percent of the company's annual gas output in 2015.Myanmar's previous record deal was Singapore's Sea View Hotel Ltd's $1 billion purchase of a hotel property in 2005, according to Thomson Reuters data.Chevron is also seeking buyers for its Asian geothermal energy blocks valued at about $3 billion, sources familiar with matter have said.

416,"   By Ernest Scheyder | HOUSTON  HOUSTON Exxon Mobil Corp and Chevron Corpon Friday reported their most dismal quarterly results in more than a decade on low oil prices and an oversupplied fuel market that hurt what had been lucrative refining margins. As crude prices slid 60 percent from mid-2014, large integrated energy companies have touted the virtues of a business model that both produces oil and refines it. Refiners typically see profitability increase when the price of their main feedstock - oil - falls. But growing fuel inventories and weak demand are now hammering the refining industry, turning a typical advantage for integrated oil companies on its head.First-quarter pain in the downstream units, which came after major U.S. refiners slashed the amount of cheap crude they were processing in February, is a sign the road ahead for oil majors may turn even rockier. Their upstream exploration and production units have been reeling for months from the crude price crash.Both Exxon and Chevron sought in Friday conference calls with investors and analysts to downplay the weakness in their refining units.Chevron Chief Financial Officer Pat Yarrington acknowledged lower worldwide refining margins on the call.Jeff Woodbury, Exxon's vice president of investor relations, blamed the weak results on lower demand and high inventories of refined gasoline and other products after a relatively warm North American winter. Lower profits from Exxon and Chevron's refining divisions contributed to weaker overall results for both companies.Exxon's net income fell 63 percent to $1.81 billion, its lowest since 1999, although analysts had expected a bigger drop.Chevron, the second-largest U.S. oil company behind Exxon,  reported a net loss of $725 million, compared with a year-earlier net profit of $2.57 billion. The loss was the biggest since 2001, and earnings before special items missed Wall Street estimates.Exxon shares were up 0.2 percent at $88.20 in afternoon trading, while Chevron fell 0.8 percent to $101.59.        For the past six years, U.S. refiners from Texas to Philadelphia have bought every barrel of crude they could lay their hands on to cash in on a golden era of healthy margins.But those are fast disappearing. Among refiners, Marathon Petroleum Corp barely eked out a profit in the first quarter, and Phillip 66's consolidated earnings fell by more than half a billion dollars to $385 million. Profits were down by nearly half at $906 million at Exxon's refining unit and at $735 million at Chevron's.  In February, at least five U.S. refiners have voluntarily reduced output of fuels in the most widespread cuts since the global financial crisis.Independent refiners including Valero Energy Corp, PBF Energy Inc, Philadelphia Energy Solutions and Monroe Energy, a unit of Delta Air Lines Inc, have curbed output, capitulating to record stockpiles and sluggish demand.Exxon has also cut the amount of crude it processes at one Texas refinery.While so-called run cuts are common for maintenance, they are rare for purely economic reasons.If the closures gather pace and refineries curb their purchases of crude further, this will heap further pressure on oil prices exploration and production companies can command.

417,"   By Ernest Scheyder | HOUSTON  HOUSTON Oil and gas producer Chevron Corp (CVX.N) on Friday posted an adjusted profit that fell short of Wall Street's expectations, as its cost cuts failed to fully offset low crude prices CLc1 and weak refining margins.    Like many of its peers, Chevron slashed spending during the quarter in response to low crude prices CLc1, but the  reductions were not as dramatic as analysts would have liked.Chevron's stock fell 1 percent to $101.50 in premarket Friday trading.  John Watson, Chevron's chief executive, said the focus of the San Ramon, California-based company's is boosting cash flow, which dropped more than 50 percent in the first quarter.""We are controlling our spend and getting key projects under construction online, which will boost revenue,"" Watson said in a press release. Chevron reported a net loss of $725 million, or 39 cents per share, compared with a net profit of $2.57 billion, or $1.37 per share, in the year-ago period.Excluding one-time items, Chevron earned 11 cents per share.By that measure, analysts, on average, expected 20 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Rival Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) reported a 63 percent drop in quarterly profit on Friday.    Chevron's production fell slightly to 2.68 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d).The company's oil and gas production arm swung to a loss of $1.46 billion because of losses in and outside the United States. As at Exxon, profit plunged at Chevron's refining division because of lower margins.Chevron's $54 billion Gorgon LNG project in Australia shut down earlier this month after mechanical problems, just weeks after it first came online. Gorgon is expected to resume production by June at the latest.Chevron said earlier this month it would sell its Hawaii refinery, long considered by the company a noncore business, to a private equity firm for an undisclosed amount.

421,"   By Alister Doyle and Gwladys Fouche | OSLO  OSLO Norway's $872-billion sovereign wealth fund, the world's largest, said it would press U.S. oil majors ExxonMobil and Chevron to do more to report on the risks of climate change.The fund said on Tuesday it would vote in favor of shareholder proposals, opposed by both companies' boards, which would require them to report more fully about the risks and opportunities of a changing climate.Royal Dutch Shell and BP adopted similar policies last year, following shareholder pressure, it said. Exxon and Chevron both say they are already doing enough to report on climate risks.""We want them to be open about their climate strategy and their dialogue with regulators,"" the fund's chief executive Yngve Slyngstad told reporters. Firms should be clear about risks, both from the impacts of climate change such as floods and storms, as well as from government policies to curb carbon emissions, he said. The fund, itself built from Norway's oil and gas wealth, was making similar demands of oil firms worldwide and would keep going even if the resolutions were defeated at Exxon's and Chevron's annual general meetings, both on May 25.""We will then come back next year and the year after,"" he said. Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM), which manages the fund, was the seventh-largest shareholder of both firms at the end of 2015, Thomson Reuters Eikon data shows.Slyngstad said the fund, which owns about 1 percent of listed equities worldwide, had 4,000 meetings with major companies a year to discuss its investments. He said many companies were planning to cut their greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent in coming years to help achieve goals set at a 195-nation Paris summit on climate change in December that include phasing out emissions by 2100.Companies ""have to explain if they don't intend to reduce their emissions to that extent,"" he said. The fund said last week that it may exclude another 40 companies for using coal in their operations after divesting from 52 since Norway's parliament last year told it to sell out of firms that get more than 30 percent of their turnover or activity from coal. Slyngstad said it was hard to set firm rules, saying a power company generating 30 percent of its electricity from coal and 70 percent from wind might stay in the portfolio ahead of a firm using 30 percent coal and the rest fossil fuels.""The fund is like a supertanker, It takes some time to turn it."" At the end of 2015, NBIM said it held a 0.78 percent stake in Exxon, valued at $2.54 billion, while its 0.85 percent holding in Chevron was worth $1.45 billion.

424,"   By Tife Owolabi | YENAGOA, Nigeria  YENAGOA, Nigeria Militants attacked a Chevron (CVX.N) platform in Nigeria's oil-rich Niger Delta region late on Wednesday, the U.S. energy company said on Thursday, amid growing fears of a revived militant campaign in the region. It is the latest in a series of attacks on oil facilities in Africa's top oil exporter. President Muhammadu Buhari has vowed to crack down on ""vandals and saboteurs"" in the Delta region, which produces most of the country's oil.In a statement, the energy company said Chevron Nigeria Limited, operator of a joint venture with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), said an attack took place at about 11.15 pm (1715 ET) on Wednesday.  ""Its Okan offshore facility in the Western Niger Delta region was breached by unknown persons,"" said Chevron in the statement. ""The facility is currently shut-in and we are assessing the situation, and have deployed resources to respond to a resulting spill.""There were no immediate details of any casualties. The company could not be reached for further comment.  A group known as the Niger Delta Avengers claimed responsibility for the attack, and in a statement it said it blew up the platform.  ""This is what we promised the Nigeria government since they refuse to listen to us,"" the group said.  The same group has said it carried out an attack on a Shell (RDSa.L) oil pipeline in February which shut down the 250,000 barrel-a-day Forcados export terminal.The militants say they want a greater share of oil revenues. Crude sales account for around 70 percent of national income in Africa's biggest economy. Pipeline attacks and violence have risen in Nigeria's southern swampland since authorities issued an arrest warrant in January for a former militant leader on corruption charges. Buhari has extended a multi-million dollar amnesty signed with militants in 2009 but upset them by ending generous pipeline protection contracts.The militancy is a further challenge for a government faced with an insurgency by the Islamist militant Boko Haram group in the northeast and violent clashes between armed nomadic herdsmen and locals over land use in various parts of the country.

425,"  MELBOURNE Chevron Corp has appointed a new chief executive for its Australian operations after starting production at its $54 billion Gorgon liquefied natural gas (LNG) project, which last month ran into trouble after shipping one cargo.Chevron promoted its deputy managing director in Australia Nigel Hearne to take over from long-time managing director Roy Krzywosinski, who will be moving to Houston as head of engineering in Chevron's Energy Technology Company.""Nigel's appointment reflects his strong downstream and upstream operating experience, combined with his proven record of leading large, complex operations, such as our Richmond refinery,"" Steve Green, president of Chevron Asia Pacific Exploration and Production said in a statement on Thursday. The Gorgon LNG project, Chevron's all-time largest investment, was forced to stop production in April due to a mechanical problem in a cooling unit. It is set to restart this month, the company said at its quarterly results last Friday. Krzyowinski returns to Houston after more than eight years heading the Australian operations, overseeing the development of Gorgon and the $29 billion Wheatstone LNG project, which is due to start producing in mid-2017.

430,"  (Refiling to reach a wider audience)By Hillary FlynnNEW YORK, May 13 (IFR) - Oil and gas producer Chevron had a tough time selling debt in the high-grade bond market this week in the wake of heavy supply, the weak performance of some newly minted energy bonds and a lack of conviction about the recent rally in the sector's credits.Chevron sold one of the biggest bond deals of this week - a US$6.8bn issue to refinance existing debt. But in contrast to some other companies selling jumbo trades at the same time - including a US$7.8bn transaction from AbbVie- it could not budge pricing during the bookbuilding process.Chevron priced the six-part deal at the same levels as initial guidance - an unusual occurrence in what is a relatively buoyant market for the majority of high-grade borrowers.That left the company paying a high new-issue concession of about 20bp.Some attributed the relatively poor outcome to its recent earnings. In a results announcement at the end of April, Chevron missed profit expectations and reported a net loss of US$725m, compared with a net profit of US$2.57bn a year ago.That led some on the buyside to demand more spread as compensation for what they still see as a precarious outlook for the sector.Just a couple of weeks ago, ExxonMobil lost its prized Triple A rating and others in the sector have also released dismal results as a rally in oil prices came too late to boost earnings.At the same time, some oil heavyweights are still carrying out shareholder-friendly activities to the detriment of bondholders. Chevron, for example, has maintained its dividend throughout despite the sector's woes. ""Chevron is not generating any cash right now, and its dividend tends to be top priority,"" Matt Brill, portfolio manager at Invesco, told IFR.""It is very focused on its equity holders.""Sour secondariesChevron may also have come up against some price sensitivity after heavy supply from other companies in the sector. A raft of oil heavyweights including BP, ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil and Shell have sold bonds in the last few weeks - but a fair number of them have widened in the aftermarket.Shell International's US$7.25bn four-part deal, which was priced earlier this month, has left some investors particularly wary.The three longest-dated tranches are all trading wide of their reoffer prices in secondary, and Shell's 1.75bn bond this week, split between eight and 12-year tranches, has not fared much better.Like the US dollar bond, the euro bonds quickly soured in secondary trading, with the longer tranche widening by 3bp.""What stopped Chevron's books from really exploding is Shell not doing that well in the secondary, and everyone had thought Shell would [perform well],"" one investor said. Shell reported its lowest annual income in more than a decade during its latest earnings report in February 2016 as its income fell by 87% to US$1.94bn.Other deals have also failed to perform in secondary trading, including BP Capital Market's US$1.25bn 10-year trade, which was priced at Treasuries plus 130bp at the end of April and is 1bp wider now.That is despite BP attracting a US$9.8bn book at the time of the sale, which included a US$750m three-year tranche.BP had a tough first quarter, reporting an 80% drop in profits just before the bond sale.Push-backSome of the investor push-back to Chevron's deal is also because of a lack of conviction in the current rally in energy sector spreads following the uptick in oil prices.US crude was trading up at US$46.5 a barrel on Thursday - some US$10 higher than it was a month ago. And thanks to this increase, average energy spreads are now 14bp tighter since the start of April and a whopping 164bp tighter since wides of Treasuries plus 403bp on February 11.""People need to ensure they are compensated for the risk they are taking on,"" said Paul Suter, a fixed-income trader at ECM.

Chevron is selling assets, cutting jobs globally and slashing capital spending to save cash and preserve dividends amid weak oil prices.""There's no formal documentation yet so we don't know the terms,"" Aboitiz Power President Antonio Moraza told reporters separately after a stockholders' meeting.""When it comes out we will study it carefully, and we will most likely want to participate."" It remains unclear whether or not Chevron would offer its Indonesian and Philippine geothermal assets to bidders in separate blocks.""We've heard some rumours that it might be separate,"" Moraza said. ""I think for Indonesia it will be prudent on our part to have a partner.""Asked if a potential bidder has approached Aboitiz Power for a partnership, Moraza said, ""Definitely we're talking."" He declined to elaborate.Aboitiz Power, along with its partners, currently has 44 generation facilities with capacity of about 2,400 megawatts (MW). Geothermal accounts for 12 percent of that.Geothermal energy is created by the heat of the earth. It generates reliable power and emits almost no greenhouse gases.Two Chevron subsidiaries operate geothermal projects in Salak and Darajat fields in west Java with capacity of nearly 650 MW.Chevron has a 40 percent interest in Philippine Geothermal Production Co, which produces steam energy for third party-owned geothermal power plants and have a combined capacity of 692 MW.

436,"  Shareholders of Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) and Chevron Corp (CVX.N), two of the world's largest oil producers, will vote on Wednesday on a raft of proposals designed to push the companies to respond more proactively to climate change risks and regulations.   The stakes are highest at Exxon, which has come under intense scrutiny from environmentalists and some investors this past year over the way it handled climate change data. With public sentiment pressuring big oil companies on environmental issues, the votes this year could mark the first time a climate change-related proposal passes muster with a majority of Exxon's shareholders.Below is a summary of key issues on ballots for the annual meetings:EXXON MOBIL  RESOLUTION 5: ADD CLIMATE EXPERT TO BOARD The resolution's sponsor, a group of Wisconsin monks, says that by adding a climate expert to its board, Exxon would be able to ""more effectively address the environmental issues and risks inherent in its present business model.""Exxon's recommended vote: No. Executives say holding a board seat for a ""single-issue candidate who lacks other important attributes would, in our view, not be in the best interests of the company.""RESOLUTION 7: PROXY ACCESS BYLAW This resolution's sponsor, New York City pension funds, says minority shareholders with a 3 percent stake in the company should be able to nominate directors to the company's board. This is part of a broader shareholder push to put climate experts on the boards of oil companies.Exxon's recommended vote: No. It highlighted ""the potential risk for the proposal to increase the influence of special interest groups"" on the board.RESOLUTION 10: BOOST SHAREHOLDER PAYOUTS This resolution's sponsor, an investor with 200 shares, wants Exxon to increase dividends and share buybacks, rather than invest in new oil or gas deposits, claiming that climate change throws the long-term viability of the company's business model into doubt.Exxon's recommended vote: No. Executives defended their history of generous shareholder payouts and noted they use a proxy cost for carbon, which takes into account potential impacts from climate change and environmental legislation. RESOLUTION 11: SUPPORT THE PARIS AGREEMENT This resolution's sponsor, a group of New Jersey nuns, wants Exxon to support the Paris climate accords with a company policy that commits to limit global warming to less than 2 degrees Celsius. Exxon's recommended vote: No. Executives said they take the risks of climate change seriously and also have an obligation to ""invest in economically attractive energy sources in an environmentally responsible manner.""RESOLUTION 12: PUBLISH AN ANNUAL CLIMATE CHANGE REPORT This resolution's sponsor, the New York State Common Retirement Fund, which holds nearly 11 million Exxon shares, wants the company to publish a report annually that would outline how climate change could affect the company's ability to operate.Exxon's recommended vote: No. Executives noted the company already updates its annual Outlook For Energy report with the latest climate policy information.RESOLUTION 13: REPORT RESERVES IN BRITISH THERMAL UNITS  The resolution's sponsor, the environmental group As You Sow, wants Exxon to report its reserves of oil and natural gas in British Thermal Units, arguing it is a better metric to track the company's effect on, and vulnerability to, climate change.Exxon's recommended vote: No. Executives note the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission requires oil assets be reported in barrels.CHEVRON  Note: Chevron does not identify resolution sponsors.RESOLUTION 6: TARGETS FOR GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS CUTS The sponsor wants Chevron to set goals for how the company can best comply with the Paris climate agreements and arrange its business operations in such a way as to help limit global warming to less than 2 degrees C.Chevron's recommended vote: No. Executives say such a requirement could put the company at an economic disadvantage in some countries where it operates. RESOLUTION 7: CLIMATE CHANGE REPORT The sponsor wants Chevron to publish an annual report from 2017 through 2035 outlining how legislation designed to curb climate change could affect its business operations. Chevron's recommended vote: No. Executives say such a report is ""unnecessary in light of the safeguards"" in place throughout its operations.RESOLUTION 8: REPORT RESERVES IN BRITISH THERMAL UNITS  The sponsor wants Chevron to report its reserves of oil and natural gas in British Thermal Units, arguing it is a better metric to track the company's effect on, and vulnerability to, climate change.Chevron's recommended vote: No. Executives note the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission requires oil assets be reported in barrels.RESOLUTION 9: BOOST SHAREHOLDER PAYOUTS This sponsor wants Chevron to increase dividends and share buybacks, claiming that climate change throws the long-term viability of the company's business model into doubt.Chevron's recommended vote: No. Executives say the proposal is based on a ""flawed, if not dangerous, premise: that stockholders would be best served if Chevron stopped investing in its business.""RESOLUTION 11: BOARD MEMBER WITH ENVIRONMENTAL EXPERTISE This sponsor wants more candidates for Chevron's board with a ""high level of expertise and experience in environmental matters"" who are also independent of the company's management.Chevron's recommended vote: No. Executives say the current board has ""significant environmental experience.""

With public sentiment pressuring big oil companies on environmental issues, the votes this year could mark the first time a climate change-related proposal passes muster with a majority of Exxon's shareholders.Below is a summary of key issues on ballots for the annual meetings:EXXON MOBIL  RESOLUTION 5: ADD CLIMATE EXPERT TO BOARD The resolution's sponsor, a group of Wisconsin monks, says that by adding a climate expert to its board, Exxon would be able to ""more effectively address the environmental issues and risks inherent in its present business model.""Exxon's recommended vote: No. Executives say holding a board seat for a ""single-issue candidate who lacks other important attributes would, in our view, not be in the best interests of the company.""RESOLUTION 7: PROXY ACCESS BYLAW This resolution's sponsor, New York City pension funds, says minority shareholders with a 3 percent stake in the company should be able to nominate directors to the company's board. This is part of a broader shareholder push to put climate experts on the boards of oil companies.Exxon's recommended vote: No. It highlighted ""the potential risk for the proposal to increase the influence of special interest groups"" on the board.RESOLUTION 10: BOOST SHAREHOLDER PAYOUTS This resolution's sponsor, an investor with 200 shares, wants Exxon to increase dividends and share buybacks, rather than invest in new oil or gas deposits, claiming that climate change throws the long-term viability of the company's business model into doubt.Exxon's recommended vote: No. Executives defended their history of generous shareholder payouts and noted they use a proxy cost for carbon, which takes into account potential impacts from climate change and environmental legislation. RESOLUTION 11: SUPPORT THE PARIS AGREEMENT This resolution's sponsor, a group of New Jersey nuns, wants Exxon to support the Paris climate accords with a company policy that commits to limit global warming to less than 2 degrees Celsius. Exxon's recommended vote: No. Executives said they take the risks of climate change seriously and also have an obligation to ""invest in economically attractive energy sources in an environmentally responsible manner.""RESOLUTION 12: PUBLISH AN ANNUAL CLIMATE CHANGE REPORT This resolution's sponsor, the New York State Common Retirement Fund, which holds nearly 11 million Exxon shares, wants the company to publish a report annually that would outline how climate change could affect the company's ability to operate.Exxon's recommended vote: No. Executives noted the company already updates its annual Outlook For Energy report with the latest climate policy information.RESOLUTION 13: REPORT RESERVES IN BRITISH THERMAL UNITS  The resolution's sponsor, the environmental group As You Sow, wants Exxon to report its reserves of oil and natural gas in British Thermal Units, arguing it is a better metric to track the company's effect on, and vulnerability to, climate change.Exxon's recommended vote: No. Executives note the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission requires oil assets be reported in barrels.CHEVRON  Note: Chevron does not identify resolution sponsors.RESOLUTION 6: TARGETS FOR GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS CUTS The sponsor wants Chevron to set goals for how the company can best comply with the Paris climate agreements and arrange its business operations in such a way as to help limit global warming to less than 2 degrees C.Chevron's recommended vote: No. Executives say such a requirement could put the company at an economic disadvantage in some countries where it operates. RESOLUTION 7: CLIMATE CHANGE REPORT The sponsor wants Chevron to publish an annual report from 2017 through 2035 outlining how legislation designed to curb climate change could affect its business operations. Chevron's recommended vote: No. Executives say such a report is ""unnecessary in light of the safeguards"" in place throughout its operations.RESOLUTION 8: REPORT RESERVES IN BRITISH THERMAL UNITS  The sponsor wants Chevron to report its reserves of oil and natural gas in British Thermal Units, arguing it is a better metric to track the company's effect on, and vulnerability to, climate change.Chevron's recommended vote: No. Executives note the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission requires oil assets be reported in barrels.RESOLUTION 9: BOOST SHAREHOLDER PAYOUTS This sponsor wants Chevron to increase dividends and share buybacks, claiming that climate change throws the long-term viability of the company's business model into doubt.Chevron's recommended vote: No. Executives say the proposal is based on a ""flawed, if not dangerous, premise: that stockholders would be best served if Chevron stopped investing in its business.""RESOLUTION 11: BOARD MEMBER WITH ENVIRONMENTAL EXPERTISE This sponsor wants more candidates for Chevron's board with a ""high level of expertise and experience in environmental matters"" who are also independent of the company's management.Chevron's recommended vote: No. Executives say the current board has ""significant environmental experience.""

439,"  DALLAS/SAN RAMON Calif. May 25 Voters at Exxon Mobil's annual meeting approved a measure on Wednesday to let minority shareholders nominate outsiders for seats on the company's board, meaning a climate activist could eventually become a director at the oil giant.Exxon's board had opposed the proposal, saying it risked increasing the influence of ""special interest groups"" as oil companies grapple with the impact of the Paris Accord on climate change that aims to curb fossil fuel emissions.  The so-called proxy access measure, which passed last year at fellow U.S. major Chevron Corp, was the only one of 11 shareholder proposals related to climate change to pass at annual meetings held on Wednesday by both companies.

440,"  BANGKOK May 25 Thailand wants to negotiate a better return from its petroleum concessions held by Chevron Corp and Thailand's PTT Exploration and Production , the Energy Minister said on Wednesday.Minister Anantaporn Kanjanarat said energy policy makers would meet on Monday to discuss increasing the government's share of the revenue in return for extending the contracts, which are due to expire in 2022-2023.If they fail to reach new deals, another option would be to put the concessions up for auction, Anantaporn told reporters at a seminar, adding that the plan was subject to cabinet approval.The ministry would only negotiate with the oil companies after getting cabinet approval.The two contracts account for about 65 percent of Thailand's petroleum output. Under the existing deals, the government receives taxes and royalties equivalent to about 67 percent of pretax profits from production. Thailand relies natural gas to generate nearly 70 percent of its power and is under pressure to secure long-term energy supplies as its own resources are expected to run out in six to seven years.About a fifth of its supplies are piped in from neighbouring Myanmar but imports are likely to fall as the country is expected to use more of its natural gas for its own development. Thailand is also considering raising its long-term target for renewable energy if production costs continue to fall as part of its drive to reduce dependence on fossil fuels, the energy minister said.New technologies have helped cut average production costs for renewables by 30 percent a year in the past seven years to 30 million baht ($840,000) per megawatt, he said, adding they were likely to fall another 20 percent over the next five years. The military government wants to boost renewable energy to more than 19,000 megawatts, or 30 percent of its total energy production mix, by 2036, the minister said, citing the latest power development plan.As of April, Thailand had signed contracts with power producers to buy 9,041 MW of renewable energy, mostly biomass and solar, and about two-thirds had already been linked to the national grid, he said.($1 = 35.6600 baht)   (Reporting by Manunphattr Dhanananphorn and Khettiya Jittapong; editing by David Clarke)",2016-05-25,CVX,"Wed May 25, 2016 | 9:12am EDT",Thailand considers options for petroleum concession deals,http://www.reuters.com//article/thailand-petroleum-concession-idUSL3N18M37T?type=companyNews

A militant group called the Niger Delta Avengers, which has told oil firms to leave the Delta before the end of May, said late on Wednesday that it had blown up the Chevron's facility's mains electricity feed. Its attacks have hobbled oil output over the past month.A company source told Reuters that ""all activities in Chevron are grounded"" onshore while oil industry sources said roughly 90,000 barrels per day (bpd) of Escravos were gone due to the latest attack and another on Chevron's offshore facilities earlier this month. Planned Escravos exports in the first half of 2016 averaged 167,000 bpd.

The Avengers, who have given oil firms until end of the month to leave in what they frame as struggle for the Delta's independence, have intensified attacks in recent weeks, pushing oil output to its lowest in more than 20 years and compounding the problems of Africa's largest economy.Abuja has responded by moving in army reinforcements but British Foreign Minister Philip Hammond said this month that President Muhammadu Buhari needed to deal with the root causes.In the first signal that the government might try a less heavy-handed approach, Oil Minister Emmanuel Ibe Kachikwu said an amnesty program for former militants, signed in 2009 to end a previous insurgency, needed to improve. The amnesty needed to address ""neglect by the government and international oil companies,"" Kachikwu said. The scheme had funded cash benefits and job training to militants who have laid down their arms but has been cut by the government by two-thirds, fuelling dissent.""The Niger Delta governors must be involved in providing lasting solutions to the resurgence of pipeline vandalism and there is urgent need to create business opportunities for the locals in the region,"" Kachikwu said in a statement. Moving in the same direction, a committee set up by Delta state leaders warned that a military approach would not work and saw ""an apparent consensus"" that the federal government and oil companies have neglected the grievances of local communities.Delta residents, some of whom sympathize with the militants, have long complained of poverty in an area producing oil accounting for 70 percent of national income.Nigeria is now pumping under 1.5 million bpd - less than Angola - and well below the 2.2 million bpd assumed in the 2016 state budget.

447,"   By Pracha Hariraksapitak | BANGKOK  BANGKOK Thailand's military government plans to put up for auction petroleum concessions held by Chevron Corp and PTT Exploration and Production Pcl, Energy Minister Anantaporn Kanjanarat said on Monday.Chevron's Thai unit holds concessions to operate the Erawan gas field, while PTTEP operates the Bongkot gas field. The two have combined production of 2.2 billion cubic feet per day, or 76 percent of output in the Gulf of Thailand.  The auction for the contracts, due to expire in 2022-2023, is expected to be completed within a year, Anantaporn told reporters following a meeting of Thailand's energy policy panel. He gave no details of auction timing.""This is to ensure transparency and we have to listen to opinion from all parties,"" he added, referring to the decision to hold the auction, which followed opposition by some activists to a proposal to extend contracts with existing operators.  If there are no interested bidders, the government will negotiate extensions with the existing holders, Anantaporn said, adding that the two companies are allowed to join the bidding. PTTEP Chief Executive Somporn Vongvuthipornchai said the company was ready to join the bidding and urged the government to give clear terms of the auction. An official at Chevron Thai unit said the company would work with the Thai government to prevent disruption to gas supplies.      Thailand, which uses natural gas for almost 70 percent of its power generation, may need to import more gas over the next seven or eight years to secure its energy supplies, he said. Existing operators may not invest a lot of money to keep up production after the government decides to invite bids from new investors, which could take longer than negotiating with existing operators, he added.Chevron's Thai unit has said it plans to lay off 800 staff in Thailand this year as it looks to cut $500 million in costs.    The bidding is also pending an amendment of a new energy law, which will add production-sharing contract terms to existing concession contracts by which firms pay taxes and royalties, the minister said. The amendment was expected to be completed within the next three or four months, he said. The military government is struggling to implement a draft energy law approved in late 2015 that will enable it to open a bidding round for new petroleum exploration concessions expected in the second half.

459,"  * Angola LNG's return brings relief amid project delays* Up to six more cargoes may be offered by Angola -trader   (Adds company statement)By Oleg Vukmanovic  and Sarah McFarlaneMILAN/LONDON, June 6 Angola's recently refurbished liquefied natural gas (LNG) export plant has launched a tender to sell its first cargo since it was unexpectedly shut down in April 2014.According to tender document details relayed by traders, the cargo was loaded between June 3 and 5 on board the Sonangol Sambizanga tanker and bid submissions are due on the morning of June 13, trade sources said.Angola LNG confirmed the first cargo since the shutdown had been loaded and was being sold via an international tender but did not give further details of the process.The tender is valid until June 15, one source said, while a second trader said that up to six more cargoes could be loaded before the facility goes offline for a final phase of testing.In the current tender, the delivery date of the first cargo varies according to the location of terminals dotted around the world. For example, the Chevron-led project lists a six-week delivery window for Argentina's Bahia Blanca terminal - between June 28 and August 14, one trader said.The cargo may be priced based on levels at Britain's gas trading hub, the National Balancing Point, or as a percentage of Brent crude oil, he said.During the period the plant was shutdown LNG prices fell by around two-thirds to trade below $5 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) this year. ""The market has changed a lot while our plant has been shut down, but we are pleased to be able to deliver Angola LNG to the world and to take our place as a reliable and safe supplier in global LNG markets,"" Artur Pereira, chief executive of Angola LNG Marketing said.MARKET IMPACT Resuming supply from Angola may bring a measure of relief to buyers as delays to new projects and supply outages have helped to nudge spot LNG prices higher in the past few weeks. The combined impact of these delays means there is less supply in the market than traders previously assumed, prompting some to cover short positions they otherwise intended to keep open.Exports from Chevron's new Gorgon export facility in Australia are not expected to resume until the end of the month, industry sources said, following an unplanned shutdown in April.Meanwhile, Houston-based Cheniere Energy has already said that the completion of its second production line at Sabine Pass would be delayed until August, from June.And a second line at Origin Energy's AP LNG project is also running behind schedule, sliding from the third-quarter into the fourth, according to trade sources.Angolan supply, although still slight by global measures, may help to allay any residual fears of supply tightness as Asian markets head into peak summer demand season, traders have said.Chevron has a 36.4 percent share in Angola LNG, while Angolan state oil firm Sonangol has 22.8 percent. Other stakeholders include Total, BP and ENI .

467,"   By Jessica Resnick-Ault | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Global oil majors Chevron Corp and Royal Dutch Shell Plc are putting small refineries on the auction block as they look to trim lower-margin assets in the face of headwinds from rising crude oil prices.Chevron, the second largest U.S. oil company, is soliciting interest in its Burnaby, British Columbia, refinery and gasoline stations, the company told Reuters. Shell is looking for buyers for its Martinez, California, refinery, two people familiar with the situation told Reuters. Shell declined to comment.These two companies, along with peers Exxon Mobil Corp and BP Plc, have sold more than a million barrels per day of U.S. refining capacity in the past three years, according to Stratas Advisors, a Houston-based consultancy. The world's five largest oil majors together still have enough U.S. capacity to refine about 4.7 million barrels per day. Refining profit margins have declined from highs seen in 2015, and the fear is that as crude prices recover from a two-year rout, refiners will be squeezed as the cost of oil rises but the price of gasoline does not keep pace. Selling the plants while margins are still reasonably high allows the majors to exit without a hit to their balance sheets. Chevron also told Reuters it has retained Rothschild & Co to market its 75 percent stake in a South Africa refinery. The fifth oil major, Paris-based Total SA, retained Lazard to sell a 50 percent stake in its sole U.S. refinery, but was unable to secure the price it desired, according to sources. Refining has remained a profitable sector during a two-year oil price rout, so these plants can fetch a relatively higher price than exploration and production assets. Chevron and Shell have the highest cash-flow deficits, said Lysle Brinker, director of equity research at IHS Energy, and so have the most motivation to sell. The two companies have been investing in other areas of their business - Shell plunked down $53 billion to buy BG Group earlier this year, while Chevron has spent heavily on large-scale liquefied natural gas projects.“They’re much more strapped for cash, and they’re accelerating the sale of assets that will get pretty decent prices,"" said Brinker. ""A lot of the asset sales that the big guys have been selling are downstream and midstream, because those have been sought-after by private equity and others because there’s more steady cash flow.”These assets may prove to be a better fit for smaller buyers that focus on particular regions, such as the North American West Coast, or companies that concentrate on global storage and trading, but not oil production.  SMALLER ASSETS ON BLOCK While the majors plan to continue to operate large, profitable refineries that are well integrated with their oil production assets, refineries outside of that footprint are likely to be sold, Brinker said. Chevron's downstream strategy has focused on running large scale refineries that can serve markets in the United States and Asia and on operating petrochemical plants that produce very profitable products.  The refinery in British Columbia, however, refines light oil, rather than heavy crude from Canada's oil sands, and its products are distributed in a smaller region around British Columbia and down through Washington state. Selling smaller assets like that is likely something most companies are looking at  - or should be - said Mark Routt, chief economist for the Americas with KBC Advanced Technologies in Houston. ""Far better to sell it when it's good times than bad times,"" Routt said. ""It's not as good as it was in '15, but it’s still good times.""Chevron in April agreed to sell its 54,000 barrel-per-day Kapolei, Hawaii, refinery to a group backed by private equity, and Shell agreed in March to exit its Motiva Enterprises joint venture with Saudi Aramco. Shell is shedding a plant in Texas as a result of the dissolution of that venture. Chevron previously said it would sell its 75 percent stake in its South African unit, which includes a refinery in Cape Town.

468,"   By Florence Tan and Seng Li Peng | SINGAPORE  SINGAPORE Australia is in pole position to capture a bigger piece of the growing Asian condensate market, with producers pumping new supplies of the ultra-light oil as natural gas output soars to feed the nation's mega LNG projects.An Australian wave of liquefied natural gas supply has helped pull Asian LNG prices down by 75 percent since 2014, so selling more lucrative condensate to Asian buyers could give a lifeline to less profitable projects.Australia's Ichthys LNG export project, for instance, operated by Japan's Inpex Corp, could produce more than 100,000 barrels per day (bpd) of condensate when it starts up next year. ""The fact that the project is liquid-rich is one of the reasons that this project is economically in good standing,"" an Inpex spokesman said, adding that the company has started marketing its condensate, primarily to customers in Asia. Condensate is a light oil produced in association with natural gas, and its consumption is rising across Asia as new refineries or splitters come online to meet strong demand for it to be used to make the chemical feedstock naphtha. (See for a table of new splitters in Asia.) Besides Inpex, Chevron Corp plans to produce 38,000 bpd of condensate once it ramps up its Gorgon LNG project on Barrow Island off the northwest coast of Western Australia. Chevron declined to comment for this article.  The circle of condensate suppliers is small, though, and Australia has the inside track on selling to Asia, especially with some Middle East producers building their own splitters. ""The outlook is quite pessimistic (for buyers) as sweet condensate supplies are very limited,"" said an Asian oil buyer who declined to be named due to company policy. Qatar, a traditional exporter to Asia, plans to divert a third of its output to its own splitter by January.Rival producer Iran could fill some of that shortfall, and it has stepped up exports to South Korea following the lifting of sanctions against Tehran, hitting a record in June.     Quality issues with Iran's condensate, however, limit its attraction to buyers. The outlook on its supplies is also murky on delays in the start-up of its splitter projects and a ramp-up of production from its South Pars field.     Premiums for Qatari condensate loading in February hit a record, but have since fallen back on weak naphtha margins. The rise in condensate use as splitters start up from September could drive premiums higher again, traders said.   CUTTING ASIA NAPHTHA SHORTFALL  Asia's petrochemical makers are net short of naphtha, although that deficit is expected to fall as much as 5.5 percent next year to 5.2 million to 5.3 million tonnes a month, according to Premasish Das, director for Asia and Middle East downstream oil markets at energy consultancy IHS. The drop will come as condensate splitters that were planned a few years back to capture growth in petrochemical markets come online in Asia to feed adjacent paraxylene units.   Combined condensate supplies from Ichthys and Gorgon of almost 140,000 bpd will initially meet a rise in Asian splitter capacity of 160,000 bpd in Taiwan and South Korea between late 2016 and early 2017. Two more splitters, one in Singapore and one China, are also set to restart following unplanned outages, and at some point will add back another 190,000 bpd in condensate demand, tightening the market for the light oil. That means Asian naphtha buyers will take up less of a current global surplus, further undermining profit margins for the light oil product. Benchmark Singapore naphtha refinery margins from refining a barrel of Brent crude, have already tumbled more than 60 percent since the beginning of the year to around $54 per ton on June 21.

470,"   By Lisa Lambert | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday approved a rule requiring oil, gas and mining companies to disclose payments made to foreign governments, capping a process stalled in the courts for years.The rule requires companies to state publicly starting in 2018 how much they pay governments in taxes, royalties and other types of fees for exploration, extraction and other activities.It will ""provide enhanced transparency,"" SEC Chair Mary Jo White said in a statement. Frustrated with delays, human rights group Oxfam in 2014 sued the SEC over the rule, which was mandated by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Law passed four years earlier. In September, a federal judge ordered the commission to fast-track the rule, setting Monday as a deadline. Regulators released a draft in December.""After six years, we are very pleased to see the SEC release final rules that align with those in other markets by requiring fully public, company-by-company, project-level reporting with no categorical exemptions,"" said Ian Gary, associate policy director at Oxfam America, in a statement. ""This is a huge victory for investors and for citizens in resource-rich countries around the world who wish to follow the money their governments receive from oil and mining companies."" The rule will cover major corporations such as Exxon, Chevron and Shell, as well as state-owned companies in China and Brazil, according to Oxfam. Under the final rules, ""resource extraction"" companies must disclose payments made to further the commercial development of oil, natural gas or minerals and that total more than $100,000 during a single fiscal year for each of their projects.

471,"   By Lisa Lambert | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday approved a rule requiring oil, gas and mining companies to disclose payments made to foreign governments, capping a process stalled in the courts for years.The rule requires companies to state publicly starting in 2018 how much they pay governments in taxes, royalties and other types of fees for exploration, extraction and other activities.It will ""provide enhanced transparency,"" SEC Chair Mary Jo White said in a statement.Frustrated with delays, human rights group Oxfam in 2014 sued the SEC over the rule, which was mandated by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Law passed four years earlier. In September, a federal judge ordered the commission to fast-track the rule, setting Monday as a deadline. Regulators released a draft in December. ""After six years, we are very pleased to see the SEC release final rules that align with those in other markets by requiring fully public, company-by-company, project-level reporting with no categorical exemptions,” said Ian Gary, associate policy director at Oxfam America, in a statement. ""This is a huge victory for investors and for citizens in resource-rich countries around the world who wish to follow the money their governments receive from oil and mining companies.""The rule will cover major corporations such as Exxon, Chevron and Shell, as well as state-owned companies in China and Brazil, according to Oxfam. Under the final rules, ""resource extraction"" companies must disclose payments made to further the commercial development of oil, natural gas or minerals and that total more than $100,000 during a single fiscal year for each of their projects. Those payments can include taxes, royalties, fees, bonuses, dividends and social responsibility payments. Companies must disclose payments made by their subsidiaries, or any other entities they control, as well.The rule exempts a company from reporting payment information for a firm it has acquired in the first year after the acquisition, and also allows companies to delay disclosure for a year on payments related to exploration.

Traders said that prices were supported by strong demand and also by Chevron's huge but troubled Gorgon LNG plant in Australia, with the latest technical incident a gas leak reported on Friday, although Chevron said the facility ""remains on track to load the second cargo of Gorgon LNG in the coming days.""Prices were also supported by firm Asian demand. Driven by upticks in Japanese, Taiwanese and also Chinese imports, LNG shipments into North Asia have risen from weekly levels of around 3 billion cubic metres (bcm) to 4 bcm between mid-May and mid-June, according to Eikon data.Volatile financial markets this week after Britain's vote to leave the European Union also pushed up gas prices.With the British pound falling against other currencies, UK gas prices were pushed higher across the curve . That lifted Asian spot LNG prices since international gas traders look towards Britain's gas market for guidance as it can take in supplies from multiple sources, including continental European pipelines and overseas LNG imports.Also, Qatar's RasGas this week signed an agreement with France's EDF to deliver up to 2 million tonnes per year of LNG to EDF's new terminal in Dunkerque starting in 2017, pulling supply away from Asian markets.With the opening of the extended Panama Canal last week, traders said LNG markets would become better connected, improving trade flows between the Atlantic and Pacific basins.""The expanded Panama Canal increases LNG's reach and flexibility,"" Singapore's exchange SGX said. The British Merchant LNG tanker, loaded with gas from Trinidad & Tobago, is scheduled to be the first LNG tanker to travel through the expanded Panama Canal.But traders said that recent gas price rises might not last, with downward pressure building in both Europe and Asia.With the start of the monsoon season, likely lasting through September, traders expect lower LNG orders from India.In Europe, analysts said that recent price rallies might also fizzle out.""The rally in European... gas prices is unlikely to be sustained and we expect global gas prices to remain low in an oversupplied market over the second half of 2016,"" analysts at BMI Research said.""Markets have tightened in recent months but global supply is still robust at a time when there is limited demand-side pressure on prices,"" they added.(Additional reporting by Oleg Vukmanovic in MILAN; Editing by Christian Schmollinger)",2016-07-01,CVX,"Fri Jul 1, 2016 | 3:23am EDT","UPDATE 2-Stronger North Asian demand, Gorgon gas leak lift Asian LNG prices",http://www.reuters.com//article/global-lng-idUSL4N19N1YD?type=companyNews

498,"   By Sonali Paul, Oleg Vukmanovic  and Ron Bousso | MELBOURNE/MILAN/LONDON -  MELBOURNE/MILAN/LONDON - Forced to shut its $54 billion Gorgon liquefied natural gas (LNG) export plant twice in its first five months, Chevron Corp now faces calls from union officials for a probe into the site's safety.Chevron denies there have been any safety breaches at the plant but is under pressure to resolve problems that have limited exports to just two cargoes since starting operations in March.The Australian Manufacturing Workers' Union (AMWU) has told Reuters it has formally requested access to the site.""The AMWU has concerns about safety at Gorgon,"" Steve McCartney, West Australian secretary of the AMWU, told Reuters via email. A failed weld on a valve casing called a trunnion caused the gas leak that forced the plant to close on July 1, he said. ""The AMWU wants to know why it failed, and what checks were carried out to ensure it met Australian standards,"" McCartney said. Chevron called the leak ""minor"", although it did evacuate some workers. On Wednesday the company said it expected to resume production shortly.""Chevron Australia is in discussions with the AMWU to visit the site as part of usual union engagement with its members,"" a spokeswoman said, adding that there had been no safety breaches at the plant.Reuters could not independently confirm whether the issues at the plant pose any risk to worker safety. MISTAKES  Chevron, which is counting on Gorgon to help it become an LNG leader in Asia, reported its first shutdown in April and was forced to shut again following a gas leak on July 1.In interviews with Reuters, site workers and industry sources familiar with operations at Gorgon said mistakes led to the first shutdown.According to information provided by one engineer at the plant, liquid propane in the refrigerant circuit flooded into a section of pipeline meant to handle gases only.Metal debris inside the piping was propelled along at speed, damaging equipment and producing ""very loud clunking noises"" which prompted operators to initiate emergency shutdown procedures, according to one worker and corroborated by AMWU's McCartney.Chevron said the problem occurred in the propane refrigerant circuit where natural gas is cooled into a liquid but declined to provide further details.  LAGGING RIVALS The shutdowns have cost Gorgon more than $200 million in lost output, excluding repairs and other expenditures, one industry consultant estimated, basing the figure on an export schedule of around one cargo per week.The outages have also contributed to a jump in global LNG spot prices, which are up by around 40 percent since April. [LNG-AS]Two industry sources said Chevron ignored advice from project partners Royal Dutch Shell and Exxon Mobil to go slow with the launch of Gorgon.""We do not comment on industry rumor or speculation,"" Chevron said. Royal Dutch Shell and Exxon also declined to comment. ""Gorgon's teething issues mirror the ongoing problems at Angola LNG and put the spotlight on Chevron,"" said Rystad Energy analyst Readul Islam regarding Chevron's ability to deliver LNG plants.  Chevron and partners BP, ENI and Total has just finished work on its LNG plant in Angola following a two-year shutdown to fix design flaws. Operations tentatively resumed at the plant just last month.Meanwhile, rivals have moved forward, with Exxon Mobil launching its Papua New Guinea (PNG LNG) liquefaction plant on time and on budget in 2014, when Gorgon was first due to start operations. ""The relatively niggle-free ramp-up of Gladstone LNG (in Australia) as well as the PNG LNG trains over the past two years could lead to questions being asked of Gorgon's onshore (start-up) team,"" said Rystad's Islam, but he added that Gorgon's greater complexity and size arguably make it a bigger challenge.Industry sources and analysts continue to project start-up delays at subsequent phases of Gorgon due partly to the latest hiatus.Chevron denies this. It says that construction on Gorgon production lines two and three, which will boost its export capacity to 15.6 million tonnes a year in 2017, are unaffected.Peter Coleman, chief executive of Woodside Petroleum which is partnered with Chevron in developing the $33 billion Wheatstone LNG project in Australia, said his company was taking a more hands-on role in development as Chevron is ""having to direct resources elsewhere"".But he added he had no concerns about Chevron as a project operator.""They've got a lot on their plate and so many hands help, and that's where we are at the moment,"" he said.

499,"  CARACAS, July 23 Ecuador has paid $112 million to energy company Chevron Corp over a four-decade-old contract dispute, even though it remains in disagreement, the head of the central bank has said.A Hague arbitration court awarded the U.S. company $96 million in 2011 in a dispute stemming from a 1973 deal that called for Texaco, later acquired by Chevron, to develop fields in exchange for selling oil to Ecuador at below-market rates.Various appeals by Ecuador against the ruling failed.""We have today paid around $112 million,"" the central bank head Diego Martinez told a local radio station late on Friday. That amount represented the award plus interest.""We don't agree with how these international mechanisms work ... however, we are respectful and we fulfill our international obligations,"" Martinez added. The payment comes as leftist President Rafael Correa's government faces a cash crunch due to tumbling crude revenues in the Andean oil producer that is OPEC's smallest member. Ecuador also had to pay Occidental Petroleum Corp  roughly $980 million this year to compensate the company for seizing its oil field in 2006.The $112 million payment to Chevron is not part of a separate legal battle brought by a group of Ecuadorean villagers who claim Texaco caused billions of dollars in pollution damage when it began exploring oil deposits in the 1960s.Chevron continues to fight claims from the villagers, who have filed lawsuits in Canada, Brazil and Argentina seeking to enforce a $9 billion judgment rendered in Ecuador against Chevron.

500,"   By Alexandra Ulmer and Girish Gupta | CARACAS/BOGOTA  CARACAS/BOGOTA Even for Venezuela's notoriously opaque economy, it was a sweetheart deal that went too far.Last August, state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela SA issued one of its largest tenders in recent years: a multi-billion dollar project in the Orinoco Belt, the world's largest crude reserve. The project was designed to shore up the OPEC country's stagnating oil production and ease an economic crisis.Then, out of the blue, a tiny Colombian trucking and trading firm with no relevant experience beat global industry leaders to win the contract, worth around $4.5 billion according to one PDVSA [PDVSA.UL] document. Alarm bells rang among PDVSA's foreign partners, which include Chevron (CVX.N) and Rosneft (ROSN.MM).MORE FROM REUTERS The identity crisis that led to Yahoo's demiseBreakingviews: AB InBev adds dash of cynicism to raised SAB offerU.S. consumer confidence steady; new home sales near eight-and-a-half-year highTrenaco, headquartered in Switzerland but largely run out of Colombia, had edged out the world's top service companies — Halliburton (HAL.N), Schlumberger (SLB.N) and Weatherford (WFT.N) — after a series of meetings with top-level PDVSA executives in the six months before the contract was tendered.Certain it would obtain the huge contract to drill 600 wells, Trenaco began hiring staff and buying equipment months before winning the tender, according to four high-ranking sources from the now-liquidated company, as well as WhatsApp text and audio messages between senior staff reviewed by Reuters.In an unprecedented rebellion, however, foreign oil firms - which would have had to work with Trenaco as PDVSA's joint venture partners - protested that the company was vastly underqualified and undercapitalized, according to complaint letters sent to PDVSA last year, copies of which were seen by Reuters. Executives at companies that sent the letters showed them to Reuters on the condition that they not be identified as sources.The international companies also say they feared that getting involved in a massive public project anchored by a small and obscure contractor would expose themselves to regulatory scrutiny back home.""There were red flags everywhere,"" said one foreign joint venture partner in Caracas.In one complaint letter reviewed by Reuters, a multinational oil company wrote that Trenaco was ""not qualified technically or financially"" to handle the project.Despite PDVSA's attempts to persuade partners to accept the deal during joint venture meetings, the foreign companies refused to fold, and the agreement finally collapsed between December and January, according to joint venture partners.Venezuela's Oil Ministry, Information Ministry and PDVSA did not respond to detailed questions about the Trenaco project.Among PDVSA's joint venture partners, the United States' Chevron, India's ONGC Videsh (ONVI.BO), Russia's Rosneft, Spain's Repsol (REP.MC) and Japan's Inpex (1605.T) declined to comment. Japan's Mitsubishi Corp (8058.T) said it ""didn't complain about this deal,"" and had no further comment. Italy's Eni (ENI.MI), China's CNPC [CNPET.UL], India's Reliance Industries (RELI.NS), India's Oil India Ltd (OILI.NS) and Venezuela's Suelopetrol SPTb.CR did not respond to requests for comment. DYSFUNCTIONAL ECONOMY The doomed Trenaco deal highlights the opacity and dysfunction at PDVSA and in Venezuela's socialist-run economy.Cash-strapped Venezuela, home to the world's biggest oil reserves, is heaving under a third year of recession, acute food and medicine shortages, triple-digit inflation, and rampant violent crime. Looting and food riots are proliferating, with hungry mobs chanting, ""We want food!"" outside increasingly empty supermarkets. Reuters reviewed company documents and interviewed dozens of foreign and local oil executives, current and former PDVSA employees, union leaders, lawyers and politicians. The sources described a culture of corruption that ranges from the trivial - giving a gift to a secretary to land a meeting with a top PDVSA executive – to the systemic, such as funneling kickbacks in return for large contracts.The U.S. Justice Department has said there is a large, ongoing investigation into bribery at PDVSA. In perhaps the most damning case to date, U.S. authorities in December arrested two Venezuelan oil magnates, Roberto Rincon and Abraham Shiera, alleging they took part in a billion-dollar conspiracy to pay bribes to secure PDVSA contracts. Both men have pleaded guilty.Oil accounts for 94 percent of Venezuela's export revenues, and PDVSA is the financial motor of President Nicolas Maduro's government. The company originally criticized the Rincon-Shiera case as part of a wider U.S.-led conspiracy and ""smear campaign"" against socialism.But in its 2015 financial statement, published this month, PDVSA said an internal probe found it had been the ""victim of fraud,"" referring to the Rincon and Shiera case.""PDVSA does not tolerate acts of corruption and will continue investigating and acting with the aim of determining responsibilities,"" the company said.It listed a series of actions under way to prevent corruption, from new payment procedures and controls to an improved internal ethics code.Venezuela's economy has ebbed and flowed with the price of oil for a century, and allegations of corruption have been endemic in the industry here.The country's opposition says the problem has worsened under the populist socialist administrations of Maduro and his predecessor, the late Hugo Chavez. The opposition, now in control of the National Assembly, accuses authorities of stymieing probes into the company. HIGH-LEVEL MEETINGS The Trenaco deal began to take shape in early 2015, when a handful of top Trenaco executives took weekly trips by private jet to Caracas and were whisked in a convoy of armored vehicles to a reserved floor in the city's top Marriott hotel, said four senior Trenaco executives in Bogota. The visitors were in Caracas for meetings nearby at PDVSA's headquarters and Trenaco's local office. The four executives say a new boss had just taken the helm at Trenaco: Alex Saab, a 44-year-old businessman from Colombia's coastal city of Barranquilla.Saab, they say, was close to top figures in Maduro's government and had done business with authorities under Chavez. He also had connections with top people at PDVSA, they say.""Alex Saab had very good relations with the executives at PDVSA,"" said one senior Trenaco executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity.In November 2011, Saab signed an agreement on behalf of another of his ventures, a Bogota-based construction company named Fondo Global de Construccion, to build social housing for the Venezuelan government. He appeared on state television signing the deal alongside Chavez and Colombia's president, Juan Manuel Santos.Fondo Global's headquarters in Caracas are in the same building as Trenaco's, according to Venezuela's National Registry of Contractors database.Saab denies having anything to do with Trenaco. Neither Swiss corporate records nor hundreds of pages of Colombian registry records obtained by Reuters specify who owned Trenaco.""I am not and have never been an employee or shareholder in the company that you mention and for that reason I have nothing to say,"" Saab told Reuters in an exchange on the Whatsapp message service. He did not respond to a detailed set of follow-up questions.His lawyer, Colombian attorney Abelardo de la Espriella, said Trenaco executives had approached Saab to ""speak about business"" but Saab had no involvement with the company.Interviews and other evidence suggest otherwise. Four senior executives of the now-defunct company told Reuters that Saab was in full control of Trenaco. They showed Reuters internal Trenaco correspondence and audio files exchanged via WhatsApp in which Saab participated. Reuters authenticated Saab's number by successfully contacting him on the one used in the WhatsApp conversation.The four Trenaco executives say the company was run by Saab and two other men: Carlos Gutierrez, the son of a Colombian agricultural baron, and fellow Colombian businessman Alvaro Pulido. The trio took over the management of the company between 2012 and 2014, when Trenaco was seeking capital, the sources said. Details of the past and current ownership structure are obscure.Gutierrez did not respond to a request for comment. Reuters was unable to contact Pulido. MONEY-LAUNDERING PROBE Separately, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has been investigating companies owned by Saab and Pulido on suspicion of laundering money from illegal drug trafficking operations, mostly cocaine from Colombia, a U.S. law enforcement official told Reuters. The status of that investigation is unclear and it is possible that no charges will result.Saab didn't respond to a question about the DEA inquiry. Reuters was unable to contact Pulido.A PDVSA document from last year put the Trenaco project's price tag at some $4.5 billion, though people familiar with the matter said the value was later reduced.Once the PDVSA tender was published in August, Schlumberger, Halliburton and Weatherford requested an extension to the roughly two weeks allowed for proposals, the PDVSA document shows. Of the three firms, only Schlumberger ultimately submitted an offer, and it was disqualified by the tender committee.The Schlumberger proposal was shot down because it ""did not accept the conditions and terms of the type of contract,"" the document notes, without elaborating, and because Schlumberger's proposed financing scheme, which appeared to involve paying off dividends that PDVSA owes to the joint ventures, was deemed inadequate.At a time of low oil prices, sources at foreign companies said, PDVSA was keen that the contractor finance the project itself, as Trenaco had proposed.Schlumberger declined to comment. Halliburton said it had ""no additional information to add."" Weatherford did not respond to a request for comment.Foreign executives said they did not receive an explanation from PDVSA as to why the Trenaco deal fell through.Whatever the case, it was a death knell for the Colombian company. Trenaco went into liquidation in March, according to registry documents. The senior Trenaco executives attributed the company's shuttering to the collapse of the PDVSA deal.Even some government supporters are questioning the unpopular Maduro's management of the key oil sector.""We're 'Chavistas,' we're revolutionaries, but we're not idiots,"" said Johnny Jimenez, a PDVSA operator and union leader in Maracaibo. He said PDVSA has ignored union requests for worker-led audits. ""Why are they scared of an audit?""Worried about corruption and inefficiency, foreign companies in Venezuela say they are now vying for more control over the contracts they strike with PDVSA, decreasing the role of Bariven, PDVSA's procurement arm. But because PDVSA has a minimum 60 percent stake in joint ventures, the foreign partners usually cannot take full rein.Venezuela's resolve to clean up the industry may soon be put to a test. Sources in Caracas and Bogota say PDVSA is now preparing a new tender to drill oil wells in the Orinoco.In the meantime, Caracas-based foreign executives complain that PDVSA has been signing unexpected contracts with new, inexperienced companies seen as close to the Venezuelan oil giant. In one case, a source at a foreign company said, workers were renting lights from a contractor to illuminate oil fields - during the daytime. (Reporting by Alexandra Ulmer in Caracas and Girish Gupta in Bogota.

As a result, Hess slashed its production outlook from the Tubular project to about 10,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d) for the year, down from previous estimates for at least 25,000 boe/d.""It relates to some quality control and some of the components of the valve,"" Hill said.He did not say if Hess had filed a lawsuit or was seeking arbitration. Hess said it expects the platform to be fully back online later this year.Hess holds a stake of about 57 percent in the Tubular project, with Chevron holding the rest. Chevron was not immediately available for comment.Earlier on Wednesday, Hess reported a smaller-than-expected quarterly loss, but cut its 2016 budget, citing depressed crude prices.Shares of Hess fell 5.5 percent to $50.77 in Wednesday midday trading. Shares of Schlumberger fell 0.9 percent to $79.93.

Italian oil firm Eni's Jangkrik project is 80 percent complete and is expected to commence operation in July 2017, he said.Both projects are located in the Kutai Basin offshore East Kalimantan province where several projects are being planned under the name of the Indonesia Deepwater Development (IDD).Two other IDD projects - Chevron's Gendalo-Gehem and Eni's Merakes - have been put on hold after oil and gas prices fell  LNG-AS, Puja said. The Indonesian government is in talks with the companies on providing more incentives to raise the internal rate of return for the deepwater projects to at least 25 percent, up from 10 to 15 percent currently, Puja said.The companies have proposed incentives that include extending the length of the production sharing contracts for the deepwater projects beyond the initial 30 years because of their complexity and a longer exemption period for being obligated to sell to the domestic market. ""We're still discussing it. It's not decided yet,"" Puja said.Chevron has a 62 percent interest in the Bangka project, according to its website. The project has a design capacity of 115 million cubic feet of natural gas and 4,000 barrels per day (bpd) of condensate, a light oil typically produced in association with gas.The Jangkrik project, which Eni holds a 55 percent stake, is expected to produce 450 million cubic feet of natural gas and 4,400 bpd of condensate, according to the project contractor Saipem's website.Separately, Indonesia has offered 17 oil and gas blocks in an auction this year, including the deepwater Surumana block, Puja said.(Reporting by Wilda Asmarini; Writing by Florence Tan; Editing by Richard Pullin and Christian Schmollinger)",2016-07-29,CVX,"Fri Jul 29, 2016 | 5:32am EDT",UPDATE 1-Indonesia to start natural gas output from two deepwater fields,http://www.reuters.com//article/indonesia-gas-idUSL4N1AF31S?type=companyNews

522,"   By Jonathan Stempel | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Chevron Corp persuaded a federal appeals court on Monday to block enforcement in the United States of an $8.65 billion Ecuadorean pollution judgment that it said, and which the court agreed, was obtained through bribery and fraud.The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan upheld a lower court ruling against the American lawyer Steven Donziger, who has spent more than two decades battling Chevron to hold it responsible for pollution in the Ecuadorean rain forest.""Even innocent clients may not benefit from the fraud of their attorney,"" Circuit Judge Amalya Kearse wrote for a three-judge panel in a 127-page decision.Monday's decision is unlikely to end the legal war against San Ramon, California-based Chevron, which has been waged in several countries and was documented in ""Crude,"" a 2009 film.""The decision hands well-heeled corporations a template for avoiding legal accountability anywhere in the world,"" Deepak Gupta, a lawyer for Donziger, said in a statement. ""We will be exploring all available options for further review.""R. Hewitt Pate, Chevron's general counsel, said in a statement the decision ""leaves no doubt that the Ecuadorean judgment against Chevron is the illegitimate and unenforceable product of misconduct."" Donziger and representatives of residents of Ecuador's Lago Agrio region have sought to force Chevron to pay for water and soil contamination caused from 1964 to 1992 by Texaco, which Chevron acquired in 2001.While not disputing that pollution occurred, Chevron has said Donziger and his associates went too far, including by arranging the ghostwriting of a key environmental report and bribing the presiding judge in Ecuador.The oil company has also said a 1998 agreement between Texaco and Ecuador absolved it of further liability. In March 2014, U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan in Manhattan barred enforcement of the 2011 judgment, citing the corruption used to obtain it.Kearse, in Monday's decision, said the record reveals ""a parade of corrupt actions"" by Donziger and his associates, including coercion and fraud, culminating in the bribe offer.""Chevron's $8.646 billion judgment debt ... is clearly traceable to the Lago Agrio plaintiffs' legal team's corrupt conduct,"" Kearse wrote. Donziger has also tried to enforce the judgment in Canada, Brazil and other countries where Chevron operates.Karen Hinton, a spokeswoman for the Ecuadorean residents, in a statement said their lawyers may also appeal, and will continue litigation in Canada and other countries to seize Chevron assets.The case is Chevron Corp v.

PTTEP operates the Bongkot gas field. Contracts for the two offshore fields are due to expire in 2022 and 2023.They have combined production of 2.2 billion cubic feet per day, or 76 percent of output in the Gulf of Thailand.Thai authorities are drafting terms and criteria for the auction, which is expected to be completed by the end of this year, Veerasak Pungrassamee, director general of the ministry's Department of Mineral Fuels, told reporters. The winners will be announced in September next year, he said, adding legislators will take three months to amend the energy law, one month longer than planned to make sure of continuity in production. PTTEP, Thailand's largest oil and gas explorer, has said it will bid to operate the Bongkot field. Chevron said it was committed to its Thailand investments, despite job cuts that have led to rumours of its exit.Veerasak said the energy ministry also planned to hold a long-delayed auction for new oil concessions in late 2017. The military government put off a bidding round of  concessions for 29 onshore and offshore blocks in early 2015 due to criticism of contract terms from politicians and activists.The round was originally planned for 2011 but was on hold after devastating floods that year and then a political crisis that began in late 2013 and culminated in a military coup in May 2014.

539,"   By Alexandra Ulmer, Marianna Parraga and Girish Gupta | CARACAS/HOUSTON  CARACAS/HOUSTON Venezuela's state oil company PDVSA said on Wednesday it has awarded $3.2 billion in contracts to drill wells in the Orinoco Belt, although sources close to the matter said some foreign partners had complaints the tender was rushed and there were structural problems that could hinder projects.The fresh discontent comes after Reuters reported in July that tiny Colombian trucking firm Trenaco, whose management was close to Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, won a multibillion-dollar contract to carry out similar work despite having no relevant experience.In a rare rebellion, foreign companies protested to PDVSA that Trenaco was vastly underqualified, leading to the cancellation of the $4.5 billion deal amid concerns about transparency and political favoritism.In a similar tender renewed this year, Schlumberger NV, Oklahoma-based Horizontal Well Drillers and Venezuelan contractor Y&V won contracts to drill a total of 480 wells at three joint ventures between PDVSA [PDVSA.UL] and foreign partners. The projects are designed to add 250,000 barrels per day (bpd) in 30 months, PDVSA said, as the crisis-hit OPEC country's production slips due to low investment, maintenance problems, limited diluent imports, theft, and a brain drain.""Investment amounts to $3.2 billion, which demonstrates the strength of PDVSA and shows trust in the national oil company,"" PDVSA said in a statement. But some of PDVSA's foreign partners are questioning or outright protesting over how the deals were conducted, according to interviews with half a dozen sources at foreign oil companies and service firms.""We're going to fight this,"" said a source at a foreign company.The sources declined to be identified to avoid compromising business in Venezuela. PDVSA did not respond to a request for comment about the complaints. UNANSWERED QUESTIONS Sources said PDVSA failed to provide enough details on the contracts, which in some cases were only approved by PDVSA's simple majority in the joint ventures.  Hurt by low oil prices and a steep recession at home, PDVSA asked bidders to provide financing themselves and be repaid in future oil production, according to PDVSA documents seen by Reuters, but the winners include relatively small service companies. Some of the foreign partners also deemed the cost per well, at around $6.5 million dollars, too high, sources said. Other sources questioned why PDVSA would boost extra-heavy crude output when it does not have sufficient blending components or infrastructure to turn tar-like Orinoco oil into lighter crude that can be easily sold on global markets. PDVSA's cash-flow problems have at times left it unable to pay for sufficient diluent.The joint ventures' early production for this is expected to come online for mid-2017.  FINE PRINT After the Trenaco episode caused friction with partners, PDVSA revived the sunk deal but separated it into six four-year contracts of around 100 wells each.Schlumberger and Y&V won the two contracts to drill some 200 wells at the Petrovictoria joint venture, where Russia's Rosneft has a 40 percent stake, one source said. A separate source said Schlumberger, the world's largest oil services company, has scaled back Venezuelan operations because PDVSA owes it money, and is securing external financing for the project. In an e-mail to Reuters, Schlumberger confirmed the deal to construct 80 wells, adding ""the details for the commercial terms including the collections assurance mechanism are still under negotiation."" Horizontal Well Drillers won some $1.29 billion worth of contracts to drill 191 wells at Petroindependencia, whose minority partners include Chevron Corp, Venezuela's Suelopetrol, and Japanese companies Mitsubishi Corp and Inpex Corp, a PDVSA document shows.  Horizontal Well Drillers has a 48-month credit line from Canada's Callidus Capital for $350 million to finance the project, the document shows. Callidus Capital, which describes itself as offering ""creative funding solutions to companies that cannot access traditional lending sources,"" did not respond to an email seeking comment. In an email to Reuters, Horizontal Well Drillers said it won the contract ""in large part because the shallow Venezuelan formations are ideally suited for the company's rigs.""Y&V won one contract worth $647 million to drill 100 wells at Petrocarabobo, which includes Spain's Repsol SA and India's ONGC Videsh, a separate PDVSA document shows.PDVSA's joint venture partners did not respond to requests for comment.The contractors ""will have the support and operational expertise of Halliburton and Baker Hughes for specific project activities; 18 drilling rigs will be available,"" PDVSA added in its statement. The second of two contracts at Petrocarabobo was not awarded because no valid bid was received, two sources said. Y&V has secured a credit line from commodities trader Burj Petroleum Corporation for up to $250 million, according to the PDVSA document.Burj Petroleum, a crude and products trading company, did not respond to a request for comment.

544,"   By Dan Levine | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Carl Ferrer, chief executive of advertising website Backpage.com, was arrested on Thursday on criminal charges including pimping, as authorities investigate the company which has been accused of facilitating sex trafficking of minors.The attorneys general of Texas and California said in a statement that Ferrer had been taken into custody in Houston on a California warrant.Backpage, the second-largest U.S. online classified ad service after Craigslist, has faced scrutiny from the U.S. Senate as well as civil lawsuits over allegations that the site facilitates sex trafficking, especially of children.Kristin Ford, a spokeswoman for California Attorney General Kamala Harris, said Ferrer would appear in a Texas court for an extradition hearing unless he waives it.Attorneys for Backpage.com could not immediately be reached for comment. Harris also announced a criminal charge on Thursday against the controlling shareholders of Backpage.com, Michael Lacey and James Larkin. Ford said warrants have been issued for Lacey and Larkin but they are not in custody.The California AG office said it had conducted a three-year investigation, including undercover operations posting escort ads. The Senate voted 96-0 earlier this year to hold Backpage in civil contempt after it did not comply with a subpoena to hand over documents explaining how it combats sex trafficking in ads on the adult section of its website. One civil lawsuit against Backpage was filed in 2012 in Washington State by three young teenagers who alleged they were raped multiple times after being advertised on the site. The girls, the oldest of whom was 15, sued Backpage for claims including sexual exploitation of children, alleging its posting rules were intended to instruct pimps how to post trafficking ads that evade law enforcement.Backpage argued its rules are meant to prevent unlawful posts and invoked the federal Communications Decency Act, asserting they are not responsible for the ads because they were third-party content. Some free speech advocates filed briefs in support of its position. The Washington state Supreme Court disagreed, ruling last year that the lawsuit could go forward.Earlier this year, however, a similar trafficking case involving children against Backpage in Massachusetts was dismissed by a federal appeals court, which said the free speech principles embodied in the Communications Decency Act were paramount.

554,"   By Ernest Scheyder | RICHMOND, Calif.  RICHMOND, Calif. The land of liberal politics, electric cars and strict pollution controls might seem like an odd place to drop $1 billion into a 115-year-old oil refinery.Chevron Corp sees an entirely different landscape in California: a uniquely isolated market, closed to new competitors, where the price of gasoline can skyrocket when even one refinery goes down.The company plans to make a fortune here - in part from the expected misfortunes of rival refineries in the state, who after Chevron's renovations will have older technologies and potentially more frequent outages. The $1 billion investment will go into Chevron's refinery in Richmond, an industrial city northeast of San Francisco. Analysts said the renovations, started this summer and scheduled for completion by 2019, will likely make the plant more reliable than the 13 other refineries operating in a state with high and volatile gasoline prices.That means Chevron may be well-positioned to profit from rivals' breakdowns, such as the February 2015 explosion at Exxon Mobil's refinery in Torrance. The outage kept the refinery from returning to full capacity for more than a year and pushed state gasoline prices to an 18-month high, boosting margins for other state refineries.Outages aside, Chevron also stands to profit from serving the California gasoline market, the world's third largest, behind only the rest of the United States and China.""Californians like clean air, and they like helping the environment,"" said Dave Hackett, a refinery analyst at Stillwater Associates. ""But at the end of the day, they're not going to give up their cars.""For a graphic showing surging gasoline use in California, see: tmsnrt.rs/2ePvIRsThe state’s thicket of fossil-fuel regulations has an upside for companies that can navigate it - most notably, a near certainty that no new competitors will open in California, which had more than twice as many refineries in the mid-1980s. That trend may continue. Among the state’s ambitious clean air goals is Governor Jerry Brown’s target of generating half of California’s power from renewable sources by 2030.'INSULATED MARKET'  California is also the nation’s largest auto market and an island of expensive retail gasoline.California’s pump prices are the highest in the contiguous United States because the state requires a one-off blend to curb smog, which few refineries produce. Gasoline refined in nearby Washington state, for instance, can't be sold in California.Transportation costs also drive up gas prices. With no gasoline pipelines flowing into the state, fuel must be shipped by truck or boat.    ""To be a refiner in California is difficult and tough, but it can also be lucrative,"" said John Auers, a refinery industry consultant with Turner Mason. ""It's an insulated market, and that protects your margins.”Amid the high prices, California Attorney General Kamala Harris launched a probe earlier this year into whether Chevron and other state refiners have manipulated gasoline prices. The companies deny the charges. Investigators are specifically examining price hikes during periods of refinery outages, according to a subpoena from Harris, who is also a U.S. Senate candidate. Chevron has said it will cooperate with the investigation.Chevron’s Richmond refinery is the state’s largest producer of jet fuel, supplying San Francisco's airport at a time when air travel demand continues to soar.  ""Clearly, we see continued opportunity within California,"" said Joe Naylor, Chevron's vice president for policy, government and public affairs. The refinery renovation, he said, ""is a sign that we remain committed to being in California as long as the business environment remains conducive to us."" Chevron declined to detail expected margins for the Richmond plant, but said it expects to recoup its investment.BICYCLES IN BEVERLY HILLS? Brown signed a law two months ago that aims to cut California's greenhouse gas emissions to 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030. The bill was unpopular among the state's oil companies who claimed it would push up consumer gas prices, which already average 57 cents more per gallon than the U.S., according to AAA, a nonprofit association of U.S. travel clubs. Chevron's refinery, however, will meet or exceed California's emissions, safety and other environmental standards, the company said.Chevron is replacing its refinery's antiquated hydrogen plant - a crucial component for a refinery - and installing new hydrogen-purifying equipment and building a new cogeneration power plant, which uses heat from the refining process to generate electricity, lowering Chevron's power costs.    In Richmond, a city of roughly 100,000 that was a major shipbuilding port during World War Two, residents who had fought Chevron's Richmond expansion efforts.Environmental groups cited a refinery fire in 2012 at the Richmond plant in arguing that Chevron cannot safely operate the plant in a densely populated region.    Chevron rejects that criticism.    ""If we look at the operation of our facilities around the world, I would stack our record up against anybody,"" said Naylor, the Chevron executive.California's political and regulatory environment has driven other oil giants away from the state. Exxon sold its Torrance refinery - its only California refinery - to PBF Energy last summer for $537 million, saying the sale was part of a ""strategic assessment of the site and how it fits with our refining portfolio."" Oil producer Occidental Petroleum Corp fled California in 2014 for Texas, well known for its business-friendly policies.""Maybe the people in Beverly Hills should park their Rolls Royces and drive bicycles going forward,"" Steve Chazen, then-CEO of Oxy said in early 2014 when detailing the company's exit from the state and describing his frustration with its energy regulations. But while others may leave, Chevron's rival California refiners see opportunity as well. Tom O'Malley, CEO of PBF Energy, called California ""a very attractive market,"" and noted the company bought Exxon's Torrance refinery ""at a very attractive purchase price.""Phillips 66, which owns two California refineries, told investors earlier this year that demand in California for gasoline continues to rise. Company Chief Executive Greg Garland put it this way: ""Margins have been very good in California.""

560,"   By Jonathan Stempel  The court-appointed trustee liquidating Bernard Madoff's firm said on Friday he has reached a settlement with the family of late Beverly Hills money manager Stanley Chais that will provide more than $277 million to victims of Madoff's Ponzi scheme.Irving Picard, the trustee, said victims will receive at least $232 million of cash, and the rights to $30.7 million of assets that are expected to be sold.A separate $15 million fund will pay claims by California investors, resolving litigation by that state's Attorney General Kamala Harris, and which had been brought in 2009 by her predecessor, California Governor Jerry Brown.Friday's settlement requires approval by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Stuart Bernstein in Manhattan, who oversees the liquidation of Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC. A hearing is scheduled for Nov. 22.The cash payout would boost to $11.46 billion the sum that Picard has recovered for former Madoff customers, or 65 percent of their estimated $17.5 billion loss. Picard has said half of the 2,597 accounts with valid claims have been fully paid off.Madoff, 78, is serving a 150-year prison term after pleading guilty to running a decades-long fraud uncovered in December 2008. Chais, who died in September 2010 at the age of 84, once handled investments for elite Hollywood clients like Oscar-winning director Steven Spielberg, and had been a close friend of Madoff since the 1960s. Picard had sought to recoup $1.32 billion of ""fictitious profits"" that he claimed the Chais defendants, including Chais' widow Pamela, withdrew from Madoff's firm.The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in June 2009 filed a related civil lawsuit against Chais, claiming he ignored red flags that Madoff's seemingly steady returns were bogus. In a court filing, Picard's lawyers said the settlement covered all of Stanley Chais' estate and substantially all of his widow's assets, and represented ""a good faith, complete and total compromise.""Chais had maintained that he was also a Madoff victim and had lost nearly all of his own money.Lawyers for the Chais defendants did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Through Sept. 30, more than $1.42 billion has been spent on recovery efforts, including $824.6 million for legal fees for Picard's law firm Baker & Hostetler and $370.2 million for consultant fees, a Thursday court filing shows.A $4 billion fund overseen by former SEC Chairman Richard Breeden will also compensate Madoff victims.The cases are Picard v Chais et al, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York, No. 09-ap-01172; and In re: Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC in the same court, No. 08-01789.

570,"   By Juliana Castilla | BUENOS AIRES  BUENOS AIRES Argentina's government is negotiating more flexible oil workers' contracts to woo investors to the Vaca Muerta shale fields and overcome an energy deficit, the head of one of the sector's most powerful unions told Reuters on Monday.High labor costs are thought to be the primary obstacle to investment in the country's oil and gas sector, and negotiations are politically sensitive in a country with an influential labor movement, meaning some changes are off the table.""Negotiations are advanced, I'd say 80 percent, but the union will not budge on job security for workers,"" Guillermo Pereyra, General Secretary of the private oil and gas union in Rio Negro, Neuquen and La Pampa, and Senator for the province of Neuquen, said in an interview.Argentine Production Minister Francisco Cabrera told reporters in Washington last week that state-controlled energy company YPF (YPFD.BA) and unions were holding labor talks ""because it is impossible to be productive.""An agreement would allow companies to stop paying workers for commuting time, or so-called taxi hours, and would allow some workers to be hired only for short-term projects. Vaca Muerta in southern Argentina, one of the world's largest shale reserves at some 30,000 square kilometers, has attracted investment from Chevron (CVX.N) and Exxon (XOM.N), but remains largely unexplored. Argentina's unions became more demanding in the days of $100-per-barrel oil, and have been resistant to change, making companies like BP (BP.L) say they need to see more flexibility in labor laws before committing investments.It is not clear if the labor agreement will be enough to interest new companies. ""We got to the point where we had so many strikes and conflicts that we could not even work,"" the director of one company operating in Patagonia said on condition of anonymity.New technology should allow drilling with a team of 16 workers, but the unions require companies to continue to employ 25 workers, the director said as an example. On top of drilling costs, companies have to make a 10 percent contribution for ""social peace,"" a subsidy for out-of-work oil workers. Some companies report up to 60 percent of their employees are frequently absent.Daniel Gonzalez, financial director of YPF, said recently the company's production was affected by two strikes this year.""We continue projecting stable output for the year, but it could be negatively affected by more labor conflicts,"" he said.

571,"   By Ruma Paul | DHAKA  DHAKA Bangladesh is considering buying Chevron Corp's (CVX.N) interest in three natural gas fields in the country, worth an estimated $2 billion, two senior government officials said, as Dhaka looks to secure the supply of a critical source of energy. Chevron, the second-largest U.S.-based oil producer, said in October last year that it plans to sell about $10 billion of assets by 2017 amid a prolonged slump in energy prices. Chevron recently said it is in discussions about the potential sale of three fields it operates in the northeast of Bangladesh. Dhaka sees the gas fields, which account for more than half of the country's production, as a matter of ""national interest"" and a purchase is on the table, said Istiaque Ahmad, chairman of Petrobangla, the state-owned oil and gas company, on Thursday. He added, however, that their efforts were at a preliminary stage.Ahmad said Petrobangla was waiting for Chevron to approach it about a bid. Petrobangla is also likely to appoint a consultancy firm to assess the assets, including proven and recoverable gas reserves, to arrive at a valuation, he said.A Chevron spokesman said the company has been in commercial discussions about its assets but no decision had been made so far to sell them.  ""We will only proceed if we can realize attractive value for Chevron,"" the spokesman said in an emailed statement on Monday. Bangladesh officials have said that the South Asian nation of 160 million needs more energy to realize its vision of becoming a middle-income country by 2021. The country is currently short of about 500 million cubic feet a day of gas, according to the energy ministry. Bangladesh will buy the assets through an open bidding process, a government source said last week. ""Why should we hand it over to someone else?"" the source said.     Dhaka's interest would likely make it harder for a third-party to buy the assets. The Chevron unit sells its entire output from the three fields to Petrobangla under a production sharing contract. Under the terms of the contract, the Bangladesh government has the right of first refusal in any asset sale, Mohammad Hussain Monsur, former Petrobangla chairman, said on Monday. Monsur also said that funding the purchase of the assets would not be a problem since the country could rely on its foreign exchange reserves, which stand at more than $31 billion.    In 2015, Chevron's net daily production in the country averaged 720 million cubic feet of natural gas and 3,000 barrels of condensate, accounting for more than half the gas production in Bangladesh.

574,"   By Ron Bousso and Karolin Schaps | LONDON  LONDON Royal Dutch Shell and BP on Tuesday joined peers in reporting higher than expected earnings by making further deep cuts in spending to cope with an oil price downturn now in its third year.The companies said they were well on the way to adapting to the more than halving in prices. But any new sharper downturn would test their ability to invest for growth and retain the relatively large dividends their shareholders expect.Shell's stock rose by over 4 percent as it announced higher quarterly earnings than arch-rival U.S. Exxon Mobil, the world's largest listed oil company by output and market capitalization.The Anglo-Dutch major, which acquired rival BG for $54 billion earlier this year, had been under pressure to cut costs after second quarter earnings came in around 50 percent below forecasts.By contrast, BP's stock fell by more than 4 percent by 1210 ET as some analysts said its results were boosted by a one-off tax gain, meaning its longer-term profits and ability to pay dividends could still be at risk. The oil price was trading flat on the day at around $49 a barrel.Shell's Chief Executive Officer Ben van Beurden said the oil sector had yet to emerge from troubled waters, but huge cost savings meant oil majors were getting closer to balancing their operations at today's oil prices of around $50 a barrel.The prospects for an oil price recovery are still unclear, van Beurden said, despite attempts by OPEC and other producers to agree a deal to limit output and reduce the global glut which has pushed oil prices down by 50 percent since June 2014.""Lower oil prices continue to be a significant challenge across the business, and the outlook remains uncertain,"" van Beurden said. FUTURE FOCUS The world's top oil and gas companies, including Exxon and Chevron, reported sharp drops in quarterly results last week due to lower oil prices and weaker refining margins.But at the same time, most have shown they were adjusting to the new environment, with both Exxon and Chevron also beating earnings expectations. Chevron plans to focus future growth on U.S. onshore shale production, where investments are smaller and production starts faster compared to large offshore projects.Shell also sees shale production as a key future growth engine. Its Chief Financial Officer Simon Henry said the oil-rich Permian Basin in West Texas was a ""crown jewel"".Exxon warned it may need to slash proved oil and gas reserves on its books by nearly 20 percent, or some 4.6 billion barrels, if oil prices stay low for the rest of 2016. French oil major Total also beat third quarter income expectations helped by cost cuts and new projects and only smaller rivals Norway's Statoil and Italy's ENI missed expectations due to lower-than-expected output.     BP Chief Financial Officer Brian Gilvary said the British company was on track to rebalance cash flows next year at $50 to $55 a barrel and its future focus areas would include Russia and areas where it could bring technology to bear.""This allow us to sustain our dividend whilst still investing enough to grow long term,"" he said.In 2014, the world's top oil companies required an oil price of $113 a barrel in order to cover their spending and dividends, according to Jefferies analysts. The breakeven dropped to around $60 a barrel in 2016 and is expected to hover at around $50 a barrel next year.BP benefited from UK fiscal regime changes, resulting an a $164 million tax credit in the third quarter, compared with a $1.16 billion tax bill in the same quarter last year. ""Despite mixed numbers and a modest increase in gearing, the overall trend in cost and capex savings and cash flows at BP continues to head in the right direction,"" analysts from Morgan Stanley said in a note. BP reported a near halving in third-quarter earnings and slashed another $1 billion from its 2016 investment plan, while Shell saw an 18 percent rise in profits and lowered next year's capital spending to the bottom of the expected range.Both Shell and BP maintained their dividends unchanged as expected.At $2.8 billion in the third quarter, Shell's net income was above Exxon's third quarter net income of $2.65 billion. Exxon has not made a big acquisition for more than 5 years but it is still worth more than Shell - its market cap was $345 billion as of Tuesday while Shell was worth $205 billion. As well as slashing spending, oil companies have scrapped new projects, cut tens of thousands of jobs, renegotiated supply contracts and increased borrowing since prices began a sustained fall in June 2014.All the majors apart from Eni have maintained or increased their dividends throughout the downturn to retain shareholder loyalty. Shell has not cut its dividend since World War Two.

580,"  (Updates with Chevron comment, background)Nov 14 Production at Chevron Corp's $54 billion Gorgon liquefied natural gas (LNG) export project has safely resumed operations following a temporary shutdown last week, a company spokesman said on Monday.The stoppage was the third to hit the project since it started up in March, limiting output at a time of rising although still relatively low spot LNG prices. The plant was shut as part of a brief unplanned outage that delayed a handful of shipments but there were no cancellations, trade sources said on Friday. Chevron spokesman Cam Van Ast said in an email on Friday that production at Gorgon LNG Train 1 had been temporarily halted for minor maintenance but that restart activities were under way. Output from the plant's second production line, known as Train 2, was unaffected and continues to ramp up, he said.(Reporting by Oleg Vukmanovic in Milan; editing by David Goodman and Jason Neely)",2016-11-14,CVX,"Mon Nov 14, 2016 | 4:23am EST",UPDATE 1-Chevron's Gorgon LNG resumes production after brief outage,http://www.reuters.com//article/chevron-gorgon-idUSL8N1DF2E3?type=companyNews
