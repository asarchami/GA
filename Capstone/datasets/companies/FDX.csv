0,"   By Maria Kiselyova and Olga Sichkar | MOSCOW  MOSCOW Express delivery companies DHL and FedEx (FDX.N) said on Thursday they had suspended foreign shipments to individual customers in Russia because of stricter customs procedures, making it harder for internet users to buy goods from abroad.President Vladimir Putin ordered a campaign late last year to ""put into order"" a booming e-commerce sector. One of the proposed measures was lowering a value threshold for purchases in foreign online stores that are subject to customs duty.According to DHL Express, part of Deutsche Post (DPWGn.DE), Russian authorities from January 2014 expanded the list of documents required to ship goods to individual customers, which has significantly slowed customs clearance.DHL will suspend all shipments of goods for personal use to Russia from January 27, the company said in emailed comments, after already suspending most such imports already in 2010. A Moscow call-centre operator for FedEx said shipments to individual customers in Russia were ""temporarily suspended"". The FedEx press office was not immediately available for comment.According to a draft letter to clients from Russia's Association of Express Carriers, seen by Reuters, other providers such as UPS (UPS.N), TNT TNTE.AS, and DPD also decided to suspend imports.

9,"   By Chuck Mikolajczak | NEW YORK  NEW YORK U.S. stocks fell on Wednesday after comments from Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen raised the possibility of an earlier- than-anticipated increase in interest rates.The central bank dropped the U.S. unemployment rate as its definitive yardstick for gauging the economy's strength and made clear it would rely on a wide range of measures in deciding when to raise interest rates.Equities extended declines after Fed Chair Janet Yellen said the ""considerable period"" between the end of its quantitative easing program, known as QE, and the first rate increase from the central bank could be six months.With QE forecast to wind down sometime near the end of the year, a six-month lag would move up the timetable for the Fed's first hike, which many market participants had been expecting in the second half of 2015.""She certainly moved it up a little bit, and I don't think the market was expecting that at all because she is widely viewed as being more on the dovish side of the aisle than she is on the hawkish side,"" said Peter Kenny, CEO of Clearpool Group in New York. ""That is not a particularly hawkish comment, but the fact of the matter is, it was not expected.""The Fed also said it would cut its monthly purchases of U.S. Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities to $55 billion, from $65 billion.The S&P 500 was within 1 percent of its record closing high, though economic bellwether FedEx Corp (FDX.N) hit a sour note in its outlook. Geopolitical concerns related to Ukraine also stayed in focus. FedEx posted results below expectations and gave a weak full-year profit forecast, but the package shipper said it had been significantly hurt by winter storms, and the stock slipped 0.1 percent to close at $138.38.The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI fell 114.02 points or 0.70 percent, to end at 16,222.17. The S&P 500 .SPX slipped 11.48 points or 0.61 percent, to finish at 1,860.77. The Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 25.711 points or 0.59 percent, to close at 4,307.602.Equities had rallied to start the week, buoyed by easing geopolitical concerns, though trading volume has been light. The S&P 500 .SPX has climbed 1.7 percent over the previous two days, the best back-to-back performance for the benchmark index since early February. First Solar Inc (FSLR.O) surged 20.6 percent to $69.40 and ranked as the S&P 500's best performer after the company forecast a rise of up to 21 percent in revenue this year. First Solar also said it was developing cost-effective solar plants with General Electric Co (GE.N).Volume was light, with about 6 billion shares traded on U.S. exchanges, below the 6.7 billion average so far this month, according to data from BATS Global Markets.Volume is expected to surge on Friday as options expiration takes place alongside multiple index rebalances.

10,"   By Nivedita Bhattacharjee  FedEx Corp (FDX.N) on Wednesday said severe winter conditions had hurt quarterly earnings and revenue, prompting the world's No. 2 package delivery company to cut its fiscal-year profit forecast.The unusual weather disrupted operations, reduced shipping volumes and increased costs, decreasing operating income by about $125 million in the third quarter ended on February 28, FedEx said.But the company also said it was on track with its plan to improve earnings at the FedEx Express air delivery unit by $1.6 billion by the end of 2016.FedEx reported earnings of $378 million, or $1.23 a share, compared with $361 million, or $1.13 a share, a year earlier. Analysts on average were expecting $1.45 a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Revenue rose 3 percent to $11.3 billion, missing forecasts of $11.43 billion.The company said it expected to earn $6.55 to $6.80 a share for the year, down from its earlier outlook of $6.73 to $7.10.Analysts had forecast $6.89.While analysts expected weather conditions to hurt FedEx, it was difficult to estimate the financial impact without interim data, said Morningstar analyst Keith Schoonmaker.Shares of FedEx were down 0.4 percent at $137.99 in afternoon trading. ""While we were disappointed with the third-quarter earnings miss, the shortfall was due to weather-related costs,"" Deutsche Bank analyst Justin Yagerman wrote in a note to clients. ""FedEx remains one of our favorite ways to benefit from an improving economy.""FedEx's numbers provide the first real look at the impact the brutal winter had on the shipping industry.

McDonald's Corp (MCD.N) partly blamed a fall in January sales at its established U.S. restaurants on the frigid cold and snow, while vitamin and nutritional supplements retailer GNC Holdings Inc (GNC.N) warned that its first-quarter results would miss expectations for that reason.Ford Motor Co (F.N), railroad operator CSX Corp CSX.N and air carrier United Continental Holdings Inc (UAL.N) have also said the weather was affecting operations in the first quarter. During the third quarter, FedEx entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement to buy back an aggregate of $2.0 billion of common stock.TWITTER TALES The third-quarter results benefited from Cyber Week, a heavy online shopping period that had fallen in the second quarter last year, as well as from one additional operating day, the company said.However, problems stemming from the harsh winter overshadowed those benefits.Apart from bad weather, FedEx, like bigger rival United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N), was also hit by an unprecedented surge in online holiday shipping volumes. Typically, a rise in online sales is good news for companies like these because it means more demand for their services. But this time, UPS said it had been overwhelmed by the volume of holiday packages. The arrival of Christmas presents around the globe was delayed, and angry customers took to social websites to complain.However, on a conference call with analysts, FedEx Chief Executive Officer Frederick Smith said the company was able to handle a rise in volumes and that social media might have blown the problems out of proportion.""We live in a world where Twitter and social media makes anecdotes,"" Smith said. ""That was the big difference.""While an increase in e-commerce was helpful to FedEx, he said, many shippers did not have the ability to handle last-minute orders, which added to the holiday delivery congestion.Many industry experts think shoppers are more comfortable with making online purchases at the last minute because large online retailers like Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) can deliver the orders in one or two days.

14,"  New York state joined New York City in suing FedEx Corp for allegedly violating state and federal laws by delivering untaxed cigarettes, but the company said customer privacy prevented it from checking packages without reason.New York City accused FedEx of creating a ""public nuisance"" through its partnership with Shinnecock Smoke Shop to ship untaxed cigarettes to homes.An amended complaint filed on Sunday included New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman among the plaintiffs seeking more than $239 million in damages and penalties.""Not only has FedEx cheated the state out of millions in tax dollars - but many of these cigarettes may have ended up in the hands of teenagers, who are particularly vulnerable to low-priced cigarettes,"" Schneiderman said in a statement. (r.reuters.com/hex97v)New York state alleged that FedEx knowingly shipped nearly 400,000 cartons of unstamped cigarettes to homes in the state, depriving it of $15, $27.50 or $43.50 on each carton in tax revenue. FedEx said the case lacked legal foundation. The company said it had to protect the privacy of customers and would not open packages to determine their contents without reason.""While the lawsuit identifies several shippers of untaxed cigarettes with which we stopped doing business, those shippers are not being sued in the case, nor are any recipients who evaded paying applicable taxes,"" FedEx spokesman Perry Colosimo said in a statement emailed to Reuters.

17,"  (Adds NTSB saying bus tracking module likely destroyed, paragraphs 12-16)By Sharon BernsteinSACRAMENTO, Calif., April 12 Investigators were focusing on Saturday on what caused a FedEx tractor-trailer to collide with a bus in a fiery crash in northern California that killed 10 people, five of them teenage students en route to a college recruitment event.It remained unclear whether the FedEx driver was somehow distracted or lost consciousness, or whether a mechanical failure occurred when his truck swerved across the median of Interstate 5 and slammed head-on into the motor coach full of students from the Los Angeles area on Thursday evening.The California Highway Patrol also raised the possibility that a separate collision on the truck's side of the highway might have been a factor. Early highway patrol accounts of the accident said the truck side-swiped a car after crossing the center divider, before hitting the bus.Two witnesses, Bonnie and Joe Duran, who were reported to be in the clipped car, told California media outlets that the truck was on fire before the collision.""I was heading along in the outside lane and I looked over and saw the FedEx truck coming straight for me and he was in flames already,"" Bonnie Duran told a local CBS television affiliate.Reuters could not immediately contact the Durans and a California Highway Patrol spokeswoman did not immediately respond to requests for comment.A powerful explosion unleashed by the impact was heard throughout the nearby community of Orland, about 90 miles (145 km) north of Sacramento, said Glenn County Sheriff Larry Jones.Among the dead were the two drivers, as well as five high school students and a college recruiter on their way north to visit Humboldt State University in Arcata, California, as part of a program to help disadvantaged college hopefuls. More than 30 others were injured in the wreck.""We don't know whether the FedEx driver had fallen asleep, whether he experienced a mechanical failure with his vehicle or whether there was a separate collision on the southbound side that caused him to lose control,"" said Lieutenant Scott Fredrick, the lead Highway Patrol investigator.A team of investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board are likely to remain on-site for about two weeks for the board's independent review of the accident.Most of the FedEx truck, which was hauling two semi-trailers, was consumed in the fire, Mark Rosekind, an NTSB investigator, said at a briefing late on Friday. But, he added, there were sufficient remains of both drivers for authorities to have collected samples for blood and toxicology analysis.""So right now, one of the things we're in the process of doing is seeing whether or not those required samples were actually collected,"" he added. The fire was so intense that it could be days or weeks before some of the bodies can be identified, and investigators will have to rely on dental records or in some cases DNA testing, he said.On Saturday, an NTSB spokesman said there was a chance that the fire destroyed any electronic tracking modules on the bus that would have recorded the speed and braking.TWO OTHER BUSES ARRIVED SAFELY  The stricken motor coach was one of three buses of students traveling from Southern California to participate in a spring break recruitment program at Humboldt State. The two other buses had arrived safely at the campus before the third bus crashed.Nestled near the redwoods about 100 miles (161 km) south of the Oregon border, the university every year invites high school seniors from disadvantaged backgrounds or who may be the first in their families to attend college to tour the campus.The Los Angeles Unified School District, the largest in Southern California, said some of the 19 students from its high schools who were on the tour rode on the ill-fated bus, but it could not say whether any of them were among the victims.Apart from the driver, the bus was carrying 44 to 48 students and several chaperones, highway patrol spokeswoman Lacey Heitman said. About 34 people were taken by air and land ambulances to hospitals with a variety of injuries, police said.Among those killed was Humboldt State recruiter Arthur Arzola, 26, who worked for the university out of the Southern California community of Rancho Cucamonga.A recently engaged couple serving as chaperones were also among the dead, local media reported.Jonathan Gutierrez, 17, told NBC's ""Today"" show that after the crash the bus filled with smoke and students broke windows to escape.

22,"   By Sharon Bernstein | ORLAND, California  ORLAND, California Newly released recordings of 911 emergency calls revealed the helplessness of stunned residents in the California town of Orland who witnessed the aftermath of last week's fiery crash between a FedEx truck and a tour bus that killed 10 people.The California Highway Patrol made the recordings public on Thursday as investigators returned to the scene of the accident, painstakingly driving a pristine white tour bus back and forth over the charred and bubbled surface of Interstate 5 in an effort to reconstruct the April 10 collision.""Whatever is on the freeway is on fire,"" a man is heard telling emergency dispatchers on one of the recordings. ""I just heard an explosion, but now I hear sirens. I'm running over to see what it is.""Five high school students and five adults, including the two drivers, died when the FedEx tractor trailer swerved across the highway median and slammed head-on into a motor coach filled with about 50 Los Angeles-area teenagers on their way to visit Humboldt State University in Arcata, California.A blast unleashed by the impact was so loud that it was heard throughout nearby Orland, an agricultural community about 90 miles north of Sacramento.Authorities said Thursday they still have not determined what caused the freight truck to careen through the tall, thick bushes growing along the center of the divided interstate and plow directly into the path of the motor coach.In an audio replay of the experiences neighbors recounted from the moments after the crash, 911 operators can be heard telling the callers to stay away from the scene, and that emergency personnel were already arriving.Carla Lopez, 17, and her mother live just a few feet away from the highway in a neighborhood of modest houses so close to the accident site that some residents fretted that one of the vehicles could have come flying off the road into their homes. POWERLESS TO HELP On Thursday, they clung to each other next to a makeshift memorial by the side of the interstate, watching Highway Patrol drivers maneuver a borrowed bus and FedEx tractor-trailer back and forth along the road.On the clear, sunny afternoon last week when the collision occurred, the family heard a noise and ran outside, the teenager recalled.""We couldn't help because the bus kept exploding,"" Lopez said quietly. ""So we couldn't get near it."" The scene was all fire and pandemonium, said Glenn County Sheriff Larry Jones.""People don't realize how easily it could have been everyone on that bus who died,"" Jones said. ""They were on fire. The girls' hair was on fire.""Had it not been for the relative youth and flexibility of the passengers, and for two students who managed to kick out the windows of the bus, everyone aboard the bus might have perished, Jones said.""If this had been a bus full of older people headed to the casinos or something, they would have all died,"" he said. ""It's just by the grace of God that we have these survivors."" At a news conference at the crash site on Thursday, officials said it could be months before they know what caused the crash.Investigators trying to determine the presumed speed of the colliding vehicles slowed traffic on the interstate - the main West Coast highway from San Diego to Washington state - running a stand-in bus and truck past each other repeatedly, and taking measurements. Another test checked how far the bus would skid if the brakes were applied at highway speeds.Nearby, three small memorials shone in the bright sunlight of the hot Sacramento Valley afternoon. One consisted of a single red flower, planted in a square of orange emergency tape out on the highway where workers had hauled away the last of the debris from the crash earlier Thursday morning.The largest, pressed up against a chain-link fence erected to keep pedestrians off of the freeway, featured a cross made of yellow blossoms, vases of red, purple and vanilla-colored flowers and 35 religious candles.Above these hung posters, some signed by relatives of the dead and others by residents of Orland. A palette of paints with brushes attached was taped on to the poster, in memory of a teenaged artist among the victims.""To my dear cousin,"" someone had written on the poster, ""It was early for you to go.""(Reporting by Sharon Bernstein; Editing by Ken Wills)",2014-04-18,FDX,"Fri Apr 18, 2014 | 9:20am EDT",Neighbors rushed in vain to help in California bus crash that killed 10,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-usa-california-crash-idUSBREA3H03O20140418?type=companyNews
23,"  The mother of a 17-year-old student who was among 10 people killed in a highway crash in northern California earlier this month has sued FedEx Corp for negligence, California-based City News Service reported.More than 30 others were injured when a FedEx tractor-trailer crossed a highway median and slammed into a bus on Interstate 5 about 90 miles north of Sacramento. The students were from the Los Angeles area.Reuters could not independently confirm the lawsuit. FedEx and the family's attorney did not immediately respond to requests for comment. ""We remain focused on providing support to those affected and cooperating with the authorities as they conduct their investigation,"" FedEx said in a statement, according to CNS.

30,"  May 2 FedEx Corp, the world's second largest parcel delivery company, said FedEx Freight would raise fuel surcharge by 3 percent next month, aiming to offset an increase in costs from rising fuel prices.The company also said FedEx Ground would start applying dimensional weight pricing to all shipments from January next year. Dimensional weight pricing is currently applied only to packages measuring three cubic feet or greater.""They are raising their fuel recovery. It will increase the cost to shippers,"" said David Vernon, an analyst at Sanford Bernstein.The move comes after FedEx reported a lower-than-expected quarterly profit and cut its full-year forecast in March due to higher costs related to rising fuel prices and the winter storms in the United States. Fuel costs at FedEx Freight rose 3 percent in the third quarter ended Feb. 28. The business contributed about 12 percent to the company's total revenue in the quarter.Both FedEx and larger rival UPS raised shipping rates for their freight units in March. Freight is a more competitive than the ground and express businesses, where FedEx and UPS are the only two big players. The FedEx Freight business includes FedEx Freight Canada, FedEx Custom Critical and FedEx Freight, which is a provider of less-than-truckload freight services.Less-than-truckload is the shipping of relatively small loads of freight, and customers use this method because it costs less than hiring an entire truck for an exclusive shipment.FedEx Ground ships small packages throughout the United States and Canada and also delivers low-weight packages through a partnership with the U.S. Postal Service.

Since a tie for ninth at the Humana Challenge in January, Crane hasn’t finished better than a tie for 32nd and missed five of his last seven cuts leading in.Malnati, a 26-year-old rookie coming off the secondary web.com tour, was another surprise packet given he has missed the cut on eight of his 11 appearances on tour this year.His 65 equaled his career low on tour and was his first round in the 60s since early March in Puerto Rico. “There have been some negative thoughts bouncing around in my head for most of the year but in the last couple of weeks I’ve kind of gotten it turned around,” said the Tennessee resident, who sits 172nd on the FedEx Cup points list.“I expected to come out and play well so it was great. I am really trying hard to really think about just playing golf and having fun.Mickelson, who will attempt to complete the career grand slam in the U.S. Open next week was treading water at one-over through 11 holes before making birdies on four of his last seven to push right into the mix. Given his focus was finishing off rounds after letting them slip in previous tournaments the 43-year-old was pretty pleased.“This was what I was hoping for and what I was really hoping to work on this week,” Mickelson told reporters.“I had a nice solid round going, not too many birdies, not too many bogeys but to finish off birdie-ing three of the last four makes it a great round and it is exactly what I need to do.”Defending champion Harris English struggled to a 73.

35,"   By Sweta Singh  FedEx Corp (FDX.N) reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit as strong shipments of items ordered online boosted the ground business of world's No. 2 parcel delivery company.FedEx said results in 2015 would also benefit from the restructuring of its express business, its largest by revenue, and it forecast full-year earnings that were better than many analysts and investors had expected.The company's shares rose as much as 5.4 percent to a life high of $147.89 on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday.""Forward earnings estimates across the Street (had) declined, as many were somewhat cautious on the quarter...,"" Cowen & Co analyst Helane Becker wrote in a note to clients.The company, like larger rival United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N), has been cutting costs to offset rising fuel prices.The Memphis-based company is also restructuring its Express business, which has suffered as clients choose slower but cheaper delivery options, by revamping its routes and cutting capacity to Asia and other international markets.""Ground and Freight are performing well and Express remains on track to achieve its profit improvement plan despite the fuel headwinds we've experienced,"" Chief Executive Fred Smith said on a post-earnings call.Revenue from FedEx's ground business, which accounts for a quarter of the company's total revenue, rose 8 percent to $3.01 billion in the fourth quarter ended May 31. U.S. online retail sales are expected to increase to about $300 billion in 2014 from $260 billion last year, according to John Yozzo, managing director of FTI Consulting Inc's (FTI.N) Corporate Finance/Restructuring business.SIZE MATTERS FedEx said last month it would start charging for all ground shipments by parcel size, in addition to weight, to reduce costs. UPS followed suit with a similar announcement on Tuesday in the face of rising oil prices amid concerns that escalating violence in Iraq could disrupt supplies.The new pricing will allow the logistics giants to charge more for items that are bulky, but not necessarily heavy, such as diapers and large soft toys.That will add to shipping costs for online retailers such as Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and eBay Inc (EBAY.O).FedEx forecast 2015 earnings of $8.50 to $9.00 per share. Analysts expect $8.75, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. If FedEx meets the high end of its forecast, it would beat or be in line with the expectations of 22 out of the 29 analysts covering the company, according to Thomson Reuters data.        Total revenue in the quarter rose 3.5 percent to $11.8 billion. Analysts had expected $11.66 billion. The company reported earnings of $2.46 per share, well above the average analyst estimate of $2.36 per share.FedEx said capital expenditure would rise about 2 percent to $4.2 billion in 2015. The increase is largely due to aircraft deliveries to support the company's fleet modernization program and for expansion of its ground network.FedEx shares were up 4.9 percent at $147.19 in early afternoon trading.

The Memphis-based company is also restructuring its Express business, which has suffered as clients choose slower but cheaper delivery options, by revamping its routes and cutting capacity to Asia and other international markets.""Ground and Freight are performing well and Express remains on track to achieve its profit improvement plan despite the fuel headwinds we've experienced,"" Chief Executive Fred Smith said on a post-earnings call.Revenue from FedEx's ground business, which accounts for a quarter of the company's total revenue, rose 8 percent to $3.01 billion in the fourth quarter ended May 31.U.S. online retail sales are expected to increase to about $300 billion in 2014 from $260 billion last year, according to John Yozzo, managing director of FTI Consulting Inc's  Corporate Finance/Restructuring business. SIZE MATTERS FedEx said last month it would start charging for all ground shipments by parcel size, in addition to weight, to reduce costs.UPS followed suit with a similar announcement on Tuesday in the face of rising oil prices amid concerns that escalating violence in Iraq could disrupt supplies. The new pricing will allow the logistics giants to charge more for items that are bulky, but not necessarily heavy, such as diapers and large soft toys.That will add to shipping costs for online retailers such as Amazon.com Inc and eBay Inc.FedEx forecast 2015 earnings of $8.50 to $9.00 per share. Analysts expect $8.75, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.If FedEx meets the high end of its forecast, it would beat or be in line with the expectations of 22 out of the 29 analysts covering the company, according to Thomson Reuters data.Total revenue in the quarter rose 3.5 percent to $11.8 billion. Analysts had expected $11.66 billion.The company reported earnings of $2.46 per share, well above the average analyst estimate of $2.36 per share.FedEx said capital expenditure would rise about 2 percent to $4.2 billion in 2015. The increase is largely due to aircraft deliveries to support the company's fleet modernization program and for expansion of its ground network.FedEx shares were up 4.9 percent at $147.19 in early afternoon trading.

40,"   By Erwin Seba and Terry Wade | HOUSTON  HOUSTON The man accused of killing six members of his former wife's family, including four children, at their suburban Houston home collapsed in court on Friday when details of the crime were read aloud and was wheeled out in an office chair by sheriff's deputies.Ronald Lee Haskell, 33, was in court wearing orange prison attire for a hearing after being charged on Thursday with capital murder in the shooting deaths of his former wife's sister, her husband and four of their children, aged 4 to 14.He was being held without bond. Police have said Haskell entered the home on Wednesday posing as a delivery man and searching for his former wife, then methodically executed members of the family.Doug Durham, Haskell's public defender, said his client had been in and out of hospitals in Utah and California with a history of mental illness and that he was not taking prescribed medication at the time of the killings.     He was expected to face a hearing on his mental capacity. A grand jury will decide whether he will be tried for capital murder, which carries the possibility of the death penalty.Haskell said ""Yes, sir"" to the judge after his rights were read and then fainted to the floor as details of the crime were read in court by the prosecutor. Sheriff's deputies picked him up and wheeled him out of the courtroom in an office chair.Haskell is accused of fatally shooting two boys ages 4 and 14, two girls ages 7 and 9, and their parents Stephen Stay, 39, and Katie Stay, 33. Five of them were dead when found and one of the children died after being air-lifted to a hospital. Cassidy Stay, 15, survived a gunshot wound to the head.Cassidy was released from the hospital earlier on Friday and is expected to make a full recovery, the hospital said. Harris County prosecutor Tammy Thomas told the judge that Haskell methodically executed the family, tying them up and then firing two bullets into each of them, starting with the mother.VICTIMS TIED UP  Haskell, pretending to be a FedEx delivery man, entered the home when Cassidy told him to wait while she got a pen to take down his name and number, Thomas said.The teenager did not recognize her uncle, who had grown a beard in recent months, until after Haskell told her his name, Thomas said. He then pulled a gun and ordered her to assemble the other children in the living room before tying them up as they lay on the floor, Thomas added. Their parents were confronted by Haskell when they returned from a trip to the bank, according to the prosecution. When the family was together in one room, Haskell began to shoot them in a brazen attack that showed elements of planning, said Thomas, who appeared distraught after reading details of the crime to the court. ""Maybe reality is finally settling in,"" she told reporters afterward when asked what prompted Haskell to collapse. ""It makes no difference to me if he understands how much trouble he is in. We’ll get a jury to do that for him.""A neighbor previously told Reuters that Haskell was angry with the family for facilitating the divorce from his former wife, who did not live at the house and was not harmed in the incident.    Cassidy Stay, left for dead, called police and alerted them to the shootings and said that Haskell was going to the home of more relatives. Police intercepted him before he arrived.Police in San Marcos, California, have said they suspect Haskell bound his mother to a chair during an argument last week. Police in Logan, Utah, have said they once arrested Haskell for domestic violence when he lived there with his then-wife from 2006 to 2013, but charges were dropped in a plea deal.

""Given the early stage of this matter, we cannot yet determine the amount or range of potential loss; however, it is possible that it could be material."" The company did not provide further specific details but said the matter was part of broader competition investigations in France. The French regulator declined to comment.Royal Mail shares were down 1.8 percent at 480 pence in early trading.Both FedEX Corp, the world's No.2 parcel delivery group, and Dutch logistics company TNT Express have also released similar notice statements about their businesses in France.FedEx said that French authorities were investigating anticompetitive behaviour that is alleged to have occurred ""primarily during trade association meetings"" involving general managers of Tatex, which became FedEx Express France after the American company bought the business in July 2012. POTENTIAL FINES TNT Express said it had cooperated with the investigation since it started in 2010. Analysts at Espirito Santo said any fine would be relatively insignificant for Royal Mail but would represent worse news for TNT Express.""French antitrust law permits a maximum fine of 10 percent of worldwide turnover,"" Espirito analysts said in a note.""This would lead to a worst-case scenario of around a 160 million pound ($274 million) fine for Royal Mail (10 percent of GLS revenue) and about a 670 million euro ($908 million) fine for TNT Express (group revenue of 6.7 billion euros).GLS contributed about 17 percent of Royal Mail's 9.45 billion pound revenue for the year to March 30.The GLS network covers 37 countries but its main markets are Germany, Italy and France, which account for 70 percent of sales.Royal Mail is in the middle of a turnaround programme in France, where its business made an operating loss of 27 million euros in its previous financial year. The group has exited its overnight courier service and is focusing on two to three-day parcel deliveries rather than an express service.

Both Northern California-based attorneys have a history of representing high-profile clients, including Bonds, who was convicted of one count of obstruction of justice in 2011 in connection with a steroids investigation.Bonds was sentenced to 30 days of home confinement, which was put on hold as the verdict is under appeal.Arguedas and Ruby declined to comment on Monday on FedEx.

Senior managers at the company were repeatedly warned that illegal pharmacies were using its services, the indictment said.Instead of stopping the conduct, FedEx devised policies so it could continue, the filing said. FedEx strenuously denied the charges, saying it was innocent.

56,"  (Adds background, context)By Amanda BeckerAug 27 Groups of mostly former FedEx drivers in California and Oregon can move forward with lawsuits alleging they are owed unpaid wages and benefits under state and federal labor laws after a U.S. appeals court said Wednesday they were employees, not independent contractors.A three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, sitting in Portland, Oregon, reversed a lower court's ruling, noting that FedEx drivers wear company uniforms, drive company-approved vehicles and are told where and when to deliver packages.The appeals court noted that the claims brought by the California and Oregon drivers are among similar cases filed against FedEx in approximately 40 states. Other courts have sided with FedEx, finding that drivers are independent contractors. FedEx said Wednesday it will challenge the decision, and will ask the full 9th Circuit to review the panel's findings.""We fundamentally disagree with these rulings,"" FedEx Ground Senior Vice President and General Counsel Cary Blancett said in a statement.The FedEx cases highlight how employees and independent contractors are entitled to different rights and protections under a patchwork of federal and state labor laws. Non-exempt employees are entitled to overtime compensation under the federal Fair Labor Standards Act, protection under state minimum wage laws and time off under the Family Medical Leave Act, for example, whereas independent contractors are not.The California case was brought by about 2,300 workers who were full-time FedEx delivery drivers between 2000 and 2007. The Oregon claims were brought by roughly 360 full-time FedEx delivery drivers between 1999 and 2009. Under the terms of an operating agreement used by FedEx, the drivers were classified as independent contractors, court documents state. But, FedEx had a ""broad right to control the manner in which its drivers perform their work,"" the panel wrote in determining the drivers were employees.The panel highlighted the fact that FedEx assigned the drivers delivery areas, directed where packages went and assessed drivers' workloads. Though drivers provided their own vehicles, the agreement used by FedEx mandated that vans have certain dimensions, the FedEx logo and be painted a specific shade of Sherwin-Williams paint known as ""FedEx white"".FedEx said that it is no longer using the operating agreement on which the 9th Circuit's rulings were based and that it has updated its agreements to reflect state-level legal and regulatory changes, clarifying that FedEx Ground drivers are independent contractors.The cases are Dean Alexander, et al v. FedEx Ground Package System Inc dba FedEx Home Delivery and Edward Slayman, et al v. FedEx Ground Package System Inc dba FedEx Home Delivery, 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, Nos. 12-17458 and 12-35525.

63,"   By Nick Carey | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Package delivery company FedEx Corp should enjoy a record holiday peak season thanks to the continued rise of  online consumer sales in the United States, company officials said on Wednesday.Executive vice president Michael Glenn said on a conference call with analysts after FedEx reported better-than-expected quarterly results that the company would add more than 50,000 seasonal workers to handle the anticipated spike in shipping. Alongside its main rival United Parcel Service Inc, FedEx is considered a bellwether of U.S. economic activity.  FedEx has been in an ""active dialogue with our retail and E-tail customers all year to understand their peak shipping needs and plan our operations accordingly,"" Glenn said.UPS announced this week that it would hire up to 95,000 seasonal workers for peak season, nearly double the 55,000 it hired last year. A surge in online shopping and severe weather  last Christmas caught UPS off guard, resulting in delays that angered customers.Beyond the holiday season, FedEx expects the U.S. economy to grow at a rate of 3.1 percent in 2015. The company said the global economy should also grow at a rate of 3.1 percent next year.  Constraints across America's supply chain system as the economy grows have enabled shipping and transport companies to raise prices for customers. That pricing power is expected to continue for the foreseeable future.Late Tuesday FedEx announced an across-the-board 4.9 percent rate increase effective early January 2015. FedEx reported a better-than-expected 24 percent jump in quarterly profit Wednesday as it benefited from higher shipment volumes. The company's net income rose to $606 million, or $2.l0 per share, in the first quarter ended Aug. 31, from $489 million, or $1.53 per share, a year earlier. Revenue increased 6 percent to $11.7 billion.Analysts had expected earnings of $1.96 per share on revenue of $11.48 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. ""Coupled with solid general rate increases announced last night...FedEx appears well positioned in the competitive landscape to outperform through the peak season,"" Citigroup analyst Christian Wetherbee wrote in a note for clients.FedEx Ground average daily volume grew 6 percent in the quarter, primarily driven by growth in e-commerce, the company said.The company also reaffirmed its 2015 earnings forecast of $8.50-$9.00 per share. Analysts are expecting earnings of $8.84 per share.In early trading FedEx's shares were up 3.4 percent at $159.96. Shares of larger rival UPS were up 0.9 percent.

A surge in online shopping and severe weather  last Christmas caught UPS off guard, resulting in delays that angered customers. Beyond the holiday season, FedEx expects the U.S. economy to grow at a rate of 3.1 percent in 2015. The company said the global economy should also grow at a rate of 3.1 percent next year.Constraints across America's supply chain system as the economy grows have enabled shipping and transport companies to raise prices for customers. That pricing power is expected to continue for the foreseeable future.Late Tuesday FedEx announced an across-the-board 4.9 percent rate increase effective early January 2015. FedEx reported a better-than-expected 24 percent jump in quarterly profit Wednesday as it benefited from higher shipment volumes.The company's net income rose to $606 million, or $2.l0 per share, in the first quarter ended Aug. 31, from $489 million, or $1.53 per share, a year earlier.Revenue increased 6 percent to $11.7 billion. Analysts had expected earnings of $1.96 per share on revenue of $11.48 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.""Coupled with solid general rate increases announced last night...FedEx appears well positioned in the competitive landscape to outperform through the peak season,"" Citigroup analyst Christian Wetherbee wrote in a note for clients.FedEx Ground average daily volume grew 6 percent in the quarter, primarily driven by growth in e-commerce, the company said.The company also reaffirmed its 2015 earnings forecast of $8.50-$9.00 per share. Analysts are expecting earnings of $8.84 per share.In early trading FedEx's shares were up 3.4 percent at $159.96. Shares of larger rival UPS were up 0.9 percent.

66,"  (Adds comment from FedEx paragraph 5)BEIJING/SHANGHAI, Sept 25 China said it would ease restrictions on foreign couriers seeking to deliver packages nationwide, potentially increasing competition in a fast-growing business already marked by bruising price wars.The State Council, or cabinet, said in a statement late on Wednesday it had decided to ""fully liberalise"" the market for parcel delivery to promote fair competition between domestic and foreign firms.It said the government would allow foreign firms that met certain criteria to take part, and would also encourage mergers in the sector.The statement, however, did not give any details or specify what restrictions would be eased, or what the government's criteria were. FedEx Corp, which along with United Parcel Service Inc operate express parcel delivery services in China, told Reuters on Thursday it welcomed the cabinet decision. It declined, however, to provide any details on the measure.UPS did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the government announcement.U.S. and European trade officials have in the past criticised as protectionist Chinese regulations on the postal sector. Both the American and European chambers of commerce welcomed government measures to liberalise the sector in separate statements. Under a 2009 law, all courier firms must obtain city government permits before they can deliver packages anywhere in China. Local firms have found it much easier and quicker to do so than foreign couriers.The law also bans non-Chinese couriers from delivering domestic mail, a lucrative market segment the foreign firms have lobbied hard to access. State-owned postal service China Post , which dominates that market, made 14.5 billion yuan ($2.36 billion) from delivering mail last year. Express parcel delivery is booming in China, thanks to a surge in e-commerce. Revenues in the express parcel delivery market have more than doubled to $13 billion over the five years to 2011, and are expected to surpass the $70 billion a year generated in the United States, and become the biggest in the world by 2032.The Chinese market, however, is highly fragmented and competition is stiff.There are currently more than 35,000 express delivery companies operating in China. Some can ship packages for hundreds of miles for as little as 2 yuan (32 US cents), and as quickly as within the same day, a minuscule amount compared to  the U.S. Postal Service, which on average charges at least $10 for a domestic delivery.In 2011, DHL, a division of the German logistics company Deutsche Post AG, exited the Chinese domestic express delivery market to focus on international shipments, citing its inability to compete on such razor-thin margins.

69,"   By Nick Carey | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Oct 22 Package delivery company FedEx Corp on Wednesday forecast a record holiday season this year, with 22.6 million shipments expected for its anticipated peak day on Dec. 15.The Memphis-based company said it looks to move more than 290 million packages between Black Friday, the day after the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday that kicks off the holiday shopping season, and Christmas Eve.With the rise of e-commerce, FedEx's annual peak has nearly doubled since 2007, when it moved 11.5 million packages on Dec. 17. Last year a later-than-usual surge before the holidays left an estimated 2 million packages stranded on Christmas Eve, a problem that affected Atlanta-based United Parcel Service Inc  far more than FedEx. ""We're very proud of our performance last year when we faced the most challenging weather in our company's history,"" said Patrick Fitzgerald, vice president of integrated marketing and communications at FedEx. ""We have worked in a very collaborative way with our retail partners to see what their needs are going to be and we stand ready to deliver.""FedEx has said up to 90 percent of its $1.2 billion in capital investments this year are designed to increase capacity to handle peak season. The company plans to hire 50,000 seasonal workers, up from 40,000 last year. UPS has not yet provided a peak holiday volume forecast for this year, but typically does so after it reports third-quarter earnings, which are due on Oct 24.UPS has said it will take on 95,000 seasonal workers to handle holiday packages, up from around 55,000 last year.

70,"   By Nick Carey | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Determined not to repeat a holiday season that left millions of packages delivered too late and customers seething, United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) and FedEx Corp (FDX.N) are investing heavily in new infrastructure - but the continued dynamic growth of e-commerce will test those efforts. The world's two largest shipping companies are building new facilities, adding more temporary holiday workers and pushing retailers to help them avoid a recurrence of a pre-Christmas shipping logjam. Even so, the rise in shipping originating with e-tailers including Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and Zappos could test even the new capacity levels. Peak days at both companies now equal roughly double their average daily volumes. Mark Wallace, vice president of engineering in the United States at UPS, said the company still has volume limits, despite substantial investment this year. ""There is only so much capacity in the network.""A late spike in demand last year caused by last-minute online promotions plagued express delivery companies. Some 2 million express packages were left stranded by delivery companies on Christmas Eve, according to shipment-tracking software developer ShipMatrix Inc. UPS experienced far more severe problems than FedEx.  This year, UPS has allocated $500 million to expand and improve facilities and is hiring 95,000 seasonal workers - or 10,000 more than last year - to handle 2014 holiday packages.During its second-quarter conference call, UPS Chief Executive David Abney said ""these projects will weigh on earnings in 2014"" but pay off long-term. A spokesman declined to comment further ahead of UPS's next quarterly earnings, expected to be released on Friday.  FedEx has said up to 90 percent of its $1.2 billion investments this year are to boost capacity. The company plans to hire 50,000 seasonal workers, up from 40,000 last year. Patrick Fitzgerald, senior vice president of marketing and communications at FedEx, said this year's capital investments would not affect the company's earnings forecast.The investment is designed to address the rapid growth of consumer goods ordered online. Through 2013, peak volume, referring to the busiest day of the year, had climbed 57 percent over five years at FedEx, to 22 million packages. It jumped 40 percent at UPS, to 31 million packages.  Deloitte LLP predicts sales growth of up to 14 percent this holiday season, and FedEx said on Wednesday it expected peak-day package volumes to reach 22.6 million this year. The peaks have become more pronounced closer to Christmas as last-minute online free shipping deals have proliferated. Unchecked, those peaks will only grow worse, experts said. ""The e-commerce shipping model isn't sustainable in its current form,"" said Yossi Sheffi, a professor of engineering systems and director of the Center for Transportation & Logistics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). ""You cannot build a shipping network to operate 365 days a year based on a spike in packages three days before Christmas.""         PROTECTING THE CORE  In a bid to better manage the peak, the shipping giants have asked retailers for clearer estimates of 2014 holiday volumes and have encouraged earlier deadlines for consumer orders. ""We now have the kind of visibility we didn't before on what to expect from our largest customers,"" said UPS's Wallace.FedEx's Fitzgerald said customers could be disappointed if they offer last-minute sales without first consulting FedEx. ""If we don't have the right discussions up-front, we may not be ready to handle"" a sudden surge, Fitzgerald said.  In mid-August, Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) gave its carriers its peak forecast, both by day and by shipping facility, three weeks earlier than usual. Contingency plans include shipping from alternate Wal-Mart distribution centers or upgrading packages to faster services if ""deemed at risk"" of missing Christmas, said spokeswoman Jaeme Lazckowski.Nordstrom Inc (JWN.N) has moved up its cutoff point for Christmas deliveries by three hours on Dec. 23, and UPS has agreed to additional last-minute flights for the company.   FedEx and UPS had no choice but to engage retailers in reducing peak loads and getting them to manage consumer expectations on realistic delivery deadlines, said veteran Cowan & Co analyst Helane Becker. ""They can't keep trying to squeeze more and more through such a narrow funnel,"" she said. Both FedEx and UPS are concerned about impact on their core business-to-business customers.  ""When packages went undelivered last year, that also affected high-volume business customers,"" said Rick Jones, a former UPS executive and now CEO of regional delivery company Lone Star Overnight. ""Have no doubt this is not about getting little Johnny his Christmas present. It's about protecting that core business.""Logistics experts say the 2014 adjustments are a temporary fix, and more changes are needed for the 2015 holiday season. A price hike might help tackle ubiquitous free shipping offers, and negotiations with Amazon, in particular, likely will occur.  ""What you will see is Amazon Prime with a little minus for the three days before Christmas - where free shipping doesn't apply,"" said MIT's Sheffi. ""And Amazon will be able to blame UPS for it anyway.""Amazon declined specific comment. ""We work very closely with all of our delivery partners and are confident in their ability to deliver for Amazon customers this holiday,"" the company said in a statement. FedEx's Fitzgerald said the company does not plan a 2015 price increase ""at this point.""

73,"   By Nick Carey | CHICAGO  CHICAGO After years of failed efforts, the Teamsters union has won a toehold in the trucking units of FedEx and Con-way and is targeting more facilities at both, potentially threatening what analysts see as a core competitive advantage for the companies.  The push by the Teamsters comes as a shortage of experienced drivers in the trucking industry is prompting companies to hike pay and offer improved working conditions.The International Brotherhood Teamsters, which represents 1.4 million workers and is one of North America's most powerful unions, has long tried to unionize workers at FedEx Corp and last month won votes to have union representation at two local FedEx Freight facilities out of three holding secret ballots.Five ballots are scheduled at FedEx Freight facilities this month, with the next due on Nov. 12 in Newark, New Jersey.With the exception of its pilots, FedEx's workforce is non-unionized. While pay for its drivers is above that of some competitors, its larger rival United Parcel Service Inc pays its unionized drivers more, and FedEx has higher profit margins. The Teamsters also won two out of four recent ballots at Con-way Freight, part of Con-way Inc, which according to industry estimates pays slightly more than FedEx but less than UPS.The Teamsters declined to comment for this article. The expanding U.S. economy has driven up freight demand at a time when older truckers are retiring and fewer new drivers are signing up. That shortage hurts long-haul truckers more than less-than-truckload operators like FedEx Freight and Con-way Freight, which fill up trucks with smaller orders from multiple customers. But it has forced up pay across the industry. In April, FedEx announced pay increases for 19,000 FedEx Freight drivers at the unit's 360 facilities, effective October.""Drivers and dock workers currently have the ball in their court, and it may be there for a long while,"" Cowen & Co analyst Jason Seidl said in an Oct. 30 client note, adding Con-way's battle against the Teamsters could weigh on its results short term.FedEx Freight accounted for $5.8 billion of FedEx's $45.6 billion fiscal 2014 revenue, while Con-way Freight contributed $3.5 billion of Con-way's $5.5 billion revenue in 2013.Both companies are fighting the unionization effort. After the Teamsters scored wins against Con-way, one in September and one in October, the company filed objections to the ballots with the National Labor Relations Board claiming the union intimidated workers, and emphasizes the union's victories affect only two out of around 300 facilities.      ""We don't believe we need a third party between ourselves and our employees,"" Con-way Chief Executive Officer Doug Stotlar told analysts in an Oct. 31 conference call.FedEx has said it is weighing an appeal with the NLRB against the most recent vote in favor of union representation on Oct. 31 at a facility in New Jersey.While gains have so far been small - there are only about 150 drivers at the FedEx Freight facilities where the Teamsters won ballots - the union said on its website other campaigns were under way. ""The aim here appears to be to unionize an entire sector,"" said Dan Cornfield, a Vanderbilt University labor analyst. But it could be an uphill struggle.According to data compiled by industry expert SJ Consulting Group Inc, as of July this year Con-way Freight drivers made $24.75 an hour, while FedEx Freight drivers earned $24.40. Among unionized companies, wages at ArcBest Corp were $23.17 and $21.10 at YRC Worldwide Inc.Unionized truckers at UPS Freight make an estimated $26.65.SJ Consulting founder Satish Jindel said the Teamsters will likely face difficulty persuading FedEx Freight and Con-way Freight drivers that collective bargaining is a boon when two major unionized carriers pay less.""FedEx Freight and Con-way are seasoned campaigners, as they have been fighting unionization for decades,"" he said.

74,"   By Nick Carey | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Nov 10 After years of failed efforts, the Teamsters union has won a toehold in the trucking units of FedEx and Con-way and is targeting more facilities at both, potentially threatening what analysts see as a core competitive advantage for the companies.The push by the Teamsters comes as a shortage of experienced drivers in the trucking industry is prompting companies to hike pay and offer improved working conditions.The International Brotherhood Teamsters, which represents 1.4 million workers and is one of North America's most powerful unions, has long tried to unionize workers at FedEx Corp  and last month won votes to have union representation at two local FedEx Freight facilities out of three holding secret ballots.Five ballots are scheduled at FedEx Freight facilities this month, with the next due on Nov. 12 in Newark, New Jersey.With the exception of its pilots, FedEx's workforce is non-unionized. While pay for its drivers is above that of some competitors, its larger rival United Parcel Service Inc  pays its unionized drivers more, and FedEx has higher profit margins.The Teamsters also won two out of four recent ballots at Con-way Freight, part of Con-way Inc, which according to industry estimates pays slightly more than FedEx but less than UPS.The Teamsters declined to comment for this article. The expanding U.S. economy has driven up freight demand at a time when older truckers are retiring and fewer new drivers are signing up. That shortage hurts long-haul truckers more than less-than-truckload operators like FedEx Freight and Con-way Freight, which fill up trucks with smaller orders from multiple customers. But it has forced up pay across the industry.In April, FedEx announced pay increases for 19,000 FedEx Freight drivers at the unit's 360 facilities, effective October.""Drivers and dock workers currently have the ball in their court, and it may be there for a long while,"" Cowen & Co analyst Jason Seidl said in an Oct. 30 client note, adding Con-way's battle against the Teamsters could weigh on its results short term.FedEx Freight accounted for $5.8 billion of FedEx's $45.6 billion fiscal 2014 revenue, while Con-way Freight contributed $3.5 billion of Con-way's $5.5 billion revenue in 2013. Both companies are fighting the unionization effort. After the Teamsters scored wins against Con-way, one in September and one in October, the company filed objections to the ballots with the National Labor Relations Board claiming the union intimidated workers, and emphasizes the union's victories affect only two out of around 300 facilities.""We don't believe we need a third party between ourselves and our employees,"" Con-way Chief Executive Officer Doug Stotlar told analysts in an Oct. 31 conference call.FedEx has said it is weighing an appeal with the NLRB against the most recent vote in favor of union representation on Oct. 31 at a facility in New Jersey. While gains have so far been small - there are only about 150 drivers at the FedEx Freight facilities where the Teamsters won ballots - the union said on its website other campaigns were under way.""The aim here appears to be to unionize an entire sector,"" said Dan Cornfield, a Vanderbilt University labor analyst.But it could be an uphill struggle.According to data compiled by industry expert SJ Consulting Group Inc, as of July this year Con-way Freight drivers made $24.75 an hour, while FedEx Freight drivers earned $24.40. Among unionized companies, wages at ArcBest Corp were $23.17 and $21.10 at YRC Worldwide Inc.Unionized truckers at UPS Freight make an estimated $26.65.SJ Consulting founder Satish Jindel said the Teamsters will likely face difficulty persuading FedEx Freight and Con-way Freight drivers that collective bargaining is a boon when two major unionized carriers pay less.""FedEx Freight and Con-way are seasoned campaigners, as they have been fighting unionization for decades,"" he said. ""They are not going to be easy targets for the Teamsters.""   (Additional reporting by Deepa Seetharaman.

A strengthening U.S. economy is expected to trump global economic worries for the Fed, which is likely to signal it is still on track to raise rates. Many investors were devoting attention to whether the central bank drops its longstanding view that it would wait a ""considerable time"" before raising rates.""Volatility should be expected after the statement because so much is riding on two words, which in some respects speaks to the dysfunction of the market,"" said Peter Kenny, chief market strategist at Clearpool Group in New York. ""But that said, markets have an enormous amount of confidence in the Fed and the Fed's ability to navigate through troubled waters.""The S&P energy sector, which has fallen sharply with the heavy selloff in oil prices since June, was up 4.3 percent, leading gains on the benchmark index. The Fed's statement is due at 2:00 p.m. EST (1900 GMT) and will be followed by a news conference by Chair Janet Yellen half an hour later.At 1:03 p.m., the Dow Jones industrial average was up 151.05 points, or 0.88 percent, at 17,219.92, the S&P 500  gained 21.18 points, or 1.07 percent, to 1,993.92, and the Nasdaq Composite added 38.03 points, or 0.84 percent, to 4,585.87.

84,"   By Nick Carey | CHICAGO  CHICAGO FedEx Corp on Wednesday posted lower-than-expected quarterly earnings as results at its FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight units missed estimates, and it reiterated an outlook analysts consider conservative, sending its stock down nearly 5 percent.Both FedEx and main rival United Parcel Service Inc are in the final days of their peak holiday season, which has boomed over the past decade due to the rise of e-commerce. Last year both companies were hit by a last-minute surge in online orders and bad weather, leaving an estimated 2 million packages undelivered on Christmas Eve. The two companies have worked with online retailers in hopes of avoiding a repeat of last year. So far the plans appeared to be paying off.On a conference call with analysts, FedEx executives said labor problems at West Coast ports this year had left cargo shipments backed up over the last three months, causing inventory shortages. Memphis, Tennessee-based FedEx reported net income of $616 million, or $2.14 per share, for the second quarter ended Nov. 30, up from $500 million, or $1.57 a share, a year earlier.  Analysts on average had expected $2.22 a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue totaled $11.9 billion, below expectations of $11.99 billion, and was up in all of FedEx's major business segments. Volumes at FedEx Ground in the United States were up 7 percent for the quarter, but revenue per package fell 2 percent due in part to lower fuel surcharges, which decline as fuel prices come down. Package volumes were up 5 percent in the international economy business and rose 1 percent in the international priority business. FedEx said it benefited from an ongoing profit improvement plan, falling fuel prices and lower pension expenses, partly offset by aircraft maintenance costs.The company still expects earnings per share of $8.50 to $9.00 for the year ending May 31.

95,"   By Deepa Seetharaman | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Dec 26 Major U.S. retailers missed fewer Christmas deliveries this year, according to two small, early surveys released on Friday, partly reflecting a year's worth of investments made to avoid 2013's last-minute shipping debacle.This year, 7 percent of packages ordered online did not arrive by their promised delivery date, compared with 12 percent in 2013, according to a survey of 160 orders placed by retail-intelligence firm StellaService.Separately, management consulting firm Kurt Salmon said 13 percent of the nearly 100 e-commerce orders it surveyed did not make it in time for Christmas, down from 15 percent in 2013.In 2013, some 2 million express packages were left stranded on Christmas Eve, according to shipment-tracking software developer ShipMatrix Inc. The reasons given were, in part, a surge in demand triggered by last-minute online promotions and bad weather.This year, retailers pushed back the cut-off date for Christmas delivery by one day, but most were still able to hit the mark because of improvements to their logistics infrastructure, better weather and fewer last-minute deals. ""We saw a lot less of the 11th-hour promotions,"" said Steve Osburn, director of supply chain for Kurt Salmon. ""They may have extended their deadline by about a day, but they were a little less aggressive about pushing those promotions.""Retailers set a Christmas cut-off delivery date between Dec. 19 and Dec. 20 this year, he said. The four retailers with the most aggressive cutoff date of Dec. 23 - Apple Inc, Dell Inc, Nordstrom Inc and Zappos, a unit of Amazon.com Inc - all made their deadlines, StellaService said.The better results also stemmed from the heavy investments by United Parcel Service Inc and FedEx Corp, the world's two largest shipping companies. UPS allocated $500 million to expand and improve its 2014 holiday operations. Both built new facilities, added more temporary workers and pushed retailers for clearer estimates and earlier deadlines to avoid last year's missteps.The level of communication between carriers and retailers was ""significantly higher"" this year, Osburn said, pointing to a retail client who, in the run-up to Christmas, heard from one carrier two to three times a day. But both surveys found that some retailers still fell short of their promises, reflecting the difficulty of accurately calculating holiday demand as e-commerce orders grow rapidly.StellaService found nine of the top 40 retailers it tested missed delivery dates: Best Buy Co Inc, Costco Wholesale Corp, Crate & Barrel, J.C. Penney Co Inc, Kohl's Corp , Macy's Inc, Staples Inc, Toys 'R Us and Wayfair Inc.Best Buy declined to comment. The other retailers were not immediately available for comment.Both Staples and Toys 'R Us missed deliveries in multiple regions in the United States, and in one case, Staples canceled an order without notifying the shopper, StellaService said.Osburn found one case where a retailer fell behind on orders and attempted to upgrade shipping on packages to make the Christmas deadline. But the volume was three to four times higher than its previous estimates, and the retailer missed the Christmas deadline, Osburn said, declining to name the company.

96,"   By Nick Carey | CHICAGO  CHICAGO United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) and FedEx Corp (FDX.N) are rolling out new pricing systems to curb online retailers' large package sizes, but industry experts warn many small firms are unprepared and could pay up to 50 percent more for shipping.Starting Monday, UPS will no longer charge for U.S. ground packages under 3 cubic feet by weight but by their ""dimensional weight.""Memphis-based FedEx will roll out the same change on Jan 5.Instead of simply weighing a box, retailers must multiply its length by its height and width, and then divide that by 166 to reach its dimensional weight.""We believe this (dimensional weight pricing) will encourage customers to reduce their package sizes,"" Bill Smith, UPS vice president of marketing, told Reuters. UPS and FedEx announced the change in May and have worked to help customers adjust. But some small firms lack the resources to change packaging and may switch to the U.S. Postal Service (USPS), said Amine Khechfe, general manager of Endicia, which offers shipping solutions for e-commerce vendors.Under the new systems, according to Endicia, a woman's shoulder bag weighing 2 pounds – shipped in a box measuring 19 by 15 by 5 inches - will have a dimensional weight of 9 pounds and cost 45 percent more to ship.Atlanta-based UPS says retailers are shipping lighter goods, but have not shrunk the size of their packaging materials. ""We need to charge a fair value for use of our asset, which in this case is space,"" FedEx spokesman Jess Bunn told Reuters.Online retailers such as Amazon (AMZN.O) are expected to be prepared. But smaller firms like Oregon-based Natura Health Products would struggle: It expects to pay 36 percent more for shipping many packages.  Natura sells nutritional supplement products, many for cancer patients, and spends about $180,000 a year on shipping through FedEx and USPS, said logistics manager Chris Thorsen. To avoid such increases, the company will shift more shipping business in 2015 to USPS. The share shipped by USPS will rise to about 50 percent from 40 percent in 2014.The USPS still charges by weight. In July, it announced some price cuts to target e-commerce.Research firm Morningstar estimates e-commerce will grow at least 10 percent annually over the next five years.

106,"  (Adds FedEx announcement, analyst comment, updates stock price)By Nick CareyCHICAGO Jan 23 United Parcel Service Inc  on Friday said its fourth-quarter performance was hurt as lackluster holiday demand pushed up costs, and that it will likely raise prices for this year's peak season.The world's largest package delivery company, citing a disappointing performance in U.S. domestic ground shipments,  said its fourth-quarter earnings per share would come in below market expectations.The comments sent UPS shares down 9.2 percent to $103.73 at midday.""Clearly, our financial performance during the quarter was disappointing,"" UPS Chief Executive Officer David Abney said in a regulatory filing. ""Going forward, we will reduce operating costs and implement new pricing strategies during peak season."" UPS also said 2015 earnings-per-share growth would be slightly below its long-term target ranging from 9 percent to 13 percent.In a separate announcement, main rival FedEx reaffirmed its earnings outlook for its fiscal 2015 year ending May 31.During the 2013 peak season UPS and FedEx Corp were hit by a late surge in online orders that left an estimated 2 million packages stranded on Christmas Eve. Both companies worked last year to avoid a repeat. UPS spent $500 million on network improvements to handle anticipated growth in e-commerce shipments. The Atlanta-based company expects earnings of approximately $1.25 per share for the fourth quarter. Analysts estimated $1.47.Its international business was also hurt by one-time charges and negative foreign exchange comparisons. UPS also said it will take a noncash, aftertax charge of $670 million related to its pension plans. The company said it prepared its network to handle a spike in package volumes on Cyber Monday and on its peak day, Dec. 22. But demand was less than expected on those days.As a result, UPS was hurt by a decline in productivity and extra costs it incurred on those days.""I think UPS was so concerned about the horrible 2013 they over-planned for 2014, and voila, they spent too much money and hired too many people to handle what wound up being a muddled peak,"" said Helane Becker, an analyst at Cowen & Company.Becker said the peak season was also affected by the slowdown at West Coast ports, a problem FedEx highlighted in a Dec. 17 earnings conference call.She said raising peak prices was a smart move under the circumstances, but added some large customers will push back.

121,"  Grizzlies bounce back to defeat BucksMEMPHIS, Tenn. -- After getting a reboot during the end of a forgettable Eastern road swing, the Memphis Grizzlies regained their balance as a team and rolled to a 96-83 win over the Milwaukee Bucks on Saturday night before a sellout crowd of 18,119 at FedEx Forum.Grizzlies coach Dave Joerger sat center Mark Gasol, power forward Zach Randolph, point guard Mike Conley and dervish Tony Allen on Thursday while Memphis endured a 20-point national TV loss at Washington.On Saturday, a sputtering Grizzlies offense found a modest spark by the end of the first quarter and by game's end, everybody seemed to get into the act.All five Grizzlies starters finished in double figures, led by 17 points from struggling shooting guard Courtney Lee and 15 each from forwards Jeff Green and Randolph.""I came in (on the off day) and got in extra shots. We all got to rest and recover a bit,"" Lee said. ""I'd been getting open shots, but I needed to see a few go in yesterday, and once we hit some today, we got confidence. It also allowed us to set up our defense.""Memphis coach Dave Joerger said, ""Lee got open looks and with him as this focal point sets the table for so many other guys.""Beno Udrih, subbing for Conley (ankle sprain) at the point, had 15 points and Gasol had 12 points, seven rebounds and seven assists despite missing some of the first half with a knee tweak. The Grizzlies shot 47.4 percent from the field and were 8 of 14 from 3-point range, getting two each from Green, Lee, Udrih and guard Vince Carter.""For us, where we are, I thought we took a step forward tonight. ... It's not about trying to get wins; it's trying to play as well as we can,"" Joerger said.The Bucks, who have lost eight straight on the road, were led by 19 points from forward Giannis Antetotokounmpo, including 13 in the first half. Guard Khris Middleton added 17, center Zaza Pachulia 14 and forward Ersan Ilyasova 12. Michael Carter-Williams, who hurt his ankle in Orlando then came back with 28 points in an overtime loss at Indiana Thursday, was a late scratch Saturday. Tyler Ennis got the start and dished out 11 assists to go with seven points.""It wasn't a setback. The next guy was up and I thought Tyler played a great game,"" Bucks coach Jason Kidd said. ""I thought some of our guys got better tonight.""But after the Bucks closed to 63-58 early in the third quarter, they were never a factor. The Grizzlies went on a 15-3 run to close the quarter, sparked by two buckets from Randolph and then a feed to Allen for a three-point play.""We gave ourselves a chance (in the third quarter) but didn't take advantage,"" Ennis said. ""We have to do a better job of that."" Kidd said, ""The second and third quarters we have been struggling a little bit getting stops. ... We have to look at getting a little bit tired defensively.""The Bucks got the first punch in, bolting to a 14-4 lead behind six quick points from Antetotokounmpo. Memphis continued a trend of flat-footed starts, turning the ball over four times in the first four minutes.But a couple of mid-range jumpers each from Udrih and Lee led to a burst of muscle by Randolph, and that seemed to oil the gears for the Grizzlies, who chased the Bucks down and took a 22-20 lead by the end of the quarter.Memphis stretched the lead to double digits in the second quarter before a couple of late 3-pointers helped Milwaukee close to 49-42 at the break.Gasol left the game with 3:11 left in the second quarter after tweaking his right knee on a collision. He went to the dressing room briefly but came back, scored three buckets and also finished the half with five assists.NOTES: The Grizzlies limped home after a 1-3 trip that ended with coach Dave Joerger sitting Gasol, Randolph, Conley and Allen in a 107-87 loss at Washington. ""You don't do that for short-term response but more long-term. We'd been scaling back their minutes already,"" said Joerger, whose team had played eight games in 12 days. ""What you do hope to see when they come back is some energy and fight."" ... Conley was inactive for the second straight game with an ankle sprain suffered in Wednesday's loss at Boston. ""He's day to day, and I'm in no hurry,"" Joerger said of Conley. ... Grizzlies F Jon Leuer (back contusion) did not play Saturday. Former Grizzlies G O.J. Mayo came back from a hamstring but struggled offensively, while backup G Jerryd Bayless, who also once played in Memphis, sat out again with an ankle injury. It was a game-time decision. ... The Grizzlies are 7-6 since the All-Star break, while Milwaukee is 4-9. ... The Grizzlies are home Monday night against Denver, while the Bucks travel to New Orleans to try and snap a 12-game losing streak against the Pelicans.",2015-03-15,FDX,"Sat Mar 14, 2015 | 10:55pm EDT",Grizzlies bounce back to defeat Bucks,http://www.reuters.com//article/bkn-bucks-grizzlies-writethru-idUSMTZEB3F8F6XE520150315?type=companyNews
122,"   By Nick Carey  Package delivery company FedEx Corp (FDX.N) reported a better-than-expected quarterly net profit on Wednesday but forecast full-year earnings below analysts' estimates as it looked for the global economy to grow at a lackluster rate.Memphis-based FedEx also said fuel expenses were reduced by 30 percent due to low oil prices but its international business was hurt by falling fuel surcharges and the strong dollar.The quarter included the company's crucial peak holiday season in the United States. ""We had a very successful peak season as volumes grew across all our segments,"" Chief Executive Officer Fred Smith said on a conference call with analysts.Last month, FedEx's main rival, United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N), reported a disappointing quarterly profit due to soaring costs during peak season. Atlanta-based UPS mobilized more workers and equipment for an anticipated surge in holiday packages, but the extra business failed to materialize, forcing the company to begin applying surcharges for residential packages during this year's peak season.FedEx's operating expenses rose just 1 percent during the quarter, while UPS' expenses jumped nearly 16 percent during the fourth quarter, which also included a charge related to pensions.  FedEx said on its earnings call it expects the U.S. economy to grow at a rate of 3.1 percent in both 2015 and 2016.FedEx said fiscal third-quarter net profit soared 53 percent to $580 million, or $2.01 per share, from $378 million, or $1.23 per share, a year earlier. Analysts expected earnings per share of $1.87.Revenue for the quarter ended Feb. 28 totaled $11.7 billion, up nearly 4 percent from $11.3 billion a year earlier. Analysts estimated $11.79 billion. The company expects full-year earnings in a range of $8.80 to $8.95 per share, which it said ""assumes continued moderate global economic growth."" Analysts have been looking for earnings of $8.97 for the full fiscal year ending May 31. FedEx said package volumes in its international economy business were up 4 percent during the quarter, while daily volumes in its U.S. ground package delivery business rose 7 percent. The company said average daily volume for its less expensive SmartPost product fell 7 percent due to reduced business from a major customer. Revenue in the express business was flat at $6.66 billion due to lower fuel surcharges and the stronger U.S. dollar. But revenue at the U.S. ground package delivery and freight units rose 12 percent and 6 percent, respectively. In early trading, FedEx shares were down 1.1 percent at $173.95.

129,"   By Ryan Vlastelica | NEW YORK  NEW YORK The U.S. dollar rose more than 1 percent on Tuesday, resuming a recent upward trend and weighing on Wall Street stocks as investors fretted the currency's strength would hurt multinational corporate profits.U.S. equities had traded higher for much of the session but turned negative in the final hour of trading. European shares ended sharply higher, as did crude oil.Recent market activity has favored risk assets, a move tied to Friday's weaker-than-expected U.S. payrolls report. While the data, along with other recent indicators, pointed to slowing U.S. growth, market participants viewed them positively, as they suggested the U.S. Federal Reserve would delay its first interest rate increase in nearly a decade. The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, rose 1.22 percent on Tuesday. Until recently, the dollar had rallied sharply on increased expectations for higher rates from the U.S. central bank, although those expectations have dimmed somewhat of late.  While a strong U.S. dollar is a sign of solid fundamentals, analysts are concerned that the currency will weigh on the earnings of U.S. multinational companies. Bank of America-Merrill Lynch on Tuesday cut its 2015 earnings estimates for the S&P 500 by $2 a share, citing the foreign exchange headwind.""If the (dollar) move is gradual it shouldn't impact stocks too much, as companies will have a chance to hedge against the impact, but a sharp rise will have an impact,"" said Tony Roth, chief investment officer of Wilmington Trust in Wilmington, Delaware. It ""acts as a natural brake to the U.S., and we expect it will continue to strengthen."" The Dow Jones industrial average fell 5.43 points, or 0.03 percent, to 17,875.42, the S&P 500 lost 4.29 points, or 0.21 percent, to 2,076.33 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 7.08 points, or 0.14 percent, to 4,910.23.The MSCI International ACWI Price Index slipped 0.16 percent.The S&P 500 rose as much as 0.4 percent earlier in the session, boosted by FedEx Corp's offer to buy TNT Express for $4.8 billion, the latest in a series of multi-billion-dollar deals that suggest companies continue to see value. The potential trans-Atlantic takeover supported European shares, with the pan-European FTSEurofirst index of leading 300 shares closing 1.6 percent higher. Europe, which was closed Monday for Easter, was also fueled by comments from Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis, who on Sunday said the country intended ""to meet all obligations to all its creditors, ad infinitum,"" seeking to quell fears of a default.The euro fell 1 percent while the yen lost 0.7 percent against the dollar. Bucking the U.S. dollar's strength, the Australian dollar rose 0.54 percent after the country's central bank surprised some by leaving interest rates at a record low 2.25 percent. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note rose 4/32 in price, pushing the yield down to 1.8865 percent. In commodities, U.S. crude oil futures jumped 3.5 percent to settle at $53.98 per barrel, recovering from an earlier drop of more than 2 percent and building on a rise of more than 6 percent on Monday. Prices were boosted by U.S. government forecasts of lower domestic crude production growth, higher global demand for oil and data showing a jump in U.S. job openings.Brent crude rose 1.7 percent to settle at $59.10 per barrel.Gold prices fell 0.4 percent as the dollar rebounded.

132,"   By Toby Sterling and Thomas Escritt | AMSTERDAM  AMSTERDAM FedEx Corp (FDX.N) is to buy Dutch package delivery firm TNT Express TNTE.AS for an agreed 4.4 billion euros ($4.8 billion), stepping up the challenge to rivals United Parcel Service (UPS.N) and Deutsche Post (DPWGn.DE) in Europe.European regulators blocked a 2013 takeover of TNT by UPS due to concerns it would stifle competition, but analysts and executives said on Tuesday FedEx, with its strong air fleet, would complement TNT's sizeable European road network.""Europe, despite the fact that there has been low growth, is still an enormous market both for import and export,"" FedEx Corp. (FDX.N) Chief Executive Fred Smith told analysts.TNT gives FedEx access to pan-European service and the domestic UK and French markets, areas where it is not yet a big player, Smith said, while TNT customers will get access to FedEx's global distribution platform.ING analysts estimate Deutsche Post's DHL currently has a 19 percent market share in Europe, followed by UPS with 16 percent, TNT with 12 percent and FedEx at 5 percent -- meaning the deal could catapult FedEx to second place.FedEx will offer 8 euros in cash per ordinary TNT share -- a 33 percent premium on last week's close, though below UPS's 2013 offer of 9.5 euros. Memphis, Tennessee-based FedEx is financing the deal with debt, the latest company to take advantage of low interest rates.TNT shares were up nearly 30 percent on Tuesday, close to FedEx's bid price, while FedEx stock rose 3.6 percent. ""FedEx has laid on the table an attractive offer price,"" said ABN Amro analyst Maarten Bakker, who has a ""hold"" rating on TNT shares. ""With FedEx having always been the most logical predator of TNT Express, we see the chances of a competing offer as slim.""FedEx finance chief Alan Graf said the company would ""be very aggressive on spending on integration in the first year,"" and the deal would create unspecified cost synergies.The deal has been unanimously recommended by TNT's supervisory board. TNT's largest shareholder, PostNL (PTNL.AS), also said it would tender its 14.7 percent stake to FedEx. PostNL shares rose 17 percent. ""SMART MOVE"" European regulators' decision to block UPS's bid for TNT dealt a blow to the Dutch firm, which had been counting on adopting much of UPS's logistics backbone. TNT, whose European market share has slumped by as much as 5 percentage points since that deal fell apart, has cut costs, sold operations and invested in its road network in an effort to hold on to customers in a weak European market for business package deliveries. ""There is no regulatory risk whatsoever,"" said Kepler Cheuvreux analyst Andre Mulder of the proposed FedEx deal, calling the offer fair in view of TNT's weaker market position.""FedEx made a smart move and their rivals can do virtually nothing,"" he added.FedEx's decision to bid followed a 17 percent drop in TNT shares over the past year, versus a 21 percent rise in the benchmark Dutch AEX index. A stronger U.S. dollar against the euro will also have worked in the U.S. firm's favor. TNT warned in February it expected tough trading to continue in its main western European markets.($1 = 0.9156 euros) (Additional reporting by Thomas Escritt and Anthony Deutsch in Amsterdam, Nick Carey in Chicago and Rama Venkat Raman in Bangalore; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman, Mark Potter and Susan Thomas)",2015-04-07,FDX,"Tue Apr 7, 2015 | 3:08pm EDT",FedEx to buy TNT for $4.8 billion to take on rivals in Europe,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-tnt-express-m-a-fedex-idUSKBN0MY06G20150407?type=companyNews
133,"   By Nick Carey | CHICAGO  CHICAGO FedEx Corp's $4.8 billion bid Tuesday for TNT Express took the world's last large potential package delivery acquisition target off the table, marking a victory in FedEx's battle to gain market share from rival United Parcel Service Inc.If FedEx wins regulatory approval for the proposed acquisition, it would pull into the No. 2 spot among package delivery services in Europe with a 17 percent market share. That would put it ahead of UPS in Europe, but leave Deutsche Post's DHL with the lead at 19 percent of the market.For FedEx, this is a case where being No. 2 could be an advantage. In 2013, European regulators blocked a $6.9 billion bid from Atlanta-based UPS, the world's largest package delivery company, for TNT on grounds that the combined companies would have more than 30 percent of the European market.FedEx has a better shot at getting regulatory approval, analysts say, in part because TNT has lost share since the UPS bid. ""It looks like FedEx came in and got something that UPS couldn't,"" said John Haber, chief executive of Spend Management Experts, which helps clients reduce supply chain spending. ""It looks like FedEx paid a lot less and it puts them in a sweet position."" UPS has said it will not renew its bid for TNT and last year said it would invest $1 billion over four years in expansion projects to grow its business organically.     FedEx has had a good run recently against UPS. UPS had a second consecutive poor peak season in 2014, as it overspent to compensate for being stuck with a glut of packages on Christmas Eve 2013. FedEx experienced no such problems.“FedEx is currently better positioned and is doing a better job of executing,” said Jim Corridore, an equity research director at S&P Capital IQ. If regulators give FedEx's TNT offer the nod, it would leave no other major package delivery firm as targets for DHL, UPS or FedEx, which have global market shares of 41 percent, 25 percent and up to 22 percent, including TNT, respectively.""There's really nothing juicy left out there to buy,"" said Helane Becker, a Cowen & Co analyst. Morningstar analyst Keith Schoonmaker said acquisitions by the two package delivery firms from now on may focus on growing other parts of their business, such as contract logistics, logistics or freight forwarding. ""Unless a large package business develops independently in Asia, all that's left out there are small, regional players,"" Schoonmaker said. The barriers to entry for a major new package delivery company are high. A potential rival to the three global leaders would need to own an airline, a prohibitive obstacle for most firms.

PostNL has said it would sell its 14.7 percent stake to FedEx.Royal Mail, Deutsche Post and Kuehne & Nagel gained 1.3-2.6 percent.

The two stocks gained 1.2 percent and 0.9 percent respectively.The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares closed up 1.6 percent at 1,612.25 points, tracking a rally on Wall Street after Friday's surprisingly weak U.S. jobs data sparked expectations the Federal Reserve could hold off longer on raising interest rates.""The disappointment on the U.S. jobs figures is prompting investors to rethink the scenario of a first rate hike in June, which is good news for the market,"" Barclays France portfolio manager Philippe Cohen said.

138,"  * European stocks hit highest since July 2007* $70 bln oil & gas mega-merger drives shares up* Federal Reserve minutes eyed* Greek PM Tsipras in MoscowBy Jamie McGeeverLONDON, April 8 Global stocks remained upbeat on Wednesday as a $70 billion mega-deal in the European oil and gas sector stoked the merger and acquisition fever that has gripped investors this week.Shares in BG Group rose as much as 42 percent in early trade after Royal Dutch Shell agreed to pay that amount (47 billion pounds) for its smaller rival, making it the biggest deal in the sector in more than a decade.Germany was the main exception, where shares slipped after data showed that industrial orders surprisingly fell in February.In early trading Europe's EuroFirst 300 index of leading shares was up 0.3 percent at 1,617 points. This followed Tuesday's 1.6 percent rise, the market's biggest gain since Jan. 23.Britain's FTSE 100, of which energy shares are a major component, was up 0.6 percent at 7,002 points. Shares in Shell fell more than 2 percent but BP was up more than 4 percent. ""We have been buying the oil majors over the last couple of weeks. There is a bit of weakness in Shell this morning due to the very high premium that Shell is offering, but in the long-term, this does look like creating a business that will be well-positioned within the energy sector,"" said Dafydd Davies, partner at Charles Hanover Investments.Elsewhere, Vivendi is looking at a possible acquisition of pay-TV group Sky, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters, in a deal that could cost the French media conglomerate up to 28 billion pounds.Following FedEx Corp's 4.4 billion euro ($4.8 billion) bid to buy Dutch package delivery company TNT Express  on Tuesday, investors shunned the temptation to cash in on a decent run for Europe's main indexes in recent days.Earlier in Asia, Japanese stocks rose 0.8 percent to a fresh 15-year high after the Bank of Japan's latest policy meeting. Some investors were disappointed no fresh stimulus was announced, but with inflation near zero expectations are high that more will come at its next meeting.Hong Kong and Chinese markets both hit seven-year peaks, while MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan gained 1.2 percent to its highest since mid-September. Futures pointed to a higher open on Wall Street too.FED MINUTES IN FOCUS In currency markets the dollar took a breather after rising more than 1 percent on Tuesday, its biggest gain in almost a month. The euro rose 0.5 percent to $1.0870, sterling was up 0.6 percent at $1.4895 and the dollar slipped a third of one percent against the yen to 119.86 yen.Markets continue to readjust expectations on the timing of the Federal Reserve's first interest rate rise since June 2006. Last Friday's weak jobs report for March prompted many observers to strike June off as a potential date for ""lift-off"".Minutes from the Fed's last policy meeting released later on Wednesday will be scrutinised closely for clues on the timing. Reflecting the uncertainty, Goldman Sachs economists said they are sticking with September but admit December is an increasingly ""close call"".The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield was one basis point lower on Wednesday at 1.87 percent, while the comparable German yield was two basis points lower at 0.16 percent after the 0.9 percent fall in German industrial orders in February.European bond traders will also pay close attention to demand at Germany's two-year, zero percent bond auction later on Wednesday, and headlines from Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras's visit to Russia.Athens has not asked Moscow for financial aid, a Greek government spokesman said on Wednesday, a day before Greece is due to due to repay a loan tranche of around 450 million euros to the International Monetary Fund.In commodities, oil pared recent gains after Saudi Arabia reported record production of 10.3 million barrels per day in March, a figure the country's oil minister said was unlikely to fall by much.U.S. May crude fell 2.5 percent to $52.71 a barrel while Brent shed 1.6 percent to $58.14.Gold got a boost from the weaker dollar and edged up a couple of bucks to $1,210 an ounce.

139,"   By Nick Carey | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Package delivery giant UPS does not expect to change its current expansion plan in Europe despite a recent acquisition bid by main rival FedEx that would knock the firm into third place on the continent, a top executive said on Tuesday.Last year UPS announced a four-year, $1 billion investment to grow its European network. Earlier this month, its main rival, FedEx Corp (FDX.N), announced it would buy Dutch package delivery firm TNT Express TNTE.AS. A 2013 UPS bid to buy TNT was blocked by European regulators.If FedEx's acquisition of TNT is approved, it would become the second-largest package delivery firm in Europe behind Deutsche Post's (DPWGn.DE) DHL but ahead of UPS. Speaking after UPS posted a better-than-expected quarterly net profit and reaffirmed its 2015 earnings outlook, chief financial officer Kurt Kuehn told Reuters that FedEx's bid for TNT had not changed UPS' plans.""We're continuing at full speed with our expansions plans,"" said Kuehn, who is due to retire this summer. ""Actually Europe was one of the stars of the show in the (first) quarter.""Export volumes in Europe at UPS rose over 9 percent in the quarter and Kuehn said the company's compound annual growth over the past decade has also been around 9 percent.  ""We're going to keep on doing what we can to compete in that environment,"" he said.While many publicly traded companies have complained about the impact of the strong dollar as overseas sales in foreign currencies translate into lower revenue at home, UPS said it had hedges in place on major currencies that should protect it until the end of 2016.  But Kuehn said that UPS is unprotected in minor currencies, which should be a slight drag for the company this year. At the start of 2015 UPS expected that would affect revenue by $50 million this year, but it now puts that figure at $70 million.What UPS is more concerned about moving forward is the impact of the strong dollar on U.S. exports, Kuehn said. Although he said it was hard to predict exactly how much its U.S. customers would be affected, the strength of the dollar would continue to act as a headwind for exports, he said.

150,"  * Fed says economy strong enough to handle rate hike* Oracle slides after the bell on revenue miss* FedEx down after results* Indexes up: Dow 0.17 pct, S&P 0.2 pct, Nasdaq 0.18 pct   (Updates to close)By Rodrigo CamposJune 17 U.S. stocks ended slightly higher following a choppy session Wednesday after the Federal Reserve said the U.S. economy is likely strong enough to withstand an interest rate hike later this year.Even if a majority of Fed officials continue to see higher rates by the end of 2015, they expect rates to rise slightly less by the end of 2016 and 2017 than they did in their March forecasts.That view on rates saw high-yielding stocks gain, with the S&P 500 utilities sector up 0.9 percent after hitting on Tuesday its lowest since late September. Stocks with higher dividend yields attract investors when there is an expectation that Treasury yields will fall, or in this case, remain relatively low.""The Fed is talking about the labor market tightening somewhat, which seems to be a hint that it is a step closer to raising rates. At the same time, it seems like there was a notching down of the magnitude of rate hike expectations,"" said Nick Kalivas, senior equity product strategist at Invesco PowerShares in Downers Grove, Illinois.""Those two things are what is causing stocks to go back and forth.""Major indexes were volatile following the Fed statement. Stocks initially added to losses, then hit session highs as Fed Chair Janet Yellen spoke to the media in a follow-up to the statement. They lost more than half the day's gains at the close.

The shares, which had briefly hit a record high of $580.57 overnight, closed at $529.42. It is all in a day's work - or a night's sleep - for Bezos, who owned 83.92 million shares, or roughly 18 percent of Amazon's outstanding stock of May 14.His stake easily dwarfs those of other insiders. Diego Piacentini, senior vice president of international consumer business, is the second-largest insider holder behind Bezos, with 110,000 shares. Jeffrey Wilke, senior VP of consumer business, owns 80,000 shares. The stake held by Bezos would hold a market cap of about $48.6 billion on its own, which is bigger than S&P 500  names such as FedEx Corp, Caterpillar Inc and Netflix Inc.

It is too soon to tell whether Bezos was up overnight selling some of his highest-priced shares, but an examination of his filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission show he has been slowly cutting his stake, mainly by donating stock to charity.

171,"  Aug 3 A challenge by U.S. airlines that accuses three Gulf carriers of distorting competition via government subsidies took another turn on Monday with the formation of a U.S. airline group that backs the Gulf-carriers' cause.Four long-time supporters of U.S. Open Skies agreements with Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, which remove restrictions on flying to and from those states, have formally banded together to create the U.S. Airlines for Open Skies Coalition. They are the air cargo unit of FedEx Corp, JetBlue Airways Corp , Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings Inc and Hawaiian Holdings Inc.""We thought it was important that the government understand that there are many different voices in this choir,"" JetBlue's general counsel, James Hnat, told reporters Monday in announcing  a letter from the group to the Obama administration.The letter comes just hours before the U.S. government closes a public comment period on Aug. 3 asking for views on whether Emirates, Etihad Airways and Qatar Airways have dumped capacity and begun pushing competitors out of key markets via $42 billion in subsidies over the past decade. Each Gulf carrier has denied the subsidy claims. A coalition representing American Airlines Group Inc , Delta Air Lines Inc, United Continental Holdings Inc and seven airline unions - known as the Partnership for Open and Fair Skies - has called on the Obama administration to initiate consultations with the Gulf states to address the alleged subsidies.The Partnership's spokeswoman, Jill Zuckman, called the new U.S. group ""a meaningless coalition without a cause."" A majority of comments submitted to the U.S. government have backed the Partnership, according to the group. The carriers in the new coalition have benefited from the Open Skies agreements in question: for example, FedEx Express has a hub in Dubai, and JetBlue has seen a boost in passenger traffic from a relationship with Emirates that feeds the New York-based airline many international customers.(Reporting By Jeffrey Dastin in New York; Editing by Steve Orlofsky)",2015-08-03,FDX,"Mon Aug 3, 2015 | 4:50pm EDT",New U.S. airline group backs Gulf carriers in Open Skies dispute,http://www.reuters.com//article/airlines-competition-idUSL1N10E22020150803?type=companyNews

Raw materials can now be delivered around the country.""The servi-cha are another example of a growing tolerance for private enterprise within North Korea, where informal markets and small trading firms have burgeoned in recent years alongside a creaking centrally-planned Soviet-style economy.Trains were long North Korea's principle mode of transport, but poor electricity supply and ageing rolling stock have left them slow and unreliable. That leaves a rusty fleet of old buses plying the country's lightly-trafficked and dusty roads as the most effective means for moving goods between cities and small towns, according to North Korean defectors and experts. Internal travel remains restricted in authoritarian North Korea and vehicles cannot officially be privately owned, but defectors say goods loaded on buses are off the regime's radar, especially outside Pyongyang, the showpiece capital.Entrepreneurs can partner with state organizations to register buses on their behalf and share the profits, according to a 2014 paper from the Korea Institute for Industrial Economics and Trade in Sejong, South Korea.The report, partly based on interviews with defectors, said servi-cha are often operated by local government bodies, giving them a semi-official status that suits the growing ranks of small traders that use them. CASH AND CARRY Some sites used as once-informal drop-off points for buses have had permanent structures built within the last few years, according to Curtis Melvin, a researcher who studies publicly available satellite imagery of the country at the Johns Hopkins School for Advanced International Studies in Washington.Private markets began taking hold in North Korea following a devastating famine in the 1990s, when the state distribution system broke down.The size of spaces used as markets has significantly expanded since 2004, Melvin said, as have the bus depots supporting the delivery network.  ""This didn't start under Kim Jong Un, but there's been a lot of growth under him,"" said Melvin, referring to North Korea's young leader, who took power following the death in 2011 of his father, Kim Jong Il.Using servi-cha, a rice vendor who needs to replenish supplies when none are locally available can phone a wholesaler in another city and place an order. The wholesaler delivers rice to the local depot, where a bus ships it to the buyer's town.To pay for the rice, the buyer visits a small money transfer business, which takes the payment and calls a partner business in the seller's town - one in 10 North Koreans has a cellphone - who confirms the deal and hands cash to the seller.By reliably accepting cash in advance, servi-cha have helped foster the concept of trust in business in North Korea, said another defector who stays in touch with family in the North and asked to be anonymous for the safety of her relatives still living there.""Logistics with buses are like vessels which keep pumping blood around the country and stop people from starving to death,"" said Kim, the first defector.

The size of spaces used as markets has significantly expanded since 2004, Melvin said, as have the bus depots supporting the delivery network.""This didn't start under Kim Jong Un, but there's been a lot of growth under him,"" said Melvin, referring to North Korea's young leader, who took power following the death in 2011 of his father, Kim Jong Il.Using servi-cha, a rice vendor who needs to replenish supplies when none are locally available can phone a wholesaler in another city and place an order. The wholesaler delivers rice to the local depot, where a bus ships it to the buyer's town.To pay for the rice, the buyer visits a small money transfer business, which takes the payment and calls a partner business in the seller's town - one in 10 North Koreans has a cellphone - who confirms the deal and hands cash to the seller.By reliably accepting cash in advance, servi-cha have helped foster the concept of trust in business in North Korea, said another defector who stays in touch with family in the North and asked to be anonymous for the safety of her relatives still living there.""Logistics with buses are like vessels which keep pumping blood around the country and stop people from starving to death,"" said Kim, the first defector. ""This is something that the planned economy can't do.""(Editing by Tony Munroe and Alex Richardson)",2015-09-10,FDX,"Thu Sep 10, 2015 | 5:00pm EDT","In North Korea, deals on the bus make markets go round",http://www.reuters.com//article/northkorea-change-buses-idUSL4N11912K20150910?type=companyNews

FedEx said its U.S. domestic package business revenue rose 29 percent, but freight unit revenue was flat and was down 4 percent in its international package unit due to the strong U.S. dollar and lower fuel surcharge revenue.The company reported revenue for the quarter of $12.3 billion versus $11.7 billion a year earlier, in line with analyst estimates.

203,"  AMSTERDAM Feb 5 TNT Express will sell its airline operations to ASL Aviation Group to comply with European Union rules if the Dutch logistics company's sale to larger rival FedEx goes ahead, the company said on Friday.The company said it needed to sell TNT Airways and Pan Air Lineas Aereas to comply with EU airline ownership and control roles after FedEx's 4.4 billion euro ($4.90 billion) acquisition of the company.Under EU rules, foreign investors cannot own more than 49 percent of a European airline and control of the company must remain in EU hands. Ireland-based ASL, a global cargo, passenger and leasing company, will continue to operate flights for TNT following its acquisition by FedEx under a multi-year service agreement. Its fleet will grow from 90 to 130 aircraft after the sale. With a European market share of 17 percent, the combined FedEx-TNT will be Europe's second-biggest delivery services business, behind Deutsche Post's DHL but ahead of UPS . The deal also strengthens FedEx's position as the world's No.3 player.

205,"   By Sai Sachin R and Mari Saito  Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) said on Wednesday it had signed a deal to lease 20 Boeing (BA.N) 767 widebody freighter aircraft to handle more of its own deliveries in the United States.The deal comes at a time when the world's biggest online retailer is offering ever-faster, and increasingly free, deliveries for millions of online orders.Amazon, which relies on carriers like United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) and FedEx Corp (FDX.N) to deliver most of its packages, spent $11.5 billion on shipping last year.In a bid to assume more control over its supply chain and reduce costs, Amazon has rolled out thousands of trailers and launched a program that uses contract drivers to deliver fast orders.But analysts said the long-rumored plan to build its own air fleet posed little threat to the leading delivery companies. ""This is an incremental negative for FDX and UPS as it will likely remove some higher yielding express freight and parcel volume from each of the respective networks,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst John Barnes wrote in a client note.UPS, the world's No. 1 package delivery company, operates about 240 large planes while FedEx has a fleet of about 370, Barnes noted. FedEx and UPS shares were down about 1.5 percent.FedEx said on Wednesday the announcement was not a surprise and called Amazon a valuable customer. ""We work closely with Amazon and have been aware for some time about their need for supplemental air capacity related to inventory management,"" said Patrick Fitzgerald, senior vice president of integrated marketing and communications at FedEx. The leased planes will start to go into operation on April 1, Amazon spokeswoman Kelly Cheeseman said in an email.Amazon has been testing deliveries by drones but has not said when they would be in service. The duration of the leases will be five to seven years, lessor Air Transport Services Group Inc (ATSG.O) said.As part of the agreement, Amazon has the right to buy up to 19.9 percent of ATSG's stock over five years at $9.73 per share.ATSG's stock soared almost 27 percent to a record high of $14.90, before paring gains to about 16 percent.

207,"   By Nick Carey | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Package delivery company FedEx Corp (FDX.N) forecast better than expected full year earnings and reported fiscal third quarter earnings that also beat analysts expectations, sending its stock up 5.0 percent in after-hours trade on Wednesday.The Memphis-based freight forwarder gave its forecast while posting quarterly results that reflected costs related to its pending acquisition of Dutch package company TNT TNTE.AS and a legal case over FedEx Ground drivers. Excluding those costs, FedEx recorded a strong performance during the quarter, despite some problems delivering packages in time for Christmas during its key holiday period. ""FedEx has demonstrated once again that it knows how to run an efficient operation during peak season,"" said Logan Purk, an analyst at Edward Jones. ""The strong results coupled with a robust outlook bodes well for the stock.""FedEx reported net income for its fiscal third quarter ending Feb. 29 of $507 million or $1.84 per share, down nearly 20 percent from $628 million or $2.18 a share a year earlier. Excluding those one-time items, the company reported a profit of $692 million or earnings per share of $2.51. Analysts on average had expected earnings per share on that basis for the quarter of $2.34.Revenue rose 9.0 percent to $12.7 billion from $11.7 billion, driven in a large part by a 30 percent jump in revenue at its FedEx Ground unit to $4.41 billion from $3.39 billion a year earlier.FedEx said it expects its full-year fiscal 2016 earnings to fall within a range of $10.70 to $10.90 per share. The company said that forecast was based on an assumption of moderate economic growth and excludes legal issues as well as any TNT-related costs or operating results. Analysts had previously forecast earnings per share of $10.52 for the full year. The European Commission approved FedEx's 4.4 billion euro ($4.8 billion) bid for TNT in January.FedEx made the bid in April 2015 and the deal should move FedEx to second place in Europe behind Deutsche Post's (DPWGn.DE) DHL. The European Commission had rejected an earlier bid for TNT from FedEx's main rival United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) on the grounds that a merger would harm competition in the European Union. During the third quarter, FedEx settled all cases related to its independent contractor model at FedEx Ground.

208,"   By Nick Carey | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Package delivery company FedEx Corp (FDX.N) forecast better than expected full year earnings and reported fiscal third quarter earnings that also beat analysts expectations, sending its stock up 5.0 percent in after-hours trade on Wednesday.The Memphis-based freight forwarder gave its forecast while posting quarterly results that reflected costs related to its pending acquisition of Dutch package company TNT TNTE.AS and a legal case over FedEx Ground drivers. Excluding those costs, FedEx recorded a strong performance during the quarter, despite some problems delivering packages in time for Christmas during its key holiday period. ""FedEx has demonstrated once again that it knows how to run an efficient operation during peak season,"" said Logan Purk, an analyst at Edward Jones. ""The strong results coupled with a robust outlook bodes well for the stock.""FedEx reported net income for its fiscal third quarter ending Feb. 29 of $507 million or $1.84 per share, down nearly 20 percent from $628 million or $2.18 a share a year earlier. Excluding those one-time items, the company reported a profit of $692 million or earnings per share of $2.51. Analysts on average had expected earnings per share on that basis for the quarter of $2.34.Revenue rose 9.0 percent to $12.7 billion from $11.7 billion, driven in a large part by a 30 percent jump in revenue at its FedEx Ground unit to $4.41 billion from $3.39 billion a year earlier.FedEx said it expects its full-year fiscal 2016 earnings to fall within a range of $10.70 to $10.90 per share. The company said that forecast was based on an assumption of moderate economic growth and excludes legal issues as well as any TNT-related costs or operating results. Analysts had previously forecast earnings per share of $10.52 for the full year. The European Commission approved FedEx's 4.4 billion euro ($4.8 billion) bid for TNT in January.FedEx made the bid in April 2015 and the deal should move FedEx to second place in Europe behind Deutsche Post's (DPWGn.DE) DHL. The European Commission had rejected an earlier bid for TNT from FedEx's main rival United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) on the grounds that a merger would harm competition in the European Union. During the third quarter, FedEx settled all cases related to its independent contractor model at FedEx Ground. The company recognized a liability for the net expected loss of $204 million related to these cases. In after-market trading FedEx shares were up 5.0 percent at $151.50.

209,"  Shares of U.S. delivery services company FedEx Corp (FDX.N) could rise another 15 to 20 percent over the next year after soaring 12 percent on Thursday, Barron's reported on Sunday.Even with last week's gain, the stock has fallen about 8 percent over the last nine months, due in part to worries that Amazon.com (AMZN.O) was looking to enter the delivery business, the financial paper said.FedEx shares closed at $163.71 on Friday.Amazon was reportedly negotiating to lease 20 jets from Boeing Co (BA.N) in December. But analysts think Amazon will probably use the planes to shift merchandise among its distribution centers, Barron's said.FedEx said on its earnings call last week that no customer accounted for more than 3 percent of revenue for any of its businesses, including express, ground and freight, much lower than many analysts had assumed, Barron's said. FedEx also said more retailers were shipping to homes from stores, rather than from distribution centers, Barron's noted. That plays into FedEx's strength in having a vast driver network, it said.FedEx has historically traded at a discount to rival United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N), Barron's said, because ground is a more lucrative business than express and FedEx is an express specialist. But FedEx's recent discount of 23 percent to UPS compares with an average of 13 percent over the past decade, Barron's said, noting that the gap is expected to grow smaller.

212,"   By Jonathan Stempel | NEW YORK  NEW YORK FedEx Corp must face a second lawsuit claiming it shipped thousands of cartons of untaxed cigarettes in New York over roughly a decade, cheating the state and New York City out of tax revenue and undercutting their efforts to curb smoking.In a decision made public on Friday, U.S. District Judge Edgardo Ramos in Manhattan rejected FedEx's bid to dismiss claims by New York State and New York City that it violated a federal anti-racketeering law and the Contraband Cigarette Trafficking Act.Ramos said FedEx must also face claims it violated its 2006 agreement with the state, later extended nationwide, not to do business with sellers that ship cigarettes to people's homes. He dismissed two other claims related to a state public health law.The judge rejected FedEx's argument that its alleged dealings with shippers such as ""Your Kentucky Tobacco Resource,"" ""Cigarettes for Less"" and ""Smokin' Joes"" was too far removed from the resulting financial harm. FedEx's alleged involvement ""was precisely the conduct that led to the plaintiffs' losing tax revenue,"" he wrote. ""The alleged scheme's entire purpose was to evade the City and State's cigarette taxing regime.""A spokesman for FedEx had no immediate comment. The office of state Attorney General Eric Schneiderman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Eric Proshansky, a lawyer for the city, said he was pleased with the decision.The lawsuit covers Memphis, Tennessee-based FedEx's dealings with 21 shippers, including some associated with Native American tribes such as Shinnecock Indian Nation. It is separate from a lawsuit by the state and city over FedEx's dealings with four other shippers.Ramos refused to dismiss that lawsuit in March 2015, and in a separate ruling on Friday narrowed FedEx's defenses to some claims it raised. Both lawsuits accuse FedEx of costing the state between $15 and $43.50 per carton, and the city $15 per carton, in excise taxes through illegal cigarette shipments.A carton usually contains 10 packs.The state and city have also sued FedEx rival United Parcel Service Inc over cigarette shipments.

But four days into a trial in San Francisco last month, the Justice Department abruptly dropped all charges. The judge commended the decision, saying it was clear FedEx was ""factually innocent.""The U.S. Attorney in San Francisco, Brian Stretch, said he has assigned the office's deputy criminal chief to a review that could take two months.

Circuit, NLRB attorney Kellie Isbell tried to convince the three-judge panel that the circuit's 2009 rejection of the board's decision about the employment status of Boston-area FedEx drivers does not prevent it from accepting the board's ruling on the Connecticut drivers, which was based on a revised standard.

250,"   By Elzio Barreto and Julie  Zhu | HONG KONG  HONG KONG Chinese logistics company ZTO Express is turning up the chance of a much more lucrative share listing at home in favor of an overseas IPO that lets its founder retain control and its investors cash out more easily.To steal a march on its rivals in the world's largest express delivery market, it is taking the quicker U.S. route to raise $1.3 billion for new warehouses and long-haul trucks to ride breakneck growth fueled by China's e-commerce boom.Its competitors SF Express, YTO Express, STO Express and Yunda Express all unveiled plans several months ago for backdoor listings in Shenzhen and Shanghai, but ZTO's head start could prove crucial, analysts and investors said.""ZTO will have a clear, certain route to raise additional capital via U.S. markets, which their competitors, assuming they all end up quoted in China, will not,"" said Peter Fuhrman, CEO of China-focused investment bank China First Capital.With a backlog of about 800 companies waiting for approval to go public in China and frequent changes to the listing rules by regulators, a New York listing is generally a quicker and more predictable way of raising funds and taps a broader mix of investors, bankers and investors said.""ZTO will have a built-in long-term competitive advantage - more reliable access to equity capital,"" Fuhrman added.U.S. rules that allow founder Meisong Lai to retain control over the company and make it easier for ZTO's private equity investors to sell their shares were some of the main reasons to go for an overseas listing, according to four people close to the company. U.S. markets allow a dual-class share structure that will give Lai 80 percent voting power in the company, even though he will only hold 28 percent of the stock after the IPO. Most of Lai's shares are Class B ordinary shares carrying 10 votes, while Class A shares, including the new U.S. shares, have one vote. China's markets do not allow shares with different voting power.ZTO's existing shareholders, including private equity firms Warburg Pincus, Hillhouse Capital and venture capital firm Sequoia Capital will also get much more leeway and flexibility to exit their investment under U.S. market rules. In China, they would be locked in for one to three years after the IPO. As concerns grow about a weakening Chinese currency, the New York IPO also gives it more stable dollar-denominated shares it can use for international acquisitions, the people close to the company said.IN DEMAND Demand for the IPO, the biggest by a Chinese company in the United States since e-commerce giant Alibaba Group's $25 billion record in 2014, already exceeds the shares on offer multiple times, two of the people said.That underscores the appeal of the fast-growing company to global investors, despite a valuation that places it above household names United Parcel Service Inc and FedEx Corp. The shares will be priced on Oct. 26 and start trading the following day.ZTO is selling 72.1 million new American Depositary Shares (ADS), equivalent to about 10 percent of its outstanding stock, in the range $16.50 to $18.50 each. The range is equal to 23.4-26.3 times its expected 2017 earnings per share, according to people familiar with the matter.By comparison, Chinese rivals SF Express, YTO Express, STO Express and Yunda shares trade between 43 and 106 times earnings, according to Haitong Securities estimates.UPS and FedEx, which are growing at a much slower pace, trade at multiples of 17.8 and 13.4 times. ""The A-share market (in China) does give you a higher valuation, but the U.S. market can help improve your transparency and corporate governance,"" said one of the people close to ZTO. ""Becoming a New York-listed company will also benefit the company in the long-term if it plans to conduct M&A overseas and seek more capital from the international market.""China's express delivery firms handled 20.7 billion parcels in 2015, shifting 1.5 times the volume in the United States, according to consulting firm iResearch data cited in the ZTO prospectus.The market will grow an average 23.7 percent a year through 2020 and reach 60 billion parcels, iResearch forecasts.Domestic rivals STO Express and YTO Express have unveiled plans to go public with reverse takeovers worth $2.5 billion and $2.6 billion, while the country's biggest player, SF Express, is working on a $6.4 billion deal and Yunda Express on a $2.7 billion listing.ZTO plans to use $720 million of the IPO proceeds to purchase land and invest in new facilities to expand its packaged sorting capacity, according to the listing prospectus.The rest will be used to expand its truck fleet, invest in new technology and for potential acquisitions.""It's a competitive industry and you do need fresh capital for your expansion, in particular when all your rivals are doing so or plan to do so,"" said one of the people close to the company.

255,"   By Jeffrey Dastin  FedEx Corp is grounding one of its planes temporarily that has an engine General Electric Co flagged after a passenger jet erupted in flames last month, a spokesman for the cargo airline told Reuters on Monday.Engine-maker GE on Friday alerted airlines about a small number of parts under investigation following American Airlines Flight 383, which caught fire on Oct. 28. The parts were made from the same lot of alloy as a turbine disk used by American, which GE subsequently discovered had a ""material anomaly.""While U.S. investigators have yet to assign blame for the non-fatal incident, they have found what appeared to be fatigue cracking where the disk had an anomaly. Experts have said the disk's corrupted material may indicate a manufacturing defect, either by the parts or metal maker.In a statement, FedEx spokesman Chris Allen said the company was notified that an engine in one MD11 aircraft was affected.  ""The aircraft associated with the affected engine is temporarily not in service until the engine is replaced.  Safety is our top priority,"" he said.GE on Friday said all but one of the parts related to the anomalous disk were out of service. The component on the now-grounded FedEx plane had been the one in operation, GE spokesman Rick Kennedy said on Monday. ""The part has been taken out of service, not because it was viewed as defective but because it was simply from the same lot of material,"" Kennedy said in a statement.The American Airlines flight from Chicago to Miami aborted takeoff following an ""uncontained"" engine failure, a rare event in which components spew from an engine and can tear through an aircraft cabin or rupture fuel tanks in the wings. The airline was flying a Boeing Co 767 aircraft with CF6-80C2 engines made by GE. In this instance, the failure caused a fuel leak that resulted in a fire, though no one aboard was seriously injured.GE has stressed the reliability of its CF6 engines, which it said had flown more than 400 million hours since the 1970s.
