0,"  Eli Lilly and Co (LLY.N) on Tuesday forecast its profit will fall by up to one-third this year, as cheaper generic forms of its Zyprexa schizophrenia treatment and Cymbalta depression drug hurt results, but the outlook was in line with expectations.The U.S. drugmaker said it expects earnings, excluding special items, at $2.77 to $2.85 per share in 2014. Analysts, on average, estimated $2.78 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.The Indianapolis-based company, whose shares were little changed in late-morning trading, forecast revenue this year between $19.2 billion and $19.8 billion, also in line with analysts' expectations.Atlantic Equities analyst Richard Purkiss said 2014 will be the ""trough year"" in Lilly's painful three-year patent cliff, which began in October 2011, when it lost U.S. patent protection for Zyprexa, then its biggest product.Despite lingering skepticism among many investors about Lilly's prospects, Purkiss said he expects company revenue to bounce back strongly in 2015, and for the company to have mid-teens percentage growth in earnings from 2014 to 2017.""The company with the poorest growth over the last couple of years will be right at the top of its large-cap peers globally,"" Purkiss predicted. ""It will be a top-line recovery, driven by good growth from existing products and sales of newly approved medicines.""In the meantime, JP Morgan analyst Chris Schott said Lilly's expected gross profit margin this year - 74 percent - is well below the 79 percent to 80 percent range that Wall Street expected for 2013, and reflects bigger-than-expected declines for Cymbalta. Lilly said the weaker margin will be offset by a $800 million drop in research spending.Zyprexa, which had annual sales of more than $5 billion at its peak, now brings in only $1 billion. Rising prices of Cymbalta have helped cushion Zyprexa's decline, but sales of the $5 billion-a-year antidepressant are expected to plunge following the loss of its own patent protection last month. The company's pain will intensify in March, when Lilly's Evista osteoporosis drug, with annual sales of $1 billion, goes up against generics.Early last year Lilly had projected revenue of $20 billion for 2014, but in October it said it would be hard-pressed to reach that goal because of the devaluation of the yen and slower growth in emerging markets.The drugmaker said on Tuesday it expects to achieve its goals for net income of $3 billion and operating cash flow of $4 billion in 2014, and plans to maintain its dividend at the current level.The company, which reports fourth quarter and 2013 results on January 30, said its 2013 financial expectations also remained unchanged. Lilly's seemingly unending patent cliff has soured many investors and hurt its stock. Company shares rose only 3 percent in 2013, woefully underperforming a 27 percent jump in the ARCA Pharmaceutical Index of large drugmakers .DRG.But other investors have been attracted by the company's generous dividend, with its 3.8 percent yield, and hopes of a rebound for its respected research laboratories.""Investors are largely focused on the company's (drug) pipeline and less on the near term,"" said Edward Jones analyst Judson Clark. He maintained a ""hold"" rating on Lilly, saying its stock appeared to be ""appropriately valued.""Shares dipped 0.2 percent to $51.45 in late-morning trade. One of the company's biggest hopes is an experimental drug called ramucirumab. When used by itself, the drug prolonged survival of patients with stomach cancer in late-stage trials. Some analysts believe annual sales could top $1.5 billion by 2020 if it is approved for the hard-to-treat condition, and for other forms of cancer, including of the lung, liver and colon.U.S. regulators have assigned a priority review to ramucirumab and could decide by the second quarter of 2014 whether to approve it.In a conference call with analysts on Tuesday, Lilly Chief Executive John Lechleiter said diabetes drugs will remain a company mainstay and be an ""entree"" into emerging markets.He said two experimental Lilly diabetes drugs now in late-stage trials, an injectable medicine called dulaglutide and a basal insulin, offer potential advantages over the competition.(Refiled to correct final paragraph to show product is basal insulin, not an insulin glargine similar to Lantus.)(Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)",2014-01-07,LLY,"Tue Jan 7, 2014 | 1:08pm EST",Lilly sees 2014 profit decline in line with estimates,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-lilly-forecast-idUSBREA060FL20140107?type=companyNews

5,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, February 21 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A' rating to Eli  Lilly & Co. Inc.'s (Lilly) $1 billion senior unsecured notes issuance. A full  list of ratings is shown at the end of this release.  Lilly issued $600 million of 1.95% notes due in 2019 and $400 million of 4.65%  notes due in 2044. The net proceeds of the issuance will be used to  repay/refinance existing debt and for general corporate purposes.  The ratings apply to approximately $5.2 billion of debt at Dec. 31, 2013.  Lilly's short-term debt, including the current portion of its long-term debt, is  roughly $1 billion.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Fitch believes Lilly will maintain a credit profile supportive of its 'A' rating  despite facing significant operational headwinds during 2014. Fitch's rating  actions are based on the following: --Lilly faces significant patent risk with three of its top drugs, which account  for roughly 30% of total firm sales and are scheduled to lose patent protection  during the next two years.  --Fitch expects LLY will return to top-line growth during 2015-2016 with the  annualizing of patent expiries and continued strength in established and new  products such as Amyvid, Alimta, Cialis, Effient, Erbitux and  Tradjenta/Jandueto. --Fitch believes Lilly's late-stage pipeline, particularly strong in treatments  for diabetes and cancer, offers the company numerous opportunities to sustain  longer-term growth.  --Fitch anticipates margin compression in 2014 due to Cymbalta's patent expiry.  However Lilly's cost cutting measures should result in a leaner cost structure,  paving the way for margin expansion in 2015-2016 as sales rebound. --Fitch forecasts that Lilly will generate approximately $600 million-$800  million of free cash flow (FCF; cash flow from operations minus capital  expenditures and dividend payments) in 2014. --Relatively aggressive share repurchases from now through 2017 are incorporated  in Fitch's forecast. However, cash dividend increases are expected to be modest  and acquisitions targeted. --With leverage (total debt/EBITDA) of 0.74x for the latest 12-month (LTM)  period ended Dec. 31, 2013, Fitch looks for Lilly to operate with debt leverage  of 1.1x-1.3x during 2014. --Fitch assumes the company will maintain adequate liquidity during the upcoming  patent cliff, supported by FCF generation, balance sheet cash, and availability  on its revolving credit facility. SIGNIFICANT PATENT CLIFF Lilly faces significant patent expiries through 2014. Its largest selling drug,  Cymbalta, lost U.S. patent protection in December 2013 and will lose patent  protection in Europe in August 2014. Cymbalta accounts for roughly 24% of total  company sales. Evista loses U.S. market exclusivity in March 2014 and accounts  for approximately 4% of total firm revenues.  REBOUND WITH PATENT-PROTECTED PRODUCTS Fitch expects Lilly will return to top-line growth during 2015-2016, achieving  annual sales in excess of $20 billion. The negative effect of near-term patent  expiries on revenues will have effectively annualized in early 2015. Currently  marketed drugs including Amyvid (Alzheimer's diagnosis), Alimta (cancer), Cialis  (erectile dysfunction), Effient (cardiac thrombosis), Erbitux (cancer) and  Tradjenta/Jandueto (diabetes), in aggregate, have decent intermediate-term  growth potential. These drugs, combined, generate roughly $5.2 billion in annual  revenues for Lilly and address large and growing treatment markets. IMPROVING PIPELINE Lilly has improved its growth prospects for the intermediate- to longer-term, as  it has been making significant progress in building its late-stage pipeline.   The company currently has four drug candidates in registration to treat diabetes  and gastric cancer (and possibly lung cancer). In phase III development, Lilly  has a growing number of therapeutics, including three to treat cancer and two to  treat diabetes. In addition, its phase III pipeline contains drugs to treat  lupus, psoriasis, high cholesterol, depression, and rheumatoid arthritis. The  company has partnered with Boehringer Ingelheim in its efforts to develop  diabetes medications.  EFFORTS TO SUPPORT MARGINS Fitch expects Lilly to remain focused on controlling costs in order to support  margins while balancing its need to invest in growth. The company faces a number  of operational headwinds, including the anticipated near-term patent expiries.  As such, Lilly has cumulatively taken approximately $391 million out of SG&A  during the last 12 months (ended Dec. 31, 2013). During the same period, the  company has remained steadfast in funding longer term growth by increasing  research and development spending by roughly $310 million. Nevertheless, Fitch  anticipates materially compressed EBITDA margins (24%-25%) during 2014 and  improvement thereafter. POSITIVE BUT SUBDUED FCF Fitch forecasts positive but lower FCF of approximately $900 million during  2014, as Lilly contends with the loss of profitable U.S. sales of Cymbalta and  Evista. Expected cash flow from operations of roughly $4.1 billion should be  sufficient to fund $2.2 billion in cash dividends and $1.3 billion in capital  expenditures. Fitch believes FCF will grow from 2014 levels over the long run,  as revenues and margins recover. RELATIVELY AGGRESSIVE CASH DEPLOYMENT Fitch incorporates roughly $5 billion in share repurchases from now through  2017-2018, funded with FCF and cash on hand.  However, Fitch models only  incremental dividend increases and targeted acquisitions during the same  forecast period, which will not likely stress Lilly's balance sheet. LEVERAGE TO INCREASE IN 2014 Fitch looks for Lilly to operate with debt leverage of 1.1x-1.3x in 2014 during  the height of the patent expiries. This is a sharp increase from current  leverage of 0.74x. Fitch recognizes that there is some uncertainty surrounding  its forecasted leverage range for 2014, since the forecast will be influenced by  the level of profitability the company will generate during the period, as well  as the discipline Lilly exercises regarding balance sheet debt. Fitch assumes  Lilly will refinance the $1 billion senior unsecured notes maturing in March  2014. ADEQUATE LIQUIDITY Fitch assumes Lilly will maintain adequate liquidity, supported by FCF  generation, balance sheet cash and availability on its revolving credit  facility. At Dec. 31, 2013, the company had approximately $5.4 billion of cash  and short-term investments, full availability on its $1.2 billion credit  facility which matures April 7, 2015, and roughly $7.6 billion in noncurrent  investments. Lilly generated approximately $2.5 billion in FCF during the LTM  period. At Dec. 31, 2013, Lilly had approximately $5.2 billion in debt outstanding.  Fitch believes the company's debt maturities are manageable with roughly $1  billion maturing in 2014, $200 million in 2016, and $1 billion in 2017. Fitch's  forecast assumes that Lilly will refinance these maturities with new debt  issuances, as evidenced by its recent notes issuance. RATING SENSITIVITIES Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a revision  of the Rating Outlook to Positive include: --Revenues continue to expand for recently launched patent protected products,  including Amyvid, Alimta, Cialis, Effient, Erbitux and Tradjenta/Jandueto; --The company employs adequate cost controls to generate sufficient  profitability while limiting increases in debt to maintain leverage sustainably  below 1.3x; --Cash is deployed conservatively, with the majority of the planned $5 billion  share repurchase program funded through cash flow as opposed to debt issuance.   Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a Negative  Rating Outlook and/or a one-notch downgrade to 'A-'/'F2' include: --Operational stress from, but not limited to, patent expiries drives leverage  durably above 1.7x; --FCF deteriorates without the expectation of a timely trend reversal. Fitch currently rates Eli Lilly as follows: --Long-term IDR at 'A';  --Senior unsecured debt rating at 'A'; --Bank loan rating at 'A'; --Short-term IDR at 'F1'; --Commercial paper rating at'F1'.  The Rating Outlook is Stable.

7,"   By Bill Berkrot  An experimental once-weekly medicine for type 2 diabetes developed by Eli Lilly and Co proved as effective in lowering blood sugar as Victoza from Danish drugmaker Novo Nordisk in an eagerly anticipated late stage study.The Lilly drug, dulaglutide, achieved the primary goal of the 599-patient study by demonstrating so-called non-inferiority to the highest approved dose of Victoza after 26 weeks, according to initial results released by the company on Tuesday. Lilly shares rose more than 1 percent before retreating.Dulaglutide, considered one of the more important medicines in Lilly's pipeline of drugs in development, is awaiting U.S. and European approval decisions.""It is our hope that we will have approval this year,"" Lilly's Senior Medical Director Sherry Martin said in a telephone interview.Once weekly dulaglutide and Victoza, which is taken daily and known chemically as liraglutide, belong to a class of injected diabetes drugs called GLP-1 receptor agonists. They work by increasing the release of insulin after meals and by slowing absorption of food in the gastrointestinal tract.""Dulaglutide is the only GLP-1 agonist to show non-inferiority against liraglutide's highest-approved dose in a Phase III trial,"" Enrique Conterno, president of Lilly Diabetes, said in a statement.BMO Capital Markets analyst Alex Arfaei noted that the other weekly diabetes drug from the class did not fare as well in a similar study. ""The positive surprise here is that so far dulaglutide had shown a similar clinical profile to competitor Bydureon in terms of A1C (blood glucose) lowering and Bydureon failed to show non-inferiority versus Victoza,"" he said, referring to AstraZeneca's weekly diabetes treatment from the same class.John Boris, an analyst with Suntrust Robinson Humphrey, raised his sales forecast for dulaglutide to $1.6 billion by 2020 from $1.1 billion following the non-inferiority result.He believes Lilly will be able to undercut Novo's Victoza pricing with payors since the study used a lower dose - 1.5 milligrams versus 1.8mg for Victoza - and that the weekly dosing will give it an additional competitive advantage.""Those are two powerful tools,"" said Boris, who sees the GLP-1 market growing to $5 billion by 2020. Victoza, which now owns about 70 percent of the market for GLP-1 drugs, had sales of more than $590 million in the fourth quarter, putting it on track to exceed $2 billion this year.Dulaglutide in previous studies proved superior in reducing blood sugar compared with placebo and a variety of other diabetes treatments. But analysts had been especially anxious to see how it would fare against future main rival Victoza.DETAILS LATER THIS YEAR Patients in the Award-6 trial were already taking metformin, the most commonly prescribed initial treatment for type 2 diabetes.

14,"  * Louisiana jury orders $6 bln damages from Takeda, $3 bln from Eli Lilly* Award unlikely to stand after Takeda and Eli Lilly challenges* Takeda shares mark biggest one-day loss in five years   (Adds legal expert commentary, background)By Daniel Levine and Edmund KlamannSAN FRANCISCO/TOKYO, April 8 Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd said it would contest $6 billion in punitive damages imposed by a jury in the United States in a case that accused Japan's largest drugmaker of concealing cancer risks associated with its Actos diabetes drug.Eli Lilly and Co, Takeda's co-defendant in the case, was ordered to pay $3 billion in punitive damages by the jury in Louisiana on Monday. It also awarded $1.475 million in compensatory damages.Legal experts said it was unlikely that such a large award would stand after challenges in court by both companies. Eli Lilly and Takeda have said they would dispute the verdict, which could include appeals to a higher court or filing motions asking the trial judge to set aside or reduce the verdict.""Although there's no mathematical bright line"" to determine how high is too high when it comes to punitive damage awards, federal appeals courts generally scrutinize the ratio of punitive to compensatory damages, preferring those that fall into the single-digit range, according to Professor Catherine Sharkey, a tort law expert at New York University School of Law.Punitive damages are meant to discourage companies from bad conduct. Compensatory damages are meant to pay victims for their actual losses. With a ratio of more than 6,100 to 1 of punitive to compensatory damages, the Actos award could be highly vulnerable.""It's definitely the case that the U.S. Supreme Court has signaled to lower courts that they should be restraining very large punitive awards,"" Sharkey added. Lilly, which co-promoted Actos from 1999 to 2006, said in a press release it will be indemnified by Takeda for its losses and expenses around the litigation based on the terms of its agreement with Takeda.Takeda's shares fell as much as 8.8 percent to an eight-month low in Tokyo trading on Tuesday after the verdict. The stock ended 5.2 percent lower at 4,572 yen.Lilly shares fell 0.2 percent, or 12 cents per share, to $58.50 per share in New York Stock Exchange trading. The massive award was met with ""stunned silence"" in the  Lafayette, Louisiana, courtroom, plaintiffs' lawyer Mark Lanier said.Lanier acknowledged it was not certain whether the damages award would be sustained.""Nobody has gone out and bought a new home,"" Lanier said. ""This is a conservative judge and a conservative court and she's very 'balls and strikes.' We're not under any grand illusion.""The $9 billion in punitive damages awarded by the jury against Takeda and Eli Lilly exceed the $5 billion penalty that a jury in Alaska imposed on Exxon Mobil Corp for the Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989.The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2008 that the previous Exxon Valdez award had been ""excessive."" The company was ultimately ordered to pay $500 million. That and other rulings have been read as limiting punitive damages in federal cases.Lanier said the jury deliberated for only an hour and 10 minutes to deliver its verdict finding liability on all 14 questions, and 45 minutes longer to come out with the multibillion-dollar punitive damages.The allocation of liability for compensatory damages was  75 percent for Takeda and 25 percent for Lilly, according to Lilly.Takeda said judgements were entered in Takeda's favor in all three previous Actos trials, while this was the first federal case to be tried in a consolidated multidistrict litigation comprising more than 2,900 lawsuits.Last May, a U.S. judge had nullified a separate jury verdict for $6.5 million against Takeda after ruling that the plaintiffs failed to offer any reliable evidence that Actos had caused cancer.Germany and France suspended use of the drug, a multibillion-dollar seller, in 2011 because of concerns about a possible link to cancer.The case is In Re: Actos Products Liability Litigation Case U.S. District Court, Western District Louisiana, No. 6:11-md-2299.

20,"   By Caroline Copley and Paul Sandle | ZURICH/LONDON  ZURICH/LONDON Novartis and GlaxoSmithKline agreed to trade more than $20 billion worth of assets on Tuesday to bolster their best businesses and exit weaker ones as the drug industry contends with healthcare spending cuts and generic competition.The deals, which include Novartis' purchase of GSK's cancer drugs and GSK's acquisition of Novartis' vaccines business, came just after a newspaper report that AstraZeneca Plc had turned down a $101 billion bid approach from Pfizer Inc, a story that sent shares up across the sector.In addition, Novartis is selling its animal health arm to Indianapolis-based Eli Lilly for about $5.4 billion in cash. That would make Lilly's Elanco unit the world's second-largest animal health business when that deal closes early next year.A flurry of dealmaking has overtaken the global pharmaceutical industry recently as most large companies try to focus on a small number of leading businesses, while smaller specialty and generic producers seek greater scale.Deal values have almost doubled since the start of 2014 to $77.9 billion from a year earlier, according to Thomson Reuters data.The overhaul at Novartis marks the end of a yearlong review of its sprawling portfolio after the departure of longtime Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Daniel Vasella, the architect of the merger of Ciba-Geigy and Sandoz that led to the company's formation in 1996.The Swiss drugmaker said it would buy London-based GSK's oncology products for $14.5 billion plus another $1.5 billion that depends on the results of a trial in melanoma.The deal will strengthen Novartis's world No. 2 position in cancer behind crosstown rival Roche Holding AG.Novartis said GSK was buying its vaccines, excluding flu, for $5.25 billion plus potential milestone payments of up to $1.8 billion and ongoing royalties. The companies also will form a joint venture in consumer healthcare.The transactions, and their hint of more deals ahead for the drug sector, lifted the ARCA Pharmaceutials Index 1.8 percent.Lilly's Elanco animal health unit will acquire about 600 animal health brands from Novartis, including vaccines and anti-parasite medicines that will allow it to enter the acquaculture, or fish farming, market.

24,"  (Adds background on Merck auction)By Arno Schuetze and Olivia OranFRANKFURT/NEW YORK, April 29 Bayer AG  is offering to swap its animal health assets for Merck & Co Inc's consumer healthcare business, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday, in a move that could give the German drugmaker a leg up in the $14 billion auction of the Merck business.As part of its bid, Bayer has offered to pay the remainder of the acquisition price in cash, these people said, who asked not to be named because the matter is not public.Bayer and Britain's Reckitt Benckiser Group are among the final contenders for the Merck unit, best known for Coppertone sunscreen and Claritin allergy medicine, Reuters reported last weekend. Bayer's animal health business had net sales of 1.3 billion euros ($1.8 billion) in 2013, according to the company's website. Representatives for Bayer declined to comment and Merck did not respond to requests for comment.Bayer's asset swap offer is yet another evidence of drugmakers' efforts to exit weaker businesses and focus resources on areas of strength. Last week, Novartis and GlaxoSmithKline Plc agreed to trade more than $20 billion worth of assets, with Eli Lilly and Co buying Novartis' animal health business for $5.4 billion.However, asset swaps are often complicated and hard to value and there is no guarantee Bayer's offer will prevail over cash offers from rival suitors, people familiar with the matter said. Merck's auction has also drawn interest from several other healthcare and consumer giants including Boehringer Ingelheim, Sanofi SA, Procter & Gamble Co and Novartis AG , Reuters previously reported.A sale of Merck's consumer business could approach $14 billion with an outcome expected this week, sources said last week.Reckitt confirmed on Monday it was in talks to buy the Merck unit. Bayer's Chief Executive Marijn Dekkers said on Monday during a conference call with analysts that OTC ""is an important business for us.""Reckitt owns over-the-counter medicines, including Mucinex and Nurofen and the international rights for the Scholl foot care business. Germany's Bayer has a strong portfolio of consumer products, including pain medication Aleve and antacid Alka-Seltzer.

25,"   By Adam Jourdan and John Ruwitch | SHANGHAI  SHANGHAI May 18 Chinese corruption charges against executives of British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK) could be just the start of the pharmaceutical industry's problems in its biggest emerging drugs market, according to industry sources in China.The charges relating to GSK executives, accused of funnelling hundreds of millions of dollars in bribes to doctors and health officials via travel agencies, were announced by Chinese authorities last week, the culmination of a 10-month police investigation.But the GSK case is unlikely to represent closure for the drugs industry in China, which is set to become the world's second-biggest pharmaceutical market behind the United States within three years according to consultancy IMS Health.Drug-company executives, sales staff, lawyers and compliance experts say China's crackdown on drugmakers and other healthcare firms is intensifying as prosecutors grow bolder in the wake of the GSK case, threatening to stymie the growth of any firms caught in the crosshairs of the prolonged corruption crackdown.""The investigation against GSK may be coming to a close, but these types of probes in the pharmaceutical sector are becoming a weekly occurrence,"" a sales rep for the Chinese unit of a major global drugmaker said. He requested his name and his firm's name be withheld due to the sensitivity of the topic.After a series of probes against foreign drugmakers last year, a range of government bodies, including the state planning agency, local commerce bureaus and the health ministry are making frequent, sometimes unannounced spot-checks at foreign healthcare firms, risk consultants and lawyers said.Lawyers estimate that more than half of all drugmakers operating in China are being investigated in some capacity, from large multinational firms to Chinese state-owned enterprises.The impact of an investigation can be significant.GSK's revenues in the country plunged 61 percent in the third quarter last year and were still down by 20 percent in the first quarter of 2014 from a year earlier. Official Chinese media said on Friday that the firm might have suffered ""irreparable damage"" in the Chinese market.Legal sources and one source with direct knowledge of the GSK investigation said China's authorities might still try to charge the company itself, which could potentially put GSK's business licences to operate in China at risk.GSK said in a statement on Wednesday that the firm wanted ""to reach a resolution that will enable the company to continue to make an important contribution to the health and welfare of China and its citizens"".A London-based spokesman declined to elaborate on Friday. KNOCKING ON DOORS Chinese authorities, led by the State Administration for Industry and Commerce (SAIC) and the country's public security bureau (PSB), are ramping up their visits to foreign drug firms.""We have certainly been made aware from clients that inspection visits by various government agencies have increased and these visits are now more focused,"" said risk consultant Bob Youill, Shanghai-based managing director at FTI Consulting.Authorities are looking to unearth proof that firms have violated anti-corruption laws or artificially inflated drug prices, a sensitive theme as China's leaders look to provide affordable healthcare to the country's near-1.4 billion people.Last year authorities visited large international drugs manufacturers including Novartis AG, AstraZeneca Plc , Sanofi SA, Eli Lilly & Co and Bayer AG as part of a broad investigation into the sector.Bayer said its contacts with regulators were within the normal range. Johnson & Johnson spokesman Ernie Knewitz said he was unaware of any ""new developments"" in China. Chinese subsidiaries of U.S. drugmaker Merck & Co Inc  ""have received and may continue to receive inquiries regarding their operations from various Chinese governmental agencies"", Merck spokesman Steven Cragle said via email.Pfizer Inc said that it regularly interacted with government and regulatory agencies in China ""to discuss a variety of issues, including patient access, regulatory and compliance matters, and anti-counterfeiting measures"".Roche Holding AG said it had not been contacted or investigated by Chinese authorities over allegations of corruption, while a Novartis spokeswoman said she was not aware of any contact from authorities in China around corruption.AstraZeneca, Sanofi and Eli Lilly did not have any immediate comment.Lawyers and consultants say a case as severe as GSK is unlikely to be repeated anytime soon, but that the charges against the British firm are likely to open the floodgates to a number of smaller corruption probes throughout the sector.Chinese police charged GSK's former China boss, Briton Mark Reilly, and two other colleagues with corruption on Wednesday after the probe found the firm had made billions of yuan from bribing doctors and hospitals. ""Just this morning we are starting with three new compliance investigation cases,"" John Huang, Shanghai-based partner at law firm MWE China, told Reuters last week. China's PSB and SAIC were actively visiting drug firms, he said.""We're being asked to do training on how to deal with dawn raids, how to act when people are being arrested, and how individuals should respond to police investigations.""COMPLIANCE BOOST In turn, companies are looking to boost internal compliance systems and training, company insiders and lawyers said.""My company's compliance systems have always been strict, but recently there have been more detailed regulations, with more all-encompassing rules and lots of internal probes,"" said a second China-based sales rep at a large U.S. drugmaker.This has been a boon for compliance lawyers and risk consultants, said Nat Edmonds, a partner at law firm Paul Hastings and a former Foreign Corrupt Practices Act litigator at the U.S. Justice Department.""The amount of resources companies are putting into this has increased exponentially,"" Edmonds told Reuters in Shanghai.The issue for drugmakers - both Chinese and foreign - is that China's healthcare system is widely accepted to be riddled with bribery and corruption. Graft is often used to smooth business ties between sales reps and doctors.Without these illicit payments many companies would struggle to compete, lawyers and company insiders said.This would pose a challenge for firms as they look to hit steep sales targets under the glare of Chinese watchdogs.""The whole industry is going to get more and more regulated,"" said a source with direct knowledge of the GSK investigation.

26,"   By Adam Jourdan | SHANGHAI  SHANGHAI A crackdown on corruption and pricing in China's fast-growing pharmaceutical market has squeezed profits and margins, raising a red flag to global Big Pharma that the days of easy growth in the country may be over.A Reuters' analysis of more than 60 listed Chinese healthcare firms shows average profit margins declined to around 10 percent last year from 15 percent in 2012. Average net profits fell 2.1 percent, down from close to 20 percent growth in previous years.China has been a magnet for the big global pharmaceutical companies and other healthcare firms as growth slows in Europe and the United States. It is the largest emerging drugs market and is set to be the global number two overall within three years, according to consultancy IMS Health.While global drugmakers withhold their China profit figures, the analysis suggests profit growth is harder to come by - a concern as many global firms look to China as a future growth driver.""Most companies, local and foreign, have enjoyed an easy growth phase for 5-6 years as money was thrown at the healthcare system to improve access,"" said Alexander Ng, Hong Kong-based associate principal at McKinsey & Co. ""Now China is more into cost containment mode... and the squeeze on pricing and margins is a lot more apparent.""Over the past year, China has cracked down on high prices and corruption in the healthcare sector. Authorities probed drugmakers over pricing in July, while a high-profile investigation into British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline Plc led to executives at the company being charged with bribery earlier this month.Industry and legal sources said the investigations into the sector are likely to grow more intense, meaning downward pressure on profits is likely to remain.Graphic: Reuters survey r.reuters.com/nuw59vSALES DRAG The climate of investigation has stymied sales growth, with some doctors saying they are worried to meet pharmaceutical reps, fearing being caught in the glare of China's watchdogs.

The pattern of selling through bribing definitely won't work anymore,"" said a Shanghai-based sales executive at another global drugmaker, speaking on condition of anonymity.The Reuters' analysis showed combined revenue growth in the sector fell to 17.9 percent last year, from 22.6 percent in 2012 and more than 28.8 percent in 2011.PRICING PRESSURE  Price cuts are also putting a strain on profits and margins as China's leaders look to cut a healthcare bill that is set to hit $1 trillion by 2020, according to McKinsey & Co. Combined profit growth dropped to around 5.2 percent last year from 23.9 percent in 2011, according to the Reuters' analysis.While authorities have made some moves to step back on price caps, Chinese healthcare procurement still puts the main emphasis on cost, creating an incentive for firms to push prices lower to beat rivals to contracts.""The industry is in a very competitive stage, where firms want to take market share to stay in the game, but at the same time can't deal with the low prices,"" said Yu Mingde, president of the Chinese Pharmaceutical Enterprises Association, an organization supervised by China's cabinet.The crackdown on pricing has pushed some Chinese firms out of business and forced global drugmakers to rethink their China strategy, industry sources and analysts said, putting greater emphasis on high-tech drugs which command greater pricing power.International drugmakers have long banked on being able to charge a steep premium in emerging markets for branded generic drugs that have gone off patent in their home market. Generics specialist Actavis Plc pulled out of China this year, saying the market was too risky and not a business-friendly environment.""When you have 5,000 competitors you have to be special, and being a foreign company is no longer enough,"" said Guillaume Demarne, Shanghai-based business development manager at healthcare research body Institut Pasteur.M&A DRIVER Rising competition in the market will also likely spur a round of consolidation as firms look to strengthen in terms of scale or technology to stay ahead of rivals, analysts said.Bayer said in February it would buy Chinese traditional medicine maker Dihon Pharmaceutical, while Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical Group Co Ltd said last month it plans to take U.S.-listed Chindex International Inc private in a $461 million deal with equity firm TPG.""The level of industrial concentration will rapidly increase by way of acquisitions and reorganizations,"" Fosun Pharmaceutical said in a statement with its annual earnings.M&A activity this year has so far outstripped 2013, said Phil Leung, China healthcare head and Asia Pacific M&A head for consultancy Bain & Co, noting that local and global firms were looking at acquisitions, joint ventures and other tie-ups.Drugmakers with advantages of scale, low-cost production or unique, in-demand products should hold their own, he said, while others would struggle to survive.""In this environment, the strong will get stronger and the stragglers will be more exposed.""(Additional reporting by Li Hui in BEIJING and SHANGHAI newsroom; Editing by Ian Geoghegan)",2014-05-25,LLY,"Sat May 24, 2014 | 10:16pm EDT",A bitter pill as China crackdowns squeeze pharma margins,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-china-pharmaceuticals-margins-idUSBREA4O00W20140525?type=companyNews

28,"   By Adam Jourdan | SHANGHAI  SHANGHAI May 25 A crackdown on corruption and pricing in China's fast-growing pharmaceutical market has squeezed profits and margins, raising a red flag to global Big Pharma that the days of easy growth in the country may be over.A Reuters' analysis of more than 60 listed Chinese healthcare firms shows average profit margins declined to around 10 percent last year from 15 percent in 2012. Average net profits fell 2.1 percent, down from close to 20 percent growth in previous years.China has been a magnet for the big global pharmaceutical companies and other healthcare firms as growth slows in Europe and the United States. It is the largest emerging drugs market and is set to be the global number two overall within three years, according to consultancy IMS Health.While global drugmakers withhold their China profit figures, the analysis suggests profit growth is harder to come by - a concern as many global firms look to China as a future growth driver.""Most companies, local and foreign, have enjoyed an easy growth phase for 5-6 years as money was thrown at the healthcare system to improve access,"" said Alexander Ng, Hong Kong-based associate principal at McKinsey & Co. ""Now China is more into cost containment mode... and the squeeze on pricing and margins is a lot more apparent.""Over the past year, China has cracked down on high prices and corruption in the healthcare sector. Authorities probed drugmakers over pricing in July, while a high-profile investigation into British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline Plc  led to executives at the company being charged with bribery earlier this month.Industry and legal sources said the investigations into the sector are likely to grow more intense, meaning downward pressure on profits is likely to remain.SALES DRAG  The climate of investigation has stymied sales growth, with some doctors saying they are worried to meet pharmaceutical reps, fearing being caught in the glare of China's watchdogs.In 2013, Chinese authorities visited global drugmakers including Novartis AG, AstraZeneca Plc, Sanofi SA, Eli Lilly & Co and Bayer AG as part of a broad investigation into the sector.GSK, which saw its China revenues plunge 61 percent in the third quarter last year, has since overhauled its management structure in China, stopped payments to healthcare professionals and changed its incentive systems for drug reps.""Of course there will be an impact on sales. The pattern of selling through bribing definitely won't work anymore,"" said a Shanghai-based sales executive at another global drugmaker, speaking on condition of anonymity.The Reuters' analysis showed combined revenue growth in the sector fell to 17.9 percent last year, from 22.6 percent in 2012 and more than 28.8 percent in 2011.

31,"  * Charges against GSK's Mark Reilly shocked business community* Managers weigh legal responsibility of taking top positions* Crackdown is part of wider campaign against corruptionBy Adam JourdanSHANGHAI, June 13 China's crackdown on corruption in the pharmaceutical sector has frightened foreign executives so much that some fear they could be jailed and have asked their lawyers if they should leave the country for six months. Others are thinking of going for good.While the crackdown has been building for a year, Chinese police shocked the foreign business community a month ago when they filed corruption charges against Mark Reilly, former China head of British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline Plc. The Briton, who has been barred from leaving China, could face decades in prison.Even before then, executives were getting worried about a wave of visits from police and regulators to their offices as well as articles in Chinese media alleging corrupt practices against many global drugmakers.The charges against Reilly had prompted some senior executives to look at all contingencies, several legal and industry sources said.""Many of our clients are asking about personal liabilities and insurance, with executives asking if they are put in jail what will happen to their families and how the company will provide protection for them,"" said John Huang, Shanghai-based co-founder and managing partner at law firm MWE China.Police said a year-long investigation found GSK made billions of yuan from schemes to bribe doctors and hospitals. Two senior Chinese executives were also charged.Britain's biggest drugmaker has said the accusations were ""deeply concerning"" and that it had zero tolerance for bribery. Reilly has not been reachable for comment while his lawyer has declined to talk to the media. Reilly's whereabouts are unknown. LOOKING FOR THE EXIT Global drugmakers contacted by Reuters declined to comment about the crackdown and how it was affecting executive morale in the world's third-largest pharmaceutical market.But Huang and two pharmaceutical executives said some managers were reconsidering the legal risks involved in holding any position where they were responsible for some of the thousands of marketing and sales staff that global firms employ across China.Investigators have focused on those staff and how they deal with poorly paid doctors and administrators in public hospitals, the biggest buyers of medicine in China.The crackdown, which shows no sign of abating, coincides with a wider campaign by President Xi Jinping against corporate and official graft.Lawyers said some executives and in-house counsel had sought legal advice about leaving China to avoid getting caught up in any future probes. Some top managers were actively pursuing career options outside China, said one source. Others were contemplating a more temporary escape until the worst blew over.""They are thinking about leaving China short-term, staying out of the country on a three or six-month rotation,"" said another Shanghai-based lawyer, who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the subject.By moving abroad, executives would avoid being arrested should there be any formal investigation into their firms, lawyers said. Executives had sought advice on relocating to Singapore, Hong Kong and other destinations, they added.Some international firms were also finding it harder to attract staff to China, said the two pharmaceutical executives at separate global drugmakers, who declined to be identified because they were not authorised to speak to the media.Other executives believe the GSK case is a one-off event and are more focused on not falling foul of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which can apply to a wide variety of firms that have business ties to the United States. That would be a mistake, said Steven Dickinson, partner at law firm Harris Moure in the Chinese port city of Qingdao.""Every week I write an email saying you're missing the point - you won't have time to get hit by the U.S. law because you'll be in jail in China,"" Dickinson said.WIDER SCRUTINY While formal charges have only been levelled against GSK executives, virtually all big drugmakers in China have come under scrutiny from police or regulators.Last year authorities visited Novartis AG of Switzerland, Britain's AstraZeneca Plc, Sanofi SA  of France, U.S. firm Eli Lilly & Co, Germany's Bayer AG and Danish drugmaker Novo Nordisk A/S .All said they were cooperating with the authorities and that they did not condone bribery.Most recently, Swiss drugmaker Roche Holding AG  said last month its Hangzhou office in eastern China was visited by China's anti-graft watchdog, the State Administration for Industry & Commerce (SAIC). The regulator declined to give details while Roche said it would cooperate with the authorities.A leaked memo from the Health Ministry in Hangzhou also named Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk and AstraZeneca as examples of drugmakers suspected of making kickbacks. The three firms said they had not been contacted by authorities over the matter.Several global drugmakers including Novo Nordisk, Eli Lilly and Roche have also changed their China heads in the past year. The three firms said the moves had nothing to do with the crackdown.GSK replaced Reilly in July after the investigation into the company was announced. Johnson & Johnson appointed a China chairman in a newly created role in August to oversee the firm's business. The U.S. company declined to comment on the move.

32,"   By Ransdell Pierson  Eli Lilly and Co's (LLY.N) quarterly revenue plunged due to generic competition for its Cymbalta depression drug and its Evista osteoporosis treatment, but cost controls helped earnings beat forecasts.Lilly on Thursday said it had earned 68 cents per share in the second quarter, above analysts' average forecast of 65 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Sales of Cymbalta, which lost U.S. patent protection in December, tumbled 73 percent to $401 million. Evista, which began facing cheaper generics in March, had a sales drop of 61 percent to $108 million.    The Indianapolis drugmaker's sales and earnings have been badly hurt since late 2011, when its top-selling Zyprexa schizophrenia drug lost U.S. patent protection and faced competition from cheaper generics.The expiration of patents and resulting decline in revenue have been a problem for most U.S. drugmakers and are among the reasons for a surge in mergers and acquisitions in the sector.But rather than attempt to merge with another big drugmaker, Lilly has vowed to remain independent and rely on its own product lineup to get back on track.    Lilly on Thursday said it plans to stick with that strategy and selectively make small or mid-size acquisitions. By contrast, Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), which faces looming patent expirations on big drugs, earlier this year tried but failed to buy British rival AstraZeneca Plc (AZN.L) in a deal valued at $118 billion.Pfizer hoped to slash its tax rate by buying AstraZeneca and domiciling the combined company in Britain, a maneuver known as a tax inversion. Other healthcare companies are pursuing similar deals.Pfizer, with three mega-mergers since 2000, has focused on U.S. rivals, largely for huge cost cuts that boosted earnings.Lilly Chief Executive John Lechleiter, appearing on CNBC on Thursday, said Lilly had not been approached by Pfizer and did not ""intend to be anyone's target.""      Later, in a conference call with investors, Lechleiter said tax reform is needed in the United States to create a lower corporate tax rate, so U.S. companies can better compete with overseas rivals.""It's time for Congress to step up to the plate to get this thing done,"" he said during the call.Company Chief Financial Officer Derica Rice said Lilly would never pursue tax inversions as a ""primary driver"" of deals, although they could be a secondary benefit.  Lilly earned $734 million, or 68 cents per share, in the second quarter. That compared with $1.21 billion, or $1.11 per share, a year earlier, when the company took charges for closing a distribution center and other costs.Although revenue fell 17 percent to $4.94 billion, it topped Wall Street expectations of $4.90 billion.Lilly said it still expects earnings this year of $2.72 to $2.80 per share, excluding special items.Shares of Lilly edged 0.6 percent higher to $64.62 in midday trading.

35,"  Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd and Eli Lilly & Co lost a bid to overturn a combined $9 billion punitive damage award by a U.S. jury for hiding cancer risks associated with their Actos diabetes drug, according to a court ruling.""Plaintiffs have pointed to sufficient evidence from which the jury could have concluded that the 'information' about bladder cancer contained in Actos labels did not adequately warn of the increased risk of cancer,"" U.S. District Judge Rebecca Doherty of the Western District of Louisiana said on Wednesday.The development is a setback for Takeda but leaves open the possibility of a retrial or reduced verdict, for which Japan's top drugmaker made a separate appeal in April.A spokeswoman called the latest ruling ""unfortunate"", adding that Takeda continued to hope for an outcome in its favor on the separate appeal. Takeda reiterated its intention to keep fighting in court rather than settle.Legal experts have said it was unlikely that such a large award would stand after challenges in court by both companies. Lilly, which co-promoted Actos from 1999 to 2006, was not immediately available to comment. The company has previously said it will be indemnified by Takeda for its losses and expenses from the litigation based on the terms of its agreement with Takeda.Shares in Takeda reacted little to the news, rising 0.4 percent on Friday afternoon, against a slight fall in the broader Tokyo market. Actos, an oral Type 2 diabetes medication that regulates blood sugar levels, has been on the market since 1999.Takeda on Friday separately announced findings of a 10-year epidemiology study that concluded that there was no evidence to suggest that taking Actos led to an increased risk of bladder cancer. Data from the study, conducted by the University of Pennsylvania and Kaiser Permanente Northern California, was submitted to regulatory authorities in the United States, Europe and Japan, it said.This is the first federal case to be tried in consolidated multidistrict litigation comprising more than 2,900 lawsuits. In all three previous Actos trials, Takeda has said, judgments were entered in its favor.

44,"  Eli Lilly and Co said it would stop the development of its drug to treat the autoimmune disorder lupus, after it was found to be not effective enough in late-stage trials.While Lilly's shares hardly budged on the news, the ADRs of Israel-based XTL Biopharmaceuticals Inc, which is developing its own lupus treatment, were up 87 percent at $3.09 in early afternoon trading.Lupus is a condition in which the body's immune system starts attacking healthy tissues, causing inflammation, pain and, in extreme cases, death.About 1.5 million people in the United States are estimated to suffer from lupus, according to the U.S. Centers of Disease Control and Prevention.The disease has been particularly challenging for drugmakers.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved GlaxoSmithKline's Benlysta in March 2011, making it the first lupus drug to be approved in 50 years. Lilly tested the drug, tabalumab, in two studies, but it failed to meet the primary goal in one of the trials.""Collectively, the data from these studies did not meet expectations for efficacy in the context of existing treatments,"" the company said, adding that the decision to stop developing the drug had nothing to do with safety concerns.The decision to drop tabalumab will result in a charge of about 4-5 cents per share in the third quarter, Lilly said. The Lupus Foundation of America said there was enough evidence in Lilly's data to merit further examination.""The results underscore that the pathway this drug targets (B cells) is known to be critical in the development of lupus,"" the non-profit organization said in a statement.B cells are white blood cells that produce antibodies to fight off infections. They are an important component of abnormal immune responses that can be used to identify each autoimmune disease. XTL said last month that it would start mid-stage studies of its lupus drug in mid 2015 and planned to meet FDA officials at the end of this year to discuss trial design.Shares of Anthera Pharmaceuticals Inc, which has completed mid-stage studies of its potential lupus treatment, were down 6.7 percent at $1.68 on the Nasdaq.Lilly shares were down almost 1 percent at $64.50 on the New York Stock Exchange.

50,"   By Frank Siebelt and Ludwig Burger | BAD VILBEL Germany  BAD VILBEL Germany Germany's Stada plans to bring a copy of Eli Lilly's Forteo osteoporosis treatment to market, its chief executive said, as the generic drugmaker moves further into the sale of cheaper alternatives for costly biotech drugs.Hartmut Retzlaff told Reuters in an interview on Friday that its partner - biotech development firm Richter-Helm - would develop a copy of synthetic hormone Forteo. Stada has secured the license to market it in Europe.""We are preparing for a market launch in 2019,"" said Retzlaff, who has been at the helm for 21 years.He added the company was in talks over another copycat biotech drug, or ""biosimilar"", that could be introduced in 2017, but declined to name it because a deal had not been struck.Hundreds of companies around the world are chasing the emerging biosimilars market, with more than 700 substances now in development or already approved, a major study of the sector showed last month.Many top-selling biotech medicines - made from proteins and other large molecules - are losing patent protection. But copycat versions of biological medicines can be difficult, since such drugs are produced in living cells and imitations can only be similar, not identical. After suffering cost overruns in developing its own biosimilar version of anemia treatment erythropoietin (EPO), Stada decided in 2011 to focus on the marketing side of the business and at the time won Hungarian drugmaker Richter as a partner for the development of two drugs.So far, such copycat medicines have typically been offered at a 20 to 30 percent discount to innovator brands, but Retzlaff warned he expected the average discount to rise to 50 percent three years after market launch, as more rivals pile in. PARADIGM SHIFT Still, the business promised better margins than the company's main generics business - copies of conventional chemicals drugs - in the medium term, he said. Stada's generics business carried a margin of 17.3 percent over sales last year. Its biosimilars business has so far generated only negligible volumes.Retzlaff added that generic drugmakers riding the wave of pharmaceuticals losing patent protection needed to gain a foothold in biosimilars or risk running slowly out of business.""We are in for a paradigm shift as more biopharmaceuticals will soon go off-patent than conventional generics,"" said Retzlaff. ""If Stada doesn't have these products in its portfolio after 2020, the company will not be competitive.""Shares in Stada were down 2.3 percent to 28.88 euros by 1128 GMT, underperforming a 1 percent fall in the European healthcare index. Retzlaff said Stada's biotech business would not take off before 2018 but the goal was for biosimilars to account for one third of the group's off-patent prescription drug revenues.Despite a flurry of development activity, the market is still in its infancy with overall biosimilar sales of 60 to million euros ($76 to $89 million) in Germany, Stada says.The European healthcare regulator's website shows it has approved biosimilars of five biotech drugs so far. The biggest players in the industry, who unlike Stada develop the substances in-house, are Novartis's Sandoz unit and Israel's Teva.Stada also sells non-prescription treatments and last year boosted that business by taking over British over-the-counter drug manufacturer Thornton & Ross.    Biotech medicines - made from large protein molecules - have gradually gained importance compared with conventional chemical drugs because they offer more promise to tackle difficult-to- treat conditions such as cancer and auto-immune diseases.

51,"   By Ransdell Pierson  Eli Lilly and Co (LLY.N) said its quarterly earnings plunged 58 percent, hurt by special charges and generic competition for its Cymbalta depression drug, but it affirmed its full-year profit forecast.The U.S. drugmaker on Thursday said it had earned $501 million, or 47 cents per share, in the third quarter. That compared with $1.20 billion, or $1.11 per share, a year earlier.Excluding special items such as charges of $95 million from research collaborations, Lilly earned 66 cents per share. Analysts on average expected 67 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Jefferies analyst Jeffrey Holford said earnings were held back by higher-than-expected research and development costs and sales, general and administrative expenses, but he found no major surprises in the report.   Sales fell 16 percent to $4.88 billion, but topped Wall Street's expectations of $4.83 billion.Lilly's earnings have suffered since late 2011, when its top-selling Zyprexa schizophrenia drug began facing cheaper generics in the United States. The pain worsened last December, when Cymbalta, then its biggest drug, went generic. And its osteoporosis treatment Evista began facing generics in March.Cymbalta's sales fell 73 percent in the third quarter to $368 million, while Evista's tumbled 65 percent to $90 million.Lilly, which has resisted mergers with other big drugmakers to focus on its own experimental drugs, expects new products to help earnings rebound next year.  The company, whose shares slipped 0.6 percent in midday trading, is testing treatments for cancer, arthritis, Alzheimer's disease, cholesterol and psoriasis.U.S. regulators recently approved Jardiance (empagliflozin) and Trulicity (dulaglutide) for type 2 diabetes and granted tentative approval for a generic form of Sanofi SA's (SASY.PA) top-selling Lantus (insulin glargine) insulin. But Lilly will not be able to introduce its biosimilar form of Lantus, called Basaglar, until it resolves patent disputes with Sanofi.   ""The number of Lilly products reaching the market over the next year should set the company up for a return to growth and profit margin improvement next year,"" said Morningstar analyst Damien Conover. ""So we're now at an inflection point."" Conover said Lilly's earnings next year should exceed the approximate 5 percent growth he expects for the industry. But he said Lilly shares were trading at 21 times expected 2015 earnings, a significant premium to most rivals, ""so some of Lilly's return to growth is already priced in.""Sales of many of Lilly's biggest products rose sharply in the quarter, helping offset Cymbalta's swoon. Sales increased 8 percent to $568 million for impotence treatment Cialis and were up 15 percent at $706 million for Humalog insulin.The company's Elanco animal health unit bolstered results, with sales jumping 10 percent to $585 million.Lilly said it still expected 2014 earnings of $2.72 to $2.80 per share, excluding special items. That would represent a decline of as much as 35 percent from last year.

52,"   By Jessica Dye  A U.S. judge on Monday slashed a $9 billion punitive damages award to $36.8 million against Takeda Pharmaceutical Co and Eli Lilly & Co over their Actos diabetes drug, although she rejected their request for a new trial. U.S. District Judge Rebecca Doherty in Louisiana in a court filing granted a motion from the drugmakers to reduce the $9 billion in combined punitive damages awarded earlier this year.In the first federal case to go to trial in a consolidated group of lawsuits, the companies were accused of failing to warn users that Actos could raise the risk for bladder cancer. In her ruling, Doherty said the original $9 billion damages award was ""excessive"" and violated the companies' constitutional rights to due process.She ordered Takeda to pay $27.6 million and Eli Lilly to pay $9.2 million for a total of $36.8 million. Doherty said that, while far smaller than the jury's original award, the reduced punitive damages were still ""large enough to accomplish the jury's clear aim: to send a message to the defendants that their wrongdoing must stop...""The $9 billion in punitive damages was among the largest ever from a U.S. jury. Legal experts doubted it would stand, since appellate courts and the U.S. Supreme Court typically reject punitive damages that are vastly out of proportion to compensatory damages.  In her ruling, Doherty urged the higher courts to give more guidance on whether there should be an upper limit to punitive damages when a jury finds defendants engaged in ""seriously reprehensible behavior.""The companies also had sought a new trial, arguing that the court had made prejudicial rulings on evidence and jury instructions that tainted the trial's outcome. Doherty rejected that request Monday, writing that the evidence during the trial showed that the companies ""disregarded, denied, obfuscated and concealed"" for more than a decade that Actos could increase patients' risk for bladder cancer.  Takeda's U.S. general counsel, Kenneth Greisman, said they viewed the reduced award as a ""step in the right direction,"" but would continue to challenge the verdict on appeal.""Lilly's general counsel, Mike Harrington, said in a statement that the company would continue to fight the verdict. ""While we have empathy for the plaintiff, we believe the evidence did not support his claims,"" he said. Plaintiffs' lawyer Richard Arsenault called the ruling ""thorough"" and noted its focus on the need for ""meaningful deterrence for these multi-national, billion-dollar corporations."" Actos, an oral medication used to regulate blood sugar levels in patients with type-2 diabetes, has been on the market since 1999. Lilly, which co-promoted Actos from 1999 to 2006, has said it will be indemnified by Takeda for its losses and litigation expenses. The case, brought by plaintiff Terrence Allen, is among more than 3,700 consolidated before Doherty. The companies face thousands of additional lawsuits in state courts. The jury had also awarded Allen $1.475 million in compensatory damages, which both parties agreed to reduce to $1.27 million.

55,"  Eli Lilly and Co and German drugmaker Boehringer Ingelheim said they had revised the structure of their diabetes alliance for some countries.Under the alliance signed in 2011, the companies agreed to develop and market diabetes drugs together in more than 50 countries. Boehringer and Lilly will continue to jointly develop and market these drugs in 17 countries, including the United States, they said in a statement on Wednesday. These countries represent over 90 percent of the anticipated market opportunity for these drugs, they said. In the remaining countries, each company will exclusively market the molecules it brought to the alliance and Lilly will receive upfront payments and ongoing payments instead of commissions there. Lilly spokesman Greg Kueterman declined to elaborate on these terms. The U.S. drugmaker will issue a revised 2014 forecast to include the impact of these changed terms, in a regulatory filing, Boehringer and Lilly said. So far, the companies have launched three treatments - Trajenta, Jardiance and Jentadueto - under the alliance. A new insulin glargine product, which is approved in Europe, has won tentative approval in the United States. Sanofi SA said on Tuesday that growth in sales of its diabetes drugs would stall next year due to pricing pressures in the United States. The French drugmaker said it expected sales of diabetes drugs to be flat next year, surprising analysts who had expected double-digit percentage growth.

68,"  Eli Lilly and Co said its experimental drug, ixekizumab, reduced the signs and symptoms of active psoriatic arthritis in patients more than a placebo did in a late-stage trial.Up to 30 percent of psoriasis patients develop psoriatic arthritis, an inflammatory form of arthritis that can cause swelling, stiffness and pain in and around joints, according to the National Psoriasis Foundation.The study, which tested two doses of ixekizumab against a placebo for 24 weeks, showed that Lilly's drug was statistically superior, as demonstrated by the proportion of patients achieving an ACR 20 response.ACR 20 is a standard assessment defined by the American College of Rheumatology as one that reduces the signs and symptoms of a disease by 20 percent. The psoriatic arthritis patients in the trial were required to have had a flare up of symptoms in at least the past six months as well as be untreated by certain drugs.Ixekizumab, a monoclonal antibody, is injected under the skin and is also being tested to treat plaque psoriasis.

69,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, April 21 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings affirms Eli Lilly & Co. Inc.'s (Lilly)  long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A'. In addition, Fitch affirms the  company's short-term IDR at 'F1'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. The rating  actions apply to roughly $7.6 billion of debt outstanding at Dec. 31, 2014. A  full list of the rating actions is provided at the end of this release.  KEY RATING DRIVERS --Fitch views the acquisition of Novartis' Animal Health (NAH) business as  strategically sound, offering Lilly a broader product portfolio, greater  geographic reach, top-line growth opportunities and potential cost savings. --Lilly is nearing the end of its significant patent risk period that  essentially began in 2014 with two of its top drugs, which accounted for roughly  26% of total firm sales, losing patent protection and now accounting for only 7%  of firm sales.  --Fitch expects Lilly will return to top-line organic growth during 2015-2016  with the annualizing of patent expiries and continued strength in established  and new products such as Alimta, Cialis, Effient, Erbitux and  Tradjenta/Jandueto. --Fitch believes Lilly's late-stage pipeline, particularly strong in treatments  for diabetes and cancer, offers the company numerous opportunities to sustain  longer-term growth.  --Lilly's leaner cost structure, growth of patent-protected products and new  product launches should pave the way for margin expansion in 2015-2016 as sales  rebound. --Fitch forecasts that Lilly will generate approximately $400 million to $600  million of free cash flow (FCF; cash flow from operations minus capital  expenditures and dividend payments) in 2015. --Relatively aggressive share repurchases from now through 2017 are incorporated  in Fitch's forecast. However, cash dividend increases are expected to be modest  and acquisitions targeted. --Fitch expects Lilly to operate with leverage (total debt/EBITDA) of 1.5x-1.7x  during 2015. --Fitch assumes the company will maintain adequate liquidity during the forecast  horizon, supported by FCF generation, balance sheet cash, and availability on  its revolving credit facility. ANIMAL HEALTH ACQUISITION GOOD FIT Lilly completed its $5.4 billion NAH acquisition in January 2015, which it  funded with roughly $3.4 billion of international cash and $2 billion in debt.  The acquisition moves Lilly near to the top of the animal health market in terms  of product categories and geographic presence. In addition, Novartis' animal  health product pipeline is reportedly strong and will likely increase Lilly's  long-term growth potential. The newfound scale with its animal health business should also offer efficiency  opportunities. Lilly has stated that it expects to achieve more than $200  million in annual cost synergies within three years after the acquisition. While  acquisition-related top-line synergies are more difficult to quantify and  realize, Fitch believes there will be prospects for enhanced organic growth  stemming from a broader product portfolio. PATENT RISK EASING Lilly is close to exiting its significant patent expiry period that essentially  began in 2014. Its largest selling drug, Cymbalta, lost U.S. patent protection  in December 2013 and European patent protection in August 2014. Cymbalta  accounted for roughly 24% of total company sales during 2013 and accounted for  only 7% in 2015. Evista lost U.S. market exclusivity in March 2014 and accounted  for approximately 4% of total firm revenues, declining to 2% of firm revenues in  2014. To date, no biosimilar competition to Humalog has entered the market,  despite its May 2013 patent expiry.  REBOUND WITH PATENT-PROTECTED PRODUCTS Fitch expects Lilly will return to top-line organic growth during 2015-2016,  achieving annual sales of roughly $19 billion to $21 billion including  meaningful foreign exchange headwinds. Currently marketed drugs including Alimta  (cancer), Cialis (erectile dysfunction), Effient (cardiac thrombosis), Erbitux  (cancer) and Tradjenta/Jandueto (diabetes), in aggregate, have decent  intermediate-term growth potential. These drugs, combined, generate roughly $6.3  billion in annual revenues for Lilly and address large and growing treatment  markets. IMPROVING PIPELINE Lilly has improved its growth prospects for the intermediate-to-longer term, as  it has been making significant progress in building its late-stage pipeline. The  company has a number of late-stage drug candidates and recently launched Cyramza  (cancer)and Trulicity (diabetes). Late stage candidates include potential  treatments for cancer, diabetes, lupus, psoriasis, high cholesterol, depression,  and rheumatoid arthritis. The company has partnered with Boehringer Ingelheim in  its efforts to develop diabetes medications.  COST CONTROL BODES WELL FOR LONGER-TERM MARGIN EXPANSION Lilly has been effective in reducing costs during 2014, as it reduced spending  in SG&A by 7% and R&D by 15% compared to 2013. Much of the decrease was driven  by reducing resources needed to support Cymbalta and Evista, as well as  prioritizing research and development projects. In addition to costs, the growth  in newer, higher-margin products supports the case for margin improvement  beginning in 2015. POSITIVE AND GROWING FCF Fitch forecasts higher FCF of approximately $400 million to $600 million during  2015, as Lilly returns to a period of organic growth and improved margins.  Expected cash flow from operations of roughly $4 billion should be sufficient to  fund approximately $2.2 billion in cash dividends and $1.3 billion in capital  expenditures. Fitch believes FCF will continue to grow from 2014 levels over the  long run, as revenues and margins recover. RELATIVELY AGGRESSIVE CASH DEPLOYMENT Fitch incorporates roughly $4 billion in share repurchases from now through  2017-2018, funded with FCF and cash on hand. However, Fitch models only  incremental dividend increases and targeted acquisitions during the same  forecast period, which will not likely stress Lilly's balance sheet. NAH ACQUISITION DRIVEN LEVERAGE  Fitch looks for Lilly to operate with debt leverage of 1.5x-1.7x during 2015.  The forecasted increase in leverage over early 2014 stems from the increased  debt that the company incurred to fund the acquisition of NAH in early 2015.  Fitch does not expect the company to reduce debt levels during the forecast  period. ADEQUATE LIQUIDITY Fitch assumes Lilly will maintain adequate liquidity, supported by FCF  generation, balance sheet cash and availability on its revolving credit  facility. At Dec. 31, 2014, the company had approximately $4.8 billion of cash  and short-term investments, $3.2 billion of unused committed bank credit  facilities, and roughly $4.6 billion in noncurrent investments. Lilly generated  approximately $1 billion in FCF during the LTM period.  In August 2014, the company refinanced its revolving bank credit facilities and  entered into a $1.20 billion credit facility with a five-year term and a $2.00  billion credit facility with a 364-day term, both of which are available to  support Lilly's commercial paper program. There were no amounts outstanding  under the revolving credit facility during the year ended Dec. 31, 2014.  At Dec. 31, 2014, Lilly had approximately $7.6 billion in debt outstanding.  Fitch believes the company's long-term debt maturities are manageable with  roughly $2.7 billion maturing in 2015, $209 million in 2016, $1 billion in 2017,  $204 million in 2018, and $601 million in 2019. Fitch's forecast assumes that  Lilly will refinance these maturities with new debt issuances. KEY ASSUMPTIONS: Fitch's key assumptions for Lilly's 'A'/Stable Outlook include: --Moderate organic revenue growth, which is mostly offset by the negative effect  of foreign exchange movements during 2015; --Improving margins driven by favorable mix, including new product introductions  and the achievement meaningful cost reduction; --Annual FCF (cash flow from operations minus capital expenditures minus  dividends) of $400 million to $600 million during 2015; --Leverage to remain below 1.7x during 2015; --No major business development initiatives that would meaningfully increase  leverage during 2015. RATING SENSITIVITIES While Fitch does not expect a positive rating action in the near term, future  developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a revision of the  Rating Outlook to Positive in the intermediate term include: --Revenues continue to expand for patent protected products, including Alimta,  Cialis, Cyramza, Effient, Erbitux, Tradjenta/Jandueto and Trulicity; --The company employs adequate cost controls and integration synergies to  generate sufficient profitability while limiting increases in debt to maintain  leverage sustainably below 1.3x; --Cash is deployed conservatively, with the vast majority of the remaining $3.7  billion share repurchase authorization funded with cash flow as opposed to debt  issuance.  Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a Negative  Rating Outlook and/or a one-notch downgrade to 'A-'/'F2' include: --Operational stress from, but not limited to, patent expiries drives leverage  durably above 1.7x; --Inability to extract efficiencies from current operations as well as from the  NAH acquisition; --FCF deteriorates without the expectation of a timely trend reversal. Fitch has affirmed Eli Lilly's ratings as follows: --Long-term IDR at 'A';  --Senior unsecured debt rating at 'A'; --Bank loan rating at 'A'; --Short-term IDR at 'F1'; --Commercial paper rating at'F1'.  The Rating Outlook is Stable.

70,"   By Ransdell Pierson  Eli Lilly and Co (LLY.N) soundly beat quarterly profit estimates on lower-than-expected spending on research and marketing, but revenue slipped as the stronger dollar hurt sales outside the United States. The U.S. drugmaker hopes to begin rebounding this year from three years of plunging sales and earnings caused by patent expirations on some of its biggest products. First-quarter earnings were hurt by generic competition for its Cymbalta depression drug and its Evista treatment for osteoporosis, it said on Thursday.""Lilly has weathered one of the industry's most challenging storms of patent expirations and is primed to grow,"" said Suntrust Robinson Humphrey analyst John Boris.Boris said Lilly had ""a very good quarter,"" and newer treatments for cancer and diabetes should ensure average annual earnings growth in the mid-teens percentage range from 2015 to 2020, topping expected industry growth of about 12 percent.Lilly earned $530 million, or 50 cents per share, in the quarter, compared with $728 million, or 68 cents per share, a year earlier..  Excluding items, the company earned 87 cents per share, well above the analysts' average estimate of 77 cents. Research spending fell 6 percent to $1.04 billion, which Sanford Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson said was about 10 percent below his estimate.Results also benefited from increased stocking of its medicines by distributors, as well as a 42 percent jump in sales of animal health products to $750 million. Animal health is a growing focus for Lilly as people in developing countries rely more on farm animals for dietary protein and embrace companion animals. In January Lilly completed a $5.4 billion purchase of Novartis AG's NOVN.VX(NVS.N) animal health business, making its Elanco unit the world's No. 2 animal-health group by revenue, up from No. 4.The company affirmed its full-year profit forecast of $3.10 to $3.20 per share, excluding special items.While earnings beat expectations, largely on cost-cutting, revenue was just in line, falling about 1 percent to $4.64 billion.  First-quarter revenue would have risen 5 percent if not for the stronger dollar, which lowers the value of sales abroad.Lilly shares were down less than 1 percent at $71.83 in morning trading, amid a moderate downturn for the drug sector.

74,"   By Toni Clarke | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Eli Lilly & Co.'s experimental lung cancer drug necitumumab improved overall survival by an average of 1.6 months but also increased the risk of sometimes fatal blood clots, according to a preliminary review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.The FDA's review was posted on its website on Tuesday ahead of July 9 meeting of outside experts who will discuss the drug and recommend whether it should be approved. The FDA usually follows the advice of its advisory panels.Necitumumab is a second-generation monoclonal antibody for patients with stage IV squamous non-small cell lung cancer.In a 1,093-patient clinical trial patients who received necitumumab together with the chemotherapy drugs gemcitabine and cisplatin survived an average of 11.5 months compared with 9.9 months for patients who received gemcitabine and cisplatin alone.In the necitumumab group, 48 percent of patients experienced serious side effects compared with 38 percent of patients in the control group. There were 66 deaths in the necitumumab group of which 15, or roughly 3 percent, were deemed drug-related. There were 57 deaths in the control group, of which 10, or about 2 percent, were considered drug-related.Analysts on average expect the drug, if approved, to generate annual sales of $582 million by 2020, according to Thomson Reuters data.Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for roughly 85 percent of all lung cancer cases. The squamous form accounts for about 30 percent of NSCLC cases. Lilly also tested the drug in patients with advanced non-squamous NSCLC. The study was closed prematurely due to an imbalance in the number of deaths attributed to potential thromboembolic events, or blood clots. There was no offsetting difference in overall survival.The FDA is seeking the panel's advice on whether the results of the non-squamous trial impact the benefit to risk assessment of the drug in squamous NSCLC.The overall incidence of thromboembolic events was 9 percent in the squamous NSCLC trial compared with 5 percent in the control group. In the non-squamous trial the incidence was 11 percent compared with 6 percent in the control group.

76,"   By Padraic Halpin | DUBLIN, July 16  DUBLIN, July 16 Britain's Immunocore completed Europe's largest ever financing round by a private life sciences company on Thursday, raising $320 million from investors including Eli Lilly & Co, Malin and Woodford Investment Management.The Oxford-based biotech compnay said it will use the proceeds to accelerate its pipeline of new medicines it calls ImmTACs, next-generation cancer drugs that fight tumours in ways antibody drugs cannot.The investment by some of the healthcare sector's ""most highly regarded international institutions"" is another endorsement of that technology, Immunocore Chief Executive Eliot Forster said in a statement.""This funding will be invaluable in assisting us to continue the rapid advancement of IMCgp100 in the clinic,"" he said, referring to its most advanced drug, used to treat melanoma and which produced positive Phase I and II trial data in April.Immunocore's drugs exploit the power of T-cell receptors -- a part of the immune system -- to recognise changes that occur inside cells during cancer or viral infection. ImmTACs then activate the immune system to kill targeted cells. Traditional antibody-based therapies only recognise changes on the surface of cells.Analysts believe that such treatments to exploit the power of the body's immune system may extend patients' lives significantly and generate tens of billions of dollars in annual sales.The funding represents further support for Immunocore's technology, having already signed research and licensing agreements with Lily, Roche, GlaxoSmithKline  and AstraZeneca. Immunocore said the new funding was comfortably oversubscribed and a number of its existing investors took part.Irish life sciences investment firm Malin, which raised 330 million euros ($360.3 million) in one of Europe's biggest life science stock market debuts in March, said on Thursday that it would seek to raise an additional 42 million euros via a private placement. It will sell the shares at 10.99 euros, above the 10 euro-per-share issue price in March, to help with its $80 million investment in Immunocore and said expressions of interest had already been received from existing shareholders.""From a Malin shareholder perspective, the opportunity to be involved in Immunocore is a significant one, and one that we have to take very seriously,"" Malin CEO Adrian Howd, who will join the Immunocore board, told Reuters.""This has probably been one of the most overly subscribed and highly validated rounds I've ever seen for a relatively early stage biotech company.

The study of solanezumab is a large part of the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study, a $100 million, 70-member consortium that has been headquartered at UCSD since its inception in 1991. However, the ADCS has been embroiled in litigation since the departure of its director of eight years, Dr. Paul Aisen, who moved to USC in June. In a lawsuit filed July 2, the UC regents accused USC of conspiring with Aisen and several of his colleagues, who also moved to USC in recent months, in an attempt to take the ADCS with them.

85,"   By Ransdell Pierson  Eli Lilly and Co has stopped a late-stage trial of its closely watched cholesterol treatment after it proved ineffective, sending its stock down more than 9 percent and casting greater skepticism over the potentially lucrative class of medicines.The setback, announced by the company on Monday, also hit shares of Merck & Co Inc, which is now the only major drugmaker still moving aggressively ahead with a member of the novel family of drugs called CETP inhibitors. ""Today's news is a negative for Lilly and we anticipate that investors will also likely read across negatively for Merck,""  Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum said in a research note. Merck stock fell as much as 2.5 percent. Lilly's drug evacetrapib, like rival CETP inhibitors, is meant to sharply raise ""good"" HDL cholesterol while cutting levels of ""bad"" LDL cholesterol. Current cholesterol fighters called statins, such as Pfizer Inc's Lipitor, prevent artery-clogging by slashing LDL levels, but have little impact on heart-protective HDL.Lilly said it stopped the evacetrapib study on the recommendation of an independent data-monitoring committee, which cited insufficient efficacy of the drug. The study was not stopped due to safety concerns, Lilly added. Jefferies analyst Jeffrey Holford had been counting on evacetrapib to be approved in 2017 and generate eventual annual sales of $5 billion for Lilly. He now expects no sales from the drug, even though Lilly will continue to test it in smaller ongoing studies.   Pfizer’s CETP inhibitor, torcetrapib, was scrapped in 2006 after being linked to deaths in a large $800 million study, dashing the company's hopes it would be approved and generate annual sales of over $10 billion. A second CETP inhibitor, Roche Holding AG's dalcetrapib, was ditched in 2012 due to lack of benefit. Merck is conducting a late-stage trial of its candidate, anacetrapib, that is expected to conclude in 2017.  In mid-stage studies, the Merck drug raised HDL levels by a whopping 138 percent, while cutting LDL by 40 percent. But the big question is whether it will safely reduce deaths, heart attacks and strokes - goals that have eluded its rivals.Analysts said Merck's drug is the only major remaining CETP inhibitor and remains a potential strong competitor to two recently approved cholesterol drugs called PCSK9 inhibitors that can slash LDL levels 60 percent beyond reductions seen with statins alone.The PCSK9 inhibitors are Praluent from Regeneron Inc and Sanofi, and Repatha from Amgen Inc, both deemed potential blockbusters. Indianapolis-based Lilly is conducting no other late-stage trials of cardiovascular drugs, one of its seven key areas.Lilly said it will take a charge of up to $90 million, or 5 cents per share, in its fourth quarter due to the setback.Lilly shares were down 8 percent to $79.22 on the New York Stock Exchange.

88,"  SHANGHAI Oct 12 Eli Lilly and Co has expanded a tie-up up with China-based biopharmaceutical company Innovent Biologics Inc to develop cancer treatments for the fast-growing Chinese market, the two companies said in a joint statement on Monday.The U.S. drugmaker, which first announced the tie-up earlier this year, said the two companies would work together to develop and commercialise up to three cancer treatments over the next decade for the Chinese and global markets.Innovent could receive extra payments of up to $1 billion if the cancer products hit certain development, regulatory and sales targets, the statement said. China is seeing a sharp rise in cancer cases, with around 3 million cases of cancer each year and around 2 million deaths, according to a statement from the country's National Health and Family Planning Commission in September. Hospital cancer drug raked in sales of about 52 billion yuan ($8.23 billion) in 2014, making it the fourth-largest drug segment in the country, with international firms holding just over a third of the market, according to Deutsche Bank. The companies said in March Innovent would receive an upfront fee of $56 million.

89,"   By Ransdell Pierson  Eli Lilly & Co (LLY.N) reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings due to cost controls and sales of new treatments for diabetes and cancer, keeping the U.S. drugmaker on track for its planned return to growth this year.Lilly raised its full-year profit forecast to reflect expected investment gains and lower spending on research and marketing.   ""We are encouraged by the combination of Lilly's new product cycle coupled with expense management, which we see driving healthy earnings growth over the next five years"" or longer, J.P. Morgan analyst Chris Schott said in a research note.Lilly has been strapped with declining sales and earnings since 2011 after sales of its biggest products plunged due to competition from cheaper generics.But the Indianapolis drugmaker has refused to consider merging with another large drugmaker, saying its own pipeline of experimental drugs would restore earnings growth by 2015. Cyramza, the company's new treatment for lung cancer, posted sales of $111 million in the quarter, while the company's recently approved diabetes drug Trulicity pulled in $74 million. One the company's most promising drugs is Jardiance, following data last month from a large trial that showed the pill slashed deaths 32 percent among patients with type 2 diabetes at risk of heart attack. Jardiance had sales of just $15 million in the quarter, but analysts expect it to eventually post big sales if medical societies recommend early use of the drug. Lilly expects a profit of $3.40 to $3.45 per share this year, excluding special items, from its earlier view of $3.20 to $3.30 per share. That would reflect growth of up to 24 percent over last year. Edward Jones analyst Ashtyn Evans on Thursday maintained her ""hold"" rating on Lilly, saying its shares trade at a premium to most rivals and already reflect the company's improving earnings prospects and strong lineup of experimental drugs.Company sales rose 2 percent in the quarter to $4.96 billion, slightly below Wall Street expectations. They would have risen 10 percent if not for the stronger U.S. dollar.Net quarterly profit rose to $799.7 million, or 75 cents per share, from $500.6 million, or 47 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding special items, Lilly earned 89 cents per share, handily beating the average analyst estimate of 76 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Lilly shares fell 0.6 percent, amid a 0.5 percent decline for the drug sector.

94,"   By John Miller | ZURICH  ZURICH Eli Lilly's plan to close a Swiss laboratory that conducts tests and experiments on live animals has caused concerns by a local animal welfare group over the fate of the facility's hundreds of dogs, cats and livestock.The U.S.-based company said on Thursday it was working to secure new owners for many of the animals as its Elanco animal health company may shut the research center in the Swiss town of Saint-Aubin, about 25 kilometers (15.53 miles) southwest of the Swiss capital of Berne. But Julika Fitzi, a veterinarian and lawyer who works with the group Swiss Animal Protection, worries many may be killed.""We want to work closely with Elanco to find individual places for as many of the animals as possible,"" Fitzi said Thursday. ""These animals have earned a future that includes more than being killed."" Fitzi said the laboratory houses about 350 dogs, 170 cats, 280 sheep, cattle and pigs and about 200 mice, figures that Eli Lilly didn't confirm, and she had been told by the company last month it did not need her group's help in finding them new homes.The expected closure comes as Eli Lilly looks to concentrate some of its Swiss research activities in Basel following its acquisition of the animal health business of Novartis earlier this year for $5.8 billion.  Its Saint-Aubin research and development facility has been the site of bioanalytics and clinical pathology research, as well as research and in-vitro screening work in relation to animal parasites.Elanco's spokeswoman Maria Zampaglione said on Thursday the company will make a final decision on the Saint-Aubin research site later this month.She said that if it is closed the company's primary plan for so-called ""companion animals"" such as cats and dogs would be ""transfer of ownership to other facilities and employee pet owners.""""We have already identified the appropriate relocation options for all livestock, companion animals and fish on the site,"" Zampaglione told Reuters in an email. What to do with animals used in research and testing which are no longer needed due to age or the ending of a research program, is an issue for many companies.European rival Bayer's animal health unit in Germany says on its website that it placed 3,000 animals including cats and dogs with adoptive owners after they were no longer needed for research.However, animal testing itself by companies and research bodies such as universities remains a sensitive and controversial issue.

98,"   By Ransdell Pierson and Amrutha Penumudi  Eli Lilly and Co on Tuesday forecast 2016 revenue below expectations but said that its Jardiance diabetes treatment grabbed market share during the fourth quarter, which helped shares rise as much as 3 percent. Lilly's head of diabetes, Enrique Conterno, told investors on a conference call that new data released in September about Jardiance's favorable effect on heart health had caused a surge in new patients to the drug.John Boris, an analyst with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, said shares were also helped by the company's statements on the call that it expects to have data in the fourth quarter of this year from a late-stage trial of its Alzheimer's disease treatment, solanezumab. It also said it may begin late-stage trials this year of another high-profile Alzheimer's treatment, which belongs to a different class called BACE inhibitors.Earlier on Tuesday, the company said in a news release that it expected revenue of $20.2 billion to $20.7 billion for 2016, below the average analyst estimate of $21.36 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.The drugmaker's adjusted profit forecast of $3.45 to $3.55 per share also fell short of analysts' expectations of $3.65. Analysts said the forecast was ""very conservative"" and pointed to uncertainty on foreign exchange trends.Foreign exchange headwinds account for about $675 million of the $1 billion miss on the revenue forecast, Bernstein analysts wrote in a note.  Excluding foreign exchange headwinds, the forecast represented a growth of mid to high single digit, ""which is quite healthy versus peer companies,"" they wrote. Lilly estimated earnings of $2.28-$2.33 per share for 2015, below its forecast of $2.40-$2.45, citing an after-tax charge of about 12 cents per share related to the acquisition of rights to a glucagon nasal spray from Locemia Solutions.Lilly has recently launched its Jardiance treatment for diabetes and Cyramza drug for colon and lung cancer.

102,"  U.S. health regulators said on Tuesday they have approved a drug from Eli Lilly and Co to treat adults with moderate to severe cases of the skin condition plaque psoriasis.The injectable biotech medicine known chemically as ixekizumab will be sold under the brand name Taltz, the Food and Drug Administration said.Taltz works by blocking a protein that causes inflammation, which is believed to play a role in development of the autoimmune disorder characterized by red skin and thick, unsightly, scaly white patches. In large, late-stage clinical trials, ixekizumab led to significant skin clearing compared with a placebo and also helped patients who did not respond to Amgen Inc's blockbuster treatment Enbrel. ""Today’s approval provides patients suffering from plaque psoriasis with another important treatment option to help relieve the skin irritation and discomfort from the condition,” Julie Beitz, from the FDA's Office of Drug Evaluation, said in a statement.

103,"  FRANKFURT, April 19 Boehringer Ingelheim, Germany's second-largest drugmaker, posted 11 percent higher sales and a 6 percent gain in operating profit for 2015, boosted by its diabetes treatment business, where it collaborates with Eli Lilly.Excluding Boehringer's U.S. generics business - sold to Hikma Pharmaceuticals Plc at the beginning of this year - and the effect of currency swings, sales rose 5.3 percent.Full-year operating profit rose to 2.3 billion euros ($2.60 billion), on 14.8 billion euros in sales, the unlisted family-owned group said on Tuesday. The group, which invented mass production of baking powder in the 1890s, said sales at its diabetes portfolio gained a currency-adjusted 49 percent to 1.1 billion euros, with the prospect of driving growth over the long term. Eli Lilly's new Jardiance diabetes treatment, sold together with Boehringer, earlier this year began stealing market share from rival drugs in its class, bolstered by clinical trials showing it slashed deaths by 32 percent in patients with Type 2 diabetes.

107,"   By Sarah N. Lynch | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Some major U.S. drug companies have hired their own auditors to perform compliance reviews mandated in government settlements over alleged civil violations, such as paying kickbacks or off-label drug promotion, according to federal records reviewed by Reuters.Third-party compliance reviews are playing an increasingly large role in helping the government ensure companies fulfill their obligations in federal settlements.But unlike the Justice Department or the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Department of Health and Human Services inspector general does not prohibit companies from hiring firms with whom they have existing business ties.Some lawmakers and legal experts say that practice creates conflicts of interest and could impair outside reviewers' independence.""If the goal of this whole thing is to have an energetic and independent reviewer ferreting out mistakes and potential fraud within the company, do not put them under the financial thumb of the people who have millions of dollars at stake in keeping the audit work,"" said Kevin Outterson, a professor of health and corporate law at Boston University.Several large drug makers - including Novartis, GlaxoSmithKline, Merck, Sanofi and Allergan Inc. - have relied on their existing or previous auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) or Ernst & Young (EY), to also serve as compliance reviewers, according to corporate filings and a list of reviewers.The health agency's inspector general provided the list of reviewers hired by drug companies in response to a Reuters Freedom of Information Act request.The inspector general typically settles civil claims through the use of a ""corporate integrity agreement"" mandating various reforms.These five-year deals often require the hiring of an independent compliance consultant known as an ""independent review organization,"" which is tasked with reviewing internal policies and data, such as payments to doctors.In exchange, the inspector general's office agrees not to exclude a company from participating in Medicaid and Medicare.Susan Gillin, an attorney in the inspector general's office, said she agreed that “theoretically, a potential conflict of interest exists.”But she said her agency has not observed any problems with weak oversight by auditors serving in dual roles. Such arrangements are allowed, she said, as long as the firm is not involved in corporate management or advising on policies it will also review.""We have very few repeat parties to corporate integrity agreements,” she said.  While some companies have had multiple settlements over the years, they typically cover different alleged violations, or conduct committed by companies that, between settlements, became part of a different firm through an acquisition, Gillin said.Spokespeople for Novartis, Merck, GlaxoSmithKline and Sanofi all said they disclosed their business relationships to the inspector general, which reviewed them. A spokesman for Allergan Plc. said the arrangement predated the company's acquisition by Actavis in March 2015.Executives at PwC and Ernst & Young told Reuters they believe their dual work auditing and conducting compliance reviews are not in conflict and that they comply with all applicable regulations.The compliance reviewers “are independent in fact and in appearance,"" said EY Vice Chair Ron Hauben.Nancy Beacham, a partner at PwC, said the firm adheres to federal standards for all public company auditing engagements.""We abide by the rules of what we can and cannot do,"" she said. BIG CONTRACTS AT STAKE Some legal experts who see a conflict in the dual role say it can be exacerbated by the fact that accounting firms are generally paid more for their audit work than for these sorts of compliance reviews.For example, prior to Allergan Inc's acquisition by Actavis in March 2015, the company disclosed that in fiscal year 2012, it paid Ernst & Young more than $5 million in audit fees, compared with more than $440,000 it paid the firm for compliance work performed under the corporate integrity agreement.""Work with a major company is an important contract, and an established contractor isn't going to be independent,"" said Brandon Garrett, a professor at the University of Virginia School of Law.Senate Judiciary Chairman Charles Grassley, an Iowa Republican, said such arrangements could weaken enforcement.""If the firms enforcing the agreements aren't independent,” he told Reuters in a statement, that “defeats the purpose of the agreements.""While some companies hire their auditors as reviewers, the majority of the more than two dozen public companies reviewed by Reuters that have or had corporate integrity agreements - such as Pfizer, CVS Caremark and Eli Lilly - do not hire their own auditors and instead opt for consulting or law firms. HISTORY OF VIOLATIONS Pricewaterhouse's current dual clients for audits and compliance reviews include Novartis and Merck, according to the list provided by the health agency's inspector general.GlaxoSmithKline previously engaged its auditor, PwC, for a compliance review which ended in 2012.EY currently performs dual work for Sanofi and it previously did dual work for Allergan Inc. prior to its acquisition.GlaxoSmithKine, Novartis and Merck have all been involved in multiple settlements with the U.S. government since 1991 to resolve a range of criminal and civil claims, according to a recent report by the nonprofit watchdog Public Citizen. [ID: nL2N17122L]GlaxoSmithKline has paid nearly $8 billion in federal fines between 1991 and 2015 - the most of any drugmaker, according to the Public Citizen report.A GlaxoSmithKline spokeswoman said the company has greatly improved its compliance by taking steps such as eliminating payments to doctors who speak on the company's behalf and ending sales incentives based on prescription volumes.Novartis, in 2010, settled civil charges of paying kickbacks to doctors who spoke at corporate events, and signed a corporate integrity agreement.The company now faces another civil lawsuit filed by federal and state prosecutors, which alleges that kickbacks to doctors continued for nearly a year after it signed its 2010 corporate integrity agreement with the health agency's inspector general.Novartis has sought to dismiss the case, saying it makes ""sweeping"" allegations of a ""decade-long, nationwide fraudulent scheme based on just fifteen doctors.""

111,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, July 22 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Eli Lilly & Co. Inc.'s  (Lilly) Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A' with a Stable Outlook.  Fitch also affirmed the company's short-term IDR at 'F1'. The rating actions  apply to roughly $7.8 billion of debt outstanding at Mar. 31, 2016. A full list  of the rating actions is provided at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS --Lilly is facing a manageable patent expiry period, with roughly 22% of total  sales at risk through 2018. Nearly half of those sales come from biologics,  which generally experience relatively moderate sales decline once their patents  expire.  --Fitch expects Lilly will return to top-line organic growth during 2016-2018  with the annualizing of patent expiries and continued strength in established  and new products. --Fitch believes Lilly's late-stage pipeline, particularly strong in treatments  for diabetes and cancer, offers the company numerous opportunities to sustain  longer-term growth. --Lilly's leaner cost structure, growth of patent-protected products and new  product launches should pave the way for margin expansion in 2016 as sales  rebound. --Fitch forecasts that Lilly will generate solid free cash flow (FCF; cash flow  from operations minus capital expenditures and dividend payments) in 2016. --The rating incorporates moderate share repurchases, targeted acquisitions and  incremental dividend increases through the forecast period. Manageable Patent Expiry Risk: Lilly faces patent expiries for Erbitux in  February 2016 (3% of firm sales), Effient in October 2017 (2% of firm sales),  Strattera in May 2017 (4% of firm sales), Cialis in November 2017 (12% of firm  sales) and Forteo in December 2018 (7% of firm sales). However, Erbitux and  Forteo are biologics, which generally lose sales to biosimilar competition at a  much slower pace than small molecules (Cialis) do when experiencing generic  competition. As such, Fitch views the company's patent expiry risk as  manageable. Lilly recently exited its significant patent expiry period which essentially  began in 2014. Its largest selling drug, Cymbalta, lost U.S. patent protection  in December 2013 and European patent protection in August 2014. Cymbalta  accounted for roughly 24% of total company sales during 2013 and accounted for  only 7% in 2015. Evista lost U.S. market exclusivity in March 2014 and now  accounts for approximately 1% of total firm revenues. To date, no biosimilar  competition to Humalog has entered the market, despite its May 2013 patent  expiry. Rebound With Patent-Protected Products: Fitch expects Lilly will return to  top-line organic growth during 2016-2018, achieving annual sales in excess of  $20 billion, including meaningful foreign exchange headwinds. In our view,  currently marketed drugs including Cyramza (cancer), Trulicity (diabetes), Taltz  (psoriasis), Jardiance (diabetes) and Tradjenta/Jandueto (diabetes), in  aggregate, show reasonable intermediate-term growth potential.  Pipeline Underpins Long-Term Growth: Lilly has improved its growth prospects for  the intermediate- to longer term, as it has been making significant progress in  building its late-stage pipeline. The company has a number of late-stage drug  candidates, and recently launched Basaglar (diabetes), Cyramza (cancer),  Jardiance (diabetes), Portrazza (cancer), Trulicity (diabetes) and Taltz  (psoriasis). Late-stage candidates include potential treatments for cancer,  diabetes, lupus, depression, and rheumatoid arthritis. The company has partnered  with Boehringer Ingelheim in its efforts to develop diabetes medications as well  as evaluate therapy combinations in treating cancer. Support for Margin Expansion: Lilly improved its EBITDA margin to 26% during the  LTM ended March 31, 2016, versus 25.1% in the prior year period. A 220bps  improvement in SG&A (as a percentage of sales) more than offset a 60bps decline  in gross margin and a 90bps increase in R&D (as a percentage of sales). Fitch  expects the company will continue to improve gross margins during the  intermediate term through the growth in recently- or to-be-introduced,  higher-margin products. Growing FCF: Fitch forecasts higher FCF of approximately $800 million during  2016 as Lilly generates organic growth and improved margins. Expected cash flow  from operations of roughly $4.2 billion should be sufficient to fund  approximately $2.2 billion in cash dividends and $1.1 billion in capital  expenditures. Fitch believes FCF will continue to grow from 2015 levels over the  long run, as revenues and margins advance. Share Repurchases to Continue: Fitch incorporates roughly $2 billion - $3  billion in aggregate share repurchases from now through 2018, funded with cash  on hand. However, Fitch models only incremental dividend increases and targeted  acquisitions during the same forecast period, which will not likely stress  Lilly's balance sheet. We believe Lilly would moderate its share repurchases if  it were to pursue somewhat more strategic acquisitions. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions for Lilly's 'A'/Stable Outlook include: --Moderate organic revenue growth, mostly offset by the negative effect of  foreign exchange movements during 2016; --Improving margins driven by favorable mix, including new product introductions  and the achievement of meaningful cost reduction; --Annual FCF (cash flow from operations minus capital expenditures minus  dividends) of roughly $800 million during 2016; --Leverage to remain below 1.6x during 2016. RATING SENSITIVITIES While Fitch does not expect a positive rating action in the near term, future  developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a revision of the  Rating Outlook to Positive or an upgrade in the intermediate term, include: --Revenues continue to expand for patent-protected products, including Cyramza,  Jardiance, Taltz, Tradjenta/Jandueto and Trulicity; --The company attains adequate cost controls and integration synergies to  generate sufficient profitability while limiting increases in debt to maintain  leverage sustainably below 1.3x; --Lilly deploys cash conservatively with a bias of using cash flow as opposed to  debt issuance to fund transactions.  Future developments that may individually or collectively, lead to a Negative  Outlook and/or a one-notch downgrade to 'A-'/'F2' include: --Operational stress from factors including, but not limited to, patent expiries  drive leverage durably above 1.7x; --Inability to maintain relatively strong operations through the intermediate  term, patent expiry period; --FCF deteriorates without the expectation of a timely trend reversal. LIQUIDITY Adequate Liquidity: Fitch assumes Lilly will maintain adequate liquidity,  supported by FCF generation, balance sheet cash and availability on its  revolving credit facility. At March 31, 2016, the company had approximately $3  billion of cash and short-term investments, $1.2 billion of unused committed  bank credit facilities, and roughly $3.8 billion in noncurrent investments.  At March 31, 2016, Lilly had approximately $7.8 billion in debt outstanding.  Fitch believes the company's long-term debt maturities are manageable with  roughly $635 million maturing in 2017, $800 million in 2018, and $600 million in  2019. Fitch's forecast assumes that Lilly will refinance these maturities with  new debt issuances. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has affirmed Eli Lilly & Co. Inc.'s ratings as follows: --Long-Term IDR at 'A';  --Senior unsecured debt rating at 'A'; --Bank loan rating at 'A'; --Short-Term IDR at 'F1'; --Commercial paper rating at'F1'.  The Rating Outlook is Stable.

112,"   By Ransdell Pierson  Eli Lilly and Co on Tuesday reported better-than-expected quarterly sales, fueled by newer drugs, and predicted average annual revenue growth of at least 5 percent through the end of the decade due to its growing roster of medicines. The Indianapolis drugmaker, whose earnings growth resumed last year after three years of tumbling sales caused by competition from generic drugs, said investors can count on annual dividend increases in 2016 and beyond. Revenue rose 9 percent to $5.4 billion in the second quarter, topping Wall Street estimates of $5.15 billion.Credit-Suisse analyst Vamil Divan said surprisingly strong sales were seen for some older brands, including its Cialis impotence treatment and Forteo osteoporosis drug, which both benefited from higher prices. Newer drugs that are key to Lilly's turnaround are the main focus of investors, and performed well in the quarter. Trulicity, an injectable diabetes treatment that competes with Novo Nordisk's blockbuster Victoza, posted sales of $201 million, while sales of two-year-old Cyramza for stomach and lung cancer vaulted 68 percent to $147 million.Wall Street expects another new drug for type 2 diabetes, Jardiance, to become a $3 billion-a-year product by 2021 because of recent clinical data showing that it slashes the risk of cardiovascular death. But Jardiance, a so-called SGLT-2 inhibitor that competes with Johnson & Johnson's Invokana, posted a disappointing $40.1 million in quarterly sales as U.S. health regulators weigh whether to include the favorable new clinical data in its label. Once in the label, Lilly could promote the data to doctors and drive sales higher.  In a conference call with analysts on Tuesday, Lilly said it plans to unveil data later this year on solanezumab, its experimental treatment for Alzheimer's disease, and could seek  U.S. approval within months for a breast cancer drug that could compete with Pfizer Inc's similar Ibrance.""Lilly is doing an excellent job, coming out of its patent cliff, and is poised to release a lot of new drugs,"" said Morningstar analyst Damien Conover. Lilly's net income rose 24.5 percent to $747.7 million, or 71 cents per share, in the quarter.Excluding special items, including restructuring charges,  Lilly earned 86 cents per share, in line with the average analyst estimate, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Lilly reaffirmed it expects full-year earnings of $3.50 to $3.60 per share, excluding special items. That would reflect growth of up to 5 percent over last year.

117,"   By Ransdell Pierson  Eli Lilly & Co will likely step up the pace of making deals with other drugmakers while aggressively developing new drugs on its own, the company's newly appointed chief executive said on Wednesday.Company veteran David Ricks will become CEO on Jan. 1, after John Lechleiter, 62, retires by year-end, the Indianapolis-based drugmaker said.Ricks, 49, has served since 2012 as president of Lilly Bio-Medicines, where he has overseen late-stage drug trials and global marketing.

118,"  (Adds details)July 27 U.S. drugmaker Eli Lilly and Co  said on Wednesday John Lechleiter, its chief executive of eight years, would retire by the end of the year and would be succeeded by senior vice president David Ricks on January 1.Lechleiter, who  became the CEO in April 2008, has steered the company through a steep patent cliff by reinvigorating its pipeline.Lilly has made great progress building an R&D engine that has the potential to launch 20 new products in 10 years beginning in 2014, Lechleiter noted in the company's earnings release on Tuesday. Earnings growth at the Indianapolis-based drugmaker resumed last year after three years of tumbling sales.The company's internal pipeline is well positioned to mitigate patent losses during the next decade, Morningstar analyst Damien Conover wrote on Tuesday. Lilly on Tuesday reported better-than-expected quarterly sales, fueled by newer drugs, and predicted average annual revenue growth of at least 5 percent through the end of the decade due to its growing roster of medicines.Lechleiter joined Lilly in 1979 as a senior organic chemist and later took on roles that involved pharmaceutical product development, regulatory affairs and operations. Since 2012, Ricks has served as president of Lilly Bio-Medicines, the largest of the company's five businesses in terms of sales.The unit also accounts for nearly half the company's mid-to-late-stage pipeline assets.The 140-year old company's shares were unchanged in premarket trading.

125,"  U.S. drugmaker Eli Lilly and Co on Wednesday said it would continue a late-stage trial of its experimental breast cancer drug in combination with a widely used treatment even though an independent panel determined the combination therapy failed to meet its interim effectiveness goal. The independent data monitoring committee recommended the trial continue without modification through the first half of 2017 despite the fact that its interim look at the data suggested the combination treatment was not delaying progression of the disease.Lilly shares were down 1.2 percent in morning trading.Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez said continuation of the study, called Monarch 2, would allow Lilly to better understand abemaciclib, which is also being tested in a variety of other trials.The Monarch 2 study included 669 patients who had previously failed to benefit from anti-estrogen treatment for metastatic breast cancer. It compared combined use of abemaciclib and anti-estrogen therapy fulvestrant with fulvestrant alone. Lilly's drug is from the same new class of breast cancer treatments as Pfizer Inc's recently approved Ibrance, which brought in more than half a billion dollars in second-quarter sales. They work through a new mechanism, by blocking the proteins CDK 4 and CDK 6.Lilly is evaluating abemaciclib as a single agent in breast cancer patients who have not derived enough benefit from prior treatments. Three other studies are testing abemaciclib with other drugs. Abemaciclib, which was granted the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) breakthrough therapy status for breast cancer last year, is also being tested for use in lung cancer.After skin cancer, breast cancer is the most common cancer among women in the United States, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). About 40,000 of the 220,000 American women diagnosed with breast cancer die each year, the CDC estimates.

The trial will continue into the first half of 2017 and will include a final analysis of progression-free survival, overall survival and safety data, the U.S. drugmaker said on Wednesday.

131,"  Sept 20 Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc  and Israeli drugmaker Teva Pharmaceutical Industries  on Tuesday said they would co-develop Regeneron's experimental new type of pain drug and together market the medicine if it succeeds in trials and is approved.The injectable drug, called fasinumab, blocks Nerve Growth Factor (NGF), a protein involved in transmission of pain signals. Its new mechanism of action could make it a non-addictive alternative to opioids, the drugmakers said in a joint release. It is being tested in late-stage trials for osteoarthritis pain and in mid-stage studies for chronic low back pain. Rival U.S. drugmakers Eli Lilly and Co and Pfizer Inc plan by 2018 to seek approval for their similar medicine, tanezumab, which they are testing under a $1.8 billion deal reached in 2013. Teva, a generic drugmaker that sells the branded multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone, will pay Regeneron $250 million upfront and share equally in fasinumab's ongoing research costs of about $1 billion. U.S.-based Regeneron, best known for its blockbuster Eylea treatment for macular degeneration, has been attempting for years to develop an anti-NGF drug for pain, but has been stymied by safety concerns over the new approach.

""Today is the beginning of the holiday, so many people have left or are on their way,"" said Ken Polcari, director of the NYSE floor division at O'Neil Securities in New York.""You could continue to see a little bit an overreaction either way just because there are less people. But I think next week - Monday, Tuesday - I think then you'll see the market digest a little bit, I wouldn't be surprised to see the market back off.""Eli Lilly was the biggest drag on the S&P 500, falling  11.5 percent after the company said it would stop developing its Alzheimer's drug following a trail failure. Biogen, which is developing a similar drug, fell 4.2 percent.At 2:57 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones industrial average  was up 36.67 points, or 0.19 percent, to 19,060.54, the S&P 500  had lost 1.33 points, or 0.06 percent, to 2,201.61 and the Nasdaq Composite had dropped 17.40 points, or 0.32 percent, to 5,368.95.The Dow hit a record intraday high for the third straight day earlier in the session, and was on track to close at an all-time high.The S&P 500 industrial sector rose 0.7 percent to a record high, helped by a report showing a strong jump in durable goods orders in October due to demand for machinery and other equipment. Caterpillar rose 2.7 percent to $96.16, while the Dow transportation average rose 0.8 percent. Deere  jumped 10.8 percent to a record high after the farm equipment maker reported a much smaller-than-expected decline in profit.The industrial sector had risen roughly 7 percent since the U.S. election on bets that President-elect Donald Trump's plans to boost infrastructure spending would benefit the industry.In other healthcare shares, Juno Therapeutics sank 27 percent after reporting that two patients died during a trial of its leukemia drug.The market will be closed on Thursday and close early on Friday.Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.24-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.14-to-1 ratio favored advancers.The S&P 500 posted 63 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 295 new highs and 19 new lows.
