The FTC gave its approval without requiring the companies to divest any stores, a law firm that represented Harris Teeter said in a statement.The FTC was not immediately available for comment.The deal, approved by the boards of both companies in July, will boost Kroger's presence in the U.S. southeast.

Cincinnati-based Kroger, the largest mainstream U.S. grocer, will also get a bigger presence in the mid-Atlantic region, slightly more upscale stores that do a strong business in fresh food and access to fast-growing markets. As the supermarket industry has consolidated, chains such as Harris Teeter, based in Matthews, North Carolina, have struggled to maintain market share against rivals such as Wal-Mart, Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O) and Whole Foods Market Inc (WFM.O).Harris Teeter currently operates 212 supermarkets in North Carolina, Virginia, South Carolina, Maryland, Tennessee, Delaware, Florida, Georgia and the District of Columbia.

2,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, January 23 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a rating of â€˜BBBâ€™ to The  Kroger Co.â€™s (Kroger) issuance of $500 million of 10-year senior unsecured  notes. Kroger intends to use the proceeds from the notes to refinance notes that  matured on Jan. 15, 2014 and for general corporate purposes. As of Nov. 9, 2013,  Kroger had $8.3 billion of debt outstanding, including capital leases. The  Rating Outlook is Stable. A full list of rating actions is shown below.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Kroger's ratings are supported by its industry-leading sales growth and market  share gains balanced against ongoing share repurchase activity and intense price  competition that will continue to pressure gross margins. The ratings also take  into account Krogerâ€™s planned merger with Harris Teeter Supermarkets, Inc.  (HTSI), a regional supermarket chain located in the southeast that Kroger has  agreed to acquire for $2.5 billion (7.3x EBITDA).  Fitch views the addition of HTSI as neutral-to-moderately positive from a  business perspective, and believes that the risks associated with integrating  HTSI into Krogerâ€™s network are manageable. In addition, financial leverage,  after initially increasing to a pro forma 3.3x on an adjusted debt/EBITDAR  basis, is expected to recover to near 3.0x within 18-24 months after the close  of the acquisition.   In light of the challenges facing the supermarket industry, including  competitive pressures from discount formats and the margin compression that has  occurred since 2009, adjusted leverage of around 3x would be at the high end of  the rating level, and does not afford much cushion for additional leveraging  actions or operating shortfalls.  Steady Operating Results Kroger generates industry-leading non-fuel identical store (ID) sales as a  result of strong pricing perception by customers, effective marketing through  use of loyalty card data, and improvements to the shopping experience. ID sales  growth of 3.4% in the first three quarters of 2013 follows increases of 3.5% in  2012 and 4.9% in 2011, leading to market share gains in most of its major  markets. The company has achieved these results despite the weak consumer  environment and intense competition from discount and specialty formats. Kroger has gradually managed down its gross margin ratio, and has offset this  pressure with cost containment efforts and the leveraging of fixed costs. The  EBIT margin on a first in-first out (FIFO) basis excluding fuel and the effect  of the extra week (in 2012) was up slightly in each of 2011 and 2012, and in the  LTM period, and is expected to be flat-to-slightly improved going forward.  Free cash flow (FCF) after dividends is expected to track around $300 million  annually going forward, below the $500 million achieved in 2011-2012, due to an  increase in capex driven by managementâ€™s desire to accelerate its store growth  pace.   RATING SENSITIVITIES  A positive rating action would be considered if adjusted leverage improved to  the mid-2x range, together with steady mid-single-digit ID sales growth and  gradual margin improvement. A negative rating action would be considered if adjusted leverage does not  improve to a level near 3x within 18 to 24 months after the close of the HTSI  acquisition due to pressure on margins and/or a more aggressive approach to  share repurchases or acquisitions. Fitch rates Kroger as follows:  --Long-term IDR 'BBB';  --Senior unsecured notes 'BBB'; --Bank credit facility 'BBB'; --Short-term IDR 'F2'; --Commercial paper 'F2'.  The Rating Outlook is Stable.

13,"   By Lisa Baertlein and Shailaja Sharma  Kroger Co said on Wednesday it would buy Vitacost.com Inc, a health products retailer, for about $280 million in a bid to expand its presence in the profitable health and wellness niche popularized by Whole Foods Market Inc.A growing number of U.S. shoppers are willing to pay extra for products such as organic foods, local produce and specialty items such as vitamins and other supplements. Eyeing bigger profits, grocery sellers from Kroger to Wal-Mart Stores Inc and drugstore chain CVS Caremark Corp are hoping to cash in on the trend.Shares in Vitacost soared after the announcement of the deal, which also could bolster Kroger's e-commerce capabilities. In early-afternoon trading, Vitacost jumped 27 percent to $7.98, while Kroger slipped 0.2 percent to $49.44.Boca Raton, Florida-based Vitacost sells a range of products, including vitamins, herbal remedies and other supplements as well as organic, gluten-free and other specialty food products to about 2.3 million regular customers. With the tie-up, Kroger, the biggest U.S. supermarket operator, could also expand sales of its own Simple Truth products that are organic or made without some preservatives or other artificial ingredients, company executives said.

""We spend a lot of time with our kids at the grocery store. How can we possibly know if an armed person at a Kroger store is a responsible gun owner, or a serious threat to our children?"" said Shannon Watts, a former public relations executive who founded MDA. Watts said her group made its decision after gun rights supporters demonstrated at some of the company's stores. It also discovered that there had been shootings on Kroger properties over the years. Starbucks Corp had a gun policy similar to Kroger's up until 2013, when it became the target of both sides in the gun debate.

26,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, October 21 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a rating of 'BBB' to The  Kroger Co.'s (Kroger) $500 million issue of seven-year notes. The proceeds from  the issue will be used to repurchase commercial paper and for general corporate  purposes. The Rating Outlook is Stable. A full list of ratings is shown below.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Kroger's ratings are supported by its industry-leading sales growth and market  share gains and relatively stable operating margins balanced against ongoing  share repurchase activity and intense price competition.  Kroger generates industry-leading non-fuel identical store (ID) sales growth as  a result of strong pricing perception by customers, effective marketing through  use of loyalty card data, and improvements to the shopping experience. ID sales  growth of 4.7% in the first half of 2014 follows increases of 3.5% in 2013 and  3.5% in 2012, leading to market share gains in most of its major markets. The  company has achieved these results despite the weak consumer environment and  intense competition from discount and specialty formats. Fitch expects Kroger  will maintain low to mid-single digit ID sales growth over the next two to three  years.  Kroger has gradually managed down its gross margin ratio, and has offset this  pressure with cost containment efforts and the leveraging of fixed costs. The  EBIT margin was up slightly in 2012 and 2013, to 2.8% in the 12 months ended  Aug. 16, 2014, and is expected to be flat-to-slightly improved going forward.  Free cash flow (FCF) after dividends is expected to track around $500 million -  $600 million annually over the next three years, taking into account growth in  capital expenditures to the $2.8 billion - $3 billion range in 2014 (year ended  January 2015), and increasing by $200 million/year in subsequent years. Share  repurchases continue to be managed at a level that permits consistent financial  leverage.  The ratings take into account Kroger's merger with Harris Teeter Supermarkets,  Inc. (HTSI) in January 2014 for $2.4 billion (7.3x EBITDA), which was financed  with debt. Fitch views the addition of HTSI as neutral to moderately positive  from a business perspective, and that the risks associated with integrating HTSI  into Kroger's network are manageable.  Adjusted debt/EBITDAR increased from 2.6x prior to the acquisition (at Nov. 9,  2013), to a pro forma 3.1x at fiscal yearend (2/1/14), which is close to the  company's targeted range (net debt/EBITDA of 2.0x - 2.2x, which equates to  adjusted debt/EBITDAR of 3.0x - 3.2x).  Debt levels are expected to be steady in 2014 as the company manages leverage  down to its targeted range. Beyond 2014, management is expected to direct  essentially all of its free cash flow and potentially some incremental borrowing  to share repurchases in order to maintain adj. leverage at around 3.0x.  RATING SENSITIVITIES  A positive rating action would be considered if adjusted leverage improved to  the mid-2x range, together with steady mid-single-digit ID sales growth and  gradual margin improvement. This is not anticipated at this time.  A negative action would be considered if adjusted leverage moved up to the low  3x range due to pressure on margins and/or a more aggressive approach to share  repurchases or acquisitions. Fitch rates Kroger as follows:  --Long-term IDR 'BBB';  --Senior unsecured notes 'BBB'; --Bank credit facility 'BBB'; --Short-term IDR 'F2'; --Commercial paper 'F2'.  The Rating Outlook is Stable.

27,"   By Reid Spencer  Wallace wins Kroger 200 in tribute to ScottBy Reid SpencerNASCAR Wire ServiceDistributed by The Sports XchangeMARTINSVILLE, Va. -- Driving a No. 34 Kyle Busch Motorsports Toyota painted and numbered as a tribute to NASCAR Hall of Fame nominee Wendell Scott -- with Scott's family in attendance at Martinsville Speedway -- pole-sitter Darrell Wallace Jr. held off Timothy Peters to win the Kroger 200 NASCAR Camping World Truck Series race Saturday.Last year at Martinsville, driving the No. 54 KBM Tundra, Wallace became the first African-American driver to win a race in one of NASCAR's top three touring series since Scott accomplished the feat in what is now the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series on Dec. 1, 1963, at Speedway Park in Jacksonville, Fla.Though his number was changed to 34 on Saturday, in honor of Scott's traditional car number, the result was the same for Wallace, who grabbed the lead from Johnny Sauter in heavy traffic on Lap 188 of 200, moments before the record 11th caution slowed the race.Wallace pulled away after a restart with six laps left and beat Peters to the finish line by .495 second. Peters bumped Sauter out of the way in the closing laps, also opening the door for reigning series champion Matt Crafton, who came home third and extended his series lead to 18 points over fifth-place finisher Ryan Blaney.""I wasn't worried about anybody, honestly,"" Wallace said. ""They kept telling me where everybody was, and I said I didn't care. It's our weekend and we're going to come out and take this (grandfather) clock (trophy) home with us. And we just did that.""That was so fun. Martinsville is my favorite place to come to. Without the support of NASCAR and Toyota ... the whole Wendell Scott family is here and this is a special moment, just a perfect weekend for us. It's a true honor to have Wendell Scott on our Toyota Tundra and to be able to put it in Victory Lane. I know he (Scott) just said up there, 'Hell yeah.' This is cool.""Wallace said he appreciated the win even more than his first victory in the series, at Martinsville a year ago.""It means a lot. I know I had a guardian angel looking over me this weekend,"" said Wallace, who took over third place in the series standings, 22 points behind Crafton. ""To be able to put it in Victory Lane, you couldn't ask for a better weekend. You thought last year was special, but this definitely beats it.""Upset with what he deemed roughhouse tactics from Peters, Sauter attempted to confront the runner-up on pit road after the race, but NASCAR officials and crew members kept the drivers apart.""It's Martinsville,"" Peters said. ""If you're going to dish it out, you're going to need to be able to take it. Did I mean to run into him? Yeah. I'm not going to deny that -- maybe not as hard.""But it is what it is. I don't want to waste too much of my breath on that. We'll just focus on how well we ran today.""Wallace led 97 of the 200 laps. Second was the pace car, which was out front for a record 71 laps during a race that featured more rookies than veterans and six drivers competing in the series for the first time.Erik Jones ran fourth, followed by Blaney, Tyler Reddick, Sauter, Matt Tifft (a UNC-Charlotte freshman making his first start), Alex Guenette and German Quiroga, whose ill-fated attempt to take the lead in heavy traffic on Lap 188 caused his No. 77 Toyota to spin and brought out the 11th caution, solidifying Wallace in the lead.NASCAR Camping World Truck Series Race -- Kroger 200Martinsville SpeedwayMartinsville, Va. 1.

39,"   By Neha Dimri  Cerberus Capital is listing U.S. grocery store operator Albertsons Cos Inc a year after the private equity firm acquired Safeway and combined the two chains.Albertsons, the second-largest U.S. grocery chain after Kroger Co (KR.N), operates more than 2,200 supermarkets, including 1,247 Safeway stores.The company's other supermarket brands include Vons, Jewel-Osco, Shaw's, Tom Thumb and United Supermarkets.The IPO comes at a time when big grocery chains are getting squeezed by mass retailers such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) as well as upscale chains such as Whole Foods Market (WFM.O). Wal-Mart generated more than half its revenue from grocery sales last year.""Traditional supermarket chains are in a very challenging position and they need to enhance their differentiation, improve their competitiveness. They have a tough game to win,"" said Bob Goldin, an executive vice president at foodservice consultancy Technomic.Albertsons' revenue rose by more than a third to $27.2 billion for the 53 weeks ended Feb 28, but the company posted a net loss of $1.2 billion compared with a profit of $1.7 billion a year earlier. Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith are underwriting the IPO, the company said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The filing contained a nominal fund raising target of $100 million. Albertsons said it planned to use the proceeds from the offering to repay debt and for general corporate purposes. The amount of money a company says it plans to raise in its first IPO filings is used to calculate registration fees. The final size of the IPO could be different.The filing did not reveal how many shares the company planned to sell or the exchange on which it would list.

44,"  (Adds analysts' quotes, more background)By Lauren HirschOct 14 This year's largest initial public offering was priced at a discount, while the second's biggest was delayed, as payment processor First Data Corp and supermarket operator Albertsons Companies Inc faced a choppy market.Despite other companies, such as luxury department store operator Neiman Marcus Group Inc, delaying their listing, First Data and Albertsons had planned to press ahead with plans to price their IPOs on Wednesday. Investors have been giving most IPOs a cold reception since the stock market plunged in August.To go through with their IPOs, companies have had to discount them heavily to make them attractive to risk-averse investors. While some IPOs have proved to be good bargains based on how their shares have traded following their listing, the bruising experiences of many companies are expected to deter more IPO hopefuls in the near future. ""Since labor day, IPOs have priced on average 18 percent below the midpoint of their range, returning 16 percent for investors. In order to get those positive returns, prices are being slashed,"" said Kathleen Smith, a managing director at investment banking boutique Renaissance Capital LLC.Investors' reaction to First Data and Albertsons show that  more companies will likely hold back from launching IPOs or continue to discount them if they go ahead with them, Smith added.First Data, controlled by private equity firm KKR & Co LP , was hoping to raise as much as $3.7 billion. It raised $2.56 billion by selling 160 million shares at $16 per share, below its previously indicated $18 to $20 per share range. This gives the company a market capitalization of $14 billion and a value of $35 billion when debt is included. Albertsons, backed by buyout firm Cerberus Capital Management LP, decided to delay the pricing of its IPO. It was hoping to raise as much as $2 billion, but a disappointing Wal-Mart Stores Inc outlook on Wednesday weighed on investor sentiment and drove Albertsons peer Kroger Co's  shares down 3 percent on the day.Albertsons initially hoped the delay may last a day, but now sees it as unlikely that its IPO will price in the short term, at least not until markets become more favorable, according to one source familiar with the company's thinking who requested anonymity to discuss the deliberations. Albertsons did not respond to a request for comment. ""It is important to maintain momentum throughout the process. Companies that ride the momentum all the way usually get to the pricing they want,"" said Neil Dahr, who leads the capital markets practice group at PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP.First Data, Albertsons, and other private equity-owned companies have been keen to launch their IPOs so they can pay down some of the debt they were saddled with following their leveraged buyouts.Next week, Italian luxury carmaker Ferrari is scheduled to price its IPO in the United States in a range of between $48 and $52 per share, which could value the company at up to $9.8 billion.Earlier on Wednesday, mobile payments company Square Inc registered with U.S. regulators for its long-expected IPO, in a test of CEO Jack Dorsey's ability to take the company public even as grapples with a turnaround at Twitter Inc, which he also runs.

49,"  (Adds experts' comments, background on the industry)By Lauren HirschOct 15 The year's biggest initial public offering ended with a whimper on Thursday, highlighting companies' narrowing funding options as investors eschew risk.U.S. payment processing company First Data Corp, controlled by private equity firm KKR & Co LP, raised $2.56 billion in its stock market debut, a steep drop from the $3.7 billion originally targeted. Its shares ended down 1.6 percent.Almost two months after a stock market rout injected volatility and risk aversion into the IPO market, private equity firms and venture capital investors face tough pricing choices in raising money for their companies or cashing out on their stakes.Cerberus Capital Management LP, the private equity firm that controls supermarket operator Albertsons Companies Inc,  decided it would be better to wait. It pulled what was expected to be one of the largest IPOs of the year as it was about to price on Wednesday, and will not relaunch it until the markets become more favorable.To be sure, Albertsons also faced headwinds because of Wal-Mart Stores Inc, whose disappointing outlook weighed on investor sentiment and drove Albertsons peer Kroger Co's  shares down. ""We did successfully execute three IPOs in the last three weeks. So it is an environment where the markets are not closed, they are open from time to time for good companies,"" Michael Chae, chief financial officer of private equity firm Blackstone Group LP, told analysts on the company's third-quarter earnings call on Thursday.But the vast majority of companies that have gone ahead with their IPO since early September have had to discount or downsize their offerings and companies saddled with mountains of debt make investors nervous.Low interest rates have helped private equity firms to refinance their debt piles, easing pressure on them to take their companies public. But holding back from launching an IPO can also mean delaying returning money to private equity fund investors. Venture capital-backed companies valued at more than $3 billion may be under more pressure to go public, however, because they could find it difficult to raise further capital in the private markets while also meeting existing investors' valuation expectations.WHERE TO GET THE MONEY?  Companies launch IPOs for a number of reasons, including to pay down debt, or for their owners to cash out or raise funds  to grow the business. If the IPO market is inhospitable, there is no guarantee of a better reception in debt markets.Concordia Healthcare, for example, is relying more on the loan market to fund its $3.5 billion acquisition of Amdipharm Mercury (AMCo) after banks were unable to sell a high-yield bond that was intended to help finance the deal.The differentiator between companies in the IPO market is growth, experts say. Even mature companies that are looking to use proceeds to pay down debt can attract strong investor demand if they have promising prospects.Matt Harris, a managing director with Bain Capital Venture Partners LLC, contrasted First Data with Worldpay, a British payments processor that listed on the London Stock Exchange this week in an IPO valuing it at 4.8 billion pounds ($7.4 billion), the biggest flotation in London this year.""Worldpay is not a highly levered buyout. It represents a growth story,"" said Harris.

50,"  Supermarket operator Kroger Co (KR.N) said it would buy smaller chain Roundy's Inc RNDY.N for $800 million including debt to expand in Wisconsin and the Chicago area.The $3.60 per share cash offer represents a 65 percent premium to Roundy's Tuesday close of $2.18.The deal has an equity value of $177.8 million, based on Roundy's outstanding shares as of Aug. 3.Milwaukee-based Roundy's operates supermarkets under the Pick 'n Save, Copps and Metro Market and Mariano's banners, primarily in the upper Midwest.Roundy's shares rose to $3.58 in early trading on Wednesday. Kroger's shares were up slightly at $37.34.The deal will give Kroger 151 retail grocery stores and 101 pharmacies, for a total of 2,774 stores in 35 states.  The grocer will also gain presence in new markets such as Milwaukee, Madison and Northern Wisconsin and expand in the Chicago area, where it operates Ralphs and Food 4 Less stores.Telsey Advisory Group analyst Joseph Feldman said that at 6.8-7 times EBITDA it did not appear Kroger was overpaying.Kroger is facing increasing competition not only from traditional grocers such as Supervalu Inc (SVU.N) and Albertsons but is also losing sales to mass market chains such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) and Target Corp (TGT.N), which are expanding their grocery and fresh foods businesses. The company bought grocer Harris Teeter in 2013 to expand in the mid-Atlantic region, and last year it acquired health products retailer Vitacost.com Inc to expand in the fast-growing  health and wellness niche.Roundy's, which has not turned a profit in the past three quarters, generates about 65 percent of its sales in Wisconsin.The company, which reported third-quarter results on Wednesday, blamed store openings by competitors for a drop in same-store sales and weaker-than-expected revenue and profit. Kroger said it would finance the transaction with debt, and refinance Roundy's existing debt of $646 million.The grocer said it expects the deal to add slightly to earnings in the first year after closing, and sees costs savings of about $40 million over time.BofA Merrill Lynch and Sagent Advisors are financial advisers to Kroger, while J.P.

58,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, January 08 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a rating of 'BBB' to The  Kroger Co.'s (Kroger) multi-tranche $1.1 billion debt issuance. The notes rank  pari passu with existing debt and are being issued under Kroger's indenture  dated June 25, 1999.  Proceeds from the issuance will be used in part to  refinance the debt used to fund the acquisition of Roundy's, Inc., which closed  Dec. 18, 2015. The Rating Outlook is Stable. A full list of ratings is shown  below.   KEY RATING DRIVERS Industry-Leading ID Sales: Kroger generates industry-leading non-fuel identical  store (ID) sales growth, which has led to market share gains in most of its  major markets. Non-fuel ID sales have been positive for 12 consecutive years and  have accelerated in recent periods due mainly to an increase in customer visits.  ID sales increased 5.5% during the three quarters ended Nov. 7, 2015, after  rising 5.2% in 2014, 3.6% in 2013, and 3.5% in 2012.  Growth has been due to positive pricing perception by customers, effective  marketing through use of loyalty card data, and improvements to the shopping  experience. Fitch expects Kroger will maintain low- to mid-single-digit ID sales  growth of 3% - 4% over the next 24-36 months.  Relatively Stable-to-Improving EBIT Margins: After trending lower for several  years due to investments in price, Kroger's gross margin is currently  benefitting from the decline in fuel prices and reductions in transportation and  advertising costs.  Kroger has successfully offset long-term gross margin pressure with  cost-containment and the leveraging of fixed costs, enabling gradual EBIT margin  expansion from 2.8% in 2012 to 3.0% in 2014 and 3.2% for the first three  quarters of 2015. Fitch anticipates Kroger's EBIT margin could decline slightly  but remain above 3% following the acquisition of Roundy's, which had an EBIT  margin of 1.3% in 2014 and will require significant price investments to  increase competitiveness. Higher Capex to Support Growth: Kroger has stepped up its new store growth to  support its long-term earnings per share growth target of 8%-11%. Capex is  projected to slightly exceed $3.3 billion in 2015, up from $2.8 billion in 2014,  to support high-return projects and faster store growth in its existing and  high-potential markets for fill-in opportunities. Kroger expects to increase  capex by at least $200 million annually over the next several years, implying  capex could be north of $3.5 billion in 2016.  Cash Flow Usage, Healthy FCF: Kroger has utilized its cash to invest in its  business, repurchase shares, and to fund its dividend. Annual free cash flow  (FCF) is forecast to be approximately nearly $600 million in 2015 and roughly  $400 million in 2016 after taking into consideration increases in capex and  modest dividend growth. Kroger reviews its dividend yearly but the payout to net  income has been approximately20% in recent years.  Steady Leverage: Adjusted debt/EBITDAR declined to 2.6x at the LTM period ended  Nov. 7, 2015 from 3.3x at year-end 2013 (post the Harris Teeter Supermarkets,  Inc. acquisition). Leverage is expected to remain within the company's targeted  range of 2.0x - 2.2x net debt/EBITDA, which equates to adjusted debt/EBITDAR of  below 3.0x, following closure of the Roundy's acquisition. Debt reduction is not  anticipated as management is expected to direct essentially all its FCF after  dividends to share repurchases.  Scale, Diversity Are Benefits: Kroger benefits from its position as the largest  supermarket retailer in the nation, its geographic diversity, and its multiple  store formats which provide convenience to its customers. Kroger generates over  $100 billion of revenue, and operated 2,625 supermarket and multidepartment  stores, 782 convenience stores, and 326 jewelry stores across 49 major markets  in 2014. The company generally holds the No. 1 or No. 2 position in those  markets. Kroger has a significant fuel business, and manufactures about 40% of  the private-label products sold in its stores. Corporate brands represent about  25% of total units sold, excluding fuel and pharmacy.  KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case for Kroger include: --Low-single-digit organic revenue growth in 2015, due mainly to lower retail  fuel prices, and then mid-single-digit growth thereafter driven primarily by  supermarket ID sales.  The acquisition of Roundy's is expected to add about $4  billion of annual revenue,  or a 4% contribution, in 2016.  --Non-fuel ID sales approximating 5% in 2015 and 3.5% - 4% annually thereafter.  --EBIT margin remains above 3% over the next several years, even after the  acquisition of Roundy's, as cost reduction efforts help fund investments in  price. EBITDA margin remains above 5%.   --FCF (post dividends) of nearly $600 million in 2015 and roughly $400 million  in 2016, reflecting increases in capex and modest dividend growth.  --Net debt/EBITDA remains within management's targeted 2.0x - 2.2x range,  approximating adjusted debt/EBITDAR of 3.0x throughout the forecast period with  debt increasing and proceeds used for share repurchases or tuck-in acquisitions. RATING SENSITIVITIES A positive rating action would be considered if adjusted leverage improved to  the mid-2x range, together with steady mid-single-digit ID sales growth and  gradual margin improvement. This is not anticipated at this time.  A negative action would be considered if adjusted leverage moved up to the low  3x range due to pressure on margins and/or a more aggressive approach to share  repurchases or acquisitions. LIQUIDITY Kroger had approximately $2.6 billion of liquidity at Nov. 7, 2015, of which  approximately $1.2 billion was cash and the remainder was availability on the  firm's $2.75 billion revolver. Ongoing liquidity is supported by the company's  FCF, which Fitch projects will be approximately $400 million in 2016. Kroger's  revolving credit facility expires in June 2019 and supports commercial paper  (CP) borrowings and letters of credit (LCs). The revolver subjects Kroger to a  maximum net debt/EBITDA financial maintenance covenant of 3.5x. The company's  2.0x - 2.2x leverage target results in significant covenant cushion. Kroger had  no outstanding borrowings on its revolver but had $1.4 billion of CP and $13  million of LCs under the credit facility at Nov. 7, 2015. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch currently rates Kroger as follows:  --Long-term IDR 'BBB';  --Senior unsecured notes 'BBB'; --Bank credit facility 'BBB'; --Short-term IDR 'F2'; --Commercial paper 'F2'.

59,"   By Lisa Baertlein and Sruthi Ramakrishnan  Kroger Co (KR.N) and Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O) both turned in softer-than-expected sales at established stores on Thursday, stoking worries about deflation and U.S. consumer spending.Kroger, which attributed some of the weakness to unusually mild winter weather, warned that lower inflation would cool same-store sales growth this year, sending shares down 7.9 percent to $37.46 in afternoon trading. The timing of this year's Super Bowl also hit sales, executives said.  While shoppers have more disposable income as a result of significantly lower fuel prices, ""economic uncertainty remains, which typically causes people to cut back on discretionary spending,"" Kroger Chief Executive Rodney McMullen said on a conference call with analysts.   The largest supermarket operator in the United States said sales at established stores, referred to as same-store sales, rose 3.7 percent in the quarter, excluding fuel, missing the 4.5 percent rise analysts expected, according to research firm Consensus Metrix.Kroger, owner of the Ralphs, Smith's and Food 4 Less stores, forecast same-store sales growth of 2.5 percent to 3.5 percent for the year ending January 2017, down from 5 percent growth for year earlier. Costco said its same-store sales growth was hurt by lower traffic in January and a strong dollar that dented overseas spending on big-ticket items. Shares in Costco were down 2.1 percent at $149.65.Excluding fuel and foreign exchange impact, same-store sales at Costco rose 5 percent, below the 5.4 percent growth expected by analysts polled by research firm Consensus Metrix.February traffic was up just over 3.5 percent, while the average transaction fell about 3.75 percent, Costco executives said on a call with analysts. Kroger Chief Financial Officer Mike Schlotman conceded that  volatile prices for staples such as meat, milk and produce are giving certainty-seeking investors heartburn. Still, he warned against concluding that ""less inflation is fundamentally a bad thing.""For example, he said, same-store sales in Kroger's meat department were down 5 percent in the latest quarter. But steep price declines lured back shoppers who had been suffering from sticker shock and the resulting increase in tonnage contributed to Kroger margins.            ""The price of meat went down and the volume went a up lot, which is a sign of a solid, normal consumer environment,"" said BB&T Capital Markets analyst Andrew Wolf. The average value of the dollar against a basket of currencies was 8.2 percent higher in Costco's second quarter compared with the same quarter last year. The company gets about 27 percent of its revenue from outside the United States.Sales at rival Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) missed market expectations last month, hurt by a strong dollar, declining prices for grocery products and sluggish apparel demand.

61,"  (Corrects to show that Kroger profit did not miss Wall Street view, first paragraph)LOS ANGELES, March 3 Kroger Co and Costco Wholesale Corp both turned in softer-than-expected sales at established stores, stoking worries about deflation and U.S. consumer spending.Kroger, which attributed some of the weakness to unseasonably warm weather, warned that same-store sales growth would cool this fiscal year because of lower inflation, sending shares down 9 percent to $36.99 in midday trading.The largest grocery operator in the United States said identical supermarket sales, excluding fuel, rose 3.7 percent in the quarter - less than the 4.5 percent rise analysts expected, according to research firm Consensus Metrix.Kroger forecast identical supermarket sales growth of 2.5 percent to 3.5 percent for the year ending January 2017, down from 5 percent growth for year earlier.

The timing of this year's Super Bowl also hit sales, executives said.Net income attributable to Kroger was $559 million, or 57 cents per share. Analysts, on average, had expected earnings of 54 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Costco said its same-store sales growth was hurt by lower traffic in January and a strong dollar. Shares in Costco were down 2.1 percent at $149.65.Excluding fuel and foreign exchange impact, same store sales rose 5 percent, below the 5.4 percent growth expected by analysts polled by research firm Consensus Metrix. The average value of the dollar against a basket of currencies was 8.2 percent higher in Costco's second quarter compared with the same quarter last year. The company gets about 27 percent of its revenue from outside the United States.""Costco's traffic trend has turned more volatile in recent months, especially since the first gas price-induced step up that started in August 2014 and a subsequent step down. In addition, Costco has faced incremental deflation,"" JP Morgan analyst Christopher Horvers wrote in a pre-earnings note.Net income attributable to Costco fell to $546 million, or $1.24 per share, missing analysts' call or a profit of $1.28 per share.Sales at rival Wal-Mart Stores Inc missed market expectations last month, hurt by a strong dollar, declining prices for grocery products and sluggish apparel demand.

74,"   By Lisa Baertlein   (This version of the May 25 story corrects paragraph eight to show that Trader Joe's sells produce by piece and package, not by the pound)By Lisa BaertleinLOS ANGELES Whole Foods Market Inc (WFM.O) unveils its new 365 grocery chain on Wednesday with a bright and airy store that offers lower prices and more technology than the company's namesake shops. To thrive, though, experts say 365 has to beat its many rivals without hijacking customers from Whole Foods itself.The chain, which debuts in Los Angeles' Silver Lake neighborhood, is critical to Whole Foods. In the fiercely competitive market for fresh fruit and vegetables, its sales are being whittled away by Sprouts Farmers Market Inc (SFM.O) and other rivals who are undercutting Whole Foods on price, if not always matching it on quality.Low prices are the top demand even among shoppers prioritizing goods promoting health and wellness, said Richard Vitaro of market research firm AlixPartners. ""I don't think we can underestimate the power of frugality,"" said Vitaro.From the start, 365 has targeted reduced overheads and increased customer convenience, said Jeff Turnas, president of the chain. Whole Foods said recently it has signed 19 leases for 365 stores around the United States, without disclosing financial targets for the new chain.""Our goal is to compete in the marketplace without lowering the Whole Foods standards,"" Turnas told Reuters during a recent store tour. He said 365 stores will complement Whole Foods' premium, full-service sister brand - often dubbed 'Whole Paycheck' in popular culture in reference to its perceived higher prices.  But the new chain will have to work hard to avoid being labeled ""a cheaper Whole Foods"", said Kevin Kelley, a principal at strategy and design firm Shook Kelley, which has worked with Whole Foods and other grocers. AIR GUITARS, FOODIES 365's messaging is breezier than its serious elder sibling's. One sign offers ""Free air guitars"", while a ""Silver Kale"" mural next to the meat case is a fun, foodie nod to the chain's first neighborhood, known for a hipster feel. About half of the brightly colored fruits and vegetables at 365 are non-organic, a greater proportion than at Whole Foods. Produce is priced per piece or per package, as at cult discounter Trader Joe's, rather than by the pound.365 stores will be about a third smaller than the average Whole Foods outlet, and carry roughly a quarter the number of products - reducing real estate and merchandise-related costs.Staffing is leaner and no longer specialized. An iPad app replaces wine experts, while meat, cheese and fish are in ""grab-and-go"" packages - meaning no butchers or cheese and fishmongers.    While 365 takes aim at budget gourmets and cash-strapped ""millennial moms"", grocery experts said it also needs to appeal to people who buy from a range of other food sellers, from Kroger (KR.N) and Walmart (WMT.N) to Amazon.com (AMZN.O), restaurant delivery companies and meal kit providers such as Blue Apron. Some are skeptical that 365 stores will hit the mark. ""I don't see them generating the efficiency they need to balance value and quality,"" said Bill Bishop of retail consultancy Brick Meets Click. Shook Kelley principal Kevin Kelley disagreed: ""Whole Foods gets culture,"" he said, and has the experience to successfully choose what goes on the shelves in smaller 365 stores.Roger Davidson, a consultant who has held key positions at chains such as Wild Oats, which was acquired by Whole Foods, Walmart and Texas grocer H-E-B, is betting on 365 succeeding. But amid intensive competition in the sector, Davidson said 365 has little room for error. ""They have to make it work,"" he said.

Net income attributable to Kroger rose about 10 percent to $680 million, or 70 cents per share, in the first quarter.

102,"   By Gayathree Ganesan  Kroger Co (KR.N), the biggest U.S. supermarket chain, tempered its forecasts for the remainder of the year amid pressure from falling food prices and intense competition from grocery sellers  ranging from Wal-Mart (WMT.N) to Amazon (AMZN.O).Cincinnati, Ohio-based Kroger said it now expects this fiscal year's adjusted per share profit to be $2.10 to $2.15, down from its prior forecast of $2.10 to $2.20.Shares in the company, whose supermarket brands also include Ralphs and Fred Meyer, were up 0.9 percent to $32.58 in midday trading after that revised forecast essentially matched analysts' estimate of $2.13 per share for the fiscal year that ends Jan. 30, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Kroger, known as one of the supermarket industry's best operators, reported slightly better-than-expected third-quarter revenue, profit in line with Wall Street expectations, and marketshare gains. Nevertheless, its challenges continue.""Persistent and increasing deflation"" is expected to weigh on store sales in the fourth quarter, Chief Financial Officer Michael Schlotman said on a conference call with analyst. Food prices in the United States have been deflating due to low oil and grain prices. The food-at-home consumer price index for the third quarter was 1.9 percent lower than a year ago with milk, eggs, beef, veal, pork and poultry posting the largest declines. (bit.ly/2gYNp15)Most grocers are passing those lower prices on to shoppers and restaurants, which have been raising menu prices to offset higher labor costs. Kroger's net income attributable to the company fell to $391 million, or 41 cents per share, in the third quarter ended Nov. 5, from $428 million, or 43 cents per share, a year earlier.Excluding certain items, the company earned 41 cents per share, matching analysts' estimate. Net sales rose 5.9 percent to $26.56 billion. Analysts on average had expected $26.34 billion. Kroger, whose stock has lost more than a fifth of its value this year, said it expects the current operating environment to continue in the first half of 2017.""The extent to which the grocery market has shifted from an environment of modest inflation to one of deflation and tough price competition is evident in Kroger's numbers,"" said Neil Saunders, chief executive of research firm Conlumino.As a result, Saunders expected the company to keep a lid on costs in the coming quarters.
