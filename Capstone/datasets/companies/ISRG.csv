1,"   By Bill Berkrot  Intuitive Surgical Inc (ISRG.O) on Thursday said it expects to sell fewer of its high-priced da Vinci surgical robot systems in 2014 than last year and diverged from past practice by not providing a revenue forecast for the year.The company said it would issue a revenue forecast later in the year when it has a clearer view of business trends, such as da Vinci use for benign gynecology surgeries, which has been slowing in the United States, and whether it secures reimbursements for procedures in Japan in addition to prostate surgeries.Intuitive said it expects da Vinci procedure growth this year of 9 percent to 12 percent, down from 16 percent in 2013. Procedures grew by about 12 percent in the fourth quarter of 2013.Intuitive Surgical shares fell 4.5 percent to $419.33 in extended trading, from a Nasdaq close at $439. Intuitive, which had experienced double-digit revenue growth and steadily rising da Vinci sales in past years, saw those trends hit a wall in 2013 in part due to media reports questioning the cost effectiveness of using the robots for certain procedures, capital spending uncertainty by hospitals, and physicians holding off on recommending prostate surgery for slower-progressing cancers.As a result, the company missed out on the big 2013 stock rally; its shares were one of the worst performers in healthcare, falling about 21 percent for the year.The company on Thursday said its growth in general surgeries and improved business outside the United States was partially offsetting declines in U.S. prostate procedures, once the bread and butter for the company. ""For 2014, we are focused on expanding use of da Vinci in general surgery, particularly colorectal surgery and single-incision surgery, supporting worldwide gynecology and urology growth, broadening our stapling and Single-Site launches, and continuing to strengthen our capabilities in international markets, particularly Europe and Japan,"" Intuitive Chief Executive Gary Guthart said.Intuitive reported fourth-quarter profit that easily exceeded diminished Wall Street expectations, despite another steep decline in da Vinci sales. Results were helped by a lower tax rate and operating cost reduction. Net profit fell to $166 million, or $4.28 per share, from a profit of $175 million, or $4.25 per share a year ago. Analysts' on average were looking for earnings of $3.83 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Intuitive earlier this month at an investor conference pre-announced its sales results for the quarter. Da Vinci sales fell 23 percent to $205 million as the company sold 138 systems compared with 175 a year ago. It was an improvement over the third quarter, however, when 101 of the $1.5 million da Vinci systems were sold.The company, on a conference call with analysts, said it expected to sell more of its less expensive da Vinci systems in 2014, further contributing to revenue uncertainty.(Reporting by Bill Berkrot; Editing by Bernard Orr and Leslie Adler)",2014-01-23,ISRG,"Thu Jan 23, 2014 | 6:07pm EST",Intuitive Surgical sees fewer da Vinci robot sales in 2014,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-intuitive-results-idUSBREA0M23120140123?type=companyNews

Intuitive, which had experienced double-digit revenue growth and steadily rising da Vinci sales in past years, saw those trends hit a wall in 2013 in part due to media reports questioning the cost effectiveness of using the robots for certain procedures, capital spending uncertainty by hospitals, and physicians holding off on recommending prostate surgery for slower-progressing cancers.In the fourth quarter of 2013, systems sales witnessed a 23 percent decline to $205 million.Intuitive Surgical said it expects revenue of $465 million for the first quarter. Analysts on average were expecting sales of $537.9 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The medical device maker reported revenue of $611 million a year earlier.Revenue from da Vinci Surgical Systems fell nearly 59 percent to about $106 million in the first quarter of 2014, Intuitive said on Tuesday.The device maker sold 87 systems in the quarter, compared to 164 a year earlier. U.S. sales fell to 45 from 115. The company cited lower procedural volumes, the implementation of the Affordable Care Act and expectations of a new version of the robot system for lower U.S. shipments.The company said the revenue estimate included a $26 million deferral related to trade-in of da Vinci 'Si' systems for the upgraded version.Intuitive Surgical said it would also record a $67 million pre-tax charge to reflect estimated costs of settling a number of claims related to its surgical robot system.The company's shares closed at $489.84 on the Nasdaq.(Reporting by Natalie Grover in Bangalore; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila and Cynthia Osterman)",2014-04-09,ISRG,"Tue Apr 8, 2014 | 8:02pm EDT",Intuitive Surgical expects revenue below estimates as da Vinci sales fall,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-intuitivesurgical-results-preliminary-idUSBREA3727K20140409?type=companyNews

First-quarter net income, including a $67 million charge for settling legal claims related to its surgical robotic system, was $44 million, or $1.13 a share, compared with $189 million, or $4.56 a share, in the same period a year ago.

32,"   By Lewis Krauskopf | NEW YORK  NEW YORK In a beaten-up stock market, Intuitive Surgical Inc (ISRG.O) stands out as the best-performing large-cap U.S. healthcare stock that is not an acquisition target.Shares of Intuitive, which boasts a dominant position in surgical robotic systems, have climbed 13 percent over six months. Over the same period, the Standard & Poor's healthcare sector index .SPXHC has slid 13 percent, and the only stock in the index to top Intuitive's performance was Baxalta Inc BXLT.N, which recently agreed to be acquired for $32 billion by Shire Plc (SHP.L) [nL8N14V2FI]. Intuitive's signature product, the $1.5 million da Vinci robotic system used in gynecological and prostate surgeries, has been used in more procedures and the company has seen improving profit margins, said RBC Capital Markets analyst Brandon Henry.""They’re kind of clicking on all cylinders"" in recent quarters, he said. A test for the stock's momentum could come after the market closes on Thursday, when the $20 billion market-cap company reports fourth-quarter results. The Sunnyvale, California, company has already announced that it expects a 12 percent increase in fourth-quarter revenue, which topped analysts' views, and expects procedures using the da Vinci system to rise about 9 percent to 12 percent in 2016.

37,"  (Repeats story published on Jan 20, no changes)By Lewis KrauskopfNEW YORK Jan 20 In a beaten-up stock market, Intuitive Surgical Inc stands out as the best-performing large-cap U.S. healthcare stock that is not an acquisition target.Shares of Intuitive, which boasts a dominant position in surgical robotic systems, have climbed 13 percent over six months. Over the same period, the Standard & Poor's healthcare sector index has slid 13 percent, and the only stock in the index to top Intuitive's performance was Baxalta Inc , which recently agreed to be acquired for $32 billion by Shire Plc.Intuitive's signature product, the $1.5 million da Vinci robotic system used in gynecological and prostate surgeries, has been used in more procedures and the company has seen improving profit margins, said RBC Capital Markets analyst Brandon Henry.""They're kind of clicking on all cylinders"" in recent quarters, he said.A test for the stock's momentum could come after the market closes on Thursday, when the $20 billion market-cap company reports fourth-quarter results. The Sunnyvale, California, company has already announced that it expects a 12 percent increase in fourth-quarter revenue, which topped analysts' views, and expects procedures using the da Vinci system to rise about 9 percent to 12 percent in 2016.

46,"   By Susan Kelly | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Even though many doctors see need for improvement, surgical robots are poised for big gains in operating rooms around the world.Within five years, one in three U.S. surgeries - more than double current levels – is expected to be performed with robotic systems, with surgeons sitting at computer consoles guiding mechanical arms. Companies developing new robots also plan to expand their use in India, China and other emerging markets.Robotic surgery has been long dominated by pioneer Intuitive Surgical Inc, which has more than 3,600 of its da Vinci machines in hospitals worldwide and said last week the number of procedures that used them jumped by 16 percent in the second quarter compared to a year earlier.The anticipated future growth - and perceived weaknesses of the current generation of robots - is attracting deep-pocketed rivals, including Medtronic Inc and a startup backed by Johnson & Johnson and Google. Developers of the next wave aim to make the robots less expensive, more nimble and capable of performing more types of procedures, company executives and surgeons told Reuters.Although surgical robots run an average of $1.5 million and entail ongoing maintenance expenses, insurers pay no more for surgeries that utilize the systems than for other types of minimally-invasive procedures, such as laparoscopy.  Still, most top U.S. hospitals for cancer treatment, urology, gynecology and gastroenterology have made the investment. The robots are featured prominently in hospital marketing campaigns aimed at attracting patients, and new doctors are routinely trained in their use.Surgical robots are used in hernia repair, bariatric surgery, hysterectomies and the vast majority of prostate removals in the United States, according to Intuitive Surgical data.Doctors say they reduce fatigue and give them greater precision.But robot-assisted surgery can take more of the surgeon's time than traditional procedures, reducing the number of operations doctors can perform. That's turned off some like Dr. Helmuth Billy.  Billy was an early adopter of Intuitive's da Vinci system 15 years ago. But equipping its arms with instruments slowed him down. He rarely uses it now.""I like to do five operations a day,"" Billy said. ""If I have to constantly dock and undock da Vinci, it becomes cumbersome.""     SURGEONS' WISH LIST To gain an edge, new robots will need to outperform laparoscopic surgery, said Dr. Dmitry Oleynikov, who heads a robotics task force for the Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons. Surgeons told Reuters they want robots to provide a way to feel the body's tissue remotely, called haptic sensing, and better camera image quality.New systems also will need to be priced low enough to entice hospitals and outpatient surgical centers that have not yet invested in a da Vinci, as well as convince those with established robotic programs to consider a second vendor or switching suppliers altogether.""That is where competitors can differentiate,"" said Vik Srinivasan of the Advisory Board Co, a research and consulting firm that advises hospitals.Developers say they are paying attention. Verb Surgical, the J&J-Google venture that is investing about $250 million in its project, said creating a faster and easier-to-use system is a priority.  Verb also envisions a system that is ""always there, always on,"" enabling the surgeon to use the robot for parts of a procedure as needed, said Chief Executive Scott Huennekens.Intuitive said it too is looking to improve technology at a reasonable cost, but newcomers will face the same challenges.""As competitors come in, they are going to have to work within that same framework,"" CEO Gary Guthart said in an interview.Device maker Medtronic has said it expects to launch its surgical robot before mid-2018 and will start in India.

Analysts on average expected $5.14  per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.     Overall revenue for the quarter rose about 16 percent to $683 million, topping analyst expectations for sales of $650.5 million.
