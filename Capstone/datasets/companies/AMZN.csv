9,"  By Peter GumbelJan 10 France has kicked off 2014 with an array of skirmishes against Amazon, Google and other U.S. Internet companies, in what is shaping up as a classic battle between comfortable Gallic tradition and disruptive modernity.On Thursday, Jan. 9, the French Senate unanimously approved a bill that would ban Amazon from offering free shipping on books in France. Strongly endorsed by the Ministry of Culture, the legislation is supposed to safeguard the existence of the country's 3,500 bookstores, about 800 of which are independent.A few hours earlier, France's national agency for data protection, known by its acronym CNIL, announced that its sanctions committee had found Google to be in breach of national privacy laws, based on the company's March 2012 decision to merge different privacy policies for each of its services - including YouTube, Gmail, Google Maps and Google Docs - into one policy. CNIL, along with data protection agencies in five other EU nations, argued that Google doesn't sufficiently inform its users about how or why their data is processed. It ordered the Internet giant to pay a fine of 150,000 euros (about $200,000) and to publish a communiqué on its French home page informing users of the sanction.And in late December, a handful of companies offering private minicab services online in France, including the San Francisco-based startup Uber, began organizing against a new government decree that forces minicabs to wait 15 minutes before picking up a customer, unlike regular taxis that have no such restriction. While the circumstances differ in the three cases, they together reveal a France that can be slow, reluctant and sometimes downright ornery about accepting the sort of changes that the digital age brings. French officialdom pays lip service to the importance of innovation - there's even a government minister charged with fostering it - but the government can be vigorous when it comes to defending the French way of doing things. Netflix, which is available in other parts of Europe, hasn't yet been able to launch its services in France, and last year a government minister prevented Yahoo from buying the French video site Dailymotion. Culture is an especially sensitive topic. France provides big subsidies to TV shows, movies and even newspapers, and insists that its ""cultural exception"" is exempted from any new European free trade deal with the U.S., in order to be able to continue paying subsidies and imposing quotas on the proportion of U.S. shows on French television.Industry groups have a far stronger voice than consumers, and the regular licensed taxis, and even the bookstores, are no exception. Last January, the nation's 55,000 taxis staged a series of road blockages protesting the arrival of new cab services like Uber, and the 15-minute wait period is one result of their action. The national bookstore association decried Amazon for using ""dumping"" prices - and persuaded the government to give booksellers an additional $25 million in subsidies.A third characteristic is that consumers' interests are at times sacrificed for a perceived common good. European Union legislation bans most monopolies these days, but oligopolistic practices are common. Under a law dating back to 1981, for example, bookstores are not allowed to offer discounts of more than 5 percent on the retail price of books set by the publisher. That's great for authors, publishers and bookstores, but an anomaly at a time when books are quickly discounted in price elsewhere. And despite the ability of consumers to buy around the clock online, the government hasn't yielded to public pressure to allow stores to stay open on Sundays or late in the evenings. Competition - a source of innovation and low prices, but a threat to the status quo - is frowned upon. France's national antitrust authority came out strongly against the 15-minute rule for online cabs, saying it would introduce ""unjustified distortions to competition."" The two government ministries that issued the decree, the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Trade, ignored its advice.The big question is whether any of these attempts to crack down on the Internet firms and their methods will have an impact. This is not just a French issue: Amazon and Google are also being targeted by regulators in other European nations, including the UK, Germany, Spain and Italy. The European Union has been investigating alleged anti-competitive actions by Google for the past three years, and several countries have expressed dismay at the relatively small amounts of tax that Google and Amazon pay to their national treasuries, largely as a result of smart financial engineering and use of transfer payment loopholes in European corporate accounting.In Google's case, the 150,000 euro fine levied is an all-time record for the French data protection agency, but a mere slap on the wrist for the Internet giant, whose worldwide daily revenues are about 1,000 times as large. And the alleged lack of privacy protection hasn't stopped the onward march of Google's services in France. Former President Jacques Chirac in 2006 tried to create a Franco-German search engine called Quaero to compete with the U.S. giant, spending $130 million of government money on the effort, which has gone nowhere; Google today has more than 90 percent of the French search engine traffic. The new law aimed at Amazon also seems unlikely to stop or slow the growing trend of online book buying in France and the demise of bookstores. About 17 percent of books in France are now sold online, compared with about just 3 percent in 2005, according to the Ministry of Culture. Four out of every five of those online sales goes through Amazon. The profit margins of bookstores, long wafer-thin, have all but vanished. In 2011-12, according to official figures, bookstore profit margins were just 0.3 percent of their revenue on average. (For Amazon, profitability is an afterthought. Its stock continues to soar as it loses money.)The proposed ban on free shipping must still receive final approval from the lower house of parliament before it goes on the books, but that seems probable given the broad bipartisan support it has received. Once it is enacted, Amazon and its online competitors will have to choose between offering less expensive shipping or less expensive books. The total discount won't be able to exceed 5 percent - ensuring that books bought online will be more expensive than those bought in stores.As for the taxis and their 15-minute grace period, the government decree has been widely chided, and not just by the online cab firms. Jacques Attali, an influential former government adviser and writer who proposed a full liberalization of the taxi system in France several years ago, described it as ""absurd."" Uber, together with other online cab services, plans to lodge a formal complaint against the decree in French administrative courts. But their advantage over regular cabs won't come through court decisions; it will come because their services are easier, more convenient, often cheaper, and simply more modern than conventional cabs. And however much France likes to intervene to keep the status quo, it's a losing battle.It's also detrimental to France as a whole. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, among others, frequently reproaches France for over-regulating its product markets, arguing that the restrictions on competition ""not only reduce productivity growth but also hinder the development of employment.""The French answer to that is usually a Gallic shrug. France moves at its own pace, even in a frenetic digital world.",2014-01-10,AMZN,"Fri Jan 10, 2014 | 5:06pm EST",COLUMN-France says 'Non' to the digital age,http://www.reuters.com//article/gumbel-france-idUSL2N0KK2J120140110?type=companyNews
10,"  FRANKFURT Jan 10 Roman Catholic Church-owned bookseller Weltbild, which competes with online retailer Amazon.com in Germany, filed for insolvency on Friday after its sales shrank and it unexpectedly found itself unable to obtain fresh financing.Unlisted Weltbild, which has 6,800 employees, has been posting losses as it invests in a shift to more internet-based business.The company, which relies on catalogue sales and is part owner of Germany's second biggest brick-and-mortar bookstore chain, has struggled to keep up with Amazon and its sales fell in the second half of 2013.""The lower level of sales expected for the next three years as well doubles the amount of financing needed until the company is restructured,"" it said in a statement.It said its business was to continue while the court-appointed insolvency administrator works out a plan to restructure the business. Weltbild's insolvency filing, made with a court in the southern German city of Augsburg, does not affect the bookstores, Weltbild's businesses in Austria and Switzerland or its website buecher.de.As recently as September, Weltbild denied that its financial future was uncertain, saying its management did not see the company's survival as being at risk. But earlier on Friday, Handelsblatt Online said that the Roman Catholic groups that own the publisher had failed to agree on fresh financing.The owners of Weltbild - 12 Catholic dioceses, the Association of German Dioceses and the church's soldiers' welfare organisation - have fought for years over their strategy for the company. Two years ago, they even decided to prepare a sale of the for-profit business after accusations that Weltbild was making profits from selling erotic books, but no deal materialised.Weltbild in 2012 generated sales of almost 1.6 billion euros ($2.1 billion) with mail-order sales of books and household items and from its part-owned bookstore chain Hugendubel.Hugendubel is in turn part of Germany's No. 2 bookstore group after Thalia, which is owned by beauty-to-books retailer Douglas.Amazon's online book sales alone in Germany bring in about the same amount as Weltbild's entire revenue, giving it a share of almost 75 percent of Germany's online book retailing market.",2014-01-10,AMZN,"Fri Jan 10, 2014 | 12:47pm EST",Catholic Church-owned German bookseller Weltbild files for insolvency,http://www.reuters.com//article/germany-weltbild-idUSL6N0KK1BA20140110?type=companyNews

13,"   By Paulo Prada  NOVA ESPERANÇA DO PIRIÁ, Brazil Alex Lacerda and Paulo Maués drive a silver pickup to an outdoor sawmill near the edge of the Amazon rainforest. Carrying 12-gauge shotguns, they step out and approach a shack, knock and enter cautiously. They are agents for Brazil's environmental police.A stocky man identifies himself as João Pereira, owner. The agents ask him for two documents: an operating license for the sawmill and a certificate of origin for the lumber stacked outside. ""I have the license,"" Pereira says. ""My accountant has the other.""Wrong answer. The logs outside lack identification tags required on legally cut wood. And Pereira, like all sawmill owners, is required by law to keep permits on site.""He's stalling,"" says Lacerda. ""There's no reason not to have the paperwork - you're either operating legally or not.""Pereira's sawmill is one of hundreds like it on the contracting fringe of the world's largest rainforest. Unlicensed mills are part of a gray economy that has come to define development in the Amazon. The activity spans everything from precious hardwoods to illegally extracted minerals to the bare land left behind, itself a commodity for ranchers and squatters who speculate on its future value.In late September, Reuters accompanied agents from the Brazilian Institute for the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources, or Ibama, for the start of a month-long sting against people felling the rainforest. Charged with enforcing the country's environmental laws, Ibama agents see firsthand the destruction. Many who live here consider the cutting a local right. Environmentalists and scientists, because the rainforest acts as a greenhouse-gas filter, say the activity cripples the fight against climate change.During the operation, Ibama shut eight sawmills and leveled another nine, demolishing unlicensed facilities whose operators had skipped town - a common tactic when Ibama is nearby. The agents levied more than $1.7 million in fines, seized machinery and confiscated roughly $2 million worth of lumber. Most of that wood came from a nearby Indian reserve, a swath of virgin forest that, like much of Brazil's protected woodland, is increasingly besieged.After a decade on the retreat, deforestation in the Amazon is on the rise again.The people who profit from deforestation are emboldened by changing environmental legislation, government-sponsored Amazon infrastructure projects and high global prices for soy, beef and other products farmed on cleared woodland. And the methods that in recent years curbed the destruction, culminating in record-low deforestation in 2012, have lost some of their edge.Now that satellites can detect large forest clearings, loggers cut smaller patches. Stricter licensing now organizes the market for legal lumber, but loggers and millers flout rules and forge permits. Ranchers, waiting for new forestry rules to be fully implemented, exploit the uncertainty to clear land.GUARD DOWN ""Brazil let its guard down,"" says Paulo Barreto, a forestry engineer at Imazon, a research institute that studies deforestation from Belém, capital of the state where Ibama conducted the raids. ""There is growing incentive to clear land, and the government isn't keeping up.""The result: a spike in deforestation. Using satellites, Brazil's space agency over the past year detected new clearings totaling 2,256 square miles (5843 square kilometers), up nearly 30 percent from 2012. That's more than seven times the area of New York City.Brazilian officials, including President Dilma Rousseff, tout the success of policies that have reduced deforestation, even after the recent increase, to less than a fifth the area lost in 2004. Back then, woodland the size of Belgium fell. In September, Environment Minister Izabella Teixeira flew to New York and accepted a United Nations award for ""reversing deforestation.""The government and its allies say the deforestation spike suggests an equilibrium has been reached - a minimum level of destruction beyond which future progress comes slowly. ""We must expect some annual fluctuations,"" says Tine Sundtoft, environment minister for Norway, which in 2008 pledged as much as $1 billion to help Brazil fight deforestation through 2015.Brazilian officials say continued progress depends on greater awareness, education and deterrence. ""Society must change,"" says Francisco Oliveira, director of policies against deforestation at Brazil's environment ministry. ""Everyone in the Amazon must understand there are real consequences for breaking the law.""To deliver the message, Brazil is redoubling law enforcement. That means a growing number of raids by Ibama.The agency has been in flux since a 2011 law gave more environmental enforcement to local authorities. Ibama closed most of the far-flung offices it once operated. Its 1200 agents increasingly focus on reconnaissance, intelligence and data analysis - efforts then used to deploy teams to flashpoints.""We can't be everywhere,"" says Luciano Evaristo, Ibama's director of environmental protection. ""We must be smarter and more agile to combat deforestation where it's most intense.""Their tally of fines and confiscations is on the rise. In the year from August 2012 through July 2013, Ibama levied fines of about $830 million and seized almost 86,000 cubic meters of lumber in the Amazon. The year prior, the totals were $700 million and 54,000 cubic meters of wood.LAWLESS JUNGLE OUTPOSTS Leading the raids are officials like Lacerda and Maués. They are the top two Ibama inspectors in Pará, a state bigger than Texas and California combined. Known for lawless jungle outposts, Pará accounted for nearly half the past year's devastation.At 4 a.m. on the first day of their mission, Maués is at a police station on the outskirts of Belém, briefing 16 Ibama agents and a team of 10 state police officers who will accompany them for added security. Until now, none but the senior agents know their destination - a five-hour drive east to one of the most unruly corners of Brazil.Maués reminds them of dangers in an area rife with clashes between loggers, miners, Indian tribes and lawmen. In 2008, after receiving death threats over raids he was leading, Maués fled a field office Ibama operated nearby. Loggers soon burned it to the ground. The raids, more than six months in the planning, will center around Nova Esperança do Piriá, or New Hope on the Piriá, one of dozens of rivers that slice across Pará. Settled in the 1970s, Nova Esperança, population 20,000, is a frontier town with a ramshackle center and a sparsely peopled bush beyond.When satellites early last year showed increased clearings nearby, Ibama agents examined registries for licensed wood companies. Plainclothes inspectors scoured the region, and Ibama began to liaise with state police and Brazil's army.In April, the army deployed a jungle unit to Nova Esperança for a brief ""social and civic"" mission, says Lt. Col. Jucenílio Evangelista da Silva, commander of the unit. As Army dentists, doctors and barbers pulled teeth and gave free checkups and trims, the troops reconnoitered.Now, as Maués gives his pre-dawn briefing, 104 of Evangelista's troops are back, setting up a makeshift camp, kitchen and communications center. Local officials, grateful for the April visit, had given the colonel permission to use an unfinished schoolhouse for ""an operation.""Evangelista hadn't specified the target: the sawmills, the sole private industry in a town where 98 percent of the municipal budget is financed by federal revenue. ""That needed to stay a surprise,"" he says.THE STING There is space for legitimate logging in the Amazon. Eighty percent of the original rainforest still stands, covering a region the size of Western Europe. And know-how and legislation exist to foster a sustainable forestry industry. Legal concessions dictate what types of trees can be cut and how dense forest must remain around logging.Ibama learned, however, that the wood passing through Nova Esperança was of species that remain only inside the Alto Guamá Indigenous Reserve, a 1,000-square-mile area that is home to the nearby Tembé tribe. The woods - species like jatobá, maçaranduba, and andiroba - are prized for flooring, furniture and construction. They can be legal if extracted from managed forests.But the Tembé reserve is protected, one of the few patches of primary forest left in the eastern Amazon. Less than 100 miles south lie woods that are home to the Awá tribe, some of whom are among the last uncontacted Indians in Brazil.""There's a mosaic of forest that must be preserved so that people, animals and plants don't get cornered into unsustainable areas,"" says Lacerda, a biologist by training.Maués wraps up his briefing. The agents and officers pile into six silver pickups with king cabins. The sun rising, their convoy progresses from the crowded four-lane highway outside Belém, to potholed rural routes, to the red dirt road into Nova Esperança.Around noon, they arrive, driving along dusty streets where shops sell chainsaws and logging equipment. One home nearby uses long, discarded sawblades for fence rails, teeth upward. The trucks turn onto a road at the far end of town. There, a string of seven sawmills has been carving up trees.The agents descend and push open the gate to the first mill: the Maranata wood company. No one is inside its office. A desk and cabinets are empty. A long shelter where the sawing takes place is vacant. A toolshed is bare, and a fresh hole in the floor marks where a big machine has been yanked out. ""They knew we were coming,"" Maués says.Outside, locals admit as much: Workers, seeing the army arrive, spent the night dismantling some of the mills and stashing lumber, machinery and documents in the woods.The lumberjacks, the bottom rung of the industry, are hiding, too. Loggers make as little as $15 per cubic meter of wood. But the lumber, when finished, sells for at least 30 times that, often multiples more.LOST LIVELIHOOD Next door, at the Piriá wood company, a middle-aged couple have stuck around. Maués and Lacerda walk over, dwarfed by heaps of timber. The couple sit calmly.Like the logs at João Pereira's sawmill, none of the trunks here have identity tags. And like Pereira, the owners say they possess the required documents, but that their lawyer, based in Belém, currently has them.""You better call him,"" Lacerda says.The woman, Rosa Maria da Silva Santos, complies.By now, scores of locals have gathered along the fence. Many scream at the agents. Some weep.""This is how people eat around here,"" says Alves Borges de Nascimento, a 35-year-old millworker. ""How come the government has resources to come shut us down, but not give us alternatives?""That evening, soldiers ladle out beans and rice at the schoolhouse. Troops stand guard with machine guns outside.Santos' lawyer and a timber consultant arrive. They have the operating license and documents for some of the wood. But it doesn't satisfy questions about all 840 cubic meters in her lumberyard. The tags that were supposed to be on the trunks, says the consultant, ""could have fallen off.""""That might happen on one or two of the logs,"" says Maués, ""but not all.""The next morning, the agents head into the backwoods.They drive through farms and past humpback cattle grazing on land cleared years ago. Some of it was once public, hence protected. But poor demarcation, forged deeds and lax enforcement mean squatter's rights prevail.Although ranchers sometimes preserve woodland, many are now cutting as Brazil races to roll out a digitally mapped registry of its more than 5 million known farms. The registry will help track what's public, what's private and whether new clearings are legal, the government says. In the meantime, landowners are rushing to get ahead of the mapping, expected to take years.By midday, the agents drive through the Tembé reserve.""THEY COULD HAVE KILLED ME"" Two years ago, a group of 35 Tembé confronted five lumberjacks felling reserve trees. The Tembé, wielding shotguns and machetes, forced them from their land and burned two logging tractors.In November 2012, Ibama agents joined Valdecí Tembé, a tribe leader, to investigate another incursion. This time, the loggers formed an armed posse to confront them. The standoff ended peacefully, but Valdecí was so rattled that he darted into the jungle and wandered alone for days.""They could have killed me,"" he says.On this afternoon, the agents pull into João Pereira's lumberyard. The police frisk Pereira's workers and search the mill for weapons.""You won't find any,"" says Pereira, 58. ""I never got anywhere with a gun.""Lacerda orders him to summon the accountant with the documents for his 404 cubic meters of wood. Maués, meanwhile, authorizes a buyer with a waiting semi-truck, loaded with $7,000 worth of freshly sawn tauarí, to haul the boards to a warehouse. The buyer may spray the wood for fungi, Maués says, but he can't sell it until Ibama clears its origin.On the drive back to camp, the agents come upon three workers erecting a sawmill shed. They have already laid tracks for a cart that will ferry logs across the sawblades. These rudimentary sawmills can be built with equipment costing as little as $10,000. There are hundreds in the Amazon and thousands across Brazil, Ibama agents say.""Is there a license for this?"" agent Gunther Barbosa asks the builders.""I don't know,"" answers one, eyeing Barbosa's gun nervously.""You tell whoever sent you to build this that you are going to stop,"" Barbosa says. ""If we come back and this is still standing, we are going to take chainsaws to it.""Over the next days and weeks, the agents begin demolishing sawmills with no permits, including the one being built near Pereira's. They fine Santos and her husband $290,000 for faulty paperwork and possessing illegal wood. They fine Pereira $149,000 for the same violations. They order both mills shut until the paperwork clears.Some of the locals absent at the start of the sting emerge, including Dejair Nunes, owner of Maranata, the vacant sawmill from the first day. The agents find his equipment, seize it and fine him $930,000 for no license and for storing illegal wood.Sipping a Coke at his girlfriend's house, Nunes, 31, scoffs at the charges.His disdain illustrates a handicap for Ibama: It often can't collect on the fines. Many get appealed or outright ignored. Compared with the $830 million in fines it levied in the Amazon, Ibama in 2012 reported fine revenues nationwide of only about $34 million.The agency can target the assets of those fined and block their credit, but many find ways to keep sawing. They use new names, move or just restart when Ibama leaves.""What I do might be illegal,"" says Nunes, ""but it's not immoral.""(Edited by Michael Williams)",2014-01-16,AMZN,"Thu Jan 16, 2014 | 9:53am EST",Special Report: Rainforest raiders foil the guardians of the Amazon,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-brazil-deforest-special-report-idUSBREA0F0RU20140116?type=companyNews
14,"  (For more Reuters Special Reports, double-click on )By Paulo PradaNOVA ESPERANÇA DO PIRIÁ, Brazil, Jan 16 Alex Lacerda and Paulo Maués drive a silver pickup to an outdoor sawmill near the edge of the Amazon rainforest. Carrying 12-gauge shotguns, they step out and approach a shack, knock and enter cautiously. They are agents for Brazil's environmental police.A stocky man identifies himself as João Pereira, owner. The agents ask him for two documents: an operating license for the sawmill and a certificate of origin for the lumber stacked outside. ""I have the license,"" Pereira says. ""My accountant has the other.""Wrong answer. The logs outside lack identification tags required on legally cut wood. And Pereira, like all sawmill owners, is required by law to keep permits on site.""He's stalling,"" says Lacerda. ""There's no reason not to have the paperwork - you're either operating legally or not.""Pereira's sawmill is one of hundreds like it on the contracting fringe of the world's largest rainforest. Unlicensed mills are part of a gray economy that has come to define development in the Amazon. The activity spans everything from precious hardwoods to illegally extracted minerals to the bare land left behind, itself a commodity for ranchers and squatters who speculate on its future value.In late September, Reuters accompanied agents from the Brazilian Institute for the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources, or Ibama, for the start of a month-long sting against people felling the rainforest. Charged with enforcing the country's environmental laws, Ibama agents see firsthand the destruction. Many who live here consider the cutting a local right. Environmentalists and scientists, because the rainforest acts as a greenhouse-gas filter, say the activity cripples the fight against climate change.During the operation, Ibama shut eight sawmills and leveled another nine, demolishing unlicensed facilities whose operators had skipped town - a common tactic when Ibama is nearby. The agents levied more than $1.7 million in fines, seized machinery and confiscated roughly $2 million worth of lumber. Most of that wood came from a nearby Indian reserve, a swath of virgin forest that, like much of Brazil's protected woodland, is increasingly besieged.After a decade on the retreat, deforestation in the Amazon is on the rise again.The people who profit from deforestation are emboldened by changing environmental legislation, government-sponsored Amazon infrastructure projects and high global prices for soy, beef and other products farmed on cleared woodland. And the methods that in recent years curbed the destruction, culminating in record-low deforestation in 2012, have lost some of their edge.Now that satellites can detect large forest clearings, loggers cut smaller patches. Stricter licensing now organizes the market for legal lumber, but loggers and millers flout rules and forge permits. Ranchers, waiting for new forestry rules to be fully implemented, exploit the uncertainty to clear land.GUARD DOWN ""Brazil let its guard down,"" says Paulo Barreto, a forestry engineer at Imazon, a research institute that studies deforestation from Belém, capital of the state where Ibama conducted the raids.

This represents a great opportunity for retailers by providing a new, capital-light approach to grow rapidly,""  OC&C partner Anita Balchandani said in a statement. Britain, the most advanced e-commerce market in the world, generated the biggest online trade surplus in 2013 of more than $1 billion, OC&C estimated, followed by the United States with a surplus of $180 million and Germany on $35 million.While OC&C said U.S. online pioneers eBay and Amazon were the top international players in pure e-commerce, German online fashion retailer Zalando and British rival ASOS were next in their ranking. ASOS said on Jan. 14 that retail sales rose 38 percent to 335.7 million pounds in the four months to Dec. 31, helped by a jump of 69 percent in Europe even as growth in the United States and Australia slowed.Swedish furniture retailer IKEA topped the OC&C ranking of traditional players using e-commerce to speed their international expansion, followed by fashion retailer H&M  and U.S. cosmetics seller Avon Products Inc.German sportswear maker Adidas led the OC&C ranking of brands which have used e-commerce to build their international standing, followed by France's Louis Vuitton  and Hermes, and Britain's Burberry.",2014-01-20,AMZN,"Mon Jan 20, 2014 | 6:29am EST",Online cross-border trade seen growing fivefold by 2020-study,http://www.reuters.com//article/retail-online-idUSL5N0KU1BY20140120?type=companyNews
18,"   By Liana B. Baker and Ronald Grover  Verizon Communications Inc's acquisition of Intel Corp's venture to create a web-based TV service may be the catalyst that pushes U.S. cable players to start similar products to fend off fast-growing video rivals such as Netflix Inc and Amazon.com Inc.The deal, announced on Tuesday, came two weeks after Sony Corp revealed it was working on its own cable-like video service and makes it likely that Internet-delivered TV services may be getting closer after attempts from Apple Inc and other technology companies.Amazon has also considering an online TV service, and has been talking with content owners about licensing TV networks, according to the Wall Street Journal.Verizon said it acquired Intel Corp's OnCue service for an undisclosed sum to accelerate its push into next-generation video services, including integrating it with its FiOS product, the fiber-based Internet and TV offering that has 5.3 million video subscribers, about 5 percent of pay TV households.In a more ambitious move, Verizon also says it intends to deliver ""over the top to any device,"" which almost certainly would kick off a race to capture eyeballs that will force cable operators to offer standalone services outside their service territories.""For Verizon this could be an opportunity for them to offer a triple play to subscribers in the rest of the country,"" said Blair Westlake, who until recently headed Microsoft Corp's media and entertainment group. ""If you're a Comcast that may get you thinking that it's time to start offering video in other markets as well.""Verizon has the brand, marketing dollars and customer relationships to make it a viable threat to cable operators, said UBS analyst John Hodulik.There is a likely market waiting for it as well. North American consumers will spend $6 billion in 2014 on entertainment from over-the-top services such as Netflix, more than twice what they spent in 2010, according to PwC's annual entertainment and media forecast. Cable TV operators, meanwhile, are losing video subscribers to satellite and telecom operators, according to SNL Kagan, putting pressure on their operating margins due to rising programming costs.CABLE WARS If Verizon's move prompts a similar bid from cable companies, it would upset a decades-long balance in the cable TV industry, which operates in near monopoly status with markets carefully carved up by local governments. Customers could choose between Comcast and Time Warner Cable for their video service, or Verizon for that matter.Comcast may be furthest along with a potential over-the-top service with its Xfinity X1 platform, which allows a subscriber to its traditional video service to toggle between live and on-demand programming with a slick interface. A Comcast spokeswoman said the company is focused on getting that product released across its markets and not on an ""over-the-top"" service.""If Comcast really launches one, it starts a war between all the different cable companies that are already incumbents,"" said BTIG analyst Rich Greenfield. ""That probably means they fight over price, service and features that are great for the consumer.""It won't be easy for a new entrant to get started, however. Content owners so far have not granted cable operators the digital rights to sell their shows outside their markets.That has not stopped both cable and satellite companies from eyeing the opportunity. Both Time Warner Cable Inc and satellite operator DirecTV bid on Hulu - the video streaming site owned by Walt Disney Co's ABC network, Comcast's NBCUniversal and Fox parent Twenty-First Century Fox Inc. Hulu's owners, the major content companies, decided instead to invest in it rather than sell it. Charter, which has made a bid to buy No. 2 cable provider Time Warner Cable, has openly floated the idea. ""We may sell subscriptions everywhere,"" Charter Chief Executive Officer Tom Rutledge said in an November conference call, responding to a question about Charter's streaming TV application.Cable's competitors aren't sitting idle. DirecTV CEO Mike White has said the No. 1 satellite operator is working on an ""over-the-top"" video package to suit niche audiences, such as Hispanic or kids programming. DirecTV's rival Dish Network Corp is also eyeing the online opportunity.""We're thinking of over the top too,"" Dish CEO Joe Clayton said on the sidelines of the Consumer Electronics Show in early January.Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson research, is skeptical that online video newcomers such as Sony can be profitable enough to take on the incumbents. When folks start using huge amounts of bandwidth for TV viewing, he predicts Internet bills will jump as providers start charging by usage.""A virtual provider like Sony could be left with a me-too service,"" Moffett says, ""and an even higher total cost to the end user than the Pay TV subscription they would be hoping to replace.""For some cable operators, this could mean opportunity emerging from the chaos. Cablevision Systems Corp CEO James Dolan, for one, has said he sees a future in which cable operators no longer use their wires to offer video service and instead just offer broadband Internet, which makes more money.(Reporting by Liana B.

It also marked the first time that the S&P 500 ended January with a loss since 2010, when the benchmark index started the year with a drop of 3.7 percent.In Friday's session, energy and consumer discretionary shares had the biggest declines of the day after some disappointing earnings.

The VIX shot up 6.5 percent to end Friday's session at 18.41. For January, the VIX jumped 34 percent, its biggest monthly gain since May 2012.

For the week, the Dow fell 1.1 percent, the S&P 500 dipped 0.4 percent and the Nasdaq slipped 0.6 percent.A selloff in emerging market currencies spurred some central banks to raise interest rates or intervene in markets to limit the swings, but investors worry it may not be enough to reverse the trend. The Fed's removal of stimulus added to the concerns because the extra liquidity has helped many of those markets.Weighing on investor sentiment was data showing that inflation in the euro zone slowed this month to 0.7 percent from 0.8 percent in December. That reading confounded expectations for an increase to 0.9 percent and matched a low hit last October. The European Central Bank responded by cutting its interest rates to record lows. Among the day's biggest decliners was Amazon.com, which fell 11 percent to close at $358.69, a day after the world's biggest online retailer missed Wall Street's estimates for the crucial holiday period. Amazon also cautioned investors about a possible operating loss this quarter as shipping costs climb.Chevron's shares dropped 4.1 percent to end at $111.63, their worst daily percentage decline since October 2012, after the second-largest U.S. oil company said its fourth-quarter profit dropped 32 percent as refining margins and production fell around the world.On the plus side, Google Inc's (GOOG.O) shares added 4 percent to close at $1,180.97 after the Internet search giant reported quarterly revenue that beat Wall Street's target despite an ongoing decline in prices for its online ads and deepening losses at Motorola, the handset-making division to be sold to China's Lenovo (0992.HK).Zynga Inc (ZNGA.O) shares jumped 23.6 percent to $4.40, after the video game maker, known for its ""Farmville"" game, said late Thursday that it will cut 15 percent of its workforce.Volume was higher than the average for the month.

40,"   By Lisa Richwine | LOS ANGELES  LOS ANGELES Feb 6 Amazon.com Inc  released its second batch of TV pilots on Thursday and asked for customer feedback to help determine which of the 10 shows to develop into series for its video streaming service.The company is investing in original content to attract customers to its $79-a-year Amazon Prime service, which competes for online viewers with services such as Netflix and Hulu.com. Prime also includes free two-day shipping for Amazon products.The new pilots include three comedies and two dramas for adults, plus five children's shows. Amazon will make a decision on how many to put into development after customers have their say by leaving online comments and ratings.Malcolm McDowell stars in the comedy ""Mozart in the Jungle,"" a story about ""sex, drugs -- and classical music,"" an Amazon statement said. A science-fiction show, ""The After,"" was written and directed by ""The X-Files"" creator Chris Carter.Amazon chose the pilots after looking at the genres that are popular with its customers, said Roy Price, director of Amazon Studios.

44,"   By Lunae Parracho and Caroline Stauffer | JACAREACANGA, Brazil  JACAREACANGA, Brazil As Brazil struggles to solve land disputes between Indians and farmers on the expanding frontier of its agricultural heartland, more tensions over forest and mineral resources are brewing in the remote Amazon.The government of President Dilma Rousseff gave eviction notices to hundreds of non-Indian families in the Awá-Guajá reserve in Maranhão state in January and plans to relocate them by April, with the help of the army if necessary, Indian affairs agency Funai says.The court order to clear the Awá territory follows the forced removal of some 7,000 soy farmers and cattle ranchers from the Marãiwatsédé Xavante reservation last year, a process profiled by Reuters that resulted in violent clashes.Anthropologists say evictions from Awá territory could be even more complicated. It is thought to be a base for criminal logging operations and is also home to some indigenous families who have never had contact with outsiders, a combination that worries human rights groups lobbying for the evictions.The government missed a federal judge's deadline to start carrying out the evictions last year but began ordering them after a high-profile campaign backed by the likes of actor Colin Firth.Now, other tribes from the Amazon as well as the long-settled soy belt are lobbying to have non-Indians removed from their lands or have new reservations created at the same time Rousseff's leftist government, faced with a sputtering economy in an election year, is trying to build dams, expand farmland and otherwise spur growth.South America's largest country is still grappling with unresolved indigenous land issues more than a century after the United States finished carving out Indian reservations and has become one of the world's clearest examples of the conflict between preserving indigenous culture and promoting economic development.""The Indians are showing ever increasing persistence in asserting their rights, which will likely increase conflicts with outsiders interested in their lands,"" said Rubem Almeida, a Brazilian anthropologist.The federal government says it is strictly following the law and is taking pains to relocate non-Indian settlers when it removes them from indigenous territories. Each conflict is unique and requires a different approach, said Paulo Maldos, a senior presidential aide who works on social policy.""The only thing they have in common is the constitution, which says we must demarcate Indian territory and that land titles inside indigenous land are null,"" he said. ""The Indians know where their lands are and are never going to stop trying to return to them; they have a very special relationship with the land.""TRIBE TAKES ON WILDCAT MINERS Take the Munduruku tribe in western Pará, a vast Amazon state that stretches to Brazil's coast and is more than twice the size of France.Their more than 2 million-hectare (4.9 million-acre) slice of protected rain forest is being encroached on by efforts to dam the Tapajós river, build new roads for exporting soy and corn crops, and especially by wildcat miners in search of gold.The tribe's leaders, who refer to themselves as warriors, traveled to the capital Brasilia last year to demand that the federal government remove non-indigenous miners from their territory.Rather than wait for a court decision to start the process, which took years for the Xavante and Awá, the Munduruku decided to take matters into their own hands and expel the wildcat miners in January. Miners operating without government licenses independent of large companies are common in both the Brazilian and Peruvian Amazon. They are known for using high levels of mercury that pollute local water sources.A group of 70 Munduruku were about to dismantle a fifth wildcat mine by sneaking up on the outposts on boats they said were supplied by Funai when Reuters visited them in mid-January. Armed with bows and arrows, they outnumbered the miners and were able to take over without anyone being hurt - this time.The Munduruku have not yet decided what to do with the mining equipment they confiscated.""The machinery will be idle for a month,"" Chief Paigomuyatpu Manhuary said. ""After that, the people will decide whether we close the mine or work the ones in places where the jungle has already been cleared, for the benefit of the community.""Tribal leaders also plan to resist the construction of the Teles Pires and Tapajós hydroelectric dams in Mato Grosso and Pará states. They have previously joined other tribes in protesting Belo Monte, which will be the world's third-largest dam and flood large swaths of the Amazon once complete. The government says indigenous groups are consulted before energy projects that affect them are built, in accordance with international law.HIRED HIT MEN The Munduruku are sometimes called upon to do heavy labor for the miners, known as garimpeiros, in exchange for food, a small amount of gold or small sums of money, tribe members told Reuters. They also fear they may already be the targets of hired hit men.Indians across Brazil say non-indigenous presence in their territories threatens their safety and unique culture, both of which are supposedly protected in the constitution. The farm lobby in Congress wants to amend the constitution to limit the amount of land that can be reserved for indigenous people.The constitution, written in 1988 shortly after Brazil emerged from a military dictatorship, enshrined the Indians' right to ""the lands they traditionally occupy,"" and said the state is responsible for ""demarcating them, protecting and ensuring respect of their property.""The Munduruku's fears echo those of the Guarani-Kaiowá Indians 2,000 km (1,240 miles) away in Mato Grosso do Sul state. They say they often receive death threats from ranchers and that they have been denied access to their ancestral territory, which is also occupied by sugar cane plantations.The cattle ranchers have argued that they must protect private property from invading Indians who claim the land as ancestral. In Mato Grosso do Sul, many ranchers have legitimate titles on lands that overlap with Indian territory. The government has said it is trying to buy some of the properties at the center of the conflict.Last month, a local court ordered private security firm Gaspem to be shut done on the grounds it was really a front for hit men hired by ranchers to kill Indians. Public prosecutors called Gaspem a ""heavily armed group of brutal vigilantes.""

46,"   By Jeremy Wagstaff  Asian chat services KakaoTalk, LINE and WeChat threaten to overturn the mobile order of things, usurping the role of Google Inc, Apple Inc, Amazon.com Inc, Facebook Inc and telecoms carriers as gatekeeper to the consumer.Where these internet and telecoms giants once controlled the lucrative choke points of the industry, social messaging services are fast emerging as an alternative distribution channel for adverts, apps, and goods and services.For example, Tencent Holdings' WeChat allows its more than 270 million active users to book taxis, top up phone credit, and even invest in wealth management products, while Naver Corp's LINE recently launched flash sales via its app in Thailand, with more than 5 million users signing up to buy L'Oreal lipstick and other products.The growing role of such apps as distribution channels was acknowledged by Japanese billionaire Hiroshi Mikitani when he explained why his company Rakuten Inc bought messaging company Viber last week for $900 million. ""In some smaller emerging markets, it was very difficult for Rakuten to go in because of the lack of scale or distribution infrastructure. But after the acquisition of Viber we can now go into those markets with our digital businesses.""MAKING MONEY At the heart of the battle is how to make money from the world's billions of mobile phone users.Traditionally, it was carriers who took in the revenue from voice and SMS messages - and more recently from internet usage. Income, however, has been hurt by so-called over-the-top players such as Google and Facebook, who make most of their money from advertising.Then there are the app stores, where users find and download apps. Although many of these are free, users are encouraged to add features which they pay for within the application. Google's Play store and Apple's App Store, the two largest, deliver these apps and handle all payments, taking a 30 percent cut along the way, some of which they may split with the carrier. In some countries, other app stores dominate, particularly China, where Google doesn't operate its online store.These platforms are not only a source of revenue, but also effectively control access to the end-user. Apple said users spent $10 billion on its App Store last year.But the growing popularity of mobile messaging apps is changing this.More than half of all smartphone users are active users of such apps, according to Analysys Mason, and the volume of messages has already overtaken traditional SMS short messages, and will double again this year.Riding this wave are dozens of companies peddling mobile messaging apps, with some able to gather a critical mass of 100 million users or more. By offering compelling mixes of chat, downloadable icons and games, LINE, KakaoTalk and WeChat have emerged as some of the most popular in Asia. Now these apps are leveraging their networks to become gatekeepers of their own. Take South Korea, for example. In Google's app store there seven of the top-10 grossing apps are Kakao-branded, according to App Annie, a company that measures app usage. Kakao promotes them to users of its apps and takes a cut from the developer. While Google and the carriers get their 30 percent, Kakao takes another 21 percent. With KakaoTalk on around nine of every 10 South Korean smartphones, it's an easy, albeit costly, way for game developers to be noticed.WeChat, or ""Weixin"" in China, meanwhile, has taken its home market by storm, and Shenzhen-based Tencent is throwing itself into monetizing the app, going well beyond selling users emoticons - called stickers - and extra lives for games and into e-commerce and banking.When WeChat let users send traditional Chinese New Year gifts of money through their smartphones, a survey by market research firm Ebrun this month found it had been key in users adopting WeChat's payment service: 74 percent of users surveyed had connected their bank account to their WeChat profile.""This is really exciting,"" says Bertrand Schmitt, Beijing-based CEO of App Annie.

47,"   By Jeremy Wagstaff  Feb 19 Asian chat services KakaoTalk, LINE and WeChat threaten to overturn the mobile order of things, usurping the role of Google Inc, Apple Inc, Amazon.com Inc, Facebook Inc and telecoms carriers as gatekeeper to the consumer.Where these internet and telecoms giants once controlled the lucrative choke points of the industry, social messaging services are fast emerging as an alternative distribution channel for adverts, apps, and goods and services.For example, Tencent Holdings' WeChat allows its more than 270 million active users to book taxis, top up phone credit, and even invest in wealth management products, while Naver Corp's LINE recently launched flash sales via its app in Thailand, with more than 5 million users signing up to buy L'Oreal lipstick and other products.The growing role of such apps as distribution channels was acknowledged by Japanese billionaire Hiroshi Mikitani when he explained why his company Rakuten Inc bought messaging company Viber last week for $900 million. ""In some smaller emerging markets, it was very difficult for Rakuten to go in because of the lack of scale or distribution infrastructure. But after the acquisition of Viber we can now go into those markets with our digital businesses.""MAKING MONEY At the heart of the battle is how to make money from the world's billions of mobile phone users.Traditionally, it was carriers who took in the revenue from voice and SMS messages - and more recently from internet usage. Income, however, has been hurt by so-called over-the-top players such as Google and Facebook, who make most of their money from advertising.Then there are the app stores, where users find and download apps. Although many of these are free, users are encouraged to add features which they pay for within the application. Google's Play store and Apple's App Store, the two largest, deliver these apps and handle all payments, taking a 30 percent cut along the way, some of which they may split with the carrier. In some countries, other app stores dominate, particularly China, where Google doesn't operate its online store.These platforms are not only a source of revenue, but also effectively control access to the end-user. Apple said users spent $10 billion on its App Store last year.But the growing popularity of mobile messaging apps is changing this.More than half of all smartphone users are active users of such apps, according to Analysys Mason, and the volume of messages has already overtaken traditional SMS short messages, and will double again this year. Riding this wave are dozens of companies peddling mobile messaging apps, with some able to gather a critical mass of 100 million users or more. By offering compelling mixes of chat, downloadable icons and games, LINE, KakaoTalk and WeChat have emerged as some of the most popular in Asia. Now these apps are leveraging their networks to become gatekeepers of their own.Take South Korea, for example. In Google's app store there seven of the top-10 grossing apps are Kakao-branded, according to App Annie, a company that measures app usage. Kakao promotes them to users of its apps and takes a cut from the developer. While Google and the carriers get their 30 percent, Kakao takes another 21 percent. With KakaoTalk on around nine of every 10 South Korean smartphones, it's an easy, albeit costly, way for game developers to be noticed.WeChat, or ""Weixin"" in China, meanwhile, has taken its home market by storm, and Shenzhen-based Tencent is throwing itself into monetising the app, going well beyond selling users emoticons - called stickers - and extra lives for games and into e-commerce and banking.When WeChat let users send traditional Chinese New Year gifts of money through their smartphones, a survey by market research firm Ebrun this month found it had been key in users adopting WeChat's payment service: 74 percent of users surveyed had connected their bank account to their WeChat profile.""This is really exciting,"" says Bertrand Schmitt, Beijing-based CEO of App Annie. ""It's like building a new platform on top of platforms.""BIG AT HOME, BUT ...  To be sure, none of these companies is about to seriously challenge the big players.

50,"  By Alina SelyukhWASHINGTON Feb 19 U.S. federal regulators will once again try to set rules that make sure broadband providers do not block or slow access to content on the Internet, or charge content providers like Netflix or Amazon  for faster Web service.The Federal Communications Commission's plan for new so-called ""Net neutrality"" rules comes a month after a U.S. court struck down their previous iteration, which was the second court's rejection of the rules.The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in January said the FCC, in adopting the 2010 open Internet order, improperly treated Internet service providers as regulated public utilities providing telecommunications services, like telephone companies, while they were actually classified as information service providers.But the court did affirm that the FCC had authority to regulate broadband as it oversees its expansion and competitiveness of services, giving the agency new legal opportunity to bring back non-discrimination and no-blocking regulations for Internet service providers.FCC commissioners will now negotiate a new version of the rules that would ensure that network operators disclose exactly how they manage Internet traffic and that they do not restrict consumers' ability to surf the Web or use applications.Virtually all large Internet service providers, in the wake of January's ruling, pledged to continue abiding by the principles of open Internet. But consumer advocates worry that without properly reclassifying broadband providers, the FCC leaves the door open for backdoor deals that would give unequal treatment to websites or services. Though the FCC did not move to begin the reclassification, Wheeler said the option to remained on the table.New rules are likely to be finished in the late spring or early summer, a senior official said, as the FCC takes on the review of a proposed merger between the two biggest U.S. cable and broadband providers, Comcast Corp and Time Warner Cable Inc.Though Comcast is bound by an earlier agreement to abide by the FCC's net neutrality rules until 2018, and has reiterated its commitment, the size of the merger has rekindled concerns about what future agreements between content and Internet providers may mean for open Internet.Verizon Communications Inc, which challenged the FCC's rules in court, arguing they violated the company's right to free speech and stripped control of what its networks transmit and how, is not expected to appeal. Company spokesman Ed McFadden on Wednesday said Verizon remained committed to providing consumers ""with competitive choices and unblocked access to lawful websites and content when, where, and how they want.""BATTLE LINES The issue of Net neutrality rules has drawn political battle lines in Washington as many Republicans have sided with Verizon's argument that it amounted to government overreach, referring to the rules as ""a solution in search of a problem."" ""The Internet was free and open before the FCC adopted Net neutrality rules. It remains free and open today,"" said FCC Commissioner Ajit Pai, the senior of the two Republicans on the five-member commission. ""I am skeptical that this effort will end any differently from the last.""Democratic telecom leaders in Congress welcomed the FCC's move on Wednesday, after California Representatives Anna Eshoo and Henry Waxman introduced a bill that would reinstate the open Internet order that the FCC approved in late 2010.But consumer groups Free Press and Public Knowledge expressed disappointment that the FCC was did not take a tougher stance for reclassification of broadband providers to give the agency more oversight power.An online citizen petition to the White House calling for such a reclassification collected 105,572 signatures, prompting a response from the Obama administration .""Absent Net neutrality, the Internet could turn into a high-priced private toll road that would be inaccessible to the next generation of visionaries,"" White House officials responded on Tuesday, deferring to the FCC on the matter.Reclassification would face a tremendous pushback from the broadband industry, and Republican leaders in Congress on Wednesday called on the FCC to tread lightly.""No matter how many times the court says 'No,' the Obama administration refuses to abandon its furious pursuit of these harmful policies to put government in charge of the Web,"" said House Commerce Committee Chairman Fred Upton and Communications and Technology Subcommittee Chairman Greg Walden.",2014-02-19,AMZN,"Wed Feb 19, 2014 | 2:32pm EST",UPDATE 3-U.S. telecom regulator will write new 'Open Internet' rules,http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-fcc-internet-idUSL2N0LO19920140219?type=companyNews
51,"  By Jane WardellSYDNEY Feb 23 The world's top economies agreed on Sunday to develop stricter rules on cross-border taxation to close loopholes that have allowed multinationals such as Starbucks Corp, Google Inc, Apple Inc  and Amazon.com Inc to avoid paying taxes.The Group of 20 endorsed a set of common standards for sharing bank account information across borders with automatic exchange of information among its members to take effect by the end of 2015.""Some multinational companies aren't paying their fair share of tax anywhere,"" Australian Finance Minister Joe Hockey, who hosted the meeting of G20 finance ministers and central bankers in Sydney, said at the close of the gathering. ""We want a global response.""Reports of profit shifting by companies away from high tax countries to more relaxed tax regimes have sparked public inquiries in the United States and Britain.Global tax evasion could be costing more than $3 trillion a year according to researchers from Tax Justice Network, while as much as $32 trillion - twice the size of U.S. gross domestic product - could be stashed away in tax havens.Tightening tax loopholes has gained urgency in the aftermath of the global financial crisis when developed nations' efforts to avert economic meltdown left them with gaping budget holes and record debt. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has targeted fiscal consolidation as a key part of its growth strategy for the G20, but that will be hard to achieve if tax bases are eroded further.Corporate tax evasion is also a challenge for poor countries, which typically have the least developed tax systems and enforcement. Around $160 billion each year fail to reach developing nations because of multinationals' tax avoidance, according to a recent report by Christian Aid. That is more than they receive in aid from rich nations.The push on tax reform at the Sydney G20 meeting was firmly backed by Washington and Australia and the United States signed a deal on the eve of the meeting under the U.S. Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act that targets ""non-compliant"" taxpayers using foreign bank accounts.Tightening the tax rules would prevent so-called Base Erosion and Profit Shifting by multinationals that exploit gaps and mismatches in national tax rules to make profits ""disappear"" from high tax regimes and shift to low tax locations. ""What we are doing is not to say, well, we need to close down Bermuda,"" Pascal Saint-Amans, director of the OECD's Centre for Tax Policy and Administration, told reporters.""There will be a neutralisation of these types of schemes and that is what we are doing and that where we think we can succeed, because if you try to dictate to countries what they have to do domestically, if you try to impede on their sovereignty, you cannot succeed.""French Finance Minister Pierre Moscovici said he intended to make Europe a leader in such efforts with France ready to sign agreements with Germany, Italy, Spain and Britain, within the next few weeks. Divisions remain within the G20 on issues such as whether technology companies should be taxed at the source country, where the customer is and value is created, or at the residence country, where the product originated. But Australia's Hockey said there was consensus that companies had to pay.The push also has some business support.""The Amazons of the world that operate in other countries don't pay taxes in Australia and don't employ people in Australia; those things concern me,"" said Richard Goyder, Chief Executive of Australian retail giant Wesfarmers Ltd and president of the B20 Australia forum of business leaders that liaises with the G20.The OECD standard builds on U.S. rules, which ask foreign financial institutions to report on all accounts held by U.S. citizens, or pay a punitive 30 per cent withholding on all U.S. income.Quentin Grafton, a professor of economics at the Australian National University in Canberra, welcomed the G20 commitment, but warned that achieving a global standard would be difficult given tax havens like Bermuda and Ireland are not part of the grouping.""This is a win-lose proposition, so that makes it a difficult proposition,"" he said. ""Those countries that will lose out will try and oppose it.""Grafton said the OECD has been trying for more than a decade to bring about tax reform and the next test would come in September when it reports on planned actions.",2014-02-23,AMZN,"Sun Feb 23, 2014 | 3:51pm EST","RPT-G20 agrees on push to close tax loopholes, make multinationals pay",http://www.reuters.com//article/g20-australia-tax-idUSL1N0LS0DF20140223?type=companyNews

It said roaming charges for sending text messages and for using any regulated data roaming services should also be phased out by the same deadline.The committee also sided with proponents of net neutrality, concerned that telecoms companies might block or slow access to content on the Internet or charge content providers more for delivering their services at faster speeds.""Where such agreements are concluded with the provider of internet access, that provider should ensure that the enhanced quality service does not cause material detriment to the general quality of internet access,"" the EU document said. Telecoms operators, some of whom might already have such deals, said industry sources, are opposed to the proposed rule.""The principle that all types of Internet traffic have to be treated equally is at odds with the way in which the Internet works today, as different types of traffic have different requirements and need to be managed efficiently,"" Luigi Gambardella, head of the European Telecommunications Network Operators' Association (ETNO), said.ETNO, whose members include Orange, Telecom Italia , Deutsche Telekom and Telefonica  but not Vodafone, conveyed its criticism jointly with the GSMA, the worldwide mobile operators' lobbying group, to Kroes and the committee.The committee will vote on the proposals at 1800 GMT. The proposals would still need the approval of EU lawmakers and 28 EU governments before becoming law.",2014-02-24,AMZN,"Mon Feb 24, 2014 | 7:39am EST",EU lawmakers want to scrap roaming fees by 2015 - EU paper,http://www.reuters.com//article/eu-telecoms-roaming-idUSL6N0LT20R20140224?type=companyNews

59,"   By Jonathan Stempel | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Feb 26 Apple Inc urged a U.S. appeals court to throw out a judge's ""radical"" finding that it violated antitrust law by manipulating electronic book prices, and blamed publishers for running a conspiracy it claimed to know nothing about.The request on Tuesday night came after U.S. District Judge Denise Cote in New York concluded last July after a nonjury trial that Apple had played a ""central role"" in illegally scheming as early as December 2009 with five publishers to raise e-book prices and impede competitors such as Amazon.com Inc .The publishers previously agreed to pay more than $166 million to settle related antitrust charges.Apple introduced e-books in 2010 to help boost sales for its then-new iPad tablet. In a filing with the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York, Apple said it ""had no knowledge that the publishers were engaged in a conspiracy"" at any time.It said it lawfully took advantage of market ""discord"" and the publishers' own frustrations with Amazon, and ""kick-started competition in a highly concentrated market, delivering higher output, lower price levels, and accelerated innovation.""Cote's decision ""is a radical departure from modern antitrust law,"" Apple said. ""If allowed to stand, the ruling will stifle innovation, chill competition, and harm consumers."" The Cupertino, California-based company asked the 2nd Circuit to reverse Cote's decision or else give it a new trial before a different judge.Apple also again faulted Cote's appointment of Washington lawyer Michael Bromwich to monitor its antitrust compliance, calling that oversight unconstitutional. The U.S. Department of Justice, which brought the case, was not immediately available on Wednesday for comment. That agency is expected to reply in writing to Apple's request.In her decision, Cote also found Apple liable to 33 U.S. states for antitrust violations. She is expected to consider possible damages later this year. Apple said the states and private plaintiffs sought more than $800 million of damages.On Feb. 10, the 2nd Circuit rejected Apple's request to halt Bromwich's oversight during its appeal.The case is U.S. v.

60,"  By Dhanya SkariachanFeb 27 U.S. retailer Best Buy Co Inc  reported a better-than-expected profit in the quarter covering the holiday season and said it would more aggressively cut costs this year to fund its turnaround efforts, sending shares higher in midday trading.The news heartened investors who had been concerned about profits being squeezed during the fourth quarter, the most heavily promoted and discounted holiday-shopping season since the recession, and shares rose 5.6 percent to $27.26.Best Buy had slashed prices throughout the holidays to thwart competition from Wal-Mart Stores Inc, Amazon.com Inc and other chains, and had warned last month of a bigger-than-expected drop in quarterly operating margins.""The quarter was less bad than everyone expected,"" said BB&T Capital Markets analyst Anthony Chukumba, who was encouraged by Best Buy's efforts to court online shoppers and rein in costs.The company's stock, one of 2013's hottest, is down 31 percent this year, while the larger S&P 500 Index index is down 0.2 percent. It trades at about 11.6 times forward earnings, while the retail sector trades at a multiple of 13.7.The world's largest consumer electronics chain said it would more aggressively cut annualized costs, by about $1 billion. It originally planned to cut costs by $725 million in North America, a target it has exceeded by $40 million.The retailer has earned a profit for three straight quarters, reaping the benefit of restructuring efforts spearheaded by Chief Executive Hubert Joly and Chief Financial Officer Sharon McCollam. Under Joly, Best Buy has stripped away layers of management, cut jobs and costs, shut unprofitable stores and boosted cash by selling its stake in a European joint venture with Carphone Warehouse Group Plc.MORE FAT TO CUT Still, Chukumba said the company had further fat to cut and expected the retailer to work on trimming corporate overhead expenses and personalizing its marketing. Earlier this week, the New York Post cited an inside source as saying the retailer could lay off more 2,000 managers. Best Buy declined comment on the report.Other analysts see Best Buy saving more due to its recent focus on improving how it manages items returned by shoppers.The retailer said it sees total sales and comparable store sales remaining slightly negative in the first half of the current financial year due to larger economic concerns, but did not give more details.""There are several moving parts to their guidance for the year, but today's release maintains our confidence that the turnaround is progressing,"" said Janney Capital Markets analyst David Strasser. Best Buy's overall adjusted operating margin was down 120 basis points at 4.5 percent in the holiday quarter, versus Strasser's estimate of 3.8 percent.The company earned a net $310 million, or 88 cents a share, from continuing operations in the fourth quarter ended Feb. 1. That follows a net loss of $461 million, or $1.36 a share, a year earlier.Excluding special items, it earned $1.24 a share. The special items included restructuring and asset impairment charges and the tax impact of Best Buy Europe sales.Analysts, on average, expected a profit of $1.01 a share excluding items, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Sales fell 3 percent to $14.47 billion, missing analysts' average estimate of $14.66 billion.Comparable store sales, comprising revenue at stores, websites and call centers operating for at least 14 full months, fell 1.2 percent.The company, which recently started shipping directly from its 1,400 stores to compete with rivals Amazon and Wal-Mart, said comparable online sales grew 25.8 percent at its domestic unit.",2014-02-27,AMZN,"Thu Feb 27, 2014 | 12:14pm EST",UPDATE 3-Better profit at Best Buy in holiday quarter cheers investors,http://www.reuters.com//article/bestbuy-results-idUSL1N0LW0W920140227?type=companyNews

The Otto Group, a mail order firm founded in 1949 which made the shift into e-commerce and now runs more than 60 websites worldwide including Germany's OTTO site, said online sales rose 7.6 percent to 6 billion euros ($8.24 billion) in 2013/14.Otto is facing stiff competition in its home market from Amazon, which saw German sales grow 21 percent to $10.5 billion in 2013, and online fashion retailer Zalando, which increased annual sales by 52 percent to 1.76 billion euros. Otto's online sales in Germany grew 7.8 percent to 4 billion euros in the financial year to Feb. 28, slower than the average for all e-commerce, which grew 12 percent in 2013 to 33.1 billion euros, according to the German Retail Federation (HDE).Otto is targeting group sales of 8 billion euros by 2015 and is investing 300 million euros in its online business to that end, including in new software for the OTTO website, mobile payments firm Yapital and other start-ups in e-commerce. It will launch a new online ""ecosystem"" for young fashion-conscious women with several special shops and is working on a company-wide ""mobile-first"" initiative, hoping to drive 50 percent of traffic onto smartphones and tablets by 2016.Otto currently appeals to an older market than Zalando and Britain-based online retailer ASOS Plc, which targets fashion-conscious 20-somethings. Zalando, whose biggest investor is Sweden's Kinnevik, is considering a possible floatation this year.Otto noted that every other German already owns a smartphone and one in five uses a tablet, with some of its online stores already seeing 40 percent of visits on mobile devices.""Smartphones and tablets enable a highly personalised, impulse driven shopping experience that is increasingly demanded by consumers,"" Rainer Hillebrand, deputy chairman of Otto Group, said in a statement.",2014-03-06,AMZN,"Thu Mar 6, 2014 | 8:44am EST","Germany's Otto invests to see off Amazon, Zalando threat",http://www.reuters.com//article/ecommerce-otto-idUSL6N0M336N20140306?type=companyNews
66,"   By Tom Bergin | LONDON  LONDON Amazon's tax affairs could come under more scrutiny in Britain, tax experts said, after a judge questioned whether it really was organized in the tax efficient way it said it was.The ruling comes as big technology groups, including Amazon, face increasing scrutiny in Britain over their tax practices.A UK judge ruled earlier this month that Amazon had infringed the trademark of soap maker Lush by posting advertisements on Google mentioning ""Lush soap"" and by offering customers who searched for ""Lush soap"" on its own website a list of options.Since Lush products were not available on Amazon's UK website - on the manufacturer's insistence - the judge ruled customers could be confused.Amazon did not respond to requests for comment. Lush said it welcomed the ruling. In addition to denying infringement, Amazon said only its main European operating subsidiary, Luxembourg-based Amazon EU Sarl., and not the group's UK subsidiary, Amazon.co.uk Ltd, should be a defendant.Amazon argued Amazon.co.uk Ltd had no case to answer because Amazon EU Sarl ran the UK business from Luxembourg, and that the British subsidiary simply provided services such as warehousing to the Amazon group.This structure is also the basis of Amazon's claim that its retail business doesn't have a tax residence in Britain - and that therefore, all revenues and profits should be declared in low-tax Luxembourg.

67,"   By Tom Bergin | LONDON, March 7  LONDON, March 7 Amazon's tax affairs could come under more scrutiny in Britain, tax experts said, after a judge questioned whether it really was organized in the tax efficient way it said it was.The ruling comes as big technology groups, including Amazon, face increasing scrutiny in Britain over their tax practices.A UK judge ruled earlier this month that Amazon had infringed the trademark of soap maker Lush by posting advertisements on Google mentioning ""Lush soap"" and by offering customers who searched for ""Lush soap"" on its own website a list of options.Since Lush products were not available on Amazon's UK website - on the manufacturer's insistence - the judge ruled customers could be confused.Amazon did not respond to requests for comment. Lush said it welcomed the ruling. In addition to denying infringement, Amazon said only its main European operating subsidiary, Luxembourg-based Amazon EU Sarl., and not the group's UK subsidiary, Amazon.co.uk Ltd, should be a defendant.Amazon argued Amazon.co.uk Ltd had no case to answer because Amazon EU Sarl ran the UK business from Luxembourg, and that the British subsidiary simply provided services such as warehousing to the Amazon group. This structure is also the basis of Amazon's claim that its retail business doesn't have a tax residence in Britain - and that therefore, all revenues and profits should be declared in low-tax Luxembourg.But the judge said Amazon's depiction of the role of the UK unit was ""wholly unreal and divorced from the commercial reality of the situation"".David Quentin, a lawyer with Stone King who has advised campaign group the Tax Justice Network, said the 'tortfeasance' rules that applied in the Lush case were different to those that govern tax cases.

68,"   By Patrick Temple-West | WASHINGTON, March 12  WASHINGTON, March 12 Prospects for federal action to resolve a fight over state sales taxation of online retailing faded on Wednesday in the U.S. Congress, after a senior Republican lawmaker said more debate is needed before legislation can move forward.The comments by Robert Goodlatte, chairman of the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee reduced the likelihood that the House might support a Senate bill that would empower states to collect sales tax on Internet purchases.The issue has been unsettled for years, with brick-and-mortar retailers, including those with big Internet businesses, saying it is unfair that they must collect state sales tax on their customers' purchases, while many shoppers who buy from strictly online retailers pay no sales tax. The difference gives a pricing edge to businesses that exist almost entirely online.State governments have said they lose $23 billion a year in uncollected sales taxes.The Senate approved a bill in May that would require most e-commerce businesses to collect state sales taxes.But the Senate bill ""suffers from fundamental defects,"" Goodlatte said, worrying that online businesses could be targeted by state auditors and aggressive state tax agents. Goodlatte gave no indication of when the House Judiciary Committee would mark up its own version of online sales tax legislation.Amazon.com Inc, the world's largest online retailer, has a big stake in the fight. Over the years, Amazon has resisted states' efforts to make it collect sales tax on consumer purchases, though it does so now in 20 states.Internet businesses do not need to collect a state's sales tax unless they operate a store, warehouse or have any physical presence on the ground in a given state. Under present law, people who make online purchases in which the seller does not include state sales tax are supposed to pay state sales tax on their own, but almost no one does -- or even knows about it.Twelve states have their own Internet sales tax laws today, up from just three in 2009, according to the Tax Foundation, a pro-business think tank in Washington.The patchwork of state laws complicates doing business online, and Amazon now favors a federal solution, along with big-box retailers such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc, as well as state governments that stand to gain additional revenue. ""The days of tax-free Internet shopping are gradually coming to an end,"" said Guggenheim Securities analyst Chris Krueger, though he predicted only a 30 percent chance that Congress will intervene with federal legislation this year.The Senate legislation was opposed by online companies, ranging from small online startups to eBay Inc.The Judiciary Committee's top Democrat, John Conyers, said he wants to move faster on passing an online sales tax bill this year.

69,"   By Phil Wahba and Deepa Seetharaman  Amazon.com Inc plans to hike the annual fee for its popular Prime service by 25 percent to $99 starting next week, a move announced on Thursday that risks losing customers for a feature that has helped drive its business.The increase comes about six weeks after Amazon warned that it may raise prices by as much as $40 to offset rising fuel and shipping costs. Prime, which offers unlimited two-day shipping among other perks, had cost $79 since its introduction in 2005.Later on Thursday, Amazon rival ShopRunner offered a free one-year membership to its own $79-a-year service to disgruntled Prime users who have not renewed their subscription at the higher rate. ShopRunner partners with brick-and-mortar retailers like Nieman Marcus and offers unlimited two-day shipping.The $20 hike for Prime is unlikely to spur users to drop the service en masse, analysts said.

In 2013, Amazon's shipping costs grew almost 30 percent to $6.6 billion as its sales grew. The increase in Prime's fee could add about half a billion dollars to Amazon's annual operating income, according to some analyst estimates.""If you consider things like inflation and fuel costs, a Prime membership valued at $79 in 2005 would be worth more than $100 today,"" Amazon spokeswoman Julie Law said. She declined to say how the company calculated the figure.Prime customers get a limited selection of book downloads as well as film and television streams as part of the service, which has helped expand Amazon's presence on mobile devices.

75,"  PRAGUE, March 18 The Czech Republic's second-largest city Brno dealt a blow to U.S. online retailer Amazon.com Inc's plans for a distribution centre in the south of the country, as councillors  voted on Tuesday to reject some conditions for its construction.The city council refused to back an amendment to the contract with Amazon that would have allowed funds to help build connections to the main highway near the plant's proposed site. The city also said its plan governing development did not allow construction.Amazon last year announced plans to build two distribution centres in the central European country, creating around 2,000 jobs in Brno. A site near Prague airport has already received a go-ahead. An Amazon spokeswoman was not immediately available to comment. The rejection comes as the Czech economy is starting to get back on its feet after exiting a record-long six-quarter recession in the second quarter last year. Unemployment remains at a record high but a jobless rate of 8.6 percent is still low compared with others in the region. Some countries such as Slovakia have already expressed interest in housing an Amazon logistics centre if it is rejected for Brno. Czech media reported the investment was worth 100 million euros ($139.1 million).""Brno wasted its chance to get a strong investor at a time of economic recession,"" said Brno Mayor Roman Onderka, a member of the country's ruling Social Democrat party, whose government had pushed for the investment.",2014-03-18,AMZN,"Tue Mar 18, 2014 | 1:51pm EDT",Czech city deals blow to Amazon's plans for distribution hub,http://www.reuters.com//article/amazon-czech-idUSL6N0MF4TE20140318?type=companyNews

78,"   By Alister Doyle, Environment Correspondent | OSLO  OSLO Heavy rains from the Amazon to Australia have curbed sea level rise so far this century by shifting water from the oceans to land, according to a study that rejects theories that the slowdown is tied to a pause in global warming.Sea level rise has been one of the clearest signs of climate change - water expands as it warms and parts of Greenland and Antarctica are thawing, along with glaciers from the Himalayas to the Alps.But in a puzzle to climate scientists, the rate slowed to 2.4 millimeters (0.09 inch) a year from 2003 to 2011 from 3.4 mm from 1994-2002, heartening skeptics who doubt that deep cuts are needed in mankind's rising greenhouse gas emissions.Writing in the journal Nature Climate Change on Sunday, experts said the rate from 2003-2011 would have been 3.3 mm a year when excluding natural shifts led by an unusually high number of La Nina weather events that cool the surface of the Pacific Ocean and cause more rain over land.""There is no slowing in the rate of sea level rise"" after accounting for the natural variations, lead author Anny Cazenave of the Laboratory for Studies in Geophysics and Spatial Oceanography in Toulouse, France, told Reuters.In La Nina years, more rain fell away from oceans, including over the Amazon, the Congo basin and Australia, she said.

Rainfall over land only temporarily brakes sea level rise.""Eventually water that falls as rain on land comes back into the sea,"" said Anders Levermann, a professor at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, who was not involved in the study. ""Some of it goes into ground water but most of it will drain into rivers, or evaporate.""HIATUS IN WARMING The apparent slowing of sea level rise coincided with what the U.N. panel of climate experts calls a hiatus in global warming at the Earth's surface, when temperatures have risen less sharply despite record emissions of greenhouse gases. ""The slowdown in sea level rise ... is due to natural variability in the climate and is not indicative of a slowdown in the effects of global warming,"" Nature Climate Change said.Many scientists suspect that the ""missing heat"" from a build-up greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is going into the deep oceans as part of natural variations in the climate.But, because water expands as it warms, that theory had been hard to reconcile with the apparent slowdown in sea level rise.

The U.N. panel of climate experts expects an acceleration, with gains of between 26 and 82 cms over 100 years to the late 21st century.Melting an ice cube with sides 7 kms (4.3 miles) long is roughly the equivalent of adding a millimeter of water to the world's oceans.Last year, another study said that unusually heavy downpours over Australia in 2010 and 2011 had curbed sea level rise, before a rebound reaching a rate of about 1 centimeter a year globally, partly as water flowed back into the sea.""It has tailed off in the past 12 months or so"" to above 3 mm a year, said John Fasullo of the U.S. National Center for Atmospheric Research who was lead author of the Australia study.For the Nature Climate Change study: here(Reporting By Alister Doyle; Editing by Rosalind Russell)",2014-03-23,AMZN,"Sun Mar 23, 2014 | 2:17pm EDT","Shifts in rainfall, not warming pause, slow sea level rise",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-climate-sealevel-idUSBREA2M0J420140323?type=companyNews

The U.N. panel of climate experts expects an acceleration, with gains of between 26 and 82 cms over 100 years to the late 21st century.Melting an ice cube with sides 7 kms (4.3 miles) long is roughly the equivalent of adding a millimetre of water to the world's oceans.Last year, another study said that unusually heavy downpours over Australia in 2010 and 2011 had curbed sea level rise, before a rebound reaching a rate of about 1 centimetre a year globally, partly as water flowed back into the sea.""It has tailed off in the past 12 months or so"" to above 3 mm a year, said John Fasullo of the U.S. National Center for Atmospheric Research who was lead author of the Australia study.For the Nature Climate Change study: here(Reporting By Alister Doyle; Editing by Rosalind Russell)",2014-03-23,AMZN,"Sun Mar 23, 2014 | 2:00pm EDT","Shifts in rainfall, not warming pause, slow sea level rise",http://www.reuters.com//article/climate-sealevel-idUSL6N0MI3SD20140323?type=companyNews

But the Fire TV is a latecomer to two markets that rivals had fought over for years -- gaming and home entertainment. Amazon has to wedge itself into a market split fairly evenly between various nascent technologies, all of which are challenging cable companies' traditional death-grip on TV viewing.But the company promised however that Fire TV, available now on Amazon.com, would be faster and easier to use than Apple TV, Google's Chromecast or Roku Inc's streaming video device.It can predict what the user will watch and cue it up, Kindle unit vice president Peter Larsen said. It also has a feature that uses data from IMDB to identify the music on screen as well as the actors and their filmography as they exit and enter the screen on TV.""When we look at the living room, how do we make the complexity disappear?"" Larsen said at a rare, Apple-style New York product launch event.Fire TV's remote features a microphone that enables voice-activated search. Fire TV is integrated with Hulu Plus so users can see Amazon shows from their Hulu account, and Amazon said it may bring in other partners soon.By next month, Fire TV users will be able to play thousands of video games. Amazon decided to develop the device after reading customer complaints on its website about lagging performance, cumbersome search and closed ""ecosystems"" on rival set-top boxes.Shares in Amazon ended down 0.3 percent at $341.96 on Nasdaq.

96,"  (Adds Amazon comment)By Alexei OreskovicSAN FRANCISCO, April 2 Apple Inc, Google Inc and Facebook Inc have made significant progress in adopting renewable energy sources to power their Web services, the environmental group Greenpeace said in a report on Wednesday.But energy-hungry data centers operated by some of the Internet industry's top companies remain overly reliant on carbon-emitting coal and gas, the report said.Apple Inc, which built an on-site solar panel farm and fuel-cells at its North Carolina data center and has procured renewable energy directly at its other three facilities, earned the highest marks on the ""scorecard"" of Internet company data centers that Greenpeace issues every two years.Greenpeace rated Apple's efforts in transparency, renewable energy policy and renewable energy deployment with an A grade in each category, compared with a mix of D and F grades two years ago when the group released its last report.At the other end of the spectrum, Amazon.com Inc's  Web Services business, which Greenpeace said operates at least 18 data centers around the world, was singled out for being among the least committed to renewable energy, earning F grades in three out of Greenpeace's four categories. Some Internet companies ""have refused to pay even lip service to sustainability and are simply buying dirty energy straight from the grid,"" said the report. ""Those companies, most notably Amazon Web Services, are choosing how to power their infrastructure based solely on lowest electricity prices.""Amazon disputed Greenpeace's assessment of its data center operation, saying that the report's data and assumptions were inaccurate. Amazon said in an emailed statement that data centers in two regions in which it operates use ""100 percent carbon-free power"" without elaborating.Data centers, multibillion-dollar facilities stuffed with racks of tightly-packed computers, are the heart of the fast-growing Internet industry. The facilities store consumers' email and other personal data, and help deliver popular online offerings such as Netflix's streaming video service and Facebook's photo-laden social network. A large Internet data center requires energy capacity of as much as 80 megwatts, which would be enough to power about 65,000 U.S. homes, according to Greenpeace spokesman David Pomerantz.The increasing prevalence of Internet services means growing demand for electricity in the coming years, Greenpeace said.Six major Internet services companies - Facebook, Apple, Google, Box, Rackspace and Salesforce.com - have committed to making their data center operations 100 percent based on renewable energy, according to the report. Those commitments are putting pressure on utilities to offer wind, solar and other forms of renewable power, Greenpeace said. The report looked at 19 companies that operate more than 300 data centers combined. Greenpeace used information provided by the companies and utilities to estimate what portion of a company's Internet infrastructure is going to be based on renewable energy, which it refers to as a ""Clean Energy Index.""Renewable energy credits, which a company can purchase to meet clean energy goals, were not counted.Apple's Clean Energy Index was 100 percent, while Facebook and Google were rated by Greenpeace at 49 percent and 48 percent, respectively.Google has been a leader in committing to renewable energy, with procurement deals to purchase wind power from utilities in several states, Greenpeace said. But with 13 data centers, compared with Apple's four, the company faces a bigger task in shifting its overall energy usage to renewable sources.Amazon Web Services, which Greenpeace said operates more than 10 data centers in the Virginia area, had a Clean Energy Index of 15 percent, according to Greenpeace.

101,"   By Tiisetso Motsoeneng and Nomatter Ndebele | JOHANNESBURG  JOHANNESBURG E-commerce firm Africa Internet Holdings (AIH) has launched a person-to-person lending service as a digital alternative to banks, adding to its range of businesses which include a would-be African Amazon.While e-commerce has been a fixture in developed markets for more than a decade, it has only recently gained momentum in Africa as smartphones help consumers leap-frog the continent's lack of traditional fixed-line Internet connections.Berlin-based AIH's newest contribution to Africa's small but fast-growing e-commerce sector is Lendico, an online marketplace for loans from one person to another that initially targets South Africa.Lendico hopes to connect borrowers with lenders. Borrowers can request loans of between 3,000 rand and 200,000 rand ($290-$19,000), with interest rates starting at about 8 percent. The site uses its own algorithms to assess borrowers' risk and set the rates. ""It's kind of a digital alternative to banks and we're very excited because we think South Africa is going to be a great market, where there is a lot of consumer credit,"" Sacha Poignonnec, co-Chief Executive of AIH, said at the Reuters Africa Summit in Johannesburg.Lendico is the ninth web-based venture in AIH's portfolio which also includes hotel booking site Jovago, taxi booking service Easytaxi, and Jumia - an online shopping mall which aims to emulate some of the success of Amazon (AMZN.O).Although none of AIH's established ventures have yet turned a profit, Poignonnec said the businesses were ""doubling or tripling"" either their quarterly or annual sales. But he declined to disclose any sales values. ""The way I see it is very simple: Online shopping is going to become very big in Africa,"" said Poignonnec. ""It's no secret that in Africa it's difficult to find the supplier of products.""Founded in 2012, AIH has a presence in 13 African countries, including Nigeria, Egypt, Morocco, Ivory Coast and Ghana. Its investors are venture capital firm Rocket Internet, Luxembourg-based telecoms group Millicom International (MICsdb.ST) and Africa's biggest mobile phone firm MTN Group (MTNJ.J).($1 = 10.5153 South African rand)Follow Reuters Summits on Twitter @Reuters_Summits(Editing by Pascal Fletcher and Pravin Char)",2014-04-07,AMZN,"Mon Apr 7, 2014 | 1:29pm EDT",E-commerce firm AIH bets on peer-to-peer lending,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-africa-summit-aih-idUSBREA361EW20140407?type=companyNews

108,"   By Malathi Nayak and Deepa Seetharaman | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Amazon.com Inc, a company known for its ruthless drive, is courting the free-wheeling coders and dreamers of the gaming industry with a lighter touch as it seeks to break into an arena now dominated by Apple and Google.The online retailer, infamous for undercutting rivals and pressuring suppliers, hopes that making nice with game developers will help it build a vibrant app platform on its new Fire TV and gain ground in an area where it severely lags the competition.For example, Amazon last year contacted London-based developer Ashraf Hegab out of the blue.

109,"   By Malathi Nayak and Deepa Seetharaman | SAN FRANCISCO, April 8  SAN FRANCISCO, April 8 Amazon.com Inc, a company known for its ruthless drive, is courting the free-wheeling coders and dreamers of the gaming industry with a lighter touch as it seeks to break into an arena now dominated by Apple and Google.The online retailer, infamous for undercutting rivals and pressuring suppliers, hopes that making nice with game developers will help it build a vibrant app platform on its new Fire TV and gain ground in an area where it severely lags the competition.For example, Amazon last year contacted London-based developer Ashraf Hegab out of the blue. In contrast to the sink-or-swim style of Apple's and Google's app stores, Amazon promised to promote his game actively if he brought it to its platform, he said.""With Amazon, it feels a lot more intimate and personal,"" said the founder of eight-month startup Playir.

""When you go to Bahia, they have a different kind of beat for samba as well, different instruments. It's still samba, but they have their own accent, which makes it very interesting.""

""Rio 2"" is a sequel to a 2011 film about a vibrantly colored family of rare macaw birds in Brazil. Jesse Eisenberg and Anne Hathaway provide voices for the avian parents who take their family to the Amazon in search of a possible colony of their critically endangered brothers and sisters.Global sales for the film, which cost $103 million to make, reached $164 million through Sunday, according to Fox.""Our target was to equal the first one, and that's what we did,"" said Chris Aronson, president of domestic distribution for 20th Century Fox, a unit of 21st Century Fox, referring to ""Rio,"" which took in $39.2 million on its opening weekend. Aronson said the film was positioned well going forward as well, with spring break and school holidays in the coming weeks.""There's not another animated film (opening) for nine weeks, so it gives us a nice long runway,"" he said, adding that exits polls for both parents and children were strong, and that the film was playing better than expected with African-American and Hispanic audiences.""Captain America,"" which stars Chris Evans as a scrawny World War Two reject given super powers from an experimental serum, is the latest superhero hit from Disney's Marvel Studios. The film has earned a total of $476 million since it started rolling out internationally on March 26, validating the  strategy of distributor Disney to ramp up its pipeline of films featuring Marvel Comics super heroes.Since Disney bought Marvel for $4 billion in 2009, Marvel characters have starred in some of Hollywood's biggest hits.  ""Iron Man 3"" was last year's second-highest grossing film with domestic sales of $409 million, while 2012's ""Marvel's The Avengers"" was the third-biggest film in Hollywood history, with $623.4 million in domestic sales and $1.5 billion worldwide.""Oculus,"" distributed by Relativity Media, stars British actress Karen Gillan as a young woman who is convinced an ornate mirror in her home is haunted. Like Blum's other horror hits, it cost less than $5 million to make. Relativity paid $2.5 million for rights to distribute the film in the United States and Canada.Football drama ""Draft Day"" earned the No. 4 slot, grossing $9.75 million. The movie stars Kevin Costner as fictional Cleveland Browns general manager Sonny Weaver Jr., who races the clock to maneuver for the best players while dealing with upheaval in his personal life. Several scenes were filmed during last year's real-life NFL draft.Rounding out the top five, the dystopian action film ""Divergent""  pulled in $7.5 million.

119,"  FRANKFURT Working practices at the German operations of two of Europe's largest online retailers have come under fire this week, with more strikes at Amazon and Zalando being forced to defend its warehouse operations after a critical TV report.Hundreds of workers walked off their jobs on Thursday at Amazon distribution centers in the German cities of Bad Hersfeld and Leipzig in a year-long pay dispute, and labor union Verdi warned that more walkouts were to follow.""We are here and will continue to strike,"" workers' representative Christian Kraehling told Reuters. ""And there will be more, bigger strikes.""Verdi wants Amazon to raise pay for workers at its distribution centers in accordance with collective bargaining agreements across the mail order and retail industry in Germany.Amazon, however, has rejected the demand, arguing that it regards warehouse staff as logistics workers and says they receive above-average pay by the standards of that industry.The workers have gone on strike repeatedly in the pay dispute, which started around a year ago, including in the run-up to Christmas when online retailers rely on business from customers buying gifts on the Internet. Verdi also wants to gain more representation at Zalando, Europe's biggest online fashion retailer, which was the subject this week of a television report in which an undercover reporter got a job at one of its warehouses under a fake name and used a hidden camera to film working practices.""We are working on organizing colleagues at Zalando,"" Stefan Najda, Verdi's representative for online and mail order, told Reuters on Thursday.

""We are here and will continue to strike,"" workers' representative Christian Kraehling told Reuters. ""And there will be more, bigger strikes.""Verdi wants Amazon to raise pay for workers at its distribution centres in accordance with collective bargaining agreements across the mail order and retail industry in Germany.Amazon, however, has rejected the demand, arguing that it regards warehouse staff as logistics workers and says they receive above-average pay by the standards of that industry. The workers have gone on strike repeatedly in the pay dispute, which started around a year ago, including in the run-up to Christmas when online retailers rely on business from customers buying gifts on the Internet.Verdi also wants to gain more representation at Zalando, Europe's biggest online fashion retailer, which was the subject this week of a television report in which an undercover reporter got a job at one of its warehouses under a fake name and used a hidden camera to film working practices.""We are working on organising colleagues at Zalando,"" Stefan Najda, Verdi's representative for online and mail order, told Reuters on Thursday.

122,"   By Tom Bergin | LONDON  LONDON The amount of money Amazon.com Inc reports through a tax-exempt vehicle in Europe has dropped sharply in the past two years, even as European sales jumped, after the U.S. tax authority tightened rules it felt were being abused to shift profits.Amazon (AMZN.O) minimizes its tax bill by having the U.S. unit which owns its technology licenses lease the rights to re-license the technology to a tax-exempt partnership based in Luxembourg.This partnership then resells the software rights to other affiliates for a much higher price, corporate and court filings show.Such arrangements have drawn fire from politicians on both sides of the Atlantic as well as citizens struggling with higher personal taxes and cutbacks in state services imposed to pay for the financial crisis.The Group of 20 leading economies has vowed to crack down on corporate tax avoidance and the practice of shifting profits into low or no tax jurisdictions.Amazon has been a frequent subject of politicians' criticism in Europe over the way it channels all European revenues to Luxembourg where profits can be earned tax free.However, since 2012, when a dispute between the company and the UK tax authority was disclosed in court filings, the amount of profit reported by the group's Luxembourg-based tax-exempt partnership, Amazon Europe Holding Technologies SCS, has halved.The company declined to comment on Friday but has previously said it follows the tax rules in all the countries where it operates.The U.S. tax authority, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) declined to comment, citing federal privacy rules that prohibit it from discussing individual taxpayers.Most companies seek to pay no more tax than they have to because managers have a fiduciary duty to investors to maximize long-term profits. Amazon and the IRS have been in dispute for years about Amazon Europe Holding. The unit pays U.S. affiliates to use existing software and shares the U.S. affiliates' cost of funding new technology, in return for the right to re-license this technology to affiliates in Europe.According to a filing with the U.S. Tax Court in December 2012, the IRS has argued that Amazon Europe Holding should have paid much more to the U.S. affiliates, A9.com Inc and Amazon Technologies Inc., for the rights it received.If Amazon Europe Holding had paid more, this would have increased Amazon group's U.S. taxable income. The IRS said Amazon Europe should have paid the U.S. arm an additional $110 million in cost-sharing payments in 2006 alone.Amazon took a legal challenge against the IRS claims, saying its 2005-to-2011 payments were appropriate, the December 2012 court filing said.Nonetheless, from 2012, Amazon Europe Holding increased the amount it paid its U.S. affiliates substantially.In 2012, it paid them 408 million euros, up from 229 million euros in 2011. In 2013, it paid 420 million, accounts filed in Luxembourg this week showed. Amazon declined to say why the payments had risen. Lawyers and accountants say the IRS has been tightening the rules covering inter-company cost-sharing agreements since December 2008.Last year, it finalized new rules curtailing the discount rates companies could use when deciding the prices for inter-company cost-sharing deals.""Amazon's decision is probably a result of negotiation with the IRS. I don't think that's something they would have chosen to do,"" said Richard Murphy, a tax adviser-turned-campaigner.The higher payments mean profits at Amazon Europe Holding have fallen sharply, even as its income has risen.Profits of 157 million euros last year were up from 118 million in 2012, but these results compare to profits of 302 million to 442 million between 2008 and 2011. No tax was paid on that income, accounts show. Cost-sharing agreements are widely used by U.S. companies including Google and Microsoft. Yet the contracts are not published and deals usually involve subsidiaries in the Caribbean or Singapore, where companies are not obliged to file accounts.Despite the higher payments its European operation is making to U.S. affiliates, Amazon's European business continues to thrive, with profit margins around 50 percent higher than at its U.S. operation.Revenues at Amazon's three main European operating units were 15.8 billion euros last year, up 18 percent. This includes sales by Amazon EU Sarl, which retails books and consumer goods, Amazon Media EU Sarl, which sells music downloads and Amazon Services Europe Sarl which sells auction services to third-party retailers.

They are liable to Luxembourg corporate income tax and had a combined charge of 11 million euros in 2013, accounts filed this week show.By having these three units pay large fees to Amazon Europe Holding, which is tax exempt, Amazon minimizes its total tax bill.Including Amazon Europe Holding, the main Luxembourg-based subsidiaries reported profits of 209 million euros, meaning a profit margin of 1.3 percent on European sales. The group's margin is 0.7 percent, according to Amazon's annual report.The actual European result could even be slightly higher, as it excludes profits from subsidiaries across Europe, which have not yet filed accounts for 2013.The main operating units in Britain, Germany and France reported combined profits of around 33 million euros in 2012.The low profits at these subsidiaries which employ most of the staff and assets, reflect the fact they are funded by fees from the Luxembourg companies.

127,"   By Deepa Seetharaman | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Amazon.com Inc's quarterly results on Thursday may heighten worries that its edge over online and even traditional brick-and-mortar rivals is narrowing as it charges sales tax in more states, curtailing growth in its core business.Amazon, which has expanded aggressively into mobile devices and computing services to try to sustain its pace of growth, may lose customers to a growing crop of retail startups and major chains that had been slow to react but are now focusing on their own online commerce strategies, analysts say.Longer term, the imposition of sales taxes across a growing number of states could exacerbate that trend.""The imposition of state sales taxes in major markets such as California, Texas, and Pennsylvania may have caused a growth drag,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney wrote in a note this week. He listed five other potential reasons, including aggressive price cuts by retailers that undercut Amazon's advantage.The largest U.S. online retailer's year-over-year unit sales growth - a closely watched measure of how many items Amazon has sold - has slowed considerably over the past two years. This has hobbled the stock, down more than 17 percent this year and the ninth worst performing stock in the S&P 500 index.RBC Capital expects unit sales to grow in the mid-20 percent range in the first quarter. This would approach the fourth quarter's 25 percent jump but fall short of the 30 percent rise of a year ago and the 49 percent jump in the first quarter of 2012. Amazon is expected to report first-quarter earnings per share of 23 cents. Revenue is expected to jump 21 percent to $19.4 billion. Rival eBay Inc will report earnings on April 29.TAPPING THE BRAKES One big reason for the deceleration in unit sales growth is the growing number of U.S. states forcing Amazon to levy sales tax, analysts say. Amazon says it now collects taxes in 20 states - including California and Texas - and will begin doing so in Florida next month, with Maryland next up. In states where it collects taxes, household spending on Amazon's website fell about 10 percent, according to a survey of 245,000 households that spent at least $100 a month in 2012's first half, conducted by Ohio State University.Since the financial crisis, U.S. states have been looking to plug holes in their budgets. State governments have said they lose $23 billion a year in uncollected sales taxes.The so-called ""Amazon Tax"" has shifted consumers' shopping behavior, Ohio State researchers found. This is particularly true for purchases exceeding $300, when Amazon sales fall by 24 percent if a state sales tax is imposed.

BakerApril 23 Amazon will begin streaming some HBO shows to its premium customers next month, the companies said on Wednesday, in a move that could lure subscribers away from Netflix Inc, a company they both compete with.The companies said this was the first time HBO, the premium cable channel owned by Time Warner Inc, had licensed its programming to an online subscription streaming service. HBO shows are not available through Netflix.Netflix shares fell 4.9 percent to $354.54.HBO's top program, ""Game of Thrones,"" and shows newer than three years old are not part of the deal. Older hit series ""Sex and the City,"" ""Entourage"" and ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" are also excluded because they are tied up in syndication deals on cable. Amazon has been building up its content libraries to tap the growing appetite for online video, and its Amazon Instant Video product has been taking on Netflix. Like Netflix, Amazon has been dabbling in original programming, with ""Alpha House,"" a comedy starring John Goodman.Terms of the deal were not disclosed. Last June, Amazon agreed to pay more than $200 million to Viacom Inc for access to mostly children's programming from channels such as Nickelodeon. At the time, that was Amazon's largest subscription-streaming transaction ever.Amazon Prime customers will have access to the HBO programming on May 21, but most of it will first be older shows such as ""The Sopranos"" and ""The Wire,"" or a smattering of earlier seasons from current series such as ""True Blood."" HBO said episodes of shows such as ""Girls,"" ""The Newsroom"" and ""Veep"" will be not be available until three years after it shows them.Popular streaming service HBO Go will also be available on Amazon's Fire TV, a new Internet-based TV device, by the end of the year. While HBO is not letting Amazon get all of its wares, it shows a new willingness on the network's part to be flexible in licensing as well as a shift away from agreements with traditional cable networks. HBO's past licensing deals have been with networks such as E!, TV Guide Network and A&E.Older seasons of serialized shows will fare better online than on traditional cable, and the Amazon deal could ultimately draw in new subscribers to the premium channel.Time Warner broke out HBO's financials for the first time last quarter, giving investors a better picture of how the business stacks up against Netflix.HBO's operating income rose 8 percent to $1.7 billion last year. While the unit is much more profitable than Netflix, it is growing much more slowly in terms of revenue and subscribers than the younger company.Time Warner shares were 1.3 percent higher at $65.73, while Amazon fell 1.1 percent to $325.70.

153,"  * Metro unit says major challenges facing industry* Media-Saturn CEO says some store managers clinging to past* Piloting same-day home delivery to beat Amazon* Number of stores to exceed 1,000 by early 2015* About 200 jobs to go in administrationBy Emma Thomasson and Matthias InverardiBERLIN/DUESSELDORF, April 30 Europe's biggest electronics chain Media-Saturn said on Wednesday it would restructure its business in response to a rapid shift towards online retailing, skirting around a new phase in a power struggle between its owners.Media-Saturn, which is majority-owned by German retailer Metro and runs more than 950 stores in 17 countries, wants to integrate online sales more closely with stores and will create a new ""e-business"" unit to coordinate strategy.""The European electronics trade is currently facing major challenges. As the market leader of the industry, we have decided on a profound reorientation to future-proof ourselves,""  Chief Executive Horst Norberg said in a statement, calling the upheaval the biggest since the company was founded in 1979.Media-Saturn's move into e-commerce was delayed until 2010 by a long-running dispute between Metro and the chain's founder Eric Kellerhals, who still owns a stake of close to 22 percent. That power struggle burst into the open again on Tuesday when Kellerhals attacked Metro's running of Media-Saturn. Metro retaliated by saying Kellerhals was hurting the business and its employees with ""amazing and outlandish"" comments.In an interview published on Wednesday but conducted before the latest salvo from Kellerhals, Norberg said Media-Saturn    had the support of all its owners for its strategy, adding he saw more resistance to change from some store managers, who sometimes tried to ""cling to the past"".""Our daily business is barely affected by the conflict,""  Norberg told Germany's Die Welt daily.The latest war of words was triggered after Kellerhals made a call last week on his own website for applications to replace Norberg when he retires. Norberg, 66, said he still enjoys the job and wants to see through his contract until the end of 2015. ""THROUGH THE TROUGH?"" After a slow start, online sales are now growing fast at Media-Saturn but some investors say the chain's target for 20 percent of sales to eventually come from e-commerce is not ambitious enough and they have questioned whether store managers have the right incentives to promote online.Media-Saturn, the world's second biggest consumer electronics chain after Best Buy, which competes with     Dixons Retail and Darty Plc, saw sales fall 0.7 percent to 6.6 billion euros ($9.12 billion) in the last quarter of 2013, hurt by falling currencies in eastern Europe.Sector experts expect another drop for the January to March period when Metro reports results on May 8. Media-Saturn accounts for about a third of Metro's sales. Metro shares were down 0.4 percent at 0950 GMT, outpacing a 1.3 percent drop in the European retail index.Media-Saturn said it would be investing in technology as part of its new strategy, but would also make cuts in its administration, with around 200 jobs set to go.Norberg said the rise of online commerce meant Media-Saturn would probably have to close some stores or reduce their size, but said he still expects to increase the total number of stores to over 1,000 by the end of 2014 or start of 2015.""There are still a lot of people who like to browse and look at innovations and have new things explained to them. Store trade is far from over,"" he told Die Welt.""I am sure that we are now through the trough and we will be considerably more successful in coming years.""As it seeks to outflank the likes of Amazon, Norberg said Media-Saturn is launching a pilot programme to offer home delivery within three hours in big German cities.It is piloting a discount store under the Media Markt Depot name in Hungary and plans another three in Poland and possibly other countries, he said. It is also testing Saturn Connect, a smaller store format concentrated on mobile phones, laptops and computers in Poland and the Netherlands.($1 = 0.7237 Euros)   (Reporting by Emma Thomasson and Matthias Inverardi; Editing by John Stonestreet)",2014-04-30,AMZN,"Wed Apr 30, 2014 | 6:02am EDT",Electronics chain Media-Saturn squares up to e-commerce challenge,http://www.reuters.com//article/metro-mediasaturn-idUSL6N0NM2X720140430?type=companyNews
154,"   By Deepa Seetharaman | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO May 5 Ticketfly, which harnesses data analytics to promote events, hired a former Amazon executive to run day-to-day operations as the start-up adds more events to its roster and lays the groundwork to expand internationally.The San Francisco-based company tapped Steve Oliver, who spent 9 years at Amazon.com Inc and led the e-commerce giant's Canadian operations, as chief operating officer. Oliver will also shape long-term strategy in the role starting May 5.""Ticketfly is growing at a remarkable clip and will greatly benefit from Steve's experience scaling operations at Amazon,"" Ticketfly cofounder and CEO Andrew Dreskin said. Since its 2008 launch, Ticketfly has raised $37 million in venture capital from backers including Mohr Davidow Ventures and SAP Ventures. It is likely to raise additional funds soon.The startup is also on track to promote more than 120,000 events in 2014, up from 80,000 last year, and powers some 450 websites. Its partners include the Pitchfork Music Festival and Burning Man, which tapped Ticketfly to do ticketing in January. But Ticketfly competes with well-funded rivals including Ticketmaster, part of Live Nation Entertainment Inc, and Eventbrite, an event ticketing platform founded in 2006 whose investors include Tiger Global Management and Sequoia Capital. In an interview, Oliver said he would develop Ticketfly's strategy by drawing from his experiences at Amazon, which include launching the Prime service in Canada and running various aspects of Amazon's DVD and digital video business.""There's definitely a methodology and a framework that Amazon uses to think about problems,"" he said. ""That methodology generally involves starting with the customer and being data-based and being analytical.""Last year, Ticketfly opened its first office outside the Unites States in Canada. It also launched a product to allow venues and event promoters to identify top fans and offer them loyalty rewards. On average, 7 percent of ticket buyers account for almost one-third of revenue, according to Ticketfly data.",2014-05-05,AMZN,"Mon May 5, 2014 | 3:01am EDT",Ticketfly taps former Amazon exec for operating role,http://www.reuters.com//article/tech-ticketfly-idUSL2N0NP02D20140505?type=companyNews

She called for a delay of ""at least a month"" on Wheeler's plan. FCC spokesman Neil Grace said Wheeler still intends to put forward his proposals for public comment next week, as planned, as part of a ""robust public debate"" on the Internet.""Moving forward will allow the American people to review and comment on the proposed plan without delay, and bring us one step closer to putting rules on the books to protect consumers and entrepreneurs online,"" Grace said in a statement. With two Republican commissioners broadly opposed to  regulation of Internet traffic, the support of two Democrats on the panel - Rosenworcel and Mignon Clyburn - is critical.Tens of thousands of public comments have been received by the FCC on Wheeler's plan over the past two weeks, and commission staff has met with nearly 100 stakeholders, including public interest groups and Internet content providers. The latest to weigh in is the consortium of technology and Internet companies, which ranged from household names to small startups. They called on the FCC to ""take the necessary steps to ensure that the Internet remains an open platform for speech and commerce.""Commission rules should not permit ""individualized bargaining and discrimination,"" the companies said.Engine Advocacy and New America's Open Technology Institute, long-time supporters of Open Internet policies,  helped organize the effort.(Reporting by Alina Selyukh; Editing by Ros Krasny, Sandra Maler and Jan Paschal)",2014-05-07,AMZN,"Wed May 7, 2014 | 7:07pm EDT",UPDATE 2-Tech firms write to U.S. FCC to oppose 'net neutrality' plan,http://www.reuters.com//article/netneutrality-companies-idUSL2N0NT2KL20140507?type=companyNews

Inc fell 6.6 percent to $34.07 after Alibaba Group filed for an initial public offering that valued the Chinese e-commerce company well below analysts' consensus estimate.Analysts at BGC Partners and Atlantic Equities told Reuters that Alibaba's valuation disappointed some Yahoo investors. Yahoo holds a 22.6 percent stake in Alibaba, of which it must sell more than a third through the IPO.""The Alibaba IPO is drawing money out of Internet stocks because investors have to raise capital for the Alibaba IPO. That's why we see pressure on names like Google, Facebook and Amazon today,"" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Group in Bedford Hills, New York. Google shares fell 1 percent to $509.96 while Facebook shares slid 2 percent at $57.39. Amazon.com Inc  declined 1.6 percent to $292.71.Groupon Inc sank 20.7 percent to end at $5.33 as its sales and profit projections for the current quarter trailed some estimates.Twitter Inc lost 3.7 percent to close at $30.66 after leading a selloff in Internet shares on Tuesday with an 18 percent tumble.The Dow Jones industrial average rose 117.52 points or 0.72 percent, to close at 16,518.54. The S&P 500  gained 10.49 points or 0.56 percent, to end at 1,878.21. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 13.085 points or 0.32 percent, to finish at 4,067.673. After declining in the morning session, the Dow and the S&P 500 moved into positive territory after Yellen said the U.S. economy was still in need of lots of support, given the ""considerable slack"" in the labor market in remarks to the congressional Joint Economic Committee.Yellen's comments enabled investors to shift attention to what may be an easing of the tensions in Ukraine, as Russian President Vladimir Putin called on pro-Moscow separatists in Ukraine to postpone a vote on secession just five days before it was to be held.""Janet Yellen didn't say anything new in her testimony. She continues to talk about how they are data dependent, how they can change on a dime, but she didn't say rates are going up any time soon, which is exactly what people expected,"" said Ken Polcari, director of the NYSE floor division at O'Neil Securities in New York.""Coupled with the fact that technically the market found some support, then (investors) started concentrating on what Putin said,"" Polcari added. Whole Foods Market Inc also contributed to the Nasdaq's decline as the organic grocer's stock tumbled nearly 19 percent to $38.93.The stock was the biggest drag on both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 indexes a day after Whole Foods posted second-quarter results and cut its 2014 outlook.Of 422 companies in the S&P 500 that had reported earnings through Wednesday morning, 68.2 percent beat expectations, above the 63 percent average since 1994, and exceeding the 66 percent beat rate for the past four quarters, according to Thomson Reuters data.Profits are expected to rise 5 percent this quarter, down from 6.5 percent estimated at the start of the year, but above the low of 0.6 percent in mid-April, according to Thomson Reuters data.In the latest snapshot of the U.S. economy, the Labor Department said that U.S. nonfarm productivity fell at its fastest pace in a year in the first quarter because of severe weather. That led to the largest gain in unit labor costs in more than a year. Productivity fell at a 1.7 percent annual rate in the quarter, the Labor Department said.About 7 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, well above the 6.1 billion average over the past five days, according to data from BATS Global Markets.Advancers outnumbered decliners on the New York Stock Exchange by a ratio of nearly 2 to 1.

157,"   By Guillermo Parra-Bernal and Brad Haynes | SAO PAULO  SAO PAULO France's Casino (CASP.PA) hired Morgan Stanley & Co (MS.N) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) to list its global e-commerce platform spanning from Brazil to Thailand, a person familiar with the plan said on Tuesday, as the group faces competition from U.S. giant Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and Chinese rival Alibaba IPO-ALIB.N.Casino's Brazilian subsidiary, GPA SA (PCAR4.SA), said in a securities filing that the group was preparing to combine the online units for a potential initial public offering in the United States. According to the source, who requested anonymity because the plans are private, the preference is for an IPO on the Nasdaq stock exchange.The deal would bring new firepower to an e-commerce player with more than $4 billion in annual sales in France, Brazil, Colombia, Thailand and Vietnam at a time when major rivals are expanding their global reach. Shares of Casino rallied almost 3 percent to 91.68 euros in early Wednesday trading in Paris.The French group, whose full name is Casino Guichard Perrachon & Cie, said that ""a listing of the combined entity on the U.S. stock market, where many significant Internet technology players are listed, is being considered to speed up its development and boost visibility."" It did not mention any advisers for the IPO.With the plan, Casino ""is prioritizing management focus and alignment for execution over ownership and process simplification,"" said Gustavo Oliveira, an analyst with UBS Securities. ""This could drive global collaboration and best practices sharing, but tangible short-term revenues or synergies are almost non-existent.""Amazon arrived in Brazil earlier this year with its Kindle e-reader, and eBay Inc (EBAY.O) and is launching a site in Portuguese this week for Brazilian consumers. Chinese Internet powerhouse Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, which focuses in Brazil on business-to-business commerce, filed a prospectus on Tuesday for an IPO in the U.S. that is expected to raise upwards of $15 billion to expand its business.The decision to list on the Nasdaq should help lure some of the world's best technology investment firms into the plan, the source added. Morgan Stanley has had a leading role for years in underwriting major technology IPOs.ACCRETIVE DEAL  The decision comes after Casino undertook a deep restructuring of its Brazilian businesses following the departure of long-time partner Abilio Diniz from GPA less than a year ago.GPA's press office declined to comment on specifics of its plans. Casino officials in Brazil could not immediately be reached for comment. Media representatives for Morgan Stanley and J.P.Morgan in New York had no comment.According to the filing, the transaction intends to combine Casino's e-commerce assets into an international holding company initially known as NewCo, while seeking to maintain the efficiencies of its joint e-commerce and bricks-and-mortar business. Nova Pontocom, the online unit of GPA, had about $2 billion in sales last year on websites serving the Brazilian market. Casino's e-commerce division, Cdiscount, booked 2013 sales of about $2.1 billion in France and opened websites for Thailand, Vietnam and Colombia this year.According to Marcel Moraes, a retail analyst with Deutsche Bank Securities in São Paulo, the deal ""could potentially create value for shareholders of NewCo by sharing knowledge between the different platforms and, consequently, accelerating each region's learning curve.""

According to the source, who requested anonymity because the plans are private, the preference is for an IPO on the Nasdaq stock exchange.The deal would bring new firepower to an e-commerce player with more than $4 billion in annual sales in France, Brazil, Colombia, Thailand and Vietnam at a time when major rivals are expanding their global reach. Shares of Casino rallied almost 3 percent to 91.68 euros in early Wednesday trading in Paris.The French group, whose full name is Casino Guichard Perrachon & Cie, said that ""a listing of the combined entity on the U.S. stock market, where many significant Internet technology players are listed, is being considered to speed up its development and boost visibility."" It did not mention any advisers for the IPO.With the plan, Casino ""is prioritizing management focus and alignment for execution over ownership and process simplification,"" said Gustavo Oliveira, an analyst with UBS Securities. ""This could drive global collaboration and best practices sharing, but tangible short-term revenues or synergies are almost non-existent."" Amazon arrived in Brazil earlier this year with its Kindle e-reader, and eBay Inc and is launching a site in Portuguese this week for Brazilian consumers.Chinese Internet powerhouse Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, which focuses in Brazil on business-to-business commerce, filed a prospectus on Tuesday for an IPO in the U.S. that is expected to raise upwards of $15 billion to expand its business.The decision to list on the Nasdaq should help lure some of the world's best technology investment firms into the plan, the source added. Morgan Stanley has had a leading role for years in underwriting major technology IPOs. ACCRETIVE DEAL The decision comes after Casino undertook a deep restructuring of its Brazilian businesses following the departure of long-time partner Abilio Diniz from GPA less than a year ago.GPA's press office declined to comment on specifics of its plans. Casino officials in Brazil could not immediately be reached for comment. Media representatives for Morgan Stanley and J.P.Morgan in New York had no comment. According to the filing, the transaction intends to combine Casino's e-commerce assets into an international holding company initially known as NewCo, while seeking to maintain the efficiencies of its joint e-commerce and bricks-and-mortar business.Nova Pontocom, the online unit of GPA, had about $2 billion in sales last year on websites serving the Brazilian market. Casino's e-commerce division, Cdiscount, booked 2013 sales of about $2.1 billion in France and opened websites for Thailand, Vietnam and Colombia this year.According to Marcel Moraes, a retail analyst with Deutsche Bank Securities in São Paulo, the deal ""could potentially create value for shareholders of NewCo by sharing knowledge between the different platforms and, consequently, accelerating each region's learning curve."" In addition, it would trigger large purchasing power by boosting scale.Cdiscount, Casino's e-commerce unit in France, has extensive expertise in private label products, techniques for sales conversion and in platforms for the market place, Deutsche Bank's Moraes said.According to the filing, GPA and its appliance unit Via Varejo SA created an independent committee to help the boards of both companies implement the plan and preserve the shareholders rights of the subsidiaries.Veteran banker Eleazar de Carvalho Filho, Luiz Aranha do Lago and Maria Helena Santana, a former head of securities industry watchdog CVM, will oversee the committee, the filing added.

161,"  (Adds comments by FCC Commissioner Clyburn, background; paragraphs 4-5, 13-17)By Alina SelyukhWASHINGTON May 7 More than 100 technology companies, including Google Inc, Facebook Inc, Twitter Inc and Amazon.com Inc, have written to U.S. telecom regulators to oppose a new ""net neutrality"" plan that would regulate how Internet providers manage Web traffic.The letter to Federal Communications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler and the agency's four commissioners, warning of a ""grave threat to the Internet,"" came as one FCC commissioner called for a delay of a vote on the plan scheduled for May 15.""Rushing headlong into a rulemaking next week fails to respect the public response to his (Wheeler's) proposal,"" Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel said on Wednesday in remarks prepared for delivery at an industry meeting. She called for a delay of the vote to formally propose Wheeler's plan by ""at least a month.""Wheeler has been under fire for proposing new so-called ""open Internet"" or ""net neutrality"" rules that would allow content companies to pay broadband providers for faster Internet speeds delivering their traffic as long as the deals are deemed ""commercially reasonable.""Consumer advocates are worried the rules would ultimately allow Internet companies such as Comcast Corp or Verizon Communications Inc to create ""fast lanes"" on the Web for traffic of content companies that pay up, potentially shutting out poorer newcomers. The latest to weigh in is the consortium of technology and Internet companies, which ranged from household names to small startups. They called on the FCC to ""take the necessary steps to ensure that the Internet remains an open platform for speech and commerce.""Commission rules should not permit ""individualized bargaining and discrimination,"" the companies said.Engine Advocacy and New America's Open Technology Institute, long-time supporters of Open Internet policies, helped organize the effort. FCC spokesman Neil Grace said Wheeler does not plan to delay the May 15 vote. Though Wheeler has written and spokes about his proposal, the proposed rules have not been made public in full.""Moving forward will allow the American people to review and comment on the proposed plan without delay, and bring us one step closer to putting rules on the books to protect consumers and entrepreneurs online,"" Grace said in a statement.Tens of thousands of public comments have been received by the FCC on Wheeler's plan over the past two weeks, and commission staff has met with nearly 100 stakeholders, including public interest groups and Internet content providers. With two Republican commissioners broadly opposed to  regulation of Internet traffic, the support of two Democrats on the panel - Rosenworcel and Mignon Clyburn - is critical for Wheeler's proposal to pass.""I am listening to your voices as I approach this critical vote to preserve an ever-free and open Internet. ... My mind remains open as I continue to evaluate how best to promote these fundamental, core values,"" Clyburn said, reiterating her opposition to pay-for-priority arrangements.To read Rosenworcel's comments, go to bit.ly/1uC4JHuTo read Clyburn's comments, go to fcc.us/1s4ukENA handful of protesters gathered in the rain in front of the FCC headquarters in Washington on Wednesday afternoon, vowing to show up daily until the May 15 vote, when a high-profile demonstration is expected.Consumer advocates have long urged the FCC to reclassify Internet service providers as more highly regulated utilities, like the telecom companies, a view that has faced staunch opposition from Republican lawmakers and broadband companies.

162,"   By Tom Bergin | LONDON  LONDON May 9 Amazon.com Inc filed accounts on Friday showing a UK tax bill of 10 million pounds ($16.95 million) despite $7.3 billion sales in Britain, because the company reports most of its European profit in a tax-exempt Luxembourg partnership.Amazon.co.uk Ltd reported a 56 percent rise in profit to 17 million pounds ($28.82 million) during 2013 on a 13 percent rise in UK revenues, which one academic said could mean the company came under pressure from the UK tax authority to change its tax arrangements.Corporate tax avoidance has become a hot topic in Europe following revelations in the past couple of years about how companies like Apple and Google pay little tax in many of their main markets. Amazon said it follows all the tax rules in every country where it operates. Apple and Google also say they pay all the tax they should. HMRC declined comment.All Amazon customers in Europe contract directly with and pay Luxembourg based Amazon companies for the goods and services they buy. These companies reduce their taxable income by paying fees to a tax exempt partnership, also based in the Grand Duchy. Amazon.co.uk is funded by its Luxembourg-based affiliates. The rates of such inter-company remuneration are usually agreed with the UK tax authority. In 2013, intercompany fees paid to Amazon.co.uk Ltd rose 40 percent to 449 million pounds.The result was that Amazon's current tax bill for 2013 was its biggest ever. ""It's possible Amazon may have come under pressure from HMRC (the UK tax authority) to adjust their inter-company agreements,"" Prem Sikka, Professor of Accounting at Essex University said.The amount of money Amazon.com Inc reports through the tax-exempt partnership that sits atop its European corporate structure has dropped sharply in the past two years, after the U.S. tax authority tightened rules it felt were being abused to shift profits.A Reuters Special Report on Amazon's European structure is available at: here ($1 = 0.5899 British Pounds)   (Reporting by Tom Bergin; Editing by Elaine Hardcastle)",2014-05-09,AMZN,"Fri May 9, 2014 | 7:10am EDT",Amazon's UK tax bill 10 mln stg on $7 bln sales,http://www.reuters.com//article/amazoncom-britain-tax-idUSL6N0NV2DK20140509?type=companyNews

165,"  * Flipkart to buy majority stake in Myntra - Myntra official* Snapdeal raises $100 mln from investors - company official* Indian online retail growing rapidly, Amazon expandingBy Nandita BoseMUMBAI, May 21 With Amazon.com Inc  ramping up its presence in India, two local online retailers are preparing for tougher competition with separate deals worth a combined $400 million set to be finalised this week.Flipkart, India's largest online retailer, is expected on Thursday to announce its acquisition of a majority stake in online fashion retailer Myntra in a deal worth about $300 million, said an official from Myntra who did not want to be named as he was not authorised to speak with the media.In a separate deal, local online retailer Snapdeal has raised $100 million from five investors, a company official said on Wednesday. The deal will be announced in a few days, he said. The Snapdeal investors include Temasek Holdings, an official with the Singapore state investor said.The two deals come after Amazon, the world's biggest online retailer, last year slashed prices and rolled-out next-day delivery in a bid to win market share in India's fast-growing e-commerce industry.""Amazon is scaling up .... much faster than expected and that is forcing everyone from retailers to investors in these companies to re-think,"" said Ashish Jhalani, founder of e-tailing India, a retail consultancy.""The sentiment here at the moment is about survival, it's about now or never,"" he said. Bangalore-based Flipkart, set up by two ex-Amazon employees in 2007, has sought to grow its presence in the online fashion segment, a category where Myntra is the market leader.Tiger Global Management and Accel Partners are investors in both Flipkart and Myntra.Flipkart and Myntra declined to comment. Snapdeal, an online marketplace that facilitates transactions between third party suppliers and customers, is set to complete its second round of funding this year by raising $100 million, the company official said.The official declined to be named and did not provide details. Snapdeal Chief Executive Officer Kunal Bahl was not immediately available for comment.The Economic Times newspaper, citing an unnamed source, reported on Tuesday that other investors in Snapdeal included BlackRock Inc and Hong Kong-based Myriad Asset Management. Myriad declined to comment and BlackRock did not respond to a request for comment.The Indian e-commerce market was worth $13 billion in 2013, according to a joint report by KPMG and the Internet and Mobile Association of India, with online travel accounting for over 70 percent of consumer e-commerce transactions last year.Online sales of retail goods totaled $1.6 billion in 2013, according to research firm Forrester, and are expected to reach $76 billion by 2021, according to consultancy Technopak.By comparison, China's business to consumer e-commerce sales may surpass $180 billion this year, with industry leader Alibaba IPO-ALIB.N readying an initial public offering (IPO) worth more than $15 billion.

167,"  * Otto online sales up 6.4 pct to 6.063 bln euros in 2013/14* Executive pay to be tied to sustainability targets* Otto squeezed by Amazon, ZalandoHAMBURG, May 21 Germany's Otto, Europe's second biggest e-commerce player, emphasised on Wednesday to its commitment to ethical standards as it tries to face off stiff competition from Amazon and other online rivals.The Otto Group, a family-owned mail order firm founded in 1949 which shifted into e-commerce in the 1990s and now runs dozens of websites worldwide, said executive pay would be tied to the achievement of sustainability goals.These include increasing the use of organic cotton and hard woods certified as from a sustainable source as well as reducing emissions of carbon dioxide and improving working conditions for employees in its supply chain. ""Values are something that sets Otto apart from many other companies,"" Chief Executive Hans-Otto Schrader told a news conference, adding customers, employees and other partners increasingly demanded that Otto act responsibly.He said the collapse of a garment factory in Bangladesh in which more than 1,100 workers died last April had underlined the need for the clothing industry to take such issues seriously.Otto reported a 1.5 percent increase in earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) to 392 million euros ($536.86 million) for the year ended Feb. 28 on sales that rose 1.8 percent to 12 billion euros. Online sales grew 6.4 percent to 6.063 billion euros, including a 7.2 percent rise in Germany to 3.96 billion euros, albeit at a slower pace than 12 percent growth rate reported for total e-commerce by the German Retail Federation (HDE).Consultancy Booz & Company predicts that e-commerce will grow in Germany to account for 29 percent of sales of apparel, electronics and furniture by 2020, up from 13 percent in 2012. Otto is facing competition from Amazon, which saw German sales grow 21 percent to $10.5 billion in 2013, and online fashion retailer Zalando, which increased annual sales by 52 percent to 1.76 billion euros.However both companies have attracted negative headlines in recent months in Germany for their treatment of warehouse workers, who have repeatedly gone on strike at Amazon over pay and conditions.Schrader admitted Amazon was proving a formidable rival, noting it was aggressively cutting prices to win market share in some areas. But he said Otto was fighting back in others, noting Amazon had stopped selling shoes.""We win more than we lose,"" he said.However, Schrader declined on Wednesday to give a concrete forecast for the current financial year, citing the tense global political climate around Ukraine, noting that the group made around 600 million euros of sales in Russia.

168,"   By Paulo Prada | RIO DE JANEIRO  RIO DE JANEIRO May 21 Brazil's government, the World Wildlife Fund and various partners are expected to unveil an agreement on Wednesday that would establish a $215 million fund for conservation of protected jungle in the Amazon rainforest.The fund, which seeks to ensure conservation of over 90 protected areas in the Amazon, comes as renewed developmental pressures mount in the region, resulting last year in an uptick in deforestation figures after years of record lows.Under the terms of the agreement, partners in the fund will make annual contributions to help Brazil meet financing needs for the protected lands, whose combined area totals more than 60 million hectares, or an area 20 percent larger than Spain.Contributions, partners said, will be contingent upon conditions required of Brazil, including audits of the government body that will administer the fund and continued staffing and financing of government offices required to administer the rainforest areas. Money from the fund would be used for a range of basic conservation measures, including fences and signs to delineate protected areas and to pay for vehicles used to patrol them.Through the agreement, ""the government of Brazil is committing to the budget and the regulations that are needed to secure future financing for the Brazilian Amazon,"" said Carter Roberts, chief executive of the WWF, the non-governmental organization that helped organize the fund, in an interview.Officials at the Brazilian environment ministry, which said  it would make an announcement regarding financing for protected lands on Wednesday, did not return calls seeking comment. Brazil's government through 2012 made large inroads against deforestation, largely through strict environmental enforcement and financial measures that blocked credit for companies and individuals caught doing business with loggers, ranchers, farmers or others known to exploit illegally cleared land.In recent years, however, the government has made changes to  environmental agencies and regulations that critics say make it easier for would-be developers to target protected areas. The government has also altered borders of some parkland to make way for infrastructure projects, including hydroelectric dams  on various Amazon tributaries. Financing for the new fund, expected to pay out over 25 years, was secured from private and public sources including the German government, the Inter-American Development Bank, the World Bank, philanthropists and the Amazon Fund, an existing facility financed mostly by the Norwegian government and administered by Brazil's national development bank.Together, the forest zones targeted by the fund are known as the Amazon Region Protected Areas, or ARPA, a program established in 2002 to coordinate financing and conservation strategy in the region.Whereas previous financing for the effort relied on cumulative fundraising efforts, partners this time agreed to an all-or-nothing approach, borrowed from private-sector financing practices, to build momentum toward a target total. The $215 million is the amount calculated as necessary to help the Brazilian government, over the 25 years, become self-sufficient in terms of financing the rainforest areas.""The effort is really about understanding that it takes the Brazilian government time to get there,"" Roberts said. ""This is continuity and support over time to close the gap.""

169,"   By Liege Albuquerque | MANAUS, Brazil  MANAUS, Brazil May 23 Manaus is best known as a stopover for travelers on the way to and from eco tours in Brazil's Amazon rainforest, but in many ways it is more like a bustling frontier outpost of the modern, industrial world on a distant, jungle planet.Visitors may find the sci-fi feel of the place enhanced by the fact that the only reliable ways to get there are by plane or river boat. The next closest urban center, Belém, is 777 miles (1,250 km) away, and Manaus is a four-hour flight from Rio de Janeiro or São Paulo. (Map: goo.gl/maps/wQcdt)Manaus is surrounded on three sides by mostly impassible jungle and on the other by rivers: the enormous Rio Negro and the almost unimaginably more powerful Amazon River.When you step off the plane, even the air can seem other-worldly, a hot, humid blast that feels like steam - so much so that physical effort can be utterly exhausting.But this city of 2 million is more than just jungle. It is a free-trade zone with an oil refinery and dozens of electronics and appliance factories. Its residents, an ethnic soup of Brazilians of native Indian, African, European and Japanese descent, assemble everything from cellphones to Harley-Davidson motorcycles.To keep all this going you need life-support. The city protects itself from the hostile environment with ice-cold air conditioning. Passing from refrigerated hotel to scorching sidewalk to refrigerated taxi can be a thermal shock.Soccer fans should be prepared to sweat when Manaus hosts four World Cup games next month in a new $300 million stadium that looks destined to become a white elephant. Arena Amazônia is the venue for England vs Italy, Cameroon vs Croatia, USA vs Portugal and Honduras vs Switzerland.Here are some tips for getting to know Manaus from Reuters, whose 2,600 journalists in all parts of the world offer visitors the best local insights.OPERA IN THE AMAZON Colonial houses, churches and monuments dating back to the 1850s are clustered in Largo Sao Sebastião, where the star attraction is a French Belle Époque opera house built over a century ago by rubber barons - the 700-seat Teatro Amazonas.This year, the April 19-June 30 opera season includes 33 performances. Visitors looking for high culture in the Amazon can see Puccini's ""Manon Lescaut,"" Donizetti's ""Lucia di Lammermoor"" or Bizet's ""Carmen."" For breakfast with a view of the Rio Negro, visit the newly restored Adolpho Lisboa market on Rua dos Barés. It was inspired by Paris's Les Halles market and features Portuguese stained glass. The crafts sold there are unique to the Amazon.TASTE OF THE JUNGLE While an excursion to a nature lodge or a river cruise up the Amazon to Peru is the best way to experience the rainforest, you can also visit the jungle without foregoing urban comforts.The National Institute of Amazonian Research offers 32 acres (13 hectares) of forest within the city limits. Visitors can see the Amazon River's aquatic life in nearby aquariums. For a closer encounter with the jungle, a five-hour trek still gets you back to civilization in time for dinner. Mosquito repellent, water and close-toed shoes, preferably boots to protect against parasites and other creepy crawlers, are mandatory for setting foot in the Amazon.One such excursion leaves from the Hotel Tropical Manaus, a sprawling resort just outside the city. The guides are walking encyclopedias on the rainforest, its daunting trees, exotic fruits and medicinal plants. Tours, for a minimum of five people, cost 195 reais ($87) a head. Jungle creatures like tapirs and jaguars tend to stay hidden but you may see monkeys, parrots and toucans.If you stay at the Hotel Tropical, one of the city's best nightclubs is on the top floor. (www.tropicalmanaus.com.br)PINK DOLPHINS A cruise down the Rio Negro is another way to explore the jungle. Companies like Fontour (www.fontur.com.br) and Amazon Explorers (www.amazonexplorers.tur.br) do excursions in English.Both use large boats equipped with bathrooms. An Amazon Explorers' cruise costs 135 reais ($60) per person and departs from the port near the Adolpho Lisboa market. Fontour charges 150 reais ($67) a day, and leaves from the Hotel Tropical pier. About 30 minutes out, visitors experience ""the meeting of the rivers,"" when the dark, tea-colored waters of the Rio Negro touch the clearer waters of the Rio Solimões, as the upper Amazon is known in Brazil. The rivers run side by side for several miles, eventually coming together in swirls as different temperatures and water densities balance.With any luck passengers will also see playful, pink river dolphins, or their gray cousins known as ""Tucuxi.""The itinerary also includes stops at a floating restaurant for lunch and a market with indigenous crafts. There, you may get to hold a sloth, or a ""lazy beast,"" as the locals call them.TOXIC SOUP? Fish dishes in Manaus are served with fried plantain, yellow manioc flower, and rice and beans. A typical breakfast features fruits and juices found nowhere else, like the pulpy cupuaçu and palm fruits pupunha and tucumã.For a more exotic meal, order tacacá, a soup made from the wild cassava root common to the Amazon. To eat the wild cassava, you have to squeeze out the juice and boil it, which removes its toxic qualities.The result is a yellowish cooking broth packed with nutrients that Amazon tribes call tucupi. Tacacá is hot tucupi with dried shrimp and jambú, a spinach-like green that briefly numbs the tongue.Restaurants like Banzeiro (www.restaurantebanzeiro.com.br)  and Waku Sese (here) offer sophisticated recipes crafted with regional ingredients. Try the costela de tambaqui, the ribs of a giant river fish.For an afternoon stroll, walk along the Rio Negro toward the Ponta Negra, or ""Black Point."" The view can be stunning at sunset, as you sip on chilled coconut water.

170,"  QUITO May 22 Ecuador's environmental regulator gave the go-ahead Thursday to oil company Petroamazonas to develop two of three fields in its ITT project, one of the country's largest oil areas, controversially located around an ecological reserve.State-run Petroamazonas will be able to exploit the Tiputini field outside of the Yasuni National Park and the Tambococha field inside it, but the third field - Ishpingo - was deemed to be located in an ecologically delicate area.The ITT project, whose name takes an initial from each of the fields, contains 920 million barrels of proven and probable reserves and is the jewel in the crown of OPEC's smallest member, which pumps around 530,000 barrels a day. The Tiputini field is expected to pump its first oil in March 2016, according to the environment ministry. ""Once the permit has been signed by the environmental authority, Petroamazonas will be able to begin preparatory work,"" the ministry said in a statement. That signature is seen as a formality and not likely to be an obstacle to the project. The ITT project is being revived after plans to preserve the area, declared a natural biosphere by UNESCO in 1998, fell apart. The idea was for international donors to pay Ecuador compensation in return for leaving the zone untouched.Oil extraction in Ecuador's portion of the Amazon rainforest has been controversial, as some projects by other companies have polluted water and land near areas inhabited by indigenous populations.

171,"  * Flipkart buys majority stake in Myntra; to invest over $100 mln* Snapdeal raises $100 mln from investors including Temasek* Indian online retail growing rapidly, Amazon expanding   (Updates with company confirmations, investment details, fresh comments)By Nandita BoseMUMBAI, May 22 Flipkart, India's largest e-tailer, on Thursday acquired the country's biggest fashion portal Myntra, as Amazon.com Inc's rapid expansion in the country stokes consolidation in the e-commerce industryFinancial terms of the deal were not disclosed but according to one person with knowledge of the development, the transaction is worth about $300 million.The acquisition is likely to give Flipkart, set up by two ex-Amazon employees in 2007, not just a stronger foothold in the fast-growing online fashion market, but also the additional scale it needs to fight competitors like Amazon, Flipkart co-founder Binny Bansal said.""This acquisition helps us grab a bigger market share and compete better,"" he said.Amazon, which entered India last June, has drawn up the battle lines by slashing prices, launching next-day delivery, adding new product categories and embarking on a high-voltage advertisement campaign. With growing competition, smaller e-commerce companies would find it difficult to access fresh capital and cope with a price war, forcing them to merge with bigger rivals, retail consultants said.Only 18 of the 52 e-commerce start ups in India - which raised $700 million in venture capital funding in three years ending 2012 - were able to raise follow-on investments last year, investment bank Allegro Advisors said.""The smaller companies who are growing and managing their business well face a bigger threat of being acquired by the top few companies than the ones who are not,"" said Ankur Bisen, senior vice-president at retail consultancy Technopak.The companies vying for a bigger slice of the Indian online retail market include Flipkart, New Delhi-based marketplace Snapdeal, Myntra, fashion e-tailer Jabong along with global giants Amazon and eBay Inc. Amazon is also looking for smaller acquisition targets in India to boost its presence in the country, several investment bankers said, piling pressure on home-grown players such as Flipkart and Snapdeal.The Indian e-commerce market was worth $13 billion in 2013, with online travel accounting for over 70 percent of consumer e-commerce transactions. Online sales of retail goods totaled $1.6 billion in 2013, according to research firm Forrester, and are expected to reach $76 billion by 2021, Technopak said.By comparison, China's business and consumer e-commerce sales may surpass $180 billion this year, with industry leader Alibaba readying an initial public offering (IPO) worth more than $15 billion. FASHION CONSCIOUS Bangalore-based Flipkart, which is popular for selling books and electronics online, said it would invest over $100 million in the fashion business over the next 12-18 months.Private equity investors Tiger Global Management and Accel Partners are investors in both Flipkart and Myntra.Flipkart, which hit the $1 billion gross merchandise value (GMV) mark in March this year, a year earlier than the company expected, has received $560 million of funding since 2007.Myntra, which sells products from over 650 brands like Adidas, Calvin Klein and Levis, has a GMV of about $204 million.  GMV is an important e-commerce performance metric as the revenue depends on gross merchandise sold and fees charged.Both companies will be run independently, said Flipkart co-founder Sachin Bansal.In a separate deal, Snapdeal raised $100 million from five investors including Temasek Holdings (Private) Ltd, its second fund raising this year.($1 = 58.7750 Indian Rupees)   (Editing by Sumeet Chatterjee)",2014-05-22,AMZN,"Thu May 22, 2014 | 7:14am EDT",UPDATE 1-India's Flipkart buys fashion portal as Amazon spurs consolidation,http://www.reuters.com//article/online-retail-india-idUSL6N0O82KL20140522?type=companyNews
172,"  (The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.)By Jack ShaferMay 27 I've got an Amazon habit. Like many of my other habits - coffee drinking, newspaper reading, excessive profanity - it's one that I've cultivated and refined over the years, ever since I made my first purchase on June 24, 1996, for a new copy of Dan Wakefield's ""New York in the Fifties.""In the beginning, I used Amazon primarily as a gift-delivery service. Later, I became the primary recipient of my purchases. Later still, I started ""subscribing"" to stuff my family regularly consumed, and after that I purchased an Amazon Prime membership, that amalgam of ""free"" movie streaming, speedy and cheap delivery of purchases, and more, including many purchases of audio books from the company's Audible subsidiary. I purchased Amazon's Kindle Paperwhite, which now anchors a drawer filled with orphaned devices and chargers. But I've resisted an Amazon.com Rewards Visa Card from Chase. You've got to draw the line somewhere.One would think with that many hooks into me, I'd be more an Amazon slave than a customer. But that's not so. Thanks to the company's recent non-response to criticism that it's abusing its market power - a silence that's consistent with Amazon's we'll only-talk-if-we-want-to-promote-something media policy - I've made the easy decision to turn my back on the world's biggest store. The dispute appears to be over pricing, with big-five publisher Hachette refusing to accept Amazon's terms on e-books, although nobody can be sure because Hachette has been evasive about the exact cause of the dispute, and Amazon has so far refused to discuss it with the press or anybody else. What's transparent is that Amazon has slowed delivery of popular Hachette titles, including works by Malcolm Gladwell, Alexie Sherman, J.D. Salinger, and many others, and on a separate front is refusing pre-orders on many soon-to-be published Hachette books, such as J.K. Rowling's next effort.Ordinarily I'd ignore this scrimmage between two capitalist antagonists and go find something random on Amazon to buy while drinking a strong cup of joe, reading my newspaper, and swearing randomly. But Amazon's silence has made me madder than an anaconda stuffed into a black garden hose and left to cook in the Arizona sun, to paraphrase Ed Anger of Weekly World News.If Amazon thinks I don't care about its silence, it's wrong. I take it personally that the company doesn't think it owes me even a half-baked explanation for why I can't buy some books from it. Unlike other dedicated readers, I hold nothing against Amazon for changing the book business, helping to drive many retailers under and accruing power over publishers. The customer has been the benefactor here, with Amazon creating a reader's paradise of cheap new and used books that it delivers quickly. The company's customer service department has always decided disputes in my favor and done so promptly, and its return policies are uniformly good.But while Amazon may have captured my wallet, its recent behavior has convinced me to take my business elsewhere. As long as the company's high-pressured negotiating tactics served my interests - lower prices, expansive selection, superb service - I was on board. But the company has erred in this dispute. It would have been okay with me if it had hard-balled the publisher by refusing to discount its books or even insisted on selling them at a premium. In that case, I could do what I usually do - make individual decisions about where to buy stuff based on price and availability. But by essentially banishing many Hachette titles from its stock, Amazon, which ordinarily puts its customers first, has put them last, telling them they can't buy certain titles from it for any price.If Amazon prevails in this clash, will it put me and my material needs last whenever a supplier resists its will? I don't know for sure, but I can guess. It could be that Amazon holds the unassailable high moral ground in the dispute and I should be yelling at Hachette instead, and if that turns out to be the case, I will amend these contentious words.Until Amazon addresses the currently unpleasantness, I'm deleting my ""Wish List"" and canceling my food subscription. (I paid in advance for Prime. You won't hold it against me if I still stream free programs until my account comes up for renewal later this year and I bail, will you?) There are other places to buy books, Luna Bars, computers, lawn mowers, fashion accessories, music, lady bugs, uranium ore, Roswell UFO soil, fake poop, and more.Like the woman profiled in the New York Times last week, Amazon's conduct has made me a little embarrassed to be its customer. Amazon doesn't owe me access to Hachette titles, and I don't owe Amazon my business. So I'm stuffing my 1-click button into my drawer of abandoned devices and chargers and won't reclaim it until Amazon makes this thing right.

175,"  * Hachette operating in 'good faith' but two sides at odds -Amazon* Affected Hachette titles can be bought from third-party sellers   (Adds comments from Amazon, background on dispute)By Deepa SeetharamanSAN FRANCISCO, May 27 Amazon.com Inc is preparing for a long battle with Hachette Book Group over a contract dispute that led the U.S. online retailer to curtail sales of some of the publisher's books.In a statement on Tuesday, Amazon said Hachette, a unit of French media company Lagardere SCA, has operated in ""good faith"" but the two sides remain at odds. The comments, the first by Amazon since the dispute became public in early May, didn't disclose details of the disagreement between the pair.""Though we remain hopeful and are working hard to come to a resolution as soon as possible, we are not optimistic that this will be resolved soon,"" Amazon said in a statement posted online. [link.reuters.com/zum69v ] Hachette didn't immediately respond to an email seeking comment outside of regular business hours.Amazon has been buying fewer print books from Hachette and last week removed an option to pre-order Hachette titles that will be published in the future. These include ""The Silkworm"", an upcoming novel written by author of the Harry Potter series J.K. Rowling, under the pen name Robert Galbraith. In recent weeks, authors and other publishing insiders have criticized Amazon for unfairly wielding its power as a major retailer to gain an edge in contract talks.""What I don't understand about this particular battle tactic is how it is in the best interest of Amazon customers,"" author James Patterson said in a May 13 post on his Facebook page.In a letter to authors posted on May 23 on the website of the Authors Guild, a group for book authors, Hachette chief executive Michael Pietsch said the publisher was looking for a solution ""that preserves our ability to survive and thrive as a strong author-centric publishing company."" In its statement on Tuesday, Amazon said customers looking to buy one of the affected titles should ""purchase a new or used version from one of our third-party sellers or from one of our competitors.""The company said it would put up half the money for a fund to help offset the loss in royalties to Hachette authors as a result of the disagreement if Hachette pays for the other half.Amazon has a record of being involved in combative negotiations. In 2010, the company blocked consumers from buying works published by Macmillan in a dispute over the price of e-books.""When we negotiate with suppliers, we are doing so on behalf of customers,"" Amazon said in its statement. ""Negotiating for acceptable terms is an essential business practice that is critical to keeping service and value high for customers in the medium and long term.""

176,"   By Diane Bartz | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The U.S. government's unwillingness to stop Amazon.com from using hardball tactics in fights with book publishers has angered book lovers but antitrust experts say regulators are unlikely to intervene in what appear to be business disputes. Amazon has delayed the delivery of some Hachette Book Group titles and even removed an option to pre-order ""The Silkworm,"" by Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling writing as Robert Galbraith. Hachette, the fourth largest U.S. book publisher, is owned by France's Lagadere SCA.The companies have not detailed the dispute but several media reports indicate it is over the pricing of e-books. Neither immediately responded to requests for comment. Some Amazon customers have gone public about their decision to buy books elsewhere. Advocates for authors and publishers use words like ""bullying"" and ""thuggish,"" and pine for government intervention.But the Hachette dispute as currently understood is a fairly typical fight between a retailer and a supplier, antitrust experts said. In fact, Amazon removed Macmillan Publishers from its book lists in 2010 during a similar spat. Advocates for publishers and authors had meetings with the U.S. Justice Department in 2011, which examined their complaints. ""The department did not take lightly the concerns expressed about Amazon (but) they didn't find an antitrust violation,"" said a person who was at the department then and who spoke on background to protect business relationships.""The publishers squeeze the authors as much as they can for as big of a take as possible. And Amazon squeezes publishers as much as they can for as big of a take as possible,"" the person said.Attorney Allen Grunes, veteran of the Justice Department now at Geyer Gorey LLP, said the Amazon-Hachette fight is a standard-issue business battle.  ""Yes, they're (Amazon) big but this sort of thing is not the basis for a monopolization investigation,"" he said.There are ways that Amazon could run into antitrust trouble - for example, if it conspired with publishers to set prices, as the Justice Department accused Apple and five major publishers, including Hachette, of doing in 2012. Or it could push down the prices it pays suppliers so far to be accused of monopsony, said Chris Sagers, law professor at the Cleveland-Marshall College of Law. A monopsony is a dynamic where many sellers have only one buyer, who can beat the sellers down on price.    ""But to show monopsony, you have to show that the suppliers are forced to sell their products at such a loss that we see a reduction in the supply of books for consumers,"" Sagers said, noting the high markup on hardcover books indicated that monopsony was likely not occurring.Hardcover fiction best-sellers typically sell for at least $15 on Amazon.com.

189,"   By Nandita Bose and Rajesh Kumar Singh | MUMBAI/NEW DELHI  MUMBAI/NEW DELHI India could allow global online retailers such as Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) to sell their own products as early as next month, removing restrictions that have held back competition in one of the world's biggest, and most price-sensitive, retail markets.The decision, which is likely to be announced in or alongside the budget, is one of the first tangible signs of economic reform by the business-friendly government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was sworn in 10 days ago.The move could allow the government to circumvent political opposition to opening up India's $500 billion retail sector to global retail giants such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT.N)Four people privy to discussions within the government told Reuters that officials believed a more robust online retail sector would spur manufacturing and consumption, helping revive an economy that has grown at below 5 percent for two years, the longest period of sub-par expansion since the late 1980s.""Most stakeholders support FDI (foreign direct investment),"" said a senior government official, referring to e-commerce. ""We have pitched for opening it up completely.""Industry surveys say e-commerce could contribute up to 4 percent to India's economy by 2020 from under one percent now.The official, like others who spoke to Reuters on the move, declined to be named because the matter was confidential. When asked about the decision, a spokesman for India's commerce and industry ministry declined to comment.Although New Delhi has been discussing opening up the sector since last year, the sources said a decision was imminent.    ""The way the government is initiating discussion, it is very clear that they are extremely serious about it,"" said an executive with a global online retailer who was invited to a meeting two weeks ago between the government and foreign and domestic companies.    ""They understand this will help small traders to grow their business, expand and reach out to a larger market,"" he said.While Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has been a vocal critic of the country's multi-brand retail policy, it has remained quiet on the proposal to open up the e-commerce sector.    On the campaign trail, Modi had asked small traders not to feel intimated by big online retail chains.    ""We should not worry about these things. Our children have taken IT to the world. We'll have to embrace it,"" he told a gathering of small traders in February.Modi will eventually decide investment guidelines as well as the foreign ownership cap, but the sources said the rules will be clearer and better than those for foreign investment in the supermarket sector. For example, implementation of the policy will not be left at the discretion of individual states, they said. But local sourcing and investment in the supply chain will be required.An Amazon spokesperson said the company did not comment on future events but believed opening up the sector would be good for consumers and Indian businesses and spur infrastructure development.""It would allow us to partner with local manufacturers to source products not carried by other sellers on the marketplace, giving Indian consumers unique and wider choices at lower prices.""Deepa Thomas, spokeswoman for eBay (EBAY.O) in India, said it was excited about the opportunity and believed in the need for a carefully calibrated approach to opening up the sector. CONSUMPTION-LED GROWTH The industry ministry that drafts FDI rules recently met officials from companies including Amazon, Google (GOOGL.O), eBay Inc, Wal-Mart and Indian e-tailer Flipkart to finalise the investment guidelines, the people said.Global online retailers like Amazon and eBay are currently banned from selling products they have sourced themselves, and must rely on third-party suppliers. Their platforms, which they own fully, are marketplaces for these outside suppliers.The government is likely to end this ban, paving the way for global retailers to bring their formidable supply chain, and cheaper goods, into India, potentially boosting consumption and benefiting small manufacturers and traders.Politically influential small-scale traders have traditionally opposed any foreign direct investment in retail, fearing they would be eclipsed by larger global rivals. The BJP is also against such investments, but the sources said the government supported the online retail expansion as global e-commerce firms would still have to rely on small traders to generate business.Opening up the online retail business for foreign direct investment is also widely expected to eliminate middlemen, leading to lower transaction, overhead, inventory and labour costs, industry officials said.Modi, who last month won the first outright parliamentary majority in three decades in Asia's third-largest economy, wants to kick start the sluggish economy by winning back domestic and foreign investor confidence.Regulatory uncertainty under the previous government prevented foreign supermarket chains from setting up shop in the country. So far, only Britain's Tesco PLC (TSCO.L) has announced an investment. In its election manifesto, the ruling BJP vowed to ban foreign supermarkets.LIFELINE TO LOCAL ONLINE RETAILERS? E-commerce is growing at the compound annual growth rate of 34 percent in India, according to a report from Digital–Commerce, IAMAI-IMRB.    Online travel services currently account for over 70 percent of consumer e-commerce transactions. Online sales of retail goods were $1.6 billion last year, according to research firm Forrester. But they will swell to $76 billion by 2021, predicts consultancy Technopak.    By comparison, China's business and consumer e-commerce sales are projected to surpass $180 billion this year.If approved, the policy will not only allow foreign retailers to expand in India, but will also give local online businesses access to much-needed foreign capital.    The companies vying for a bigger slice of the Indian online retail market include the country's largest e-tailer Flipkart, marketplace Snapdeal and fashion retailers Myntra and Jabong.    All retailers in the business are losing money due to high costs owing to high-voltage advertising campaigns, heavy discounts and an underdeveloped logistics network.    Only 18 of the 52 e-commerce start-ups in India - which raised $700 million in venture capital funding in the three years ending 2012 - were able to raise follow-on investments last year, investment bank Allegro Advisors said.    Most Indian e-tailers are aggressively scaling up in an effort to have the muscle to compete with Amazon, which slashed prices and improved delivery standards after entering India last year and is looking to acquire smaller retailers.

Rowling writing as Robert Galbraith.The companies themselves  - Hachette, the fourth largest U.S. book publisher, is owned by France's Lagadere SCA  - have not given details about the basis for the dispute but several media reports have indicated it is over the pricing of e-books. ""We are trying to understand what's going on there.

In December 2012, European Union regulators ended an antitrust probe into e-book prices, accepting an offer by Apple and four publishers to ease pricing restrictions on Amazon and other retailers. The decision handed Amazon a victory in its attempt to sell e-books cheaper than rivals in a fast-growing market that publishers hope will boost revenue and customer numbers.(Reporting by Huw Jones; Editing by Sophie Walker)",2014-06-05,AMZN,"Thu Jun 5, 2014 | 7:44am EDT","EU competition chief to examine Amazon, Hachette e-book spat",http://www.reuters.com//article/eu-amazoncom-competition-idUSL6N0OM2VJ20140605?type=companyNews
193,"   By Deepa Seetharaman | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Amazon.com Inc will start managing subscription payments for start-ups and other companies - the latest in a series of quiet moves the e-commerce giant has made into PayPal's turf over the past year.The service, which launches on Monday, allows the company's more than 240 million active users to use credit card details stored on Amazon.com to pay for services such as a monthly phone bill or a digital music subscription. Amazon then charges a fee on each transaction. EBay Inc's PayPal has long dominated online payments services but Amazon sees plenty of scope to push into new areas.The new service broadens Amazon's profitable role as a middleman for third-party sellers, which account for 40 percent of its sales and extends its influence beyond its website. It also comes ahead of June 18 unveiling by Chief Executive Jeff Bezos of what is widely expected to be a smartphone key to expanding Amazon's role in mobile payments. ""You should see it as one of many things that we'll do to expand where people might think about Amazon helping them,"" Amazon vice president of seller services Tom Taylor said in an interview.Amazon has been testing the new service over the last several months with start-ups including Ting, a mobile phone company that is part of Tucows Inc. Those who used recurring payments by Amazon spent 30 percent more on Ting's website, product manager Justen Burdette said in an interview arranged by Amazon. Some analysts have said Amazon has been held back in payments because merchants are wary of handing over customer data to the company, which has a record of rapidly expanding into new areas and competing with sellers.But Taylor said the only details collected by Amazon as part of the new service is the dollar amount of each transaction and not any ""item-level information.""He added that the service would encourage Amazon users who might otherwise be leery of handing over their credit card details to a fledgling companies to try out them out. ""If you think about giving a merchant that you may not know very well the right to continue to charge your credit card in the future, you really want to know that a good relationship with Amazon stands behind that,"" Taylor said.""We hope whoever the next Spotify out there is thinking about Amazon,"" he added, referring to the privately held, popular digital music subscription service.

197,"  MANAUS Brazil The tactical approaches of England and Italy's wily coaches Roy Hodgson and Cesare Prandelli will come under the microscope with the oppressive atmosphere of the Amazon rainforest providing the backdrop for a Group D clash on Saturday.  The contrasting qualities of youth and experience will compete to tame Manaus's punishing jungle humidity as a fresh-faced England, largely unburdened by past failures, play a wizened Italy, with a squad still imbued with their 2006 World Cup success. England, whose qualifying campaign was underpinned by Hodgson's natural caution, look set to put their faith in a pack of attacking youngsters with only a handful of caps between them but with energy in abundance and plenty of hard running in the tank.Italy, by contrast, still revolve around midfield metronome Andrea Pirlo, a veteran of their final victory over France eight years ago, to set the tempo for a possession game where the ball is jealously guarded and energy conserved rather than expended. Pirlo is one of three current Italy players with World Cup winners' medals along with 36-year-old goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon and 30-year-old midfielder Daniele De Rossi.Italy's legacy of success, having reached the final in two of their last four major tournaments as well as a semi-final appearance at last year's Confederations Cup, contrasts strikingly with England's record of persistently flattering to deceive. Yet one advantage of England's new-look side is there will be no hangover from 2010 where they exited the World Cup in a 4-1 last-16 defeat to Germany. Captain Steven Gerrard, right back Glen Johnson and striker Wayne Rooney are the only likely starters on Saturday to have survived that dismal performance. With Hodgson dropping hints that he could include Liverpool's 19-year-old trickster Raheem Sterling in a forward line that is set to feature relative international novices Daniel Sturridge and Adam Lallana, England are looking to the future rather than the past. The fact that expectation levels are at a low ebb could also work in favor of a side that retains enormous attacking potential. ""It's probably the best squad I've been involved in so it's great to be a part of. I am looking forward to this tournament and the future with England because it certainly looks bright,"" Rooney told reporters earlier this week.England lost to Italy on penalties in the quarter-finals of the European Championship two years ago and the Italians are strongly favored to emerge from a tough group that also includes Uruguay and Costa Rica.There is no lack of confidence in the camp with open talk of another run to the final. ""We can win the World Cup,"" said Pirlo earlier in the week. ""I always play to win and I won’t be satisfied by just getting out of the group stage or into the quarter-finals."" ""This Italy team has everything it needs to go all the way."" Perhaps the difference between England and Italy is that none of Hodgson's men could utter that prediction without it being greeted by laughter.

But we have prepared for this game to win and are confident that we have all the ingredients required to come out on top in what should be a pulsating clash,"" Prandelli said.“We have seen lots of goals in the opening few games and I believe this will be the tournament’s trend.

Prandelli was asked why goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon, one of three Italian players in the squad who won the 2006 World Cup, finished practice early.“He twisted his ankle very, very lightly and came off only as a precaution, meaning that he will definitely start tomorrow,” he said. The other survivors from 2006 are defensive midfielder Daniele De Rossi and playmaker Andrea Pirlo who is expected to pull the strings and carve out the supply routes for Mario Balotelli and Antonio Cassano.“Pirlo is the incarnation of the Italian team spirit because he is still as enthusiastic as he was on his first international appearance and he has more than a 100 caps for the national team,"" Prandelli said.“He leads by example and shows in every training session that he still wants to be the symbol of this team.”  Commenting on England captain Steven Gerrard’s remarks that the English had a stronger squad and a better team than the Italians, Prandelli said; “Everybody thinks they are the bigger team and naturally England also have every reason to be confident because they have so much depth and their forwards are very apt at creating and using space.“Controlling the midfield will be the key and what I am looking for from my team is 90 minutes of intelligent football played at a steady pace because nothing less will do against such a strong rival.”  (Editing by Ed Osmond)",2014-06-14,AMZN,"Fri Jun 13, 2014 | 10:21pm EDT","Italy's Prandelli happy with pitch, wary of different England",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-soccer-world-m8-ita-idUSKBN0EP04L20140614?type=companyNews
202,"   By Zoran Milosavljevic | MANAUS Brazil  MANAUS Brazil Cameroon's Indomitable Lions must improve on a toothless display in their opening match when they face Croatia in the hot and humid Amazon city of Manaus in Group A on Wednesday while having to cope with the loss of pack leader Samuel Eto’o.The four-time African Footballer of the Year has been ruled out of the clash due to a knee injury.Cameroon, who lost 1-0 against Mexico in their opener, are seeking their first World Cup win since 2002.Their next opponents Croatia, who have failed to reach the knockout stage since an impressive third-place finish in 1998, are also fighting for survival after losing their opener 3-1 against Brazil.Croatia have their own problems as inspirational playmaker Luka Modric faces a race against time to recover from a foot injury he sustained in that match.Coach Niko Kovac was confident he would have Modric available and welcomed the return of suspended striker Mario Madzukic, who will reclaim his spot from Nikica Jelavic to lead the line in a 4-2-3-1 formation.“Modric is getting better and I think he will be fit to play while having Mandzukic back is a real bonus because he is aggressive and able to pull the whole team forward,” Kovac told reporters in the team’s Praia do Forte base. “His approach can scare Cameroon and help Croatia.”LOWER EXPECTATIONS  Initial outbursts over a contentious penalty to Brazil with the score 1-1 quickly gave way to pundits’ criticism of Kovac’s tactics as Croatia sat back after taking an early lead and the 42-year old coach promised a more adventurous strategy against the Cameroonians. “It was hard to come forward against Brazil but this game will be a different story because I expect us to have more possession and dominate,"" he said.“Purposeful running will be the key because of the weather. As we saw in a high-tempo England v Italy game and one of superb quality, both sides wilted after 70 minutes in the unbearable heat.“It won’t be the end of the world if we don’t get past the group stage but I want to think positively and believe that we can make an impact.  ""We have to remember that we are a small nation that scraped through to the finals, but I can still see the light at the end of the tunnel.Cameroon’s  German coach Volker Finke was tight-lipped about his team’s prospects of rekindling some of the past glory, by the looks of things a big ask from a modest outfit lacking the guile and creativity of the side that stormed into the last eight in 1990.Instead, he heaped praise on his rivals.“Croatia is a team that has good players. There are players who play at clubs in Spain, at Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, in the Bundesliga ... it is clear that this is a good team,” he said. ""They are in the same situation as us, they lost their opener. If you have zero points after the first game, you do not talk too much, you just have to win at all costs.”  (Writing by Zoran Milosavljevic; additional reporting by Mark Gleeson, Editing by Nigel Hunt)",2014-06-16,AMZN,"Mon Jun 16, 2014 | 3:06pm EDT",Wounded lions headed for survival clash in Amazon,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-soccer-world-m18-cmr-cro-preview-idUSKBN0ER2I820140616?type=companyNews
203,"   By Jonathan Stempel  Fifty Sherlock Holmes works published before 1923 by Arthur Conan Doyle are in the public domain, a U.S. appeals court said on Monday, and others may refer to them freely without paying licensing fees to the Scottish writer's estate.The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago said U.S. copyright law did not cover earlier works depicting the brilliant detective, including references to Holmes, his sidekick Dr. Watson, his arch-enemy Professor Moriarty, 221B Baker Street, and even Holmes' cocaine use.Writing for a three-judge panel, Circuit Judge Richard Posner said there was no basis to extend U.S. copyrights beyond their expiration.He said only Conan Doyle's last 10 Holmes works, which were published between 1923 and 1927 and have copyrights expiring after 95 years, deserved protection. Conan Doyle died in 1930.""When a story falls into the public domain, story elements - including characters covered by the expired copyright - become fair game for follow-on authors,"" Posner wrote.To rule for the estate, he said, would encourage authors to write more stories with old characters. ""The effect would be to discourage creativity,"" he wrote. The decision was a victory for Leslie Klinger, editor of ""The New Annotated Sherlock Holmes"" and other Holmes books.Klinger had paid the estate a $5,000 licensing fee for a prior work but sued after refusing to pay another fee for a compendium of new Holmes stories that he and co-editor Laurie King were editing, ""In the Company of Sherlock Holmes.""Their publisher Pegasus Books, refused to publish the work after the Conan Doyle estate threatened to stop sales by Amazon.com Inc and Barnes & Noble Inc unless it received another fee.

""The urge to publish more comes from the love for the first 60 stories, and people should be encouraged to create more."" He said he hoped to publish the compendium in November.Benjamin Allison, a lawyer for the Conan Doyle estate, said no decision has been made on an appeal and that it remained to be seen how Klinger and others can use the author's characters without using the ""full expression"" of those characters. The last 10 Holmes works introduced such details as Watson's second wife and Holmes' retirement from his detective agency.""Many aspects of Holmes' character, such as his growing friendship with Watson and his human warmth, were created in the last 10 stories and remain protected by copyright,"" Allison said in an interview.Jonathan Kirsch, a lawyer for Klinger, said he was gratified by the decision.

206,"   By Alan Baldwin | CURITIBA Brazil  CURITIBA Brazil Not every foreign football fan at the World Cup is set on following their national team around Brazil, from the depths of the Amazon rainforest to the concrete jungle of Sao Paulo and beaches of Rio de Janeiro.Some, having made the long trip, are quite happy to watch in bars or on big screens miles from the action or turn up at stadiums where completely different teams are playing.Just being in the spiritual home of soccer during the tournament is sufficient.""Each game is in a different city so its sometimes very hard to catch matches,"" Australian-based Iran supporter Farshid Hadifar told Reuters before his side played Nigeria in Curitiba on Monday.He will watch Iran against Argentina in Belo Horizonte but not against Bosnia in Salvador.""I'm planning to attend Spain-Chile in Rio. I will be waving the Australian flag,"" smiled the Kermanshah-born chicken farm manager from Adelaide. Australia are in the same Group as champions Spain.The World Cup has always been as much about a sense of adventure, fans having a good time abroad and making new friends in unfamiliar lands as it has been about the serious sporting element. Brazil, with vast distances between some of the venues and airports creaking with the strain of fans criss-crossing the country, offers something for everyone.A week in Rio, taking in the sights from Corcovado Hill and mixing the sands of Copacabana with a match at the Maracana, may be more attractive than flying to remote Cuiaba or quiet Curitiba even if your team is playing there.Guido Wigert, an inspector for the federal office of civil aviation in Zurich, was looking slightly lost last Sunday as he wandered around the Curitiba stadium with a small group of friends wearing Swiss soccer shirts.They were looking for the official FIFA fan zone, in a park several kilometers away from the stadium, in the hope of seeing Switzerland play Ecuador in the capital Brasilia, more than 1,000km away. ""We won't see Switzerland play live. For me, that's not very important. It's the atmosphere,"" he said.Wigert explained that he, like a good many foreign fans, had decided the details of their trip back in September before the finals draw took place.""We have friends in Sao Paulo and we said we want not to fly too long distance and we rather prefer the south than the north because the distances are too long,"" he explained. The draw in November also handed Switzerland games in  Salvador in the north-east and steamy Manaus on the banks of the Amazon, but not in Curitiba - one of Brazil's more European cities with large Polish and Ukrainian communities.""We will see Spain v Chile, Holland v Chile (in Sao Paulo) and South Korea v Algeria (in Porto Alegre),"" said Wigert, who also followed Switzerland to South Africa for the previous World Cup in 2010.At least he was in Curitiba by design rather than by accident.Globo TV last week reported the tale of the Chilean fan who arrived in Curitiba ahead of Chile's opening match against Australia in Cuiaba - a difference of just a few letters but 1,700km by car.He may have made a mistake. But then again, he may just have been enjoying the trip.

209,"   By Deepa Seetharaman | SEATTLE  SEATTLE Amazon.com Inc's (AMZN.O) new cellphone seeks to offer shoppers instant gratification by recognizing thousands of products, television shows and songs and allowing users to immediately buy them - on the e-commerce giant's own site, of course. The smartphone, which joins Amazon's ""Fire"" lineup of tablets and streaming devices, aims to stand out in a crowded field dominated by Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Samsung Electronics (005930.KS). It represents an attempt to extend the company's dominance of online commerce into mobile phones, which are increasingly being used to buy items and view video.    But it's unclear how the phone's ""Firefly"" image- and audio-recognition feature or its much-touted 3D-perspectives will work in the real world, or how fickle consumers may respond to Amazon's latest bid to eliminate barriers to its core online retail business.Users can press a button and point the phone at an object such as a can of soup or work of art, or direct it to listen to a song. If the device recognizes it, the user can buy it on Amazon, if it's sold there.    The technology, which works by matching images of items or songs to Amazon's database of over 100 million items, will be opened to app-developers for use, an approach that rivals Apple and Google have taken with their own mobile software.     Amazon Chief Executive Jeff Bezos, in a rare media appearance in Seattle, demonstrated three-dimensional display features on the 4.7-inch phone, such as greater depth perception in maps and pictures.Four front-facing cameras track head movements and shift perspectives depending on a user's activity. Users can scroll through screens by tilting or swiveling the phone.""One of the things that Amazon tried to do with this phone is reduce the amount of activity and input that users have to do to get results,"" said Dave Cotter, chief executive of SquareHub, an app that helps families share photos and other information. ""Instead of clicking a whole bunch of stuff, you hold the phone and it does things for you,"" said the former Amazon executive, who got his first peek at the phone more than two months ago. Shares of Amazon climbed 2.7 percent to $334.38 on Wednesday.Still, the smartphone represents unfamiliar territory for Amazon. Apple and Samsung now dominate the market, having pushed names like Motorola and Nokia to the sidelines. Some may balk at the price. Industry insiders had expected the Fire phone to be far cheaper than iPhones or Galaxy devices, given Amazon sold its Fire tablets at cost.Amazon is selling the Fire phone for $649 contract-free. From July 25, a 32-GB version will go for $199.99 with a contract on AT&T Inc (T.N).

Google Inc makes Android, the mobile operating system used in more than a billion phones and tablets. The apps will become available after the Canadian smartphone maker rolls out the upgraded BlackBerry 10.3 operating system, the company said.The move is the latest by the smartphone pioneer to streamline its focus as it attempts to reinvent itself under new Chief Executive Officer John Chen as BlackBerry phones have lost ground to Apple Inc's iPhone and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd's Galaxy devices.Analysts saw the move as a step in the right direction, but are not sure whether it will help turn the tide for BlackBerry. ""While this will widen the BB10 app ecosystem, the consumersmartphone environment still remains challenging,"" Wells Fargo analyst Maynard Um said in a note to clients. Um views the announcement as a positive for BlackBerry, but said ""whether it stems consumer churn remains to be seen.""Chen wants to remain a competitor in the smartphone segment, but is focused on making BlackBerry a dominant force in machine-to-machine communications. The company's QNX software already is a mainstay in the automotive industry, powering electronic and other systems in a wide range of cars. BlackBerry already works with hundreds of large enterprise clients, including corporations and government agencies, to manage and secure mobile devices on their internal networks. Chen intends to build on those ties and BlackBerry's security credentials to let these enterprise clients build and customize in-house corporate and productivity applications for their employees. Last week, BlackBerry announced a deal with EnStream LP, a mobile payments joint venture owned by Canada's three large wireless carriers, to provide a secure platform for transactions between banks and consumers.   These moves, coupled with others made by Chen, including a much cheered move to forge an alliance with device manufacturing giant Foxconn Technology Co, have made analysts more optimistic about BlackBerry's prospects.

216,"   By Deepa Seetharaman | SEATTLE  SEATTLE Amazon.com Inc's (AMZN.O) newest mobile device, a smartphone that may sport a 3D screen, is the retailer's latest attempt to exert its influence over the way consumers shop online.Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos will preside over a mystery launch on Wednesday near its Seattle campus. Industry observers predict the arrival of a long-rumored smartphone after years of development.It is unclear if a 3D display, as widely reported, is enough to help the new entree stand out in a crowded field dominated by Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) seven-year-old iPhone and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS) Galaxy devices. Three-quarters of U.S. consumers online already own a smartphone, according to online data tracking service comScore.But its introduction reflects how smartphones and tablets are fast becoming how many consumers view and buy items online. Mobile commerce grew at almost twice the rate of online retail during the first quarter, according to comScore.Analysts said Amazon has more opportunities outside the United States. Only 30 percent of the 5.2 billion phones on the market are smartphones, Topeka Capital Markets analyst Victor Anthony said in a June 5 research note. ""As the world shifts toward mobile, how do you make sure Amazon is front and center?"" Jefferson Wang, senior partner at IBB Consulting, said in an interview.Two sources have said the device contains 3D features visible to the eye without special glasses. Analysts expect Amazon's Prime membership program, which offers features such as movie streaming and two-day delivery, to be tied to the phone. A phone would represent yet another new area for Amazon, which got its start selling books and has since expanded into everything from original television shows to grocery delivery. It could also boost adoption of an Amazon payments platform. On Tuesday, the Wall Street Journal reported AT&T Inc (T.N) would carry the smartphone exclusively, as it did the iPhone for years and a short-lived Facebook (FB.O) phone made by HTC Corp (2498.TW) that at one point was discounted to 99 cents.""Let's hope @amazon doesn't fall victim to the @att curse that is the facebook phone,"" T-Mobile CEO John Legere tweeted. A phone would be the third new device Amazon has introduced this year after its FireTV streaming video device and Dash grocery-ordering wand. In recent years, the company has moved more aggressively into hardware, selling its devices at cost in hopes of spurring purchases on Amazon's website.It has also used its devices to test emerging markets. This year, Amazon began selling the Kindle online in Brazil after years of selling the device in stores. The move gives Amazon a chance to work through some of the country's logistics problems.

We're happy and so we want you to be happy too!"" said Matheus Pinto, 24, wearing a Brazil scarf over his working garb as he tapped out some samba on the back of a truck near Liberty Square in central Belo Horizonte. ""This is the land of music and soccer!""Foreign fans had been expressing disappointment at the lack of World Cup color in the city - a conventional state capital and business center. So there has been general delight when the binmen come out and do their stuff. ""It's fantastic. This place is, frankly, rather boring. But these guys are hilarious,"" said Andres Ortiz, 39, a businessman in town with friends for the Argentina v Iran game on Saturday.The Belo Horizonte binmen were perhaps inspired by Rio de Janeiro street sweeper Renato Sorisso, who became famous as a samba dancer at carnival. (tinyurl.com/kvoocap) Perhaps not to be outdone, some binmen from England, a nation less known for its skill in tropical rhythms, have also been taking to the streets to wow the public with some samba World Cup dancing.

219,"   By Deepa Seetharaman | SEATTLE  SEATTLE Amazon.com Inc's (AMZN.O) new cellphone seeks to offer shoppers instant gratification by recognizing thousands of products, television shows and songs and allowing users to immediately buy them - on the e-commerce giant's own site, of course. The smartphone, which joins Amazon's ""Fire"" lineup of tablets and streaming devices, aims to stand out in a crowded field dominated by Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Samsung Electronics (005930.KS). It represents an attempt to extend the company's dominance of online commerce into mobile phones, which are increasingly being used to buy items and view video.    But it's unclear how the phone's ""Firefly"" image- and audio-recognition feature or its much-touted 3D-perspectives will work in the real world, or how fickle consumers may respond to Amazon's latest bid to eliminate barriers to its core online retail business.Users can press a button and point the phone at an object such as a can of soup or work of art, or direct it to listen to a song. If the device recognizes it, the user can buy it on Amazon, if it's sold there.    The technology, which works by matching images of items or songs to Amazon's database of over 100 million items, will be opened to app-developers for use, an approach that rivals Apple and Google have taken with their own mobile software.     Amazon Chief Executive Jeff Bezos, in a rare media appearance in Seattle, demonstrated three-dimensional display features on the 4.7-inch phone, such as greater depth perception in maps and pictures.Four front-facing cameras track head movements and shift perspectives depending on a user's activity. Users can scroll through screens by tilting or swiveling the phone.""One of the things that Amazon tried to do with this phone is reduce the amount of activity and input that users have to do to get results,"" said Dave Cotter, chief executive of SquareHub, an app that helps families share photos and other information. ""Instead of clicking a whole bunch of stuff, you hold the phone and it does things for you,"" said the former Amazon executive, who got his first peek at the phone more than two months ago. Shares of Amazon climbed 2.7 percent to $334.38 on Wednesday.Still, the smartphone represents unfamiliar territory for Amazon. Apple and Samsung now dominate the market, having pushed names like Motorola and Nokia to the sidelines. Some may balk at the price. Industry insiders had expected the Fire phone to be far cheaper than iPhones or Galaxy devices, given Amazon sold its Fire tablets at cost.Amazon is selling the Fire phone for $649 contract-free. From July 25, a 32-GB version will go for $199.99 with a contract on AT&T Inc (T.N). Those prices are comparable to the iPhone 5C's, though it has superior displays and other features.To sweeten the deal, Amazon offered 12 months of membership to Prime, its two-day delivery and streaming service.

225,"  (Adds company comment, stock price)BRASILIA, June 26 A federal court has revoked the environmental license for a large gold mine planned by Belo Sun Mining Corp on the Xingu River in the Amazon, ruling that the company had failed to assess the impact on local indigenous communities.The ruling published on Tuesday can be appealed. Belo Sun's stock fell 7 percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange to 19 Canadian cents.""This is an important victory for justice. It can still go to an appeals court, but we think it will be difficult to overturn,"" said Helena Palmquist, a spokeswoman for the federal prosecutors office in the northern state of Para.The Volta Grande, or Big Bend, open-pit project is slated to start operating in 2016 and become Brazil's largest gold mine. It is next to another controversial project, Belo Monte, which is designed to become the worlds third largest hydroelectric dam and has also been the target of lawsuits by prosecutors. Belo Sun could not immediately be reached for comment, but the Toronto-based company said in a news release that a federal judge in Para had ruled that the company needed to complete an indigenous study for its preliminary license to be valid.To this end, Belo Sun said it had engaged a local environmental consultancy in January to carry out the study and is waiting for government approval, which it expects shortly, to be able to access indigenous lands. Belo Sun expects the study will take five months. Judge Claudio Henrique de Pina said it was ""unquestionable"" that the mine would have a ""negative and irreversible"" impact on the quality of life and cultural heritage of the Paquiçamba, Arara da Volta Grande and Ituna/Itatá indigenous communities that straddle the Xingu river.The licensing process for the mine cannot go ahead without studying the impact on the local communities that are already being affected by the Belo Monte dam, he ruled, agreeing with environmentalists who say the double impact of the two massive projects on the Indians' habitat has not been properly studied. Brazil's federal Indian affairs agency, Funai, said in December that the biggest impact on the Indian communities that live along a 100-km (60-mile) stretch of the river will be a drop in water flows by 80 percent to 90 percent when the Belo Monte dam starts up.Belo Sun, a small company with a market value of about C$50 million ($46.07 million), estimates average production of 313,100 ounces of gold per year over a mine life of 10 years, with production starting in early 2016, according to a pre-feasibility study published in May.The study found that 2.8 million ounces of its estimated 4.7 million ounces of measured and indicated gold resources were economically viable reserves, but it said recent exploration work could boost reserves and extend the life of the mine.

228,"  BRASILIA, June 26 A federal court has revoked the environmental license for a massive gold mine planned by Belo Sun Mining Corp on the Xingu River in the Amazon, ruling that the company had failed to assess the impact on local indigenous communities.The ruling published on Tuesday can be appealed.""This is an important victory for justice. It can still go to an appeals court, but we think it will be difficult to overturn,"" said Helena Palmquist, a spokeswoman for the federal prosecutors office in the northern state of Para.The Volta Grande, or Big Bend, open-pit project is slated to start operating in 2016 and become Brazil's largest gold mine. It is next to another controversial project, Belo Monte, which is designed to become the worlds third largest hydroelectric dam and has also been the target of lawsuits by prosecutors. Judge Claudio Henrique de Pina said it was ""unquestionable"" that the mine would have a ""negative and irreversible"" impact on the quality of life and cultural heritage of the Paquiçamba, Arara da Volta Grande and Ituna/Itatá indigenous communities that straddle the Xingu river. The licensing process for the mine cannot go ahead without studying the impact on the local communities that are already being affected by the Belo Monte dam, he ruled, agreeing with environmentalists who say the double impact of the two massive projects on the Indians' habitat has not been properly studied.Brazil's federal Indian affairs agency, Funai, said in December that the biggest impact on the Indian communities that live along a 100-km (60-mile) stretch of the river will be a drop in water flows by 80 percent to 90 percent when the Belo Monte dam starts up. Belo Sun, based in Toronto, estimates average production of 313,100 ounces of gold per year over a mine life of 10 years, with production starting in early 2016, according to a pre-feasibility study published in May.The study found that 2.8 million ounces of its estimated 4.7 million ounces of measured and indicated gold resources were economically viable reserves, but it said recent exploration work could boost reserves and extend the life of the mine.

235,"   By Conrad de Aenlle | LONG BEACH Calif.  LONG BEACH Calif. (The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.)Many tech companies saw their high-flying stocks lose altitude this year. Leaders in social media like Twitter Inc. and LinkedIn Corp. fell more than 40 percent from their 2014 highs. Others, such as the retailer Amazon.com Inc., took more modest drops, although shareholders might not have found them modest at the time.These stocks, among others, are cheaper than they were, but are they cheap enough? They almost certainly can't be considered bargains by normal valuation yardsticks. Their price-earnings ratios – when there are earnings – can run close to or into triple digits.Portfolio managers find, however, that some businesses offer sufficient growth potential to warrant bets around current prices. Kevin Landis, manager of the Firsthand Technology Opportunities Fund, has been adding to his position in Twitter, a longtime holding, because he expects the stock to improve over the long haul as the company evolves from an upstart held in tech portfolios into a respectable blue chip that will be far more widely owned.""It's only a matter of time before Twitter goes into the S&P 500,"" says Landis, a Silicon Valley investor since the days of CompuServe email addresses composed of long strings of numbers. ""Like Google 10 years ago or Facebook two years ago, everyone will have to own them.""The reason that Twitter plunged in the first place, losing more than half its value, is that investors pulled back ahead of anticipated selling by corporate insiders. Many feared a massive dumping of Twitter stock once the lock-up period from the company's November initial public offering ended. That has abated, Landis says, and the stock ""really looks like it has found a bottom.""Landis also holds Google Inc. along with Facebook Inc., which has nearly quadruped in value since late 2008, but he's having reservations about the latter. Landis questions how much growth potential Facebook has left and warns that he may sell before the year is out. ""I'm still happy to hold it, but at over $160 billion [in market value], how much can it possibly make in the next 10 years?"" he wonders. ""I don't know that we'll hold it forever.""Landis has no such misgivings about LinkedIn, a social-media company for professionals. He remained invested through the recent plunge and believes that the stock is worth buying today.""We own it and would consider adding to it,"" he says. ""It's a top brand. It's hard to imagine a scenario where LinkedIn fades from view."" The $110 million Firsthand Technology Opportunity is up an annualized 20 percent in the five years through June 27, according to Lipper, a unit of Thomson Reuters. The fund has an expense ratio of 1.85 percent.John Toohey, head of equities for USAA Investments, which offers the $571 million USAA Science & Technology Fund, has similar opinions about Facebook and LinkedIn, only reversed. Facebook, a holding in several USAA portfolios, including Science & Technology, is the one with the greater growth potential, in his view, because its everyman customers are more tolerant of having ads thrust in their faces than the professionals who use LinkedIn. ""They have huge opportunities to monetize their base,"" Toohey says about Facebook. Still, he encourages the company not to be greedy by saturating the site with ads or allowing ads that are targeted so precisely to users that it becomes obvious just how much information the company has on them.""People are fine being marketed to,"" Toohey says, ""but they need to strike a delicate balance.""AMAZON'S BALANCING ACT  Amazon.com, whose stock fell more than 25 percent earlier in the year, may need to execute a balancing act of its own. Amazon has spared little expense in growing its business to become a dominant retailer, but companies that spare little expense tend to have thin profit margins and generate anemic cash flow, Toohey notes. USAA Science & Technology delivered an annualized return of 21 percent in the past five years. The fund's expense ratio is 1.34 percent.""We own some Amazon, but we're cautious about it,"" he says. ""The challenge is whether they'll ever slow down spending to ramp up cash flow and margins.""Another possible impediment to Amazon and its shareholders is that it sends out so many packages at such short notice that delivery services like FedEx Corp. and United Parcel Service Inc. eventually may balk at doing the heavy lifting, at least at current prices.""Amazon could shoot themselves in the foot,"" Toohey warns. ""If FedEx and UPS are going to be able to support all that volume with two days' notice, they'll have to hire people and do logistics. Are they going to get paid for it?""Prospective buyers of tech high fliers may be asking themselves the same question. Recalling the 2000 crash, Landis concedes that investors can get hurt in companies like these, but he highlights a difference between now and then – a dearth of opportunities for growth in other assets.""After a long bull market, there's nothing to go back to,"" he says. ""When people take money off the table and look around, they see that gold is played out, at least for now; there's not much [to make] in bonds, and stocks of old-guard companies aren't growing that fast.

Vitacost has reported losses for the past 15 quarters and had an annual revenue of $382.7 million in 2013.Vitacost sells vitamins, herbs, supplements, sports nutrition and beauty care products and organic foods to about 2.3 million active customers, Kroger said.Kroger said it would use Vitacost to enter new markets and new channels, along with its Harris Teeter's online order and pick-up service.    Kroger completed the purchase of North Carolina-based Harris Teeter Supermarkets for about $2.5 billion on Jan. 28, adding more than 200 supermarkets to its network. For supermarket operators like Kroger, home deliveries of groceries and personal care products is becoming more important as customers increasingly prefer to buy everyday items online.Wal-Mart Stores Inc last month unveiled aggressive plans to integrate e-commerce with its sprawling network of brick-and-mortar stores, and also appointed a head of its online business. Wal-Mart reported online sales of $10 billion in 2013, less than 3 percent of overall sales. Ecommerce behemoth Amazon.com Inc had online sales of $67.85 billion in 2013 with 25.8 percent of the online market share in the United States.Kroger's shares had closed at $49.53 on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday.

Verdi has organised several stoppages over the past year to push Amazon to raise pay for logistics workers, demands Amazon has repeatedly rejected. Verdi has also supported workers striking at a French distribution centre near Lyon.Amazon is planning to build three new logistics centres in Poland and two in the Czech Republic, prompting speculation that it could seek to shift work across the border from strike-hit centres in Germany.Verdi is not immediately concerned about that threat, as delivering from outside Germany would be slower for Amazon, but could coordinate action with union colleagues in Poland and Czech Republic if it comes to that, the spokeswoman said.

248,"   By Alister Doyle | OSLO  OSLO Swathes of the Amazon may have been grassland until a natural shift to a wetter climate about 2,000 years ago let the rainforests form, according to a study that challenges common belief that the world’s biggest tropical forest is far older.    The arrival of European diseases after Columbus crossed the Atlantic in 1492 may also have hastened the growth of forests by killing indigenous people farming the region, the scientists wrote in the U.S. journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).    ""The dominant ecosystem was more like a savannah than the rainforest we see today,"" John Carson, lead author at the University of Reading in England, said of the findings about the southern Amazon.    The scientists said that a shift toward wetter conditions, perhaps caused by natural shifts in the Earth’s orbit around the sun, led to growth of more trees starting about 2,000 years ago.   The scientists studied man-made earthworks, uncovered by recent logging in Bolivia, that included ditches up to about a kilometer (1,100 yards) long and up to 3 meters deep and 4 meters wide.    They found large amounts of grass pollen in ancient sediments of nearby lakes, suggesting the region had been covered by savannah. They also found evidence of plantings of maize, pointing to farming.     PRISTINE     The Amazon has traditionally been seen as a pristine, dense rainforest, populated by hunter-gatherers. In recent years, however, archaeologists have found hints that indigenous peoples lived in the thick forest, but managed to clear tracts of land for farming.    The PNAS study suggests a new idea – that the forest simply did not exist in some regions.  The ""findings suggest that rather than being rainforest hunter-gatherers, or large-scale forest clearers, the people of the Amazon from 2,500 to 500 years ago were farmers,"" the University of Reading said in a statement.     Carson said that perhaps a fifth of the Amazon basin, in the south, may have been savannah until the shift, with forests covering the rest.     In one lake, Laguna Granja, rainforest plants only took over from grass as the main sources of pollen in sediments about 500 years old, suggesting a link to the arrival of Europeans.    The purpose of the earthworks is unknown - they could have been defensive or for drainage or religious purposes.     And understanding the forest could help solve puzzles about climate change.    The Amazon rainforest affects climate change because trees soak up heat-trapping carbon dioxide as they grow and release it when they rot or are burnt. Brazil has sharply slowed deforestation rates in recent years.    Carson said that the growth of Amazonian forests could, for instance, have contributed to the Little Ice Age, from about 1350 to 1850 by absorbing heat-trapping gases from the air.    Michael Heckenberger, an expert on the Amazon at the University of Florida, said the study added to evidence that people living in the Amazon managed nature.    ""These indigenous systems were highly sophisticated...There are over 80 domesticated or semi-domesticated crops in the Amazon,"" he said. ""In Europe at the time they were working with about six.""

249,"   By Emma Thomasson | BERLIN  BERLIN Big retailers are taking a calculated hit to margins to invest in online grocery operations, in the hope they can persuade consumers to add more profitable items like clothes and computers to their orders of fruit and vegetables.Food has been one of the last things to move online because complex logistics for fresh, chilled and frozen products make it an expensive business. Retailers are also reluctant to lose the potential for the lucrative impulse buys that occur in-store.However, retailers in Europe and North America are now ramping up their online food offer to compete with Amazon.com, which is expected to expand its sale of fresh produce beyond a few trial areas with the aim of complementing its non-food sales - and eating other retailers' lunch.""They are trying to hook customers up to brands for their grocery shop and hope they will spend on non-food which is lower headache and higher margin, which will drive profitability,"" said Sophie Albizua of retail consultancy eNova Partnership. ""It is notoriously difficult to make money selling groceries online. The reason why people do it and need to do it have nothing to do with profit and nothing to do with groceries.""Britain has led the way in selling groceries online, with e-commerce already accounting for some 5 percent of food sales. Other countries like France are now catching up and the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) predicts the global market will grow to $100 billion by 2018 from $36 billion in 2013. ""COMPELLING ECONOMICS"" It has taken Tesco, Europe's second biggest retailer, 17 years to bring its online grocery business close to the industry-leading margins it used to make in its store business.Tesco made a trading profit of 127 million pounds ($216 million) on online grocery sales of 2.5 billion pounds in 2013, equal to an operating margin of around 5 percent. That beat the 3.7 percent Tesco reported for the group in 2013 - after it was hit by restructuring costs - but came in below group margin at or above 6 percent for the previous three years.Some analysts suggest that Tesco should focus less on investment in costly e-commerce technology and logistics and more on cutting prices if it wants to stop losing market share in Britain to German discounters Aldi and Lidl.But Tesco says it is not building its online business for the sake of it: The aim rather is to attract more big-spending food shoppers who also buy general goods, which traditionally sell at much higher margins than groceries.Tesco customers who buy food online as well as in store spend twice as much as those who only shop in store. Those who also buy general merchandise spend three times as much - although only 4 percent of customers are currently in that last category.Tesco, which still runs separate operations for online groceries and general merchandise, plans to combine its grocery and general goods deliveries - leveraging the sophisticated logistics network it has built up for food to cut costs for the company, and offer customers a faster service.The one-hour delivery slots that Tesco offers seven days a week for grocery orders are unmatched by any other general merchandise retailer, including Amazon, points out Tesco multichannel director Robin Terrell. ""As we start to add additional items or additional products to each of those deliveries, the economics become incredibly compelling for us but also a much more compelling offer for customers,"" Terrell said.It's a service that would make customers take notice, said Helen Merriott, head of consultancy Accenture's retail practice in Britain.""If they could combine food and non-food and do that in a really efficient way, using their own supply chain in a joined-up way to get that to the customer when the customer wants it, it would be really powerful,"" Merriott said.SLIM MARGINS, SUPERIOR DELIVERY British retailer Ocado, on track to make its first annual pretax profit this year since it was founded in 2000, set up an online pet store last year from which customers now order goods alongside their food, and plans a kitchen and homeware online store later this year.Ocado said last week over 30 percent of its orders now contain at least one non-food item as customers benefit from the convenience of the firm's one-hour delivery slots. Deutsche Bank analysts Niamh McSherry and James Collins predict that general merchandise will grow to 9 percent of Ocado's sales by 2023 from about 3 percent today.""This is key for the Ocado investment case, namely because it could support the profitability of grocery online retailing and thereby facilitate further penetration of the grocery market,"" they wrote in a note.Dutch retailer Ahold, which runs U.S. online grocer Peapod as well as sites for groceries and general goods in the Netherlands and Belgium, is another that plans to keep investing in e-commerce despite the hit to profitability.In the first quarter, online sales for all Ahold's e-commerce sites grew 20 percent to 362 million euros ($493.79 million), while the group's underlying operating margin slipped to 4 percent from 4.1 percent a year ago. Its online grocery businesses have yet to break even but its Bol.com general merchandise site made an unspecified profit in 2013.Ahold is using its network of supermarkets as pick-up points for non-food online orders from sister firm Bol.com in the same way that Waitrose in Britain does with partner John Lewis[JLPLC.UL].Britain's Asda is also investing in collection points, including in car parks of London tube stations, garnering useful information for its owner Wal-Mart, which is testing online grocery in its home market as part of a bigger plan to integrate e-commerce into its sprawling network of stores.The world's biggest retailer, which made more than $10 billion in e-commerce sales of non-food items last year, warns that investment in online will eat into profits this year. AMAZON ADVANCES Most of these traditional players are hoping to have established a bulkhead before Amazon expands its ""Fresh"" service, which is already combining deliveries of groceries and non-food orders in a few trial U.S. cities like its hometown Seattle.In areas where AmazonFresh is available, trucks are bundling orders of groceries with a pasta meal or fresh fish from local specialty stores Amazon is partnering with, as well as non-food items like digital cameras and video games.""Customers who are using our service are not just satisfying one shopping occasion but many shopping occasions,"" Doug Herrington, Amazon vice president consumables, told the Consumer Goods Forum industry summit in Paris last month.Bernstein Research predicts that AmazonFresh could generate an operating margin as high as 13 percent in denser urban areas once it overcomes logistical challenges to reach scale.""A roll out of Fresh could have a material positive impact on order frequency, loyalty, and spend in other non-grocery related categories,"" Bernstein analysts wrote in a recent report.Amazon's Herrington expects the pace of delivery will be his future battleground.""We have yet to find customers who are begging us for slower delivery,"" he said. ""They are going to demand a shorter and shorter window from when you purchase it to when it arrives in your home.""($1 = 0.5877 British Pounds)($1 = 0.7331 Euros)(Corrects spelling of Accenture's Merriott in paragraphs 15, 16) (Additional reporting by Martinne Geller and James Davey; Editing by Sophie Walker)",2014-07-09,AMZN,"Wed Jul 9, 2014 | 6:27am EDT",Retailers swallow online food cost to lock in shoppers,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-retail-internet-analysis-idUSKBN0FD1E320140709?type=companyNews
250,"   By Jonathan Stempel | NEW YORK, July 9  NEW YORK, July 9 The man accused of creating Silk Road, which U.S. authorities said was an online drug marketplace, lost his bid on Wednesday to dismiss a federal indictment accusing him of conspiring to deal illegal narcotics and launder money.Ross Ulbricht, who prosecutors said was known online as ""Dread Pirate Roberts,"" had claimed he did not conspire with Silk Road users who might have broken the law by completing transactions on the now-defunct website, using the digital currency bitcoin. He also claimed he was not involved in money laundering because bitcoins are not money.In a 51-page decision, U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest in Manhattan said, ""the design and operation"" of Silk Road and Ulbricht's role as an ""intermediary"" between website users justified letting prosecutors pursue their case.""The allegations amount to Ulbricht acting as a sort of 'godfather' - determining the territory, the actions which may be undertaken, and the commissions he will retain; disciplining others to stay in line, and generally casting himself as a leader,"" Forrest wrote. ""Whether the government can prove the facts alleged is not a question at this stage.""Forrest also said the federal money laundering statute encompasses bitcoins, noting that the virtual currency's value can be expressed in dollars. ""Any other reading would - in light of Bitcoin's' sole raison d'etre - be nonsensical,"" she said. ""One can money launder using Bitcoin."" Ulbricht, 29, faces four conspiracy counts, including engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise, narcotics trafficking, computer hacking and money laundering. The criminal enterprise count carries a maximum sentence of life in prison.A trial is scheduled for Nov. 3, court records showed. Ulbricht is in federal custody, following his arrest on Oct. 1 at a public library in San Francisco. Authorities shut down Silk Road shortly before the arrest.Joshua Dratel, a lawyer for Ulbricht, declined to comment, saying he had not yet reviewed the decision. In seeking to dismiss the indictment, Ulbricht said the government portrayed him as being, at most, a ""steerer"" or ""facilitator"" of alleged illegal conduct, not a co-conspirator.But the judge said the indictment went further, alleging that Silk Road was ""specifically and intentionally designed"" to create an ""expansive black market"" for drugs and malicious software and laundering money. She said the allegations, if true, would distinguish Silk Road from websites such as Amazon.com Inc and eBay Inc , which are intended for buyers and sellers to complete transactions lawfully.Individuals accessed Silk Road with an encryption program that allowed anonymous communications.On June 27, the U.S. Marshals Service auctioned 29,655 bitcoins, then valued at $17.7 million, seized from Silk Road.Bitcoins are transacted independent of central control, and not backed by any government or central bank.The case is U.S. v.

252,"   By Diane Bartz | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The U.S. government sued Amazon.com on Thursday for allowing children to collectively run up millions of dollars in purchases on the credit cards of their unsuspecting parents while playing mobile apps like ""Tap Zoo"" and ""Ice Age Village.""The lawsuit, filed by the Federal Trade Commission, seeks to make the online retailer refund money spent without parental permission and to end Amazon's practice of allowing purchases without requiring a password or other mechanism that gives parents control over their accounts.The unauthorized charges are often associated with children's apps, such as games, that can be free to download but allow players to make in-app purchases by buying ""coins"" or other digital products with the credit card associated with the device, the FTC said in its complaint.The FTC complaint cited ""Tap Zoo"" and ""Ice Age Village"" in which children manage a zoo or an ancient town. To do that, they can purchase digital items that often cost real money.    A user put a review on Amazon.com in July 2013 complaining that ""Tap Zoo"" was a ""cash trap"" and said his son spent $65 on it without permission.

256,"  (Adds details on overlooked shows, quotes from nominees)     By Mary Milliken and Eric Kelsey     LOS ANGELES, July 10 Television newcomers ""True Detective,"" a crime drama from HBO, and ""Orange is the New Black,"" a dark prison comedy from Netflix, racked up a dozen Emmy nominations each on Thursday in a challenge to stalwarts like ""Breaking Bad"" and ""Modern Family.""     Online streaming company Netflix Inc, the big disrupter of the Emmys last year, more than doubled its nominations for TV's highest honors to 31 this year. Its political thriller ""House of Cards,"" which stars Kevin Spacey and Robin Wright, earned 13 nods for its second season.     HBO's medieval thriller and fan favorite ""Game of Thrones"" received the most nominations - 19 - and pushed the premium cable service's overall nods to 99, the most of any network for the 14th year in a row.         While cable networks and Netflix fared well, the broadcast networks were once again shut out of the top competition, best drama. Last year's winner, AMC's gritty drug tale ""Breaking Bad,"" will compete for its final season, along with the network's ad world drama ""Mad Men,"" ""House of Cards,"" PBS's British period drama ""Downton Abbey,"" ""Game of Thrones"" and ""True Detective.""     ""It's a horse race between 'True Detective' and 'Breaking Bad,'"" said Cynthia Littleton, the TV editor-in-chief at trade publication Variety.      ""Homeland,"" a big winner in its first year, failed to snag a nomination in the best drama category despite good reviews for the Showtime domestic-terrorism tale in its third season. Claire Danes, who has won best lead actress for a drama for the last two years, was nominated again.           FILM STARS SHINE     ""True Detective,"" which follows a sadistic crime spree in rural Louisiana, earned best actor in a drama nominations for both Oscar winner Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson, two of the biggest film stars to move into the thriving television industry.     The co-stars and friends will also do battle with last year's surprise winner, Jeff Daniels from ""The Newsroom,"" as well as Spacey for his conniving congressman, Bryan Cranston for his final turn as the teacher-turned-drug dealer in ""Breaking Bad,"" and Jon Hamm, who plays brooding ad man Don Draper in ""Mad Men.     Hamm has been nominated seven times for his role in the series, which ends next year, but he has not won.      In another cross-over from film, FX's ""Fargo"" mini-series, based on the cult movie from the Coen brothers, notched up 18 nominations, including best actor in a mini-series nods for stars Billy Bob Thornton and Martin Freeman.     In the TV movie category, HBO's ""The Normal Heart,"" based on the true story of an early AIDS activist in New York City, earned 16 nods, including a best actor nomination for Mark Ruffalo and best supporting actress for Julia Roberts.            'QUALITY SELLS' FOR NETFLIX     Last year, Netflix received the first Emmy nominations for shows produced solely for the Internet.     The company has made original programming a priority to lure subscribers around the world, much like Time Warner Inc's  HBO. It has also spurred competition from the likes of Internet retailer Amazon.com Inc, which has had less success with its own forays into TV production.      ""There is such great television being made in the entire landscape of TV right now, but Netflix has an intense respect for the creative process, and they know that quality sells itself,"" ""House of Cards"" creator Beau Willimon told Reuters after the dawn nomination announcement.             Netflix's second big bet is ""Orange is the New Black,"" which is based on the real story of a woman who goes to prison on old drug charges. The nominations this year are for season one, although season two was made available all at once last month.      For the year's best comedy, ""Orange is the New Black"" will compete against ABC's ""Modern Family,"" which won last year. Rounding out the competitors are political satire ""Veep"" and tech-world take-down ""Silicon Valley,"" both from HBO; CBS nerd-fest ""The Big Bang Theory""; and the irreverent comedy ""Louie"" from FX.     Among the new faces in the lead actress categories were Taylor Schilling as the imprisoned Piper Chapman in ""Orange is the New Black"" and Lizzy Caplan as sex researcher Virginia Johnson in ""Masters of Sex.""     ""I am shocked and thrilled and shocked and really, really excited,"" said Caplan. ""Champagne before 6 a.m. is OK, right?""     The 66th Emmy Awards will be broadcast live from the Nokia Theatre in downtown Los Angeles on Aug. 25.

The company is developing drones that can fly at speeds of 50 miles per hour. Now Amazon is seeking permission to test drones in outdoor areas near Seattle, where one of its research and development labs is working on the technology, according to a letter posted on the Federal Aviation Administration's website on Thursday.Currently Amazon can test drones indoors and in other countries. But it cannot conduct R&D flight tests in open outdoor space in the state of Washington, where Amazon has its headquarters.

The FAA has allowed limited use of drones in the U.S. for surveillance, law enforcement, atmospheric research and other applications.

264,"  (Adds executives' comments)By Edwin ChanSAN FRANCISCO, July 16 EBay Inc posted a 13 percent rise in quarterly revenue on Wednesday, as better-than-expected results from its fast-growing PayPal division helped the online retailer overcome increasing competition from Amazon.com Inc and a well-publicized cyber attack.Investors had been braced for a tough quarter.Ebay's stock has fallen more than 8 percent since April, hurt by the cyber attack disclosed in May that compromised data for some 145 million customers, the departure of highly regarded PayPal chief David Marcus, and intensifying competition from both online and offline rivals.EBay was also hurt by a change in Google Inc's  algorithm, which pushed eBay results lower in search rankings, slowing traffic.That slowdown was seen in June in a measure of transactions across eBay's core Marketplaces platform, known as gross merchandise value, with the growth rate falling to 7 percent from around a double-digit pace in previous months. ""We had a challenging first half of the year with several distractions,"" Bob Swan, the chief financial officer, told analysts on a conference call, noting that the cyber attack and the Google search engine changes ""had an immediate and dramatic impact.""Executives said eBay will spend more on measures to entice users back, including coupons, seller incentives and increased marketing.Several investment brokerages had downgraded their forecasts ahead of Wednesday's results. The second-quarter results and eBay's revenue outlook were roughly in line with those tempered expectations. Revenue rose to $4.37 billion for the quarter, compared with $3.88 billion a year ago; Wall Street had forecast revenue of $4.38 billion, on average.Payment volume leaped a better-than-expected 29 percent. Gross merchandise value grew 12 percent, in line with or slightly better than analysts' forecasts.Going forward, eBay will have to grapple with stiffening competition across its businesses. Marcus departed for Facebook's messaging team in June. The payments service faces a growing challenge from the likes of Amazon, which launched a recurring payments program in June. Google is also expected to delve further into this field.Brick-and-mortar retailers are investing to boost their online presence. EBay also has to fend off a growing coterie of fast-growing retail upstarts that focus on specific categories such as home and apparel.Longer term, industry analysts speculate that Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holdings Ltd IPO-BABA.N, which is going public this year in what could be the largest-ever tech IPO, is preparing to leverage its U.S. investments into a play for the U.S. retail arena, the world's largest.On Wednesday, eBay forecast third-quarter revenue of $4.3 billion to $4.4 billion, compared with expectations for $4.4 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.For the second quarter, it posted non-GAAP earnings per share of 69 cents, a penny better than forecasts for 68 cents.Shares in eBay rose slightly to $50.94 after hours, from a close at $50.70 on the Nasdaq.

265,"  (Recasts, adding quote from Bewkes)By Soyoung Kim and Liana B. BakerNEW YORK, July 16 Rupert Murdoch's Twenty-First Century Fox Inc made an audacious offer for Time Warner Inc that if it succeeds would transform the American media landscape and cement the 83-year-old's status as the most powerful magnate in U.S. media and entertainment.While Time Warner, whose assets include the HBO cable channel and the Warner Bros movie studio, rejected the $80 billion bid, Murdoch is unlikely to abandon the pursuit and has the ""disciplined determination"" to get the deal done, people close to the situation said. Investors expect he will eventually raise the offer and increase the cash component - 40 percent - to win the prize.Murdoch's proposal, fresh on the heels of his high-profile divorce and a damaging phone-hacking scandal that involved his British tabloids, is aggressively bold even for a media mogul whose ambitions are legendary.A combined Fox-Time Warner would have a massive array of media and sports content and be in a very powerful negotiating position with cable and satellite distributors - some of whom have themselves announced mega-deals and newer ways of getting to consumers, such as online video distributors Netflix Inc  and Amazon.com Inc.""It's a chance to put some great programming and content assets under one umbrella,"" a person close to the situation said. ""There are other alternatives, but none of them fit anywhere near as well as this does.""Still, Time Warner pushed back strongly against Murdoch's approach, insisting the offer undervalued the media conglomerate and raising fears about the dominating role that his family would play, another person close to the situation said on Wednesday.In particular, the board is worried about the future value of Fox's shares, which represented 60 percent of its cash-and-stock proposal. Those fears were magnified by a lack of voting rights, the source said, as that would concentrate too much power in the hands of Murdoch and his sons.""To do a merger of this scale and size where Time Warner shareholders have no insight into the destiny of the company is very troubling,"" the source, who was not authorized to speak on the record, told Reuters.Time Warner Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Bewkes told the conglomerate's employees in a videotaped appearance that the company's standalone strategic plan would create value ""superior to any proposal"" that Fox could offer.The acquisition, if ever completed, would mark the second-largest media deal ever, when debt is included, trailing only Time Warner's disastrous takeover of AOL in 2000.In the end, a Time Warner deal is likely to hinge on price. The source pointed out that Fox's stock has traded at the highest multiple of its peer group and Time Warner - prior to its 17 percent rally on Wednesday - was trading at the lowest. Time Warner worries that the stock - the main ""currency"" of the deal - may be ripe for a pullback, lowering the value that is currently on the table.According to StarMine SmartEstimates, Fox shares trade at a multiple of about 19.5 times 12-month forward earnings, above the group median of 17.8 and now in line with Time Warner's 19.5 times - a valuation substantially above where the shares closed on Tuesday. Shares of Fox dropped 6.2 percent to $33.The offer, first reported by The New York Times, was worth  about $80 billion, or $85 a share, when it was made in June.Fox estimates that a combined company, which would have $60 billion in annual revenue, would save $1 billion in costs and possibly more, the people familiar with the matter said.Detailed negotiations with Time Warner could reveal even more potential savings, they said, which may then justify sweetening the offer. Fox said no talks were under way, and it has no desire to go hostile or to bid against itself with a higher offer, the people familiar with the matter said.Either way, a takeover by Fox could win the blessing of many of Time Warner's shareholders, a majority of whom also own Fox's non-voting stock. In addition, Time Warner does not have a staggered board and its bylaws allow as few as 15 percent of shareholders to call a special meeting, factors that could help a takeover bid.A number of Time Warner shareholders said Twenty-First Century Fox and Murdoch might have to raise the bid to as high as $95 per share from $85 when the bid was made in June to wrap up a merger. Murdoch also would do well to offer more cash upfront, investors said.Time Warner has no controlling shareholder, meaning the company could easily go into play, said Ken Griffin, founder and chief executive of Citadel LLC, which owns shares in both companies. ""It's going to be tough to say no,"" he said during a conference in New York.Mario Gabelli, chairman and CEO of Gamco Investors, said he expects a technology company with more cash than Fox, such as Apple or Amazon, could emerge with a bid.""It's not a dynamic I want to dismiss out of hand. They have a currency, and they understand the value of content,"" he said of the tech companies."" Gamco's funds own about 3.6 million shares of Time Warner and about 10.5 million Fox shares. SEEKING DANCE PARTNERS Fox's overtures are likely to reverberate across the industry, accelerating a wave of consolidation that is already well underway.Comcast Corp, the largest U.S. cable provider, offered in February to buy Time Warner Cable Inc for $45.2 billion in stock. Overseas, Fox's 39 percent-owned British Sky Broadcasting Group Plc is negotiating to buy Fox's Sky Italia and its Sky Deutschland subsidiary in a deal that could net Fox as much as $13 billion.As a consequence of the Murdoch bid, ""the urgency to find a dance partner will increase across the sector,"" said Bernstein Research analyst Todd Juenger.U.S. media shares closed higher on the deal, with top gainers including Discovery Communications Inc, up 6.3 percent; Viacom Inc, which rose 3.3 percent; and AMC Networks Inc, ending 4.5 percent higher.Murdoch started thinking about a potential merger with Time Warner as he was separating Twenty-First Century Fox, which mostly consists of media properties, from News Corp, focused on the Wall Street Journal and other publishing assets, people familiar with the company said.The separation, triggered by the British phone-hacking scandal which dragged Murdoch before the British parliament, has in the end positioned Fox to become a powerful consolidator of media properties, people familiar with the matter said.Fox has indicated it would sell Time Warner's CNN cable channel, a direct competitor of Fox News, to clear any regulatory hurdles, according to the people.At least one antitrust expert, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said it was unlikely that any issues that arise would kill a Fox deal for Time Warner. The source pointed out that there were five major content companies in the United States, plus numerous smaller ones.News of the Time Warner bid comes as Fox is reorganizing its television business, aiming to lift its network out of last place among the big U.S. broadcasters.Fox is being advised by Goldman Sachs and Centerview Partners, while Time Warner is working with Citigroup, people familiar with the matter said. JPMorgan Chase & Co  and Goldman Sachs would lead any financing required for the bid.Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom is providing legal advice to Fox, while Cravath, Swaine & Moore is legal adviser to Time Warner.

The launch of Kindle Unlimited comes as Amazon remains mired in a months-long contract dispute with the No. 4 U.S. publisher Hachette Book Group, owned by France's Lagardere, over how to price e-books. Amazon is also in talks about digital book pricing with Simon & Schuster, owned by CBS Corp.Amazon's move to offer the Kindle Unlimited service reflects consumers' growing preference toward subscription-based models for consuming digital media, such as Netflix Inc for movies and television shows and Spotify for music.The new Amazon service will compete with others in the market, including Oyster, which charges $9.95 per month for unlimited access to more than 500,000 titles. In an interview, Oyster's co-founder Eric Stromberg said he was not surprised by Amazon's move but that his company's partnership with major publishers gave Oyster a higher-quality catalog.""They've tried to pivot from transaction to subscription-based in other forms of media - music, movies, kids' books - and had limited success,"" Stromberg said of Amazon. ""Through our partnerships with Harper Collins and Simon & Schuster, two of the largest publishers in the world, we’re able to deliver to our audience a vast and deep catalog of the best books in the world,"" he said.

271,"   By Lewis Krauskopf  The success of General Electric Co's impending initial public offering for its private-label credit card unit could ride on investors' willingness to bet that a lukewarm consumer-led U.S. economic recovery heats up.GE began its investor road show on Friday for the IPO of the unit, to be called Synchrony Financial, as it revealed new details about the business.Set for the end of the month, the IPO of 15 percent of Synchrony is expected to raise around $3.1 billion, surpassing Ally Financial Inc as the biggest U.S. financial services stock flotation this year.While the IPO could enjoy a positive initial reception given the strong demand for offerings this year and investors' eagerness to deploy cash in the market, its longer-term performance will likely be hitched to the strength of the belief in a consumer recovery.""It’s a good indicator and good investment based on people who believe the economy is going to continue to improve as it relates to the consumer,"" said David Menlow, president of IPOfinancial.com, an IPO and secondary offering research firm.More than two-thirds of Synchrony's $9.4 billion in revenue last year came from its retail card business, which offers private label credit cards carrying brands of corporate partners such as Amazon.com Inc, JC Penney Co, Lowe's Companies Inc and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Some of those retailers including JC Penney and Wal-Mart have struggled to find sales growth this year even as the broader economy has recovered, in part because a broad swath of consumers remains constrained by debt and worried about job prospects.Still, they could eventually benefit from a strengthening recovery. A gauge of U.S. consumer spending rose solidly in June, the U.S. Commerce Department reported earlier this week, indicating the economy ended the second quarter on stronger footing.Synchrony's rivals in the private label card business include consumer banks such as Citigroup Inc and Wells Fargo. Synchrony's other revenue comes from financing for bigger ticket consumer purchases, such as electronics or jewelry, and for healthcare procedures.

274,"  BEIJING, July 21 The number of China's internet users going online with a mobile device - such as a smartphone or tablet - has overtaken those doing so with a personal computer (PC) for the first time, said the official China Internet Network Information Center (CNNIC) on Monday.China's total number of internet users crept up 2.3 percent to 632 million by the end of June, from 618 million at the end of 2013, said CNNIC's internet development statistics report.Of those, 527 million - or 83 percent - went online via mobile. Those doing so with a PC made up 81 percent the total.China is the largest smartphone market in the world, and by 2018 is likely to account for nearly one-third of the expected 1.8 billion smartphones shipped that year, according to data firm IDC.The increase in internet users was mainly driven by mobile, which grew 5.4 percent from the 500 million users at the end of 2013. The number of mobile shoppers surged 42 percent from December through June. Chinese e-commerce is dominated by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd , which is preparing for a mammoth initial public offering widely expected to take place in September.Alibaba's biggest competitor is JD.com Inc, which specialises in business-to-customer e-commerce in a similar vein to Amazon.com Inc, and is 17.6 percent owned by Alibaba arch-rival Tencent Holdings Ltd. Other online mobile services with rapid growth from the end of 2013 include music, video, gaming, search, and group-buying, all of which experienced double-digit increases.The fastest growing services were mobile payment, where users shot up 63.4 percent, online banking, with a 56.4 percent rise, and mobile travel booking, which was up 65.4 percent. But not all internet activity saw growth.

275,"   By Olivia Oran and Soyoung Kim | NEW YORK  NEW YORK PetSmart Inc has hired investment bank JPMorgan Chase & Co to evaluate a range of alternatives, including a leveraged share buyback and a potential deal with private equity, according to people familiar with the matter.PetSmart's hiring of JPMorgan in recent weeks comes as investor pressure mounts on the pet supply store chain to sell itself, at a time when fierce competition from large retailers including Wal-Mart and Amazon squeezes specialty stores.Activist investment firm Jana Partners LLC, as well as Longview Asset Management, which together own a stake of close to 20 percent in PetSmart, have urged the nearly $7 billion company to pursue a sale.Buyout firms have long been interested in the prospect of taking PetSmart private and the latest pressure from large shareholders have prompted several to explore a leveraged buyout, people familiar with the matter said, asking not to be named because the matter is not private. PetSmart's evaluation of strategic alternatives is in the very early stages, and the company is currently more inclined to pursue a leveraged buyback - taking on debt to conduct a big share repurchase program, than other deal options, the people said.PetSmart is expected by analysts to generate $930 million of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization this year, and its nearly debt-free balance sheet also can withstand some borrowing.Representatives for PetSmart and JPMorgan declined to comment. Jana, run by Barry Rosenstein, often pressures companies it invests in to change strategies or sell themselves. It disclosed a stake in grocery chain Safeway Inc in September and asked it to explore strategic alternatives.Safeway eventually agreed to be acquired by private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management in a deal valued at about $9.4 billion in March. In response to shareholder pressure, PetSmart said on July 7 that it is reviewing potential changes in its capital structure, with a focus on returning capital to shareholders.The Phoenix, Arizona-based retailer, founded in 1986, has about 53,000 employees, operates more than 1,340 pet stores, as well as 200 in-store dog and cat boarding facilities, according to its website.

U.S. claims for initial jobless benefits fell to a seasonally adjusted 284,000, the lowest since mid-February 2006. New home sales declined 8.1 percent in June, the biggest drop in almost a year. The PHLX housing sector index lost 2.7 percent, marking its biggest one-day drop since February.Recent gains on Wall Street have been fueled by earnings, which have been strong this quarter. With 41 percent of S&P 500 companies having reported results so far, 68 percent have posted earnings that topped expectations, according to Thomson Reuters data, above the long-term average of 63 percent. On the revenue side, 62.1 percent have beaten analysts' forecasts, compared with the historical average of 61 percent. Facebook Inc jumped 5.2 percent to $74.98 and hit an intraday record high of $76.74 a day after the world's No. 1 social network reported earnings and revenue that beat expectations.Caterpillar Inc raised its full-year outlook but posted a decline in sales, pushing its stock down 3.1 percent to $105.04. The Dow component is the world's largest maker of earth-moving equipment.""There's a tug of war in the market today between the companies that did well and the companies that didn't. Caterpillar was disappointing, but stocks remain reasonably valued and the earnings season supports continued gains,"" said Kate Warne, investment strategist at Edward Jones in St. Louis.The Dow Jones industrial average dipped 2.83 points or 0.02 percent, to close at 17,083.80. The S&P 500  gained 0.97 of a point or 0.05 percent to end at 1,987.98, its second record closing high in a row. The Nasdaq Composite  shed 1.59 points or 0.04 percent, to finish at 4,472.11.

Starbucks Corp posted revenue that was slightly higher than expected. The coffee chain's stock slipped 0.7 percent to $79.91 in after-hours trading. Baidu Inc rose 6.4 percent to $217.35 in extended-hours trading after China's biggest Internet search company reported results that were much stronger than had been expected.During the regular session, stocks that made big moves after earnings included Under Armour Inc - up 14.7 percent at $69.55 after the sports apparel manufacturer and retailer reported a sharp rise in revenue. Under Armour's stock hit an all-time intraday high of $70.25 and was the S&P 500's biggest gainer.The benchmark S&P 500's biggest decliner was homebuilder D.R. Horton Inc, which tumbled 11.5 percent to $21.94 after the company reported a 23 percent slide in profits. The results gave investors a reason to unload some homebuilders' shares.General Motors Co dropped 4.5 percent to $35.74 after the company reported a much lower second-quarter profit because of numerous recalls and the expected cost of at least $400 million for its victims' compensation fund.Almost 51 percent of stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange ended the day lower, while 52 percent of Nasdaq-listed shares ended in negative territory.About 5.58 billion shares traded on all U.S. platforms, according to BATS exchange data, compared with the month-to-date average of 5.54 billion.(Editing by Jan Paschal)",2014-07-24,AMZN,"Thu Jul 24, 2014 | 5:56pm EDT",US STOCKS-Wall St ends flat on mixed earnings; S&P 500 at record,http://www.reuters.com//article/markets-usa-stocks-idUSL2N0PZ36W20140724?type=companyNews

286,"   By Deepa Seetharaman | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Amazon.com Inc's message to investors has always been clear: trust in founder and CEO Jeff Bezos. But after more than a year of mostly disappointing quarterly results, that faith is being tested.Some on Wall Street wonder if Amazon may have bitten off more than it can chew. After an unusually busy first half of the year that saw the online retailer spend on developing everything from mobile phones and Hollywood-style production to grocery deliveries, investors are ready to see it curtail its ambitions and start delivering sustainable profits.Or at least offer evidence that Bezos' ever-increasing investments are going to soon generate appealing returns for its main online retailing business.""It does get frustrating when they continue to spend quarter after quarter and they don't let the revenue flow through,"" said Michael Scanlon, who manages $3.5 billion at Manulife Asset Management and holds shares of Amazon. ""I'm definitely ready for profits.""Others argue that easing off on the throttle now may thwart its goal of becoming the Wal-Mart of online retail. That is particularly the case as China's Alibaba - which handles more ecommerce than Amazon and eBay Inc combined - slowly develops a U.S. consumer presence and prepares for an initial public offering in the U.S.BIG SELLING POINT Bezos insists on taking the long view. In his letter to shareholders last year, he responded to criticism about spending by saying investing in a ""just-in-time fashion would be too clever by half.""Its increasing share of the retail dollar is still a big selling point for investors.   ""You have to take a long-term perspective and you have to buy in that you're going to see solid topline growth,"" said Needham & Co analyst Kerry Rice. But that market share grab comes at a price a price that was highlighted in its second-quarter results issued on Thursday. Amazon reported its largest quarterly loss since 2012 as operating expenses rose 24 percent, led by a 40 percent surge in spending on technology and content.Its shares fell 9.6 percent on Friday, wiping out about $16 billion of value. The company has now fallen short of Wall Street's earnings expectations in seven of the past nine quarters.Perhaps worse, it predicted an operating loss of up to $810 million for the current third quarter, the biggest quarter-on-quarter reversal in profitability since 2003, B. Riley analysts estimated. Included is $410 million in stock-based compensation in the third quarter, but excluded are ""acquisitions, investments, restructurings.""Investors say they are concerned about not only Amazon spending every dollar that comes in the door but also the lack of disclosure about where it is being spent.""Most companies with the kind of gross revenue Amazon has are not posting these kind of losses,"" said Michael Yoshikami, CEO of Destination Wealth Management, which sold its stake in Amazon last year. ""You've got to give more information to justify faith in the name.""  But Amazon has always kept its data close, even basic details such as how many Kindle tablets it has sold or the precise number of subscribers to its Amazon Prime free shipping and media service, citing competitive reasons.Scanlon said that greater disclosure ""would help you do things like measure return on investments. You can start to get your arms around more what the duration of the spending will be.""TOUGH TO SWALLOW Two areas that have proven hard for some to swallow are a panoply of new devices based on a heavily modified and less-established version of Google's Android, and Amazon's move into program production. This week, Amazon launched the $649 Fire Phone, but it failed to impress reviewers. The phone joins a Fire streaming box and a line of tablets and e-readers - most sold at prices close to their cost to produce and get to market - in its drive to galvanize sales of digital books and media.Amazon's foray into TV - from ""Alpha House"" starring John Goodman to just-announced kids show ""Annedroids"" - has never garnered Netflix-like acclaim. Yet it intends to devote more than $100 million to original video content this quarter.""There's a lot of stuff they're doing that's questionable,""  said S&P Capital IQ analyst Tuna Amobi, who has a ""sell"" rating on Amazon, referring in particular to Amazon's content and hardware endeavors.Investors might be soothed if Amazon did a share buyback, Scanlon said, adding it was unlikely. While Amazon has more than $5 billion of cash and cash equivalents as of June, analysts say there's little percentage in Amazon buying its own shares, given their lofty valuation even after a slump this year.Some assessments tag Amazon's shares with a highly-overvalued warning sign.According to Thomson Reuters StarMine, Amazon’s shares carry an intrinsic worth of $36.37 – or about a tenth of its current price – making the stock one of the most overvalued names in its universe of more than 4,000 U.S. companies. StarMine calculates its intrinsic value figure using growth expectations for the coming decade, and it suggests that at its current price, investors are discounting a much faster growth rate than Amazon could hope to achieve in coming years.  B. Riley, which downgraded Amazon to neutral from buy on Friday, argued it was hard to justify its valuation given ""compromised cash flows.""""There's nothing wrong with spending to diversify your business, but it has to be a focused manner as opposed to throwing spaghetti on the wall and seeing what sticks,"" Amobi said. ""They're a public company, they need some sensitivity"" to shareholders.

287,"   By Caroline Valetkevitch | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Some disappointing U.S. earnings, including Amazon.com, and weak German economic data pressured world stock markets on Friday, while the euro hit an eight-month low against the U.S. dollar.Amazon was the biggest drag on the S&P 500. Its shares sank 9.6 percent to $324.01 a day after the online retailer reported an unexpectedly big loss for the second quarter. Visa's results also disappointed and its shares ended down 3.6 percent at $214.77.""The earnings season overall has been in line but when companies with rich valuations disappoint, you're going to get crucified,"" said Lawrence Glazer, managing partner at Mayflower Advisors in Boston. Signs emerged that tensions between the West and Russia are starting to hurt confidence in Germany, Europe's largest economy and the driver of its recovery. Germany's Ifo survey showed a hefty fall in business confidence over the last few weeks, prompting concerns Germany could be stuttering.MSCI's All-World Index was down 0.4 percent, and European stocks ended 0.7 percent lower.The Dow Jones industrial average fell 123.23 points or 0.72 percent, to 16,960.57. The S&P 500 lost 9.64 points or 0.48 percent, to 1,978.34, after closing at record highs for two straight days. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 22.54 points or 0.5 percent, to 4,449.56.Goldman Sachs (GS.N) downgraded its global allocation to equities to neutral on a short-term basis although the brokerage remained overweight stocks for the longer term.Equity markets worldwide have rallied steadily through the year, with the MSCI All-World Index hitting a record high in early July. By region, Goldman is overweight in Europe and Japan and underweight in the United States. The euro was last down 0.27 percent against the dollar at $1.3429 after falling to an eight-month low of $1.3421 on the weak German business data.""U.S. data has been good or better than expected, whereas European data continues to point to a slowdown,"" said Boris Schlossberg, managing director in FX strategy at BK Asset Management in New York. European officials are to continue talks over plans to squeeze Russia with further sanctions following the downing of a Malaysia Airlines plane that killed almost 300 people.

Amazon was the biggest drag on the S&P 500. Its shares sank 9.6 percent to $324.01 a day after the online retailer reported an unexpectedly big loss for the second quarter. Visa's  results also disappointed and its shares ended down 3.6 percent at $214.77.     ""The earnings season overall has been in line but when companies with rich valuations disappoint, you're going to get crucified,"" said Lawrence Glazer, managing partner at Mayflower Advisors in Boston.      Signs emerged that tensions between the West and Russia are starting to hurt confidence in Germany, Europe's largest economy and the driver of its recovery. Germany's Ifo survey showed a hefty fall in business confidence over the last few weeks, prompting concerns Germany could be stuttering.      MSCI's All-World Index was down 0.4 percent, and European stocks ended 0.7 percent lower.     The Dow Jones industrial average fell 123.23 points or 0.72 percent, to 16,960.57. The S&P 500 lost 9.64 points or 0.48 percent, to 1,978.34, after closing at record highs for two straight days.     The Nasdaq Composite dropped 22.54 points or 0.5 percent, to 4,449.56.     Goldman Sachs downgraded its global allocation to equities to neutral on a short-term basis although the brokerage remained overweight stocks for the longer term.      Equity markets worldwide have rallied steadily through the year, with the MSCI All-World Index hitting a record high in early July. By region, Goldman is overweight in Europe and Japan and underweight in the United States.     The euro was last down 0.27 percent against the dollar at $1.3429 after falling to an eight-month low of $1.3421 on the weak German business data.     ""U.S. data has been good or better than expected, whereas European data continues to point to a slowdown,"" said Boris Schlossberg, managing director in FX strategy at BK Asset Management in New York.      European officials are to continue talks over plans to squeeze Russia with further sanctions following the downing of a Malaysia Airlines plane that killed almost 300 people.       Dollar-traded Russian stocks fell 1.6 percent. Russian bonds also fell as the country's central bank unexpectedly raised interest rates.      U.S. Treasuries prices jumped, with 10-year Treasuries  up 11/32 to yield 2.469 percent.      Gold edged up as speculators bought back bearish bets ahead of the weekend.

Earnings have largely been better than expected this season in terms of both profit and revenue. However, there have been high-profile disappointments, including Boeing Co and Caterpillar Inc earlier this week.Amazon.com Inc tumbled 9.6 percent to $324.01 as the biggest drag on the S&P 500 after reporting an unexpectedly big second-quarter loss due to greater expenses on investments.

Visa Inc was the Dow's largest decliner, down 3.6 percent to $214.77 after the world's largest credit and debit card company cut its revenue forecast for the year. As the costliest stock in the price-weighted index, Visa accounted for about half the Dow's drop.""The earnings season overall has been in line (with analysts' estimates), but when companies with rich valuations disappoint, you're going to get crucified,"" said Lawrence Glazer, managing partner at Mayflower Advisors in Boston.

296,"   By Deepa Seetharaman | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Amazon.com Inc's message to investors has always been clear: trust in founder and CEO Jeff Bezos. But after more than a year of mostly disappointing quarterly results, that faith is being tested.Some on Wall Street wonder if Amazon may have bitten off more than it can chew. After an unusually busy first half of the year that saw the online retailer spend on developing everything from mobile phones and Hollywood-style production to grocery deliveries, investors are ready to see it curtail its ambitions and start delivering sustainable profits.Or at least offer evidence that Bezos' ever-increasing investments are going to soon generate appealing returns for its main online retailing business.""It does get frustrating when they continue to spend quarter after quarter and they don't let the revenue flow through,"" said Michael Scanlon, who manages $3.5 billion at Manulife Asset Management and holds shares of Amazon. ""I'm definitely ready for profits.""Others argue that easing off on the throttle now may thwart its goal of becoming the Wal-Mart of online retail. That is particularly the case as China's Alibaba - which handles more ecommerce than Amazon and eBay Inc combined - slowly develops a U.S. consumer presence and prepares for an initial public offering in the U.S.BIG SELLING POINT Bezos insists on taking the long view. In his letter to shareholders last year, he responded to criticism about spending by saying investing in a ""just-in-time fashion would be too clever by half.""Its increasing share of the retail dollar is still a big selling point for investors.   ""You have to take a long-term perspective and you have to buy in that you're going to see solid topline growth,"" said Needham & Co analyst Kerry Rice. But that market share grab comes at a price a price that was highlighted in its second-quarter results issued on Thursday. Amazon reported its largest quarterly loss since 2012 as operating expenses rose 24 percent, led by a 40 percent surge in spending on technology and content.Its shares fell 9.6 percent on Friday, wiping out about $16 billion of value. The company has now fallen short of Wall Street's earnings expectations in seven of the past nine quarters.Perhaps worse, it predicted an operating loss of up to $810 million for the current third quarter, the biggest quarter-on-quarter reversal in profitability since 2003, B. Riley analysts estimated. Included is $410 million in stock-based compensation in the third quarter, but excluded are ""acquisitions, investments, restructurings.""Investors say they are concerned about not only Amazon spending every dollar that comes in the door but also the lack of disclosure about where it is being spent.""Most companies with the kind of gross revenue Amazon has are not posting these kind of losses,"" said Michael Yoshikami, CEO of Destination Wealth Management, which sold its stake in Amazon last year. ""You've got to give more information to justify faith in the name.""  But Amazon has always kept its data close, even basic details such as how many Kindle tablets it has sold or the precise number of subscribers to its Amazon Prime free shipping and media service, citing competitive reasons.Scanlon said that greater disclosure ""would help you do things like measure return on investments. You can start to get your arms around more what the duration of the spending will be.""TOUGH TO SWALLOW Two areas that have proven hard for some to swallow are a panoply of new devices based on a heavily modified and less-established version of Google's Android, and Amazon's move into program production. This week, Amazon launched the $649 Fire Phone, but it failed to impress reviewers. The phone joins a Fire streaming box and a line of tablets and e-readers - most sold at prices close to their cost to produce and get to market - in its drive to galvanize sales of digital books and media.Amazon's foray into TV - from ""Alpha House"" starring John Goodman to just-announced kids show ""Annedroids"" - has never garnered Netflix-like acclaim. Yet it intends to devote more than $100 million to original video content this quarter.""There's a lot of stuff they're doing that's questionable,""  said S&P Capital IQ analyst Tuna Amobi, who has a ""sell"" rating on Amazon, referring in particular to Amazon's content and hardware endeavors.Investors might be soothed if Amazon did a share buyback, Scanlon said, adding it was unlikely. While Amazon has more than $5 billion of cash and cash equivalents as of June, analysts say there's little percentage in Amazon buying its own shares, given their lofty valuation even after a slump this year.Some assessments tag Amazon's shares with a highly-overvalued warning sign.According to Thomson Reuters StarMine, Amazon’s shares carry an intrinsic worth of $36.37 – or about a tenth of its current price – making the stock one of the most overvalued names in its universe of more than 4,000 U.S. companies. StarMine calculates its intrinsic value figure using growth expectations for the coming decade, and it suggests that at its current price, investors are discounting a much faster growth rate than Amazon could hope to achieve in coming years.  B. Riley, which downgraded Amazon to neutral from buy on Friday, argued it was hard to justify its valuation given ""compromised cash flows.""""There's nothing wrong with spending to diversify your business, but it has to be a focused manner as opposed to throwing spaghetti on the wall and seeing what sticks,"" Amobi said. ""They're a public company, they need some sensitivity"" to shareholders.

Before it is printed by one of Amazon's sellers, users can customize a product like as a bobble head figure by changing its skin and eye color, hair style and outfit, Amazon said. ""The customization is something we're keenly interested in,"" said Petra Schindler-Carter, director for Amazon marketplace sales, speaking in an interview. ""We'll always look for new applications for that.""Amazon, which has more than 240 million users, has expanded  its marketplaces division to include new areas such as fine art and wine. It is part of Amazon's larger investment into new areas like mobile services and original content that led to its larger-than-expected second-quarter loss last week. The new printing option taps into a broader ""Maker movement"" among tech entrepreneurs in northern California, and to some extent Europe, that is focused on customizing 3D objects rather than development software or mobile applications. 3D printers have gained in popularity on Amazon Supply, a wholesale site for businesses.

(amzn.to/1rD27WM)Based on a review of many titles, Amazon argued that ebook priced at $9.99 sold 1.74 times as many copies as one sold at $14.99, generating 16 percent more revenue.It said keeping prices low saved money for consumers while authors would get higher royalties and 74 percent more readers, with publishers also getting more money. ""The total pie is bigger and there is more to share amongst the parties,"" it said.Amazon claims that pricing an e-book at $14.99 or $19.99 is too expensive and unjustifiable in most cases. ""With an ebook, there's no printing, no over-printing, no need to forecast, no returns, no lost sales due to out-of-stock, no warehousing costs, no transportation costs, and there is no secondary market — ebooks cannot be resold as used books,"" Amazon said in the blog.

Nine of the 10 primary S&P 500 sectors fell on the day.United Parcel Service shares fell 3.7 percent to $98.86 after the world's biggest courier company slashed its earnings forecast for the year due to spending to boost capacity. It also reported second-quarter earnings that were below expectations. Rival shipping company FedEx Corp was down 1.6 percent at $147.14. The Dow Jones Transportation index, which is often viewed as a proxy for business activity, fell 1.4 percent. It is about 3 percent away from the record closing high hit last week.UPS is the latest bellwether name whose results have disappointed investors, following Amazon.com Inc and Boeing Co last week. Nonetheless, this earnings season has largely been a positive for equities.With more than half the S&P 500 having reported already, almost 70 percent have topped earnings expectations, according to Thomson Reuters data, well above the long-term average of 63 percent. More than 63 percent have topped revenue forecasts, above the long-term average of 61 percent.""If we started to see more negative outlooks, that would be a reason to pause, but so far this earnings season speaks to the health of corporate America and suggests markets still have room to run,"" said David Lebovitz, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Funds in New York. Telecom stocks were the only sector of the market to rise on Tuesday, adding 2.2 percent after Windstream Holdings  filed to spin off assets into a tax-efficient publicly traded real estate investment trust. The stock jumped 12.3 percent to $11.83 in its busiest trading day on record. Frontier Communications added 14.3 percent to $6.79.After the market closed, Twitter Inc jumped 14.5 percent to $44.20 in extended trading after the social networking company reported second-quarter results, which included revenue that more than doubled. The shares had closed up 1.7 percent in regular NYSE trade ahead of the results.Dow component American Express Co also reported after the market closed; its shares were little changed after the bell.The Dow Jones industrial average fell 70.16 points, or 0.41 percent, to 16,912.43, the S&P 500 lost 8.93 points, or 0.45 percent, to 1,969.98, and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 2.21 points, or 0.05 percent, to 4,442.70. The Nasdaq's decline was tempered by biotechnology shares, with the Nasdaq Biotech index up 1.1 percent.Dow components Pfizer and Merck, the No. 1 and No. 2 U.S. drug companies, respectively, reported better-than-expected results. Merck's new drugs offset declining sales of those facing generic competition. Pfizer was helped by growing sales of its cancer medicines. Merck rose 1.1 percent at $58.58 while Pfizer shed 1.2 percent to $29.73.Corning Inc dropped 9.3 percent to $20 after reporting earnings that came in below estimates as demand fell for its Gorilla Glass, which is used in iPhones and Galaxy devices.Economic data had little impact on the direction of equities.U.S. consumer confidence jumped in July to a high not seen since October 2007, but single-family home prices fell 0.3 percent in May on a seasonally adjusted basis, falling short of expectations.President Barack Obama said the United States was imposing new sanctions on Russia in the energy, arms and finance sectors, following similar moves by the European Union in reaction to Moscow's support for rebels in eastern Ukraine.About 57 percent of stocks traded on the New York Stock Exchange closed lower on the day while about 47 percent of Nasdaq-listed shares ended in negative territory. About 5.59 billion shares traded on all U.S. platforms, according to BATS exchange data, compared with the month-to-date average of 5.54 billion.

307,"  MUMBAI, July 29 Flipkart, India's largest e-tailer, said on Tuesday it raised a fresh round of funding worth $1 billion as it tries to aggressively scale up after Amazon.com Inc's rapid expansion in the country has heated up competition.Flipkart, founded in 2007 by two former Amazon employees, has raised $760 million since its launch and the recent funding round is the largest for an Indian e-tailer.The company said Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC participated in the fundraising along with existing investors Tiger Global Management LLC and the South African media company Naspers Ltd.The company, which is popular for selling books and electronics online, operates as a marketplace that allows third-party vendors to sell products on the site. Earlier this year Flipkart acquired fashion portal Myntra and crossed $1 billion in gross merchandise value. Amazon, which entered India last June, has taken on rivals by slashing prices, launching next-day delivery, adding new product categories and embarking on a high-voltage advertisement campaign.The companies vying for a bigger slice of the Indian online retail market include Flipkart, New Delhi-based marketplace Snapdeal, fashion e-tailer Jabong, and global giants Amazon and eBay Inc. The Indian e-commerce market was worth $13 billion in 2013, with online travel accounting for over 70 percent of consumer e-commerce transactions. Online sales of retail goods totaled $1.6 billion in 2013, according to research firm Forrester, and are expected to reach $76 billion by 2021, Technopak said.By comparison, China's business and consumer e-commerce sales may surpass $180 billion this year, with industry leader Alibaba readying an initial public offering (IPO) in the United States.

308,"   By Roberta Rampton | WASHINGTON, July 29  WASHINGTON, July 29 Putting off expensive measures to curb climate change will only cost the United States more in the long run, the White House said on Tuesday in a report meant to bolster a series of actions  President Barack Obama has proposed to address global warming.""Each decade we delay acting results in an added cost of dealing with the problem of an extra 40 percent,"" said Jason Furman, chairman of Obama's Council of Economic Advisers.""We know way more than enough to justify acting today,"" Furman told reporters.The report drew its conclusions from 16 economic studies that modeled the costs of climate change. It was released as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency holds public hearings on its plan to cut carbon emissions from power plants - the centerpiece of Obama's climate action plan. Business groups have said the EPA's plan would hurt jobs in the coal sector and harm the U.S. economy.The White House and environmental groups have pushed back against that argument. Last month, a bipartisan report commissioned by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, former Secretary of the Treasury Henry Paulson and environmentalist Tom Steyer forecast  a multibillion-dollar price tag for climate costs such as property losses from storms, declining crop yields and soaring power bills during heat waves.The Obama administration plans to made additional climate announcements on Tuesday. Energy Secretary Ernie Moniz is set to announce actions by his department to reduce methane emissions from the natural gas transmission and distribution system, along with partnerships and ""stakeholder commitments,"" the White House said.This fall, the administration is set to propose new rules to cut methane emissions from oil and gas wells on public lands, and also will decide whether to propose regulations to address emissions from operations on private land, said Dan Utech, special assistant to the president for energy and climate change.The administration also will announce partnerships with IBM , Amazon, Microsoft, Coca Cola  and others to use data to help make agriculture and food production more resilient to climate change, the White House said.

Of the initial volume, 80 percent will move on waterways, mostly from Porto Velho, Rondonia, in Brazil's interior. The rest will be trucked in until a railway is finished. The company said the new route will shave 34 percent off its freight costs from shipping out of Brazil's main port of Santos, thousands of kilometers south. ADM received approval for terminal use from waterway regulator Antaq last month in what it said was the first contract awarded under Brazil's new port law, which was passed in 2013 in an attempt to draw more private investment.Rivals Bunge and Cargill also plan to increase exports through northern Brazil, and dozens of companies are expected to follow as Brazil prepares to plant what could be yet another record soybean crop.

315,"   By Deepa Seetharaman | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Seattle audio and video technician Todd Mueller showed up last year for what might have been a routine job except for one thing: Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) was taking notes. As he mounted a flat-screen TV on the wall, an Amazon employee studied how he covered his shoes and used a blanket to protect the hardwood floor.After at least two years of study, Amazon is ramping up efforts to offer repair, installation and other services online, tackling a fragmented but potentially rich U.S. market that may be worth an estimated $400 billion.Amazon's experiment with services goes back to at least mid-2012 in its hometown of Seattle. It's now expanded the tests to New York and Los Angeles, six service providers who worked and talked with the company told Reuters.More locations and services are coming soon. As soon as mid-August, Amazon will take as much as a 20-percent cut from services booked through its website, though timing and figures may change, according to providers and several hard-to-find pages on Amazon's website devoted to local services. (here)Providing services would be a new frontier for Amazon, which hopes to enter one of the few remaining consumer sectors yet to succumb to Internet commerce. Its foray into the area comes as investors worry about Amazon's growing spending on initiatives with uncertain pay back. [ID:nL2N0Q0038]It's unclear how Amazon can create an online exchange for services where others like Angie's List (ANGI.O) have failed to gain traction for years. While services like Yelp (YELP.N) and Craigslist show what's available, getting a job done still often involves an old-fashioned telephone call.The biggest challenge would be attracting enough small businesses to the site, Wunderlich Securities' Blake Harper said. Angie's List's spending on marketing - almost half its total revenue - to attract customers and retain providers has kept it in the red, analysts said.""While the company has impressive logistical capabilities, it is lacking the local business information, reviews, and sales force, among other attributes, to begin to compete in the market,"" Harper said in a June 11 note, of Amazon. ""We have a healthy respect for Amazon's ruthless competitive nature, but expect the local market to be much more difficult for them to scale than the ecommerce business.""Amazon has a team of people that deal with local merchants. If its plan works, it may encourage loyalty by helping customers book well-regarded plumbers, auto mechanics and others, and develops a high-margin revenue stream.In trials, Amazon has recommended services alongside relevant purchases online and providers are backed by its ""A-to-Z"" money-back guarantee.""They're taking it from A-to-Z,"" said Alex Vyborg, owner of SpeakerGuy Inc, a 15-person home theater and installation company based in Rancho Palos Verdes, California, that has been working with Amazon for about four months. ""Instead of selling you a product and some guy installs it and it doesn't work, here you have a reputable seller and installer."" An Amazon spokesman declined to comment.LIKE A JOB INTERVIEW Eventually, Amazon plans to build an online marketplace for services from plumbing to babysitting. [ID:nL2N0OR1U4]For now, it's focused on assembly, installation and repair in Seattle, New York and Los Angeles, such as installing toilets or adding speakers to a car, according to its website. Building a local services marketplace has been Chief Executive Jeff Bezos' vision for over a decade, three people familiar with the matter said. The Amazon founder was an early admirer of the OpenTable model of dinner reservations, according to one of the sources.  Amazon's efforts are aided by the ubiquity of the smartphone, which allows service providers to field calls and book appointments on the go. Last year, Amazon invited Seattle-based providers to its downtown headquarters for demonstrations of how the pilot would work, including how appointments would be handled, said Mueller, owner of installation company More than Audio, and other providers.Amazon also asked exhaustive questions, such as what plumbing services it could legally offer or what happens when faulty wiring or another complication prevents completion.""They came in educated,"" said Stephen Brandeis, operations manager for the Electric Company of Seattle, who likened the experience to a job interview. ""They were doing problem-solving on very focused areas.""Amazon has stipulated that participating businesses carry liability insurance of at least $1 million and in some cases $2 million, according to cached versions of Amazon webpages advertising those services.They must reply to customer service requests within 24 hours, and be subject to annual background checks. RIGHT THEN, RIGHT THERE Service providers said Amazon has won them new clients, despite the lack of promotion. Raman Singh, owner of Seattle-based Drain Pro Plumbing Inc, said he got close to 100 jobs, mostly from new clients, through Amazon.But some worry they will have to raise prices once Amazon begins to take a cut. According to one internal website, Amazon intends to take a 20 percent cut of jobs under $1,000 by August 14 and 15 percent for services over $1,000. This compares to the 15 percent to 30 percent cut taken by Angie's List, RBC analysts estimate.The more than 20 jobs offered by Amazon found by Reuters all cost less than $400, far below the median $3,200 spent on a home repair projects between 2009 and 2011, according to U.S. government data.Amazon has also required providers include parts in the cost of the service, say mounting brackets and cables for a TV installation. Supplies, fuel and labor required in an Amazon job add about $100 in expenses to a job that costs less than $300, said Vyborg.In its pitch, Amazon emphasized its ability to help find new customers and cited data showing that its users spend more than $22 billion every month in offline purchases.""Customers will see your services when they buy related products online,"" according to a page intended for providers. ""They'll able to buy them right then, right there.""

319,"   By Soham Chatterjee and Lehar Maan  When Amazon.com Inc was developing its most advanced tablet to date, it asked a little-known company to solve a tricky problem with the screen: how to produce rich colors without draining battery life.With the help of Milpitas, California-based Nanosys Inc, the Kindle Fire HDX 7 became one of Amazon's best-selling tablets, winning critical acclaim for its vibrant display.The answer? Quantum dots, which are semiconductor crystals 10,000 times finer than a human hair. They convert electrical energy into light and can be manipulated to produce precise colors.""If you put a regular LCD display next to a quantum-dot LCD display, your grandmother can tell the difference,"" said Jason Carlson, chief executive officer of QD Vision Inc, which makes quantum dots for Sony Corp's Triluminos TV.So explosive is demand for this technology that the few companies able to make quantum dots are struggling to keep up. Most are partnering with big display makers to set up industrial-scale manufacturing.QD Vision and Nanosys are considering going public in the next year or so.But while quantum dots are cheaper and consume less power than organic light-emitting diodes (OLED), their rival technology at the sharp end of the display business, they cannot yet be produced in the same quantities.Quantum dots from most suppliers also contain cadmium, a toxic metal whose use is restricted in many countries.A recent survey by DisplayMate Technologies rated Amazon's Kindle Fire display as the clear winner in color reproduction against Apple Inc's iPad mini and Google Inc's Nexus 7. (bit.ly/1tn58ze)Smartphone and TV consumers also like quantum dots for their low price. A 65-inch quantum-dot display TV would cost about $3,500, half as much as an OLED-display model of the same size, said Nutmeg Consultants founder Ken Werner.Werner said quantum dots would retain that pricing advantage for at least three years.For that reason, the OLED market cannot match the growth rates forecast for quantum dots. Touch Display Research analyst Jennifer Colegrove said she expected a $9.6 billion market for quantum-dot displays and lighting components by 2023, compared with sales of just $75 million last year. (bit.ly/1mceJ7j)By contrast, Transparency Market Research projects annual sales of OLED displays at $25.9 billion by 2018 versus $4.9 billion in 2012.QUANTUM LEAP Although quantum dots have been in development since the 1980s, they have only made the leap from laboratory to market in the last decade.Nanosys shelved its plan to go public in 2004 for want of a viable product. Now the company says an initial public offering is its next step.

320,"   By Soham Chatterjee and Lehar Maan  Aug 13 When Amazon.com Inc was developing its most advanced tablet to date, it asked a little-known company to solve a tricky problem with the screen: how to produce rich colors without draining battery life.With the help of Milpitas, California-based Nanosys Inc, the Kindle Fire HDX 7 became one of Amazon's best-selling tablets, winning critical acclaim for its vibrant display.The answer? Quantum dots, which are semiconductor crystals 10,000 times finer than a human hair. They convert electrical energy into light and can be manipulated to produce precise colors.""If you put a regular LCD display next to a quantum-dot LCD display, your grandmother can tell the difference,"" said Jason Carlson, chief executive officer of QD Vision Inc, which makes quantum dots for Sony Corp's Triluminos TV.So explosive is demand for this technology that the few companies able to make quantum dots are struggling to keep up. Most are partnering with big display makers to set up industrial-scale manufacturing.QD Vision and Nanosys are considering going public in the next year or so.But while quantum dots are cheaper and consume less power than organic light-emitting diodes (OLED), their rival technology at the sharp end of the display business, they cannot yet be produced in the same quantities.Quantum dots from most suppliers also contain cadmium, a toxic metal whose use is restricted in many countries.A recent survey by DisplayMate Technologies rated Amazon's Kindle Fire display as the clear winner in color reproduction against Apple Inc's iPad mini and Google Inc's  Nexus 7. (bit.ly/1tn58ze)Smartphone and TV consumers also like quantum dots for their low price. A 65-inch quantum-dot display TV would cost about $3,500, half as much as an OLED-display model of the same size, said Nutmeg Consultants founder Ken Werner. Werner said quantum dots would retain that pricing advantage for at least three years.For that reason, the OLED market cannot match the growth rates forecast for quantum dots.Touch Display Research analyst Jennifer Colegrove said she expected a $9.6 billion market for quantum-dot displays and lighting components by 2023, compared with sales of just $75 million last year. (bit.ly/1mceJ7j)By contrast, Transparency Market Research projects annual sales of OLED displays at $25.9 billion by 2018 versus $4.9 billion in 2012.QUANTUM LEAP  Although quantum dots have been in development since the 1980s, they have only made the leap from laboratory to market in the last decade.Nanosys shelved its plan to go public in 2004 for want of a viable product.

328,"  (The author is a Reuters contributor. The opinions expressed are his own)By Mitch LipkaAug 14 With the cost of college textbooks surpassing $1,000 a year for many students, soon-to-be sophomore Matt Schroeder came up with a smart way to trim costs.He worked out a system of borrowing books from upperclassmen, offering nominal compensation to get them to delay selling them back.""My calculus book that usually costs $180, I got for the semester for $10 and a Chick-fil-A biscuit,"" says Schroeder, 19, who attends Covenant College in Georgia.Required texts for his last semester would have cost $430, he says. He spent $120.The College Board says the average student will spend more than $1,200 a year on textbooks and school supplies, but students have a variety of options for managing these costs.Online outlets and creative approaches like Schroeder's are increasingly the go-to choices for students. Renting textbooks is on the rise, allowing students to use a book for the semester, often at a significant discount to buying.Neebo Inc, which operates more than 250 campus bookstores, says textbook rentals have doubled since 2011. Industry research shows that about one-fourth of books at college bookstores in this past spring semester were rented, says Neebo Vice President Trevor Meyer.Fewer than half of all texts are purchased at campus bookstores, according to the National Association of College Stores trade association.Here is the 101 on the best ways to score a deal. BUYING ONLINE Some new book prices can be one-third of what you might find at the campus bookstore if you go online. The ninth edition of ""Calculus"" by Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards, and Robert Hostetler carries a list price of nearly $290 but can be purchased new for $239.99 at specialty textbook retailer Chegg.com.BUYING USED If you do not mind other people's notes or wear and tear, used texts are a good option. ""Calculus"" is selling for $93.49 used on Chegg.com.Matt Casaday, 25, a senior at Brigham Young University, says he had paid 42 cents on Amazon.com for a used copy of ""Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business."" The book was selling for $48 new. Academics like Ingrid Bracey, director of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst's College Without Walls, suggest students check with their professors to see if previous editions are acceptable. (Sometimes the updates are not relevant to the classwork.)If so, old editions can often be found for a tiny fraction of the cost of the latest version. Besides Chegg and Amazon, eBay Inc's Half.com is a popular alternative for used books.RENTING Renting your textbooks is worth considering if you take reasonable care of them, you remember to return them and you do not care to own them after you complete the class. You can save more than 80 percent of the cost of buying a book new. For example, a student could rent ""Calculus"" for the length of the semester for about $20.Know the rules of the store you rent from, including any penalties you could be assessed for taking notes, highlighting, or wear and tear.Renter, beware: If you fail to return the book, penalties can actually exceed the cost of buying it new.E-BOOKS Getting e-books instead of traditional texts is another option. Sometimes those books are essentially rented by providing the electronic license for a specific period from distributors such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc .Chegg will rent ""Calculus"" for six months for about $61.Bracey says students in literature classes can often find the best bargains since many classics are now available to download for free, while science and engineering texts can be extremely expensive.No matter what, shop around. Joe Gault, 29, who is about to enter Pepperdine Law School, recommends using the ISBN number to price books since it ensures you are shopping for the right text.Before ordering online, Gault says, be sure to check if the book is actually in stock. He learned that lesson the hard way. A book he purchased was back-ordered for four weeks, and he ended up paying full price at the college bookstore.

331,"  OSLO Brazil has made good progress in safeguarding the Amazon rainforest but Indonesia's plans for its forests could face setbacks under a new government, a report commissioned by top forest aid donor Norway said on Monday.Norway, rich from offshore oil and gas, paid 10.3 billion crowns ($1.7 billion) to slow tropical deforestation from 2008-13, according to the report by the state-funded Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (Norad).""Brazil’s deforestation rate and corresponding greenhouse gas emissions have strongly decreased,"" the report said of progress in protecting the Amazon, the biggest tropical forest.Projects funded by Norwegian cash in Brazil were ""paving the way for future reductions"", it said. Norway has paid Brazil 4.6 billion crowns ($720 million) to help back up domestic programs, it said.

332,"  OSLO Aug 18 Brazil has made good progress in safeguarding the Amazon rainforest but Indonesia's plans for its forests could face setbacks under a new government, a report commissioned by top forest aid donor Norway said on Monday.Norway, rich from offshore oil and gas, paid 10.3 billion crowns ($1.7 billion) to slow tropical deforestation from 2008-13, according to the report by the state-funded Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (Norad).""Brazil's deforestation rate and corresponding greenhouse gas emissions have strongly decreased,"" the report said of progress in protecting the Amazon, the biggest tropical forest.Projects funded by Norwegian cash in Brazil were ""paving the way for future reductions"", it said.Norway has paid Brazil 4.6 billion crowns ($720 million) to help back up domestic programmes, it said.

333,"  BEIJING Amazon.com will set up shop in China's Shanghai free trade zone, the company said on Wednesday, aiming to take advantage of less stringent trade regulations to sell a wider range of products in the country.The U.S. online retailer's move shows an intent not only to remain in China but to beef up its presence in an e-commerce market dominated by Alibaba Group Holding [IPO-BABA.N] and Beijing-based JD.com, the second-biggest player.    Amazon signed a memorandum of cooperation to give Chinese customers access to its products from its global supply chain and to help small and medium-sized enterprises in China to export their products to customers in other countries, the company said in an e-mailed statement.Amazon did not say when the company is likely to begin operations in the free trade zone, which enjoys more relaxed import and export regulations than the rest of China.The company is also pushing its Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud computing business in China and said in December that the country will have its own AWS region to improve speeds for its mainly corporate customers.However, persistent expansion has come at a cost, leaving Amazon with a $126 million net loss in the second quarter, up from a loss of $7 million in the same period last year. The company also forecast an operating loss of between $810 million and $410 million for the third quarter to Sept. 30, up from a $25 million loss a year ago.  'INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY'  ""I look forward to working with our Shanghai partners to realize the incredible opportunity of developing the best cross-border shopping experience possible for not only customers in China but also around the world and establishing Shanghai as a recognized international cross-border e-commerce center,"" said Diego Piacentini, Amazon's senior vice president of International Consumer Business.But Amazon has also been hit by counterfeit goods that frequently plague companies in China, from fashion to pharmaceuticals and even food and drink.In March Amazon said it will strengthen regulation of its online sales channels and had closed down a third-party store after state media criticized it for selling fake cosmetics.  Amazon's move to the free trade zone comes nearly a year after the zone was launched, attracting attention from overseas businesses and hailed as one of China's boldest reforms in decades. However, there has been a lack of specific policy details since the initial fanfare.Foreign banks, such as Citigroup and HSBC Holdings have set up branches in the zone, but many foreign companies have been reluctant to follow suit, citing a lack of clarity on what will and will not be allowed in the zone.

334,"  (In the 12th paragraph, corrects spelling of Casady to remove extra letter)By Mitch LipkaAug 14 With the cost of college textbooks surpassing $1,000 a year for many students, soon-to-be sophomore Matt Schroeder came up with a smart way to trim costs.He worked out a system of borrowing books from upperclassmen, offering nominal compensation to get them to delay selling them back.""My calculus book that usually costs $180, I got for the semester for $10 and a Chick-fil-A biscuit,"" says Schroeder, 19, who attends Covenant College in Georgia.Required texts for his last semester would have cost $430, he says. He spent $120.The College Board says the average student will spend more than $1,200 a year on textbooks and school supplies, but students have a variety of options for managing these costs.Online outlets and creative approaches like Schroeder's are increasingly the go-to choices for students. Renting textbooks is on the rise, allowing students to use a book for the semester, often at a significant discount to buying.Neebo Inc, which operates more than 250 campus bookstores, says textbook rentals have doubled since 2011. Industry research shows that about one-fourth of books at college bookstores in this past spring semester were rented, says Neebo Vice President Trevor Meyer.Fewer than half of all texts are purchased at campus bookstores, according to the National Association of College Stores trade association.Here is the 101 on the best ways to score a deal. BUYING ONLINE Some new book prices can be one-third of what you might find at the campus bookstore if you go online. The ninth edition of ""Calculus"" by Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards, and Robert Hostetler carries a list price of nearly $290 but can be purchased new for $239.99 at specialty textbook retailer Chegg.com.BUYING USED If you do not mind other people's notes or wear and tear, used texts are a good option. ""Calculus"" is selling for $93.49 used on Chegg.com.Matt Casady, 25, a senior at Brigham Young University, says he had paid 42 cents on Amazon.com for a used copy of ""Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business."" The book was selling for $48 new. Academics like Ingrid Bracey, director of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst's College Without Walls, suggest students check with their professors to see if previous editions are acceptable. (Sometimes the updates are not relevant to the classwork.)If so, old editions can often be found for a tiny fraction of the cost of the latest version. Besides Chegg and Amazon, eBay Inc's Half.com is a popular alternative for used books.RENTING Renting your textbooks is worth considering if you take reasonable care of them, you remember to return them and you do not care to own them after you complete the class. You can save more than 80 percent of the cost of buying a book new. For example, a student could rent ""Calculus"" for the length of the semester for about $20.Know the rules of the store you rent from, including any penalties you could be assessed for taking notes, highlighting, or wear and tear.Renter, beware: If you fail to return the book, penalties can actually exceed the cost of buying it new.E-BOOKS Getting e-books instead of traditional texts is another option. Sometimes those books are essentially rented by providing the electronic license for a specific period from distributors such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc .Chegg will rent ""Calculus"" for six months for about $61.Bracey says students in literature classes can often find the best bargains since many classics are now available to download for free, while science and engineering texts can be extremely expensive.No matter what, shop around. Joe Gault, 29, who is about to enter Pepperdine Law School, recommends using the ISBN number to price books since it ensures you are shopping for the right text.Before ordering online, Gault says, be sure to check if the book is actually in stock. He learned that lesson the hard way. A book he purchased was back-ordered for four weeks, and he ended up paying full price at the college bookstore.

338,"   By Astrid Zweynert  LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The conservation of Brazil's Amazon is threatened by the poor social conditions of its 24 million inhabitants, the first comprehensive study measuring the situation found on Saturday.Lack of access to clean water, violence, illiteracy and limited opportunities to pursue a better life are among the problems highlighted in the Social Progress Index (SPI) for the Amazon, one of the world's most important ecosystems.The study paints a picture of social injustice and inequality by charting data from all but one of the region's 773 municipalities and nine states. Researchers hope it will become a tool for improving development policy as Brazil elects a new president in October.Beto Verissimo, one of the study's authors and lead researcher at the Amazon Institute of People and the Environment (Imazon), said the findings raise the question of whether the biodiversity of the Amazon can be protected if the people living there continue to struggle on the very basic measures.""From access to clean water and basic education to personal choice and rights, the citizens of this region, on average, experience significantly lower social progress compared to people living in the rest of Brazil,"" Verissimo told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in a telephone interview.The Amazon SPI studied more than 40 indicators, including maternal mortality, access to piped water, secondary school enrolment, deforestation, malaria incidence, child and teenage pregnancies and violence against indigenous people and women.Nearly all of the Amazon municipalities have a social progress score below the national average, according to the index examined in the study that was published in partnership with non-profit Social Progress Imperative. ""It is almost like two different countries when you look at the Amazon region and at Brazil as a whole,"" said Verissimo. ""Despite some government efforts to close the gap, progress in the rest of the country has been faster than in the Amazon. It would take 10 to 15 years of social investment to change this.""The study follows the release of the 2014 global SPI, developed by Social Progress Imperative, which ranked Brazil 46th out of 132 countries. It measures social and environmental performance rather than economic output in a drive to make social progress a priority for politicians and businesses.Brazil's score of 67.7 compared to more than 88 for the top ranking New Zealand, mostly due to problems with personal safety and lack of access to advanced education.The country has also faced social unrest as Amazon tribes protest against what they see as the steady undermining of their rights to ancestral lands by farmers. The rainforest is threatened by unsustainable logging, infrastructure development and agricultural expansion. SOCIAL PROBLEMS ACROSS THE AMAZON The Amazon scored most poorly in the category ""opportunity"", which includes personal rights, freedom and choice as well as tolerance, inclusion and access to advanced education. The region scored 48.3, compared to 61.2 for the country as a whole. Acre, on the border with Peru and Bolivia, had the lowest score of the Amazon's nine states. Only 39 percent of its 760,000 population has access to clean water, 24 percent is illiterate and it recorded twice the average rate of violence against women.In Amazonas, Brazil's biggest state with a population of almost 4 million, some 15 percent of 10-14 year olds have to work to survive and 15 percent of girls aged 15 to 17 years are mothers. Only 37 percent of women complete a basic education.Even areas that rank above the Amazonian average face formidable social challenges.The city of Manaus, for example, has a rate of 56.5 homicides per 100,000 residents, more than twice the national average. Violence against women is double the average of the Amazon at 160 cases per 100,000 residents.The next survey is due in 2016, Verissimo said. ""It will be a powerful tool to track progress,"" he added.

Amazon apparently beat out tech rival Google Inc , which was previously in talks to buy Twitch - launched in June 2011, one person briefed on the deal said. Amazon has been spending more on original television and gaming content over the last several years. It will spend $100 million on original content alone in the third quarter.""It's clear that Amazon will want to find more content that it can control,"" Forrester Research analyst James McQuivey said.""Twitch is a good fit this way because it captures people's attention for hours a week and it also creates a product tie-in opportunity that Amazon can capitalize on in a way that Google could not,"" he added. Twitch's format, which lets viewers message players and each other during live play, is garnering interest as one of the fastest-growing segments of digital video streaming, which in turn is attracting more and more advertising dollars.More than 55 million unique visitors viewed more than 15 billion minutes of content on Twitch in July. ""Broadcasting and watching gameplay is a global phenomenon and Twitch has built a platform that brings together tens of millions of people who watch billions of minutes of games each month - from 'The International,' to breaking the world record for 'Mario,' to gaming conferences like E3,"" Chief Executive Jeff Bezos said in a statement.Twitch raised $20 million in funding last September from game publisher Take-Two Interactive Software and firms such as Bessemer Venture Partners and Thrive Capital.""We're keeping most everything the same: our office, our employees, our brand, and most importantly our independence,"" Emmett Shear, CEO, said in a blog post. ""But with Amazon's support we'll have the resources to bring you an even better Twitch.""Investors have noticed Twitch's rapid growth, from some 3.2 million players when it initially launched in 2011. Some of its most-followed players rake in six-figure salaries through a 50-50 split in advertising revenue, $5 monthly subscriptions to livestream channels, and even spontaneous donations from fans.

The San Francisco-based startup lets gamers livecast their play while responding to cheers, tips and random musings from online viewers in real time.In three years, Twitch has become the fourth largest U.S. producer of peak Internet traffic, ahead of Facebook and Hulu, according to Bessemer, a backer.""It's a captive audience and one that is loyal,"" said Adam Shlachter, head of media activation at marketing agency DigitasLBi. ""Where you have like-minded people..all aggregated in one place, kind of holed up around the same thing and participating in the same experiences, that offers a really unique environment to target (ads) against.""Live-streaming draws a following partly because of its immediacy: fans message their favorite personalities and can evoke a response during livecasts.

That growth caught the attention of advertisers, who spotted the chance to reach younger viewers who watch less television.Brands will spend $6 billion this year on digital video advertising in the United States, according to research firm eMarketer.

On live platforms like Twitch, ads appear as a user opens a stream or when livecasters take a break. ""Interacting with celebrities and artists is a growing trend,"" said Max Haot, chief executive of Livestream.BEYOND GAMING Twitch is adding staff with expertise in programmatic ad buying, which uses computers to sell ads in real time, Twitch's chief revenue officer, Jonathan Simpson-Bint, told Reuters this month. That will give advertisers the option to insert commercials into Twitch videos that see a sudden surge of viewership. It's also branching out into music events.""Amazon has a direct media sales group of its own...I think our ad sales numbers will be accelerated by the fact that we are going to have access to resources of Amazon,"" Twitch's chief executive Emmett Shear said.Twitch's breakneck growth is now propelling the live streaming video format beyond gaming and pushing media companies and YouTube personalities to test it out.Discovery Communications Inc's hosts a monthly Google+ Hangout with NASA scientists and Animal Planet live streams events like the Internet Cat Video Festival in Minnesota. Discovery plans to invest in more interactive streaming events to help build a ""two-way"" relationship with viewers, said Sean Atkins, senior vice president of digital media.Tom Cote, co-host of ""Funny Stuff & Cheese,"" an independent online comedy series that streamed over a hundred shows live during its first season, says his fans like that they can ask a question and get a response within minutes.The format has its challenges.

On live platforms such as Twitch, ads appear as a user opens a stream or when livecasters take a break.""Interacting with celebrities and artists is a growing trend,"" said Max Haot, chief executive of Livestream. BEYOND GAMING Twitch is adding staff with expertise in programmatic ad buying, which uses computers to sell ads in real time, Twitch's chief revenue officer, Jonathan Simpson-Bint, told Reuters this month. That will give advertisers the option to insert commercials into Twitch videos that see a sudden surge in viewership. It's also branching out into music events.""Amazon has a direct media sales group of its own...I think our ad sales numbers will be accelerated by the fact that we are going to have access to resources of Amazon,"" Twitch chief executive Emmett Shear said.Twitch's breakneck growth is now propelling the live streaming video format beyond gaming and pushing media companies and YouTube personalities to test it.Discovery Communications Inc hosts a monthly Google+ Hangout with NASA scientists and Animal Planet live streams events such as the Internet Cat Video Festival in Minnesota. Discovery plans to invest in more interactive streaming events to help build a ""two-way"" relationship with viewers, said Sean Atkins, senior vice president of digital media.Tom Cote, co-host of ""Funny Stuff & Cheese,"" an independent online comedy series that streamed over a hundred shows live during its first season, says his fans like the fact that they can ask a question and get a response within minutes.The format has its challenges. It takes creators time to find a groove and overcome technical glitches, Cote said. And there's no chance for editing or retakes.""It will be widespread,"" he said. ""Right now, I think people don't have the confidence to go live. It's a whole different beast than traditional video.""

355,"   By Deepa Seetharaman and Malathi Nayak | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Amazon.com Inc snapped up live-streaming gaming network Twitch Interactive for about $970 million in cash, reflecting Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos' resolve to transform Amazon into an Internet destination beyond its core retail operations.The move, announced by the two companies on Monday, is the largest deal in Amazon's 20-year history and will help the U.S. e-commerce company vie with Apple Inc and Google Inc in the fast-growing world of online gaming, which accounts for more than 75 percent of all mobile app sales.The acquisition involves some retention agreements that push the deal over $1 billion, a source close to the deal told Reuters.""Twitch will further push Amazon into the gaming community while also helping it with video and advertising,"" Macquarie Research analyst Ben Schachter said in a note.Twitch's format, which lets viewers message players and each other during live play, is garnering interest as one of the fastest-growing segments of digital video streaming, which in turn is attracting more and more advertising dollars.The deal, expected to close in the second half of the year, is an unusual step for Amazon, which tends to build from within or make smaller acquisitions. Tech rival Google was earlier in talks to buy Twitch, which launched slightly more than three years ago, one person briefed on the deal said.Neither Amazon nor Twitch would discuss how the deal came together or comment on Google's interest. In an interview, Twitch Chief Executive Officer Emmett Shear said the startup contacted Amazon because its deep pockets and ad sales expertise would allow the startup to pursue its strategic objectives more quickly.""The reason why we reached out to Amazon, the reason I thought working for Amazon, having Twitch being a part of Amazon, would be a great idea for us (because) they would give us the resources to pursue these things that we honestly already want to pursue and they'd let us do it faster,"" Shear said.Ethan Kurzweil, a partner at Bessemer Ventures, which has backed Twitch since its earliest days, said Amazon's expertise in developer platforms through Amazon Web Services gave it a window into Twitch's potential growth.""They understand the power of engaged developer platforms,"" he said, noting Twitch's popularity with game developers and publishers was as important as its popularity with consumers. Bessemer provided Twitch an introduction to Frank Quattrone, a banker at boutique investment bank Qatalyst Partners, with a view to ""catalyzing interest in Twitch,"" Kurzweil said.Quattrone advised Amazon on its 1997 initial public offering.Twitch raised $20 million in funding last September from game publisher Take-Two Interactive Software and firms such as Bessemer Venture Partners and Thrive Capital. Other venture backers include Alsop Louie Partners and Draper Associates.More than 55 million unique visitors viewed more than 15 billion minutes of content on Twitch in July.Some video game live casters on Twitch have embedded links to the Amazon's online store. Analysts said the deal may result in more product tie-ins and a deeper integration with Amazon Instant Video and Amazon devices like the Kindle Fire tablet and recently launched Fire TV set-top box.Twitch and Amazon did not disclose details on new retail opportunities for Amazon through Twitch’s network of gamers.""We have lots of ideas we've discussed, there's a lot of interest and a number of things we can pursue,"" Michael Frazzini, VP of Amazon Games, said in an interview.

356,"  WASHINGTON, Sept 2 The Washington Post's owner, Amazon.com Inc founder Jeff Bezos, has named a former executive from rival Politico as publisher of the 137-year-old newspaper, replacing Katharine Weymouth.Frederick J. Ryan Jr. will lead the paper, the Washington Post said in a statement on Tuesday. His appointment ends 80 years of control by the Graham family after Weymouth's great-grandfather bought the newspaper at a 1933 auction, according to a separate report in the Post.""This is just the beginning of a wonderful new chapter for The Post,"" Weymouth said in the statement.The move also seals in a new era for the media organization marked last year when Bezos announced plans to buy the newspaper. The purchase by the wealth technology visionary was seen as a another sign of the steep challenges newspapers face amid declining advertising revenue and readership even as it sparked hope that so-called ""old media"" could reboot in the face of rapidly changing technology.""This is an incredibly exciting time for all of us in media,"" Ryan said in the statement.""The Washington Post is a crown jewel, exemplifying the finest in editorial quality and journalistic values,"" he said, adding that he was ""honored to follow four generations of Graham family leadership."" Ryan left Politico, owned by Allbritton Communications, last month after announcing his planned departure in 2013.Politico, seen as the Post's main competitor for political coverage, was founded by two former Washington Post reporters.Ryan said in an interview with the Washington Post that the newspaper has made much progress in growing its digital readership, and that he would seek to continue its ""growth strategy,"" including investing in innovation. ""You don't shrink your way to success,"" he said, according to the paper.He is expected to start on Oct. 1, the company said.""I know he's excited to meet the team and roll up his sleeves,"" Bezos said in the statement. Ryan, 59, served as an administration official under President Ronald Reagan and is chairman of the White House Historical Association and the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library Foundation, according to the paper's report.A graduate of the University of Southern California, he has edited two books about Reagan, and serves on the board of the university's Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, it said.The Post has received some criticism over the years for having a more liberal bent compared with other publications such as the Washington Times.Its executive editor, Martin Baron, told the paper that he did not see any political implications for its newsroom from the appointment.""Our news coverage aims to be fair, honest and accurate,"" he said, according to the report, adding that the paper is ""nonideological"" and ""will remain that way.""

365,"   By Jeremy Wagstaff, Maria Kiselyova and Emma Thomasson | SINGAPORE/MOSCOW/BERLIN  SINGAPORE/MOSCOW/BERLIN Germany's Rocket Internet faces daunting logistical challenges and rising local competition from Lagos to Laos as it races to capture customers in emerging markets before e-commerce titans Amazon and Alibaba can catch up.    That spells mounting losses as the venture capital company gears up to launch an initial public offering (IPO) this month that will help provide the war chest it needs to build and defend what it hopes will be the largest online shopping empire outside the United States and China.    Chief Executive Oliver Samwer, who founded Rocket Internet in 2007 with his brothers Alexander and Marc, sees huge opportunities for digital businesses in emerging markets, noting that the cities with the most active Facebook users are Bangkok, Jakarta and Istanbul - with no U.S. city in the top 10.    ""We like to collect countries, small markets that together can create a giant,"" he told a retail conference in June.    But while Rocket Internet has launched about 70 companies - ranging from online fashion to food delivery and marketplaces for real estate - in more than 100 countries, many in the last couple of years, it is still far from being a giant.     Rocket's top eight e-commerce ventures in emerging markets - including Lamoda in Russia, Dafiti in Brazil and Zalora in Southeast Asia - together made sales of 539 million euros ($708 million) in 2013 and an operating loss of 351 million, according to figures from major Swedish investor AB Kinnevik.    That compares with the $2.54 billion revenue that 15-year-old Chinese e-commerce juggernaut Alibaba reported for the quarter ended June 30. Alibaba's net income attributable to ordinary shareholders nearly tripled to $1.99 billion.    The Rocket businesses are growing fast - revenue was up 74 percent in 2013 - and they have succeeded in attracting over 1 billion euros in capital from a raft of high-profile investors - most recently German service provider United Internet AG and Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company.But they face a rocky road, not least due to competition from Alibaba [IPO-ALIB.N] itself as the Chinese firm - soon to be bolstered by funds from a bumper listing - looks for new opportunities outside its home market.The Samwer brothers have gained notoriety for cloning businesses pioneered in Silicon Valley in new markets - most notably German online auction site Alando which they sold to eBay, the site it was modelled on; and Amazon Zappos-copy Zalando, now Europe's biggest online fashion site which is on track to list soon.     Rocket's strategy is to identify markets and niches where big players have yet to get established, cutting its losses if the competitive environment turns out to be too fierce, as it did in 2012 when it closed down operations in Turkey.It says it can launch a company within 100 days by drawing on expertise in areas like legal, finance, communications, marketing and business intelligence at its Berlin head office, helping it start an average of three to six new firms a year. It aims for its ventures to be operationally independent within another 100 days - but can pull the plug if the business is failing, as they have done in about 20 percent of cases. ""BEAT THEM ON BRANDING""     In Russia and Brazil, home to the two Rocket businesses with the highest sales in 2013, Alibaba's AliExpress is already a force to be reckoned with: it is No. 2 shopping site in Brazil behind local firm MercardoLivre and no. 2 in Russia behind Avito, according to web traffic measurement firm SimilarWeb.    In those markets, Rocket has sought to focus on fashion with its Dafiti and Lamoda sites rather than the general merchandise of AliExpress. Dafiti is No. 16 overall in e-commerce in Brazil, but is No. 1 in online fashion. In Russia, Lamoda is at No. 15 - but in fashion, it is No. 2 behind local rival Wildberries.In Southeast Asia, Rocket has had a freer run to do both fashion with Zalora and general wares with Lazada, although Alibaba has positioned itself to expand in the region by taking a stake in logistics firm Singapore Post.    ""They are smart to go into markets where most other big players don't have a footprint and (elsewhere) round out the offers of Alibaba and Amazon,"" said Forrester e-commerce research director Zia Wigder.    ""In Brazil there are lots of companies selling consumer electronics, but apparel is much less well penetrated.""    Rocket has the top e-commerce sites in terms of overall rankings in Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand, while its Jabong fashion site ranks No. 2 among all e-commerce sites in India. In Malaysia, Lazada is No. 3 shopping site and Zalora is No. 1 in fashion, according to SimilarWeb measurements.    ""You cannot think of beating the Chinese on cash, because they have so much of it,"" Giulio Xiloyannis, managing director of Zalora Malaysia, told Reuters. ""You beat them on branding and product quality.""     To that end, the Rocket online fashion stores are investing in building their own fashion labels and spending on advertising, a lesson learnt from Zalando, which gained widespread recognition in Europe with its ""scream for joy"" slogan and ads showing delighted shoppers ripping open parcels.    Rocket is also spending heavily on building warehouses and developing delivery networks, particularly in countries like Vietnam, Thailand and Nigeria with poor local infrastructure.The firm announced plans on Thursday to bring together its five emerging market fashion brands to create a company worth 2.7 billion euros ($3.6 billion) and simplify its structure before a likely stock market listing. It wants the five to collaborate on sourcing and share expertise in areas such as building delivery networks, creating their own fashion labels and developing mobile applications.       TRY-ON SERVICE     Online fashion store Lamoda in Russia is leading the way in many of those areas. It expects to have over 1,000 delivery staff and more than 500 vehicles by the end of 2014 and over 2,000 staff by 2015 as it seeks to reach more clients in such a vast country. It also wants to distinguish itself by offering a free try-on service at the door.     ""It has been a very tough challenge here in Russia to create great customer experience, but this try-on concept, this interaction with the customer at the door ... creates a very high barrier for anybody who wants to offer the same level of service,"" said Lamoda Chief Executive Nils Tonsen.    ""E-commerce penetration in Russia should be higher than in the U.S. because offline retail infrastructure in Russia is much less developed,"" he said. ""This is something that gives you so much potential going forward.""    However, that potential is attracting rivals like   Wildberries, which boasts the top downloaded iPhone app in the country, according to SimilarWeb.    Krzysztof Kaczmarek, a Manila-based e-commerce consultant, sees problems with the standard Rocket delivery model, particularly cash-on-delivery orders.In many markets where Rocket firms operate, credit-card ownership is rare and shoppers prefer to pay in cash on the doorstep. That helps explain why e-commerce has been slow to take off in Latin America, apart from Brazil where cards are more common and online sales have reached $12 billion a year.    ""It's very easy to order anything from the online store and then to refuse the payment. If it happens, the merchant has to cover both the shipment and the unsuccessful delivery costs,"" Kaczmarek said. ""It ... requires exceptional processes to control the size of the stock and the management of new orders.""Rocket Internet spokesman Andreas Winiarski says the company sees its cash-on-delivery offer as a key competitive advantage.

Alibaba's net income attributable to ordinary shareholders nearly tripled to $1.99 billion.The Rocket businesses are growing fast - revenue was up 74 percent in 2013 - and they have succeeded in attracting over 1 billion euros in capital from a raft of high-profile investors - most recently German service provider United Internet AG  and Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company.But they face a rocky road, not least due to competition from Alibaba itself as the Chinese firm - soon to be bolstered by funds from a bumper listing - looks for new opportunities outside its home market.The Samwer brothers have gained notoriety for cloning businesses pioneered in Silicon Valley in new markets - most notably German online auction site Alando which they sold to eBay, the site it was modelled on; and Amazon  Zappos-copy Zalando, now Europe's biggest online fashion site which is on track to list soon. Rocket's strategy is to identify markets and niches where big players have yet to get established, cutting its losses if the competitive environment turns out to be too fierce, as it did in 2012 when it closed down operations in Turkey.It says it can launch a company within 100 days by drawing on expertise in areas like legal, finance, communications, marketing and business intelligence at its Berlin head office, helping it start an average of three to six new firms a year.It aims for its ventures to be operationally independent within another 100 days - but can pull the plug if the business is failing, as they have done in about 20 percent of cases.""BEAT THEM ON BRANDING"" In Russia and Brazil, home to the two Rocket businesses with the highest sales in 2013, Alibaba's AliExpress is already a force to be reckoned with: it is No. 2 shopping site in Brazil behind local firm MercardoLivre and no. 2 in Russia behind Avito, according to web traffic measurement firm SimilarWeb.In those markets, Rocket has sought to focus on fashion with its Dafiti and Lamoda sites rather than the general merchandise of AliExpress. Dafiti is No. 16 overall in e-commerce in Brazil, but is No. 1 in online fashion. In Russia, Lamoda is at No. 15 - but in fashion, it is No. 2 behind local rival Wildberries.In Southeast Asia, Rocket has had a freer run to do both fashion with Zalora and general wares with Lazada, although Alibaba has positioned itself to expand in the region by taking a stake in logistics firm Singapore Post. ""They are smart to go into markets where most other big players don't have a footprint and (elsewhere) round out the offers of Alibaba and Amazon,"" said Forrester e-commerce research director Zia Wigder.""In Brazil there are lots of companies selling consumer electronics, but apparel is much less well penetrated.""Rocket has the top e-commerce sites in terms of overall rankings in Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand, while its Jabong fashion site ranks No. 2 among all e-commerce sites in India.

""You beat them on branding and product quality.""To that end, the Rocket online fashion stores are investing in building their own fashion labels and spending on advertising, a lesson learnt from Zalando, which gained widespread recognition in Europe with its ""scream for joy"" slogan and ads showing delighted shoppers ripping open parcels.Rocket is also spending heavily on building warehouses and developing delivery networks, particularly in countries like Vietnam, Thailand and Nigeria with poor local infrastructure.The firm announced plans on Thursday to bring together its five emerging market fashion brands to create a company worth 2.7 billion euros ($3.6 billion) and simplify its structure before a likely stock market listing. It wants the five to collaborate on sourcing and share expertise in areas such as building delivery networks, creating their own fashion labels and developing mobile applications.TRY-ON SERVICE Online fashion store Lamoda in Russia is leading the way in many of those areas. It expects to have over 1,000 delivery staff and more than 500 vehicles by the end of 2014 and over 2,000 staff by 2015 as it seeks to reach more clients in such a vast country. It also wants to distinguish itself by offering a free try-on service at the door.""It has been a very tough challenge here in Russia to create great customer experience, but this try-on concept, this interaction with the customer at the door ... creates a very high barrier for anybody who wants to offer the same level of service,"" said Lamoda Chief Executive Nils Tonsen.""E-commerce penetration in Russia should be higher than in the U.S. because offline retail infrastructure in Russia is much less developed,"" he said.

367,"   By Mitra Taj | ALTO MADRE DE DIOS RIVER Peru  ALTO MADRE DE DIOS RIVER Peru Six Mashco Piro tribeswomen crouched low as they escaped back into the jungle after raiding a remote lodge in Peru's Manu National Park in the western Amazon, clutching newly prized tools: metallic cooking pots.The brazen daytime foray into the tourist retreat in May was a rare appearance by one of the world’s most reclusive tribes that is increasingly chancing contact with the outside world.The Mashco Piro have clashed in the past with loggers, poachers and drug traffickers who invaded their jungle enclaves, but anthropologists say the lure of modern tools is now tempting them closer than ever to far-flung villages and tourist camps. ""It's a technological revolution,"" said anthropologist Klaus Rummenhoeller, who has been studying Amazonian tribes in Peru since the 1980s. ""Imagine you live in the wild and only have stone axes, and then you're given machetes.""Their sorties are dangerous, exposing them to the threat of violent encounters with terrified locals and modern-day diseases against which the hunter-gatherers have little immunity.The Mashco Piro have historically rejected outsiders, surviving enslavement during Peru's bloody rubber boom in the late 1800s and rebuffing the advances of Christian missionaries throughout the last century.But in the past three years there has been a spike in sightings near the Manu National Park as the Mashco Piro, clad only in loin cloths and armed with bows and arrows, emerge during the dry season in clearings along the Alto Madre de Dios River. ""They sounded like birds,"" said Guillermina Loaiza, a cook at the lodge who disturbed the tribeswomen as they rifled through her kitchen during the recent raid. ""I thought it was another tourism agency playing a practical joke.""The tribe is estimated to number no more than 600 and is split into several groups who constantly move through the jungle, occasionally constructing makeshift shelters on river banks where they dig for turtle eggs.  Peru's government prohibits physical contact with the Mashco Piro and another dozen so-called ""uncontacted"" indigenous tribes, primarily for their wellbeing. Their immune systems carry little resistance to illnesses that other humans carry.""It's extremely urgent because there are more of them every time, and it's a relatively highly transited area,"" said government anthropologist Luis Felipe Torres. ""Anything could happen.""DISEASE THREAT  Torres said a Catholic priest and mayor of one local town in Peru's eastern reaches near the border with Brazil were among a small group who had tried to tempt the Mashco Piro out of their hideouts with rewards, pitying their primitive existence.Authorities say they can do little to prevent individuals ignoring the contact ban because there is no penalty attached. Instead, armed with a budget of just $600,000 a year, a government team tasked with preventing the Mashco Piro and other uncontacted tribes succumbing to modern diseases strives to dissuade outsiders from making contact.  It has happened before. In the 1980s, human-carried germs wiped out half of Peru's Yora tribe after illegal loggers penetrated deep in the forest along roads built to facilitate oil and gas exploration.Three years ago, doctor Fernando Mendieta helped prevent an outbreak of respiratory infections wreaking havoc among a group of semi-isolated of Machiguenga Indians after a Canadian searching for a lost Inca city passed through their village. But Mendieta said he would be wary of treating the Mashco Piro because of their aggressive reputation. They killed one local man and wounded a park ranger with arrows in 2011.""I'm not going to be the first one to try and inject a Mashco Piro with a shot,"" Mendieta said. The government task force is erecting signs warning against approaching the Mashco Piro, but it may be too late to halt a rising trend.""They should have put up the signs before, when they (Mashco Piro) first started showing up,"" said Romeria Rivera, a leader in the village of Shipetiari where the wooden huts are raised on stilts to avoid flooding.    Wanting to placate the Mashco Piro, locals in the nearby town of Diamante at times leave machetes and bananas out on the shore of Alto Madre de Dios River, said logger Henry Bonifacio.    ""Once, we left them a cold soda,"" Bonifacio said. ""One man grabbed it, felt the cold and then dropped it and left.""

372,"   By Teppei Kasai | TOKYO  TOKYO Japanese e-commerce firm Rakuten Inc (4755.T) said on Tuesday it would buy U.S. Internet discounter Ebates Inc for $1 billion, extending an acquisition spree in a deal whose logic has been questioned by analysts and investors alike.The move underlines Rakuten's ambitions to grow overseas after recent international purchases worth over $1.2 billion. But shares in Japan's biggest e-commerce firm have fallen 5.4 percent since it said over the weekend it was considering the deal amid doubts about how it beds in another big acquisition.Hiroshi Mikitani, Rakuten's billionaire chief executive, said on Tuesday the purchase was an opportunity for his company to get access to Ebates' U.S. customers. The San Francisco-based firm operates websites handling rebates and coupons issued by retailers like Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and Best Buy Co Inc (BBY.N).The deal is in line with Mikitani's plans to reduce Rakuten's reliance on the domestic market.

But observers like Hiroyuki Fukunaga, CEO of investment advisors Investrust, have questioned the value of the Ebates acquisition. ""Investors will wonder whether this deal would be cost-effective when in the U.S. there's already a giant like Amazon,"" Fukunaga said.High-profile acquisitions in recent years have included free messaging application Viber for $900 million, and Canadian e-book reader Kobo for $315 million. Mikitani is trying to transform Rakuten from a pure e-commerce firm into a one-stop-site for a global audience, along the lines of Amazon. Rakuten already offers online services such as financing, travel, shopping and online video. It also recently announced it would set up a Japanese low-cost carrier with Malaysian budget carrier Air Asia. ""Mikitani keeps doing bolt-on acquisitions,"" said a person with direct knowledge of Rakuten's acquisitions. ""He doesn't necessarily have a big plan on what he wants to do with all of the deals.

374,"   By Marcelo Teixeira | SAO PAULO  SAO PAULO The destruction of the world's largest rainforest accelerated last year with a 29 percent spike in deforestation, according to final figures released by the Brazilian government on Wednesday that confirmed a reversal in gains seen since 2009. Satellite data for the 12 months through the end of July 2013 showed that 5,891 square km (3,360 square miles) of forest were cleared in the Brazilian Amazon, an area half the size of Puerto Rico.Fighting the destruction of the Amazon is considered crucial for reducing global warming because deforestation worldwide accounts for 15 percent of annual emissions of heat-trapping gases, more than the entire transportation sector. Besides being a giant carbon sink, the Amazon is a biodiversity sanctuary, holding billions of species yet to be studied. Preliminary data released late last year by Brazil's space research center INPE had indicated deforestation was on the rise again, as conservationist groups had warned.  The largest increases in deforestation were seen in the states of Para and Mato Grosso, where the bulk of Brazil's agricultural expansion is taking place. More than 1,000 square km (390 square miles) has been cleared in each state.Other reasons for the rebound in deforestation include illegal logging and the invasion of public lands adjacent to big infrastructure projects in the Amazon, such as roads and hydroelectric dams. Despite the increase in 2013, the cleared area is still the second-lowest annual figure since the Brazilian government began tracking deforestation in 2004, when almost 30,000 square km (11,580 square miles) of forest were lost.The Brazilian government frequently launches police operations to fight illegal loggers in the forest, but environmentalists say more is needed. Reuters last week published photographs of Amazon Indians who captured, stripped and beat illegal loggers on their reservation in Para. The tribe decided to take enforcement into its own hands, arguing that Brazilian authorities were not doing their job.

378,"   By Emma Thomasson | BERLIN  BERLIN German venture capital firm Rocket Internet unveiled plans for a stock market listing that could value the company behind dozens of online start-ups at $6.5 billion, riding a wave of e-commerce flotations.Rocket's announcement on Wednesday of plans to raise about 750 million euros by selling new shares pits it against Europe's biggest online fashion firm Zalando and China's Alibaba IPO-BABA.N in the quest for investors this month. Alibaba's initial public offering is expected to cap the flurry as the biggest technology flotation ever, surpassing Facebook Inc's (FB.O) $16 billion listing in 2012, while Zalando's share sale would value it at about $5.8 billion.  Berlin-based Rocket said in a statement its offer would consist solely of new shares and it would use the proceeds to fund growth by launching new businesses and providing more capital to its existing companies.A source with knowledge of the plans said Rocket planned to list a stake of about 15 percent, giving the group a total value of some 5 billion euros ($6.5 billion).Rocket Internet wants to replicate the success of Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and Alibaba in markets the U.S. and Chinese e-commerce groups have yet to dominate, such as Africa, Latin America, Russia and other parts of Asia.Founded in 2007 by brothers Oliver, Alexander and Marc Samwer, Rocket is active in more than 100 countries, with sales of $1 billion in 2013 via e-commerce and online marketplaces for everything from taxis to meal deliveries.""We believe the Internet will play a transformational role in people's lives everywhere, particularly in emerging markets,"" said Oliver Samwer, chief executive, adding he was not concerned about competing with Alibaba for attention.""Ultimately we are a very unique story ... We believe investors will value the exposure that they can get through us to those fastest growing markets."" The Samwer brothers own 52.3 percent of the existing Rocket stock and hold 17 percent of Zalando, a company Rocket helped launch, so the two listings would make them billionaires.The Rocket businesses have succeeded in attracting a raft of high-profile investors - most recently securing 768 million euros from German service provider United Internet AG (UTDI.DE) and Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company.BIGGEST IN EUROPE  The Rocket and Zalando listings are the biggest technology offerings in Germany since the bursting of the dot-com bubble more than a decade ago and the Rocket flotation would be the biggest in Europe since Russia's Yandex in 2011. Rocket is expected by analysts to appeal more to technology or emerging market funds, and Zalando to those looking for exposure to booming e-commerce in Europe. Zalando hopes to raise more than 500 million euros by listing a stake of 10-11 percent.""Rocket has an extremely interesting business model - they are taking quite simple business models which work well in Europe and launching them in emerging markets,"" said analyst Bjorn Gustafsson, analyst at brokerage Kepler Cheuvreux. The Samwer brothers have gained notoriety for cloning businesses pioneered in Silicon Valley in new markets, such as a German online auction site which they sold to eBay Inc (EBAY.O) and Zalando, inspired by Amazon-owned fashion site Zappos. Rocket says it can launch a company within 100 days by drawing on expertise in areas such as finance, communications, marketing and business intelligence at its Berlin head office, helping it start an average of three to six new firms a year.Rocket plans to apply to list its shares in Frankfurt via the ""entry standard"", which requires less detailed financial information than the ""general"" or ""prime"" standard that Rocket hopes to reach within 18-24 months.Rocket has released limited financial details so far. Its top 10 e-commerce ventures - including fashion sites such as Lamoda in Russia and online furniture stores Home24 - had sales of 743 million euros in 2013 and an operating loss of 431.6 million, according to figures from major investor Kinnevik. Samwer said Rocket would publish more figures with its listing prospectus and would report results on a half-yearly basis in future, but said profits were not an immediate goal.""We are in a high growth phase and investing for growth ... we do have a clear path to long-term profitability,"" he said.Rocket's six main shareholders - including Sweden's Kinnevik (KINVb.ST) and the Samwer brothers' fund - would sign lock-up commitments not to sell their shares for at least 12 months.Kinnevik, a major investor in Rocket and Zalando, has seen its shares soar in the last year as investors sought exposure to e-commerce but analysts say it might lose some appeal now both are firms listing. The stock was down 0.3 percent at 0804 EDT.Last week, Rocket and Kinnevik announced plans to combine Rocket's five emerging market online fashion start-ups to create a new group they said was worth 2.7 billion euros, but Samwer declined to comment on speculation they might ultimately spin out that business from Rocket. Berenberg, JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley are joint coordinators of the Rocket share offer, while BofA Merrill Lynch, Citigroup and UBS are joint bookrunners.(1 US dollar = 0.7729 euro) (Additional reporting by Mia Shanley in Stockholm and Kathrin Jones in Frankfurt; Editing by David Clarke)",2014-09-10,AMZN,"Wed Sep 10, 2014 | 8:30am EDT",Rocket's $6.5 billion float plan joins e-commerce listings rush,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-rocketinternet-ipo-idUSKBN0H50OY20140910?type=companyNews

386,"  (Corrects headline, first and second paragraphs to show group contacting Amazon board also includes authors not published by Hachette)By Deepa SeetharamanSAN FRANCISCO, Sept 15 More than 1,000 authors, including Malcolm Gladwell, Stephen King and James Patterson, have urged Amazon.com Inc's directors to end a contract dispute with Hachette Book Group that has cost some writers 90 percent of their sales on the online retailer's website.Authors United, a group representing authors, including many published by Hachette, called on Amazon's 10-person board to end what it called ""sanctions"" on Hachette book sales on Amazon's website during the dispute between the two companies over e-book prices.""We find it hard to believe that all members of the Amazon board approve of these actions,"" according to the letter posted online on Monday. ""We would like to ask you a question: Do you as an Amazon director approve of this policy of sanctioning books?"" (here)Amazon and Hachette, the fourth-largest U.S. book publisher owned by France's Lagardere, have been locked in a months-long dispute over the price of e-books. Amazon argues that most e-books should be sold at $9.99 to spur sales, while Hachette says it should be able to set prices on its own.Amazon has blocked pre-orders and slowed shipping times of some books, a negotiating tactic that has alienated a number of high-profile authors including Gladwell and Patterson. The dispute has driven down Hachette authors' sales on Amazon.com by at least half and in some cases as much as 90 percent, according to the letter. Sales of e-books as well as hardcover and paperback books have been hurt.""Because of Amazon's immense market share and its proprietary Kindle platform, other retailers have not made up the difference,"" according to the letter, which was first reported by the New York Times.Amazon was not immediately available for comment.

387,"   By Tom Bergin | LONDON  LONDON New international tax rules proposed on Tuesday could eliminate structures that have allowed companies such as Google Inc (GOOGL.O) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) to shave billions of dollars off their tax bills.The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) announced a series of measures that, if implemented by members, could stop companies from employing many commonly-used practices to shift profits into tax havens.Corporate tax avoidance has become a hot political topic following media coverage and parliamentary investigations into the arrangements many big companies use to cut tax bills.Amazon and Google say they pay all the taxes they should. Analysts say competitive pressures force companies to seek to minimize all costs, including tax.Last year, the Group of 20 leading economies asked the OECD to develop an action plan to tackle the problem.Big U.S. technology companies could be those most affected by the OECD's plans but others could also be hit, including pharmaceuticals and branded consumer goods firms, as well as many European companies.Chris Morgan, Head of Tax Policy at accountants KPMG in London, said the proposals were ""balanced"" and while some firms would pay more tax, big business accepted the need for change.Anti-poverty charity ActionAid criticized the plans saying some of the measures envisaged would be too expensive for developing countries to implement.The draft proposals announced have been agreed by all G20 members and OECD members, which include most major industrialized countries, the OECD said in a statement.But the measures form part of a larger ""(tax) base erosion and profit shifting"" program that will conclude next year. Only then will countries look at enshrining the results of the program in law.TREATY MISUSE  For more than 50 years, the OECD’s work on international taxation has been focused on ensuring companies are not taxed twice on the same profits. The fear was that this would hamper trade and limit global growth.Over the years, the OECD has formulated a standardized model tax treaty which allows countries to split taxation rights and avoid double taxation, partly by providing reliefs from measures intended to stop tax avoidance, such as withholding taxes.But companies have been using such treaties to ensure profits are not taxed anywhere.For example, search giant Google takes advantage of tax treaties to channel more than $8 billion in untaxed profits out of Europe and Asia each year and into a subsidiary that is tax resident in Bermuda, which has no income tax.Google Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt has said changes to rules that increase its tax bill would hit innovation.The OECD's proposals would make amendments to its model treaty so that cross-border transactions would not benefit from the reliefs in tax treaties, if a principal reason for engaging in the transactions was to avoid tax.""We are putting an end to double non-taxation,"" OECD head of tax Pascal Saint-Amans said in a call with reporters. The think tank, which also advises members on economic policy, also wants curbs on how much profit companies can report in centralized intra-company lending and purchasing arms, which are often based in tax havens.Where such subsidiaries generate large profits on the back of intra-company trade, the OECD said the profits should be shared across the group.This could hit UK telecoms provider Vodafone Group Plc (VOD.L), which has a Luxembourg subsidiary that buys telephone equipment for the group. Vodafone Procurement Company's 200 staff generated profits of more than 400 million euros ($518.5 million) last year, making it one of the group's smallest but most profitable divisions. An unusual Luxembourg tax rule allowed the subsidiary to pay no tax on that profit.Vodafone said businesses across Europe already benefited from savings achieved by the Luxembourg operation and that it did not expect a significant impact on its business from the OECD measures.     TAX RESIDENCE The OECD has also proposed changes in the rules on tax residence that allow U.S. tech giants to generate billions of dollars in sales in many countries but not have those revenues assessed for tax by those countries' tax authorities.A long-standing rule that allows a company to operate a warehouse in a country without creating a tax residence there should be reconsidered, the OECD said.This would potentially hit Internet retailer Amazon as the warehouse exclusion allowed Amazon to channel 15 billion euros last year in European sales to a subsidiary in Luxembourg, where it can build up profits tax free.A raft of companies which sell online including Apple Inc's iTunes service, software provider Adobe Systems Inc. (ADBE.O) and e-commerce group eBay Inc. (EBAY.O) could also be forced to report revenues in the countries where they are generated, if the OECD's proposal that having a ""significant digital presence"" in a country would also create a tax residence.A Reuters investigation last year found that three quarters of the 50 biggest U.S. technology companies channeled revenues from European sales into low tax jurisdictions such as Ireland and Switzerland, rather than reporting them nationally.The companies all say they comply with tax rules in all the countries where they operate.     Anton Hume, Global Head of Transfer Pricing at accountants BDO, said the measures could prompt companies to change their structures and move jobs out of tax havens: ""It may mean that a lot of activities are onshored again.""However, Ireland's jobs and enterprise minister, Richard Bruton, said his country would not lose out.""As countries move away from other tax haven situations, a good country with a very clear, certain, regime like Ireland can stand to gain,"" he said.

390,"  WASHINGTON, Sept 15 A joint venture of Boeing Co  and Lockheed Martin Corp plans to announce on Wednesday that it will team up with Blue Origin, a company run by Amazon.com Inc founder Jeff Bezos, to develop a new rocket engine, a source familiar with the plans said.Officials at Boeing and Lockheed declined comment. No comment was immediately available from Blue Origin or United Launch Alliance (ULA), the Boeing-Lockheed venture that uses Russian-built engines to power some of its rockets.ULA had sent out a request for information asking the U.S. aerospace industry earlier this year for ideas on how to replace the Russian-built RD-180 that powers ULA's heavy-lift Atlas 5 rockets, which are used to launch many U.S. military and spy satellites.Tensions with Russia over its actions in Ukraine have raised concerns that Russia could cut off deliveries of the RD-180 engines, according to U.S. officials, who hope to start funding work on a U.S. alternative in the Pentagon's 2016 budget.The partnership agreement will pit Bezos against Elon Musk, founder and chief executive of Space Exploration Technologies Corp, or SpaceX, which is seeking certification from the Air Force for its own Falcon 9 rockets. The certification was due to be completed by the end of this year, but may now slip into next year, according to U.S. officials. They said the process may be slowed while officials look into the recent explosion of a SpaceX experimental rocket that uses the same engine as the Falcon 9.SpaceX is also competing with Boeing and privately held Sierra Nevada Corp. for a NASA contract to ferry astronauts to and from the international space station.NASA is expected to award that contract to one or more bidders on Tuesday, according to two sources familiar with the process. Boeing is poised to win the lion's share of that work, according to the Wall Street Journal, which also reported the expected ULA teaming agreement with Bezos.Boeing would benefit from development of a new U.S. alternate rocket engine, since its commercial crew capsule would also be launched by the Atlas 5 rocket, industry officials said. Pentagon acquisition chief Frank Kendall this month said U.S. officials were looking at a joint government-industry development of a U.S. rocket engine and other options to reduce U.S. reliance on Russian-built engines.Despite the concerns, Russia has continued to deliver RD-180 engines to the United States, with two engines arriving last month and three more slated for delivery this fall.ULA says it has enough RD-180 engines on hand to last for two years. It has an $11 billion contract with the U.S. Air Force for 36 launches, but SpaceX, has sued in federal claims court to be allowed to compete for more of that work.(Reporting by Andrea Shalal; Editing by Matt Driskill)",2014-09-16,AMZN,"Mon Sep 15, 2014 | 11:47pm EDT",Boeing-Lockheed venture said teaming with Bezos on rocket engine,http://www.reuters.com//article/boeing-lockheed-martin-bezos-idUSL1N0RH06Y20140916?type=companyNews
391,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON United Launch Alliance (ULA), a Boeing Co and Lockheed Martin Corp joint venture, said on Wednesday it would invest heavily in a new rocket engine being developed by Amazon.com Inc founder Jeff Bezos and his company Blue Origin.The new engine, called the BE-4, could be ready for use in four years, and would cost substantially less than the Russian-built RD-180 engine now used to power ULA's heavy-lift Atlas 5 rockets, officials from both companies told reporters.The U.S. government is grappling with how to reduce its reliance on the Russian-built engines, a matter of growing concern this year after Russia' actions in Ukraine. The announcement showed mounting pressure on ULA, the sole rocket launch provider for most U.S. military and spy satellites, to lower costs as it faces growing competition from another entrepreneur, Elon Musk, and his firm Space Exploration Technologies.SpaceX is seeking Air Force certification of its Falcon 9 rocket, and plans to release its own heavy-lift rocket to compete with ULA's Atlas 5 next year.""It's really time for our country to move toward an all-American launch vehicle, and I can't think of a better way to get on that path,"" said Tory Bruno, chief executive of ULA.Bruno told reporters ULA had a two-year supply of Russian engines, with 11 more to be delivered later this year and next. He said he did not expect problems with those deliveries, despite the company's decision to develop a U.S. alternative. Bezos, a well-known technology entrepreneur, said he was excited to work on the project with ULA, which just carried out its 88th consecutive, successful launch. He said the engine could pave the way toward a future in which ""millions of people"" lived and worked in space.Pentagon acquisition chief Frank Kendall said he had not been fully briefed on the initiative, but called it an example of the innovative and creative ideas the military was seeking on how to end dependence on Russian-built engines.General John Hyten, head of Air Force Space Command, welcomed news that the effort was privately funded, but stressed that any new engine would have to pass a rigorous certification process, like the one SpaceX is undergoing, before it could be used to launch expensive and critical satellites into space. ""I’m not sure which way we're (ultimately) going to go,"" he said. ""But...the more competition and the more ideas we have, the better off we are.""Musk told Fox Business Network he viewed the ULA-Bezos  agreement as a compliment. ""If all your competitors are banding together to attack you, that's like a good compliment.""Bezos said ULA was making a significant investment in the development of the BE-4 engine, which would help accelerate the program, but gave no details. Bezos said only that it was possible to develop an engine for less than the standard estimate of seven years and $1 billion.     He said his company had been working for three years on the new liquid oxygen engine, which will deliver 550,000 pounds of thrust at sea level, and testing of various components was already under way at the company's new facility in West Texas.Bezos said the engine could eventually be reusable, although ULA did not plan to recover them initially. Blue Origin was continuing to work on plans for its own orbital vehicle, which would re-use the engines and should be ready later this decade.ULA said it would use two BE-4 engines on each of its boosters, providing combined thrust of over 1 million pounds, more than the RD-180 engine now used on the Atlas 5 rocket.The engine will use liquefied natural gas.Bezos said Blue Origin was also part of the Boeing team that won a $4.2 billion contract from NASA on Tuesday to develop a space taxi. Boeing said its bid uses the Atlas 5 rocket and RD-180 engines, but leaves open the possibility of switching to a different engine or booster.

394,"   By Brian Winter | SAO PAULO  SAO PAULO In an emotional new television ad, Brazilian presidential candidate Marina Silva hit back at rumors that she would do away with popular social welfare programs if elected, citing her own youth growing up poor and hungry in the Amazon rainforest.The ad, which ran late Tuesday, went viral on social media and could swing some momentum back in Silva's favor after recent polls showed her support sagging as she battles to unseat leftist President Dilma Rousseff in Brazil's Oct. 5 election.Silva, an environmentalist running on a pro-market platform, lashed out at what she described as Rousseff's recent negative campaigning and denied that she would halt the popular decade-old ""Bolsa Familia"" program, which pays a monthly stipend to poor families.""I know what it's like to be hungry,"" Silva said. ""All my mother had (to feed) eight children was an egg and a little bit of flour and salt.""Choking back tears, Silva recalled how her parents often went more than a day without eating but disguised their hunger so as not to worry their children. ""Whoever lived through that experience will never do away with 'Bolsa Familia',"" Silva thundered. ""That's not rhetoric. That's my life.""The ad was mentioned on the front page of some newspapers on Wednesday and appeared to strike a nerve in a country where more than half of households earn less than $1,000 a month. Despite her own humble roots, which also saw her work as a maid and learn to read as a teenager, Silva has struggled to win over poorer voters. They tend to prefer Rousseff and her Workers' Party for their record of reducing poverty and expanding social programs over the past decade. Silva and Rousseff are likely to face each other in a runoff on Oct. 26. Earlier this month, Silva had a slight lead in such a scenario, but she recently slipped back into a statistical tie with Rousseff after ads highlighted Silva's connections with bankers and relative lack of political party support.The latest poll by Datafolha showed Rousseff leading Silva in a runoff by a 51 percent to 39 percent margin among voters making less than about $700 a month. Silva had a strong lead among all other income groups. Silva's new ad, filmed during a recent campaign appearance in Brazil's impoverished northeast, is the most explicit to date about her destitute background and also received praise for being comparable to Rousseff's high-quality ads. ""Strongest sign so far that (Silva) now has a marketing team that can execute and has funding,"" one Twitter user wrote.One executive based in Sao Paulo wrote via email: ""Heard about it on the radio this morning, but had no idea of how powerful it was.

395,"   By Brian Winter | SAO PAULO, Sept 17  SAO PAULO, Sept 17 In an emotional new television ad, Brazilian presidential candidate Marina Silva hit back at rumors that she would do away with popular social welfare programs if elected, citing her own youth growing up poor and hungry in the Amazon rainforest.The ad, which ran late Tuesday, went viral on social media and could swing some momentum back in Silva's favor after recent polls showed her support sagging as she battles to unseat leftist President Dilma Rousseff in Brazil's Oct. 5 election.Silva, an environmentalist running on a pro-market platform, lashed out at what she described as Rousseff's recent negative campaigning and denied that she would halt the popular decade-old ""Bolsa Familia"" program, which pays a monthly stipend to poor families.""I know what it's like to be hungry,"" Silva said. ""All my mother had (to feed) eight children was an egg and a little bit of flour and salt."" Choking back tears, Silva recalled how her parents often went more than a day without eating but disguised their hunger so as not to worry their children.""Whoever lived through that experience will never do away with 'Bolsa Familia',"" Silva thundered. ""That's not rhetoric. That's my life."" The ad was mentioned on the front page of some newspapers on Wednesday and appeared to strike a nerve in a country where more than half of households earn less than $1,000 a month.Despite her own humble roots, which also saw her work as a maid and learn to read as a teenager, Silva has struggled to win over poorer voters. They tend to prefer Rousseff and her Workers' Party for their record of reducing poverty and expanding social programs over the past decade.Silva and Rousseff are likely to face each other in a runoff on Oct. 26. Earlier this month, Silva had a slight lead in such a scenario, but she recently slipped back into a statistical tie with Rousseff after ads highlighted Silva's connections with bankers and relative lack of political party support. The latest poll by Datafolha showed Rousseff leading Silva in a runoff by a 51 percent to 39 percent margin among voters making less than about $700 a month. Silva had a strong lead among all other income groups.Silva's new ad, filmed during a recent campaign appearance in Brazil's impoverished northeast, is the most explicit to date about her destitute background and also received praise for being comparable to Rousseff's high-quality ads.""Strongest sign so far that (Silva) now has a marketing team that can execute and has funding,"" one Twitter user wrote.One executive based in Sao Paulo wrote via email: ""Heard about it on the radio this morning, but had no idea of how powerful it was. I'm crying here in the office.""

396,"   By Emma Thomasson | INGOLSTADT Germany  INGOLSTADT Germany Europe's top electronics retailer Media-Saturn unveiled a new store with access to more products via a giant video wall and a drive-in collection point for online orders, aiming to better link online and offline shopping and fight back against internet specialists.Media-Saturn, whose sprawling stores selling everything from washing machines to laptops generate about a third of the revenues of retail group Metro, has seen online competition from the likes of Amazon steadily erode its business in recent years.A dispute between majority owner Metro and Media-Saturn founder, Erich Kellerhals, delayed the company's move online until 2010 and it is now playing catch-up, trying to integrate its e-commerce business with its stores.""Big stores and low prices ...are no longer a guarantee of success,"" Wolfgang Kirsch, head of Media-Saturn in its home market Germany, told a news conference on Thursday.""Our new store is driven by the central principle of finding new ways to combine the online and offline world in a new shopping experience which really inspires the demanding customers of today."" The new Media Markt store due to open next week in the southern German town of Ingolstadt is part of a broader trend among traditional retailers to use technology to make better use of costly store space to present a bigger range of goods.British clothing retailer Marks & Spencer has developed a ""virtual rail"" that allows shoppers in a small Amsterdam store to browse its full catalogue on large screens, while German sportswear firm Adidas uses digital ""shoe walls"" to present all its styles and colors. The new Media Markt store features a huge video wall where customers can navigate through all 60,000 products on offer online - compared to the 45,000 available in the store - as well as a drive-in facility behind the store where shoppers can collect orders made online or by telephone. It will offer shoppers free Wi-Fi and charging stations for smartphones as well as digital navigation of the store.Store staff will also demonstrate how gadgets can be used together, for example how smartphones can work with baby monitors. REASON TO VISIT STORE Electronics firm Samsung has also recently launched a life-size, touch-screen interface that allows customers to check out its full range of fridges, washing machines and dishwashers.""Retailers will see multiple benefits,"" said Simon Hathaway from Samsung marketing agency Cheil which developed the system. ""It allows them to show a full range in relatively small space and creates a genuine reason to visit a store, something that many struggle to deliver."" Media-Saturn, the world's second-biggest consumer electronics chain after Best Buy with more than 950 Media Markt and Saturn stores in 17 countries, saw sales fall 1.3 percent to 16 billion euros ($20.6 billion) in the nine months to end June.Online sales still only account for about 7 percent of sales, but Kirsch said about 70 percent of customers already check out products online before buying in the store, while almost half order online and pick up in store.Its main store rivals in Europe are Dixons Retail and Darty Plc, but it also faces fierce competition from Amazon. British online domestic appliances retailer AO World is also planning to launch in Germany soon.As it responds to that threat, Media-Saturn launched a new service earlier this year to offer express home delivery of smaller items like smartphones and laptops within 30 minutes, which it plans to extend to large items in future.(1 US dollar = 0.7762 euro) (Editing by Elaine Hardcastle)",2014-09-18,AMZN,"Thu Sep 18, 2014 | 8:36am EDT",Virtual meets real in Media-Saturn's new store,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-metro-ag-mediasaturn-idUSKBN0HD1FT20140918?type=companyNews

The No. 1 U.S. online retailer also revamped its basic Kindle e-reader to include a touch screen. It will cost $79, about 15 percent more than the current basic model.Other new devices unveiled on Wednesday are a $99 Kindle Fire HD tablet, which includes a smaller, six-inch screen as well as a tablet designed for kids that starts at $149. Amazon also upgraded its 7-inch and 8.9 inch Fire tablets.All the upgraded and new devices start shipping in October.  The expanding Kindle lineup underscores Chief Executive Jeff Bezos' commitment to developing devices as a way to retain users and bolster its core business of retail and shopping.This year alone, Amazon has launched a set-top box, a grocery ordering wand and a Fire smart phone, which debuted in July to lackluster reviews.Amazon, which entered the hardware sector with the 2007 launch of the Kindle, has adopted a strategy of selling the devices at cost, and it profits when users buy content or goods. It has been investing heavily in content, inking a deal this year to stream some HBO shows including ""The Sopranos"" and ""The Wire"" to members of its Prime subscription program.

399,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The U.S. drive to end its reliance on Russian rocket motors got a boost this week when Amazon.com Inc founder Jeff Bezos unveiled a new engine project, but officials and industry insiders say it will take years and hundreds of millions of dollars to develop a locally built alternative.Other companies, including privately held Space Exploration Technologies, led by another technology billionaire, Elon Musk, and Aerojet Rocketdyne, a unit of GenCorp Inc, have been energized by the Pentagon's growing determination to find alternatives to the Russian-built RD-180 engine now used to launch some of the biggest U.S. military and spy satellites.Companies were due to submit by Friday formal requests for information (RFI) from the U.S. Air Force. The Air Force is also hosting meetings on the issue with the industry at Los Angeles Air Force Base next week.Until now, U.S. production of the RD-180 or development of a separate engine were seen as too costly, and a possible irritant to relations with Moscow at a time when Washington depended on Russia to ferry U.S. astronauts to the International Space Station.Those views changed after Russia annexed Crimea. U.S. officials are now more concerned that rising tensions could prompt Moscow to halt deliveries of the engines needed to launch the most sensitive U.S. spy satellites.Lawmakers wrote to President Barack Obama this week, citing widespread support for efforts to develop a U.S. engine, and to ensure it would be available to multiple launch companies. Air Force Secretary Deborah James told reporters the U.S. government was determined to end its reliance on the Russian engines ""as soon as practicable."" Air Force officials would review industry responses to the RFI before deciding on the next steps, she added, but initial funding was likely to be included in the fiscal 2016 budget request submitted to Congress next February. One former senior U.S. official cautioned the engine developed by Bezos' Blue Origin in conjunction with the United Launch Alliance - a joint venture of Boeing Co and Lockheed Martin - faced ""a large number of technical challenges."" The design calls for unconventional propellants such as liquid oxygen and liquefied natural gas. Tory Bruno, chief executive of ULA, told reporters this week  it would take about four more years before the Blue Origin engine was ready. He acknowledged the current Atlas 5 booster would need modification given the different fuel used by the BE-4 engine. He said ULA was confident about the project, but had ""contingency plans"" to fall back on.Russia's Energomash was also continuing to deliver RD-180 engines, with no threat to that supply for now, Bruno added. Bezos underscored the complexity of developing a new rocket engine, telling reporters: ""There is no way to rush the rocket development process. You can't cut corners. It needs to be methodical and deliberate."" Aerojet Rocketdyne has been doing preliminary research with Dynetics Inc, a private research group, on a new engine. Steve Cook, Dynetics' director of corporate development, said he was confident a prototype could be developed in 2-1/2 years, and a new engine could be ready by 2019.SpaceX plans to unveil its own heavy-lift rocket next year, which could replace or augment ULA's Atlas 5 rocket.

405,"   By Deepa Seetharaman and Noel Randewich | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Amazon.com Inc will boost staffing at its secretive Silicon Valley-based hardware unit by at least 27 percent over the next five years as it tests Internet-connected ""smart"" home gadgets such as a one-button device to order supplies.The plans, detailed in a little-known government document and by people familiar with the matter, signal Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos's intentions to double down on the No. 1 U.S. online retailer's hardware strategy. This is despite the lukewarm reception of Amazon's new Fire smart phone and some investors' criticism of its heavy spending on highly experimental projects.The Lab126 division, which developed Amazon's Kindle and other consumer electronics devices, plans to boost its full-time payroll to at least 3,757 people by 2019, according to the agreement reached with California in June that would give Amazon $1.2 million in tax breaks.Amazon will invest $55 million in Lab126's operations in Sunnyvale and Cupertino, the agreement posted on the California governor's website shows.This expansion comes as Lab126 tests connected-home devices that could open up a new front in its war against Google Inc and Apple Inc, two people familiar with Lab126's activities said recently.The sources requested anonymity because they are not authorized to speak to the media.Technology companies see Internet-connected dishwashers, thermostats and other household devices that can ""talk"" to one another as ways to fuel demand for products and services. But skeptics say many of these devices cost too much for most consumers and could take years to go mainstream.Amazon is testing a simple wi-fi device that could be placed in the kitchen or a closet, allowing customers to order products like detergent by pressing a button, one of the people said. Lab126 is also interested in wearable devices, the other person said. Both sources stressed that such devices may never come to market. These details shed rare light on the division at Amazon, which is notoriously tight-lipped about any unit's operations and staffing.In a statement, Amazon said Lab126 was moving ""incredibly quickly"" and cited the company's 2014 devices, including the Fire phone, Fire set-top box and several new tablets and e-readers.""We will continue to invent and create new features, services and products, and to support this innovation. Lab 126 is also growing very quickly,"" Amazon spokeswoman Kinley Pearsall said. AIM TO BE INDISPENSABLE Whether or not Amazon ultimately sells connected home and wearable devices, the experiments hint at Bezos' broader ambitions. Lab126 has become increasingly important to Amazon's broader aim to use devices to make it indispensable to its more than 240 million active users.Bezos is deeply involved in developing Lab126's projects, from the 2007 debut of the first Kindle e-reader to the Fire phone.The Fire phone, which Lab126 worked on for four years, debuted this summer to lackluster sales and reviews. Earlier this month, Amazon cut the price of its phone to 99 cents with a two-year contract with AT&T.  Amazon shares are down nearly 20 percent this year.Other tech leaders are also seeking a central place in the home. In January, Google bought Nest Labs, a smart thermostat maker for $3.2 billion. In June, Apple announced plans for HomeKit, its own framework for connecting household gadgets.Embedding households with such devices would be much more lucrative than merely selling gadgets like wireless LED light bulbs or wi-fi garage-door openers.With Lab126's experiments, Amazon envisions homes decked out with Internet-connected sensors that would allow it to tell customers ahead of time when they need to replace air conditioner filters or service their washing machines, one of the sources said.""If I walk into my laundry room and there's a big pool of water and the floor needs to be replaced, I'd love to know about it two weeks before it happens,"" said Ryo Koyama, CEO of Weaved, a startup working on connected-home technology.Lab126 had almost 3,000 full-time employees in its 2013 taxable year.

409,"  (Adds bulletins from Amazon and Google in seventh paragraph)By Jim FinkleBOSTON, Sept 25 Hackers have begun exploiting the newly identified ""Shellshock"" computer bug, using fast-moving worm viruses to scan for vulnerable systems and then infect them, researchers warned on Thursday.""Shellshock"" is the first major Internet threat to emerge since the discovery in April of ""Heartbleed,"" which affected encryption software used in about two-thirds of all web servers, along with hundreds of technology products.The latest bug has been compared to ""Heartbleed"" partly because the software at the heart of the ""Shellshock"" bug, known as Bash, is also widely used in web servers and other types of computer equipment.According to security experts, ""Shellshock"" is unlikely to affect as many systems as ""Heartbleed"" because not all computers running Bash can be exploited. Still, they said the new bug has the potential to wreak more havoc because it enables hackers to gain complete control of an infected machine, which lets them destroy data, shut down networks or launch attacks on websites.The ""Heartbleed"" bug only allowed hackers to steal data.The industry is rushing to determine which systems can be remotely compromised by hackers, but there are currently no estimates on the number of vulnerable systems.Amazon.com Inc and Google Inc have released bulletins to advise web services customers how to protect themselves from the new cyber threat. A Google spokesman said the company is releasing software patches to fix the bug.""We don't actually know how widespread this is. This is probably one of the most difficult-to-measure bugs that has come along in years,"" said Dan Kaminsky, a well-known expert on Internet threats. For an attack to be successful, a targeted system must be accessible via the Internet and also running a second vulnerable set of code besides Bash, experts said.""There is a lot of speculation out there as to what is vulnerable, but we just don't have the answers,"" said Marc Maiffret, chief technology officer of cybersecurity firm BeyondTrust. ""This is going to unfold over the coming weeks and months.""ATTACKS ON DEVICES Joe Hancock, a cybersecurity expert with insurer AEGIS in London, said in a statement that he is concerned about the potential for attacks on home broadband routers and controllers used to manage critical infrastructure facilities. ""In some areas this will be a challenge to fix, as many embedded devices are not designed with regular updates in mind and will never be able to be patched,"" Hancock said.HD Moore, chief research officer with security software maker Rapid7, said it could take weeks or even months to determine what impact the bug will have.""At this point we don't know what we don't know, but we do expect to see additional exploit vectors surface as vendors and researchers start the assessment process for their products and services,"" Moore said in an email. ""We are likely to see compromises as a result of this issue for years to come.""Linux makers released patches to protect against attacks on Wednesday, though security researchers uncovered flaws in those updates, prompting No. 1 Linux maker Red Hat Inc to advise customers that the patch was ""incomplete."" ""That's a problem. It's been a little over 24 hours and we're still in the same boat,"" said Mat Gangwer, lead security consultant at Rook Security. ""People are kind of freaking out. Rightfully so.""WORMS Russian security software maker Kaspersky Lab reported that a computer worm has begun infecting computers by exploiting ""Shellshock.""The malicious software can take control of an infected machine, launch denial-of-service attacks to disrupt websites, and also scan for other vulnerable devices, including routers, said Kaspersky researcher David Jacoby.He said he did not know who was behind the attacks and could not name any victims.Jaime Blasco, labs director at AlienVault, said he had uncovered the same piece of malware, as well as a second worm seeking to exploit ""Shellshock,"" which was designed for launching denial of service attacks.""Heartbleed"" is a bug in an open-source encryption software called OpenSSL. The bug put the data of millions of people at risk, as OpenSSL is used in about two-thirds of all websites. It also forced dozens of technology companies to issue security patches for hundreds of products that use OpenSSL.(Additional reporting by Carolyn Cohn and Devika Krishna Kumar in Bangalore; Editing by Dan Grebler)",2014-09-26,AMZN,"Thu Sep 25, 2014 | 8:20pm EDT",UPDATE 3-Hackers exploit 'Shellshock' bug with worms in early attacks,http://www.reuters.com//article/cybersecurity-shellshock-idUSL2N0RQ21P20140926?type=companyNews
410,"  LIMA A Spanish speleologist trapped 400 meters (1,312 feet) underground in a cave in the Peruvian Amazon for nearly two weeks was pulled to safety on Tuesday, a rescue worker said.Cecilio Lopez-Tercero was stuck in the cave, named Intimachay, for 12 days in Peru's northern Amazonas region, where the temperature can drop as low as 10 degrees Celsius and humidity reaches 100 percent.After being lifted from the cave with a pulley, Lopez-Tercero said that he hopes to get well enough soon to continue exploring the area, rescue worker Javier Farje told Reuters. More than 100 rescue workers, including several Spanish colleagues who traveled to South America to help in the effort, broke into applause and embraced each other after Lopez-Tercero appeared at the surface, according to local broadcaster RPP.Lopez-Tercero suffered a back injury when he fell in the cave, according to local media. After being pulled from the cave, he was moved to a makeshift camp for initial medical care, Farje said, and would be taken via helicopter to Lima.

411,"   By Alexei Oreskovic | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Google Inc is planning new and revamped streaming-music services in coming weeks, searching for a way to stand out in an increasingly crowded field of rivals from Apple Inc and Amazon.com Inc to Spotify. Nailing music is one way for Google to raise chances of continued success as people spend more time on mobile devices.Google's YouTube service has become a low-profile titan in streaming through the popularity of music videos. Currently, videos must be chosen one track at a time. YouTube in coming weeks will launch new subscription and ad-supported YouTube music services able to play several tracks in a row, a person familiar with the plans said.Google had been expected to launch the YouTube services by the end of summer and had offered few details.Also coming soon: an update of Google's existing $10-a-month All Access subscription-music streaming service. The new version will incorporate technology acquired by Google with the purchase of Songza, a service known for its ability to recommend music, Jamie Rosenberg, Google's Vice President of Digital Content, said in an interview.The variety of approaches risks confusing consumers, said Alex Luke, a venture capitalist at The Valley Fund, who has worked as an executive at music label EMI Music and was the director of music programming at Apple until 2011.He argued that the winners in digital music would offer radio-style programs, downloads and let listeners put together their own playlists. (For a graphic of music sales see: link.reuters.com/fap92w) “The marketplace hasn’t found itself yet and you’re going to continue to see the big players like Apple and Google experiment,” Luke said. ""The thing that Google and YouTube both have in their favor is these huge, active user bases."" The latest music push comes 16 months after Google launched its All Access subscription service. Industry observers say All Access has struggled to stand out and set Google into a markedly different business than the free, ad-supported services that have long underpinned its success. Google’s All Access subscription music service likely draws between 500,000 and a few million users, said Mark Mulligan of research and consulting firm Midia Research. That puts it in the same ranks as rivals Rhapsody and Deezer, but behind Spotify, which has more than 10 million paying subscribers.Apple has a Beats subscription streaming service, acquired with the Beats headphone line in May, and it has free iTunes radio, which analysts say has not been a breakout success. E-commerce giant Amazon launched its music service in June, providing streaming of a limited catalog of music to members of its $99-a-year Prime service.  The U.S. music market is worth $7 billion but royalty and marketing expenditures mean most streaming music businesses currently lose money, according to estimates from Brian Zisk, executive producer of the SF MusicTech Summit.  Mulligan described Google's music service in a ""holding pattern"", arguing that Google should be at least as big as Spotify given Google's resources and existing user base. Google’s Rosenberg acknowledged the service is not the market leader, but said Google was encouraged by what he called a ""very healthy"" portion of consumers who subscribed after a free one-month trial. He saw no need to cut the $10 monthly subscription price. “Is the bigger upside getting more people to try these services, or is the bigger upside dropping the price by a dollar or two?"" he asked. ""Right now we’re focused on creating broad awareness that the service exists."" All Access is now available in 43 countries, he said.To stand out, Google envisions a service ""that extends seamlessly to your wearable device or to your car,"" and that's intelligent enough to play ""the right music for the right moment,"" Rosenberg says. Marc Ruxin, the Chief Operating Officer of Rdio, a competing, privately-held streaming service, said Google wanted to use music to keep its main service, search, top of mind.“Google like any Internet company is in a war for attention, so they want as much user time on a daily basis that they can get,” he said.

413,"  (Repeats for wider distribution; no changes to text)By Anjali AthavaleyNEW YORK Oct 1 PepsiCo Inc for the first time is introducing a product exclusively through Amazon.com Inc as the snack and soft drink maker aims to expand its footprint in e-commerce.The product, a naturally sweetened soda called Pepsi True, will be available on Amazon in mid-October in 24-packs of 7.5-ounce cans, the company said. It will not be in brick-and-mortar outlets, though Pepsi said it plans to eventually sell True in grocery stores.By introducing True through Amazon, Pepsi says it can better assess demand and gain insight into where people are buying it ahead of a wider launch.Industry insiders said the move illustrates how the food and beverage industry is expanding into non-traditional distribution channels like e-commerce as it searches for growth.Kraft Foods Group Inc recently started selling Jell-O molds of university mascots and logos through Amazon and grocery stores. And other companies are using Amazon to test the waters when reintroducing a product. Coca-Cola Co said recently it would bring back Surge, a soda it discontinued 12 years ago, through Amazon.""While it seems there is still demand for the product, we aren't sure how much or how quickly it will sell,"" a Coca-Cola spokesman said in an email. ""Working with Amazon allows us to determine what the market for Surge really is."" Amazon says the consumer goods space is one of its fastest-growing categories. Last spring it introduced Prime Pantry, where its Prime members can shop for hundreds of household items including soft drinks, laundry detergent and cereal.At Pepsi, ""online selling is a relatively new endeavor,"" said Simon Lowden, chief marketing officer at Pepsi Beverages North America. ""You should expect online commerce to be a much bigger part of our proposition going forward.""The e-commerce space comes with risks as well as opportunities. Amazon could put downward pressure on prices in the consumer packaged goods category, as it did with e-books, analysts at Sanford Bernstein said in a research note in April. And Amazon's vast array of products could make it harder for brands to stand out. A Pepsi spokeswoman said prices for its other products sold on Amazon have been stable. The company says it decided to introduce True through Amazon after noting the success of other products such as its Starbucks Double Shot Light, Pepsi's top-selling item year-to-date in e-commerce. Pepsi sells the product through a joint venture with Starbucks Corp.Still, e-commerce is especially tricky for soda companies because of their agreements with bottling partners, which have exclusive distribution rights in certain regions. Lowden said that although Pepsi True will not be distributed through Pepsi's bottler system, bottlers will be compensated for revenue they would have received when purchases are made through Amazon in their territories.SOFTER SALES  Pepsi's move comes against the backdrop of nearly a decade of declining sales of carbonated soft drinks in the United States, according to the trade publication Beverage Digest, as consumers have become more health-conscious. More recently, consumers have also shifted away from diet soda because of health concerns about artificial sweeteners.Pepsi True is a ""mid-calorie"" offering sweetened by sugar and stevia, a plant-based sweetener. It is aimed at people who want a naturally sweetened cola with fewer calories. A 7.5-ounce can of True contains 60 calories. That compares with 100 calories for the same-size can of regular Pepsi.Stevia doesn't appeal to all palates, and soft drink makers have been trying to eliminate its bitter aftertaste. Pepsi said it spent three years developing True, drawing from its knowledge of stevia-sweetened colas in overseas markets and tweaking the formula for the U.S. consumer.It is not the first company to launch soft drinks containing the sweetener in a measured way. Coke recently launched Coca-Cola Life, a sugar- and stevia-sweetened soda, in Fresh Market, a premium grocery chain, in four states.

That disadvantage, which contrasts with U.S. President Barack Obama's overwhelming support from African-Americans in the 2008 and 2012 elections, could cost Silva victory in this extremely close election.The reasons behind Silva's struggles speak volumes about Brazil's history, its complex relationship with race, and the recent social progress that has made Rousseff a slight favorite to win a second term despite a stagnant economy.In recent weeks, Reuters interviewed two dozen Brazilians of color in three different cities. Many said they would be proud to see Silva win – especially in a country where people of color have historically been underrepresented in government, universities and elsewhere.Yet they also said they were more focused on the economy than any other factor. Since taking power in 2003, Rousseff’s leftist Workers’ Party has made enormous strides in reducing poverty – especially among blacks.""No one wants to go back to the past,"" said Gustavo Leira, 71, a retired public servant in Brasilia. Silva’s race is important, he said, “but it’s not the most important thing.”Silva, who is running on a more centrist, market-friendly platform, has mostly avoided the subject of race, reflecting a long tradition in Brazilian politics and society. Brazilians overwhelmingly shy away from speaking about race, preferring to speak in terms of class instead. Over the centuries, more than 10 times as many African slaves were brought to Brazil than to the United States. Brazil was the last country in the Americas to abolish the practice, in 1888. Today, blacks are more than three times as likely as whites to suffer from extreme poverty.Asked in an interview with Reuters last week what it would mean to be Brazil's first black president, Silva replied: ""Not just (that) ... I'd also be the first environmentalist.""“I’m very proud of my identity as a black woman,” she continued. “But I don’t make political use of my faith, or my color. I’m going to govern for blacks, whites, (Asians), believers, non-believers, independent of their color or social conditions.""     ""BIGGEST MYSTERY"" Silva's stance is consistent with her especially inclusive brand of politics, which has brought together evangelical Christians, web-savvy urban youths, banking tycoons, and others.But it has also mystified some political analysts and voters who say that, by not playing up her roots more, she is missing a golden opportunity to better connect with a huge demographic group that is mostly supporting her opponent.A senior adviser to Rousseff called Silva's reluctance to discuss her race ""the biggest mystery of this campaign.""  Some, especially the young, are urging Silva to be more vocal about her background. They say that a dramatic rise in the enrollment of blacks at universities, thanks in part to new racial quotas, has fueled a growing racial consciousness. Other prominent black leaders have also emerged, including former Supreme Court Chief Justice Joaquim Barbosa, who has urged Brazilians to speak more honestly about racial issues.But change has been slow. Indeed, although most Brazilian pollsters ask respondents about their race and break down results accordingly, Rousseff's lead among blacks has barely been commented upon in local media.Regina Collson, a 23-year-old university student, said she has tried to convince classmates to vote for Silva by emphasizing how her African background, and her impoverished youth, would mark a ""big change"" from politics as usual.""She would bring a different perspective,"" Collson said. ""But people aren't talking about it (that way). It makes me mad.""         ""POVERTY IN BRAZIL HAS A FACE"" Whatever tactical changes Silva makes from here on out could swing what is a very close election. The first round of voting is on Sunday. Polls indicate that neither Rousseff nor Silva is likely to win a majority of votes.That means the two would face each other in a runoff on Oct. 26. Rousseff has built momentum recently, and polls have shown her ahead of Silva by about 4 percentage points in a second round. In polls over the last two weeks, Rousseff has enjoyed a solid advantage over Silva of between 6 and 7 percentage points among voters who identify themselves as black or ""pardo"" - a Portuguese term for people of mixed race. Together, they make up a little more than half of Brazil's population.Among whites, who account for about 40 percent of the electorate, the campaign has been more volatile. Silva enjoyed as much as an 8-percentage point advantage over Rousseff among whites in one poll and was statistically tied with her in another.Asians, indigenous people and other groups make up the rest of voters.In numerous TV ads, Rousseff has warned that voting for Silva could endanger the social gains of the last decade. Her party has also portrayed Silva’s advocacy of tighter fiscal policies and her friendship with Neca Setubal, a member of a prominent family of bankers, as a sign that she would govern on behalf of the rich.Silva has denied that, pointing to her own socialist background and the fact she was herself a member of the Workers' Party until 2009.Meanwhile, Rousseff's government has not shied away from describing its own achievements in racial terms.""Poverty in Brazil has a face, and that face is black,"" Tereza Campello, Brazil's minister for social development and combating hunger, said in an interview.She pointed to data showing that some 22 million people have been lifted out of extreme poverty over the past decade thanks to robust economic growth and social welfare programs. Among them, 78 percent were blacks or pardos.""We have invested in this like no one else,"" Campello said. ""So people say: 'My life has improved. Am I going to vote for the other candidate? Just because she's black?'"" Such questions have led some Brazilians to compare Silva's candidacy with Obama's historic campaign.  In 2008, Obama won 95 percent of the African-American vote. That advantage, plus his support from two-thirds of Hispanic voters, helped him overcome a 12 percentage point deficit among white voters. The margins were broadly similar when Obama won re-election in 2012.While Obama did not make race a theme of his campaigns, he did address it at key moments - including a famous speech in March 2008 in which he discussed the anger felt by many in the black community, and what it was like to be the son of a white mother from Kansas and a black father from Kenya.Silva also comes from a mixed racial background - just like many, if not most, Brazilians.  Ever since the Portuguese began bringing African slaves here in the 16th century to harvest cash crops like sugar cane, races have intermingled far more than they did in the United States - meaning the line between white and black is often blurred and, in the minds of some Brazilians, nonexistent.In fact, several voters said that Silva's own background would make it hard for her to emphasize her black identity in the campaign. They highlighted Silva's indigenous blood and her birth in the Amazon - far from the Afro-Brazilian heartland in the northeast.""I see her as more Indian than black,"" said Lisa Moraes, 43, a black schoolteacher at a mall food court in Brasilia. Her friends at the table nodded vigorously. ""Her experience is not the same as mine,"" said Francesca, her sister. Silva's official campaign song, unveiled last month by Gilberto Gil, probably Brazil's most famous contemporary black musician, praises her ""brown skin and popular appeal.""Some say she should be even more explicit about racial issues.""Nobody likes to say it, but there is enormous racism in Brazil,"" said William Reis, 29, a member of AfroReggae, a prominent non-profit group in Rio de Janeiro that promotes black culture in the city's slums.""Young people want our politicians to talk about this. It's a reality. Why don't we debate it?"" A RACIAL DEMOCRACY? An estimated 5 million Africans were brought to Brazil between 1525 and 1866, compared to about 450,000 who were taken to the United States, according to the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Database, compiled by academics.Segregation was never enforced in Brazil as it was in the United States and South Africa. When the American South was roiled by the civil rights movement in the 1960s, Brazilian leaders proudly proclaimed their country a ""racial democracy.""Yet many now believe such rhetoric was aimed at papering over the very real racial divisions in Brazilian society.In the country's favelas, or slums, there are more people of African descent than society at large. Historians say that's a legacy of slavery, as the descendants of slaves did not have equal access to schools or jobs.Even today, at children's birthday parties in rich neighborhoods of Sao Paulo or Rio de Janeiro, the only black people present are often women in all-white uniforms, working as nannies or maids.Blacks and pardos account for roughly a fifth of university students. That is five times higher than in 1997, thanks in part to new racial quotas implemented under Workers' Party rule, but still less than their share of the population.Barbosa, who became Brazil's first black Supreme Court justice in 2003 and retired this year, spoke often about the country's ""latent, veiled racism."" He cited what he called the overwhelming lack of blacks in Brazil's government.In some contexts, race is treated with an openness that often shocks foreigners. For example, kiosks on Rio's Copacabana beach rate the danger sunbathers face from ultraviolet rays, breaking down the risk into four categories: ""whites and blonds,"" ""light browns,"" ""dark browns"" and ""mulattoes and blacks.""Racial matters have also crept more into politics in recent years. When Rousseff was jeered by the crowd at the World Cup's opening match in Sao Paulo in June, she blamed the hostility on the city's ""white elite."" Those who could afford the game's high ticket prices were also the ones who have most opposed her government's social programs, other officials said.      CHANGING TACTICS Rousseff's campaign has delicately sought to highlight her record on racial issues. One adviser pointed to a recent TV ad that shows a black student in a university classroom. A narrator says such people used to be ""invisible.""That said, the economic growth that made social gains possible has slowed under Rousseff. Many economists believe that Silva's proposals, including a simplification of the tax code and a push for greater trade, would stoke the growth needed to ensure continued progress for blacks, and the poor more generally.Some observers expect that Silva could adopt new tactics once she is safely into the runoff. For example, by making it clearer how black Brazilians in particular would benefit from her policies, or talking more about her background.Yet her opponents, including Rousseff's minister for the promotion of racial equality, Luiza Bairros, say it won't be easy for Silva to refashion her message.Asked why Silva has not generated more support among blacks, Bairros smiled, peered over her glasses and said: ""Do you really think Obama would have won 95 percent (of the black vote) if he had been a Republican?"" ""What a black person knows in Brazil, or anywhere else in the world is that their situation won't improve unless you have ... policies that lead to change.""""The symbolic part is important,"" she said. ""But it's not everything.""

""The joint venture partners made this decision after careful consideration,"" the statement said. ""The service had not been as successful as either partner hoped it would be."" Subscribers will receive an email notifying them of the termination of the service. A separate email will be sent on Oct. 10 with details on refunds, the statement said. The alliance marked Verizon's first foray into video streaming outside its network operating region, but it never gained a foothold against online rivals such as Netflix, Amazon.com Inc and Hulu Plus.The telephone company had only offered Web video services to subscribers using its FiOS TV service, which competes with cable providers such as Comcast Corp and Time Warner Cable .

425,"  (Adds Amazon comment in 10th paragraph)By Mica RosenbergNEW YORK Oct 7 The U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments on Wednesday on whether companies have to pay workers for time spent undergoing security checks, in a case challenging how hourly employees are compensated for tasks outside the regular work shift.Employees of Integrity Staffing Solutions, an Amazon.com Inc  contractor handling merchandise shipped out of vast warehouses, brought a class-action lawsuit in Nevada in 2010, claiming they were forced to spend up to a half hour daily without pay while they went through security screenings aimed at protecting against theft.Led by employee Jessie Busk, the workers sued for back wages and overtime pay.In April, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals found the screenings were an integral part of the warehousing job, done for the benefit of the employer and should be compensated under the federal Fair Labor Standards Act.""This case has implications for every hourly paid worker,"" said Mark Thierman, Busk's Nevada-based lawyer. ""The employers get to call the work day over and then give you more work."" Integrity Staffing asked the Supreme Court to reconsider the opinion from the San Francisco-based 9th Circuit, which had reversed a lower court decision.Retail groups, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and local governments say the appeals court ruling, if upheld, could lead to hundreds of millions of dollars in potential liabilities for employers.The U.S. Solicitor General's office also backed the warehousing company's position in a 'friend of the court' brief. The government took a position as a large public sector employer that often requires employees to undergo security checks. The company and the government both argue that the security checks are not central to warehouse work and instead are more like waiting in line to punch a time clock, an activity some courts have found does not require compensation.Amazon, the world's largest online retailer, is not directly involved in the lawsuit. An Amazon spokeswoman said the company has ""a long standing practice of not commenting on pending litigation, but data shows that employees walk through post shift security screening with little or no wait.""The Retail Litigation Center, in a brief supporting the warehousing company, said the industry in general loses $16 billion annually because of thefts. Costs to companies could rise if retailers are forced to scale back security checks or pay workers for more time, said Edward Brill, an attorney from Proskauer Rose who filed the retailers' brief. Those costs could then conceivably be passed along to customers, he said.Former Secretary of Labor Robert Reich said he was surprised the Solicitor General sided with Integrity Staffing in this case.""Certainly the Labor Department is looking for ways, as is the White House, to raise wages rather than reduce wages,"" said Reich, now a University of California, Berkeley professor. ""I would have expected the Solicitor General's office to be on the side of the employees.""Spokesmen from Integrity Staffing Solutions and the U.S. Department of Labor declined to comment on the litigation.The case is Integrity Staffing Solutions, Inc v.

432,"   By Foo Yun Chee | BRUSSELS  BRUSSELS Amazon's tax arrangements with Luxembourg are being investigated by EU regulators, as the online retailer becomes the latest global company to be accused of striking tax-minimising deals with member states that may break bloc rules.Corporate tax avoidance has come under the spotlight on both sides of the Atlantic in recent years, as perfectly legal deals with authorities help companies save millions of dollars but which critics say is a form of subsidy at ordinary taxpayers' expense.The European Commission is examining whether Luxembourg broke EU state aid rules by agreeing a deal which allows Amazon to operate almost tax free in Europe.Amazon is structured so that all online sales in Europe are technically between customers and a Luxembourg company. Despite racking up almost 14 billion euros of sales each year, Amazon's main European subsidiary, Amazon EU Sarl, reports almost no profit.That is at least partly because it pays hefty fees to its immediate parent Amazon Europe Holding Technologies SCS (AEHT), a tax exempt partnership, in return for using Amazon intellectual property.The Commision said it was investigating a 2003 deal between Amazon and Luxembourg that underpins this arrangement. The Commission said the agreement could give Amazon an economic advantage over other companies without such rulings.The U.S. company denied receiving preferential treatment. ""Amazon has received no special tax treatment from Luxembourg, we are subject to the same tax laws as other companies operating here,"" it said in a statement.U.S. BATTLE  Luxembourg's finance ministry said there was no wrongdoing.""Luxembourg is confident that the allegations of state aid in this case are unsubstantiated and that the Commission investigation will conclude that no special tax treatment or advantage has been awarded to Amazon,"" it said in a statement. Amazon is already locked in a court battle with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service over the arrangement by which the Luxembourg partnership came to enjoy the rights to sell on Amazon's intellectual property outside the United States. In court filings, Amazon has denied undercharging AEHT for these rights. Companies found guilty of breaching EU rules on state aid could be forced to repay what Brussels determines to have been the amount of support given.Amazon joins fellow U.S. company Apple in the Commission's sights after the watchdog accused Ireland of swerving international tax rules in its tax arrangements with the iPhone maker. The Commission is also investigating similar deals between coffee chain Starbucks Corp and the Netherlands and Luxembourg tax rulings received by a subsidiary of Italian carmaker Fiat.For a Reuters story on Amazon's tax structure in Luxembourg, click here (Additional reporting by Phil Blenkinsop, and Tom Bergin in London; Editing by David Goodman and Pravin Char)",2014-10-08,AMZN,"Wed Oct 8, 2014 | 12:41pm EDT",EU watchdog targets Amazon's Luxembourg tax deals,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-eu-amazon-com-tax-idUSKCN0HW0PP20141008?type=companyNews
433,"   By Lawrence Hurley | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Oct 8 The U.S. Supreme Court appeared divided on Wednesday over whether companies must pay workers for time spent undergoing security checks at the end of their shifts in a case involving an Amazon.com Inc  contractor.Employees of Integrity Staffing Solutions facilities in Nevada, where merchandise is processed and shipped, say they are forced to spend up to half an hour daily going through security screenings aimed at protecting against theft. They say they should be paid for their time and have asked for back wages and overtime pay.During Wednesday's oral argument in the closely watched employment law case, Justice Elena Kagan indicated that the security checks are similar to the checking-out process bank tellers and cashiers have to go through at the end of their shifts. Workers would likely be paid in those scenarios, she said. ""What's the difference between that ... and going through security at Amazon?"" Kagan asked. Justice Anthony Kennedy, the court's frequent swing vote, followed up with a similar line of questioning. Other justices on the conservative wing sounded more sympathetic to the employer, saying the screening process was not a key part of the employees' jobs and therefore was not subject to compensation.In April, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals found the screenings were an integral part of the warehousing job done for the benefit of the employer and should be compensated under the federal Fair Labor Standards Act. A ruling is due by June.The case is Integrity Staffing Solutions, Inc v. Jesse Busk and Laurie Castro, U.S. Supreme Court, No. 13-433.

434,"   By Todd Spangler  LOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - Amazon Studios has ordered a second season of Jill Soloway's dark comedy ""Transparent,"" with the company saying the freshman run has been No. 1 on Prime Instant Video since its launch two weeks ago.The show, starring Jeffrey Tambor as a transgendered parent who comes out to the L.A. family's adult kids, is the most-binge-watched show even on Amazon's Prime Instant Video, according to the company. Nearly 80% of viewers have watched two or more episodes of ""Transparent"" in the same day, according to Amazon. The second season is slated to hit Amazon in 2015. ""Our goal is to create series that customers love, so it's great to hear that 'Transparent' has not only risen to the No. 1 series on Prime Instant Video, but that it's deemed 'binge-worthy' as well,"" Amazon Studios VP Roy Price said in a statement. ""Given all the great feedback, it only makes sense to bring the Pfeffermans back next year in season two."" However, like Netflix, Amazon does not release actual viewing metrics although the ecommerce company publishes relative rankings of the most popular content on Prime Instant Video. Amazon also touted the critical reception for ""Transparent,"" noting that the show has a 98% critic rating Rotten Tomatoes and a 91 score on Metacritic. Variety's Brian Lowry said the series ""establishes its ensemble as one worth watching (or bingeing) over 10 episodes,"" representing ""the sort of breakthrough destined to firmly put Amazon's nascent original programming push on the map.""All 10 half-hour episodes of ""Transparent"" season one debuted exclusively on Prime Instant Video on Sept. 26. The series, which Amazon describes as ""novelistic,"" stars Tambor (""Arrested Development"") as Maura, who has spent her life as Mort, patriarch of the Pfefferman family patriarch. ""Transparent"" also stars Judith Light (""Dallas""), Gaby Hoffmann (""Girls""), Amy Landecker (""Louie"") and Jay Duplass (""Togetherness"").",2014-10-09,AMZN,"Thu Oct 9, 2014 | 6:45pm EDT",Amazon Renews 'Transparent' for Season 2,http://www.reuters.com//article/variety-idUSL2N0S436220141009?type=companyNews

439,"   By Kirsti Knolle and Georgina Prodhan | FRANKFURT  FRANKFURT For any author frustrated by rejections from publishing houses or wanting to cut out the middle man, there has never been an easier or cheaper time to self-publish.A host of free self-publishing platforms offered by Amazon, Apple and specialists like Smashwords have created new opportunities and a huge market for both unknown hopefuls and a few established writers.Hailed as democratizing the market by some and decried as cheapening literary culture by others, self-publishing has transformed what it means to be an author. Simply uploading a PDF file and making a small outlay for cover design can turn anyone into a published writer on an ebook platform like Amazon's Kindle, earning up to 70 percent of the cover price.The traditional role of the publishing house - sifting through manuscripts, editing those selected and packaging, marketing and distributing the finished book - is eliminated. The publishers aren't too worried, though. Self-publishing can work to their advantage, too.E.L. James is an example. Her ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" was self-published. Then it was picked up by Random House and became the fastest-selling paperback of all time, propelling James to the top of the Forbes list of highest-earning authors in 2013.Few self-published writers will see that kind of success. But those who actively promote their own work and price their titles keenly enough - sometimes as little as 99 cents a copy - can break through to a mass audience.""A lot of self-published books, while they're not up to the standard that established publishers would want, are good enough,"" said Edward Nawotka, editor-in-chief of online magazine Publishing Perspectives.""They are priced at a point that meet the reader's demand,"" he told Reuters during the Frankfurt Book Fair. ""I think it's expanded the market for books.""STIGMA Almost half a million titles were self-published last year in the United States alone, an increase of 17 percent year-on- year and 400 percent since 2008, bibliographic information firm Bowker wrote in a report last week. The global market is still largely uncharted. ""Self-publishing is beginning to mature ... It is evolving from a frantic, wild-West style space to a more serious business,"" wrote Beat Barblan, who heads the Bowker department that hands out unique identifier numbers for books, or ISBNs.Mark Coker, who founded Smashwords after having his own co-authored novel rejected by publishers and now helps almost 100,000 authors, wrote in a recent blog post: ""The stigma that once haunted self-published authors is quickly melting away.""Self-publishing has a long tradition. The world might never have read Charles Dickens's ""A Christmas Carol"", Mark Twain's ""The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn"" or James Joyce's ""Ulysses"" had the authors not taken matters into their own hands.Still, many self-published authors publish only one book and reach a small audience. Ingram, the world's biggest book distributor, says its average self-published title sells 100 copies in print or digital, and a 2012 survey by content marketing firm Taleist found half of self-published authors earned less than $500 per year.To make a living takes incredible luck, or determination and hard-headed business sense, as German fantasy-fiction author Ina Koerner knows. She has sold more than 300,000 books via Amazon under her pen name, Marah Woolf.""You have to deliver a book every half year, otherwise you will be forgotten,"" the 42-year-old mother of three told Reuters at the Frankfurt Book Fair, the world's biggest book trade gathering. ""I write for a market and the book is a product.""Koerner, who trained as a banker and was rejected by 15 publishing houses before taking the decision to self-publish, logs onto her Facebook account daily to keep in touch with her 2,500 fans, and posts on her blog at least once a month.""I have little understanding for authors who think they have written 'the' book but no one sees it,"" she said. ADDITIVE, NOT CANNIBALISTIC Success also takes a degree of humility and realism.Koerner prices her books at 2.99 euros ($3.79). She earns 2 euros for herself; Amazon takes the remaining 99 cents.Penelope Ward's self-published teen romance ""Stepbrother Dearest"", which debuted at number 2 on the ebook bestsellers list last week, was priced at $2.99, compared with an average price of $7.74 for the top 25 titles.The popularity of this kind of genre fiction has contributed to the decline of imprints such as Harlequin or Mills and Boon. But it has had minimal impact on the rest of the industry, which could barely cover its costs at the prices typically charged.""We believe the rapid rise of self-publishing is more additive than cannibalistic, and will generate a few, but only a few, hits,"" analyst Douglas McCabe of Enders Analysis wrote.(Corrects spelling of writer's pen name in 16th paragraph.)

Both complained about the stronger dollar putting the skids on their forecasts, lowering the value of overseas sales once converted into the U.S. currency.But analysts say stagnant incomes are also prompting U.S. consumers to curtail spending.""EBay, especially on the marketplaces side, is actually suffering from company-specific setbacks,"" Wedbush Securities analyst Gil Luria said. ""But overall, if e-commerce was growing faster or as fast as it was last year or a couple years ago, it would have probably helped them hide that.""DOLLARS AND CENTS  EBay's fourth-quarter outlook was undercut by the strength of the dollar against the British pound, the euro and the Australian dollar, which together account for 35 percent of eBay's volume.The stronger dollar alone forced eBay to cut its fourth-quarter revenue outlook by $120 million. Coupled with slower-than-expected growth in its marketplaces division, eBay was forced to lop off $300 million from its annual revenue forecast.""As expected, (retail) sales have accelerated in the second half of the year, though economic signals remain mixed and consumers are still facing headwinds such as weak income growth,"" Moody's analyst Michael Zuccaro wrote on Wednesday. The more measured tone may spook investors as retailers such as Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and Target (TGT.N) release results over the next month. Investors and analysts had expressed high hopes for the holiday season as recently as last week. The National Retail Federation, in a press release entitled “optimism shines,” predicted strengthening consumer confidence would trigger a 4.1 percent spike in November-December retail sales, outpacing the 3.1 percent seen in the same period of 2013.But the group also warned that consumers remained uneasy about economic conditions, echoing concerns from other analysts including those at Moody's.Two-thirds of Americans are limiting how much they spend each month, according to a Bankrate.com report released this week. The top reason was stagnant incomes. eBay Chief Executive John Donahoe told Reuters he was ""cautiously optimistic"" about the holiday season but declined to discuss the topic further.In a sign of its cautious view on the U.S. market, Wal-Mart said it would slow store openings in the next fiscal year.Wal-Mart, which recorded $473.1 billion in sales in its last fiscal year, said it now expects sales to rise 2-3 percent in the current year to Jan. 31, 2015. It had previously estimated growth at the low end of a 3-5 percent range.Lower gasoline prices had been expected to fuel higher retail sales this winter, especially at Wal-Mart and other chains that cater to low- to middle-income shoppers, analysts said.

DOLLARS AND CENTS EBay's fourth-quarter outlook was undercut by the strength of the dollar against the British pound, the euro and the Australian dollar, which together account for 35 percent of eBay's volume.The stronger dollar alone forced eBay to cut its fourth-quarter revenue outlook by $120 million. Coupled with slower-than-expected growth in its marketplaces division, eBay was forced to lop off $300 million from its annual revenue forecast. ""As expected, (retail) sales have accelerated in the second half of the year, though economic signals remain mixed and consumers are still facing headwinds such as weak income growth,"" Moody's analyst Michael Zuccaro wrote on Wednesday.The more measured tone may spook investors as retailers such as Amazon.com Inc and Target release results over the next month. Investors and analysts had expressed high hopes for the holiday season as recently as last week.The National Retail Federation, in a press release entitled ""optimism shines,"" predicted strengthening consumer confidence would trigger a 4.1 percent spike in November-December retail sales, outpacing the 3.1 percent seen in the same period of 2013. But the group also warned that consumers remained uneasy about economic conditions, echoing concerns from other analysts including those at Moody's.Two-thirds of Americans are limiting how much they spend each month, according to a Bankrate.com report released this week. The top reason was stagnant incomes.eBay Chief Executive John Donahoe told Reuters he was ""cautiously optimistic"" about the holiday season but declined to discuss the topic further.In a sign of its cautious view on the U.S. market, Wal-Mart said it would slow store openings in the next fiscal year.Wal-Mart, which recorded $473.1 billion in sales in its last fiscal year, said it now expects sales to rise 2-3 percent in the current year to Jan. 31, 2015. It had previously estimated growth at the low end of a 3-5 percent range.Lower gasoline prices had been expected to fuel higher retail sales this winter, especially at Wal-Mart and other chains that cater to low- to middle-income shoppers, analysts said.

448,"  (Adds CEO comment)By Lisa RichwineOct 15 Netflix Inc signed up fewer video streaming subscribers than forecast for the quarter that ended in September as its U.S. growth slowed markedly, sending its shares plunging as much as 27 percent.The company blamed a $1 price hike to $8.99 a month for discouraging new sign-ups. It lured 3.02 million new streaming customers globally, versus the 3.69 million it projected in July. (bit.ly/1sK5iPy)Netflix attracted about 980,000 new customers in the United States, its largest market, down from 1.29 million in the same period a year earlier.The news came after Time Warner Inc's HBO said on Wednesday it will offer new competition next year with a streaming service that does not require a pay TV subscription.""Year-on-year net additions in the U.S. were down,"" Netflix  said in a quarterly letter to shareholders. ""As best we can tell, the primary cause is the slightly higher prices we now have compared to a year ago."" Shares of Netflix fell 25 percent to $333.53 in after-hours trading, from their $448.59 close on Nasdaq.Netflix, waving off fears that a standalone HBO would draw users away, argued that many will subscribe to both services because they offer different shows.""It is likely we both prosper as consumers move to Internet TV,"" the company's letter said.Chief Executive Reed Hastings said in an interview that he expected other premium channels such as Showtime and Starz to sell programming directly to consumers. CBS-owned  Showtime said it was weighing such a move. Starz has announced plans to offer that type of service overseas. Netflix has invested in original series such as ""House of Cards"" and ""Orange is the New Black"" to compete with HBO, Amazon.com Inc and on-demand offerings from pay TV providers.Netflix also is pushing into original movies, financing four Adam Sandler films and a sequel to martial-arts drama ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.""The HBO news, overall stock market weakness, and the subscriber forecast miss likely sparked the share selloff, Hudson Square Research analyst Daniel Ernst. But he said Netflix has proven it can bounce back from disappointing quarters. ""They have got a good track record in growing past this turbulence,"" said Ernst, who rates Netflix a ""buy.""The company forecast it will add 4 million streaming subscribers in the fourth quarter.Netflix expanded into six European countries in September. Its international subscribers grew 72 percent to 15.84 million from a year earlier.Net income rose to $59.3 million, or 96 cents per share, from $31.8 million, or 52 cents per share, in the year-ago period.Revenue rose about 28 percent to $1.41 billion.Analysts had expected profit of 93 cents per share on revenue of $1.41 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

453,"  SAO PAULO The Brazilian government said on Tuesday it has put an environmentally rich area of the Amazon rainforest under federal protection, creating a reserve larger than the U.S. state of Delaware. The new reserve, called Alto Maues, has 6,680 square km (668,000 hectares or 1.65 million acres) of mostly untouched forests that are not known to have human presence, the Brazilian Environment Ministry said.Declaring a federal reserve means forest clearing and similar development are forbidden.Putting large areas of mostly intact rainforest under federal protection is one of the tools the Brazilian government has to combat deforestation and reduce its greenhouse gas emissions.The creation of these reserves is part of the country's climate policy. Deforestation is the main cause of carbon emissions in Brazil, unlike most countries where the burning of fossil fuels leads emissions. The decree creating the reserve was eagerly expected by environmental groups.""This is essential to protect unique Amazon species, such as some types of primates,"" said Mauro Armelin, a conservationist working for the local office of the World Wildlife Fund (WWF). WWF said at least 13 species of primates and more than 600 species of birds are found in the Alto Maues area.The organization, however, said that declaring the area a federal conservation unit does not guarantee its integrity.  Amazon deforestation went up in Brazil last year for the first time since 2008, as illegal loggers and land grabbers increased their activities, challenging government controls.

459,"   By Deepa Seetharaman | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Amazon.com Inc's (AMZN.O) sales projections for the crucial holiday quarter disappointed Wall Street and third-quarter results missed forecasts, sending the online retailer's shares 9 percent lower on Thursday.After an unusually busy first half of the year that saw the online retailer spend on developing everything from mobile phones and Hollywood-style production to grocery deliveries, investors were ready to see it curtail its ambitions and start delivering sustainable profits.But not only did it post a much larger loss than expected, Amazon also projected 7 to 18 percent revenue growth over the busiest shopping period of the year, a far cry from the 20 percent-plus pace that had convinced investors to overlook its persistent lack of profit in the past.""That kind of takes the topline growth story off the table. And now they've got to deliver on profit margins,"" said Rob Plaza, senior analyst at Key Private Bank. ""Because of all that money they need to spend to drive growth, it becomes an expensive proposition.""Thursday's after-hours share losses wipe more than $15 billion off of Amazon's market value. The stock had already been down 13 percent since Amazon's last quarterly results announcement in July, when it also missed targets and ignited a debate about its free spending ways. Some analysts fear that the U.S. holiday shopping season, the biggest quarter for most retailers, might turn out weaker than anticipated. Amazon projected on Thursday net sales of between $27.3 billion and $30.3 billion for the holiday quarter, lagging the $30.89 billion analysts had expected on average.Chief Financial Officer Tom Szkutak told reporters a stronger dollar had reduced its fourth-quarter revenue forecast by about 2.5 percentage points. A stronger dollar means overseas revenue translates to less in the home currency.He added that Amazon sales in Japan in the third-quarter failed to recover from their second-quarter decline. The earnings report comes about a week after e-commerce rival eBay Inc trimmed its own full-year revenue outlook due in part to the stronger U.S. dollar. For the just-finished third quarter, Amazon missed on virtually every metric that Wall Street tracks.Its third-quarter net loss widened to $437 million or 95 cents per share in the third quarter, from $41 million a 9 cents a year ago. That came in larger than forecasts for a loss of 74 cents a share. Revenue also fell short of expectations. Net sales rose to $20.58 billion, but that lagged forecasts for $20.84 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Shares in the company slid more than 9 percent to $284 in extended trade.""It was an ugly quarter,"" Plaza said.

461,"   By Nick Carey | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Determined not to repeat a holiday season that left millions of packages delivered too late and customers seething, United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) and FedEx Corp (FDX.N) are investing heavily in new infrastructure - but the continued dynamic growth of e-commerce will test those efforts. The world's two largest shipping companies are building new facilities, adding more temporary holiday workers and pushing retailers to help them avoid a recurrence of a pre-Christmas shipping logjam. Even so, the rise in shipping originating with e-tailers including Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and Zappos could test even the new capacity levels. Peak days at both companies now equal roughly double their average daily volumes. Mark Wallace, vice president of engineering in the United States at UPS, said the company still has volume limits, despite substantial investment this year. ""There is only so much capacity in the network.""A late spike in demand last year caused by last-minute online promotions plagued express delivery companies. Some 2 million express packages were left stranded by delivery companies on Christmas Eve, according to shipment-tracking software developer ShipMatrix Inc. UPS experienced far more severe problems than FedEx.  This year, UPS has allocated $500 million to expand and improve facilities and is hiring 95,000 seasonal workers - or 10,000 more than last year - to handle 2014 holiday packages.During its second-quarter conference call, UPS Chief Executive David Abney said ""these projects will weigh on earnings in 2014"" but pay off long-term. A spokesman declined to comment further ahead of UPS's next quarterly earnings, expected to be released on Friday.  FedEx has said up to 90 percent of its $1.2 billion investments this year are to boost capacity. The company plans to hire 50,000 seasonal workers, up from 40,000 last year. Patrick Fitzgerald, senior vice president of marketing and communications at FedEx, said this year's capital investments would not affect the company's earnings forecast.The investment is designed to address the rapid growth of consumer goods ordered online. Through 2013, peak volume, referring to the busiest day of the year, had climbed 57 percent over five years at FedEx, to 22 million packages. It jumped 40 percent at UPS, to 31 million packages.  Deloitte LLP predicts sales growth of up to 14 percent this holiday season, and FedEx said on Wednesday it expected peak-day package volumes to reach 22.6 million this year. The peaks have become more pronounced closer to Christmas as last-minute online free shipping deals have proliferated. Unchecked, those peaks will only grow worse, experts said. ""The e-commerce shipping model isn't sustainable in its current form,"" said Yossi Sheffi, a professor of engineering systems and director of the Center for Transportation & Logistics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). ""You cannot build a shipping network to operate 365 days a year based on a spike in packages three days before Christmas.""         PROTECTING THE CORE  In a bid to better manage the peak, the shipping giants have asked retailers for clearer estimates of 2014 holiday volumes and have encouraged earlier deadlines for consumer orders. ""We now have the kind of visibility we didn't before on what to expect from our largest customers,"" said UPS's Wallace.FedEx's Fitzgerald said customers could be disappointed if they offer last-minute sales without first consulting FedEx. ""If we don't have the right discussions up-front, we may not be ready to handle"" a sudden surge, Fitzgerald said.  In mid-August, Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) gave its carriers its peak forecast, both by day and by shipping facility, three weeks earlier than usual. Contingency plans include shipping from alternate Wal-Mart distribution centers or upgrading packages to faster services if ""deemed at risk"" of missing Christmas, said spokeswoman Jaeme Lazckowski.Nordstrom Inc (JWN.N) has moved up its cutoff point for Christmas deliveries by three hours on Dec. 23, and UPS has agreed to additional last-minute flights for the company.   FedEx and UPS had no choice but to engage retailers in reducing peak loads and getting them to manage consumer expectations on realistic delivery deadlines, said veteran Cowan & Co analyst Helane Becker. ""They can't keep trying to squeeze more and more through such a narrow funnel,"" she said. Both FedEx and UPS are concerned about impact on their core business-to-business customers.  ""When packages went undelivered last year, that also affected high-volume business customers,"" said Rick Jones, a former UPS executive and now CEO of regional delivery company Lone Star Overnight. ""Have no doubt this is not about getting little Johnny his Christmas present. It's about protecting that core business.""Logistics experts say the 2014 adjustments are a temporary fix, and more changes are needed for the 2015 holiday season. A price hike might help tackle ubiquitous free shipping offers, and negotiations with Amazon, in particular, likely will occur.  ""What you will see is Amazon Prime with a little minus for the three days before Christmas - where free shipping doesn't apply,"" said MIT's Sheffi. ""And Amazon will be able to blame UPS for it anyway.""Amazon declined specific comment. ""We work very closely with all of our delivery partners and are confident in their ability to deliver for Amazon customers this holiday,"" the company said in a statement. FedEx's Fitzgerald said the company does not plan a 2015 price increase ""at this point."" A UPS spokesman said the company has focused on fixing last year's problems instead of pricing.

463,"  (Adds Breakingviews link)By Deepa SeetharamanSAN FRANCISCO Oct 23 Amazon.com Inc's  sales projections for the crucial holiday quarter disappointed Wall Street and third-quarter results missed forecasts, sending the online retailer's shares 9 percent lower on Thursday.After an unusually busy first half of the year that saw the online retailer spend on developing everything from mobile phones and Hollywood-style production to grocery deliveries, investors were ready to see it curtail its ambitions and start delivering sustainable profits.But not only did it post a much larger loss than expected, Amazon also projected 7 to 18 percent revenue growth over the busiest shopping period of the year, a far cry from the 20 percent-plus pace that had convinced investors to overlook its persistent lack of profit in the past.""That kind of takes the topline growth story off the table. And now they've got to deliver on profit margins,"" said Rob Plaza, senior analyst at Key Private Bank.""Because of all that money they need to spend to drive growth, it becomes an expensive proposition."" Thursday's after-hours share losses wipe more than $15 billion off of Amazon's market value. The stock had already been down 13 percent since Amazon's last quarterly results announcement in July, when it also missed targets and ignited a debate about its free spending ways.Some analysts fear that the U.S. holiday shopping season, the biggest quarter for most retailers, might turn out weaker than anticipated.Amazon projected on Thursday net sales of between $27.3 billion and $30.3 billion for the holiday quarter, lagging the $30.89 billion analysts had expected on average. Chief Financial Officer Tom Szkutak told reporters a stronger dollar had reduced its fourth-quarter revenue forecast by about 2.5 percentage points. A stronger dollar means overseas revenue translates to less in the home currency.He added that Amazon sales in Japan in the third-quarter failed to recover from their second-quarter decline.The earnings report comes about a week after e-commerce rival eBay Inc trimmed its own full-year revenue outlook due in part to the stronger U.S. dollar. For the just-finished third quarter, Amazon missed on virtually every metric that Wall Street tracks.Its third-quarter net loss widened to $437 million or 95 cents per share in the third quarter, from $41 million a 9 cents a year ago. That came in larger than forecasts for a loss of 74 cents a share.Revenue also fell short of expectations. Net sales rose to $20.58 billion, but that lagged forecasts for $20.84 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Shares in the company slid more than 9 percent to $284 in extended trade.""It was an ugly quarter,"" Plaza said.

464,"   By Nick Carey | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Oct 23 Determined not to repeat a holiday season that left millions of packages delivered too late and customers seething, United Parcel Service Inc and FedEx Corp are investing heavily in new infrastructure - but the continued dynamic growth of e-commerce will test those efforts.The world's two largest shipping companies are building new facilities, adding more temporary holiday workers and pushing retailers to help them avoid a recurrence of a pre-Christmas shipping logjam.Even so, the rise in shipping originating with e-tailers including Amazon.com Inc and Zappos could test even the new capacity levels. Peak days at both companies now equal roughly double their average daily volumes.Mark Wallace, vice president of engineering in the United States at UPS, said the company still has volume limits, despite substantial investment this year. ""There is only so much capacity in the network.""A late spike in demand last year caused by last-minute online promotions plagued express delivery companies.  Some 2 million express packages were left stranded by delivery companies on Christmas Eve, according to shipment-tracking software developer ShipMatrix Inc. UPS experienced far more severe problems than FedEx.This year, UPS has allocated $500 million to expand and improve facilities and is hiring 95,000 seasonal workers - or 10,000 more than last year - to handle 2014 holiday packages.During its second-quarter conference call, UPS Chief Executive David Abney said ""these projects will weigh on earnings in 2014"" but pay off long-term. A spokesman declined to comment further ahead of UPS's next quarterly earnings, expected to be released on Friday.FedEx has said up to 90 percent of its $1.2 billion investments this year are to boost capacity. The company plans to hire 50,000 seasonal workers, up from 40,000 last year. Patrick Fitzgerald, senior vice president of marketing and communications at FedEx, said this year's capital investments would not affect the company's earnings forecast.The investment is designed to address the rapid growth of consumer goods ordered online. Through 2013, peak volume, referring to the busiest day of the year, had climbed 57 percent over five years at FedEx, to 22 million packages. It jumped 40 percent at UPS, to 31 million packages. Deloitte LLP predicts sales growth of up to 14 percent this holiday season, and FedEx said on Wednesday it expected peak-day package volumes to reach 22.6 million this year.The peaks have become more pronounced closer to Christmas as last-minute online free shipping deals have proliferated. Unchecked, those peaks will only grow worse, experts said.""The e-commerce shipping model isn't sustainable in its current form,"" said Yossi Sheffi, a professor of engineering systems and director of the Center for Transportation & Logistics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). ""You cannot build a shipping network to operate 365 days a year based on a spike in packages three days before Christmas."" PROTECTING THE CORE In a bid to better manage the peak, the shipping giants have asked retailers for clearer estimates of 2014 holiday volumes and have encouraged earlier deadlines for consumer orders.""We now have the kind of visibility we didn't before on what to expect from our largest customers,"" said UPS's Wallace.FedEx's Fitzgerald said customers could be disappointed if they offer last-minute sales without first consulting FedEx. ""If we don't have the right discussions up-front, we may not be ready to handle"" a sudden surge, Fitzgerald said.In mid-August, Wal-Mart Stores Inc gave its carriers its peak forecast, both by day and by shipping facility, three weeks earlier than usual. Contingency plans include shipping from alternate Wal-Mart distribution centers or upgrading packages to faster services if ""deemed at risk"" of missing Christmas, said spokeswoman Jaeme Lazckowski. Nordstrom Inc has moved up its cutoff point for Christmas deliveries by three hours on Dec. 23, and UPS has agreed to additional last-minute flights for the company.FedEx and UPS had no choice but to engage retailers in reducing peak loads and getting them to manage consumer expectations on realistic delivery deadlines, said veteran Cowan & Co analyst Helane Becker. ""They can't keep trying to squeeze more and more through such a narrow funnel,"" she said.Both FedEx and UPS are concerned about impact on their core business-to-business customers.""When packages went undelivered last year, that also affected high-volume business customers,"" said Rick Jones, a former UPS executive and now CEO of regional delivery company Lone Star Overnight. ""Have no doubt this is not about getting little Johnny his Christmas present. It's about protecting that core business.""Logistics experts say the 2014 adjustments are a temporary fix, and more changes are needed for the 2015 holiday season. A price hike might help tackle ubiquitous free shipping offers, and negotiations with Amazon, in particular, likely will occur.""What you will see is Amazon Prime with a little minus for the three days before Christmas - where free shipping doesn't apply,"" said MIT's Sheffi. ""And Amazon will be able to blame UPS for it anyway.""Amazon declined specific comment. ""We work very closely with all of our delivery partners and are confident in their ability to deliver for Amazon customers this holiday,"" the company said in a statement.FedEx's Fitzgerald said the company does not plan a 2015 price increase ""at this point."" A UPS spokesman said the company has focused on fixing last year's problems instead of pricing.

468,"   By Deepa Seetharaman and Ross Kerber | SAN FRANCISCO/BOSTON  SAN FRANCISCO/BOSTON Amazon.com Inc's (AMZN.O) once fairy-tale ride on Wall Street has hit its most jarring bump yet.The company that for years enthralled investors with improbable growth and earned one of the technology sector's highest valuations drew widespread ire after a spectacular results letdown on Thursday.Amazon missed expectations across the board - on margins, on its net loss and on revenue. An unaccountably poor 7 to 18 percent revenue growth forecast for the typically strongest holiday quarter was the final straw for some.Coming just three months after a big letdown in July, the warning may represent a tipping point for investors who are already wary of a triple-digit price-earnings ratio and a persistent unwillingness to throttle back spending.""They're becoming much too distracted in all these other efforts"" outside core businesses like online retailing and web services, said Matthew Benkendorf, portfolio manager at Vontobel Asset Management. Benkendorf unloaded his Amazon holdings a year ago and said he would be skeptical of future involvement even if the stock falls further.""They are their own worst enemy to success,"" he said. ""They really need to do some soul searching and get focused.""After some rough patches following the dotcom boom, CEO Jeff Bezos for years weaved a spell over Wall Street, riding a track record for upending the retail industry with Amazon's low-cost, speedy-delivery model. But Bezos has increasingly sought leading positions in Internet computing, digital media, and on-demand services.Investors have given Bezos a lot of leeway based on past success, including the introduction of Amazon Web Services. The cloud-hosting and computing service started out as a low-cost option for cash-strapped startups but now vies successfully with IBM (IBM.N) on government and corporate IT contracts.But the company is entering a phase when many investors are expecting to see profit improvements, said Andrew Cupps, president of Cupps Capital Management in Chicago. Cupps now owns about 20,000 Amazon shares, down from around 30,000 earlier this year. Amazon shares fell 8.3 percent on Friday to a year's low of $287.06, wiping out more than $12 billion in value.Including Friday's plunge, Amazon's stock is down by nearly a third since January. Investors had begun questioning Bezos' growing spending on perceived side-projects since his company missed second-quarter profit targets. Such long-term endeavors included Hollywood-style content and mobile devices to compete with Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Google Inc (GOOGL.O). But while Amazon's original drama series ""Transparent"" has won rave reviews, the jury is still out on whether the company  can consistently deliver Netflix-style hits like ""House of Cards."" Meanwhile, its ""Fire"" smartphone project appears in trouble. The company took a $170 million writedown in the third quarter, largely because of unsold phones. And last month, it slashed the phone's price (with a two-year AT&T contract) to 99 cents from $199.That's why brokerage analysts previously enamored of Amazon's prospects struck a pessimistic note. At least 20 brokerages cut their price targets on the stock on Friday. ""Even if Bezos is unconcerned about institutional investors' near term, he needs to care how the stock impacts his ability to attract and retain talent, particularly given the broadening tech expertise he needs,"" said Macquarie's Ben Schacter. ""If the stock continues to get hit, we could even end up in a situation with activists calling for significant changes."" SICK OF IT To be sure, short interest in Amazon remains low compared with most companies, suggesting that few investors deem the company to be in trouble. But it has increased over the past six months. About a year ago, 0.3 percent of the shares available for short bets were being used for such activity.That's increased to about 1.6 percent as of Thursday, according to Markit, which tracks share lending.And despite Friday's steep target-price cuts, no brokerage yet has a sell rating on the stock. Of the 44 analysts covering Amazon, 28 have a 'buy' or higher rating on the stock, though that's down from 32 three months ago. Some still give Bezos the benefit of the doubt.""I get it that people are frustrated that they've done a lot of different things that haven't helped them that much,"" said Daniel Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust Company, which will hold onto Amazon for now. ""We'll hang in there a little longer to see if this thing will come to fruition for them.""Others have begun to waver. During Thursday's earnings call, analysts pressed Amazon on when it would see a payoff from heavy investments in China, devices and other areas. Wolfe Research analyst Aram Rubinson asked what metrics Amazon tracks ""because it's a little hard to see any of it making positive progress.""""We are at the point where they're getting sick of it,"" said John Thompson, chief executive of Vilas Capital Management, who has been shorting Amazon for about two years. He took issue in particular with executives' assertions that they rely on cash flows as one of their prime performance metrics.""They're using a cash conversion cycle – meaning, they take your money in today when you buy something, but they don't pay their supplier for 75 days. That is what creates cash flow and that's what everyone on the Street looks at,"" he said. ""That's an entirely fallacious way of valuing a company.""""If Amazon were to exit China and use the savings to buy back stock, we could easily get far more optimistic,"" Rubinson said in a separate note. ""But we are not holding our breath."" (Additional reporting by Lauren LaCapra and David Gaffen in New York. Writing by Edwin Chan.

478,"   By Liana B. Baker | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) is buying online comedy service Rooftop Media, a small deal that underscores the Internet retailer's broader ambition of becoming a media and entertainment powerhouse.Amazon is persisting in buying content to round out its service, with designs to take on Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) and other online digital media services. But that increasing spending has helped keep the company in the red, inviting criticism from investors.Audible, the audiobooks service it bought in 2008 for $300 million, is picking up the 10-person company for an undisclosed sum. Audible founder and Chief Executive Donald Katz said in a statement on Monday the company had been attracted by Rooftop's content as well as its pool of comic talent.Rooftop records comedians at clubs across the country and licenses the digital rights to thousands of hours of comedy, which is broadcast either live or later on demand. The company's media partners include Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Yahoo (YHOO.O), and it also works with streaming services such as Sirius XM (SIRI.O), Spotify and Pandora (P.N). Its content now becomes part of Audible, itself a fast-growing seller of online audiobooks, and vastly increases Rooftop's audience, said Rooftop Chief Executive Officer Will Rogers.Amazon is expected to continue acquiring digital content at a rapid clip. In past years, it began investing heavily to branch out from its online retail roots, delving into Hollywood-style content production as well as developing a line of tablets, smartphones and set-top boxes to accelerate the sale of digital content. Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos' vision of becoming a tech and media powerhouse, however, has drawn protests from an investor community that for years overlooked its lack of profits because of red-hot revenue growth.That growth may be in danger of stalling. Last week, the company missed revenue and income expectations and projected a disappointing 7 to 18 percent rise in holiday-quarter sales. Amazon's stock was up 0.6 percent on Monday but is down about a third from January.

483,"  (Adds response from company, changes first sentence to reflect that airport is inside of oil concession)LIMA Oct 28 Hundreds of indigenous community members took control of a small Amazonian airport inside Peru's biggest oil block, tribal leaders said on Tuesday, part of a dispute with Argentine energy firm Pluspetrol and the government over pollution and use of local resources.The airport, in the district of Andoas in Peru's northern region of Loreto, was occupied by native communities late on Monday, indigenous leaders Tedy Guerra and Aurelio Chino said in a phone interview.""Right now there are about 500 of us at the airport ... flights have stopped,"" said Guerra, chief of the Nuevo Andoas community.He added there had not been any clashes with police, who stepped aside.The airport mainly hosts planes used by privately held Pluspetrol, which operates the nearby oil block 1-AB. The field produces between 15,000 and 17,000 barrels per day, or about a quarter of Peru's relatively small output. Protesters are considering seizing oil wells and valves if the company does not respond to demands for negotiations, said Guerra and Chino.Guerra said the company has been using indigenous lands without asking the communities or offering fair compensation, and has been slow to clean up oil spills and leaks. Pluspetrol said it signed an agreement with the community of Nuevo Andoas in September for the use of a quarry, an arrangement that a larger indigenous group later took issue with.""Pluspetrol...is making every effort to reestablish dialogue with the community in order to overcome this impasse,"" the company said in an emailed statement.In April, Pluspetrol's output from 1-AB dropped after different native communities took control of facilities for about a week.

484,"  LOS ANGELES Nov 3 Singer Taylor Swift, whose new album is likely to have the biggest opening week of sales in a dozen years, on Monday pulled her entire catalog from online music streaming service Spotify.Singers and bands, including Beyonce and Coldplay, in the past have delayed releasing albums to Spotify to give retailers an exclusive window to sell their albums, but Swift has taken the unusual action of pulling all of her music from the service.The action may discourage Swift's fans who use the service and overshadow the singer's announcement on Monday of a world tour that is set to begin in May in Louisiana.Swift and her record label, Big Machine, requested last week that the singer's music be taken down, Spotify spokesman Graham James said.Swift wrote in an op-ed piece for the Wall Street Journal in July, ""Piracy, file sharing and streaming have shrunk the numbers of paid album sales drastically ... Music is art, and art is important and rare. Important, rare things are valuable. Valuable things should be paid for. It's my opinion that music should not be free ..."" The Swedish-British company made a public plea to Swift, saying in a blog post, ""We hope she'll change her mind and join us in building a new music economy that works for everyone.""The company said Swift's music was on 19 million playlists. The streaming service has more than 40 million users.Swift's new album, ""1989,"" was released on Oct. 27 and it is expected to top 1 million in U.S. sales when figures are released on Wednesday, trade magazine Billboard said. Big Machine declined to comment on why it asked for Swift's albums to be pulled from Spotify, a free service that also offers subscription fees to users who want to eliminate advertising.""1989"" was not available to stream on Spotify but its lead single, No. 1 hit ""Shake It Off,"" had been. Streaming music has attracted interest among technology companies such as Amazon.com Inc and Apple Inc  as album sales and downloads decline.The withholding of new music, known as ""windowing,"" is meant to encourage customers to buy albums and download songs rather than stream them online, which is less profitable.Artists and record companies have at times been at odds with Spotify over money. The company says that about 70 percent of its revenue goes to record labels and publishers, which then have their own separate agreements with artists.Big Machine founder Scott Borchetta has been vocal in the past over his dislike about how Spotify and other free streaming services compensate record labels.

""We are prepared to invest as much as it takes to grow the business,"" Jassy told reporters. He added that Amazon plans to build data centers in ""virtually every large country"" over time. Amazon stunned investors after missing quarterly results expectations across the board last month, including for margins, revenue and net loss. Investors who had long overlooked its streak of quarterly losses are worried that growth is peaking for Amazon. Building data centers around the world is an expensive endeavor.

505,"   By Lawrence Hurley | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The case of the disputed Sherlock Holmes copyright is hereby closed after the U.S. Supreme Court on Monday left intact a ruling that said 50 works featuring the famed fictional detective are in the public domain.The high court's justices, which like the eccentric detective get to decide which cases to tackle, declined to hear an appeal filed by the estate of author Arthur Conan Doyle, who died in 1930.The estate had wanted writer Leslie Klinger to pay a $5,000 license fee before a volume of new stories based on the Holmes character, famed for his genius IQ, deerstalker hat and cocaine habit, could be published.The court’s action means that the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling from June in Klinger’s favor is the final word in the case. The appeals court held that the 50 Sherlock Holmes works published before 1923 are in the public domain as copyright protections have expired.  The works depict the brilliant Victorian-era detective and include references to his sidekick Dr. Watson, his arch-enemy Professor Moriarty, 221B Baker Street, and even Holmes' cocaine use.The appeals court said only Conan Doyle's last 10 Holmes works, which were published between 1923 and 1927 and have copyrights expiring after 95 years, deserved protection. Klinger is the editor of ""The New Annotated Sherlock Holmes"" and other Holmes books. He had paid the estate a licensing fee for a prior work but sued after refusing to pay another fee for a compendium of new Holmes stories that he and co-editor Laurie King were editing, ""In the Company of Sherlock Holmes.""Their publisher, Pegasus Books, refused to publish the work after the Conan Doyle estate threatened to stop sales by Amazon.com Inc and Barnes & Noble Inc unless it received another fee. The case is Conan Doyle Estate v. Klinger, U.S. Supreme Court, No. 14-316.

513,"  BRASILIA Nov 25 Brazil extended on Tuesday a moratorium on buying soy grown in illegally cleared land in the Amazon rainforest as the government tries to protect the region, Environment Minister Izabella Teixeira said.Satellite imagery presented by Teixeira showed the area of soy grown on illegally deforested land grew 61 percent to 47,028 hectares in 2013/2014 from the previous harvest.""There was pressure from high commodity prices that led some growers to plant soy in illegally deforested areas,"" Teixeira said after signing the moratorium, which runs through May 2016, with a group of Brazil's largest soy exporting and processing firms.Environmentalists are worried that new soy export pipelines through river ports in the Amazon will add to pressure and further increase deforestation, which accelerated last year for the first time since 2005. Despite the increase in sown area, industry advocates say the area sown for soy represents just 1.1 percent of total area deforested in the three Amazon states where soy is grown - Mato Grosso, Para and Rondonia - since the moratorium took effect in 2006.""Clearly, soy is not a driver behind Amazon deforestation,"" said Carlo Lovatelli, president the Brazilian vegetable oil industry group Abiove, whose members buy 80 percent of Brazil's soy output. As the agricultural frontier expands in Brazil's Amazon region, mainly in the Mato Grosso state, experts say cattle ranching that feeds Brazil's huge meat industry is still the main cause of deforestation and the burning of trees to open grazing pastures.In September, Brazil's national space agency, which tracks deforestation via satellite imagery, said deforestation in the measurement year ending July 2013 spiked by 29 percent from a year earlier. Scientists and rainforest activists have accused President Dilma Rousseff's government of turning a blind eye to renewed abuses by loggers, ranchers and other developers in the region.The government changed forestry laws, moved ahead with big infrastructure projects in the region and eased rules that protected land long set aside for conservation, they say.Paulo Adario, senior forest adviser for the environmental group Greenpeace, said the extension of the soy moratorium will help ""avoid adding fuel to the bonfire of deforestation in the Earth's largest tropical forest.""

516,"   By Nandita Bose  CHICAGO, Nov 28,    Brick-and-mortar merchants are seeking an edge over Amazon.com Inc and other e-tailers this holiday season by encouraging customers to pick up online orders at their local store. But the tactic could raise costs - and create problems managing inventory, retail analysts and consultants said.The increased emphasis on store pick-up comes in response to last year's debacle, when millions of holiday packages were left stranded after a late surge of express-delivery orders overwhelmed retailers.Wal-Mart Stores Inc, Target Corp, Best Buy Co Inc and Lowe's Cos Inc and other merchants are combining in-store pickup with lower online prices to draw shoppers to their stores. The hope? Customers will make additional purchases.But the shift is forcing chains to carry a wider array of products and could overwhelm inventory management systems. Also: many stores might not have storage for all the extra goods.""Most retailers are still trying to figure out where is the right place to position this additional inventory...a lot of them aren't quite prepared,"" said Michael DuVall, a supply chain consultant for Strategy&, formerly Booz & Co.RISING COSTS? A supply chain consultant who works with Wal-Mart, and spoke on condition of anonymity, said the retailer's inventory costs are growing because Wal-Mart is stocking additional merchandise so it can fulfill online orders being picked up at stores.""They are having a hard time keeping that (stock) consistent with what they need,"" the consultant said. A Wal-Mart spokeswoman, in response to the consultant, said the company has inventory and processes in place for the holiday season.Best Buy CEO Hubert Joly acknowledged inventory management is a challenge. ""Stores that boost inventory to meet just the in-store pickup demand face a risk of being stuck with excess,"" Joly told Reuters. Still, he added, the chain has a lot of experience with in-store pickups. Forty percent of Best Buy's online revenue already comes from orders picked up in the store.Some retailers, meanwhile, are establishing special distribution centers called ""dark warehouses,"" partly because traditional storage facilities can't handle the small daily quantities associated with store pickup. Dark warehouses, so-named because they are almost always unmanned, cater to five to 25 stores at once. Truck drivers drop off and stock the merchandise; stores send small teams to collect the goods.A retailer might spend $1 million to set up a 100,000-square-foot dark warehouse, DuVall said, but that would still be less costly than storing the additional inventory. PROMOTING PURCHASES In-store delivery is proving popular with customers. A survey by consumer insights firm Parago showed 64 percent of consumers who placed online orders have selected in-store pickup over delivery this year - that compares with less than 4 percent a year ago.Jerry Manning, a 37-year-old office assistant in Chicago, said he chose in-store pickup for this year after holiday merchandise from Costco arrived late in 2013.""I'm not going to wait for them to show up when I can pick it up in a few hours,"" he said. Some retailers are seeking to leverage in-store visits by offering gift cards to pick-up customers. But such discounts could reduce profitability, analysts warn.""They are making money but they are also giving away margin they don't have to,"" said Eileen Kolev, of retail analytics firm Microstrategy.Retail analysts figure a one percent price cut can reduce a product's operating profit by as much as 11 percent.Lowe's CEO Robert Niblock said the company tracks gift-card promotions, including those connected to in-store pickup, to measure whether increased sales justify the discounting.""The cost of having a promotion for store pickup or in general must bring us an adequate benefit, and we track that very closely,"" Niblock said.Consultants and analysts expect any incremental sales increase to remain small, as consumer spending remains under pressure.THE ENDLESS SALE Retailers that use gift cards and other promotions as perquisites for in-store pickup may find they need to dole out such promotions during future holiday seasons, too.""It's similar to the way Black Friday started and now customers only want better offers, and all that deep discounting is only hurting the industry,"" said Anjee Solanki, national director of retail services with Colliers International.

517,"   By Girish Gupta | SCHOONORD, Guyana  SCHOONORD, Guyana As the sun rises over the Demerara River, a half dozen men gather on its west bank, tightly gripping small wooden cages.Complementing the scenic beauty of the nearby palms and sugar cane fields, male finches chirp melodiously from within their coops, affixed two-to-a-post hammered into the marshy ground.""Everybody be out here to exercise the bird, and sometimes we have a race,"" said fisherman Eric Takchand, a participant in the centuries-old Guyanese tradition.""We feed them, walk them, exercise them. They love that,"" said Takchand, 54, who has been caring for chestnut-bellied seed finches, locally known as ""towa towa"", since he was a boy.In competitions called ""races"", the winner is the first bird to chirp 50 times. This takes just a few minutes, with bets ranging from token amounts to thousands of dollars.    The men-only custom transcends social and racial divides in the former British colony on the shoulder of South America between Brazil, Venezuela and Suriname.     For more than a half century, the country has been held back by ethnic and political tensions, primarily between descendants of African slaves and those of indentured Indian servants, in a hangover from European colonial rule.    ""All backgrounds and religions come together, all because of one bird,"" said naturalist Gajendra Nauth Narine, a local celebrity known as ""Andy"" at his home across the river in Georgetown.    ""The chestnut-bellied seed finch is one of the top songbirds in the world,"" he explained, as macaws and parakeets squawked in the background.     Takchand is proud of having raised his birds, which he purchased in the country's Amazon basin interior. Some birdmen catch their own in the jungles of Guyana.    The practice, believed to have been brought over by indentured workers in the early 19th century, has also found its way to the sizable Guyanese community in New York. There, in Richmond Hill, Queens, finches are often found ""racing"" and exercising in Smokey Oval Park.     Birds from back home are prized among Guyanese in the United States and authorities occasionally catch people trying to smuggle them in through John F. Kennedy airport.    Back on the banks of the Demerara, Takchand and fellow birdman Ryan Boodho watch as their birds sing.    ""This bird has become my best friend,"" said Boodho, 34, an electronics importer. ""I was offered lots of cash for this bird but I have never sold it.""

518,"   By Atul Prakash | LONDON  LONDON Europe's postal firms need to slash costs and invest in new technology and services if they are to withstand the challenge of new entrants such as U.S. online retailer Amazon in the lucrative parcel delivery market.Companies such as Deutsche Post, whose DHL arm already offers a range of services including help with local duties and red tape on international deliveries, are best placed to cope, according to analysts. Those such as Britain's Royal Mail and Belgium's Bpost that are more focused on parcels and local markets, however, have much more to do, they added. Online shopping was supposed to be the big growth driver for postal firms in an age of instant communication. But shares in newly-privatized Royal Mail slumped 13 percent in two weeks after it warned last month that Amazon’s bid to capture a bigger slice of deliveries would cut its revenue growth prospects by at least half.Amazon has roped in newspaper and magazine distribution firm Connect for a new same-day parcel service in Britain ahead of the busy Christmas season. The so-called ""click and collect"" service -- where parcels are delivered to a pick up point rather than to a customer's door -- follows the launch of Amazon's own delivery service last year. What's more, analysts expect Amazon, and potentially others too, to start rolling out similar services across Europe's 30 billion euros-a-year parcels and express delivery market, leading many investors to flee traditional postal firms. Shares in PostNL, TNT Express and UK Mail -- as well as Royal Mail -- have fallen 20-30 percent this year. Edmund Shing, global equity fund manager at BCS Asset Management, says such firms have their work cut out.  ""Before becoming positive on the sector, I would like to see them making efforts to improve productivity, adopt technologies like softwares to optimize logistics networks, cut labor costs and have a sustainable dividend policy,"" he told Reuters. ""It's a very competitive market, growth prospects are limited and the barrier to entry is not very high. The danger for the market is that Amazon might replicate its experiment across Europe and other online companies such as eBay also launch their own delivery services to cut costs."" DELIVERING CHANGE Analysts said meeting the challenge could be painful for traditional postal firms, many of which have already slashed jobs to cope with the decline of letter deliveries and have unionized staff likely to resist more lay-offs. But some are better placed than others. Kepler Cheuvreux analyst Andre Mulder said those included more diversified firms, such as Deutsche Post and TNT Express, which have strong international freight businesses. ""TNT Express has got the biggest earnings growth potential due to cost savings,” he added, noting that TNT is aiming to cut its warehouse capacity without compromising on efficiency by rolling out new technologies, such as specialized software. Deutsche Post, meanwhile, offers a variety of services through its DHL logistics arm, including express courier, forwarding and supply-chain services that go beyond basic package delivery.This appears to be bearing fruit. Juergen Gerdes, chief executive of Post-eCommerce-Parcel at Deutsche Post DHL, told Reuters its parcel business was developing ""unbelievably and dynamically and we have only touched the tip of the potential that the future will bring.""Earlier this year, the firm said it might even re-enter markets it had exited such as France or Britain. Investors have rewarded Deutsche Post with a higher valuation than many peers. Its stock trades at 14.2 times forecast earnings against 12.3 times for Royal Mail, according to Reuters data.Other postal firms say they are also fighting back. UK Mail, for example, is investing in a new fully-automated central hub near Coventry, central England, to increase sorting capacity and cut costs.

Amazon showcased to media on Sunday ahead of Cyber Monday, the biggest online shopping day of the year.    The robots are designed to help the leading U.S. online retailer speed the time it takes to deliver items to customers and better compete with brick-and-mortar stores, where the bulk of Americans still do their shopping.The robots also may help Amazon avoid the mishaps of last year's holiday season, when a surge of packages overwhelmed shipping and logistics company UPS and delayed the arrival of Christmas presents around the globe. Amazon offered shipping refunds and $20 gift cards to compensate customers.Amazon deployed the robots this summer, ahead of the key holiday quarter, when the company typically books about one-third of its annual revenue. The updated warehouses are in five states -- California, Texas, Florida, New Jersey and Washington.     The move comes at a cost. Amazon estimated in June 2013 that it would spend about $46 million to install Kiva robots at its warehouse in Ruskin, Florida, including $26.1 million for the equipment, according to company filings to local government.    The Kiva robots have allowed Amazon to hold about 50 percent more items and shorten the time it takes to offer same-day delivery in several areas, said Dave Clark, senior vice president of worldwide operations and customer services.

526,"   By Chris Arsenault  ROME (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - More than half the carbon in the Amazon region could be released into the atmosphere unless indigenous land rights are  protected, a new study said on Tuesday, as a UN climate conference got under way in Peru. Indigenous territories and protected natural areas across nine South American countries account for more than half the carbon stored in the Amazon, the study published in the journal Carbon Management reported. If this land is exploited for logging, mining or commercial farming, much of the carbon will be released into the atmosphere, accelerating global warming, the study ""Forest Carbon in Amazonia: The Unrecognized Contributions of Indigenous Territories and Protected Natural Areas"" said. ""International recognition and investment in indigenous and protected areas are essential to ensuring their continued contribution to global climate stability,"" Richard Chase Smith, of Peruvian NGO Common Good Institute, said in a statement. Territories of Amazonian indigenous people store more forest carbon than whole tropical countries including Indonesia and the Democratic Republic of Congo, Wayne Walker, a scientist who worked on the study, said in a statement. Interest in the Amazon's resources from ranchers, mining companies and timber barons could force indigenous people off the land and contribute to deforestation, thus releasing more carbon into the atmosphere.  More than 1.3 million square kilometers of Amazonian protected areas, an area larger than the Colombian, Ecuadorean and Peruvian Amazon combined, are at risk, the study said. ""We have never been under so much pressure,"" Edwin Vásquez, president of the Indigenous Coordinating Body of the Amazon Basin, a rights group, said in a statement.  The Amazon embraces 2,344 indigenous territories and 610 protected areas. Preserving these territories would cost $2-4 billion, the study's authors said, arguing that present funding commitments for reducing deforestation could cover the expense. Destruction of carbon-rich ecosystems in the Amazon would diminish their ability to function properly, causing  potentially irreversible damage to the atmosphere, the study said.

528,"   By James Saft  It is the season of abundance, but sometimes abundance is the last thing financial markets need.Shares fell on Monday as two stories troubled investors; the low and falling price of oil and the disappointing retail takings over the Black Friday shopping weekend.Both, in their own way, were stories about the risks of abundance.Brent crude fell to its lowest in five years, down an astounding 34 percent since June. While the immediate cause of a spectacular fall last week was the failure of oil-producing nations to agree on production cuts, the fundamental story is one of new supplies coming online, particularly through fracking in the United States. Too much oil, apparently.Similarly, news that shoppers spent 11.3 percent less this year over the Thanksgiving holiday weekend sent a chill through investors, perhaps contributing to a rapid fall in the value of Apple shares. Cyber Monday, a day in which many retailers try to spark online shopping with sales, also looked slightly disappointing, according to industry projections.In the corridors of shopping malls and on the Internet, the problem perhaps wasn’t a lack of cash - think of all the money consumers are saving on gasoline - but possibly a surfeit of choice and opportunity. When shopping is always possible, always easy, it is less-compelling, less of an event of the type Black Friday marketers would wish.While both the energy and shopping stories highlight potential risks to the economy, both being potentially consistent with falling demand, both also speak to more complex risks modern investors face.There is an old adage of investing: Never bet against human ingenuity. Don’t take risks based on the idea that a given commodity will remain just as scarce, or a given business model just as defensible against competition. The rise of fracking, a technological innovation that allows the extraction of previously trapped fuels, is a case in point. Those who thought that geology meant we could  assume only a limited amount of new supplies of oil or gas have seen the value of their investments put in peril. Indeed, investment strategist Dylan Grice, now of Aeris Capital, made the same point in a prescient piece back in 2010 when he argued against the vogue for long-term allocation to commodities as an asset class.MOATS IN THE AGE OF THE INTERNET Now, to be clear, all of these surfeits are very good things if you want to heat your house or order olive oil over the Internet. But they are just not very helpful to those who already have made investments in the way crude and extra virgin have traditionally been obtained or distributed. Retail has seen its own revolution, one which is far from finished, as bricks and mortar give way to the bits and bytes of the Internet. While this has spawned all sorts of strategies among retailers, the common denominator is that it has made times continually tough, with tight margins and omnipresent competitors and far-improved price transparency.Amazon, among others, could be said to be winning this battle, but is doing so at the cost of massive investment. That  investment is supported by profits, but keeps eating them up, preventing them from being distributed to owners.Investors have reacted to this new landscape by assuming it is just a replacement for the old, run on the same lines. Poor Black Friday sales are a reminder that this may be a mistake.Take Amazon, or Facebook, or a game company like King Digital. All face far more competition than a similar business might have before the advent of the Internet. While there is justifiable excitement over start-up companies and the ease of putting world-changing ideas into effect, all exist and compete in a world in which that is true for all of the other people out there with good ideas. We now have a huge abundance not just of stuff, easy to get over the Internet, but of opportunity. Any kid with a new idea has a much better chance of putting it in place. Some might compete directly with Facebook or Amazon, but some indirectly, by attracting attention. We as investors have a historic psychological bias toward expecting advantages to be persistent. We look at Facebook now just a bit like we foolishly looked at Barnes & Noble or Sears 30 years ago.We look at a business and we get excited by its growth and revenues without truly comprehending how different the world has become.Abundance is justly celebrated, but can be dangerous to your wealth.(At the time of publication James Saft did not own any direct investments in securities mentioned in this article.

529,"   By Girish Gupta | SCHOONORD, Guyana  SCHOONORD, Guyana As the sun rises over the Demerara River, a half dozen men gather on its west bank, tightly gripping small wooden cages.Complementing the scenic beauty of the nearby palms and sugar cane fields, male finches chirp melodiously from within their coops, affixed two-to-a-post hammered into the marshy ground.""Everybody be out here to exercise the bird, and sometimes we have a race,"" said fisherman Eric Takchand, a participant in the centuries-old Guyanese tradition.""We feed them, walk them, exercise them. They love that,"" said Takchand, 54, who has been caring for chestnut-bellied seed finches, locally known as ""towa towa"", since he was a boy.In competitions called ""races"", the winner is the first bird to chirp 50 times. This takes just a few minutes, with bets ranging from token amounts to thousands of dollars.    The men-only custom transcends social and racial divides in the former British colony on the shoulder of South America between Brazil, Venezuela and Suriname.     For more than a half century, the country has been held back by ethnic and political tensions, primarily between descendants of African slaves and those of indentured Indian servants, in a hangover from European colonial rule.    ""All backgrounds and religions come together, all because of one bird,"" said naturalist Gajendra Nauth Narine, a local celebrity known as ""Andy"" at his home across the river in Georgetown.    ""The chestnut-bellied seed finch is one of the top songbirds in the world,"" he explained, as macaws and parakeets squawked in the background.     Takchand is proud of having raised his birds, which he purchased in the country's Amazon basin interior. Some birdmen catch their own in the jungles of Guyana.    The practice, believed to have been brought over by indentured workers in the early 19th century, has also found its way to the sizable Guyanese community in New York. There, in Richmond Hill, Queens, finches are often found ""racing"" and exercising in Smokey Oval Park.     Birds from back home are prized among Guyanese in the United States and authorities occasionally catch people trying to smuggle them in through John F. Kennedy airport.    Back on the banks of the Demerara, Takchand and fellow birdman Ryan Boodho watch as their birds sing.    ""This bird has become my best friend,"" said Boodho, 34, an electronics importer.

540,"  BERLIN Workers at two of Amazon.com's (AMZN.O) German warehouses went on strike on Monday as labor union Verdi sought to squeeze the online retailer in the busy pre-Christmas period in a long-running dispute over pay and conditions.A Verdi statement said that about 500 workers joined a strike at a distribution center in Bad Hersfeld, saying that pre-Christmas special offers from Amazon were increasing order volumes and pressure on workers.The union, which said it would organize more stoppages for as long as Amazon fails to meet its demands, also called on workers at a Leipzig warehouse to strike from Monday afternoon.Amazon said the vast majority of staff had not walked off the job and were working hard to meet customer expectations. It said that deliveries should not be disrupted because it can draw on a European network of 28 warehouses in seven countries. The American company employs almost 10,000 warehouse staff at nine distribution centers in Germany, its second-biggest market behind the United States, plus more than 10,000 seasonal workers. Verdi wants Amazon to raise pay for workers at its distribution centers in accordance with collective bargaining agreements across the mail order and retail industry in Germany and has organized several stoppages since May 2013. Amazon has rejected the demand, arguing that it regards warehouse staff as logistics workers and says that they receive above-average pay for that sector.

541,"   By Mitra Taj and Caroline Stauffer  LIMA/SAO PAULO (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Indians on the Peru-Brazil border say they continue to receive death threats from loggers after the murder of four local chiefs in a remote forest region overrun by illegal felling.The September slaying of Ashaninka leader Edwin Chota and three of his companions followed rising deforestation rates in the Amazon last year, and has deepened concerns that loggers will target tribes as they become more active opponents.The tensions highlight the lawlessness of one of the world's most biodiverse borders, long a flashpoint for competing visions of development and conservation.In recent years, Indians in the borderlands have clashed with outsiders seeking timber, oil, gold and control of drug trafficking routes to Brazil, where the soccer World Cup fueled demand for Peruvian cocaine.Campaign group Global Witness says the violence questions Peru’s commitment to protect its carbon-rich forests and grant land rights to native communities.Peru, which is hosting U.N. climate change talks through this week, is holding three loggers in connection with the murders. But the arrests have not slowed rampant illegal logging in the border area, nor put an end to the kind of harassment that preceded Chota’s death, villagers say.""There have been even more threats,"" Ashaninka leader Reyder Sebastian said by phone from the border region.Loggers warn villagers to stay quiet or face the same fate as Chota, using radio or shouting across rivers, said Sebastian. He has received a barrage of death threats on his cellphone since replacing Chota as a local leader, he added.Peru said police posted near the border after the murders would help ensure protection, and promised to send additional staff and resources soon.Brazil's federal police also sent troops to the region temporarily.Chota's widow Julia Perez, who gave birth to his third child last month, said Peruvian police are posted in a settlement where loggers live, across the river from her native village.""It is still not safe in the community,"" she said.Many villagers have stopped venturing deep into the forest to hunt and gather materials, fearful of a run-in with illegal loggers, said Sebastian. Others have abandoned their homes and moved to Brazil.      JUSTICE ELUSIVE Many fear the murder investigation will close without all perpetrators brought to justice.Isaac Piyako, an Ashaninka chief of Apiwtxa, Brazil, where Chota and his companions were heading the day they were gunned down, said three boats carrying eight armed men were seen near the crime scene.""There are others who financed and organized this crime,"" Piyako said. ""They could be in Brazil or Peru.""Peruvian Prosecutor Edder Farfan echoed those concerns. He said he has three arrest warrants for men linked to logging rights in the area whom he suspects ordered the murders.""The police still have not found them and that is worrisome,"" Farfan said. Two logging concessions overlapped with Saweto, where Chota lived. He said the felling of trees far surpassed legal limits.Days before the murders, a government commission from Lima inspected the concessions for the first time at the behest of Chota, according to local NGO ProPurus, which had been helping Chota.Chota had also been meeting with Ashaninka communities in Brazil, which unlike Peru has a constitutional mandate to set aside large swathes of territory for Indians. He hoped to follow their efforts to gain formal land rights, which would give the Ashaninka more power to keep out loggers.In Peru, some 1,160 native communities have sought and failed to secure titles to ancestral lands in the past 30 years, according to indigenous federation Aidesep.Chota's death prompted Peruvian President Ollanta Humala's government to promise Saweto the land title Chota had sought for more than a decade. But the titling process has hit snags, with the central and regional governments blaming each other for delays.Environmental groups say strengthening native land rights slows deforestation and the release of greenhouse gas emissions. Amazonian trees hold vast stores of carbon dioxide and help stoke global warming when destroyed.      ILLEGAL LOGGING MAFIA In Brazil, prosecution of environmental crimes has weakened under President Dilma Rousseff, local NGO Imazon said, contributing to the first increase in deforestation in nearly a decade last year.Controls in Peru are even more lax, leading Brazilian loggers to cross the border to fell coveted woods like mahogany, said ProPurus.""The illegal logging mafia keeps growing,"" said Patricia Balbuena, a deputy minister tasked with protecting Peru's indigenous communities.Destruction of the Peruvian Amazon also picked up last year, a trend the country's agriculture ministry sees continuing until 2017.Brazil recently signed an agreement with Peru to bolster monitoring of the border region, but many believe more effort is needed.A tribe living in voluntary isolation in Brazil exchanged bananas with a group of settled Ashaninka in June, a rare effort at outreach anthropologists attributed to attacks from loggers or drug traffickers.Meanwhile, Indians are taking justice into their own hands.Earlier in the year, Reuters watched a group of some 70 armed Munduruku dismantle a wildcat mine in Brazil's Para state. Sebastian said the Ashaninka in Peru are now organizing self-defense patrols to purge encroachers from native villages with bows and arrows.""This will not remain unpunished,"" he said.

542,"   By Lawrence Hurley | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday handed a victory to employers over worker compensation, ruling that companies do not have to pay employees for the time they spend undergoing security checks at the end of their shifts in a case involving an Amazon.com Inc warehousing contractor.The court decided by a 9-0 vote that employees of Integrity Staffing Solutions facilities in Nevada, where Amazon merchandise is processed and shipped, cannot claim compensation for time spent undergoing screening - up to half an hour a day, according to the workers - aimed at protecting against theft.The ruling is likely to benefit other companies facing similar lawsuits including Amazon, CVS Health Corp and Apple Inc, according to Integrity's lawyers. The cases against Amazon, Integrity and other staffing companies affect up to 400,000 workers, with plaintiffs claiming hundreds of millions of dollars in damages, according to court filings.Amazon spokeswoman Kelly Cheeseman said the allegations in the Integrity case of a lengthy security screening process were ""simply not true."" She added that Amazon's screening process is  designed to take 90 seconds per employee at its facilities. Mark Thierman, an attorney for the plaintiffs, said the ruling leaves thousands of workers ""short-changed a half hour per day."" Many workers will still be able to pursue similar claims under state law, Thierman added.Justice Clarence Thomas wrote on behalf of the court that the screening process is not a ""principal activity"" of the workers' jobs under a law called the Fair Labor Standards Act and therefore is not subject to compensation. For workers to be paid, the activity in question must be ""an intrinsic element"" of the job and ""one with which the employee cannot dispense if he is to perform his principal activities,"" Thomas wrote.The high court reversed an April 2013 ruling by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which had found that the screenings were an integral part of the warehousing job done for the benefit of the employer and should be compensated.

548,"   By Devika  Krishna Kumar  Activist investor Starboard Value wants to merge office-supply chains Staples Inc (SPLS.O) and Office Depot Inc (ODP.O), CNBC reported, citing people familiar with the matter.Starboard, known for its aggressive shareholder activism, disclosed a 5.1 percent stake in Staples and boosted its holdings in Office Depot to nearly 10 percent, regulatory filings showed on Thursday. (1.usa.gov/1yU35DM)Shares of Staples, the No. 1 office supply chain, rose as much as 10.2 percent to touch a 52-week high of $16.32 in morning trading on Thursday. Office Depot's shares rose 14 percent to touch a four-year high of $7.74.Analysts have said a combination of the top two U.S. stationery retailers would help them fend off intense competition from online retailers such as Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and big-box chains such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) that sell the same merchandise for less.Fears of added antitrust scrutiny loom as Staples and Office Depot are the biggest remaining retailers of core office supplies, such as paper and ink toner.But some analysts said a deal could pass muster because of an increase in the number of companies offering the same products. Regulators nixed Staples' attempt to buy Office Depot 17 years ago, citing antitrust concerns.Starboard, which held an 8.6 percent stake in Office Depot as of Sept. 10, did not announce any plans for the companies in its regulatory filings on Thursday.It did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The hedge fund's stake in Staples is worth about $483 million, based on the company's closing price on Wednesday.Although some important questions such as antitrust remain, the downside to a merger seems ""very limited"", Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a note.The Federal Trade Commission approved Office Depot's $976 million acquisition of OfficeMax last year without the need to close stores, citing increased competition in the office supply industry.  A deal between Staples and Office Depot could be valued at $6 billion, or $11 per Office Depot share, if the rate of synergies was similar to the Office Depot-OfficeMax deal, Keybanc Capital Markets analyst Bradley Thomas said.New York-based Starboard has gained a reputation for aggressive shareholder activism since it was spun off from Cowen and Co's asset management business in 2011.Starboard, after a proxy contest last year, now has two nominees on Office Depot's 10-member board.Most recently, its push for change at Darden Restaurant Inc (DRI.N) led to a takeover of the Olive Garden owner's board.

Police said some employees were evacuated while arson and bomb squad teams, along with explosive detection dog teams, searched the area. Amazon did not return calls seeking comment.According to Seattle tech news site GeekWire, Amazon's Day 1 South building was closed because of the threat and some employees had returned home to work, citing sources close to the situation.Day 1 South is at the center of Amazon's headquarters in the South Lake Union neighborhood.

554,"   By David Ingram and Bill Rigby | NEW YORK/SEATTLE  NEW YORK/SEATTLE Corporate lobbyists, news organizations and academics joined forces with Microsoft Corp  on Monday in the software company's legal battle with the U.S. government over access to customer data stored overseas.The diverse set of interests filed briefs with a federal appeals court in New York, urging it to reverse a judge's order that Microsoft turn over emails from a data center in Ireland.

565,"  * Delivery delays in UK after ""Black Friday"" surge* Amazon workers strike in Germany* Fewer shoppers see e-commerce as most convenient* More stores introduce ""click and collect""By Emma Thomasson and Dominique VidalonBERLIN/PARIS, Dec 18 The Christmas rush is exposing the limitations of internet-only retailers as surging orders cause delivery delays, allowing Europe's shops to fight back with ""click and collect"" services and more in-store theatre.Online retailers such as Amazon have been winning market share from store groups for years, and there are few signs that Europeans are tiring of shopping from their computers and mobile phones.Researchers Mintel expect European online retail sales will rise 17 percent to 193 billion euros ($237 billion) this year, up from 15 percent in 2013 and far outpacing a sluggish broader industry.However, there is mounting evidence that a greater proportion of this growth is being captured by shops offering customers the option of picking up online orders in store, rather than internet-only sellers.Britain's biggest department store group John Lewis , which was early to integrate its store and e-commerce operations, saw online sales leap 42 percent in the so-called ""Black Friday"" week of pre-Christmas offers, helping it to record its highest ever sales week in its 150-year history.And Media-Saturn, Europe's biggest consumer electricals chain which has been losing market share to internet rivals for years, says it is now making up lost ground, with online sales surging 30 percent in the year ended September.""We do not see the peak for online sales, but stores are back,"" said Alexis Lecanuet, retail specialist at consultancy Accenture. ""We are seeing that the pure online experience is sometimes not the easiest or most convenient way to shop for customers, either for advice reasons, or availability reasons."" DELIVERY WORRIES Amazon is at the forefront of innovations by internet-only companies aimed at improving services, handling some deliveries itself and launching its own pick-up points, while working on expanding same-day delivery globally.But most pure online retailers are reliant on other postal services, and high-profile problems have stoked concerns among shoppers about whether they will get internet orders on time.British parcel carrier Yodel, which delivers some orders for Amazon as well as other chains such as Tesco, warned of delays last week after ""Black Friday"" and ""Cyber Monday"" deals resulted in volumes 26 percent higher than expected. In Germany, trade union Verdi has said it cannot rule out delays to Amazon deliveries after it called strikes at warehouses this week -- although the U.S. retailer promised parcels would arrive on time for Christmas.Concerns about delivery delays rank high among customers. An Accenture survey found that while 67 percent of Britons planned to do most of their Christmas shopping at online-only retailers, more than half were worried about receiving goods on time.That could start to curb enthusiasm for online shopping. Another Accenture survey this year found that 48 percent of consumers in mature markets ranked online shopping for convenience, down from 56 percent last year.Consultants PwC recorded a similar trend in France, with 43 percent of consumers saying they preferred to shop in stores, up from 35 percent in 2013.""The French are still very attached to the experience of going to a store, to be able to touch the product and have it right away. Some consumers also return to stores after a bad experience online,"" said PwC partner Sabine Durand-Hayes. STORES STRIKE BACK Meantime, many stores have made big improvements in handling online orders. Media-Saturn, owned by Metro, has just rolled out a same-day delivery service to 20 cities, allowing customers to pick up orders in store or use a courier. Up to 50 percent of its online orders are now collected in store.""If somebody wants a television to watch the football this evening, they can reserve it online and pick it up in the store within the hour. Nobody else can do that,"" said Metro Chief Executive Olaf Koch.Click-and-collect could make up 25 percent to 40 percent of UK online non-food sales this Christmas, according to Alex Smith-Bingham of consulting firm Capgemini.Christmas also provides an opportunity for shops to win customers back with in-store theatre, whether product demonstrations, tastings or visits to Santa's grotto.""Usually I buy a lot of electronics online, but for Christmas I like to go into the shop, for the atmosphere, and to try things out,"" said 20-year-old student Dennis Staatz, shopping on Berlin's Alexanderplatz.But there are still big challenges for store groups, not least in ensuring they get their own online businesses right.Marks & Spencer, Britain's biggest clothing retailer by sales, said last week it had been forced to extend delivery times for online orders as a new distribution centre has struggled to cope with heavy Christmas demand.($1 = 0.8137 euros)   (Editing by Mark Potter)",2014-12-18,AMZN,"Thu Dec 18, 2014 | 10:31am EST",Stores fight back as Christmas delivery delays hit e-tailers,http://www.reuters.com//article/europe-retail-internet-idUSL6N0TO3P420141218?type=companyNews

568,"  (Repeats story to widen distribution)By Deepa Seetharaman and Bill RigbySAN FRANCISCO/SEATTLE Dec 19 This spring, Taser International Inc won a small but high-profile contract to supply body cameras to the London police. But the deal nearly collapsed over one issue: where the video footage would be stored.In the end, the deal survived only after Taser dropped Amazon.com Inc as the data storage provider for the year-long project. The fact that Amazon did not have a data center in Britain was a deal breaker for British officials, according to Taser.The case is an example of the challenges that Amazon faces as it works to expand its cloud computing business, known as Amazon Web Services (AWS).

573,"   By Nandita Bose | CHICAGO  CHICAGO U.S. consumers have not turned out in force for the final shopping days before Christmas, suggesting that traditional retailers will just meet industry sales forecasts in a season marked by deep discounts and growing encroachment from online rivals led by Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O).Super Saturday - the last pre-Christmas Saturday, which fell on Dec. 20 this year - failed to make up for spotty performance this season. That included a disappointing Black Friday, the day after the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday that is typically one of the busiest shopping days of the year.""The past weekend will not save this holiday season,"" said Craig Johnson, president of the retail and consumer product-oriented private equity fund Customer Growth Partners. ""But combined with online sales, it would certainly save the year from being a dismal one.""     Johnson said if sales hold up in the next few days and the week after Christmas, retailers may finish close to his company's November and December forecast of 3.4 percent growth in store and online sales. He estimates that Super Saturday weekend sales, which include store and online, rose 2.5 percent to $42 billion this year.The National Retail Federation (NRF), the leading industry trade body, forecast a 4.1 percent rise in holiday sales this year, including online and store sales. The NRF is hoping to meet its expectations amid falling gasoline prices, lower U.S. unemployment and consumer spending which showed signs of increasing during the first two weeks of December.Promotions heated up in the past five days but that did not boost store traffic materially, said Keith Jelinek, senior managing director of FTI Consulting. Most retailers offered an additional 20 to 30 percent off on top of 30 to 40 percent discounts on a wide range of products, Reuters found during a series of visits to three dozen stores in Chicago over the weekend.  Best-sellers during the season included Apple Inc’s (AAPL.O) iPhone 6, toys based on the Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) animated movie ""Frozen,"" and winter clothing such as coats from retailers like Macy’s Inc (M.N) after a cold spell last month. Home appliances including mixers, coffee makers and food processors from chains like Home Depot Inc (HD.N), Lowe’s Companies Inc (LOW.N) JC Penney Co Inc (JCP.N) and Target Corp (TGT.N) were also particularly popular, industry-watchers said.WEAKER TRAFFIC  Super Saturday sales rose 0.5 percent to $9.15 billion from $9.1 billion a year ago, according to early estimates by ShopperTrak, which surveys spending at brick-and-mortar stores. This fell short of the firm's $10 billion sales forecast for the day, founder Bill Martin told Reuters. Analytics firm RetailNext, which tracks specialty stores and large footprint retailers, said sales dropped 8.9 percent over the weekend versus a year ago, and store traffic dipped 10.2 percent. However, customers who did hit the stores spent more. Specialty stores in the United States include chains like Best Buy Co Inc (BBY.N) and large footprint retailers include Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) and Target. ""Even with this drop in growth, Super Saturday was still better compared to Black Friday,"" said Shelley Kohan, vice president of retail consulting at RetailNext. ""It generated a tad more in terms of sales on slightly less traffic.""Promotions earlier in November took a toll on in-store sales during the Thanksgiving weekend, when total spending fell by 11 percent from a year earlier.  Highly discounted categories like consumer electronics and home improvement, which have had a strong season this year,  continued to do well on Super Saturday. The apparel segment, which has had one of its worst years, also picked up momentum, although not enough to offset slower growth in the past two months. Experts including Craig Johnson said the growth in apparel is occurring on the back of heavily discounted pricing, so margins this year will be weak in most of the category.FTI Consulting's Jelinek pointed to a jump in online shopping this past weekend which, he said, will bring relief to retailers with physical stores who also have an online presence.

576,"   By Malathi Nayak | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Google Inc's decision to screen Sony Pictures' film ""The Interview"" may help legitimize its YouTube platform as a serious rival to paid video streaming services, Netflix  and Amazon.com Inc.Sony Pictures made the controversial film available online on Wednesday, expanding distribution of a comedy that triggered a destructive cyberattack against the company that has been blamed on North Korea. The studio reversed its decision to halt the movie's release after it was criticized for self-censorship.""This is a huge opportunity for YouTube to show the world that it can be used to release professional content and content that is paid for as most people think YouTube is for free content,"" said James McQuivey, an analyst who covers the disruption of digital platforms at Forrester Research.""The message from YouTube is really to other studios, that 'Look, we're in the big time now, we can do this, we're not afraid (of hacks) and we have a massive audience.'""The release of ""The Interview,"" one of the highest-profile films to be released digitally on demand so far, comes at a pivotal time for the Internet search company. In recent years, YouTube has tried to leaven its image as an Internet repository of home-made videos and move toward more professionally produced content to expand its business. Last month, it launched YouTube Music Key, a paid ad-free service.YouTube does not disclose its content sales, but despite being one of the most heavily visited destinations for video on the Internet with over 1 billion viewers each month, analysts say YouTube has lagged the likes of Amazon, Netflix and Apple in paid content offerings.One risk for Google is that YouTube could become the target of Sony's hackers, though security analysts said the company is viewed to have strong cyber defenses.      Google has an ""enormous"" infrastructure that is well-tested in fighting off denial of service attacks and other threats,"" said Barrett Lyon, principal strategist with F5 Networks and an expert in Internet network security.  ""I wouldn't imagine seeing 'lights-out' out at YouTube."" The movie starring Seth Rogen and James Franco in a fictional plot to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong Un spurred the cyberattack against Sony Pictures.In addition to YouTube Movies, Google Play, and Microsoft's Xbox Video, the comedy will be available on a dedicated website, www.seetheinterview.com, to rent for $5.99 or buy for $14.99, Sony Pictures said on Wednesday, a day after agreeing to release it at some 200 independent theaters.

577,"   By Malathi Nayak | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Dec 24 Google Inc's  decision to screen Sony Pictures' film ""The Interview"" may help legitimize its YouTube platform as a serious rival to paid video streaming services, Netflix  and Amazon.com Inc .Sony Pictures made the controversial film available online on Wednesday, expanding distribution of a comedy that triggered a destructive cyberattack against the company that has been blamed on North Korea. The studio reversed its decision to halt the movie's release after it was criticized for self-censorship.""This is a huge opportunity for YouTube to show the world that it can be used to release professional content and content that is paid for as most people think YouTube is for free content,"" said James McQuivey, an analyst who covers the disruption of digital platforms at Forrester Research.""The message from YouTube is really to other studios, that 'Look, we're in the big time now, we can do this, we're not afraid (of hacks) and we have a massive audience.'""The release of ""The Interview,"" one of the highest-profile films to be released digitally on demand so far, comes at a pivotal time for the Internet search company. In recent years, YouTube has tried to leaven its image as an Internet repository of home-made videos and move toward more professionally produced content to expand its business. Last month, it launched YouTube Music Key, a paid ad-free service.YouTube does not disclose its content sales, but despite being one of the most heavily visited destinations for video on the Internet with over 1 billion viewers each month, analysts say YouTube has lagged the likes of Amazon, Netflix and Apple in paid content offerings.One risk for Google is that YouTube could become the target of Sony's hackers, though security analysts said the company is viewed to have strong cyber defenses. Google has an ""enormous"" infrastructure that is well-tested in fighting off denial of service attacks and other threats,"" said Barrett Lyon, principal strategist with F5 Networks and an expert in Internet network security.""I wouldn't imagine seeing 'lights-out' out at YouTube."" The movie starring Seth Rogen and James Franco in a fictional plot to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong Un spurred the cyberattack against Sony Pictures.In addition to YouTube Movies, Google Play, and Microsoft's Xbox Video, the comedy will be available on a dedicated website, www.seetheinterview.com, to rent for $5.99 or buy for $14.99, Sony Pictures said on Wednesday, a day after agreeing to release it at some 200 independent theaters. No cable or satellite TV operator has yet agreed to make ""The Interview"" available through video on demand (VOD).Apple's iTunes store was noticeably not on Sony's list.""If I were at Apple, I would think twice about re-inviting  hacking troubles, which is so embarrassing especially when you're about to get into personal health and Apple Pay.

585,"   By Deepa Seetharaman | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Amazon prides itself on being a company that breaks the rules, but its recent success in Hollywood also reflects an embrace of a more traditional, old-fashioned script.The largest U.S. online retailer, which has spent heavily on original programming and boosted the marketing for its shows, is up for two Golden Globe Awards this Sunday. Its Amazon Studios division, launched in 2010 with skepticism, is now starting to enjoy critical acclaim.The plan is raising its profile in Hollywood and, critically, among would-be members of its $99-a-year Prime program, which comes with two-day shipping on items sold on Amazon, streaming video and other perks.Also, like big studios in Hollywood, Amazon has courted big-name screenwriters and producers, such as Jill Soloway, a writer and co-executive producer on HBO's ""Six Feet Under."" She also is the creator of ""Transparent"", the Golden Globe television series nominee starring Jeffrey Tambor as a divorced parent who comes out as transgender to his three adult children.Amazon Studios, born as a rebel, promised to use its data-mining skills to birth mini-screen blockbusters, eschewing the longheld practices of Hollywood creative types. But its shows struggled to find an audience early on. Few consumers knew the largest U.S. online retailer, best known for low prices and fast shipping, was in the TV business unlike Netflix, which promoted its shows like ""House of Cards"" heavily.Since then, Amazon's marketing budget for original shows has expanded. In the fourth quarter, Amazon began promoting two of its original shows - ""Transparent"" and ""Mozart in the Jungle"" - with television ads and billboards, the more traditional marketing tools that it previously skipped. The changes do not amount to a wholesale shift in strategy for a company that relies heavily on mining customer data to inform its development team of potential television hits or misses. But they illustrate how Amazon is refining its approach to original scripted content, which is increasingly important to attracting new members to its Prime membership program.“We have gotten better over time about being quick and responsive and big and having the campaign roll-out effectively around the world in the UK, U.S. and Germany, where Prime exists,” said Roy Price, head of Amazon Studios.While the marketing campaigns are far from the full-page media spreads used by Netflix and Time Warner's HBO to promote shows, it has bought attention to Amazon’s fledgling foray into original content production, which is shown free to Prime members. USING NEW, OLD HOLLYWOOD MODELS  Amazon Studios started by focusing on building a software system where people could submit and share scripts, which are reviewed by Amazon readers and story analysts. But after the technology was in place, Amazon began to court professional writers, producers and directors to work on original content, Price said, allowing Amazon to tap new and old models.""As a practical matter, setting up the open system required some engineering and building, so we did that first. So once we launched that, we sort of set up the professional aspect as well,"" Price said. The vast majority of Amazon's television pilots now come from experienced and well-known names in the industry. The Golden Globe Awards nominations for “Transparent” for best TV comedy along with a best actor nod for Tambor are signs that the model is paying off. Another new Amazon show, “Mozart in the Jungle”, has also garnered strong reviews, landing on the New York Times’ list of Best Shows of 2014. Amazon spent an estimated $2 billion on content in 2014 with about $200 million of that used to develop original shows, according to Wedbush Securities analysts. Amazon spent more than $100 million developing original video content in the third quarter. As Amazon spends more on marketing, investors are concerned about its lack of profitability and skimpy disclosures regarding that spending. Analysts say it is unclear whether and when its efforts in original video content will bear fruit.Amazon is hoping the investments will help draw and retain paying subscribers to its Prime program. Prime members spend three times more on Amazon.com than other consumers, and they also spend more on Amazon over time, according to International Strategy and Investment Group analyst Greg Melich. Garry Trudeau, the creator and executive producer of “Alpha House” and Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist known for his Doonesbury comic strip, said that Amazon was betting on the long term, financially.

589,"   By Nichola Groom | BEVERLY HILLS, Calif.  BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. Two fresh new series, Showtime's ""The Affair"" and Amazon's ""Transparent,"" were catapulted into the spotlight on Sunday at Hollywood's Golden Globe awards, taking home the night's honors for best television drama and comedy.Amazon.com Inc's win for ""Transparent"" marked the first time an online streaming service took home a Golden Globe for best series. The show, about a transgender woman who comes out to her three adult children, won for best comedy series. Its star, Jeffrey Tambor, also took home a statue for best actor in a comedy series, giving Amazon wins in both of the categories for which it was nominated.""Transparent"" received wide critical acclaim for its handling of groundbreaking subject matter and has been a breakthrough series for Amazon, whose original programing had struggled to find an audience early on. Few consumers knew the largest U.S. online retailer was in the TV business. ""It was a huge risk,"" Jill Soloway, the creator of ""Transparent"" and the daughter of a transgender parent herself, told reporters backstage. ""The way Amazon is distributing it is transformative and the show is transformative.""""Transparent"" bested HBO's ""Girls"" and ""Silicon Valley"", The CW's ""Jane the Virgin"" and Netflix Inc's ""Orange is the New Black"" to win the top comedy series award. The winner for best drama series, ""The Affair"" tells the story of an affair between two married people told from the different perspectives of the man and the woman.It beat out four longer-running and well-loved series - ""Downton Abbey"", ""Game of Thrones"", ""The Good Wife"" and ""House of Cards"".""It does feel like a real whirlwind and it does feel like we just got on the air,"" the show's co-creator, Sarah Treem, said backstage at the awards show. Ruth Wilson, one of the stars of ""The Affair"", picked up the award for best actress in a drama series.Netflix, which is better known than Amazon for its original online programing, went into the night with seven nominations but picked up just one award - best actor in a drama series for actor Kevin Spacey, who plays a conniving Washington politician in ""House of Cards.""""This is just the beginning of my revenge,"" Spacey said onstage while accepting his award. The Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which hands out the Golden Globes, also honored new series ""Jane the Virgin"" and ""Fargo."" Gina Rodriguez won the best supporting actress in a comedy award for her role as a young Latina woman who is artificially inseminated by mistake in ""Jane the Virgin.""""This award is so much more than myself.

The show, about a transgender woman who comes out to her three adult children, won for best comedy series.Its star, Jeffrey Tambor, also took home a statue for best actor in a comedy series, giving Amazon wins in both of the categories for which it was nominated.""Transparent"" received wide critical acclaim for its handling of groundbreaking subject matter and has been a breakthrough series for Amazon, whose original programming had struggled to find an audience early on. Few consumers knew the largest U.S. online retailer was in the TV business.""It was a huge risk,"" Jill Soloway, the creator of ""Transparent"" and the daughter of a transgender parent herself, told reporters backstage. ""The way Amazon is distributing it is transformative and the show is transformative.""

""It does feel like a real whirlwind and it does feel like we just got on the air,"" the show's co-creator, Sarah Treem, said backstage at the awards show.Ruth Wilson, one of the stars of ""The Affair"", picked up the award for best actress in a drama series.Netflix, which is better known than Amazon for its original online programming, went into the night with seven nominations but picked up just one award - best actor in a drama series for actor Kevin Spacey, who plays a conniving Washington politician in ""House of Cards."" ""This is just the beginning of my revenge,"" Spacey said onstage while accepting his award.The Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which hands out the Golden Globes, also honored new series ""Jane the Virgin"" and ""Fargo.""Gina Rodriguez won the best supporting actress in a comedy award for her role as a young Latina woman who is artificially inseminated by mistake in ""Jane the Virgin.""""This award is so much more than myself.

597,"   By Deepa Seetharaman and Piya Sinha-Roy | SAN FRANCISCO/LOS ANGELES  SAN FRANCISCO/LOS ANGELES Jan 12 Amazon.com Inc's success at Sunday's Golden Globe Awards may help it win over two key audiences: Hollywood's A-list talent and the shopping customers the retailer wants to join its Prime membership program.""Transparent"", about a divorced parent who comes out as transgender to his three grown children, won a Golden Globe for best TV comedy while lead Jeffrey Tambor won for best actor. They are the first major wins for Amazon.""It gives Amazon a way to go to the TV industry and say 'you do a show with us, you can win awards too,' whereas it couldn't say that a week ago,"" said Eric Deggans, TV Critic at NPR.More importantly for Amazon, awards are a new calling card for Prime, its $99-a-year club known for two-day shipping, which the company sees key to growth.On Thursday, Amazon will unveil 13 new pilots for programs that, like Transparent, will only be available for free on Prime. In some cases, Amazon has pitched Prime primarily as a video service, a shift in marketing from the focus on shipping.In a September survey conducted by RBC Capital Markets, 10 percent of Prime members said unlimited instant streaming video was its most important feature, up from 7.9 percent in May 2013.Prime members spend three times more on Amazon.com than other consumers, according to International Strategy and Investment Group analyst Greg Melich. Michael Scanlon, who manages $3.5 billion at Manulife Asset Management and holds shares of Amazon, said drawing new Prime members was worth some video investment. ""Over time they should be able to get that paid back in pretty powerful way,"" he said.FINDING THE RIGHT MIX  The Amazon Studios division launched in 2010 and initially focused on shows from little-known writers that would then be streamed to Prime members for feedback. Amazon still streams the pilots to the public, but it has focused on hiring established talent, and Studios' chief Roy Price said the wins would reinforce the new focus on ""visionary artists"".The company also has ramped up its promotion of the new shows, addressing a lack of awareness on how exactly to watch its original content.That compares with an earlier approach. ""They said that they didn't believe in the normal patterns of advertising that would happen when on TV because they had a different experience as a retailer,"" said Michael Lehmann, executive producer on an early Amazon show ""Betas"", which was later canceled.During the last three months of the year, less than 40 percent of U.S. Prime members, or 14 million, watched at least one episode of ""Transparent,"" according to data from a Consumer Intelligence Research Partners survey.By contrast, 30 million Netflix members watched at least one episode of ""Orange is the New Black"" and 28 million subscribers of Time Warner's HBO Go reported watching at least one episode of ""Game of Thrones,"" said CIRP, which estimates that there are between 35 million and 40 million U.S. Prime subscriptions.

601,"   By Philip Blenkinsop | BRUSSELS  BRUSSELS Luxembourg took just two weeks to sign off a partly cosmetic deal that allowed Amazon (AMZN.O) to shift a large part of its European profits to an untaxed entity, according to EU antitrust regulators.The European Commission, which rules on competition and subsidies in the European Union, announced in October that it had opened an investigation into a tax ruling struck in 2003 and published details of its case on Friday.The investigation, one of a number into large international companies, focuses on whether Luxembourg broke EU state aid rules by allowing Amazon to operate almost tax-free in Europe.Such inquiries have raised questions for European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, former long-time prime minister of Luxembourg, over his role in the country's tax policies.The document released on Friday described the online retailer's structure, with a Luxembourg company functioning as the headquarters of its European operations and operator of all its European websites. The net turnover of that company, which it called LuxOpCo, was 13.6 billion euros ($15.8 billion) in 2013, about a fifth of worldwide sales of $74.5 billion.The Commission's inquiry centres on the relationship between LuxOpCo, pooling revenue from Amazon's EU websites, and Lux SCS, which received a royalty from LuxOpCo and was not subject to Luxembourg tax. The report said it had doubts whether the transfer pricing agreed by Luxembourg for Amazon reflected what a prudent independent operator would have accepted under normal market conditions.RAPID RULING The Commission further noted that the ruling requested by Amazon was assessed and accepted within just 11 working days. The presentation of the royalty payment, expressed as a percentage of revenue, seemed to be a ""cosmetic arrangement"".""It also follows from the above that Amazon has a financial incentive to exaggerate the amount of the royalty when applying the transfer pricing arrangement approved in the contested tax ruling,"" the document said.The tax ruling was still in force more than a decade later in 2014, the Commission's document said, far longer than rulings currently concluded by EU members.In that decade, Amazon's global business had grown explosively, with sales nearly 15 times higher than in 2003.

While modest compared with Hollywood blockbusters, the move will add to already hefty spending at Amazon, potentially unnerving investors concerned about the company's lack of profitability.Such films have proved challenging even for major Hollywood studios such as Paramount and Warner Brothers, which have bowed out of the business in recent years, said Jeff Bock, Box office analyst at Exhibitor Relations.""It's a tough, tough racket to play consistently,"" he said, pointing to the difficulty of getting good content and the competition for quality productions at festivals like Sundance. The move shows Amazon's growing ambitions in digital media, coming just days after the online retailer signed director Woody Allen to create a TV series and one of its existing series won a Golden Globe Award, a first for Internet TV services.Unlike rival Netflix Inc, a standalone Internet TV service, Amazon's Prime video service comes bundled with the Internet retailer's two-day delivery for items purchased on the site, which costs $99 a year, a key driver of revenue for the company.'SPECIALIZED FILM VIBE'  It remains unclear whether Amazon believes the movie business can make money on its own, but most of its other ventures are ultimately aimed at bolstering its underlying retail business.Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is known for his hunger to tackle new markets but the company has had a mixed track record, as with the recent Amazon Fire phone, whose price tag it has slashed after weak sales. Its movie-production gamble ups the ante for Netflix, which said in September it would jointly produce a sequel to ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" and in October signed a deal for comedian Adam Sandler to star in and produce four films to be shown exclusively on the service. Amazon said it has hired Ted Hope, a producer of independent movies including ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" and Academy Award-nominated ""Eat Drink Man Woman"", to spearhead the effort. “He’s very much tuned into the indie world and the specialized film vibe,"" said Paul Dergarabedian, an analyst at Rentrak.

625,"   By Deepa Seetharaman | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO After years of giving investors the cold shoulder, Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) is starting to warm up to Wall Street.The No. 1 U.S. online retailer was unusually forthcoming during its fourth-quarter earnings call on Thursday, saying it will break out results this year, for the first time, for its fast-growing cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services. The company also said it would focus on getting more out of its assets in 2015 and emphasized that it was already starting to reap benefits from investments in steaming video and logistics infrastructure.""The team ... is putting even more energy around making sure we get great productivity around our various fixed and variable investments,"" Chief Financial Officer Tom Szkutak told reporters on a conference call.This was a shift in tone for Amazon, which typically refuses to disclose more than the most basic details, including how many members belong to its $99-a-year Prime program or if its wide-ranging investments are paying off.Chief Executive Jeff Bezos has deflected criticism of his spending by emphasizing that he takes a much longer view than most investors. Late last year, he boasted that he spends just six hours a year on investor relations.But Amazon shares dropped by more than 20 percent last year as investors grew weary of its spending on film and television productions, grocery delivery and consumer devices. Amazon also has fallen short of estimates in five of the last eight quarters. The additional information shared during Amazon's fourth-quarter results as well as its emphasis on becoming more efficient signaled a new willingness by Amazon executives to listen to investors as well.""This quarter, Amazon flexed its muscles and said this is what we can do when we focus on profits,"" said Rob Plaza, senior equity analyst for Key Private Bank. ""If they could deliver that upper teens, low 20s revenue growth and be able to deliver profits on top of that, the stock is going to respond.""The change is unlikely to be dramatic. When asked whether this quarter marked a permanent shift in Amazon’s relationship with Wall Street, Plaza laughed: ""I wouldn't be chasing the stock here based on that."" Still, the shift is a good sign for investors, who have been clamoring for Amazon to disclose more about its fastest-growing and likely most profitable division that some analysts say accounts for 4 percent of total sales.The change seemed unlikely until AWS made up 10 percent of Amazon's net sales, the threshold at which U.S. securities regulators require disclosure. Szkutak also added that a large portion of Amazon's capital expenditure will go toward AWS, which has stepped up its efforts to win over lucrative contracts with large, corporate clients.""You should expect that we'll be spending more in terms of CapEx to support our web services business, which is growing very fast,"" he said on a separate call with analysts. ""You should expect us to add fulfillment capacity."" In a statement, Bezos also revealed that Prime memberships grew 53 percent worldwide in 2014, with international markets outpacing U.S. growth - the first time the company shared such figures. Amazon spent $1.3 billion on its video operation and billions on Prime shipping, Bezos said.Customers who tested Prime for streaming video were more likely to subscribe and stay longer than those who joined through other channels, Szkutak said.Amazon's spending on packing and shipping orders rose just 17.3 percent, nearly half the increase in the 2013 fourth quarter. Having more warehouses has helped lower transportation costs and Amazon is relying more on third-party sellers, which Plaza said generate three times the margin of direct Amazon sales.There was little discussion of consumer devices, like the Fire smartphone Amazon debuted last year to lackluster reviews. In the fourth quarter, Amazon worked through some of the $80 million in excess phone inventory it had at the end of September, Szkutak said.

628,"   By Noel Randewich | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Feb 3 Chip designer ARM Holdings Plc  on Tuesday unveiled a new processor blueprint with improved computing performance and beefed-up graphics aimed at smartphones and tablets to be launched next year.ARM's new Cortex-A72 processor design and related technology improvements come as the smartphone industry struggles with cooling demand after years of explosive growth sparked by Apple Inc's iPhone in 2007.Investors are concerned about lower royalty rates for ARM as growth in the smartphone market shifts to China, where consumers typically buy devices priced at $200 or less, compared with more than $600 in the United States.Rather than making its own chips, ARM licenses its processor technology to other semiconductor companies, including Qualcomm Inc and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, as well as to Apple. It receives royalties based on the selling prices of chips shipped by its partners. ARM's new processor has 3.5 times the performance of comparable chips from 2014, executives said at an event in San Francisco.The chip design will also deliver a 75 percent reduction in energy use, helping reduce battery drain on smartphones, they claimed. Some of the improvements will be due to advances in manufacturing technology at contract manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd, the Cambridge, U.K.-based company said.Nandan Nayampally, ARM's vice president of marketing, said with the Cortex-A72's increased computing horsepower, smartphones and tablets will be able to handle complex computing like voice analysis without having to connect to the Internet. Many compute-heavy tasks on smartphones today are handled  remotely in data centers owned by Internet heavyweights like Amazon.com Inc, Google  Inc and Facebook Inc  instead of by the smartphone's processor, with results instantly sent to the device.""There's more than enough performance on tap (for) increasing complexity on the local device,"" Nayampally said, adding that devices made with the new chip technology would likely ship in early 2016.Ten companies have licensed the new technology, including China's Rockchip and Taiwan's MediaTek Inc, ARM said.ARM shares were up 0.6 percent to $47.64 in Nasdaq trading.

629,"  (Adds Amazon.com considers buying some stores)Feb 2 Amazon.com Inc and Sprint Corp  are considering acquiring some RadioShack stores after the troubled electronics retailer files for bankruptcy, Bloomberg reported, citing people with knowledge of the discussions.Amazon has considered using the RadioShack stores as showcases for the Seattle-based company's hardware as well as potential pickup and drop-off centers for online customers, Bloomberg said. (bloom.bg/1D7QnUa)Sprint and RadioShack have had talks about co-branding some of the stores, Bloomberg reported, citing two anonymous sources. The rest of the stores would close down, Bloomberg reported on Monday. (bloom.bg/16aNrZw)The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), meanwhile, said its regulatory arm was acting to delist RadioShack shares, and would suspend their trading immediately. (bit.ly/1CrbPV5)Another bidder could yet emerge to buy RadioShack and continue operating the 94-year-old chain, Bloomberg said. RadioShack declined to comment on the Bloomberg report and said it had not confirmed any of the information. Sprint declined to comment. Amazon could not immediately be reached for comment outside regular U.S. business hours.The Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday that Standard General, a hedge fund and the largest investor in RadioShack,  was in talks to serve as the lead bidder at a bankruptcy auction.On Monday, the NYSE said it started the delisting process as RadioShack did not intend to submit a business plan to address its non-compliance with the exchange's listing standards. RadioShack had received a warning from the NYSE last month - the second time in a year - that it had 45 days to come up with a business plan.The exchange sends such a notification when companies listed on it fail to maintain an average market capitalization of $50 million over 30 consecutive days. RadioShack warned last September that it faced bankruptcy if talks with lenders and stakeholders about a sale or a restructuring failed.The electronics retailer was once the operator of go-to shops for innovators and engineers for products ranging from vacuum tube speakers to the first mass-produced PC.But the company has failed to transform itself into a destination for mobile phone buyers, losing out to rivals such Amazon.com Inc and Wal-Mart Stores Inc.RadioShack said in October that it would seek to convert a loan of $120 million, given by investors including Standard General and Litespeed Management LLC, into equity ""in the coming months"".RadioShack shares, which had touched a high of $79.50 in 1999 during the dotcom boom, closed down 13.3 percent at $0.24 on Monday.

631,"   By Deepa Seetharaman and Nick Carey | SAN FRANCISCO/CHICAGO  SAN FRANCISCO/CHICAGO Amazon.com Inc packages ordered by its Prime members regularly arrived late over the holidays, a Reuters/Ipsos survey shows, reflecting the strain on the logistics network that transformed the company into an e-commerce powerhouse.Customer satisfaction with Prime is extremely high - 96 percent are happy with its two-day shipping service, the survey revealed. But the results raise questions for Amazon as it expands and takes greater control of its shipping system. The $99-a-year service was launched a decade ago with the guarantee of standard, reliable two-day shipping on online orders. Prime has since become the cornerstone of Amazon's growth - and a testing ground for new services ranging from TV and video to delivery-by-drone.Amazon said U.S. Prime memberships increased 50 percent last year. Analysts reckon that the largest U.S. online retailer now promises standard two-day shipping to what amounts to nearly one-third of U.S. households.In the Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted last month, 10 percent of about 1,700 Amazon shoppers who chose the two-day shipping option said packages ordered between November 1 and December 31 did not arrive on the expected day.Greg Greeley, head of Prime, said the Reuters figures on delay sounded ""very suspect"" and that Amazon monitors the issue very closely.""Our internal data shows significantly better results,"" an Amazon spokeswoman added, without providing specific figures. ""But any miss is an error and we continue to work very hard to ensure fast, reliable and accurate delivery for customers."" The survey figures reflect the complexity and high cost of shipping orders from distribution centers to customer's homes -the so-called ""last mile."" ""As Amazon keeps raising the bar, it keeps raising the business risk for itself because the last mile is a messy place,"" said Bhaskar Chakravorti, senior associate dean for international business and finance at Tufts University's The Fletcher School. Satisfaction rates could erode if the late shipping problems continue, said Hayley Silver, a vice president at e-commerce researcher Bizrate Insights. “Some customers will remain Prime members because they love the other aspects Prime offers them. Some may not because on-time delivery was the most important thing to them,” she said. Others will simply order earlier, Silver added.SPEED MERCHANTS Amazon has increasingly tapped local and regional package delivery companies to cut costs and improve speeds. None of the firms Amazon lists as delivery partners on its website would comment for this article.This is the first time Reuters has conducted this survey so it's unclear how Amazon fared in the past. In addition, Reuters didn't compare delays at Amazon with other retailers. The Reuters/Ipsos survey had a credibility interval of plus or minus 1.4 percentage points.Amazon's net shipping costs as a percentage of revenue have remained relatively constant over the last several years, at about 4.7 percent. However, Amazon and other shippers continue to worry about rising costs. Early this month, United Parcel Service Inc said it would begin applying surcharges to deliver packages to homes. UPS, which reported that its earnings were hit by holiday shipping expenses, said its own cost to deliver a package to a residence are three times more than to a business. Guaranteed two-day shipping on items as low as a few dollars - such as $5.17 for a set of measuring spoons - costs Amazon big. Prime is also the vehicle for Amazon's other pricey ventures, including film and television production, same-day shipping and even one-hour delivery in New York.The challenge posed by Prime's growing popularity and scope has not gone unnoticed at Amazon, which is trying to speed deliveries and take more control of the process.One of Amazon's chief concerns is it doesn't have control of the entire delivery from warehouse to consumer, said former employees who spoke on condition of anonymity. For years, the company has been testing ways to take more control of the last mile, those ex-employees said. Those steps include building its own local delivery fleet and using the trucks designated for its Amazon Fresh grocery service to deliver orders.This mirrors what Amazon has already done in the United Kingdom.

633,"  (Adds details, background, shares)Feb 23 Target Corp halved the size of online orders eligible for free shipping to $25, undercutting Amazon.com Inc and traditional rival Wal-Mart Stores Inc as it focuses on its online business.Amazon offers free shipping on orders worth at least $35 and Walmart.com $50.Target said on Monday the new threshold comes into effect immediately. Shipping has become a key promotional tool in the escalating war between retailers, with companies increasingly offering free shipping throughout the year instead of just during the holiday shopping season.Target's digital offerings include Target.com and Cartwheel, a mobile app for coupons. Brick-and-mortar retailers are moving into online retailing, offering additional benefits such as in-store pickups.Online orders accounted for about 2.5 percent of total revenue of both Target and Wal-Mart in the year ended Jan. 31. This translates into about $1.83 billion for Target, based on the average analyst estimate for its total revenue, way below the $12.2 billion Wal-Mart reported for the period.Target said it planned to open two more distribution centers in the United States to support its online orders.Target's shares were little changed at $76.85 in late morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

637,"   By Sarah McBride and Dan Levine | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Feb 24 Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, the investment firm that has backed tech companies from Google to Amazon, will defend itself in court on Tuesday in a closely watched gender discrimination case that could lay open the inner workings of venture capital.Former Kleiner partner Ellen Pao accuses the firm of holding her back from a promotion and better compensation after she complained about harassment by a male partner. Kleiner has denied the accusations of discrimination and retaliation, and says Pao underperformed her peers. Both sides are expected to make opening statements on Tuesday in San Francisco Superior Court.The case helped spark a broad and ongoing discussion in Silicon Valley about sexism. Since Pao filed her suit in 2012, female employees at Pantheon Ventures Ltd and CMEA, two other venture firms, and a co-founder at Tinder filed similar suits that were later settled. Last month, a former girlfriend sued venture capitalist Joe Lonsdale for sexual assault and harassment. Lonsdale has denied those allegations and accused the woman of defamation.Many big technology firms have released statistics showing the percentage of their employees who are female hovers at around 30 percent. They blame in part a dearth of qualified women to hire, but many critics say the firms are not doing enough to attract and retain women. In her lawsuit Pao - now interim chief executive at social news service reddit - said her standing at Kleiner deteriorated after she ended a brief affair with another partner who has also since left the firm. Her career hit the slow track after he and the firm started retaliating against her, she said in court filings. Kleiner says Pao did not deserve a promotion and the better compensation that would have come with it. The firm says it has two senior women partners, more than most venture firms in Silicon Valley.Pao is seeking as much as $16 million from the firm, a lawyer for Kleiner Perkins has said. Kleiner could cite Pao's current compensation at reddit to rebut her claim that she missed out on income by not moving upward at the venture firm.The case is Pao v.

638,"   By Brenda Goh | SHANGHAI  SHANGHAI A Chinese government push to promote e-commerce has created a host of online retail rivals for Alibaba Group Holding Ltd and Amazon.com Inc catering to shoppers' fears about the quality and safety of local everyday goods.Encouraged by tax-relief programmes and other policies that gained traction last year, logistics firms including SF Express and state-owned Sinotrans are seeking to grab a piece of the cross-border e-commerce market which the government estimates to be worth $1 trillion by 2016.Smaller local internet firms like Netease Inc, which partnered last month with Sinotrans to set up an online bazaar, are also keen to gain from the sector known as ""haitao"", which roughly translates as ""seeking treasures abroad"".""Local e-commerce businesses aren't able to meet the needs of China's consumers who are increasingly buying from abroad,"" said Masa Ren, vice president of international e-commerce services at SF Express, one of China's biggest logistics firms.The company launched a portal in January selling lobster, milk powder and other items it sources from retailers in countries such as Canada and Japan. Since 2012, more than 2,000 firms have registered as cross-border e-commerce businesses, the customs bureau said.While Beijing's policies, aimed at reducing smuggling, have helped, the sector is booming thanks to the growing number of affluent Chinese who prefer global brands and whose faith in local goods has been frayed by a slew of safety scandals, mainly involving food.Advertising executive Fiona Chen says she buys most of her daily necessities from overseas, spending about $200 on items such as shoes and cosmetics online at least once a month. ""There are a lot of items that aren't available in China, and overseas products, particularly food, are safer,"" she said.Data from consultants iResearch estimates the gross merchandise value of cross-border e-commerce grew to 14.8 percent of China's total foreign trade last year from 11.9 percent in 2013. By 2017, the sector is expected to contribute about a fifth of total foreign trade, the consultancy said.Analysts say the smaller haitao players will find it difficult to grab business from giant Alibaba, which controls over 80 percent of all e-commerce in China and which is on a campaign to win U.S. business this year after launching Tmall Global in 2014. U.S. online retailer Amazon.com is also pushing ahead with expansion in China after it set up shop in Shanghai's free trade zone in AugustBut as these big firms go head to head with the minnows, the biggest winner of all may be foreign brands that are being offered a new route into China, said Scott Williams, vice president of programmes and services at the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai.

""It was my mistake. I cared more about her feelings than anything else. I thought it should be her choice"" whether to tell others at the firm and start an investigation, he said.Whether Kleiner reacted appropriately to allegations of sexism is at the heart of the suit, filed by former partner Ellen Pao.The case, brought in 2012, helped spark a broad and ongoing discussion about gender issues in Silicon Valley. In the suit, Pao alleges she suffered discrimination and retaliation after Nazre pressured her into a 2006 affair which she soon ended.     Pao alleged in her lawsuit that Lane and other partners did not initially respond to her complaints. Eventually, Lane told her to consider marriage to Nazre, she said in her suit. The discriminatory conduct spread to other partners, leading her to miss out on a key promotion, she alleges.Vassallo, who testified in the case last week, said Lane had told her to be ""flattered"" by Nazre's advances, although she later said she believed he was joking. But Kleiner did eventually start an investigation into Nazre's actions after she told more partners.The firm has vehemently denied Pao’s allegations. Kleiner’s lawyer, Lynne Hermle, said in court last week that the firm treated women fairly and did not promote Pao because she lacked talent.

649,"  * Q4 revenue $5.6 billion vs expected $5.3 billion* Expects Q1 revenue between 34.8 bln and 35.8 bln yuan* More than one-third of Q4 orders fulfilled by mobile   (Adds details)By Gerry ShihBEIJING, March 3 China's JD.com Inc, the biggest e-commerce rival to Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, posted a 73 percent rise in revenue for the three months through December, topping estimates as it expanded sales across more consumer goods categories.Revenue for JD.com's fourth quarter rose to $5.6 billion versus the $5.3 billion average estimate of 13 analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters. The Beijing-based company said on Tuesday it expected revenue of between 34.8 billion yuan and 35.8 billion in the first quarter of 2015.The company moved more goods than ever during the fourth quarter, which included the annual Chinese shopping extravaganza known as Singles Day, with gross merchandise value reaching 85.8 billion yuan, an increase of 119 percent.Excluding certain items such as stock-based compensation expenses, JD.com recorded a profit of 83.8 million, with a margin of 0.2 percent, in line with what executives had forecast. JD.com runs second place to Alibaba in China, with little love lost between the two companies' founders.Its business, like Amazon.com Inc's, is built on selling products it purchases through its own logistics network;  Alibaba by contrast has grown its business quickly by connecting sellers to buyers rather than stocking its own merchandise. JD.com, which has sought to differentiate itself by touting the authenticity of its products, said it is pushing into categories beyond its traditional stronghold of consumer electronics.

650,"   By John Ruwitch and Paul Carsten | HANGZHOU, China, March 4  HANGZHOU, China, March 4 Alibaba Group Holding Ltd is launching a cloud computing hub in Silicon Valley on Wednesday, the e-commerce giant's first outside of China, underscoring its global ambitions in the face of stiff and entrenched competition.The new California data center marks the Chinese company's latest measured expansion onto American soil, and into a hotly contested U.S. market now dominated by Amazon.com Inc, Microsoft Corp and Google Inc.Alibaba's Aliyun cloud division intends the new data center to cater initially to Chinese companies with operations in the United States, including retail, Internet and gaming firms. It will later target U.S. businesses seeking a presence in both countries, Ethan Yu, a vice president at Alibaba who runs the international cloud business, told Reuters.""This is a very strategic move for us,"" Yu said, declining to say how much Alibaba invested in the data center or disclose its location for security reasons. ""International expansion is actually a company strategy in the coming few years.""""Eventually we may expand to other regions, for example the East Coast or middle part of the U.S., if our customers have the demand for that.""Aliyun, which has been likened to a budding version of Amazon Web Services, began as part of the company's in-house technical infrastructure but has since expanded to lease processing and storage space for small and medium Internet businesses in China.While Alibaba dominates e-commerce in China, Aliyun, also known as Alibaba Cloud Computing, holds about a 23 percent market share in its home market. It faces both Chinese and foreign competitors, from carriers like China Telecom  to Microsoft and Amazon. Its existing data centers span the Chinese cities of Hangzhou, Qingdao, Beijing, Shenzhen and Hong Kong. Alibaba is kicking off its U.S. cloud business as American corporations and politicians are protesting what they see as Beijing's efforts to curb foreign technology at home.Chinese government controls have limited foreign competition and disrupted many online services, including Google's and Amazon Web Services', according to censorship watchdogs. This week, U.S. President Barack Obama sharply criticized Chinese regulations that subject overseas companies to arduous measures regarding data management.FIRST THINGS FIRST A more immediate concern may be how Alibaba intends to vie with the likes of Amazon, Microsoft and Google, which are slashing prices on cloud services to try and sustain double-digit growth. They're battling over a public cloud services market that could grow into an $100 billion industry by 2017, according to researcher IDC. U.S. customers are not expected to be bothered by the service's Chinese ownership if pricing is competitive.Alibaba has big plans for Aliyun, which now accounts for about 1 percent of its revenue but supports its core e-commerce operation and will also play a pivotal role in the long run. Alibaba sees cloud computing as key to its plans to aggregate and analyze the vast quantities of data it collects, including on consumer behavior.The company also needs to find ways to sustain so-far stunning growth. Shares in the company fell to their lowest levels since their debut on Tuesday, after rival JD.com's   better-than-expected quarterly results revived concerns that Alibaba's expansion is slowing. Cloud computing and infrastructure was the company's fastest-growing business segment in the December quarter, increasing sales 85 percent to $58 million.Alibaba now derives the vast majority of its revenue from China. In recent months it has made headway in emerging markets from Russia to Brazil, but the company has taken a cautious, calculated approach to the U.S. market.The northern California data node would serve internal Alibaba businesses, like AliExpress, its online B2C platform for buyers outside of China, as well as external public cloud clients, Yu said.He declined to disclose details about potential clients. But cash-strapped startups generally rely heavily on cloud service providers to power their services. Alibaba has invested in several U.S. firms including messaging app Tango, online retailers 11Main.com, Fanatics.com and Shoprunner, but it's unclear if they would avail themselves of Aliyun's services.Ahead of Wednesday's launch, Aliyun ran an invitation-only trial period for customers in China with international expansion plans, he said. The company began selling U.S. cloud services on Tuesday.""Gradually we will start to attract international customers,"" Yu said. ""There are actually lots of U.S. customers, U.S. enterprises who look forward to setting up lots of data centers in China to serve their Chinese-based customers.""""I do see there is big demand for U.S. customers who look for balanced presence of their IT infrastructure across the world, including China.""

652,"   By Matthias Inverardi and Nikola Rotscheroth | COLOGNE, Germany  COLOGNE, Germany Germany's second-biggest supermarket group REWE is investing heavily in grocery ecommerce even though it does not expect to turn a profit soon, as it braces for Amazon to expand its food delivery service.""We know that we will still not work profitably for several years, but it is not blowing money,"" REWE Chief Executive Alain Caparros told Reuters in an interview.""The customer is changing. They want to have it easy and we have to prepare ourselves for that. The online customer is our opportunity to become the number one in Germany. The train is leaving the station and I want to be on it.""REWE, a cooperative that runs 15,000 stores in 12 countries in Europe, is Germany's second-biggest supermarket group behind privately-owned Edeka and ahead of Metro and the Schwarz Group that owns the Lidl discount chain.While online sales of books, electronics and clothes are booming in Germany, grocery ecommerce has been slow to take off as the country has a high density of food stores and the dominant discounters Aldi and Lidl have little incentive to push loss-making deliveries given their already thin margins.However, big players such as REWE and Metro are now expanding delivery services, and start-ups funded by the likes of ecommerce group Rocket Internet are also proliferating. A survey by management consulting firm A.T. Kearney showed that 38 percent of Germans had tried online food retailing in 2014, up from 27 percent in 2013 and just 18 percent in 2011. A.T. Kearney expects ecommerce will account for 3 percent of Germany's grocery market by 2020 -- or some 5 billion euros  ($5.3 billion) -- up from just 1 percent now. Online already accounts for 5 percent of the grocery market in Britain, which has been a global trailblazer in food ecommerce.A.T. Kearney partner Mirko Warschun expects established retailers to capture much of this growth even if they have been slow to innovate in Germany in recent years. ""In food retail, the question of volume and scale advantage and negotiating power in category management and buying are decisive,"" he said. ""It will tend to be the traditional players who will want to tap the market for themselves.""REWE's Caparros said Amazon -- which already delivers groceries in a handful of U.S. cities -- had already secured logistics sites in Germany to expand its ""Fresh"" service to its second-biggest market after the United States.""When they come, they will come with a big bang,"" he said. Amazon has said it plans to keep expanding in Germany, including eventually delivering fresh groceries, without giving a timetable.Caparros said REWE now delivered groceries in 56 German cities and towns and was continuing to expand.REWE, which also runs the Penny discount chain and Toom DIY stores, saw sales grow 2.9 percent to 51 billion euros in 2013.

655,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Boeing Co (BA.N) on Monday said it could clinch a deal this year to build a high-throughput communications satellite for top technology companies such as Google Inc (GOOGL.O), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Facebook Inc (FB.O) or Apple Inc (AAPL.O).Jim Simpson, vice president of business development and chief strategist for Boeing Network and Space Systems, told Reuters the big technology firms were keen to expand Internet access around the world to help them grow. ""The real key to being able to do these type of things is ultra high-throughput capabilities, where we’re looking at providing gigabytes, terrabytes, petabytes of capability,"" Simpson told Reuters after a panel at the Satellite 2015 conference.Simpson declined to give specific details about discussions with the tech companies. He said the challenge was to drive down the cost of satellite communications to be more in line with terrestrial costs, which would help the tech firms justify the expense of building a larger communications satellite. But if sufficient demand failed to materialize, the tech companies would be left with the cost of ""a really high performance satellite,"" he said.Boeing and other satellite makers have been eying a new source of demand from technology firms such as Google and Amazon.com, given their interest in reaching the estimated 70 percent of the globe that still lacks access to the Internet. Privately held Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX, has said it plans to build a system of 4,000 satellites in low Earth orbit (LEO) for global Internet connectivity. In January, it received $1 billion in investments from Google and mutual-fund giant Fidelity Investments.Simpson noted that the Google investment was an equity stake in the company, not in the satellite project, but declined to say whether that meant Google could still be a possible customer for a higher-end Boeing system in geosynchronous Earth orbit (GEO).Mark Spiwak, president of Boeing Satellite Systems International, said he expected demand for GEO satellites to remain steady at about two dozen a year, but he said those satellites would clearly need to have greater processing power and larger bandwidth, given rising demand for global connectivity. He said GEO satellites were larger and more expensive, but they would save the cost of more frequent maintenance and launch costs for a large network of low-earth orbit satellites. At the same time, he said Boeing was also prepared to build LEO satellites, depending on customer preference.(Story refiles to correct typo in ""petabytes"" in 3rd paragraph) (Reporting by Andrea Shalal; Editing by Ken Wills)",2015-03-17,AMZN,"Tue Mar 17, 2015 | 9:18am EDT",Boeing eyes satellite deal with tech giant this year,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-boeing-satellites-idUSKBN0MD00T20150317?type=companyNews

We've moved on to more advanced designs that we already are testing abroad,"" said Paul Misener, Amazon.com's vice president for global public policy.""Nowhere outside of the United States have we been required to wait more than one or two months to begin testing,"" Misener testified before the Senate Subcommittee on Aviation Operations, Safety and Security.The Amazon.com case illustrates the frustrations of many industry representatives, who say the U.S. regulatory process is not keeping up with rapidly developing drone technology that could generate new revenues and cost savings for a range of industries.Ahead of Tuesday's hearing, the FAA sought to alleviate some of that frustration by announcing a new ""blanket"" approval that allows companies with exemptions from a U.S. ban on commercial drone use to fly limited operations without seeking new approval for each project.The change affects only flights of up to 200 feet (61 meters) during daylight hours and within a drone operator's line of sight. Seattle-based Amazon.com, the largest e-commerce company in the United States, wants to use drones to deliver packages to its customers over distances of 10 miles (16 km) or more, which would require drones to travel autonomously while equipped with technology to avoid collisions with other aircraft.Misener said European and other international authorities have more ""reasonable"" approaches that recognize the potential economic benefits of commercial drone operations.""This low level of government attention and slow pace are inadequate, especially compared to the regulatory efforts in other countries,"" Misener said, calling on regulators to begin planning now for drone systems capable of autonomous travel. Margaret Gilligan, FAA's associate administrator for aviation safety, defended the pace of FAA drone actions on safety grounds, saying U.S. airspace is more complex and more heavily traveled than that of other countries.  She told the Senate panel that regulators could set new standards for autonomous drone operations within a year. The FAA recently proposed rules that would lift the current ban on most commercial drone flights, but several restrictions attached would make package delivery and other business applications unfeasible.Among other constraints, the proposed rules would limit commercial drones to an altitude of 500 feet (150 metres), allow flights only during daytime and require operators to keep the aircraft in sight at all times.The agency does not expect to finalize the rules until late 2016 or early 2017, according to government officials. During this period, the current ban will stay in place; companies can apply for exemptions to use drones for specific business applications.  Gilligan said the FAA has granted more than 60 exemptions out of several hundred requests.   Meanwhile, Australia, Canada, France and the United Kingdom have progressed toward airspace integration and allow for commercial use, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) said in a report to the subcommittee. Australia has granted operating certificates to 185 businesses, while several European countries have granted licenses to more than 1,000 operators, according to the report.While the GAO said overseas restrictions are similar to those proposed by the FAA, it noted that France has begun to allow beyond-line-of-sight operations on a limited basis.

She told the Senate panel that regulators could set new standards for autonomous drone operations within a year.The FAA recently proposed rules that would lift the current ban on most commercial drone flights, but several restrictions attached would make package delivery and other business applications unfeasible. Among other constraints, the proposed rules would limit commercial drones to an altitude of 500 feet (150 metres), allow flights only during daytime and require operators to keep the aircraft in sight at all times.The agency does not expect to finalize the rules until late 2016 or early 2017, according to government officials. During this period, the current ban will stay in place; companies can apply for exemptions to use drones for specific business applications.Gilligan said the FAA has granted more than 60 exemptions out of several hundred requests.Meanwhile, Australia, Canada, France and the United Kingdom have progressed toward airspace integration and allow for commercial use, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) said in a report to the subcommittee.Australia has granted operating certificates to 185 businesses, while several European countries have granted licenses to more than 1,000 operators, according to the report.While the GAO said overseas restrictions are similar to those proposed by the FAA, it noted that France has begun to allow beyond-line-of-sight operations on a limited basis.

661,"   By David Morgan | WASHINGTON, March 24  WASHINGTON, March 24 E-commerce power Amazon.com  blasted federal regulators on Tuesday for being slow to approve commercial drone testing, saying the United States is falling behind other countries in the potentially lucrative area of unmanned aviation technology.Less than a week after the Federal Aviation Administration gave Amazon.com the green light to test a delivery drone outdoors, the company told U.S. lawmakers that the prototype drone had already become obsolete while the company waited more than six months for the agency's permission.""We don't test it anymore. We've moved on to more advanced designs that we already are testing abroad,"" said Paul Misener, Amazon.com's vice president for global public policy.""Nowhere outside of the United States have we been required to wait more than one or two months to begin testing,"" Misener said in written testimony submitted to the Senate Subcommittee on Aviation Operations, Safety and Security.Misener said Amazon had applied on Friday for permission to test a more advanced drone system and now hopes for quicker approval.The Amazon.com case illustrates the frustrations of many companies and industry lobbyists, who say the U.S. regulatory process is not keeping up with rapidly developing drone technology that could generate new revenues and cost savings for a range of industries. Misener, who was scheduled to join a witness panel at the subcommittee hearing, said European and other international authorities have more ""reasonable"" approaches that recognize the potential economic benefits of commercial drone operations.""This low level of government attention and slow pace are inadequate, especially compared to the regulatory efforts in other countries,"" Misener said.""The (FAA) already has adequate statutory authority. What the FAA needs is impetus, lest the United States fall further behind,"" he added.

During this period, the current ban will stay in place; companies can apply for exemptions to use drones for specific business applications.The FAA has been slow to grant exemptions, however, granting only 48 of several hundred requests.The Republican-led subcommittee called the hearing to examine the agency's efforts to integrate unmanned aircraft systems, or UAS, safely into U.S. airspace. Industry forecasters say that drones would generate nearly $14 billion of U.S. economic activity in the first three years of integration and $82 billion over a decade.Meanwhile, Australia, Canada, France and the United Kingdom have progressed toward airspace integration and allow for commercial use, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) said in a report to the subcommittee.Australia has granted operating certificates to 185 businesses, while several European countries have granted licenses to more than 1,000 operators, according to the report.While the GAO said overseas restrictions are similar to those proposed by the FAA, it noted that France has begun to allow beyond-line-of-sight operations on a limited basis.

665,"   By Nandita Bose | CHICAGO, March 30  CHICAGO, March 30 Amazon.com Inc is launching a home services marketplace that will connect customers with electricians, plumbers and painters in a move to have its services tied to every product sold on its website.Amazon Home Services, which will launch on Monday, will allow customers to buy 700 services such as car maintenance, TV wall-mounting and house cleaning at upfront prices. The quality of the service will be backed with an Amazon guarantee, which the retailer uses to vouch for products sold by third-party sellers on its website.A home services marketplace will extend Amazon's role as a middleman for third-party vendors, which account for about 40 percent of its sales. It would also help Amazon gain an edge in the fast-growing services industry in the U.S. which the retailer estimates to be around $630 billion. ""Third party estimates show that customers spend four times more on services each year than they do on physical products,"" Peter Faricy, vice-president, Amazon Marketplace told Reuters.""So for us the opportunity is very big,"" he said. Around 85 million Amazon shoppers buy products that require servicing or installation, the company said. Amazon will roll out the service nationwide with ""high coverage"" in Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles and New York.Services marks a new frontier for Amazon, which has focused on selling products as it expanded from books into consumer goods, groceries and media. Local services have been tough for marketplace companies to turn a profit, since offerings must be tailored to each city or region. Amazon will be in direct competition with Angie's List Inc , Craigslist Inc, and Yelp Inc as well as U.S. home improvement chains like Home Depot Inc and Lowe's Companies Inc, which have invested in ways to link customers with local plumbers, painters and other service providers.Amazon will hand pick service professionals after running background checks and offer to match prices if customers get a lower price for the same service and professional on another site, store or directly from the professional within 30 days of a purchase, Faricy said.Amazon Home Services will have a revenue share model with the service providers. The retailer will charge a 5 percent transaction fee, along with platform fees ranging from 10 percent for custom services and 15 percent for standardized services.

667,"   By Edwin Chan and Peter Henderson | SAN MATEO, Calif.  SAN MATEO, Calif. ShopRunner Inc, the e-commerce startup backed by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd that styles itself in some ways as the anti-Amazon, more than doubled its users over the past year and hopes to do so again in 2015, Shoprunner's chief executive said in an interview.The five-year old online retailer's gains may allow it to win over more customers who prize convenience and experience over cost savings, while taking advantage of its Alibaba relationship to help American retailers sell to China's still-growing middle class. ShopRunner borrows some of Amazon.com Inc's innovations: it charges $79 for two-day shipping to Amazon's $99. And it has an express checkout akin to its larger rival's one-click-buying feature.But CEO Scott Thompson says ShopRunner aims to be more like an online shopping mall that showcases brands than an Amazon or eBay marketplace where the focus is on lowest price.It also gives partners - ranging from Cole Haan and Under Armour to Neiman Marcus [NMRCUS.UL] - ownership of customer data and relationships.""These businesses spend a lot of money to do the right thing with their brands,"" Thompson told Reuters in an interview. ""I want the segment of customer who says I want to pay a fair price, but I want the experience to be predictable.""ShopRunner is one of a number of startups nibbling away at Amazon's dominance of the online arena. It remains to be seen whether any will make waves. The soon-to-be-launched Jet, for instance, is raising funds from investors at a rapid clip and hopes to carve out a niche in lowest-price shopping.ShopRunner membership is now at 2.4 million, though it is unclear how many of those users signed on through American Express Co, an investor in ShopRunner, which also offers its cardholders free membership. Beyond the numbers, Thompson says members are widening their spending - in much the same way shoppers patronize adjacent storefronts at the mall. Cross-shopping, when members who start out buying from one or two retailers evolve to shop from more and more, grew nearly 60 percent in 2014, from just under 20 percent previously.""It's that age-old tenant in the mall that draws customers in, and people around it benefit from the traffic,"" Thompson said. Over the longer term, Thompson hopes to take greater advantage of ties to Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce titan that paid $202 million for 39 percent of the company in 2013.ShopRunner is one of several U.S. e-commerce companies working with Alibaba and affiliate Alipay to help U.S. retailers access China.Through Alipay's nascent ""ePass"" service, which aims to let Chinese customers buy and pay for goods from U.S. retailers hassle-free, ShopRunner helps Neiman Marcus and Cole Haan sell to consumers in China by marketing their brands to buyers there.As Alibaba's biggest single U.S. e-commerce investment, ShopRunner will play a key role in Alipay's effort, although it also has relationships with sites in which Alibaba has no equity holding. Thompson wouldn't give specifics but said ShopRunner's own four-month effort to sell through Alipay was going well and demonstrated the vast potential of a market in which retailers like Best Buy have made little headway despite years of effort.There's some evidence Alibaba's program is taking off. Gilt.com has seen a doubling in sales to China since it started working with Alibaba and Alipay.And iHerb, a little-known purveyor of vitamins and health supplements, has seen sales surge 693 percent in the first six months, Alipay Americas president Jingming Li told a conference in San Francisco on Wednesday.""This will be, over a three year period, equally as big a business and equally as compelling,"" Thompson said.""It's still early. The opportunity is just too big to miss getting this one right.""

It will launch from Blue Origin’s west Texas facility near Van Horn, Texas, southeast of El Paso.Testing and development of the rocket engine, called BE-3, has been completed, the last major milestone before the liquid oxygen- and liquid hydrogen-fueled motor is attached to the New Shepard capsule for flight, Blue Origin President Rob Meyerson told reporters on a conference call.Privately owned Blue Origin has not started selling tickets for flights on New Shepard or released pricing information. “The engine is ready for flight ... and ready for other commercial users,” Meyerson said. He declined to be more specific about when New Shepard would fly, except to say “soon.”The capsule will fly dozens of times unmanned before the test flights include pilots, Meyerson added.Blue Origin is among a handful of companies planning to offer commercial spaceflight services. New Shepard is a suborbital system, like Virgin Galactic’s SpaceShipTwo, a six-passenger, two-pilot space plane that is expected to resume test flights later this year following a fatal accident in Mojave, California, on Oct. 31, 2014. Another company, privately owned XCOR Aerospace, is working on a two-seater space plane called Lynx that also is slated to debut this year, founder and chief technology officer Jeff Greason said.Other companies, including Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX, and Boeing, are skipping suborbital spaceflight and developing systems to carry people into orbit. Blue Origin intends to parlay its suborbital New Shepard vehicle into an orbital launch system, expected to begin flying later this decade. That vehicle will be powered by a liquefied natural gas motor, called the BE-4, that is being developed with United Launch Alliance, a partnership of Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing.The recently completed BE-3 engine also will be modified to serve as an upper-stage motor to fly satellites into orbit, Meyerson said.

It has recently set up operations in Belarus, Ukraine, Lebanon and Brunei.The company is made up of five regional fashion companies - Dafiti, Lamoda, Jabong, Zalora and Namshi, each established brands in their regions and run by their own management teams. GFG said former Amazon France President Romain Voog, 43, will become the chief executive, and Nils Chrestin, 34, will serve as its chief financial officer in January.The company, which is to be based in London, operates online fashion sites in countries which typically lack reliable transport delivery networks on which modern e-commerce depends. It overcomes this by creating its own transport networks -- branded vans and motorcycle drivers deliver online purchases to customers, who typically pay cash on demand. They also handle returns, and act as mobile advertising for the service.GFG has 9,500 employees, roughly 40 percent of whom are in fulfilment - delivery, warehousing or stock-picking functions. It outsources some delivery operations where local services are available, but considers its physical delivery network a key strategy for connecting to its customers. ""Owning that last-mile delivery is a part of our strategy,"" Chrestin said in a phone interview of the investment required. ""This will always be a very fundamental part of how we do things.""Chrestin has spent the last two years as managing director and chief financial officer of Lamoda in Moscow prior to becoming GFG's CFO in January.

672,"   By Jonathan Stempel | April 9  April 9 Amazon.com Inc has sued four websites to stop them from selling fake, positive product reviews.In a complaint filed on Wednesday in King County Superior Court in Washington, Amazon said the bogus reviews undermine a system that the Seattle-based online retailer launched 20 years ago to help shoppers using its website decide what to buy.Four- and five-star reviews can aid sales, especially if customers perceive them as unbiased.But Amazon said the defendants are misleading customers, and through their activity generating improper profit for themselves and a ""handful"" of dishonest sellers and manufacturers. ""While small in number, these reviews threaten to undermine the trust that customers, and the vast majority of sellers and manufacturers, place in Amazon, thereby tarnishing Amazon's brand,"" the complaint said.The defendants include Jay Gentile, a California man who allegedly runs buyazonreviews.com, as well as unnamed operators of buyamazonreviews.com, bayreviews.net and buyreviewsnow.com, according to the complaint. Amazon said the defendants have caused reviews to be posted on its website intermittently, through a ""slow drip"" designed to evade its detection systems, at a typical cost of $19 to $22 per review.The defendants did not immediately respond on Thursday to requests for comment or could not immediately be reached. Amazon's lawsuit accuses the various defendants of trademark infringement, and violations of federal anti-cybersquatting and Washington consumer protection laws.It seeks a halt to the alleged fake reviews and improper use of the Amazon name, as well as compensatory and triple damages.Yelp Inc, which lets consumers post reviews to its website, on Feb. 13 sued yelpdirector.com's alleged operators, accusing them of trying to help businesses through posting positive reviews and suppressing bad reviews.

674,"  Amazon.com Inc has won approval from U.S. federal regulators to test a delivery drone outdoors, less than a month after the e-commerce powerhouse blasted regulators for being slow to approve commercial drone testing.The Federal Aviation Administration had earlier given the green light to an Amazon prototype drone in March, but the company told U.S. lawmakers less than a week later that the prototype had already become obsolete while it waited more than six months for the agency's permission.The FAA granted Amazon's request to test delivery drones in a letter dated Wednesday, posted on the agency's website.  Amazon must keep flights at an altitude of no more than 400 feet (120 meters) and no faster than 100 miles per hour (160 km per hour), according to the letter. Seattle-based Amazon.com has been pursuing its goal of sending packages to customers by air, using small, self-piloted aircraft, even as it faces public concern about safety and privacy.The company wants to use drones to deliver packages to its customers over distances of 10 miles (16 km) or more, which would require drones to travel autonomously while equipped with technology to avoid collisions with other aircraft.

687,"   By David Randall | NEW YORK  NEW YORK For many years, investors have been very tolerant as Amazon.com has sacrificed profits for rapid growth in sales and as it built new businesses. That patience may finally be wearing thin.The average large-cap fund that holds Amazon has 1.4 percent of its assets in the stock, down 23 percent from this time last year, according to the latest available Lipper data. There are 116 funds with more than $1 billion under management that have either reduced or sold all of their holdings in the Internet retailer over the past 12 months. They include such well-known names as Fidelity Contrafund, Washington Mutual Investors Fund, Touchstone Sands Select Growth fund and the T. Rowe Price Growth fund. A total of 140 funds added to their position and four funds maintained the number of shares they owned at the same level. Some investors and analysts said that a drop in aggregate fund ownership - in a period when Amazon's shares have been climbing - suggests that large-cap managers increasingly see the company as over-valued, particularly at a time when it is spending tons of cash branching off into everything from selling its own smartphone to producing a Woody Allen TV series.Reuters contacted the 25 mutual fund managers who sold the greatest number of Amazon shares over the last year, and none of them were willing to be quoted by name for this story.One fund manager who sold out of his position in the company over the last six months said: ""This has the potential to be a phenomenally profitable company, but the shares are rallying on no new news, in our opinion, so we thought we might as well step to the side for a while.”  This is not the first time that investors have bemoaned Amazon's predilection for plowing money back into expanding the company's reach rather than realizing it as profit. Jeff Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon, has long said that he is more interested in satisfying customers to earn their long-term business than in short-term earnings measures and has never set a date by which the company expects to turn a consistent profit.The company did not respond to a request for comment for this story.VALUATION GAP  What strikes some investors as different this time around is the widening divergence between Amazon's valuation and that of its large technology peers like Apple Inc and Google Inc, both of which are growing at similar rates.  Amazon trades at 16.2 times its book value. Apple, by comparison, trades at 6.5 times its book value, according to Thomson Reuters data. Google, another company which has expanded beyond its core business into lines as far afield as driverless cars, is valued at 3.4 times its book value. The others made big profits last year while Amazon was unprofitable.While Google has posted more than $68 billion in profits before taxes between 2010-2014, Amazon has netted just $2.6 billion over the same time frame, according to Thomson Reuters data. The cashflow is a better gauge of how the company is doing, according to Robert S. Peck, an analyst at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, who downgraded the company to ""neutral"" on March 9 because he views the shares as  overvalued. He estimates its free cash flow from operations will climb to $8.9 billion this fiscal year from $3.4 billion in 2010, yet nearly all of that additional cash is being used to expand into businesses like grocery delivery or web services.The company's shares have rallied nearly 26 percent for the year to date after its fourth quarter results beat Wall Street estimates. Sales continue to grow at an above-market pace, with analysts expecting it to post 13.7 percent revenue growth in the first quarter of 2015 when it reports results on Thursday. Its share price is up approximately 167 percent over the past five years, nearly 90 percentage points more than the benchmark Standard & Poor's 500 index's gain. The stock trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 414, based on 2015 earnings estimates, against 17.1 for the S&P 500, according to StarMine data. Overall, Wall Street seems to be giving the company time. ""Management has earned the benefit of the doubt,"" said Mark Oelschlager, co-portfolio manager of the White Oak Select Growth fund who has owned the stock for the last 8 years. ""Their core retail business remains to us the jewel of the company, and they have this huge platform that would be difficult for any competitor to replace."" Just 2 of the 45 analysts tracked by Reuters who cover the company have a sell rating on its shares, while 27 recommend that clients actively buy shares. ""The market overall is in a bull market and it's giving this company a pass,"" said Chaim Siegel, an analyst at Elazar Advisors who downgraded the company to the equivalent of ""sell"" on April 2. While high now, the company's shares will likely plunge at any sign that the market's overall direction is turning negative, he added. Bill Smead, portfolio manager of the $1.1 billion Smead Value fund, said he does not own shares of Amazon despite his fund's overall bet that consumer spending will climb. Ironically, that is because he expects the company's shares to tumble once it finally does show consistent profits - a sign that its growth days are over.""As long as it’s a spectacular sales growth story they're fine, but as soon as they actually generate earnings their valuation is going to be based on that"" rather than investor's trust in Amazon's strategy, he said. ""That's when your mortality kicks into gear.""   (Reporting by David Randall; Editing by Linda Stern and Martin Howell)",2015-04-23,AMZN,"Thu Apr 23, 2015 | 1:12pm EDT","As Amazon parties on, some large fund managers take their leave",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-amazon-valuatoin-idUSKBN0NE01M20150423?type=companyNews

689,"   By David Randall | NEW YORK, April 22  NEW YORK, April 22 For many years, investors have been very tolerant as Amazon.com has sacrificed profits for rapid growth in sales and as it built new businesses. That patience may finally be wearing thin.The average large-cap fund that holds Amazon has 1.4 percent of its assets in the stock, down 23 percent from this time last year, according to the latest available Lipper data.There are 116 funds with more than $1 billion under management that have either reduced or sold all of their holdings in the Internet retailer over the past 12 months. They include such well-known names as Fidelity Contrafund, Washington Mutual Investors Fund, Touchstone Sands Select Growth fund and the T. Rowe Price Growth fund.Some investors and analysts said that such a drop in fund ownership - in a period when Amazon's shares have been climbing - suggests that large-cap managers increasingly see the company as over-valued, particularly at a time when it is spending tons of cash branching off into everything from selling its own smartphone to producing a Woody Allen TV series.Reuters contacted the 25 mutual fund managers who sold the greatest number of Amazon shares over the last year, and none of them were willing to be quoted by name for this story. One fund manager who sold out of his position in the company over the last six months said: ""This has the potential to be a phenomenally profitable company, but the shares are rallying on no new news, in our opinion, so we thought we might as well step to the side for a while.""This is not the first time that investors have bemoaned Amazon's predilection for plowing money back into expanding the company's reach rather than realizing it as profit. Jeff Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon, has long said that he is more interested in satisfying customers to earn their long-term business than in short-term earnings measures and has never set a date by which the company expects to turn a consistent profit.The company did not respond to a request for comment for this story. VALUATION GAP What strikes some investors as different this time around is the widening divergence between Amazon's valuation and that of its large technology peers like Apple Inc and Google Inc, both of which are growing at similar rates.Amazon trades at 16.2 times its book value. Apple, by comparison, trades at 6.5 times its book value, according to Thomson Reuters data. Google, another company which has expanded beyond its core business into lines as far afield as driverless cars, is valued at 3.4 times its book value. The others made big profits last year while Amazon was unprofitable.While Google has posted more than $68 billion in profits before taxes between 2010-2014, Amazon has netted just $2.6 billion over the same time frame, according to Thomson Reuters data. The cashflow is a better gauge of how the company is doing, according to Robert S. Peck, an analyst at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, who downgraded the company to ""neutral"" on March 9 because he views the shares as  overvalued. He estimates its free cash flow from operations will climb to $8.9 billion this fiscal year from $3.4 billion in 2010, yet nearly all of that additional cash is being used to expand into businesses like grocery delivery or web services.The company's shares have rallied nearly 26 percent for the year to date after its fourth quarter results beat Wall Street estimates.

698,"   By Nandita Bose and Lehar Maan  Amazon.com Inc's first-quarter revenue grew more than expected as rising sales in North America and its burgeoning cloud-computing services unit offset new business investments, boosting its shares nearly 7 percent.The e-commerce company for the first time broke out financial details of its secretive cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services, on Thursday, saying revenue jumped almost 50 percent to $1.57 billion, or about 7 percent of total revenue.The unit's operating income grew 8 percent to $265 million.Amazon shares rose $26.01 to $416 in extended trading, after closing slightly higher at $389.99 on Nasdaq.Chief Executive Jeff Bezos revealed in a statement that Amazon Web Services is a $5 billion business and its growth is accelerating.""We're putting a lot of capex (capital expenditure) there, and we think over time we will be able to generate significant free cash flow,"" Chief Financial Officer Tom Szkutak said on a conference call.Cloud computing has turned out to be more lucrative than expected, Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter noted. ""Amazon's Web service is profitable, and apparently was a year ago as well. Everybody thought it was losing money ... and is probably a bit smaller than people thought it was."" Amazon's sales from North America rose 24 percent to $13.4 billion in the quarter ended March 31, the company said.The company said it is continuing to build its Prime delivery business with its one-hour delivery service called Prime Now. It is also investing in original content for its Prime instant video services and devices.The international unit, which accounts for about 35 percent of total sales, remained a drag, with sales for the quarter slipping 1.77 percent to $7.75 billion.Szkutak said Amazon has stepped up its investments, particularly in India, and remains selective in China. ""The growth rate in India is very rapid,"" he said. ""A big part of the challenge there is helping sellers to succeed and grow their online businesses.""     Amazon said it expected net sales to grow 7 to 18 percent in the current quarter to $20.6 billion to $22.8 billion. It estimated an operating loss of $500 million to an operating income of $50 million for the quarter.Analysts on average were expecting second-quarter revenue of $22.11 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Amazon reported a loss of $57 million, or 12 cents per share, for the first quarter compared with a profit of $108 million, or 23 cents per share, a year earlier as it continued investing in products and services that ranged from Hollywood-style television productions to drone delivery and streaming video-calls. Revenue rose 15 percent to $22.7 billion in the first quarter.Analysts on average had expected a loss of 12 cents per share on revenue of $22.39 billion.

699,"   By Bill Rigby and Nandita Bose | SAN FRANCISCO/CHICAGO  SAN FRANCISCO/CHICAGO Amazon.com Inc surprised investors on Thursday by disclosing for the first time that it makes a profit from its fast-growing cloud-computing business. Microsoft, its closest rival in that arena, also touted a fast-growing cloud business, but held back on key numbers, leaving investors with as many questions as answers. Analysts honed in on Azure, Microsoft's cloud-computing platform, in a conference call on Thursday after earnings, but Microsoft executives avoided specific answers. ""The lack of disclosure on Azure profitability is conspicuous by its absence,"" said Todd Lowenstein, a portfolio manager at HighMark Capital. Amazon's disclosures ""will put pressure on Microsoft to disclose more and lift up the kimono."" Amazon said on Thursday its Amazon Web Services operation - which sells computing power, storage and other services on its own servers - took in $1.57 billion in revenue in the quarter and profit of $265 million, indicating a 17 percent operating profit margin, above most investors' assumptions.Microsoft said only that revenue from Azure - which provides similar services to AWS but is also a much broader platform - was growing. It did say that total commercial cloud revenue, which includes online versions of its Office and Dynamics applications, more than doubled, and is now running at a rate of $6.3 billion in revenue per year.  One analyst asked Microsoft Chief Executive Satya Nadella if Amazon's cloud profitability set a benchmark for Microsoft, but he did not bite. ""I don't think the comparison between Azure and AWS is true for me,"" said Nadella. He suggested that Azure's broader range of services meant the margins on Microsoft's cloud business were more of a mix, without giving any specifics.  Microsoft may have more time than Amazon to show a profit from the cloud, given that the world's largest software company is already highly profitable from its traditional lines of business. Amazon, which only fitfully yields an overall profit from its massive online retail business, has been under much greater scrutiny to provide details on its cloud unit.""There was more pressure for Amazon to do that versus Microsoft, given their model,"" said Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets. ""The Street is laser-focused on top-line growth for the coming year and for Nadella the focus should be on cloud growth and Windows 10.""

700,"  * Further gains in biotech, social media seen limited* Investors view cyber security, cloud services as growth areasBy David RandallNEW YORK, April 27 When the Nasdaq Composite last hit record highs during the dotcom era, fund manager Walter Price struggled with justifying paying 400 times a company's earnings for rapid growth.Now, with the Nasdaq setting new closing records for the first time in 15 years (although it is still short of its all-time intraday high), valuations are a sliver of what they were during the last boom. Instead, Price worries that the companies that have powered the 25 percent rally in the Nasdaq over the last year are likely to plateau.""What brought us here isn't likely going to keep pushing us forward,"" said Price, lead portfolio manager of the Wells Fargo Advantage Specialized Technology fund. ""We have a large position in Apple, but to say that Apple is going to double from here is not realistic.""It is a concern of other top technology fund managers, as well. With the Nasdaq Biotechnology index up more than 60 percent over the last 12 months and social media companies such as Facebook jumping 50 percent over the same time, the gains in both of these sectors will likely be muted in the year ahead, fund managers say. Instead, they are looking to what they see as the largest growth areas over the next three years: cyber security, cloud services and electronic payments.Price, for instance, has been cutting his position in Facebook and adding to cloud computing companies such as Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp and payments company Visa Inc. He also remains bullish on Amazon.com Inc, which posted operating margins of 16.9 percent last quarter in its Amazon Web Services cloud computing division.""That's worth the value of Amazon today,"" given the potential for growth in the cloud business, he said. ""To me, you are getting all the retail business for free."" Sandy Villere, co-portfolio manager of the Villere Balanced Fund, boosted the overall level of technology stocks in his portfolio by 17 percent, the greatest increase among funds tracked by Lipper. Most of that went into adding to and buying so-called back office technology companies such as DST Systems Inc, which specializes in data management in the insurance, healthcare and financial services industries.""I don't think the Nasdaq is overvalued at this point. I'm just looking for tech companies that dominate a niche, and this niche is growing,"" he said.There are few signs that fund managers as a whole are overly bullish on technology, even as the Nasdaq posts records. The average fund has 17.7 percent of its assets in technology companies, roughly matching the average of 17.8 percent invested in the sector in 2010, according to Lipper data. The benchmark S&P 500 index, by comparison, has a 19.7 percent weighting in technology, its largest sector. Even fund managers who pride themselves on making out-of-favor bets say there are still opportunities in biotech despite its rally.Daniel Kozlowski, portfolio manager of the $4.6 billion Janus Contrarian Fund, added a position in animal health company Zoetis Inc, a spinoff of Pfizer Inc , in the fourth quarter. Yet he's also adding to little-followed hardware companies such as Knowles Corp, which makes microphones used in the iPhone.""We're only interested in special situations, such as spinoffs, in biotech because so much of that market is so expensive. We prefer instead to go places where there's little interest and be in early and get out early,"" Kozlowski said.Skip Aylesworth, portfolio manager of the Hennessy Technology fund, said that he now has been reducing his position in biotech companies such as Gilead Sciences Inc  and moving more money to cyber security companies, which now take up approximately 10 percent of his portfolio. As more companies move key parts of their businesses to the cloud, the importance of protecting data will only grow, he said.""The development of these companies is not driven quarter-by-quarter,"" he said. This is a trend that's going to play out for at least the next three years.""(Reporting by David Randall; editing by Linda Stern and Nick Zieminski)",2015-04-27,AMZN,"Mon Apr 27, 2015 | 1:22pm EDT","With Nasdaq at records, investors ask what's next for tech",http://www.reuters.com//article/nasdaq-funds-idUSL1N0XO16020150427?type=companyNews

704,"   By Nandita Bose and Kshitiz Goliya  Groupon Inc (GRPN.O) forecast full-year revenue well below analyst expectations on Tuesday, hurt by a stronger dollar and weaker-than-expected billings, a key metric reflecting the gross amount collected from customers.Groupon, which once dominated the fast-growing online coupons arena, has been struggling to rev up sales and profit as it battles stiff competition from smaller companies as well as online giants such as Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and Google Inc (GOOGL.O).In April, the company agreed to sell a 46 percent stake in its South Korean business as part of its turnaround efforts.Chief Executive Eric Lefkofsky told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday the company will evaluate alternatives that would help unlock shareholder value in countries where Groupon questions its long-term strategic positioning, as it did in Korea.""(We) will.. allocate time and resources in countries and businesses where we think we can win,"" he saidThe daily deals and online retailer, which gets 160 million visitors globally per month, saw a drop in active customers to 48 million as of March 31 from 54 million as of Dec. 31, 2014, due to the stake sale in Korea and seasonality factors. Lefkofsky said the company aims to double the number of deals over the next year so that Groupon always has deals on offer within its top categories.Groupon forecast 2015 revenue of between $3.15 billion and $3.3 billion, below the $3.53 billion analysts on average were expecting, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.The company, which got about 36 percent of total revenue from outside North America in the first quarter, said it expected changes in foreign exchange rates to hurt its year-over-year revenue growth rate by 700 basis points. Groupon reported gross billings of $1.55 billion for the first quarter, well below the average analyst estimate of $1.86 billion, according to market research firm FactSet StreetAccount.The company expects to sustain low to mid double-digit growth in its North America local business, where it sells daily deals, for the rest of this year. The other segments the company operates in are consumer goods and travel.Net loss attributable to Groupon narrowed to $14.3 million, or 2 cents per share, for the quarter ended March 31, from $37.8 million, or 6 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, the company earned 3 cents per share, beating the average analyst estimate of a profit of 1 cent per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Revenue rose to $750.4 million from $728.4 million.The company's stock fell 2 percent to $6.70 in extended trading.

707,"   By Lucia Mutikani | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON U.S. private employers in April hired the fewest number of workers in more than a year, further diminishing hopes of a strong rebound in economic growth after the first-quarter slump.The tepid private job gains combined with other data on Wednesday showing a second straight quarterly decline in productivity make it less likely the U.S. Federal Reserve will raise interest rates in June as had been expected at the start of the year.""The data pile onto recent evidence suggesting increased odds that, by the time the June policy meeting rolls around, the  hope of a great spring rebound in real growth will have faded,"" said Steve Blitz, chief economist at ITG Investment Research in New York.Private payrolls increased 169,000 last month, the smallest gain since January 2014, the ADP National Employment Report showed. That was well below economists' expectations for an increase of 200,000 jobs. Hiring slowed almost across the board, with manufacturing losing 10,000 jobs after eliminating 3,000 positions in March, likely reflecting the impact of a strong dollar. Private sector job growth has slowed since November.March private payrolls were revised down to show 14,000 fewer jobs created than previously reported. The report jointly developed with Moody's Analytics was released ahead of the government's more comprehensive employment report on Friday.The ADP has a poor track record of predicting nonfarm payrolls, and most economists are maintaining their forecasts for a bounce back in job growth after March's sharp slowdown, which was blamed on bad weather. They, however, acknowledged there was a slight downside risk. According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased 224,000 in April after rising by 126,000 in March. ""ADP typically doesn't do a good job of picking up short-term swings from weather and other temporary factors,"" said Ted Wieseman, an economist at Morgan Stanley in New York.""After over-predicting the nonfarm payrolls number in March, ADP will probably undershoot in April as weather swings in the positive direction."" Payrolls will be scrutinized closely for clues on the economy's strength after a mix of cold weather, the buoyant dollar, port disruptions and deep spending cuts by energy firms held first-quarter growth to an anemic 0.2 percent annual pace. But Tuesday's weak March trade data suggests the economy actually contracted in the first three months of the year after expanding at a 2.2 percent pace in the fourth quarter. The dollar hit a 10-week low against the euro on the data and a spike in European bond yields, which buoyed demand for the single currency. U.S. Treasury debt prices fell on the European bond sell-off and Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) announcement of a new seven-part bond to help fund dividends and share buybacks. Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower after Fed Chair Janet Yellen warned that equity market valuations at ""this point generally are quite high.""PRODUCTIVITY WEAK  Despite its spotty record, the ADP report joined data on automobile sales and manufacturing in suggesting moderate momentum in the economy at the start of the second quarter. In a separate report, the Labor Department said nonfarm productivity declined at a 1.9 percent annual rate in the first quarter after dropping at a 2.1 percent pace in the fourth quarter. That was the first back-to-back fall in productivity since 2006.Productivity rose 0.6 percent from a year ago. Unit labor costs, the price of labor per single unit of output, increased at a 5.0 percent rate in the first quarter. That was the fastest pace since the first quarter of 2014, and followed a 4.2 percent rate of increase in the fourth quarter. The steadily rising labor costs against the backdrop of weak productivity could further squeeze corporate profits, which already are being pressured by the dollar.""The weakness of productivity is another reason to believe that the Fed will begin to raise interest rates in the second half of this year,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics in Toronto.Unit labor costs rose only 1.1 percent compared to the first quarter of 2014, a sign that wage inflation remains benign.But there are signs wage growth is firming.

709,"  * EU to review web market, considering new regulation* Part of broad ""digital single market"" strategy* Competition officials also looking into e-commerce   (Adds industry reactions, recasts throughout)By Julia FiorettiBRUSSELS, May 6 The EU unveiled plans to shake up rules for online services in the hope that breaking down borders can revive the bloc's economy, but risks accusations of trying to throw up new barriers to the U.S. firms that dominate its market.With some fanfare, the European Commission presented a range of broad policy proposals on Wednesday. They range from possible new regulation for Web platforms like Google and Facebook to popular plans for cutting delivery costs on online shopping over EU borders and ending blocks on watching online videos abroad.The Digital Single Market Strategy is central to Jean-Claude Juncker's strategy to create jobs across the 28-nation bloc and the Commission president, in office since November, won cautious plaudits from across EU politics for what remain general ideas.""Today, we lay the groundwork for Europe's digital future,"" said Juncker, who posted a jokey online video for the occasion, seeking to burnish the EU's threadbare populist credentials. ""I want to see pan-continental telecoms networks, digital services that cross borders and a wave of innovative European start-ups. I want to see every consumer getting the best deals and every business accessing the widest market,"" he said.Representatives of big U.S. tech companies, however, already smarting from last month's move by the new Commission to pursue Google on antitrust charges, warned against snaring fast-moving industries in ways that would hurt a Europe that U.S. President Barack Obama recently accused of taking a protectionist turn.""The idea of regulating platforms is ill-conceived,"" the Computer and Communications Industry Association (CCIA) said in a statement after confirmation of the EU plan to complete a major review of the platform business by the end of the year to assess the value of calls for them to be more tightly overseen.Such rules could hurt the small European start-ups more than incumbent global giants with big legal teams, the CCIA argued. E-COMMERCE INQUIRY As well as the inquiry into online platforms, the EU's competition commissioner confirmed she would investigate the e-commerce sector for possible breaches of antitrust law, especially in relation to postal charges.European Union leaders reject charges of anti-Americanism in their efforts to reshape online markets at home. But there is no lack of suspicion among European voters and politicians at the power of U.S. tech companies, not least following revelations in recent years that Washington has been spying on its allies. ""Europeanisation of digital policy is absolutely the way to go,"" said Guenther Oettinger, the commissioner for the digital economy. ""(It) will give us digital sovereignty which we don't always have.""A German conservative, Oettinger is a vocal critic of U.S. might in a sector where German media companies have, for example, been lobbying to protect content from online giants.The review of platforms, which had been expected, will focus on the transparency of search results and pricing policies, how platforms use data they acquire, their relationships with other businesses and how fairly they promote their own services.The overall strategy, laid out by Juncker's vice-president for digital Andrus Ansip, includes a set of initiatives focusing on reforming copyright and national telecoms rules, knocking down barriers to cross-border parcel deliveries and helping start-ups to sell online by simplifying sales tax across the EU.He aims to deliver on his promises by the end of next year, setting up battles with a variety of industrial interests.EU telecoms regulations will also be overhauled next year.Telecom operators welcomed the announcement, saying that reforming the rules would lead to greater investment in Europe's ageing copper networks. But alternative operators warned against tolerating monopoly power to subsidise spending.

713,"   By Nandita Bose and Kshitiz Goliya  Groupon Inc (GRPN.O) forecast full-year revenue well below analyst expectations on Tuesday, hurt by a stronger dollar and weaker-than-expected billings, a key metric reflecting the gross amount collected from customers.Groupon, which once dominated the fast-growing online coupons arena, has been struggling to rev up sales and profit as it battles stiff competition from smaller companies as well as online giants such as Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O).In April, the daily deals and online retailer agreed to sell a 46 percent stake in its South Korean business as part of its turnaround efforts.Chief Executive Eric Lefkofsky told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday the company will evaluate alternatives that would help unlock shareholder value in countries where Groupon questions its long-term strategic positioning, as it did in Korea.The company, which gets 160 million visitors globally per month, saw a drop in active customers to 48 million as of March 31 from 54 million as of Dec. 31, 2014. On an adjusted basis after the stake sale, active users increased marginally quarter-over-quarter, to 48.1 million from 47.4 million.Lefkofsky said the company aims to double the number of deals over the next year so that Groupon always has deals on offer within its top categories. ""To date, we've had a one-size-fits-all approach when it comes to merchants, and over time, we've come to realize it's too limiting,"" he said.Groupon forecast 2015 revenue of between $3.15 billion and $3.3 billion, below the $3.53 billion analysts on average were expecting, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.""The deterioration in sales growth is a concern for Groupon,"" Neil Saunders, chief executive of research firm Conlumino, said. ""If repeated across the remainder of this year it will make the group's quest for profitability even more challenging than it has been to date."" The company said it expected changes in foreign exchange rates to hurt its year-over-year revenue growth rate by 700 basis points.Groupon reported gross billings of $1.55 billion for the first quarter, well below the average analyst estimate of $1.86 billion, according to market research firm FactSet StreetAccount.Net loss attributable to common stockholders narrowed to $14.3 million, or 2 cents per share, for the quarter ended March 31, from $37.8 million, or 6 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, the company earned 3 cents per share, beating an average analyst estimate of a profit of 1 cent per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Revenue rose to $750.4 million from $728.4 million.The company's stock fell 2 percent to $6.70 in extended trading.

716,"   By David Randall | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Even as the rise of online retailers such as Amazon.com Inc leads analysts to predict the eventual death of the American shopping mall, real estate fund managers are betting some will prosper – if they can lure the right kind of consumer.Simon Property Group Inc, the largest high-end mall operator in the country with properties including Palo Alto, California's Stanford Shopping Center and suburban Philadelphia's King of Prussia Mall is the top holding in 53 of the 71 U.S. real estate funds tracked by Lipper. The average real estate fund devotes 8.8 percent of its portfolio to Simon, a bigger average bet than the 7.6 percent that tech funds invest in Apple Inc and almost one percentage point more than the weight of Simon in the benchmark S&P U.S. REIT index.Still a symbol of a car-based, middle-class suburban America, malls are increasingly seen as viable only if they attract the affluent. Fund managers are bullish on so-called Class A malls, anchored by department stores like Bloomingdale’s and featuring retailers like Apple, reflecting how better-off consumers have thrived since the end of the financial crisis while middle and lower income consumers have struggled. ""Class A malls are repositioning themselves to be destinations, with more restaurants, which is making them more resilient to what's going on with the Internet,"" said Rick Romano, a portfolio manager of the $3.8 billion Prudential Global Real Estate fund, who holds 4.5 percent of his portfolio in Simon, his top holding.Class A malls are also the only shopping centers able to attract an Apple store, which can post annual sales of more than $5,000 a square foot - the highest of any U.S. retailer - and boost sales growth for other retailers throughout the mall, Romano said. As a result, Simon has been able to post rent increases of 18.9 percent for new leases over the last 12 months, according to Paul Morgan, an analyst at MLV & Co.Simon's average rent per square foot – which includes ongoing and new leases – rose 4.5 percent in the first quarter compared with the year before, or about six times the 0.8 percent pace of inflation in the U.S. Bloomingdale's is the most frequent anchor store at the highest-rated malls in the country, followed by Nordstrom.Those Americans in the top 20 percent of income – or Class A mall shoppers – have seen their household assets jump from about $15 trillion in 2010 to $25 trillion in 2014, according to Green Street Advisors. Household assets for Class B and lower mall customers rose from about $7 trillion in 2010 to a little over $10 trillion in 2014. Class B malls are often saddled with struggling department stores such as Sears or J.C. Penney as anchors, making them less attractive to prospective tenants. Some 24 such malls have closed since 2010, and an additional 60 are on the brink of closure, according to Green Street Advisors.No REIT fund hold Class B or lower mall operators as their largest holding, according to Lipper. J.C Penney and Sears are the most frequent anchor stores at Class C and lower malls, according to Green Street.There are about 1,000 enclosed shopping malls in the U.S. Foot traffic at malls during the November and December holiday shopping season fell from approximately 35 billion visits in 2010 to 17.6 billion in 2013, according to an October Cushman and Wakefield report. Online commerce now accounts for 15 percent of retail sales - just 5 percentage points less than the percentage of retail sales that come from malls and gaining, according to a report from Green Street Advisors.      DEMAND FOR HIGH-END RISING  Investor demand for high-end malls will rise even if consumer spending overall flattens or starts to slow, said Jason Ko, a co-portfolio manager of the $2.1 billion J.P. Morgan Realty Income fund who has 7.8 percent of his portfolio in Simon, his largest position.Macerich Co, the third-largest mall owner in the U.S., rejected a $16.8 billion takeover offer from Simon Property on April 1, a merger that would give Simon an even larger hold of the high-end mall market. Simon is not expected to come back with a higher offer, analysts and fund managers said.""What that attempt signifies is that high quality malls are irreplaceable: difficult to build and difficult to buy,"" Ko said.Shares of Simon Property are down 5.5 percent since Macerich rejected its takeover offer, while shares of Macerich have fallen 2.2 percent over the same time. Over the last 12 months, shares of Simon are up 5.7 percent, or about 2 percentage points less than the 7.9 percent gain in the benchmark index. Simon shares closed Wednesday at $181.31, compared with the average target price of $217.05 among analysts tracked by Thomson Reuters. At that price, Simon is selling at 39 times trailing 12 month earnings, slightly below the average 45 times earnings among its peers, according to Thomson Reuters data.Class B malls, meanwhile, will not only feel the effects of sales declines at J.C. Penney and Sears, but will see increased competition from so-called power centers - suburban developments that are often next to a major highway and include a Home Depot or Best Buy alongside a traditional strip mall, said Ian Goltra, who helps oversee $2 billion in real estate investments at San Francisco-based Forward Funds.Goltra has several short positions for Class B mall operators in his funds, yet expects shares of Simon to rise, even with its high percentage of fund ownership. He has been adding shares of Simon as it has traded in the $180s, down from a high of $205.31 on Jan 28th.""They have the largest portfolio of blue-chip tenants, and that's something their competitors have not been able to replicate,"" he said.   (Reporting by David Randall; editing by Linda Stern and John Pickering)",2015-05-14,AMZN,"Thu May 14, 2015 | 1:31am EDT",Fund managers make big bet on high-end malls via Simon,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-funds-malls-analysis-idUSKBN0NZ0B620150514?type=companyNews

However, investments in e-commerce shaved 2 cents off the retailer's earnings per share, equal to the cost impact in the quarter of its move to raise wages for entry level workers across the U.S.Because of the high growth rates, most analysts see merit in investing aggressively in e-commerce. But as Wal-Mart prepares to test a free shipping program aimed at undercutting Amazon on price, the prospect of competing with a rival that spends heavily on investments has raised some concerns. ""They continue to try to grow e-commerce which is good because it is growing. But it comes at a cost,"" said Brian Yarbrough, retail analyst at Edward Jones.Wal-Mart has said it would invest $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion on e-commerce this year. It plans to open four large dedicated fulfillment centers - adding to 11 facilities in operation already, and the dozens of conventional distribution centers refitted to help in the online push.But for Wal-Mart the biggest plus in its plan is a network of 4,500 stores. It already uses more than 80 for distribution, accounting for a fifth of its online deliveries on a unit basis. Wal-Mart booked $12 billion in online revenues last year. ""We feel like that's a great advantage that we can leverage,"" Wal-Mart Chief Financial Officer Charles Holley said on Tuesday, when asked about competition with Amazon. He said his response was not particular to Amazon.Converting conventional distribution centers to handle e-commerce probably costs $20 million to $40 million dollars each, while building a large-scale fulfillment facility from scratch can cost $150 million, estimates Steven Osburn, director at Kurt Salmon specializing in supply chain.Given that, any attempt to catch up with Amazon could run into the billions of dollars, Osburn said. ""However, finding ways to use their existing infrastructure better is a much cheaper way to go about it."" Even then, Wal-Mart would likely need at least 5 to 10 more dedicated fulfillment centers, Osburn said: ""You are still probably talking a billion dollars plus in investment if this catches on."" Shipping costs are another concern. Forrester Research analyst Sucharita Mulpuru estimates Amazon could be losing $2 billion a year on shipments to members of its Prime program, which offers free shipping on most items for a $99 annual fee.Wal-Mart's pilot program is offering free shipping within three days for a fee of $50, half the cost of Prime.While Mulpuru believes Wal-Mart would find it difficult to put a big dent in Amazon's market share, she reckons it could make gains by capitalizing on its strengths, such as its strong relationships with packaged goods makers and in groceries.David Cheesewright, head of Wal-Mart's international division, pointed to the company's strong position in online groceries in Britain as know-how that could be leveraged elsewhere.""I think particularly in the area of grocery, where product knowledge, understanding of the fresh supply chain, operational excellence, is going to be a key part of being successful in that space,"" Cheesewright said on the media call after the release of its earnings.

719,"   By Nivedita Bhattacharjee | MUMBAI  MUMBAI Indian e-commerce firms are offering funding help and tech support to woo small retailers, emulating a strategy used by Chinese online retail giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd to expand into the towns and villages home to the majority of consumers.India's biggest e-tailers such as Flipkart, Snapdeal and the local arm of Amazon.com Inc are online marketplaces, with commission from sellers accounting for the bulk of their revenue.This makes tapping the small and medium enterprises vital to India's economic growth key, as these firms account for about 45 percent of the country's total industrial output, business lobby SME Chamber of India says, and have a strong following in the towns and rural areas where hundreds of millions of Indians are rapidly coming online thanks to cheap smartphones.    ""Alibaba is our big inspiration. We are following their model because they have created something impactful,"" Snapdeal Chief Executive Kunal Bahl told reporters on Thursday.Alibaba, the world's biggest e-commerce firm by transaction value, supports small businesses on its platforms. Bahl was speaking after Snapdeal followed Amazon.com in launching a partnership with the country's largest lender, the State Bank of India, to help provide funding to small retailers that sell on their websites.These sellers are often unable to get bank loans easily, which stymies their growth, Bahl added. ""They can buy and sell more. Their margins improve and they reinvest. It's a win-win for us,"" he said.

720,"   By Nivedita Bhattacharjee | MUMBAI  MUMBAI Indian e-commerce firms are offering funding help and tech support to woo small retailers, emulating a strategy used by Chinese online retail giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd to expand into the towns and villages home to the majority of consumers.India's biggest e-tailers such as Flipkart, Snapdeal and the local arm of Amazon.com Inc are online marketplaces, with commission from sellers accounting for the bulk of their revenue.This makes tapping the small and medium enterprises vital to India's economic growth key, as these firms account for about 45 percent of the country's total industrial output, business lobby SME Chamber of India says, and have a strong following in the towns and rural areas where hundreds of millions of Indians are rapidly coming online thanks to cheap smartphones.    ""Alibaba is our big inspiration. We are following their model because they have created something impactful,"" Snapdeal Chief Executive Kunal Bahl told reporters on Thursday.Alibaba, the world's biggest e-commerce firm by transaction value, supports small businesses on its platforms. Bahl was speaking after Snapdeal followed Amazon.com in launching a partnership with the country's largest lender, the State Bank of India, to help provide funding to small retailers that sell on their websites.These sellers are often unable to get bank loans easily, which stymies their growth, Bahl added. ""They can buy and sell more. Their margins improve and they reinvest. It's a win-win for us,"" he said.

721,"  * Parcel revenue up 1 pct, letters down 1 pct* Warns parcel pricing pressure to continue* CEO Greene says no plans to quit   (Recasts, adds CEO, analyst quotes)By Neil MaidmentLONDON, May 21 Intense competition in the parcels market from rivals including Amazon will leave Britain's Royal Mail reliant  on cost controls and efficiency improvements to underpin profits this year.Parcels, which generate half of Royal Mail's 9.4 billion pound ($14.7 billion) revenues, are the firm's focus in light of declining letter volumes. However, growth forecasts have had to be cut because of overcapacity in the market that led to the demise of rival City Link last December.Royal Mail forecast last November that growth in the British parcels market would fall from 4-5 percent to 1-2 percent for at least two years as Amazon delivers more of its own packages and others seek to muscle in on rising online retail demand. ""We've got a number of competitors adding new capacity in 2015, which is going to keep putting downward pressure on pricing,"" Royal Mail boss Moya Greene said on Thursday as the company announced annual financial results.Greene declined to say if parcel revenues would grow in 2015 but said Royal Mail was focused on keeping costs flat or reducing them. The company has 130,000 staff, down almost 30,000 since 2007.Shares in the firm, controversially privatised in October 2013, traded 1.2 percent lower at 493.6p at 0855 GMT. The shares were floated at a price of 330p in 2013 but quickly shot up in value, prompting criticism that taxpayers had been ripped off.Britain's government still owns 30 percent of the company. Royal Mail said adjusted operating profit before transformation costs for the year to March 29 was 740 million pounds, up 6 percent on a year ago and ahead of forecasts of 712 million. Including pensions accounting and other one-off items, however, profit was down 9 percent on a reported basis.The performance was helped by a better than expected 1 percent fall in operating costs. The company increased its dividend 5 percent to 21p.""Royal Mail will continue to benefit from one-off gains which will help support a progressive dividend but earnings are likely to continue to come under pressure,"" said Cantor analyst Robin Byde, who has a sell rating on the stock. The company did get a boost last week when Whistl, owned by Dutch PostNL, suspended plans for a UK-wide rival mail delivery service that could have hit its revenues by 200 million pounds.Chairman Donald Brydon announced in January he would step down this year, prompting some analysts to speculate Greene could follow having seen the firm through its privatisation.However the Canadian told Reuters she wasn't going anywhere.""I love Royal Mail. I'm in here every morning with bells on. I've always said I'm here as long as the shareholders want me to stay,"" Greene said.($1 = 0.6427 pounds)   (Editing by Keith Weir)",2015-05-21,AMZN,"Thu May 21, 2015 | 5:36am EDT","UPDATE 2-Royal Mail sees tough parcel market, focuses on costs",http://www.reuters.com//article/royal-mail-results-idUSL5N0YC0UU20150521?type=companyNews

724,"   By Tom Bergin | LONDON  LONDON Amazon’s decision to change its tax-efficient European business structure could raise its tax bill by as much as $100 million a year but authorities will have to fight for additional money and any payments will be hidden from public view.Amazon has become one of the highest profile targets of an international drive against tax avoidance that has gained pace in Europe in recent years.The company has historically paid little tax in Europe because its clients did business online with Luxembourg-based companies, the biggest of which is Amazon EU Sarl. Consequently, authorities across the continent could not use its sales revenues as a basis for assessing tax.That’s why Amazon's main German operating unit paid just 11.9 million euros ($16 million) in tax in 2014, despite the group recording $11.9 billion in sales to German customers last year. But Amazon said at the weekend that from May 1, it had started to book sales in the UK, Germany, Italy and Spain via local branches of Amazon EU Sarl. Under international tax rules, this means Amazon EU Sarl will now have to pay tax in those countries on the share of its profits generated by the branches.The problem for European tax authorities is that Amazon EU Sarl makes modest profits. Indeed, last year it reported a loss of around 10 million euros on turnover of over 15 billion euros, filings show. That’s partly down to tight margins but also because Amazon EU Sarl pays large fees to its parent, a tax exempt Luxembourg partnership called Amazon Europe Holding Technologies SCS, for the right to use Amazon patents.This arrangement, which is being investigated by the European Commission, allowed Amazon Europe Holding Technologies SCS, to make profits of 346 million euros in 2014, filings show. It paid no tax on this money.Under the new structure, Amazon EU Sarl is obliged to pay tax on profits generated by sales in the UK and Germany, but Amazon Europe Holding Technologies is not.“Amazon will have to pay more tax ... (but) I think the amount of additional tax paid will be very small,” said Chas Roy-Chowdhury, Head of Taxation at accounting group ACCA.However, under the new system, tax authorities in Britain, Germany, Italy and Spain will, for the first time, have the right to challenge the reasonableness of the payments between Amazon EU Sarl and Amazon Europe Holding Technologies. “I expect they will challenge that,” Roy-Chowdhury said.If national tax authorities were successful in challenging the inter-company arrangements, they could bring hundreds of millions of euros back into the tax net, and potentially raise an additional $100 million in tax, according to Reuters calculations based on reported profits and prevailing tax rates.Amazon declined to comment on the level of its tax bill but a spokesman said: “Corporate tax is based on profits, not revenues. E-commerce is a low-margin business and highly competitive, and Amazon continues to invest heavily around the world, which means our profits are low.”DIVERTED PROFITS TAX  Amazon said it regularly reviews its structures “to ensure that we are able to best serve our customer” and that it commenced the move to opening branches two years ago.Roy-Chowdhury said the change may have been influenced by the British government’s decision to introduce a new ‘diverted profits tax’ (DPT) this year. Amazon had UK sales of $8 billion in 2014, filings show. The DPT aims to tax profits that companies shift out of Britain by channeling their sales through low tax jurisdictions.The UK Treasury declined to comment on Amazon's shift.Tax campaigner Richard Murphy said the Europe-wide nature of Amazon's move meant it was likely motivated by the European Commission’s investigation into Amazon’s agreements with the Luxembourg tax authority.The Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, is looking into whether the deals signed off by the Luxembourg authority were unreasonably favorable to the U.S. group and given to attract jobs to Luxembourg. Murphy said other companies involved in EU probes, including Apple Inc, may also feel under pressure to change their arrangements.Another company whose tax deals are the subject of an EU probe, Starbucks Corp, announced last year that it was overhauling its European structure. If Amazon’s move means it does start to pay more tax, it will no longer be possible to see where this is being paid. That’s because Amazon has chosen to establish branches rather than new subsidiaries. The latter must file accounts which would show sales, profits and tax payments by country. Branches don’t have to publish these figures.“Overseas companies are never required to file UK establishment (branch) accounts with Companies House,” a spokeswoman for Companies House, the UK corporate register said.Rather, a foreign company with the UK branch simply has to file its own accounts at the register. These do not usually show sales, profits and taxes for each country where there is a branch.“It’s harder to get any information about a branch ... it’s a bit more of an opaque structure,” said Daniel Reid, partner at tax advisers DRG.A German accountant who asked not to be named said similar rules applied in Germany.Amazon declined to say if it selected branches rather than subsidiaries for privacy reasons.

738,"   By Sharon Begley | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Amazon.com Inc is in a race against Google Inc to store data on human DNA, seeking both bragging rights in helping scientists make new medical discoveries and market share in a business that may be worth $1 billion a year by 2018.Academic institutions and healthcare companies are picking sides between their cloud computing offerings - Google Genomics or Amazon Web Services - spurring the two to one-up each other as they win high-profile genomics business, according to interviews with researchers, industry consultants and analysts.        That growth is being propelled by, among other forces, the push for personalized medicine, which aims to base treatments on a patient's DNA profile. Making that a reality will require enormous quantities of data to reveal how particular genetic profiles respond to different treatments.     Already, universities and drug manufacturers are embarking on projects to sequence the genomes of hundreds of thousands of people. The human genome is the full complement of DNA, or genetic material, a copy of which is found in nearly every cell of the body.    Clients view Google and Amazon as doing a better job storing genomics data than they can do using their own computers, keeping it secure, controlling costs and allowing it to be easily shared.    The cloud companies are going beyond storage to offer analytical functions that let scientists make sense of DNA data. Microsoft Corp and International Business Machines are also competing for a slice of the market. The ""cloud"" refers to data or software that physically resides in a server and is accessible via the internet, which allows users to access it without downloading it to their own computer.     Now an estimated $100 million to $300 million business globally, the cloud genomics market is expected to grow to $1 billion by 2018, said research analyst Daniel Ives of investment bank FBR Capital. By that time, the entire cloud market should have $50 billion to $75 billion in annual revenue, up from about $30 billion now.    ""The cloud is the entire future of this field,"" Craig Venter, who led a private effort to sequence the human genome in the 1990s, said in an interview. His new company, San Diego-based Human Longevity Inc, recently tried to import genomic data from servers at the J. Craig Venter Institute in Rockville, Maryland.     The transmission was so slow, scientists had to resort to sending disks and thumb drives by FedEx and human messengers, or ""sneakernet,"" he said. The company now uses Amazon Web Services.    So does a collaboration between Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc and Pennsylvania-based Geisinger Health Systems to sequence 250,000 genomes. Raw DNA data is uploaded to Amazon's cloud, where software from privately-held DNAnexus assembles the millions of chunks into the full, 3-billion-letter long genome.     DNAnexus's algorithms then determine where an individual genome differs from the ""reference"" human genome, the company’s chief scientist Dr. David Shaywitz said, in hopes of identifying new drug targets.     HOSTING FOR FREE     Showing how important Google and Amazon view this business, and how they hope to use existing customers to lure future ones, each is hosting well-known genomics datasets for free.    Neither company discloses the amount of genomics data it holds, but based on interviews with analysts and genomic scientists, as well as the companies' own announcements of what customers they’ve won, Amazon Web Services may be bigger.     Data from the ""1000 Genomes Project,"" an international public-private effort that identified genetic variations found in at least 1 percent of humans, reside at both Amazon and Google ""without charge,"" said Kathy Cravedi of the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH), one of the project's sponsors.    Other paying clients with a more specific focus are picking sides.     Google, for instance, won a project from the Autism Speaks foundation to collect and analyze the genomes of 10,000 affected children and their parents for clues to the genetic basis of autism. Another customer is Tute Genomics, whose database of 8.5 billion human DNA variants can be searched for how frequently any given variant appears, what traits it's associated with and how people with a certain variant respond to particular drugs.    Amazon is hosting the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation’s project to collect complete-genome sequences and other data from 1,000 patients to identify new drug targets. It also won the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project, which has similar aims.    Amazon charges about $4 to $5 a month to store one full human genome, and Google about $3 to $5 a month. The companies also charge for data transfers or computing time, as when scientists run analytical software on stored data.     Amazon's database-analysis tool, Redshift, costs 25 cents an hour or $1,000 per terabyte per year, the company said. A terabyte is 1 trillion bytes, or 1,000 gigabytes, about enough to hold 300 hours of high-quality video.    GENETIC GOLD      Another part of the cloud services' pitch to would-be customers is that their analytic tools can fish out genetic gold - a drug target, say, or a DNA variant that strongly predicts disease risk - from a sea of data. Any discoveries made through such searches belong to the owners of the data.    ""On the local university server it might take months to run a computationally-intense"" analysis, said Alzheimer’s project leader Dr. Gerard Schellenberg of the University of Pennsylvania. ""On Amazon, it's, 'how fast do you need it done?', and they do it.""    Another selling point is security. Universities are ""generally pretty porous,"" said Ryan Permeh, chief scientist at cybersecurity company Cylance Inc, of Irvine, California, and the security of federal government computers is ""not at the top of the class.""       While academic and pharmaceutical research projects are the biggest customers for genomics cloud services, they will be overtaken by clinical applications in the next 10 years, said Google Genomics director of engineering David Glazer.     Individual doctors will regularly access a cloud service to understand how a patient's genetic profile affects his risk of various diseases or his likely response to medication.     ""We are at that transition point now,"" Glazer said.     Matt Wood, general manager for Data Science at Amazon Web Services, sees cloud demand in genomics now as ""a perfect storm,"" as the amount of data being created, the need for collaboration and the move of genomics into clinical care accelerate.    Experts on DNA and data say without access to the cloud, modern genomics would grind to a halt.    Bioinformatics expert Dr. Atul Butte of the University of California, San Francisco, said that now, when researchers at different universities are jointly working on NIH and other genomic data, they don't have to figure out how to make their computers talk to each other.

DNAnexus's algorithms then determine where an individual genome differs from the ""reference"" human genome, the company's chief scientist Dr. David Shaywitz said, in hopes of identifying new drug targets.  >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> HEALTH-GENOMICS-CLOUD: How pharmaceutical researchers use Amazon web services to store and analyze DNA sequences. link.reuters.com/kan84w >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>HOSTING FOR FREE Showing how important Google and Amazon view this business, and how they hope to use existing customers to lure future ones, each is hosting well-known genomics datasets for free.Neither company discloses the amount of genomics data it holds, but based on interviews with analysts and genomic scientists, as well as the companies' own announcements of what customers they've won, Amazon Web Services may be bigger.Data from the ""1000 Genomes Project,"" an international public-private effort that identified genetic variations found in at least 1 percent of humans, reside at both Amazon and Google ""without charge,"" said Kathy Cravedi of the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH), one of the project's sponsors.Other paying clients with a more specific focus are picking sides. Google, for instance, won a project from the Autism Speaks foundation to collect and analyze the genomes of 10,000 affected children and their parents for clues to the genetic basis of autism.Another customer is Tute Genomics, whose database of 8.5 billion human DNA variants can be searched for how frequently any given variant appears, what traits it's associated with and how people with a certain variant respond to particular drugs.Amazon is hosting the Multiple Myeloma Foundation's project to collect complete-genome sequences and other data from 1,000 patients to identify new drug targets. It also won the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project, which has similar aims.Amazon charges about $4 to $5 a month to store one full human genome, and Google about $3 to $5 a month. The companies also charge for data transfers or computing time, as when scientists run analytical software on stored data.Amazon's database-analysis tool, Redshift, costs 25 cents an hour or $1,000 per terabyte per year, the company said. A terabyte is 1 trillion bytes, or 1,000 gigabytes, about enough to hold 300 hours of high-quality video.GENETIC GOLD  Another part of the cloud services' pitch to would-be customers is that their analytic tools can fish out genetic gold - a drug target, say, or a DNA variant that strongly predicts disease risk - from a sea of data. Any discoveries made through such searches belong to the owners of the data.""On the local university server it might take months to run a computationally-intense"" analysis, said Alzheimer's project leader Dr. Gerard Schellenberg of the University of Pennsylvania. ""On Amazon, it's, 'how fast do you need it done?', and they do it.""Another selling point is security. Universities are ""generally pretty porous,"" said Ryan Permeh, chief scientist at cybersecurity company Cylance Inc., of Irvine, California, and the security of federal government computers is ""not at the top of the class.""While academic and pharmaceutical research projects are the biggest customers for genomics cloud services, they will be overtaken by clinical applications in the next 10 years, said Google Genomics director of engineering David Glazer.Individual doctors will regularly access a cloud service to understand how a patient's genetic profile affects his risk of various diseases or his likely response to medication.""We are at that transition point now,"" Glazer said.Matt Wood, general manager for Data Science at Amazon Web Services, sees cloud demand in genomics now as ""a perfect storm,"" as the amount of data being created, the need for collaboration and the move of genomics into clinical care accelerate.Experts on DNA and data say without access to the cloud, modern genomics would grind to a halt.Bioinformatics expert Dr. Atul Butte of the University of California, San Francisco, said that now, when researchers at different universities are jointly working on NIH and other genomic data, they don't have to figure out how to make their computers talk to each other. In March, NIH cleared the way for major research on the cloud when it began allowing scientists to upload important genomic data.""My response was, it's about time,"" Butte said.(Reporting by Sharon Begley and Caroline Humer; Editing by Michele Gershberg and John Pickering)",2015-06-05,AMZN,"Fri Jun 5, 2015 | 7:00am EDT","RPT - INSIGHT-Amazon, Google race to get your DNA into the cloud",http://www.reuters.com//article/health-genomics-cloud-idUSL1N0YQ2MG20150605?type=companyNews

746,"   By Dan Levine | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO At least two Apple Inc retail store workers complained directly to Chief Executive Tim Cook that the company's policy of checking retail employees' bags as a security precaution was embarrassing and demeaning, according to a court filing made public on Wednesday.The employee complaints, which a judge ordered unsealed, are part of a 2013 lawsuit alleging Apple should compensate employees for the time it takes to conduct the searches. One worker, whose name was blacked out of the court filing, told Cook in a 2012 message that Apple managers ""are required to treat 'valued' employees as criminals.""Cook forwarded it to top retail and human resources executives with the query: ""Is this true?"" The court filing does not include what responses Cook received. An Apple representative could not immediately be reached for comment. In the lawsuit, plaintiffs Amanda Friekin and Dean Pelle alleged that ""screenings"" or bag searches, designed to discourage theft, are conducted every time sales reps leave the store, including for meal breaks. The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, seeks class action status. Lawsuits from within Apple's ranks are rare.A U.S. Supreme Court ruling last December, in a case involving an Amazon.com Inc warehouse contractor, handed a victory to employers, ruling that companies do not have to pay employees for the time they spend undergoing security checks at the end of their shifts. The Supreme Court found that because screening process is not a ""principal activity"" of the workers' jobs under a federal labor law it is not subject to compensation. In the 2012 email to Cook, with a subject line ""Fearless Feedback from Apple Retail Specialist,"" the employee said Apple's policy implies the company does not trust its workers.""These procedures are often performed in front of gawking customers,"" the employee wrote, adding that workers deserve to be treated with the same respect that Apple shows customers.

However, it should not abuse its market dominance, Vestager said.""Amazon should not use its strong position to close the door behind it and prevent companies with new ideas from contesting the market,"" she told a conference. The company could be fined up to 10 percent of its global turnover if found guilty of breaching EU rules.The investigation is one of two against Amazon. It is also in the European Commission's crosshairs for deals with Luxembourg which allow it to pay extremely low taxes.The EU competition authority is investigating whether the case gives Amazon an unfair advantage. Vestager also said she was wary of too many mergers in the telecoms sector, warning that consumers could end up with higher bills and less innovative companies.""Incumbent operators argue that if they cannot merge with their rivals in the same country they will be unable to increase their investment. I've heard this claim quite often, but I have not seen evidence that this is the case,"" she said. ""Instead, there is ample evidence that excessive consolidation may lead not only to less competition and more expensive bills for consumers, but that it also reduces the incentives in national markets to innovate.""Vestager's comments come as she scrutinises a proposal by Norwegian telecoms company Telenor and Swedish peer TeliaSonera to combine their Danish mobile businesses.She has already expressed concerns the deal may lead to higher prices.A bigger deal is expected to land on her desk in the coming months: Hutchison Whampoa's bid to become Britain's biggest operator by buying Telefonica's British business, O2 UK, for 10.3 billion pounds ($16 billion).

Misener is scheduled to appear Wednesday before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee as part of a witness panel that also includes a senior Federal Aviation Administration official and a privacy advocate.Amazon.com and other companies including Google Inc  are working to develop sophisticated drone operations capable of delivering packages to consumers. Drone advocates have pressed the FAA to accommodate advanced technology in commercial drone regulations expected by the end of 2016.

770,"   By Mari Saito | SAN FRANCISCO, June 24  SAN FRANCISCO, June 24 Amazon.com Inc  and eBay Inc sharply cut the number of Confederate flag products on their sites a day after vowing to remove them, but in a sign of the difficulty of removing controversial content, Nazi-era memorabilia are listed on both sites.EBay specifically bans their sale while Amazon bans the sale of ""products that promote or glorify hatred, violence, racial, sexual or religious intolerance or promote organizations with such views.""It is difficult to enforce a complete ban on controversial products, analysts said, because of technological hurdles in flagging and pulling down banned items. ""For Amazon and eBay, it's a question of scale. eBay has had to work on everything from Nazi memorabilia to counterfeit jewelry and one of the hardest parts at their scale is to look at keywords, identify sellers with problems and flag issues,"" said Derek Bambauer, a professor at the University of Arizona who specializes in Internet law.Amazon, which on Tuesday had listed nearly 30,000 items in a search for ""Confederate flag"", had almost nothing for sale with the flag late afternoon Wednesday. Dylann Roof, the white 21-year-old charged with nine counts of murder in connection with the killings at a historically black church in South Carolina last week, posed with a Confederate flag in photos posted online.The shooting has spawned a nationwide movement to eradicate symbols of the Confederacy from public spaces, license plates and retail stores, with both Wal-Mart Stores Inc and Sears Holdings Corp stopping sales. Ebay's Tuesday listing of 1,377 items had shrunk to 466. The company said it uses a combination of automated and manual steps to flag and remove problematic listings, and it did not say why so many items remained.Another challenge to keeping controversial products off the sites involves the guidelines the companies use. Despite its general ban on Nazi memorabilia, eBay list certain items from that era, which a representative said recognized the historical significance of World War II.A search by Reuters found numerous coins and stamps from that era available for sale, including some bearing the image of Adolf Hitler or Nazi swastikas.

Clicking on some of the Confederate flags and related items on Amazon's website took users to an error page.""Is this a big sacrifice for retailers? No. But, symbolically, it's a good step,"" said David Satterfield, an executive vice president of G.F. Bunting and Co, a strategic communications firm in California. ""A significant percentage of your consumer base is completely offended by what the flag stands for, and it doesn't make sense carrying it,"" he said.Separately, privately owned Valley Forge Flag, one of the most prominent U.S. flag manufacturers, said on Tuesday it will stop making and selling Confederate flags.In announcing its decision to pull Confederate flags on Tuesday, eBay said the banner had become a ""contemporary symbol of divisiveness and racism."" The website, which carries thousands of items bearing the flag, including clothing, will immediately ban new listings of merchandise and tell sellers of such merchandise that they have to stop. Ebay does not break out sales of individual items sold on its site, but sources said this involves a tiny amount of sales for the company.Analysts said it could take some time for online retailers like eBay to remove merchandise posted by third-party sellers, given the sheer volume of products listed. There are around 800 million listings globally on eBay.E-commerce website Etsy also said it would remove all Confederate flag-related merchandise from its marketplace, which lists handmade and artisanal products.Dollar Tree Inc, Family Dollar Stores Inc, Dollar General and Target Corp said they do not carry any Confederate flag-related merchandise.Juda Engelmayer, a senior vice president of 5W Public Relations in New York, said retailers' decisions to pull the Confederate flag could face some pushback from a small group of consumers, and noted this could have been considered years ago.""This action is probably long overdue, but the retailers' actions are probably going to be received positively,"" he said.

775,"   By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Investors who have the most to win if Amazon, Disney and other consumer discretionary companies continue to push the sector higher are getting increasingly nervous, judging by their options activity.Options bets tied to declines in an exchange-traded fund tracking the sector have been unusually popular, even as the S&P 500 consumer discretionary index has logged an 8 percent rise for the year, handily beating the S&P 500 and turning in the second-best performance among the nine S&P 500 sectors.Earlier in June, the open interest in puts on the consumer discretionary sector ETF touched highs not seen since October 2011. Currently there are two put contracts open for each open call, the most bearish this ratio has been in nine months.Open interest in puts has more than doubled to about 303,000 contracts over the last three months, compared with an 18 percent drop in calls, according to Trade Alert data.    Puts are option contracts that convey the right to sell shares at a predetermined price in the future and are often used to place bearish bets on shares.    But in this case, the surge in puts activity may not be signaling outright bearish sentiment.    “I think it’s more of a hedge,” said Scott Elisha, chief options strategist at Perigon Partners in San Francisco.Elisha was looking in particular at puts betting on the ETF's shares dipping below $75 by mid-July, which at over 90,0000 contracts represents the biggest block of open interest in the ETF's near-term options. The ETF's shares were up 41 cents at $78 on Friday. There are another 82,0000 put contracts open at the $69 and $74 strike prices and these expire in September.“The (ETF's) shares are up about 8 percent this year and with July earnings around the corner, and big names set to report results, it looks like investors might have been picking up some protection,” Elisha said.The ETF touched an all-time high of $78.30 on Wednesday, and the low cost of buying downside protection might be the driving factor behind the increased hedging activity, suggested Susquehanna derivatives strategist Christopher Jacobson. For example, the cost of 3-month 10 percent out-of-the-money XLY puts is now cheaper than it has been 95 percent of the time over the last five years, he said.  The appetite for cheap protection is understandable given that a lot of active managers are overweight the sector, strategists said.Investors taking a longer-term view might also be concerned about the impact from the looming U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate hike.“The sector typically under-performs when the Fed raises rates,” said Jill Carey Hall, equity strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, who is underweight the consumer discretionary sector.The Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade in September. “Investors could just be starting to pay more attention to that,” Hall said.The threat of higher wages putting pressure on margins might also be on investor's minds. A number of big retailers and national chains, including McDonald's - one of the top five constituents of the ETF - have been raising wages of late.""Given that the sector is labor intensive there could be concerns about this hurting margins,"" Hall said.Recent corporate results, however, at two of the ETF's top ten constituents, - Walt Disney Co's and Nike Inc - have been strong, helped by increased consumer spending, and bode well for quarterly results from McDonald's, Amazon.com Inc and Starbucks Corp, due in July.

776,"   By Irene Klotz | CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., June 26  CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., June 26 A U.S. Air Force competition to develop a rocket propulsion system to end dependence on Russian rocket engines drew broad response from companies, the Air Force said on Friday.""There is interest,"" Lt. General Samuel Greaves, who heads the Air Force's Space and Missiles Systems Center, said during a webcast hearing of the House Strategic Forces Subcommittee.Russia's RD-180 engines power the United Launch Alliance (ULA) Atlas 5 rockets that fly most of the military's satellites. The Air Force hopes for at least two public-private partnerships to end reliance on those engines.ULA is a joint venture of Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing. Congress has banned imports of the RD-180 as part of trade sanctions against Russia for its involvement in Ukraine.""We do not have the capability within the United States today to replace (the RD-180) engine, so whatever we come up with will be a new engine,"" Greaves said. The Air Force intends to divide $160 million in seed funds among four companies before the end of 2015. After 12- to 18-month study contracts, two systems would be selected for development. Initial proposals were submitted this week.Part of the military's space launch conundrum could be resolved by the certification last month of privately owned Space Exploration Technologies' (SpaceX) Falcon 9 rocket. About 60 percent of the military's satellites are the right size and mass to fly on Falcon 9, with a heavier lift Falcon that could handle the full lineup of military spacecraft expected to debut this year, SpaceX Senior Director Jeff Thornburg said.SpaceX, owned and operated by technology entrepreneur Elon Musk, and Blue Origin, which is owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, already are working on methane-fueled rocket engines.The Air Force's solicitation also brought proposals from AeroJet Rocketdyne Holdings Inc, which is working on an Atlas 5 engine replacement called the AR1, and from Orbital ATK , which is proposing solid-fuel and liquid propulsion systems, the companies said.Estimates to replace the Atlas rocket engine range from $200 million for an AR1 to $800 million for Blue Origin's BE-4, ULA president and chief executive Tory Bruno said.

778,"   By Kate Holton | LONDON  LONDON One of the three founders of pioneering British online grocery retailer Ocado, which has warehouses but no stores, has taken control of a Silicon Valley-based firm with a similarly unique approach to the exploration for natural resources.Jonathan Faiman made his name in Britain in 2000 when, with no retail experience, he joined two other investment bankers from Goldman Sachs to form the online supermarket which rivals said would never work but is now a common sight on Britain's high streets with its colorful delivery vans.Having left Ocado as a director in 2010, the 46-year-old Faiman has now spent $150 million to buy into and become chairman of NEOS, a private firm that helps to predict which resources lie under the ground by using proprietary systems to analyze both their own and other parties' data. Investors include Goldman Sachs, Bill Gates and venture capital firm Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield and Byers which has also invested in the likes of Amazon and taxi service Uber. ""With NEOS I saw an opportunity that we could provide countries with a good vision of what's under their country,"" Faiman told Reuters in an interview. ""Not only a vision but a value as well. ""This is less risky than Ocado because it's already set up and working but I think that the prize here is a very big one."" The firm, which was founded by an ex-NASA engineer, works to produce a 3D model of the subsurface to help clients in the oil and gas and mining industries make their decisions about where to explore and where to drill.  It is also increasingly looking at working with governments to interpret multiple geological, geophysical and geochemical datasets in the hunt for water and other resources.FRIEND AND FOE  Faiman, who left Goldman at 30 to set up Ocado, said he sees many similarities between the two industries he has worked in, with some of the larger players in the oil and gas industry following the large British supermarkets by failing to acknowledge that things can be done differently.Ocado now has a market value of 2.4 billion pounds ($3.8 billion), although it has struggled to make a profit.He believes NEOS can analyze large areas at a lower cost than more traditional methods such as seismic exploration, meaning the firm has the potential to offer a helping hand to oil firms grappling with the lower oil prices, while also posing a challenge to the exploration sector. ""One similarity is that the incumbents don't value this as an approach,"" he said. ""And that's a big advantage because if they did value it then this wouldn't be an opportunity.""  With around 60 employees, NEOS has previously partnered with ExxonMobil, Shell and others to work in highly explored regions as well as unexplored greenfield locations. It has also worked with countries such as Argentina and Lebanon and is in advanced talks to work in Cyprus. Faiman said NEOS, which is profitable, was valued at $320 million when he invested in it last month.

780,"   By Lawrence Hurley | WASHINGTON, June 27  WASHINGTON, June 27 Big business was on the winning side in the U.S. Supreme Court's two major cases of the year, with hundreds of employers pushing hard in favor of gay marriage and the healthcare industry backing the insurance subsidies available under Obamacare.The court on Thursday rejected a conservative challenge to President Barack Obama's healthcare law on a 6-3 vote and, a day later, ruled 5-4 that gay marriage should be legal nationwide.Both cases were largely seen through the lens of national ideological wars, with liberals backing gay marriage and Obamacare and conservatives opposing them. But the cases could also be seen as pro-business rulings by a court with a reputation as friendly to corporate interests under Chief Justice John Roberts.Unlike in other contexts, such as a series of cases in which the court cut back on class-action lawsuits, business interests aligned themselves with liberal activists for these cases.""This Supreme Court is unquestionably responsive to the views of corporate America. Here, in both the healthcare and marriage cases, those views aligned with a progressive outcome,"" said Doug Kendall, president of the Constitutional Accountability Center, a left-leaning legal activist group.The two major rulings mask the fact that the business-related rulings this year, with one major environmental case due to come on the court's last day on Monday, have been a mixed bag for corporate interests.In one of the biggest business cases, the court on Thursday dealt a blow to lenders and insurers by upholding a legal theory that allows for lawsuits under the Fair Housing Act based on discriminatory impact even when there is no evidence of intentional discrimination. The court did hand wins to business interests in a series of lower-profile rulings, with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the nation's biggest business lobby, on the winning side in 12 of 20 cases in which it filed friend-of-the-court briefs. The Chamber has a policy not to get involved in social issues and did not file briefs on the gay marriage and Obamacare cases.That did not stop business interests from weighing in.A total of 379 businesses and groups representing employers across various sectors signed on to a friend-of-the-court brief backing gay marriage. In the healthcare case, trade groups representing hospitals and health insurance companies filed court papers backing the Obama administration over the healthcare law.In the marriage case, some of the nation's biggest companies, including Procter & Gamble Co, American Airlines Group Inc and Johnson & Johnson, joined the brief urging the court to rule in favor of gay marriage. Wall Street's biggest names, including Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Morgan Stanley, also signed on. THE BUSINESS CASE FOR GAY MARRIAGE The brief stressed the business case for gay marriage, saying inconsistent state laws imposed burdens on companies and that marriage bans can conflict with corporate anti-discrimination and diversity policies. Thomson Reuters Corp, which owns Reuters news, also signed on to the brief. In his majority opinion in the marriage case, Justice Anthony Kennedy, while not citing the employer brief, echoed some of the concerns raised by employers about how same-sex marriage bans meant that gay employees in committed relationships are treated differently from opposite-sex couples on issues such as workers' compensation benefits and health insurance.In the Obamacare ruling, in which the court upheld nationwide tax subsidies essential to the 2010 Affordable Care Act's implementation, Chief Justice John Roberts explained in detail how the law was intended, as he said, to ""improve health insurance markets, not destroy them.""Roberts cited a brief filed by America's Health Insurance Plans, a trade group representing companies such as Aetna Inc and Anthem Inc.The American Hospital Association, which represents more than 5,000 hospitals and other healthcare providers, also signed a brief backing the law. Shares in various hospital operators, including HCA Holdings Inc and Community Health Systems Inc, surged on news of the ruling.Aside from the housing discrimination ruling, other cases that business interests lost included one earlier in June in which the court ruled in favor of a young Muslim woman who wore a head scarf to a job interview at clothing retailer Abercrombie & Fitch and sued when she did not get the job.Among the Chamber-backed causes that prevailed was a May ruling in favor of defense contractor KBR Inc in its legal fight with a former employee who filed a whistleblower suit accusing it of defrauding the U.S. government over water purification work in Iraq.In a business case decided in December, the court ruled for employers over worker compensation, ruling that companies do not have to pay employees for the time they spend undergoing security checks at the end of their shifts in a case involving an Amazon.com Inc warehousing contractor.

781,"   By Nandita Bose | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Amazon.com Inc will launch its business loan program for small sellers later this year in eight more countries including China, where credit is becoming a key factor in competing for new vendors and grabbing market share. Until now, the e-retailer has offered the service only in the United States and Japan. Amazon Lending, founded in 2012, now plans to offer short-term working capital loans in other countries where it operates a third-party, seller-run marketplace business, the head of Amazon Marketplace, Peter Faricy, told Reuters. The countries are Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom. The service is on an invite-only basis and is not open to all sellers on Amazon's platform. Other large retailers including eBay Inc's PayPal and Alibaba Group Holdings, which run third-party marketplaces, are also turning to credit to boost their vendor base.Some lending industry officials who help lenders assess credit risk say these retailers are taking on risky loans because they don't know the shape of the credit market in which the sellers are operating. Small businesses have high failure rates, especially in China and India, added William Black, a former U.S. banking regulator and professor of Economics and Law at the University of Missouri.Amazon said it can safely offer loans based on internal data and because it takes loan payments out of the sales proceeds it pays sellers. PayPal spokesman Josh Criscoe said eBay merchants who use PayPal are eligible for the working capital loans and credit is offered to only those customers that have a strong PayPal sales history. PayPal has provided more than $500 million in capital since September 2013, with an average loan disbursement of $2 million per day.A spokeswoman for Alibaba's financial services arm Ant Financial, which offers these loans, said credit is offered to Taobao, Tmall merchants and other small business owners who meet certain conditions. The company also offers such loans to customers in some countries like the United States and Britain.Since 2011, Ant Financial's Ant Micro Loan programme has issued 400 billion yuan ($64.42 billion) worth of loans, and the non-performing loan ratio is 1.5 percent, the spokeswoman added. Amazon offers three- to six-month loans of $1,000 to $600,000 to help merchants buy inventory. It makes money on interest and takes a cut of all sales on its marketplace, which now account for about 40 percent of total Amazon site sales.Amazon said it has offered hundreds of millions of dollars in loans since 2012, with more than half of its sellers opting for a repeat loan. The company declined to provide specific figures and also did not say how much it plans to lend this year.Amazon's Faricy said the company has become better at understanding the inflection points in a small or medium business where capital can make a difference.     ""We know a lot about our sellers' business and invite only those who we think are in the best position to take capital and grow,"" he said.Faricy said Amazon uses internal algorithms to choose sellers based on the frequency with which they run out of stock, the popularity of their products and their inventory cycles. In China, where Alibaba lends to small businesses, offering such loans is more of a business requirement, analysts said.""Amazon has very little share in China and they haven't been able to break out of that, so this is a very important necessary step for them to be able to grow,"" said Gil Luria, analyst with Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles.In other countries including India, where there is a scramble to expand the online shopping market, small business loans could offer a distinct competitive advantage, Luria said.     MITIGATING RISK  Online lending accounts for about 3 percent of the roughly $1 trillion of outstanding personal and small business loans in the United States.  The default rate for small businesses with credit under a $1 million stood at 1 percent in 2014 but is seen rising to 1.6 percent in 2015, as new lenders with varying ability to assess risk increase lending, according to small business credit ratings provider PayNet.Retailers like Amazon do not have data from sellers about some markets in which they operate, and relying on internal seller company data is not enough, said William Phelan, president of PayNet.Amazon said it has the information it requires to make ""great loan decisions"" because of close relationships with sellers and that it mitigates risk by taking loan payments from proceeds due to sellers for their sales. Sellers interviewed by Reuters and writing on Amazon forums cited interest rates on Amazon loans ranging from 6 percent to 14 percent, in line with loans from banks and business credit cards.Stephan Aarstol, chief executive of Tower Paddle Boards, an Amazon seller, said he has taken four loans from the company starting in March 2014 because of the speed and simplicity of the process. It took him five days to get his first loan.""The problem for a small business owner is not the interest rate, it's the availability of credit ... I can't grow fast enough,"" he said.($1 = 6.2094 Chinese yuan renminbi) (Editing by Peter Henderson and Matthew Lewis)",2015-06-29,AMZN,"Mon Jun 29, 2015 | 11:20am EDT","Exclusive: Amazon to offer loans to sellers in China, 7 other countries",http://www.reuters.com//article/amazon-com-loans-idUSKCN0P90DS20150629?type=companyNews

THE BUSINESS CASE FOR GAY MARRIAGE The brief stressed the business case for gay marriage, saying inconsistent state laws imposed burdens on companies and that marriage bans can conflict with corporate anti-discrimination and diversity policies. Thomson Reuters Corp, which owns Reuters news, also signed on to the brief. In his majority opinion in the marriage case, Justice Anthony Kennedy, while not citing the employer brief, echoed some of the concerns raised by employers about how same-sex marriage bans meant that gay employees in committed relationships are treated differently from opposite-sex couples on issues such as workers' compensation benefits and health insurance.In the Obamacare ruling, in which the court upheld nationwide tax subsidies essential to the 2010 Affordable Care Act's implementation, Chief Justice John Roberts explained in detail how the law was intended, as he said, to ""improve health insurance markets, not destroy them.""Roberts cited a brief filed by America's Health Insurance Plans, a trade group representing companies such as Aetna Inc and Anthem Inc.The American Hospital Association, which represents more than 5,000 hospitals and other healthcare providers, also signed a brief backing the law. Shares in various hospital operators, including HCA Holdings Inc and Community Health Systems Inc, surged on news of the ruling.Aside from the housing discrimination ruling, other cases that business interests lost included one earlier in June in which the court ruled in favor of a young Muslim woman who wore a head scarf to a job interview at clothing retailer Abercrombie & Fitch and sued when she did not get the job.Among the Chamber-backed causes that prevailed was a May ruling in favor of defense contractor KBR Inc in its legal fight with a former employee who filed a whistleblower suit accusing it of defrauding the U.S. government over water purification work in Iraq.In a business case decided in December, the court ruled for employers over worker compensation, ruling that companies do not have to pay employees for the time they spend undergoing security checks at the end of their shifts in a case involving an Amazon.com Inc warehousing contractor.",2015-06-29,AMZN,"Mon Jun 29, 2015 | 7:26am EDT",Big business on winning side in U.S. top court's major rulings,http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-court-business-idUSL2N0ZF0EH20150629?type=companyNews
783,"   By Nandita Bose | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Amazon.com Inc will launch its business loan program for small sellers later this year in eight more countries including China, where credit is becoming a key factor in competing for new vendors and grabbing market share. Until now, the e-retailer has offered the service only in the United States and Japan. Amazon Lending, founded in 2012, now plans to offer short-term working capital loans in other countries where it operates a third-party, seller-run marketplace business, the head of Amazon Marketplace, Peter Faricy, told Reuters. The countries are Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom. The service is on an invite-only basis and is not open to all sellers on Amazon's platform. Other large retailers including eBay Inc's PayPal and Alibaba Group Holdings, which run third-party marketplaces, are also turning to credit to boost their vendor base.Some lending industry officials who help lenders assess credit risk say these retailers are taking on risky loans because they don't know the shape of the credit market in which the sellers are operating. Small businesses have high failure rates, especially in China and India, added William Black, a former U.S. banking regulator and professor of Economics and Law at the University of Missouri.Amazon said it can safely offer loans based on internal data and because it takes loan payments out of the sales proceeds it pays sellers. PayPal spokesman Josh Criscoe said eBay merchants who use PayPal are eligible for the working capital loans and credit is offered to only those customers that have a strong PayPal sales history. PayPal has provided more than $500 million in capital since September 2013, with an average loan disbursement of $2 million per day.A spokeswoman for Alibaba's financial services arm Ant Financial, which offers these loans, said credit is offered to Taobao, Tmall merchants and other small business owners who meet certain conditions. The company also offers such loans to customers in some countries like the United States and Britain.Since 2011, Ant Financial's Ant Micro Loan program has issued 400 billion yuan ($64.42 billion) worth of loans, and the non-performing loan ratio is 1.5 percent, the spokeswoman added. Amazon offers three- to six-month loans of $1,000 to $600,000 to help merchants buy inventory. It makes money on interest and takes a cut of all sales on its marketplace, which now account for about 40 percent of total Amazon site sales.Amazon said it has offered hundreds of millions of dollars in loans since 2012, with more than half of its sellers opting for a repeat loan. The company declined to provide specific figures and also did not say how much it plans to lend this year.Amazon's Faricy said the company has become better at understanding the inflection points in a small or medium business where capital can make a difference.     ""We know a lot about our sellers' business and invite only those who we think are in the best position to take capital and grow,"" he said.Faricy said Amazon uses internal algorithms to choose sellers based on the frequency with which they run out of stock, the popularity of their products and their inventory cycles.In China, where Alibaba lends to small businesses, offering such loans is more of a business requirement, analysts said. ""Amazon has very little share in China and they haven't been able to break out of that, so this is a very important necessary step for them to be able to grow,"" said Gil Luria, analyst with Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles.In other countries including India, where there is a scramble to expand the online shopping market, small business loans could offer a distinct competitive advantage, Luria said.         MITIGATING RISK     Online lending accounts for about 3 percent of the roughly $1 trillion of outstanding personal and small business loans in the United States.  The default rate for small businesses with credit under a $1 million stood at 1 percent in 2014 but is seen rising to 1.6 percent in 2015, as new lenders with varying ability to assess risk increase lending, according to small business credit ratings provider PayNet.    Retailers like Amazon do not have data from sellers about some markets in which they operate, and relying on internal seller company data is not enough, said William Phelan, president of PayNet.Amazon said it has the information it requires to make ""great loan decisions"" because of close relationships with sellers and that it mitigates risk by taking loan payments from proceeds due to sellers for their sales. Sellers interviewed by Reuters and writing on Amazon forums cited interest rates on Amazon loans ranging from 6 percent to 14 percent, in line with loans from banks and business credit cards.Stephan Aarstol, chief executive of Tower Paddle Boards, an Amazon seller, said he has taken four loans from the company starting in March 2014 because of the speed and simplicity of the process. It took him five days to get his first loan.   ""The problem for a small business owner is not the interest rate, it's the availability of credit ... I can't grow fast enough,"" he said.($1 = 6.2094 Chinese yuan renminbi) (Reporting by Nandita Bose in Chicago; Editing by Peter Henderson and Matthew Lewis)",2015-06-29,AMZN,"Mon Jun 29, 2015 | 6:01am EDT","Amazon to offer loans to sellers in China, 7 other countries",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-amazon-com-loans-exclusive-idUSKCN0P90DW20150629?type=companyNews

Since Monday, many Greeks have found they can no longer make payments online to such companies. ""I tried to pay Facebook three euros for a small advertisement but my card was rejected right away,"" said Greek e-commerce consultant Panayotis Gezerlis.He added that he had also failed to purchase music from Google and to make a payment from his bank card via eBay's (EBAY.O) payment unit, Paypal.Google told Greek clients in a Facebook posting that it was working to find a solution.

794,"  (Adds plaintiff lawyer comment, background)By Dan LevineSAN FRANCISCO, July 6 Amazon.com Inc  must face a trademark lawsuit brought by a watchmaker which says the online retailer's search results can cause confusion for potential customers, a federal appeals court ruled.The 2-1 opinion from the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco on Monday reversed a lower court ruling, and said high-end watchmaker Multi Time Machine Inc. is entitled to a trial on its trademark allegations.An Amazon representative could not immediately be reached for comment. MTM Special Ops are a military style model of watches which are not sold on Amazon's web site, according to the court ruling. If an Amazon shopper searches for it, however, Amazon the site will not say it does not carry MTM products.Instead, Amazon displays MTM Special Ops in the search field and immediately below the search field, along with similar watches manufactured by MTM's competitors for sale.MTM alleged this could cause customers to buy from one of those competitors, rather than encouraging the shopper to look for MTM watches elsewhere. MTM sued, and a Los Angeles federal judge resolved the trademark claims in favor of Amazon before trial. In its ruling on Monday, the 9th Circuit said MTM's lawsuit should be allowed to proceed.""We think a jury could find that Amazon has created a likelihood of confusion,"" the court wrote.

Three energy firms - Perenco Ltd, Pluspetrol and Pacific Rubiales Energy - have signaled interest in bidding for the oil block.""The presentation of the bids has been delayed at the request of the bidders because they need a few more days to conclude their economic evaluation (of the block),"" said Luis Ortigas, the head of state energy regulator Perupetro. ""I calculate that in a couple of weeks we'll be ready to continue with the process,"" said Ortigas.The winning bid was originally expected to be announced on July 15. Ortigas previously said that the winning bid would combine the most favorable financial incentives as well as the largest number of planned exploratory and development wells.Perupetro has estimated that in its first 10 years of operation at the block, the new operator will invest a minimum of $550 million to develop it.Indigenous communities in block 192 have held several protests over pollution, proceeds and land use in recent years - at times halting output.

Sellers who use Amazon's fulfillment services reported a 300 percent rise in unit sales, with one vendor saying he made $16,000 per hour.Green smoothie mixes were among the highest-selling items in Japan, while Canadians used the day to stock up on Huggies diapers, and the Monopoly board game was France's favorite  product, Amazon said. On the downside, the company came in for criticism on social media, with some customers disappointed by the speed at which offers ended and the lack of blockbuster discounts.

Goldman fell 1.2 percent after posting its smallest quarterly profit in nearly four years, while UnitedHealth fell 0.5 percent after missing Wall Street's cost estimates.Netflix rose 16.9 percent to a record high of $114.72, a day after reporting strong subscribers numbers. Amazon rose 2.5 percent also to an all-time high of $472.79 after reporting record sales on its Prime Day. The two stocks propelled the Nasdaq 100 to a record high.

809,"   By Nandita Bose and Mari Saito | CHICAGO/SAN FRANCISCO  CHICAGO/SAN FRANCISCO Macy's Inc (M.N) is expanding same-day delivery to several new U.S. markets this summer, one of the most aggressive pushes by a brick-and-mortar retailer in an area dominated by e-commerce giant Amazon (AMZN.O), according to a Macy's official.    Macy's, the nation's largest department store chain, already offers same-day delivery services in eight markets. By partnering with Deliv, an Uber-like startup that uses a fleet of contract drivers to pick up online orders from stores and malls,  the retailer has found a cost-effective way to expand, said the Macy's official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.      The official said that the initial plan is to offer the service in several more markets but there nay be additions later this year, and that could take it ahead of Amazon – which currently offers same-day delivery in 14 markets. Currently, Macy's is offering the service in Houston, San Francisco, San Jose, Seattle, Washington D.C., Chicago, Los Angeles and New Jersey. It couldn't be immediately ascertained which ones were being added.    The department store company's efforts come as the ""last mile"" - the final portion of a package's journey that takes it from a retailer's warehouse or store to the customer's front door - becomes the next battleground for retailers trying to increase online sales. Macy's has one possible advantage over Amazon in that it has 886 stores as of May 2 in the U.S. from which to source products for delivery – meaning the packages often have less distance to travel - against 50 fulfilment centers and smaller distribution facilities run by Amazon.    But fast shipping is costly and most retailers who offer it currently lose money on the service, warn logistics experts. For example, analysts estimate that Amazon loses $1 billion to $2 billion a year on its U.S. Prime service, which promises delivery within anything from one hour to two days. Amazon's net shipping cost rose to $4.2 billion in 2014, up from $3.5 billion a year earlier. Macy's spokesman Jim Sluzewski confirmed the retailer's plans to expand the service this year but declined to give further details.Faster delivery also becomes a differentiating factor when new online retail sites like Jet.com, which launched on Tuesday,  promise to offer cheaper prices than Amazon. The startup, which will charge $49 a year for membership, claims its consumers can get the lowest price on anything they buy online, with the trade-off of being relatively slow delivery service.              ""RACE TO THE BOTTOM""      Even as Macy's rushes to extend fast delivery, many other traditional retailers are far more cautious. The costs of same-day delivery and ambivalence from many customers remain concerns, analysts say.    Nordstrom Inc (JWN.N) has offered same-day delivery for $15 since 2011, but the service is still only available in three markets: Seattle and Bellevue in Washington state, and La Jolla in California.    A January survey of 5,118 online shoppers by UPS and Comscore found that 85 percent of people surveyed were willing to wait five days or more for their delivery.         ""The thing that's so perplexing about this last mile and same day is that the consumers overwhelmingly prefer free shipping over speed,"" said Satish Jindel, a logistics consultant and president of SJ Consulting Group.     That could change, said David Bell, a professor of marketing at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, and if consumers became accustomed to same-day service, the result would be an expensive ""race to the bottom for retailers"" who would not be able to compete with Amazon on the delivery cost.     Macy's does not disclose how many items it has available for same-day delivery, and Deliv will not say how many items it carries for Macy's.     Amazon has more than a million products available for same-day delivery. Macy's charges its customers $5 for same-day delivery, but it is unclear how much of its costs that covers. Deliv says its rates for retailers are in line with the average $8 ground delivery cost of carriers such as UPS and FedEx, but it was unclear whether that's what it charges Macy's or whether it takes a loss to offer the service to Macy's.""It's very hard to compete with Amazon, but traditional retailers have an advantage in that they already have all of their inventory in place five miles from 90 percent of their purchasing population at their stores,"" said Deliv CEO Daphne Carmeli.""This is one of those opportunities to out-Amazon Amazon,"" she said.    Although Macy's does not break out details of its online sales or shipping costs, analysts assume the company is losing money on the service once additional costs are taken into account, including finding the product, getting the package ready for delivery, and restocking expenses.    ""Only the biggest of retailers that are capable will be able to afford these operations,"" said Jarrett Streebin, the CEO of EasyPost, a shipping startup. He estimated costs per package could reach $20 or more with additional logistics processes and staffing to handle the orders. ""Who's willing to pay the bill?"" he asked. (Editing by Stephen R.

822,"   By Chuck Mikolajczak | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Amazon.com founder and Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos got a lot richer while he slept on Thursday night, after the company reported its quarterly earnings and its shares rose 20.1 percent.The stock jump added $8 billion to Bezos' net worth as the market opened on Friday, but by the time the market closed, he had given back roughly half of that gain. The shares, which had briefly hit a record high of $580.57 overnight, closed at $529.42.It is all in a day's work - or a night's sleep - for Bezos, who owned 83.92 million shares, or roughly 18 percent of Amazon's outstanding stock of May 14. His stake easily dwarfs those of other insiders. Diego Piacentini, senior vice president of international consumer business, is the second-largest insider holder behind Bezos, with 110,000 shares. Jeffrey Wilke, senior VP of consumer business, owns 80,000 shares. The stake held by Bezos would hold a market cap of about $48.6 billion on its own, which is bigger than S&P 500 names such as FedEx Corp, Caterpillar Inc and Netflix Inc. It is more than 18 times more than the smallest company in the S&P 500 by market cap, Joy Global Inc. It is too soon to tell whether Bezos was up overnight selling some of his highest-priced shares, but an examination of his filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission show he has been slowly cutting his stake, mainly by donating stock to charity. He owns roughly 5 percent fewer shares now than his 88.1 million as of Aug. 1, 2011.  Amazon declined to comment.

823,"   By Eileen Soreng  Amazon.com Inc's shares surged more than 20 percent in early trading on Friday, adding more than $46 billion to the company's market value, after strong growth in the e-commerce giant's cloud business drove a surprise quarterly profit.The company's market capitalization soared to more than $270 billion, overtaking that of Wal-Mart Stores, the world's biggest retailer. Revenue from Amazon's cloud operations - Amazon Web Services (AWS) - nearly doubled in the second quarter, indicating that the business was poised to drive sustainable earnings for the online retailer, Wall Street analysts said.Operating margins at the unit jumped to 21.4 pct from 7.7 percent.""Product sales are Amazon's bread, but AWS is its butter,"" Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter said in a note, raising his price target on the stock by 21 percent to $700.""They delivered a pretty large profit, we expected a loss ... they exercised discipline and did not invest in new consumer electronic product launches."" The company drew investor ire last year for spending too much after its Fire Phone and Fire TV failed to excite consumers.Morgan Stanley raised its price target to $740 - the highest on the stock - implying a 53 percent increase from Thursday's close of $482.18. The stock touched a high of $580.57 on Friday.At least 24 brokerages raised their target price. The median target price on the stock is $645.50. Of the 43 analysts covering the stock, 34 have ""buy"" or higher ratings, according to Thomson Reuters data.Investors have raised concerns that the company's aggressive spending may not pay off. But strong growth in AWS and positive commentary on the Amazon Prime service allayed some worries.Amazon Prime members, who pay $99 a year for speedier delivery and exclusive access to certain movies, music and Kindle books, tend to spend more than regular users of Amazon's services. ""The scale of their distribution network is starting to generate better incremental margins,"" Barclays analyst Paul Vogel said.""That, coupled with the continued strong growth in both revenue and margins at AWS, moves us from cautious to optimistic on the next year of growth for Amazon.""Amazon, which last reported a profit in the fourth quarter of 2014, considers AWS its main engine of growth, along with Amazon Prime and Marketplace, where the company acts as a middleman for third-party vendors.Amazon broke out AWS revenue and income for the first time in the first quarter.

The shares, which had briefly hit a record high of $580.57 overnight, closed at $529.42.

It is too soon to tell whether Bezos was up overnight selling some of his highest-priced shares, but an examination of his filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission show he has been slowly cutting his stake, mainly by donating stock to charity.

827,"  Amazon's stock price surge into Friday made it the latest of a series of companies to boom following results, and its performance this year, along with a few others, has basically kept the S&P 500 above water. Data from S&P Dow Jones Indices shows that the gains in Amazon (AMZN.O), Facebook (FB.O), Google (GOOGL.O) and Netflix (NFLX.O) account for more than 50 percent of the broad S&P 500's rise of just over 1 percent so far in 2015. Add in Apple (AAPL.O), and those five companies account for nearly 60 percent of the year's gains, according to S&P index analyst Howard Silverblatt. Internal measures show fewer stocks are driving the market's gains, something that has happened in the past when equities were nearing a peak. The year so far has been bifurcated between big winners and big losers, with 35 stocks in the S&P up at least 25 percent this year, and 28 down that much. ""It's not a matter of a rising tide lifting all boats,"" said Silverblatt. ""It's every boat for themselves.""

835,"  SAN FRANCISCO, July 28 Amazon.com Inc  launched a new platform on Tuesday that will help startups advertise and distribute their products directly to millions of Amazon customers, filling an important gap for entrepreneurs trying to reach a wider market of consumers.The online retailer is partnering with more than 25 crowd-funding platforms like Indiegogo and venture capital firms to offer 200 products on the platform, which is called ""Amazon Launchpad."" Amazon said it is not working with Kickstarter in ""any official capacity"" for its program.Some of the products are already availalbe on Amazon.com, but the program will be listed on Amazon's Launchpad store.     Amazon will manage inventory, fulfill orders using its own distribution network and provide customer service for a margin of the startup's sales.An increasing number of startups are tapping crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter to line up financing for everything from new films to gadgets, but it is also an area fraught with challenges. Entrepreneurs can attract massive interest in a new gadget through crowdfunding sites, but often find it difficult to actually market and distribute orders on time to a large number of consumers.""As the pace of innovation continues to increase within the startup community, we want to help customers discover these unique products and learn the inspiration behind them,"" said Jim Adkins, vice president of Amazon in a statement. ""We also know from talking to startups that bringing a new product to market successfully can be just as challenging as building it."" The company will also help companies expand globally when startups are ready to ship products to consumers outside the United States. Startups will also be able to offer their gadgets to members of Amazon Prime, the retailer's popular $99-year subscription service.""Before Launchpad I thought we would have to go directly to consumers and begin talking to retailers, but we leapfrogged that phase,"" said Jake Levine, the founder and CEO of Electric Objects, a startup based in New York that sells Internet-connected screens that can display thousands of different artwork on the wall. The startup launched a Kickstarter campaign last July that raised nearly $800,000.""The fact that I can go from zero to Amazon Prime is unprecedented,"" said Levine.

836,"  BEIJING China's Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N) said on Wednesday it would invest $1 billion into its Aliyun cloud computing arm to challenge Amazon.com Inc's (AMZN.O) lucrative Web Services division, opening a global front in the battle between the two e-commerce giants.With the global cloud computing market estimated by analysts to be worth about $20 billion, Alibaba said in a statement the investment would go toward setting up new Aliyun data centers in the Middle East, Singapore, Japan and Europe. The firm also plans to strike business partnerships with telecom and enterprise technology providers in those regions.Although Alibaba and Amazon have so far avoided competing directly in their core business of e-commerce outside China, Aliyun's international expansion takes aim squarely at Amazon Web Services (AWS), an increasingly central and profitable division of the Seattle-based company. Amazon shares soared last week after the company reported, among other items, an 81 percent revenue increase for AWS, which hosts Web customers like Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) and Airbnb.Simon Hu, the president of Aliyun and former head of Alibaba's microfinance arm, said in an interview that Aliyun had focused on the Chinese market in its first six years but has now attained the technological maturity to challenge U.S. cloud players like AWS, Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and IBM Corp (IBM.N). ""Our goal is to overtake Amazon in four years, whether that's in customers, technology, or worldwide scale,"" Hu said. ""Amazon, Microsoft and others have already laid the groundwork for us by educating the markets about cloud in the U.S. and Europe, so we have an even better opportunity to join in the competition.""As it expands, Aliyun will face stiff competition from some of the biggest names in technology. Amazon led the global cloud infrastructure market with a 28 percent share in 2014, trailed by Microsoft, IBM and Google Inc (GOOGL.O) at 10, 7 and 5 percent, respectively, according to Synergy Research Group.After Amazon made a limited ""beta"" entry into China last year, where cloud adoption rates by businesses are far lower than in the rest of the world, Aliyun opened a data center in Silicon Valley in March to serve U.S. customers.

837,"  (Removes reference to investment timeframe in 1st paragraph)BEIJING, July 29 China's Alibaba Group Holding Ltd said on Wednesday it would invest $1 billion into its Aliyun cloud computing arm to challenge Amazon.com Inc's  lucrative Web Services division, opening a global front in the battle between the two e-commerce giants.With the global cloud computing market estimated by analysts to be worth about $20 billion, Alibaba said in a statement the investment would go toward setting up new Aliyun data centres in the Middle East, Singapore, Japan and Europe. The firm also plans to strike business partnerships with telecom and enterprise technology providers in those regions.Although Alibaba and Amazon have so far avoided competing directly in their core business of e-commerce outside China, Aliyun's international expansion takes aim squarely at Amazon Web Services (AWS), an increasingly central and profitable division of the Seattle-based company.Amazon shares soared last week after the company reported, among other items, an 81 percent revenue increase for AWS, which hosts Web customers like Netflix Inc and Airbnb. Simon Hu, the president of Aliyun and former head of Alibaba's microfinance arm, said in an interview that Aliyun had focused on the Chinese market in its first six years but has now attained the technological maturity to challenge U.S. cloud players like AWS, Microsoft Corp and IBM Corp.""Our goal is to overtake Amazon in four years, whether that's in customers, technology, or worldwide scale,"" Hu said. ""Amazon, Microsoft and others have already laid the groundwork for us by educating the markets about cloud in the U.S. and Europe, so we have an even better opportunity to join in the competition."" As it expands, Aliyun will face stiff competition from some of the biggest names in technology. Amazon led the global cloud infrastructure market with a 28 percent share in 2014, trailed by Microsoft, IBM and Google Inc at 10, 7 and 5 percent, respectively, according to Synergy Research Group.After Amazon made a limited ""beta"" entry into China last year, where cloud adoption rates by businesses are far lower than in the rest of the world, Aliyun opened a data centre in Silicon Valley in March to serve U.S. customers. Although Amazon counts some of the largest companies on the Internet among its 1 million customers, Aliyun says it has amassed 1.4 million customers - amounting to over 20 percent market share in China - largely thanks to the countless Chinese sellers who host their online storefronts with Alibaba.Aliyun also said Wednesday it had teamed up with Chinese enterprise software provider Yonyou to offer cloud infrastructure services to Yonyou's customers.Hu said the partnership would help promote cloud adoption in China, which had considerable room for growth as the government continues its campaign to digitise Chinese industry.(Reporting by Gerry Shih and Paul Carsten; Editing by Kennethh Maxwell)",2015-07-29,AMZN,"Wed Jul 29, 2015 | 5:26am EDT",CORRECTED-Alibaba cloud unit sets sights on Amazon in $1 billion global push,http://www.reuters.com//article/alibaba-cloud-idUSL1N1090C220150729?type=companyNews

840,"  (Adds executive's comments, company background, share price)By Stephen EisenhammerRIO DE JANEIRO, July 30 Vale SA, the world's biggest iron ore producer, returned to profit in the second quarter, bolstered by higher output and cost cuts as it kept up pressure on Australian rivals in its fight for market share.But as the Brazilian miner battles to increase margins, Vale said iron ore production next year will likely be less than the 376 million tonnes it had previously forecast.""Probably we'll be between the guidance we gave... and the 340 million tonnes we are producing in 2015,"" iron ore chief Peter Poppinga told analysts on a conference call, adding the company was phasing out higher-cost production.Vale overcame a slump in iron ore prices to report a net profit of $1.68 billion on Thursday, moving into the black for the first time in a year. That was a jump of 17.3 percent from the same quarter a year ago, and more than four times the average forecast of $408 million of six analysts in a Reuters poll. The performance ""shows the company is prepared for the challenging commodities scenario,"" Chief Financial Officer Luciano Siani said.A big part of the improved result was a reduction in cash costs, with Vale lowering its cost of producing a tonne of iron ore to $15.8 per tonne, from $18.3 per tonne in the first quarter. With the iron ore price .IO62-CNI=SI about half of its year-ago level, mining companies have focused on reducing costs to survive the slump.For Vale, one of the lowest-cost producers of the steelmaking raw material alongside Australia's Rio Tinto  and BHP Billiton, the result was a welcome boost after a string of quarterly losses.""Management is delivering on its promises,"" Citigroup analysts Alexander Hacking and Thiago Ojea said in a note. The results come a week after the Rio de Janeiro-based company announced record mine output for the second quarter.Crucially, Vale said its realized price, a measure of how much it earned on ore sales, rose to $50.6 per tonne, from $46 per tonne in the first quarter.The company also sold a stake in its subsidiary MBR for 4 billion reais ($1.2 billion), helping to cover a cash shortfall as Vale invests in a new iron ore mine in the Amazon, the largest project in its history.Vale shares rose as much as 5 percent but pared gains to trade up 0.3 percent at 15.16 reais at midday.

845,"   By David Randall | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Forget Amazon and its out-of-this-world share price. Instead, U.S. mutual fund managers are turning to small-scale shipping companies such as Stamps.com Inc and Pitney Bowes Inc as a backdoor way into the growing $334 billion e-commerce market. Funds from firms including T. Rowe Price, Lord Abbett and Royce Capital were among the 28 that added Stamps.com to their portfolio in their most recent quarter, a 250 percent jump from the quarter before, according to Morningstar. Competitor Pitney Bowes, founded in 1920, saw the number of funds adding shares of the company to their portfolios jump by 30 percent over the same time.Portfolio managers say that they are attracted to e-commerce suppliers not only because of the growth of Amazon and smaller scale businesses like the eBay and Etsy stores of the world, but because of the decline of the U.S. Postal Service. Package volume rose 14.4 percent in the Postal Service's second quarter, while standard mail dropped 2.1 percent. After a round of acquisitions by both companies over the last 12 months, Stamps.com and Pitney Bowes are the largest firms licensed by the Postal Service to create and print official postage at home, making themselves the most likely alternative should the Postal Service follow through on its plan to cut some rural locations. Both firms sell stamps at marked-up rates, and also provide customers ways to ship via FedEx, United Parcel Service and other firms. With the likely pullback in Postal Service branches and the company's 2014 acquisition of web-based shipping software company ShipStation, ""I think Stamps.com is better positioned than they've ever been,"" said Jim Harvey, a portfolio manager at Royce Funds who has owned shares of the company on and off since its initial public offering in 1999 and added the company back to his portfolio earlier this year.Stamps.com is not without risks, of course, the chief being its reliance on Amazon. While the company does not disclose the amount of revenue that comes from Amazon-related business, analysts say that it is a significant portion of its sales. Its record results in the first quarter helped spark a 46 percent rally in the share price for the year to date, leaving it trading at 41 times earnings, approximately double the multiple of the Standard & Poor's 500 index.  Amazon, by comparison, is up 71 percent over the same time, and doesn't have a positive price to earnings multiple over the last 12 months because it hasn't been profitable during that period. Amazon closed at $537.01 Wednesday, and is up 73 percent for the year to date.     BROAD PUSH INTO E-COMMERCE       It's not only Amazon driving the expansion of e-commerce. Hoboken, New Jersey-based startup Jet.com, launched in July by the former founder of Diapers.com, aims to take on Amazon by undercutting the company by shipping from local merchants. Macy's Inc, meanwhile, is expanding its same-day delivery service currently available in cities including San Francisco and Chicago to other major markets. Market research firm Forrester Research estimates that e-commerce, currently making up 10 percent of all sales in the U.S., will expand by some 43 percent to $480 billion within five years, and funds are picking up other companies connected to business, even as some share prices decline.  Sonoco Products Co and International Paper Co, two of the largest cardboard box makers in the US, each saw the number of funds adding the companies to their portfolios for the first time jump by 20 percent or more last quarter, according to Morningstar. Shares of Sonoco Products, which trade at a below-market price to earnings ratio of 15.4, are down 5.4 percent for the year to date. Shares of International Paper, which at a P/E of 21 trade slightly above the market average, are down 10.6 percent, in part because of the global sell-off in commodity-related companies. Shares of Pitney Bowes have fallen 16 percent over the same time, largely on account of the fact that revenue in its growing e-commerce business did not make up for a decline in its postage metering segment typically used by businesses to send out monthly bills to customers. The declines in Pitney Bowes, and its inexpensive P/E multiple of 10.4, prompted Bryant VanCronkhite, portfolio manager of the $2 billion Wells Fargo Advantage Special Mid Cap Value fund, to add shares of the company earlier this year.  ""The market is very focused on the one issue of their secular declining mail business, and ignoring the fact that they are investing"" to expand beyond their traditional postage metering business, he said. In May, Pitney Bowes acquired Borderfree Inc, which helps retailers with international shopping services like receiving payments in several currencies and customs clearing, for $395 million, a premium of more than double the value of the company. The price was worth it, VanCronkhite said, because it gives the company a way to ""service everything from an Etsy store to a global retail business."" ""This company is in the middle of a three year turnaround plan, and it's moving more of its operations to the digital side of the business, which is where the economy is going, too,"" he added.       (Reporting by David Randall; editing by Linda Stern and John Pickering)",2015-08-06,AMZN,"Thu Aug 6, 2015 | 2:06pm EDT",Growth of ecommerce pushes funds into small-fry shipping firms,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-funds-shipping-analysis-idUSKCN0QB1W920150806?type=companyNews

Firms in the digital sphere oppose being included in the law's scope.""We're pleased to see digital service platforms subject to a different regime but we're disappointed at the lack of recognition that it is the use of cloud that determines the security risk not the service itself,"" said Chris Gow, Senior Manager, Government Affairs at Cisco.The European Commission -- the EU executive -- and some member states reckon that because of the widespread use of Internet services and the number of businesses that rely on the web they should also be subject to security rules and reporting requirements.Currently there is no pan-European cybersecurity law and only telecoms operators are subject to the incident-reporting requirements.

849,"  * Facility to be set up in western Maharashtra state* Foxconn looking for local partners for the facility   (Adds comments from Foxconn founder, chief minister, details)By Devidutta TripathyMUMBAI, Aug 8 Taiwan's Foxconn, the world's largest contract electronics manufacturer and a key supplier to Apple Inc, on Saturday signed a pact with India's Maharashtra state to invest $5 billion over five years on a new electronics manufacturing facility.The announcement was made by Foxconn founder Terry Gou and Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis after the signing of an accord in the state capital Mumbai. The Foxconn announcement will bolster Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ""Make in India"" campaign, which aims to turn Asia's third-largest economy into a manufacturing powerhouse.Gou said Foxconn, the trade name for Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd which also counts Blackberry, Xiaomi and Amazon as clients, was looking for local partners for the facility in the western Indian state.He declined to say if the Taiwan-based company would make mobile phones at the facility. India could help Foxconn mitigate accelerating wage inflation in China, where it makes the majority of iPhones, and base production sites closer to markets where its key clients want to grow.On Tuesday, Gou said in New Delhi that he was looking at setting up manufacturing units in various Indian states and possible partnerships in the world's fastest growing smartphone market. He had said in May that Foxconn was aiming to develop 10-12 facilities in India, including factories and data centres, by 2020. Local businessmen are hoping that as Foxconn and other companies invest in the country, suppliers will follow.Chief minister Fadnavis said the Foxconn plant would generate employment for about 50,000 people.Foxconn employs about 1.3 million people during peak production times, making it one of the largest private employers in the world. But it has had to improve labour conditions following a series of suicides in 2010-2011, mostly at its Shenzhen manufacturing operation.The company on Friday confirmed the death of an employee at its Zhengzhou plant in China which a labour group said was suicide.

854,"   By Alina Selyukh | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Aug 11 This year, Jonathan Johnson is a man with two political missions.In his home state of Utah, the Overstock.com Inc  chairman is preparing a 2016 bid to replace a popular governor.In Washington DC, his online retailer has emerged as the only company to back both of two competing proposals in Congress for the best way to tax online sales.How web purchases should be taxed has been a top policy priority for Overstock as U.S. states push to require Internet  sellers to start collecting sales tax. Under present U.S. law, online shoppers are supposed to report purchases and pay taxes on them, but few do as the requirement is tough to enforce.Overstock and other retailers have lobbied for the federal government to simplify the multitude of state laws, arguing they burden online sellers with compliance and litigation costs.Johnson's call for federal help on tax is in contrast with his personal campaign to oust Utah Governor Gary Herbert in next year's elections.A Republican who favors small government, Johnson says that as governor, he would curb Utah's wasteful spending and its unnecessary reliance on the federal government, particularly for stewardship of two-thirds of the state's lands. But on the issue of Internet sales taxes, Johson notes that the Constitution expressly grants Congress the authority to regulate interstate commerce, and says if lawmakers set new rules, Overstock should be part of the negotiation.""We've gone from not wanting a federal solution to realizing there's a patchwork of laws that just makes it hard to do business,"" he said in an interview, adding that if a bad bill passed, ""it's an existential risk to the company.""The debate over sales taxes on online purchases has raged in Washington for two decades. The National Conference of State Legislatures estimated in 2012 that states lose some $23 billion every year from uncollected sales taxes. Some states have passed their own laws, requiring online retailers to begin collecting sales and prompting a pushback from Amazon.com Inc, Overstock and others. Overstock has led or supported lawsuits against at least three states and tried to take its case against New York to the Supreme Court.RIVAL PROPOSALS Overstock now supports rival legislative proposals from Utah's own Representative Jason Chaffetz and from Virginia Representative, and Judiciary Committee chairman, Bob Goodlatte. Broadly, Chaffetz wants web sellers to collect tax based on the buyer's location; Goodlatte, based on the location of the seller.To Overstock, both solutions satisfy the need for a simpler, uniform system. ""We're betting on two horses,"" Johnson said. ""Whichever horse wins, we think we win.""Informally, Johnson even suggests a ""third way"" solution, perhaps marrying the two proposals to tax online purchases based on each state's uniform tax rate, but collecting and remitting to the seller's state.Amazon, ""bricks-and-mortar"" stores like Wal-Mart Stores Inc  and states back Chaffetz's bill, saying it would eliminate the tangle of state laws and put online and physical stores on the same level.Online marketplaces like eBay Inc and Etsy Inc , online startups and conservative advocacy groups oppose it, worried about the burden of collecting taxes at different rates or facing audits from multiple states.The prospects of Chaffetz's bill or Goodlatte's discussion draft in the current Congress are unclear.

855,"  (Recasts to focus on mine stoppage, adds Vale comment)RIO DE JANEIRO Aug 14 Vale SA stopped operations at its Onça Puma nickel mine in Brazil's Amazon after a Brazilian federal court on Friday ordered the halt because of disputed payments to indigenous communities.Vale's operations in Pará face regular legal and protest action by native Brazilian groups seeking better schools, health care and other public services.Onça Puma, in Ourilândia do Norte, is part of a complex of mines operated by Vale in the state's Carajas region. The mine produced 5,900 tonnes of finished nickel in the second quarter, or about 8.8 percent of Vale's finished-nickel output.The most common protest by indigenous groups has involved blocking Vale's rail line between Carajas and the Atlantic Ocean. As part of its ruling, the court ordered Vale, the world's second-largest nickel producer, to deposit 1 million reais ($287,000) for each indigenous village in the area until it establishes a compensation program for the communities.Vale said in a statement that it is duly licensed to operate the Onça Puma mine, but that it has run into difficulty completing a study of the indigenous lands approved by Brazil's FUNAI Indian agency. Vale also said it faces difficulty implementing its approved basic environmental plan in indigenous areas because the native peoples are blocking access to their lands unless Vale agrees to make cash payments to their groups.The license requires Vale to work with the native groups to establish mitigation measures on indigenous lands for potential environmental problems that the mine might cause, but it does not require that Vale make direct cash payments to the communities in order to carry out that work, Vale added. Vale officials have long complained that despite working closely with native groups and supporting cultural and social projects, they are being asked by indigenous peoples to finance services that are properly the responsibility of Brazil's federal and state governments, not Vale.Vale said it will challenge the ruling in order to restart operations.Nickel, a metal that is both hard and malleable, is used primarily to make steel and other alloys rust resistant. Rio de Janeiro-based Vale is also the largest producer of iron ore, the main ingredient in steel.

856,"  * To spend at least $8.5 bln mainly on OLED through 2018* Aims to secure early lead with OLED push* Market set to grow more than three-fold* OLED TV prices still at least double LCD TVsSEOUL, Aug 17 South Korea's LG Display Co Ltd  said on Monday it would focus investment on organic light-emitting diode (OLED) displays, betting on the next-generation technology to steer it clear of price wars and ahead of the competition. Through 2018, LG Display plans to put at least 10 trillion won ($8.47 billion) primarily into OLED displays for large products such as TVs, and flexible screens for smartphones and wearables. It will seek to expand OLED applications to signage and automobiles, and allocate some spending to premium liquid crystal display (LCD) products, the firm said in a statement.LG Display and sister firm LG Electronics Inc  have been the biggest proponents of OLED, which boasts improved colour rendition and power consumption. The world's top LCD maker hopes early investment in OLED will help it dominate when the technology becomes mainstream. LG Display shares have fallen 34 percent this year, touching levels not seen since 2012 as investors see a future comprising sluggish LCD growth and profit-squeezing price wars with Chinese rivals. OLED, however, offers a market worth $28.3 billion by 2022 from $8.7 billion in 2014, said researcher DisplaySearch.OLED is being increasingly adopted for premium smartphones and smartwatches, such as models from Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  and Apple Inc. But prices of goods sporting large, high profit margin OLED screens such as TVs are still far higher than comparable LCD products. A 55-inch OLED ultra-high definition curved TV made by LG Electronics was on sale for $4,999 on Amazon.com Inc's  U.S. shopping site, marked down from $5,499.99. A comparable LCD set made by Samsung was priced $2,497.99, down from $3,999.99.Samsung, the world's biggest TV maker, has said OLED is still too expensive to produce for TVs.As the two LG companies are the only major players pushing the technology for TVs, analysts and investors are sceptical whether they can by themselves create the economies of scale necessary to bring down prices enough for mass market adoption.

Amazon customers will be able to order food from dozens of restaurants in the Seattle area using the company's Prime Now app - with the delivery service coming at no extra charge. Prime Now, launched last December in New York, promises one and two-hour delivery of tens of thousands of products and the new meal service is another way to add value to Amazon's $99-a year Prime membership program, a core growth area for the company. Analysts estimate that there are more than 40 million Prime members worldwide.The e-commerce company has dabbled in restaurant services in the past, allowing customers to order food through its platform Amazon Local, but those deliveries were handled by the merchants themselves.  Amazon's decision to use its own fleet of drivers to carry out meal deliveries pits it against established players like GrubHub Inc as well as newer rivals like Uber [UBER.UL], which has expanded its own meal delivery service in cities like San Francisco and Austin. Gus Lopez, general manager of Amazon Restaurants, told Reuters customers will be able to order food from restaurants without paying additional service or delivery fees, while restaurants will get access to Amazon's delivery network. Amazon will take a cut of profits from orders received by partner restaurants.  ""We are going to learn a lot from starting in Seattle -  an important part of the customer experience is having a range of selection from quality restaurants,"" said Lopez.

868,"  (Adds details on United Launch Alliance founding, Air Force plans)By Andrea ShalalWASHINGTON, Sept 8 Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings Inc has submitted a $2 billion offer to buy United Launch Alliance (ULA), a spacecraft launch services provider that is a joint venture of Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing Co, according to sources familiar with the matter.Aerojet Rocketdyne board member Warren Lichtenstein, the chairman and chief executive of Steel Partners LLC, approached ULA President Tory Bruno and senior Lockheed and Boeing executives about the bid in early August, the sources said.Aerojet Rocketdyne spokesman Glenn Mahone said the company would not comment on any negotiations that it was involved in with any company. Lockheed declined comment. No immediate comment was available from Boeing. ULA was created in 2005 after nearly two years of negotiations between the two companies, which overcome opposition from the Federal Trade Commission, arguing the venture would result in significant savings.The U.S. Air Force, eager to reintroduce competition to the market, has worked hard in recent years to certify a new competitor, Space Exploration Technologies Corp, or SpaceX, to launch certain military and spy satellites. The Air Force also plans to end certain launch support of about $1 billion a year that it had provided to ULA for years, now that another competitor is available.Aerojet Rocketdyne, which makes rocket engines, had hoped to  adapt its new AR-1 engine for use on ULA's Atlas 5 rocket, replacing the Russian-built RD-180 engine it now uses. But ULA's current plan is to use a new engine being developed by Blue Origin, owned by Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos.One of the sources said the ULA's owners might welcome the unsolicited bid, given increased competition from SpaceX that is likely to cut into ULA's revenues and earnings in coming years.Lockheed and Boeing, wary of declining revenue prospects,  have funded ULA's work on a new rocket only on a quarterly basis, given concerns about ULA's ability to use existing RD-180 engines for military and spy satellite launches.Congress banned the use of the Russian engines for such launches from 2019 after Russia's invasion of the Crimea region of Ukraine.

In recent years, stiff competition from online retailers such as Amazon.com Inc has eaten into sales at Barnes & Noble's bookstores and gutted demand for its Nook e-readers.Despite bold measures to sell a variety of merchandise at its stores - including toys, signed books and craft brewing kits - sales at the company's retail division fell 1.7 percent to $939 million in the quarter ended Aug. 1.Sales at its Nook business fell 22 percent to $54 million. Neil Saunders, chief executive of research firm Conlumino, said Barnes & Noble had failed to replicate its performance in the preceding quarter when it had managed to stem losses.Overall, the company posted a bigger first-quarter loss than a year earlier.""When taken as a whole, the financials paint a picture of a company still struggling to make its business model work,"" Saunders wrote in a note. Comparable retail store sales rose 1.1 percent, driven by merchandise other than books. The company had 647 stores in the United States as of Aug. 1, or 11 fewer than a year earlier.Last month, Barnes & Noble spun off its college books unit to focus more on its retail bookstores and better integrate its Nook business. Sales at the college books division rose 5.7 percent in the quarter.Net loss attributable to Barnes & Noble increased to $34.9 million, or 68 cents per share, from $28.4 million, or 56 cents per share.Revenue fell 1.5 percent to $1.22 billion.Barnes & Noble shares were down 16.6 percent at $13.59 in late morning trading on Wednesday.

ULA was created in 2006 after nearly two years of negotiations between Lockheed and Boeing, which overcome opposition from the Federal Trade Commission by arguing the venture would result in significant savings.The venture has carried out 99 successful launches since its creation, but it has faced mounting political and financial pressures given a decline in expected U.S. government launches, and the rise of a competitor, privately held Space Exploration Technologies Corp, or SpaceX, founded by entrepreneur Elon Musk.

877,"   By Irene Klotz | CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla  CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla (Reuters) – - United Launch Alliance (ULA), the biggest supplier of rockets for the U.S. military, will ramp up rocket engine work with Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) founder Jeff Bezos' space company, the companies said on Thursday.The move comes as ULA, a partnership of Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) and Boeing Co (BA.N), is considering a $2 billion cash buyout offer from Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings (AJRD.N), sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.Aerojet also is developing an alternative engine for ULA's next-generation rocket, called Vulcan.ULA and Bezos' space company, Blue Origin, said last year the companies would jointly develop a liquid natural gas-fueled rocket engine to replace the Russian-made RD-180 engines that currently power ULA's workhorse Atlas 5 booster.  ULA can no longer import the Russian engines for U.S. military launches, the bulk of its business, under a congressional ban enacted in response to Russia's involvement in Ukraine. Aerojet is working on another engine, called the AR1, though its development is at least 16 months behind Blue Origin's BE-4, ULA Chief Executive Tory Bruno said at a congressional hearing in June. ULA has a contract with Aerojet to use the AR1 as a backup if Blue Origin's development program stumbles.  ULA, Lockheed, Boeing and Aerojet have declined to comment about the reported buyout offer. However, on Thursday ULA and Blue Origin said they had agreed to expand the production capabilities of the BE-4, which is targeted to make its debut flight in 2019. ""This new agreement is an important step toward building BE-4s at the production rate needed for the Vulcan launch vehicle,"" Bezos said in a statement. Bezos is scheduled to be in Florida on Tuesday to unveil plans for its own rocket manufacturing plant and launch pad at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, located just south of NASA's Kennedy Space Center. Blue Origin intends to use the BE-4 engine in its rockets as well as sell them to ULA and potentially other customers.

878,"  CHICAGO Target Corp said on Tuesday it has partnered with Instacart Inc to deliver groceries for as little as $3.99 per order, as it overhauls its food business and competes with Amazon.com Inc's grocery delivery service.The discount retailer will launch a pilot to test the offering in its hometown of Minneapolis and customers in some areas will be able to order online for food, pet products and baby items from two Target stores and have them delivered to their homes.Target has been revamping its grocery department after customer complaints about freshness and product quality, and  the business has been a key priority for Chief Executive Brian Cornell. The company's grocery division accounted for more than 20 percent of revenue last year, with approximately $18 billion in sales.The push expands online order options for Target customers, who can get free delivery within five days on a $25 minimum order. At $3.99 per order, Target customers would have to place 75 orders to match the cost of Amazon's annual $299 delivery fee for groceries.   Online groceries are a $10.9 billion industry in the United States, and the market is expected to grow 9.6 percent annually through 2019, according to a December report by market research firm IbisWorld. One of the largest players in the segment is Amazon Fresh, which delivers in Seattle, New York, Philadelphia, and northern and southern California. Target's grocery delivery pilot follows on a recent expansion of its curbside pick-up test, which started in San Francisco. With the partnership, Target joins an increasingly long list of companies using Instacart for last mile delivery, including Whole Foods Market Inc, Costco Wholesale Corp and most recently the H-E-B grocery chain in Texas. Instacart does not hold inventory but picks up orders from the store and brings them to a customer's home in as little as one hour.

879,"  CHICAGO, Sept 15 Target Corp said on Tuesday it has partnered with Instacart Inc to deliver groceries for as little as $3.99 per order, as it overhauls its food business and competes with Amazon.com Inc's grocery delivery service.The discount retailer will launch a pilot to test the offering in its hometown of Minneapolis and customers in some areas will be able to order online for food, pet products and baby items from two Target stores and have them delivered to their homes.Target has been revamping its grocery department after customer complaints about freshness and product quality, and  the business has been a key priority for Chief Executive Brian Cornell. The company's grocery division accounted for more than 20 percent of revenue last year, with approximately $18 billion in sales.The push expands online order options for Target customers, who can get free delivery within five days on a $25 minimum order. At $3.99 per order, Target customers would have to place 75 orders to match the cost of Amazon's annual $299 delivery fee for groceries.Online groceries are a $10.9 billion industry in the United States, and the market is expected to grow 9.6 percent annually through 2019, according to a December report by market research firm IbisWorld. One of the largest players in the segment is Amazon Fresh, which delivers in Seattle, New York, Philadelphia, and northern and southern California. Target's grocery delivery pilot follows on a recent expansion of its curbside pick-up test, which started in San Francisco. With the partnership, Target joins an increasingly long list of companies using Instacart for last mile delivery, including Whole Foods Market Inc, Costco Wholesale Corp  and most recently the H-E-B grocery chain in Texas.Instacart does not hold inventory but picks up orders from the store and brings them to a customer's home in as little as one hour.

880,"   By Irene Klotz | CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., Sept 15  CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., Sept 15 Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is ramping up his investment in commercial space, with plans for a rocket manufacturing plant and launch site in Florida, officials said on Tuesday. ""This is... the evolution of a new commercial space industry in Florida,"" said Frank DiBello, president of Space Florida, a state-backed economic development agency that spearheaded the project.  Bezos' space company, Blue Origin, will spend more than $200 million on the project, which will complete against industry behemoth United Launch Alliance, a partnership of Lockheed Martin and Boeing, as well as privately owned SpaceX, founded and operated by technology entrepreneur Elon Musk.

881,"  (Adds further comments)By Andrea ShalalNATIONAL HARBOR, Md., Sept 16 Boeing Co  on Wednesday said it had rejected an unsolicited bid from Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings Inc for United Launch Alliance, a 50-50 rocket launch venture of Boeing and Lockheed Martin Corp.""The unsolicited proposal for ULA is not something we seriously entertained,"" Boeing spokesman Todd Blecher said.Boeing said it remained committed ""to ULA and its business, and to continued leadership in all aspects of space, as evidenced by the agreement announced last week with Blue Origin,"" a company owned by Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos that is designing the engine for a new rocket being designed by ULA.Lockheed declined comment, saying it did not discuss transactions with other companies.A source familiar with the matter said Lockheed's refusal to comment did not reveal any disagreement between Lockheed and Boeing, and both companies agreed to reject the bid. Aerojet spokesman Glenn Mahone declined comment, saying the company had a policy not to comment on negotiations with other companies until some agreement had been signed.Sources familiar with the matter last week told Reuters that Aerojet board member Warren Lichtenstein, the chairman and chief executive of Steel Partners LLC, submitted a preliminary $2  billion cash offer on behalf of the engine maker in early August.Boeing and Lockheed did not take the bid seriously because it lacked details and the due diligence usually present in more formal offers, sources familiar with the matter said Wednesday. However, Aerojet remains interested in ULA, despite Boeing's public rejection, and is still engaged in discussions about presenting a more formal bid, the sources said.Analysts said the bid was a strategic move by Aerojet to shut out rival Blue Origin, whose new engine is favored by ULA for use in its new Vulcan rocket. ULA has said Blue Origin's engine program is about two years ahead of Aerojet's work on the AR-1 engine, a claim Aerojet disputes.Air Force General John Hyten, commander of Air Force Space Command, said the decision was up to Boeing and Lockheed. ""Our job is to make sure that we have assured access to space. The business side of the house, that's their business, Hyten told Reuters at the Air Force Association conference.Hyten told a news conference later that he saw a far more robust launch industry now than a decade ago when delays in government launches and a dearth of commercial orders prompted Boeing and Lockheed to merge their launch businesses.He said investment by privately-held companies like Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX, and Blue Origin had also changed the dynamic, since they were looking at opportunities with NASA, satellite operators and even in deep space travel.Chris Chadwick, president of Boeing's defense division, said Boeing had not given any serious consideration to the Aerojet bid, and was not looking for other offers.""You look at ULA with 99 consecutive launches without an accident. We're the best in industry. Others are trying to attain the record we have,"" he told reporters at the conference. ""We think we have a real good competitive position, and we're committed for the long term.""

882,"   By David Randall | NEW YORK  NEW YORK The top-performing U.S. large cap growth fund for the year has prospered by betting on companies positioned to benefit should the Federal Reserve raise interest rates for the first time since the 2008 financial crisis. Noah Blackstein, portfolio manager of the $74.1 million Scotia Dynamic U.S. Growth fund, said that a rate hike would ""normalize"" the equity markets and bolster the shares of companies in his portfolio like Tesla Motors Inc and Amazon.com that have been reinvesting in themselves. ""Higher rates in the bond market will get people who need income out of the equity market, and the equity market will start to reward businesses for growth and return on equity. It can't just be about paying dividends and buying back your own stock,"" Blackstein said.Over the last three years, historically low yields of U.S. Treasuries and other bonds have prompted investors to move $13.6 billion into funds that focus on utilities, real estate and telecom companies that pay high dividends, according to Lipper data.  Those sectors have fallen this year, however, as investors price in the likelihood that the Federal Reserve will decide to raise rates at its meeting this week. Shares of utilities companies are down 10.3 percent for the year to date, while the SPDR Dow Jones real estate investment trust index is down 5.7 percent over the same timeframe. Blackstein focuses on finding companies that can ""sustain and expand their growth,"" he said. His largest positions are in cloud-computing companies such as Tableau Software Inc, Palo Alto Networks Inc, and Salesforce.com Inc, a sector which he calls ""undervalued"" because standard accounting practices recognize costs upfront while subscription revenues trickle in, making price to earnings ratios seem high, he said. His fund is up 14.1 percent for the year, the best performance among the 1,687 large-cap growth funds tracked by Morningstar and 16.6 percentage points better than the benchmark Standard & Poor's 500 index. Over the last five years, he has returned an average of 18 percent a year, which places him in the top 1 percent of funds in his category. The fund owns no energy or industrial companies, a long-standing position based on Blackstein's believe that he cannot predict the future price of oil or other commodities. He recently sold out of his position in Starbucks Corp because of concerns about its valuation amid its 39.8 percent rally for the year to date.

""It's incredible and impossible for me to be standing here.""Hamm said playing a character like the secretive Draper for so long had been both a blessing and a curse.""It doesn't come without a cost and a lot of mental and emotional baggage that gets torn through and weighs on you after a while,"" he told reporters backstage.But ""Mad Men,"" a four-time best drama series winner, was shut out of all the other categories and had to be content with just Hamm's Emmy after closing its final season earlier this year. Instead, the 18,000 voters of the Television Academy threw their support behind the HBO medieval fantasy series ""Game of Thrones,"" which was the night's biggest winner with 12 Emmys.The top Emmy prize had always eluded the series, which is based on George R.R. Martin's books about blood-thirsty nobles and warring kingdoms, despite its 20 million viewers in the United States. On Sunday, it also won awards for writing, directing and for supporting actor Peter Dinklage.Backstage, co-creator Dan Weiss said the ""Thrones"" team had known it would take a while to win over the Television Academy. ""We knew there'd be some resistance to the idea that a show set in this genre, as opposed to crime shows or Westerns, could be a serious drama,"" he said. ""(But) we knew if we did our jobs and were fortunate to be blessed with the cast and crew that we have, we'd get there eventually.""DIVERSITY RULES HBO's ""Veep"" ended the five-year Emmy reign of ABC's ""Modern Family"" as best comedy series. Julia Louis-Dreyfus won best comedy actress for the fourth consecutive year for her role as the egotistical President Selina Meyer in the series, while Tony Hale, who plays her bag man, was again named comedy supporting actor.   ""I think we just get better with every season we do, but also she became president so that gave us lots of challenges,"" ""Veep"" creator Armando Ianucci told reporters about the show's rise to the top. ""Everything Selina does now has terrible international impact, so it made everyone raise their game.""On a milestone night for diversity, Viola Davis became the first African-American to win a drama lead actress Emmy for her role as a tough criminal defense lawyer in ABC's ""How to Get Away With Murder.""""The only thing that separates women of color from anyone else is opportunity,"" Davis said in an emotional acceptance speech. ""You cannot win an Emmy for roles that are simply not there.""Davis thanked all the writers and producers ""who have redefined what it means to be beautiful, to be sexy, to be a leading woman, to be black."" Two other black actresses, Uzo Aduba (""Orange is the New Black"") and Regina King (""American Crime""), were also among Sunday's winners, while Jill Soloway joined the small club of women to win a directing Emmy, for the transgender comedy ""Transparent.""In the first Emmys for Amazon.com's foray into original content, ""Transparent"" also won four other Emmys, including lead actor for Jeffrey Tambor.Tambor, 71, won for his role as a father who transitions to a woman, and he dedicated the award - his first Emmy - to the transgender community.""Thank you for your patience, thank you for your courage, thank you for your stories, thank you for your inspiration, thank you for letting us be part of the change,"" he said.""Inside Amy Schumer,"" the no-holds-barred female comedy which is written and directed by Schumer, proved a popular first-time winner in the variety sketch series category.But Schumer, the hottest new talent in comedy, could not dislodge perennial Emmy favorite ""The Daily Show with Jon Stewart,"" which won three Emmys for best variety series, writing and directing.

891,"  BERLIN, Sept 21 The association of German book sellers accused Amazon and its subsidiary Audible on Monday of building a monopoly in the audio book business as it lodged complaints with the German competition authority and the European Commission.The association said in a statement that Amazon and Audible were abusing their dominant market position to force publishers to accept ""unreasonable conditions"" for the marketing of audio books.It said more than 90 percent of all downloads of audio books in Germany were made via the Audible or Amazon sites, or via the iTunes store, which is exclusively supplied by Audible.""The business model of Amazon and Audible is aimed at destroying the excellent book trade structure in Germany. These companies are avowedly on the way to establish a monopoly,"" said association head Alexander Skipis. Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The European Commission said it would assess the complaint, noting it worked closely with national competition authorities like the one in Germany on antitrust matters.The German association said its complaint meant it was now formally a party to ongoing European antitrust proceedings against Amazon. In June, the European Commission opened an investigation into Amazon's e-book business, examining whether clauses in its contracts prevent publishers from offering more favourable deals to competitors. Ebooks are a fast-growing industry and Amazon, which popularised the product, is Europe's biggest player.The company could be fined up to 10 percent of its global turnover if found guilty of breaching EU rules.The investigation is one of two against Amazon. It is also in the European Commission's crosshairs for deals with Luxembourg which allow it to pay extremely low taxes.

901,"  Wal-Mart Stores Inc is expanding free grocery pickup service to several markets in the U.S. as it seeks to capitalize on its network of physical stores amid growing competition with Amazon.com and others investing in home delivery.The world's largest retailer said on Tuesday that it would start offering curbside pickup for groceries ordered online in eight new markets this month - including Atlanta and Salt Lake City - with more to be added in the coming weeks.Wal-Mart has been testing online grocery delivery services in two markets and pickup in the five markets of Denver, Phoenix, San Jose, California, Bentonville, Arkansas, and Huntsville, Alabama. Tuesday's announcement solidifies a strategy of playing to its bricks-and-mortar footprint, with an estimated 70 percent of the U.S. population living within five miles of one of its 4,600 stores. ""We are not walking away from delivery,"" said Michael Bender, Chief Operating Officer of global e-commerce at Wal-Mart. ""But right now the focus for us is pickup, driven largely by what our customers are telling us."" The move comes as rivals attempt to find the right business model for tapping demand for pickup and delivery services.Target Corp this month partnered with Instacart Inc to deliver groceries for $3.99 per order in a pilot offering in Minneapolis. Amazon.com Inc is testing delivery in Seattle, New York, Philadelphia and California, for a $299 annual fee.Bender said Wal-Mart is targeting pickup in part because it allows customers to pinpoint a pickup time, rather than having to be at home at a set delivery time of fresh items. He cited a busy mother with children as an example of the type of customer that would benefit from the service. Shoppers can choose from about 30,000 items, roughly the same assortment as in stores. After ordering and paying online, customers drive to the outlet at a designated time and workers load items into their cars. Fayetteville and Charlotte, North Carolina; Ogden, Utah; Nashville, Tennessee; Tucson, Arizona; and Colorado Springs, Colorado are the other new markets for the service. Wal-Mart will add a new role of ""personal shopper"" to retrieve and store the items. In some cases, that will entail promoting workers within a store, but overall it expected to add some headcount related to the service, Bender said. Neil Stern, senior partner at retail consultancy McMillan-Doolittle, said investing in pick-up makes sense from a cost perspective.""The economics of pick-up are much better for a retailer. Delivering to the home remains costly, even as services like Instacart and Shipt attempt to reinvent the model,"" Stern said.

904,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Oct 2 Orbital ATK Inc beat out Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings Inc to become the future sole supplier of solid rocket boosters for United Launch Alliance by offering better long-term pricing agreements, substantial cost reductions and more investment, ULA said Friday.Tory Bruno, chief executive officer of the 50-50 venture owned by Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing Co, said the deal with Orbital, announced last week, was one of many strategic agreements the company was forging with big suppliers to drive down costs and prepare for more competition.He told a teleconference that ULA would release more details soon and observers would be ""amazed"" to see the savings it was able to generate through agreements with ""the most expensive parts of our supply chain."" ULA announced on Sept. 22 that Orbital would provide all solid rocket motors for its Atlas 5 and Vulcan launch vehicles from 2019, dealing a serious blow to Aerojet, which currently builds those motors for the Atlas rocket.Bruno said ULA's decision to choose Orbital did not change the fundamental nature of its relationship with Aerojet, which still provides other components to ULA, including RL-10 motors that power the upper stages of the Atlas 5 and Delta 4 rockets. He said Orbital simply offered ULA a better deal in this case, including its willingness to invest in non-recurring items to help drive down its costs.Bruno categorically declined to discuss Aerojet's $2 billion cash offer for the company, which was rejected by ULA's owners earlier this month, or reports that Aerojet and ULA remain in discussions about a number of business arrangements. He said ULA saw continued progress on the BE-4 engine being developed by Blue Origin, owned by Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos, and the engine should enter full-scale testing next year. He said Aerojet was also making ""very good progress"" on its rival AR-1 engine, but it lagged the BE-4 program by 16 months.""They're a great company. They have awesome people. We continue to need them to build the rockets,"" Bruno said.Bruno also rejected concerns raised by some analysts that ULA was taking on too much risk by switching to Orbital as its solid rocket booster supplier, noting that the company already made large boosters for NASA, and accounted for 95 percent of the overall U.S. production of solid rocket boosters.

905,"   By Mari Saito | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Etsy Inc, the online store that made its name selling handmade crafts, is trying to stop merchants from defecting as giant rival Amazon.com Inc prepares to attack it on its own ground with a new site for artisanal items called Handmade.But Etsy's policy of allowing sellers to use outside manufacturers continues to anger some of the smaller vendors of handmade items who helped make it successful. Even changes to that policy have done little to address the criticism or hold off defections, analysts and sellers say.""Until now, Etsy sellers had nowhere else to go,"" said Gil Luria, an analyst at Wedbush Securities based in Los Angeles. ""But what Handmade at Amazon represents is a trip back in time to Etsy's original vision.""Etsy disputes that sellers had no other outlets, saying it knows that while about half of its sellers sell only on its site, the other half also use other venues - from craft fairs to their own websites. But on average, even those who sell in many venues make the majority of their income on Etsy, the company said.Etsy, launched 10 years ago, became popular as an alternative to Amazon and eBay Inc, tapping into shoppers' appetite for handmade items.  But since its April initial public offering, which valued the company at $4 billion, Etsy's shares have fallen by more than 50 percent. And the company's losses doubled in the most recent quarter due in part to rising expenses and the stronger dollar, which dampened demand for U.S. products.CEO Chad Dickerson rejected the notion that Amazon's new product posed a threat, telling Reuters that Etsy's sellers want to be in an environment where their creativity is respected. He added, ""the most important thing about Etsy is not about having the lowest price or the fastest shipping.""In 2013, Etsy let sellers use outside manufacturers. That decision backfired, according to some critics of the company. Many sellers felt the decision was a betrayal of the site's roots. Sellers shut down their stores on the site in protest. In September Etsy announced Etsy Manufacturing, which will connect merchants with pre-approved manufacturers in the U.S. and Canada, emphasizing smaller companies that treat workers fairly.Some sellers say the policy does not address their primary concern, which is that they have to compete against larger vendors on price rather than the quality and distinctiveness of their products. ""I went from being a big fish in a handmade ecosystem to being a little fish in a saturated market,"" said Stacy Mecklenburg, a vendor of handmade swimsuits whose sales plateaued, she said, when she had to compete with cheaper manufactured goods.Amazon has been courting Etsy sellers since May, when it invited artists to apply to join Handmade. The retailer said recently it was putting the ""final touches"" on the site before it launches.

906,"  (Adds more details on Etsy in paragraphs 4, 7, 8 and 13)By Mari SaitoSAN FRANCISCO Oct 6 Etsy Inc, the online store that made its name selling handmade crafts, is trying to stop merchants from defecting as giant rival Amazon.com Inc prepares to attack it on its own ground with a new site for artisanal items called Handmade.But Etsy's policy of allowing sellers to use outside manufacturers continues to anger some of the smaller vendors of handmade items who helped make it successful. Even changes to that policy have done little to address the criticism or hold off defections, analysts and sellers say.""Until now, Etsy sellers had nowhere else to go,"" said Gil Luria, an analyst at Wedbush Securities based in Los Angeles. ""But what Handmade at Amazon represents is a trip back in time to Etsy's original vision.""Etsy disputes that sellers had no other outlets, saying it knows that while about half of its sellers sell only on its site, the other half also use other venues - from craft fairs to their own websites. But on average, even those who sell in many venues make the majority of their income on Etsy, the company said. Etsy, launched 10 years ago, became popular as an alternative to Amazon and eBay Inc, tapping into shoppers' appetite for handmade items.But since its April initial public offering, which valued the company at $4 billion, Etsy's shares have fallen by more than 50 percent. And the company's losses doubled in the most recent quarter due in part to rising expenses and the stronger dollar, which dampened demand for U.S. products. CEO Chad Dickerson rejected the notion that Amazon's new product posed a threat, telling Reuters that Etsy's sellers want to be in an environment where their creativity is respected. He added, ""the most important thing about Etsy is not about having the lowest price or the fastest shipping.""In 2013, Etsy let sellers use outside manufacturers. That decision backfired, according to some critics of the company. Many sellers felt the decision was a betrayal of the site's roots. Sellers shut down their stores on the site in protest.In September Etsy announced Etsy Manufacturing, which will connect merchants with pre-approved manufacturers in the U.S. and Canada, emphasizing smaller companies that treat workers fairly. Some sellers say the policy does not address their primary concern, which is that they have to compete against larger vendors on price rather than the quality and distinctiveness of their products.""I went from being a big fish in a handmade ecosystem to being a little fish in a saturated market,"" said Stacy Mecklenburg, a vendor of handmade swimsuits whose sales plateaued, she said, when she had to compete with cheaper manufactured goods.Amazon has been courting Etsy sellers since May, when it invited artists to apply to join Handmade. The retailer said recently it was putting the ""final touches"" on the site before it launches. It has not given a date for the launch.Recent Etsy chat forums show some sellers on the site saying they were sticking with Etsy - citing reasons varying from the extra work involved in managing another store presence, to Amazon's fees.

912,"  (New throughout, adds technology announcement, further comments, details and background)By David MorganWASHINGTON Oct 7 The Federal Aviation Administration will test new technology to detect and track rogue drone flights around U.S. airports through a partnership with Arlington, Virginia-based CACI International Inc, the agency said on Wednesday.The FAA is also testing other safety- and security-related technologies including geo-fencing software in response to a recent surge in unauthorized drone flights near airports and crowded public venues, Deputy Administrator Michael Whitaker said testified before a House aviation subcommittee.""We will assess the results of that technology as well as geo-fencing as well as other technologies to try to develop an approach in conjunction with other agencies that have a security issue involved here,"" Whitaker told lawmakers. He said FAA is also considering setting up a registry with manufacturers to keep track of drone owners, whether commercial or recreational. Congress in 2012 prevented FAA from regulating recreational drones, which are believed to be involved in many rogue flights.Officials say the growing number of unauthorized drone flights pose a safety and security risk to the public. But authorities have been able to track down the operators of the unmanned aerial systems in only a tiny fraction of cases. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the Pentagon have been involved in developing jamming technologies that could be deployed by federal authorities and local police.CACI International is a multinational professional services and information technology company that has contracted with federal agencies in the defense, intelligence and homeland security areas. Whitaker also told the House panel that FAA and private sector partners have demonstrated technology that would enable commercial drones to detect and avoid aircraft and other objects automatically as well as radio controls.Experts say detect-and-avoid and radio command-and-control technologies would be necessary for drones to fly autonomously over longer distances in package delivery systems envisioned by companies such as Amazon.com and GoogleThe FAA has proposed new regulations for commercial drone use. But the rules include restrictions that could limit commercial applications including provisions requiring unmanned aerial systems (UAS) to fly within an operator's line of sight and during daylight hours only. A final version of the regulations is expected early next year.""We are already looking beyond the small UAS rulemaking at what comes next in terms of the types of operations expected and what technologies we may need to certify to ensure safety,"" Whitaker in written testimony.

928,"   By Rodrigo Campos | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Oct 23 The Nasdaq 100 index, dominated by U.S. technology stocks, may set a record high next week, helped by good earnings from Apple Inc expected on Tuesday.Technology shares led the U.S. stock market's recovery this  week from its worst correction in four years in August, thanks to gains in Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft , after the three companies reported better-than-expected earnings results.The Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.9 percent to 17,646.70, the S&P 500 index recovered another 1.1 percent to 2,075.15, and the Nasdaq Composite closed the week up 2.27 percent at 5,031.86.Shares across Asia, Europe and the Americas all climbed, boosted by Thursday's message from European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi that he was ready to increase the ECB's bond buying program, and by an interest rate cut by China's central bank.Factors this coming week that may provide further support for U.S. stocks include a Federal Reserve policy meeting, which is not expected to raise interest rates yet, a report on U.S. third-quarter economic growth, and earnings from Apple.The Nasdaq 100 index, including Apple, is just 1.5 percent below its year high and 4.0 percent from its record high back in March 2000.Intel and Microsoft have seen their stocks recover more than 30 percent each since Aug. 25, while Amazon  and Facebook rose 28 percent and 23 percent,  respectively.But the 'underperformer' among these companies has been Apple, up only 14.8 percent from its Aug. 25 close, less than the Nasdaq 100's 15.1 percent gain in that time.In contrast to Microsoft, Facebook, Alphabet and Amazon, Apple shares did not post record or multi-year highs this week, even though it rose 7.2 percent, the largest weekly gain in a year. On Tuesday, though, Apple is expected to report $51.1 billion in revenue, a 21.3 percent increase compared to the same quarter of last year. Earnings are seen at $1.879 per share.""The bar has been raised a bit on its earnings report from where it was a week ago. The price action is telling you there's more optimism built into it,"" said Michael James, managing director of equities trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles.Options market action shows traders expect Apple shares to move roughly 5.0 percent by the end of next week. The average move for the stock the day after its report in the last eight quarters was 4.4 percent, up or down.""Will an above-estimates from Apple and raised guidance help? Sure it will. But we could still get there without that happening,"" said James of the possibility of the Nasdaq 100 hitting a record. ""The power of the moves in some of these large cap tech stocks has been breathtaking,"" he said.Chip makers were also among the top five percentage gainers in the Nasdaq 100 since the index closed at its 2015 low on Aug. 25, with SanDisk topping the list with a 70 percent jump on the back of a takeover bid from Western Digital.The overwhelming leadership from established technology companies is a positive for this market move higher, according to Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh.""The last time the Nasdaq 100 was the market leader a lot of it was speculative investments, but these (tech) companies actually return money to shareholders,"" she said.""Tech deserves the leadership; the stock market is rewarding growth."" BIOTECH THE FLIP SIDE TO TECH STOCK LEADERSHIP While technology stocks have led the market recovery, biotech stocks have been a drag on performance.The Nasdaq Biotech Index is down 3.5 percent from its Aug. 25 close, and more than 20 percent below its year high. The three index components with the largest declines in market capitalization in the last eight weeks are Mylan, Illumina and Biogen.""There has been a major rotation out of healthcare and into tech and it has continued after the recent earnings reports,"" said Wedbush's James, referring to strong results from Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet.Biotech stocks were shaken in September when U.S. presidential candidate Hillary Clinton first tweeted concerns about drug prices and the selling spread to other areas of the healthcare sector. Investors have been dumping shares of everything from hospitals to traditional pharmaceutical companies and insurers in recent weeks.Since peaking in July, the Nasdaq Biotech Index has fallen 23 percent, the broad S&P Health Care Index has lost 12 percent and the S&P 500 Health Care Facilities index  is down 31 percent.Fund managers now say they expect regulatory threats on drug prices, disappointing earnings, higher interest rates that could hurt heavily indebted hospitals, and the loss of the initial Obamacare boost to business to all weigh on health sector stocks this year.

933,"   By Anya George Tharakan and Alexandria Sage  E-commerce company Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) on Thursday recorded a surprise profit for the second quarter in a row, propelled by higher sales in North America and its cloud computing business, and its shares rose 11 percent. Amazon, which has historically struggled with profitability while spending to expand beyond its core online marketplace offerings, reined in costs and was helped to profitability by growth at its Amazon Web Services (AWS) segment.   Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky told reporters on a conference call that the balance between investing and cost controls ""will be lumpy over time."" Olsavsky said the company would continue to invest in areas  that work with customers, adding that even though investments would ""remain very high"" Amazon would be looking for ways to cut costs. Net sales from Amazon Web Services, which has more than 1 million active customers in 190 countries, rose more than 78 percent in the quarter to $2.09 billion.    ""There are questions about what's the sustainable margin for this? Are we seeing just a hyper growth phase now? But for right now, AWS is driving the train, and it's going to for the near future,"" said BGC Partners analyst Colin Gillis. Analysts on a separate conference call asked Amazon about its forecast for long-term margins on AWS, but the company provided no figures.Cloud computing is the fastest growing business for Amazon, and the new services in which it is investing, such as Internet of Things, will help the company capitalize on rising demand to store and manage large amounts of information.Sales in North America, the largest market for the world's biggest retailer, rose 28.3 percent to $15.01 billion in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, on robust Prime Day sales and demand for electronics and general merchandise. In July, Amazon said customers had ordered 34.4 million items worldwide during the one-day sale for members of its $99 per year Prime subscription service.The company forecast net sales growth of 14 percent to 25 percent, to a range of $33.50 billion and $36.75 billion, for the holiday shopping quarter.Analysts, on average, had been expecting revenue of $35.16 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. For the latest quarter, Amazon reported a profit of $79 million, or 17 cents per share, compared with a loss of $437 million, or 95 cents per share, a year ago.Total net sales rose 23.2 percent to $25.36 billion.  Analysts, on average, had expected a loss of 13 cents per share on revenue of $24.91 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Amazon's shares rose to $625 in late trade after closing at $563.91 on Thursday.

934,"   By Rodrigo Campos | NEW YORK  NEW YORK The Nasdaq 100 index, dominated by U.S. technology stocks, may set a record high next week, helped by good earnings from Apple Inc expected on Tuesday. Technology shares led the U.S. stock market's recovery this  week from its worst correction in four years in August, thanks to gains in Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft, after the three companies reported better-than-expected earnings results. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.9 percent to 17,646.70, the S&P 500 index recovered another 1.1 percent to 2,075.15, and the Nasdaq Composite closed the week up 2.27 percent at 5,031.86.Shares across Asia, Europe and the Americas all climbed, boosted by Thursday's message from European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi that he was ready to increase the ECB's bond buying program, and by an interest rate cut by China's central bank. Factors this coming week that may provide further support for U.S. stocks include a Federal Reserve policy meeting, which is not expected to raise interest rates yet, a report on U.S. third-quarter economic growth, and earnings from Apple.The Nasdaq 100 index, including Apple, is just 1.5 percent below its year high and 4.0 percent from its record high back in March 2000.Intel and Microsoft have seen their stocks recover more than 30 percent each since Aug. 25, while Amazon and Facebook rose 28 percent and 23 percent,  respectively. But the 'underperformer' among these companies has been Apple, up only 14.8 percent from its Aug. 25 close, less than the Nasdaq 100's 15.1 percent gain in that time.In contrast to Microsoft, Facebook, Alphabet and Amazon, Apple shares did not post record or multi-year highs this week, even though it rose 7.2 percent, the largest weekly gain in a year. On Tuesday, though, Apple is expected to report $51.1 billion in revenue, a 21.3 percent increase compared to the same quarter of last year. Earnings are seen at $1.879 per share.""The bar has been raised a bit on its earnings report from where it was a week ago. The price action is telling you there's more optimism built into it,"" said Michael James, managing director of equities trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles.Options market action shows traders expect Apple shares to move roughly 5.0 percent by the end of next week. The average move for the stock the day after its report in the last eight quarters was 4.4 percent, up or down.""Will an above-estimates from Apple and raised guidance help? Sure it will. But we could still get there without that happening,"" said James of the possibility of the Nasdaq 100 hitting a record.""The power of the moves in some of these large cap tech stocks has been breathtaking,"" he said. Chip makers were also among the top five percentage gainers in the Nasdaq 100 since the index closed at its 2015 low on Aug. 25, with SanDisk topping the list with a 70 percent jump on the back of a takeover bid from Western Digital.The overwhelming leadership from established technology companies is a positive for this market move higher, according to Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh.""The last time the Nasdaq 100 was the market leader a lot of it was speculative investments, but these (tech) companies actually return money to shareholders,"" she said.""Tech deserves the leadership; the stock market is rewarding growth."" BIOTECH THE FLIP SIDE TO TECH STOCK LEADERSHIP While technology stocks have led the market recovery, biotech stocks have been a drag on performance. The Nasdaq Biotech Index is down 3.5 percent from its Aug. 25 close, and more than 20 percent below its year high. The three index components with the largest declines in market capitalization in the last eight weeks are Mylan, Illumina and Biogen.""There has been a major rotation out of healthcare and into tech and it has continued after the recent earnings reports,"" said Wedbush's James, referring to strong results from Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet.Biotech stocks were shaken in September when U.S. presidential candidate Hillary Clinton first tweeted concerns about drug prices and the selling spread to other areas of the healthcare sector. Investors have been dumping shares of everything from hospitals to traditional pharmaceutical companies and insurers in recent weeks.Since peaking in July, the Nasdaq Biotech Index has fallen 23 percent, the broad S&P Health Care Index has lost 12 percent and the S&P 500 Health Care Facilities index is down 31 percent. Fund managers now say they expect regulatory threats on drug prices, disappointing earnings, higher interest rates that could hurt heavily indebted hospitals, and the loss of the initial Obamacare boost to business to all weigh on health sector stocks this year.

935,"  (Updates estimates in paragraph 13 and adds day of Apple earnings announcement)By David RandallNEW YORK Oct 26 U.S. companies are far from optimistic that next year will see them get a break from the tough economic and market conditions they have faced in 2015. And that may well hurt capital investment and jobs growth.In the first three weeks of October, 165 American companies have cited the slowing global economy in their outlooks for earnings and revenue. That is up from 108 in the same period last year, and 97 in the year-earlier quarter, according to an analysis of earnings reports by Thomson Reuters.Among the phrases that have appeared in many of those statements are ""challenging macroeconomic environment,"" or ""global headwinds.""Earnings and revenue have been depressed this year largely because of the strong dollar, economic weakness in China and Brazil, and tumbling oil and commodities prices.The rise in the value of the American currency means that profits earned in foreign currencies are worth less when translated into dollars, possibly making American exports less competitive.The weakness in major emerging markets has hit sales by U.S. multinationals and the plunge in the prices of energy, metals and minerals have not only hit oil producers and miners but the manufacturing and service companies who sell to them.The problems are clearly not across the board, as shown by better-than-expected results reported last Thursday by technology heavyweights Amazon.com Inc, Google-owner Alphabet Inc, and Microsoft Corp. They are all benefiting from the expansion of cloud-based computing.But among the major companies to announce job cuts in recent weeks are industrial conglomerates United Technologies Corp  and General Electric Co, technology giant Hewlett-Packard Co., and the world's largest oilfield services provider Schlumberger.Even social media company Twitter Inc, and biotechnology group Biogen Inc have said they are cutting jobs. Large employers announced 205,759 U.S. job cuts in the third quarter, the largest amount since the third quarter of 2009, according to a report from outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas.Caterpillar Inc, meanwhile, told analysts that it expects its capital spending to be ""less than half of what it was in 2012,"" while appliance maker Whirlpool Corp  lowered its capital spending for 2015 to between $700 million and $750 million, down from a previous forecast of $750 million to $800 million.Those moves are coming at a time when overall corporate earnings in the third quarter are on pace to fall by 2.8 percent from this time last year. So far 59 percent of companies have reported revenues that have fallen below analyst estimates, according to Thomson Reuters data.And expectations for 2016 are falling as well - in July analysts were predicting that corporate earnings per share in the first two quarters would grow 9.2 percent and 13.7 percent, respectively; those figures now are down to 4.7 percent for the first quarter and 6.2 percent for the second.The companies own forecasts, meanwhile, are falling short of expectations at the greatest pace since June 2014, according to a BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research report. Companies ""have a reason to be worried. This isn't a major economic slowdown, but a meaningful one, and once you see a reduction in risk taking you will see a reduction in growth,"" said Paul Hoffmeister, a portfolio manager with the Quaker Funds.REBOUND POSSIBLE Few expect the economy to go into a free-fall, of course. Should the dollar and oil prices stabilize, the prospects for many companies could improve quickly and their earnings and revenue could beat expectations, setting the stage for a stock rally.Some consumer-driven companies also continue to do well, both in the U.S. and even in China, where both Nike Inc  and toy-maker Mattel have said they still see high rates of growth. Apple Inc, which reports its quarterly results Tuesday, has said that China remains a big part of its growth plans. And some multinationals who have taken a pounding, such as household products giant Procter & Gamble Co, have signaled they may be turning a corner. P&G said it sees sales growth strengthening in the second half of the year, as it focuses on more profitable lines such as Pampers diapers and Tide detergent.Many of those feeling the pinch from slowing growth overseas are the same companies that just a few years ago were counting on China and other emerging economies to bolster their bottom lines.For example, International Business Machines Corp, which cut its full-year profit forecast, said fewer big deals in China caused revenue from that country to fall 17 percent in the third quarter.Alan Gayle, a portfolio manager at RidgeWorth Investments, said that he has been increasingly moving more of his equity portfolio into U.S.-based companies that have limited exposure to China and other emerging markets.""I've pulled back from my China and emerging market exposure until there are clearer signs that the economy has stopped slowing,"" he said, adding that he expects that top-line revenue growth will continue to be a challenge for U.S. companies there.Yet he remains guardedly optimistic that oil and other commodity prices are nearing a bottom, and that consumer spending in the U.S. and Europe should remain steady.""We think the chances of a global recession remain quite low,""  he said.(Additional reporting by Lewis Krauskopf, Robin Paxton and Bill Berkrot; Editing by Linda Stern, Martin Howell and Bernadette Baum)",2015-10-26,AMZN,"Mon Oct 26, 2015 | 1:47pm EDT","UPDATE 1-With global outlook weak, many U.S. companies tighten belts",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-companies-outlook-idUSL1N12Q1IO20151026?type=companyNews

943,"  LONDON Nov 10 Supermarket Asda, the British arm of Wal-Mart, said it will not participate in this year's Black Friday shopping frenzy, a year after brawls at one of its stores characterised the arrival of the U.S. import to Britain.For the first time last year, most British retailers fully embraced ""Black Friday"" promotions, but many underestimated the demand and police were called to control crowds outside some shops, including Asda.British retailers had hoped the shopping day, named after the day of the year when U.S. retailers traditionally become profitable, would also kick start the Christmas shopping period, however many found it in fact disrupted their cycle.As a result many store groups found themselves selling stock at a discount after finding there was less demand for full-price goods in the following weeks, hitting their profit margins. Asda said it had taken its decision after listening to customers. Instead of investing in a one-off day of sales, it will invest over 26 million pounds ($39 million)in sustained discounts spread across the traditional seasonal shop.

944,"   By Aditi Shah | BENGALURU, India  BENGALURU, India E-commerce giant Amazon.com (AMZN.O) is taking lessons learnt from its daily battles with India's choked roads and cramped cities to some of its largest developed markets, exporting a model of cheaper deliveries and reduced warehousing costs.Online shopping is booming in India, where millions of consumers are newly able to access the Internet thanks to cheap smartphones. For Amazon, it is already the largest contributor of new customers outside the United States.But, like local rivals Flipkart and Snapdeal, Amazon has struggled with deliveries in cities where snarl-ups are frequent and road signs unreliable. In response, firms have set up logistics networks and use motorbikes instead of trucks.Flipkart, for one, has tapped Mumbai's dabbawalas, a more than a century-old lunch box distribution service. More than two years on from its arrival in India, Amazon says it is now ready to apply some of the innovations applied here to markets including the United States, Mexico and Brazil.Britain, for example, could get a delivery service called Easy Ship, where orders are picked up by Amazon's crew directly from sellers, cutting out the time and cost of sending goods to a warehouse and the need for more space.""It's not just that we learn from the big brothers like North America,"" Akhil Saxena, director of operations at Amazon India said in a recent interview at the company's local headquarters in the southern city of Bengaluru. ""There is so much focus on India and the kind of growth that is happening here... People say, if it works for them, let's see what we can pick and learn,"" said Saxena. E-commerce in India could grow to $137 billion by 2020 from $11 billion in 2013, says Morgan Stanley, and firms like Amazon, local market leader Flipkart and rival Snapdeal, backed by Japan's SoftBank (9984.T), are fighting for a bigger share. Speedy and cheap delivery is critical to winning over customers in a cut-throat industry, where heavy discounts mean firms are already burning through substantial cash to grow.Harish Bijoor, an independent brand expert and business analyst, said the innovative delivery services were helping Amazon extend its reach in India, even at the cost of giving up some control over logistics - a lesson it could export.""E-commerce is a trust business today and without that you cannot achieve scale,"" Bijoor said. MADE IN INDIA Unlike in its other markets, government restrictions on foreign investment mean Amazon operates in India purely as a marketplace, rather than hawking its own goods. That tightens its relations with a multitude of sellers, and underlines the need to keep those connections simple.Launched in India in 2014, Easy Ship, for example, cuts out costs of storing, packing and separately shipping goods. ""This probably cuts your overall transportation cost at least by half,"" said Samuel Thomas, Amazon India's director of transportation, adding that it trains sellers to provide the service, now used by 30,000, or more than 75 percent of them.Another service introduced in India in May and considered for export to other markets, Seller Flex, allows sellers to have the flexibility to store goods and ship them to customers on their own, instead of routing them through Amazon.Amazon provides technology and training to ensure goods are packed, labeled and delivered as the company would.While Amazon in developed markets may not want to tweak its model for best selling goods, analysts said, it could consider the made-in-India seller solution to cut down on warehousing and delivery costs for thousands of ""non core"" products which are offered, but infrequently bought. ""Amazon is becoming a lot more flexible about how it services its customers,"" said Neil Saunders, at UK-based retail research firm Conlumino.""If you go back about five years ... it was fairly one-dimensional. Now you have Amazon Prime, in some cities you have same day deliveries, a couple of hour deliveries ... And this is part of that.""

953,"   By Aditi Shah | BENGALURU India  BENGALURU India E-commerce giant Amazon.com is taking lessons learnt from its daily battles with India's choked roads and cramped cities to some of its largest developed markets, exporting a model of cheaper deliveries and reduced warehousing costs.Online shopping is booming in India, where millions of consumers are newly able to access the Internet thanks to cheap smartphones. For Amazon, it is already the largest contributor of new customers outside the United States.But, like local rivals Flipkart and Snapdeal, Amazon has struggled with deliveries in cities where snarl-ups are frequent and road signs unreliable. In response, firms have set up logistics networks and use motorbikes instead of trucks.Flipkart, for one, has tapped Mumbai's dabbawalas, a more than a century-old lunch box distribution service. More than two years on from its arrival in India, Amazon says it is now ready to apply some of the innovations applied here to markets including the United States, Mexico and Brazil.Britain, for example, could get a delivery service called Easy Ship, where orders are picked up by Amazon's crew directly from sellers, cutting out the time and cost of sending goods to a warehouse and the need for more space.""It's not just that we learn from the big brothers like North America,"" Akhil Saxena, director of operations at Amazon India said in a recent interview at the company's local headquarters in the southtern city of Bengaluru.

954,"  (Adds Amazon no comment, background)FRANKFURT Nov 16 Germany's Federal Cartel Office has begun an investigation into Apple Inc's  arrangement with Amazon for purchasing audiobooks, the competition watchdog said in a statement on Monday.It said both companies had a long-term agreement for the purchase of audio books by Apple from Amazon's Audible business for distribution via Apple's iTunes store.""The two companies have a strong position in the digital offering of audiobooks in Germany. Therefore, we feel compelled to examine the agreement between these two competitors in the audiobooks in more detail,"" cartel office chief Andreas Mundt said in the statement. Apple and Amazon-unit Audible declined to comment. In September ,the association of German book sellers lodged complaints with the watchdog that Amazon and Audible were building a monopoly in the audio book business.The association said that Amazon and Audible were abusing their dominant market position to force publishers to accept ""unreasonable conditions"" for the marketing of audio books. It said more than 90 percent of all downloads of audio books in Germany were made via the Audible or Amazon sites, or via the iTunes store, which is exclusively supplied by Audible.In June, the European Commission opened an investigation into Amazon's e-book business, examining whether clauses in its contracts prevented publishers from offering more favourable deals to competitors.

In a twist from the last few years, there is little fear of the Federal Reserve tightening policy, and in fact, a number of investors said they are looking forward to higher rates, if only because a rate hike would return the market to a more normal footing.Activist investor Carl Icahn told Reuters that rates ""need"" to go higher, while Wells Capital Management senior portfolio manager Margaret Patel said a rate increase would boost lending to small businesses and prompt investors to expand holdings away from mega-cap companies like Amazon.com Inc and Google parent Alphabet Inc that have accounted for nearly all of this year's positive gains in the benchmark S&P 500 index.However, fund managers say there's no doubt that the Federal Reserve's expected interest rate increase in December, which would be the first hike in almost a decade, will further strengthen the dollar, eating into revenue and earnings growth at a time when the European Central Bank and Japanese Central Bank continue to weaken their own currencies.""Central banks, led by the Fed, are going on divergent monetary policies and saying we're no longer all on the same side,"" said Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz SE.A strong dollar both crimps exports by U.S.-based companies and lowers the value of international sales when they are translated back into dollars. Barclays estimates that the dollar will rise by 7 percent against a basket of major currencies in 2016, and coming on the heels of the dollar's 15 percent increase so far in 2015 Barclays estimates that will cut potential revenue growth in the S&P 500 by half.POCKETS OF OPTIMISM Fund managers uniformly predicted the U.S. equity market will at most post gains in the low single digits, suggesting that the long bull market that has returned more than 200 percent since it began in March 2009 is petering out. ""I am not very bullish in equities in general because I don't think growth will be as robust"" in the new year, said Maria Vassalou, partner at Perella Weinberg Partners.Icahn said he is short the market overall, meaning he is betting stock prices will fall.The benchmark S&P 500 once again turned positive for the year on Wednesday after minutes from the Federal Reserve's October meeting showed several officials rallied behind a possible December rate hike. Barring a late rally, 2015 will be the first year since 2011 that the S&P 500 does not post double-digit gains. Consumer, technology and small-cap stocks were among the few bright spots mentioned by the majority of fund managers participating in the summit.""Jobs are rising, wages are rising, so the consumer outlook has got to be pretty positive,"" said Mario Gabelli, founder and chief executive of Gabelli Asset Management. Gabelli said his funds are looking to go ""wherever the consumer is,"" adding to a position in General Mills Inc in part because of its expanding line of organic and natural foods.Patel, of Wells Capital, expects the equity market to pick up in the second half of 2016. She is bullish on home improvement companies such as Home Depot Inc, and noted that medical device makers should prove immune to calls for lower prices that have upended the shares of biotech companies.For Steve Einhorn, vice chairman of hedge fund Omega Advisors, even amid the cautious outlook overall, there is little reason to fear a looming bear market,""Virtually nothing I look at today suggests that the U.S. is vulnerable to recession,"" he said.Follow Reuters Summits on Twitter @Reuters_Summits   (Reporting by David Randall; Editing by Leslie Adler)",2015-11-20,AMZN,"Fri Nov 20, 2015 | 7:00am EST","RPT-REUTERS SUMMIT-Investors see modest equities growth in 2016, ready for Fed rate hike",http://www.reuters.com//article/investing-summit-outlook-reuters-summit-idUSL1N13E33R20151120?type=companyNews

Barclays estimates that the dollar will rise by 7 percent against a basket of major currencies in 2016, and coming on the heels of the dollar's 15 percent increase so far in 2015 Barclays estimates that will cut potential revenue growth in the S&P 500 by half.POCKETS OF OPTIMISM Fund managers uniformly predicted the U.S. equity market will at most post gains in the low single digits, suggesting that the long bull market that has returned more than 200 percent since it began in March 2009 is petering out. ""I am not very bullish in equities in general because I don't think growth will be as robust"" in the new year, said Maria Vassalou, partner at Perella Weinberg Partners.Icahn said he is short the market overall, meaning he is betting stock prices will fall.The benchmark S&P 500 once again turned positive for the year on Wednesday after minutes from the Federal Reserve's October meeting showed several officials rallied behind a possible December rate hike. Barring a late rally, 2015 will be the first year since 2011 that the S&P 500 does not post double-digit gains. Consumer, technology and small-cap stocks were among the few bright spots mentioned by the majority of fund managers participating in the summit.""Jobs are rising, wages are rising, so the consumer outlook has got to be pretty positive,"" said Mario Gabelli, founder and chief executive of Gabelli Asset Management. Gabelli said his funds are looking to go ""wherever the consumer is,"" adding to a position in General Mills Inc in part because of its expanding line of organic and natural foods.Patel, of Wells Capital, expects the equity market to pick up in the second half of 2016. She is bullish on home improvement companies such as Home Depot Inc, and noted that medical device makers should prove immune to calls for lower prices that have upended the shares of biotech companies.For Steve Einhorn, vice chairman of hedge fund Omega Advisors, even amid the cautious outlook overall, there is little reason to fear a looming bear market,""Virtually nothing I look at today suggests that the U.S. is vulnerable to recession,"" he said.Follow Reuters Summits on Twitter @Reuters_Summits   (Reporting by David Randall; Editing by Leslie Adler)",2015-11-20,AMZN,"Fri Nov 20, 2015 | 1:00am EST","REUTERS SUMMIT-Investors see modest equities growth in 2016, ready for Fed rate hike",http://www.reuters.com//article/investing-summit-outlook-idUSL1N13E2I120151120?type=companyNews
957,"  (Adds detail on time, location, magnitude)LIMA Nov 24 Two major magnitude 7.6 earthquakes struck the Peruvian-Brazilian border in the Amazon basin within minutes of each other on Tuesday, the U.S. Geological Survey said, but there were no immediate reports of damage.Damage was likely limited as the epicenter was deep in the Amazonian jungle, around 184 miles (296 km) northwest of the Peruvian town of Puerto Maldonado, in a sparsely populated area. Both quakes were also very deep, at some 375 miles (602 km) below ground. The quakes, which struck at 5:45 p.m. (2245 GMT) and then five minutes later, were felt by residents in northern Chile, the Brazilian city of Brasileia, 154 miles (247 km) west, and Peru's capital, Lima, 423 miles (681 km) to the east. They were located inland and there was no risk of a Pacific tsunami, authorities said. ""At this point there is no reported damage,"" said the head of Peru's emergency services, Alfredo Murgueytio. The head of the fire department for the border state of Acre in Brazil, Coronel Carlos Gondim, also said there had been no reports of any damage or casualties.Mining as well as oil and gas companies in the area reported operations functioning normally. Peru, the world no.3 copper producer, is located on the Pacific 'Ring of Fire' and earthquakes are a fairly regular occurrence.

958,"  (Adds new comments, details on Walmart protest, comment from company official, online sales data, updates shares with closing prices)By Nandita Bose and Nathan LayneCHICAGO/PITTSBURGH Nov 27 America's annual Black Friday shopping extravaganza was short on fireworks this year as U.S. retailers' discounts on electronics, clothing and other holiday gifts failed to draw big crowds to stores and shopping malls.Major retail stocks including Best Buy and Wal-Mart closed lower while Target, picked out by one analyst for its promotion strategy, saw its shares tick up.Bargain hunters found relatively little competition compared with previous years. Some had already shopped Thursday evening, reflecting a new normal of U.S. holiday shopping, where stores open up with deals on Thanksgiving itself, rather than waiting until Black Friday.Retailers ""have taken the sense of urgency out for consumers by spreading their promotions throughout the year and what we are seeing is a result of that,"" said Jeff Simpson, director of the retail practice at Deloitte. Traffic in stores was light on Friday, while Thursday missed his expectations, he said.As much as 20 percent of holiday shopping is expected to be done over the Thanksgiving weekend this year, analysts said. But  the four days are not considered a strong indicator for the entire season. A slow start last year led to deeper promotions and a shopping rush in the final ten days of December.Steve Bratspies, chief merchandising officer, Wal-Mart Stores Inc, told Reuters he was not surprised that a store would see thinner crowds on Friday after it kicked off Black Friday deals on Thursday night.Suntrust Robinson Humphrey analysts were more blunt, calling Thursday a ""bust"". ""Members of our team who went to the malls first had no problem finding parking or navigating stores,"" he wrote in a note. The Macy's store at Water Tower Place mall on a rainy Chicago morning saw thin crowds in the early hours of Friday. Later in the morning, more than 1,000 protestors clogged Chicago's Magnificent Mile shopping corridor.Nia Darrell, a 23-year-old student, was shopping for coats and handbags at the store with two friends.""I shopped online yesterday and picked up most of what I wanted,"" she said."" I'm out because Black Friday is more like a tradition, but the discounts are similar even online this year.""While Black Friday may be losing some appeal in the United States, British shoppers have taken to the concept enthusiastically, with reports of large crowds at big stores and malls in the UK. Shares of Target Corp gained 0.4 percent, but J.C. Penney wad down 0.7 percent, and Macy's and Best Buy lost about 1 percent. Wal-Mart dipped 0.6 percent, while Amazon.com Inc was down 0.3 percent.A broad retail index was down 0.15 percent in abbreviated trading.Traffic was better at some retailers. Analysts at Cowen & Co said Target stood out with its ""innovative promotions,"" and teen retailer American Eagle Outfitters Inc saw more traffic due to store-wide discounts of 40 percent. ONLINE SALES RISE Shoppers in the United States spent $822 million online between midnight and 11 am ET, a 15-percent increase from 2014 but lower than the expected growth of 19 percent, according to the Adobe Digital Index, which tracked 180 million visits to over 4,500 U.S. retail sites. On Thanksgiving Day, online sales rose 22 percent from midnight to 5 pm ET.Many stores around the country were full on Thanksgiving evening. Media showed brawling shoppers at a packed Kentucky mall Thursday, forcing a police officer to break up the fight.Wal-Mart worker group 'Our Wal-Mart' said 1,400 workers planned to fast and protest around the country for better wages, but there was no indication that would hurt sales.Early Black Friday discounts included $700 off a 60-inch Samsung television at Best Buy for $799.99, 20 percent off a $75 purchase at Target, and a Kindle for $49.99 on Amazon.com.The National Retail Federation is expecting holiday sales to rise 3.7 percent, slower than last year's 4.1 percent growth rate, due to stagnant wages and sluggish job growth.Jorgette Clark, 27, said her budget would probably be lower this year because her husband works in the energy industry.""I feel like we scaled back this year. Our husbands work in the oil fields... It's probably a smaller Christmas this year.""

959,"   By James Davey | LONDON  LONDON Nov 27 Britain's shopping streets, out-of-town malls and websites will be awash with discounted goods on Friday as shoppers chase ""Black Friday"" deals in a spending frenzy expected to top last year's record level.Retailers will be hoping the one-off promotions will kick-start Christmas trading after a weak November when, according to an industry survey published on Tuesday, sales grew at the slowest rate in nine months.That will mean managing the event better than last year, when a surge in low-margin Black Friday sales was followed by weaker-than-expected demand, as shoppers held back in the hope of more discounts as well as traditional post-Christmas sales.In the United States, Black Friday, the day after the Thanksgiving holiday, was so named because spending would pick up and retailers would traditionally begin to turn a profit for the year - moving from the red into the black.Introduced into Britain in 2010 by U.S. online retailer Amazon, the day has developed into an important fixture of the UK shopping calendar as more and more chains join in. According to a survey by Barclays, some 77 percent of UK retailers are holding Black Friday promotions.""Black Friday has grown enormously over the last few years and we're now expecting it to be the largest sales event of the year,"" said Stuart Ramage, e-commerce director at Dixons Carphone, Britain's largest electricals retailer.Retail researcher Conlumino is forecasting the event will generate UK sales, both in stores and online, of 1.6 billion pounds ($2.4 billion), up 20 percent on 2014. However, after last year's event caused long queues and sparked brawls in stores as shoppers sought bargains, it may be more of an online event this year.Researcher FootFall reckons Black Friday in-store shopper numbers will be down by up to 4 percent year-on-year, also impacted by some retailers - including Amazon, Argos, Marks & Spencer and Dixons Carphone - elongating Black Friday activity beyond a single day of discounts. This year, Amazon is offering more than 7,000 deals over the course of a week, while Dixons Carphone is offering over 3,000 deals over 10 days.At Tesco, Britain's biggest retailer, Black Friday started on its website at midnight, while doors will open at 250 of its largest stores earlier than normal at 0500 GMT.The supermarket is offering over 200 electrical, entertainment and mobile products with discounts of up to 70 percent. Standout offers include a Digihome 49 inch large screen TV for 199 pounds, saving 150 pounds.Despite the publicity, some analysts are wary of the impact of the discounts on retailers' pricing power, pointing out that some of chains which shunned the event last year, such as clothing retailers Next and Jigsaw, were among the best Christmas performers.($1 = 0.6616 pounds)   (Editing by Mark Potter)",2015-11-27,AMZN,"Thu Nov 26, 2015 | 7:00pm EST",Britons chase Black Friday bargains,http://www.reuters.com//article/britain-blackfriday-idUSL8N13J4H220151127?type=companyNews

Slow service was also reported at payments processor PayPal Inc . The data underscores the ongoing shift in shopping online, which makes up for slowing spending in stores. But product shortages raise broader concerns about inventory planning by retailers during the most crucial time of the year.Adobe tracked 80 percent of all online transactions from the top 100 U.S. retailers and said sales are on track to meet its expectation of a record $3 billion by the end of Monday.Retail stocks including Amazon, Wal-Mart, Target and Macy's Inc fell between 1 and 3 percent on Monday. Data from RetailNext showed overall in-store sales for Thursday and Friday fell 1.5 percent, with roughly the same number of customers shopping but spending less.Data from ChannelAdvisor, a retail technology and services firm, showed marketplace sales at Amazon, which account for more than 40 percent of Amazon's total revenue, grew 22.4 percent, Google Inc's Google Shopping marketplace grew 14.34 percent while eBay Inc rose 1.9 percent from midnight to noon eastern on Monday.On Target's website, www.target.com, some shoppers looking for bargains were greeted with an error message: ""So sorry, but high traffic's causing delays.

A Target spokeswoman said that as the website witnesses spikes in traffic it places some guests in a queue, while millions of others shopped on the website. She said Target's volume was already twice as high as its busiest day ever.Most U.S. retailers like Wal-Mart, Target and Best Buy  began offering some of the season's best online deals, which traditionally had been reserved for Cyber Monday, several weeks in advance.Between Thanksgiving day and Sunday, $8.03 billion was spent online, a 17 percent increase from 2014, Adobe said. The average shopper spent $135.25, up 4 percent from a year ago. Mobile, which includes smartphones and tablets, drove 32 percent of online sales, Adobe said.Mastercard, which tracks spending in its card network as well as other forms of payments, said its data also showed a double-digit jump in e-commerce sales from Thanksgiving to Sunday, above its expectations for an 8 percent rise.Mastercard said spending overall was brisk. It said specialty apparel retailers saw sales pick-up during the four-day period as colder weather unleashed pent-up demand for winter clothing but that revenue for department store chains and electronics retailers remained subdued.IBM has predicted that Cyber Monday online sales would grow by more than 18 percent compared with 2014.

962,"  (Repeats to widen distribution, no changes to text)* Deforestation stabilising overall, but huge tracts cleared* Business value of forests estimated at $150 billion annually* Prince Charles urges more firms to commit to zero deforestationBy Barbara Lewis and Megan RowlingPARIS, Dec 1 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Business leaders, environment ministers and even royalty urged companies to eschew raw materials that destroy forests, at the U.N. climate summit in Paris on Tuesday.The CEO of Marks and Spencer, Britain's high-street retail giant, said $150 billion per year of value was at stake, in terms of the resources forests provide for business, including palm oil, soy and timber.Marc Bolland took to the podium on the sidelines of the climate summit, alongside representatives of indigenous Amazon dwellers and Peru's environment minister, while on a separate stage Britain's Prince Charles and Brazilian officials also called for the protection of forests. ""We will reward countries that tackle deforestation,"" Bolland pledged, saying firms should source their raw materials from sustainable nations.""Working alone is not enough. We need partnership. We need scale. It's about produce and protect,"" Bolland said.Marks and Spencer is a member of a Consumer Goods Forum that includes Unilever and Nestle, which is working for sustainable business practices to minimise waste of resources such as water and energy, as well as trees. Prince Charles singled out Unilever as a pioneer of sustainability, but said companies had to do more.""It remains the case that many of the world's largest companies and their financial backers pay scant, by which I really mean no, attention to the deforestation footprint of their supply chains,"" the prince told delegates.All commodities firms should commit to stopping deforestation, he added, so that not cutting down more trees than are replaced becomes ""the norm, rather than the exception"".Companies are increasingly aware of the benefits of sustainable practices for their brands as environment campaigners name and shame bad practice on social media, and pressure on resources, such as water, agricultural crops and trees, drives up costs. Representing the people of the Amazon, whose way of life depends on the forest, Brazil's Environment Minister Izabella Teixeira said laws and incentives must persuade local authorities and business to protect the rainforest.""We need to put together protection and production,"" she said.Data issued last week showed the destruction of Brazil's Amazon forest, the world's largest intact rainforest, rose by 16 percent versus a year ago as the government struggled to enforce legislation and halt illegal clearings.Globally, the loss of forest cover is stabilising as replanting counters approximately 12 million hectares of forest clearance every year, according to U.N. figures.When forests are degraded or destroyed, the carbon they store is released, with deforestation accounting for an estimated 10 to 15 percent of carbon emissions worldwide.On Monday, Germany, Norway and Britain announced a collective aim to provide $5 billion from 2015 to 2020 for conservation efforts in forest countries if they demonstrate measured and verified emissions reductions.

971,"  (Corrects name of Morgan Stanley Institutional Growth Portfolio in paragraph 3)By David RandallNEW YORK Dec 22 Top stock-picking fund managers won 2015 by aiming for brand name companies and avoiding the sector bets that brought down biotech and energy investors.Now, as they look ahead to 2016, these active investors expect to be even more defensive, picking companies like Hersheys Co and General Electric that they say will be able to weather the combination of slow global growth and the first U.S. interest rate hike in a nearly decade.""We're looking for companies that have some competitive advantage that makes them the standard in their industry,"" said Dennis Lynch, a co-portfolio manager of both the Morgan Stanley Institutional Advantage fund and the Morgan Stanley Institutional Growth Portfolio fund - the fifth and sixth best performing large cap funds of this year with returns of 11.5 percent through Monday's close.Lynch's Institutional Advantage fund, for instance, added positions in consumer companies including Hershey, Estee Lauder Companies Inc and Colgate-Palmolive Co in the quarter ending Sept. 30.These types of consumer companies with strong brands tend to withstand volatile markets, Lynch said. At the same time, he trimmed positions in top holdings Amazon.com Inc and Facebook Inc that rallied this year. Other active fund managers that are looking for big names with lots of downside protection in 2015 include Daniel Davidowitz, co-portfolio manager of the $804 million Polen Growth fund - the year's top performer in the large cap category - and Douglas Rao, portfolio manager of the $2.4 billion Janus Forty fund.""There's a lot of noise and volatility in the market right now, and we're in the position of trying to find companies that are less sensitive to the macro environment,"" said Rao.Rao's fund gained 10.7 percent for the year through Monday, a performance that was the 10th best among large-cap funds tracked by Lipper during a time when only 24 percent of large-cap funds have been able to outperform the 0.1 percent gain in the index this year, according to Lipper data.Much of Rao's performance came from his top holding, Google parent Alphabet Inc, which has gained 44 percent for the year to date, and Amazon, which more than doubled this year and accounts for his 8th-largest position. Yet Rao is not searching for the next stock to hit out the lights in 2016. Instead, he expects GE to once again outperform in the coming year as it sheds its GE Capital assets faster than analysts expect and turns more of its focus to segments such as expanding its line of industrial software.""The fact is that we have an opportunity to build a position in what we think will be a best of breed industrial company during a period where the U.S. is going through an industrial recession,"" he said. 'WHEN THE SEAS GET ROUGH' The Polen fund is aiming straight at all-weather stocks: All  20 companies in its portfolio generate high levels of cash flow, return 20 percent or more on capital and show increasing profit margins and organic revenue growth.Along with Facebook, Adobe was the only company Davidowitz added this year to his portfolio, which bested all large-cap funds tracked by Lipper with a gain of 13.4 percent through Monday. Much of that performance came from top holding Nike Inc, which has gained 36.4 percent for the year to date, along with large positions in Starbucks Corp - up 45.6 percent - and Visa Inc, up 17.7 percent.""We aren't built to try to take advantage of rate hikes or oil prices or anything like that,"" he said. ""We want companies like Adobe where it is hard for a competitor to pull their customers away.""That approach may be especially important in the year to come. Since 1945, the benchmark S&P 500 has gained an average of 4.5 percent over the 12 months following the first rate hike of a business cycle, or about half of the 8.8 percent average gain for the index among all years, according to data from S&P Capital IQ.""There's an old saying that when seas get rough sailors prefer a larger boat, and we may have investors gravitating toward larger-cap companies because they expect even rougher seas ahead,"" said Sam Stovall, chief equity strategist at S&P Capital IQ.

The company is taking the three defendants, two of them surnamed Liang and the other surnamed Han, to court, ""asking them to stop infringing on its trademark and is seeking compensation of economic losses of 250,000 yuan ($37,900)"", according to the court statement.Louis Vuitton could not be reached for comment.

The three defendants were selling the goods on Taobao, an online shopping site similar to eBay and Amazon that brings together buyers and sellers, according to the court. Alibaba Group did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The lawsuit comes three months after a U.S. clothing industry group urged the United States Trade Representative (USTR) to blacklist the Taobao website for persistent intellectual property rights violations despite pledges by the e-commerce firm to curb the problem.The three defendants were given unspecified criminal sentences in 2014 for selling counterfeit versions of Louis Vuitton goods, the court said.

Some, like self-described value manager Rupal Bhansali, are gleefully loading up on companies that got beaten down when the whole market sold off at the start of the year.Bhansali, whose Ariel International Equity Fund had been socking away cash for just such an occasion, says she is buying in the most battered areas, including the one identified most often as the reason for the current market selloff: China. ""We're finding value in volatility,"" said Bhansali. Her fund is one of just three U.S. large-cap value funds tracked by Morningstar Inc to deliver positive returns over one year after last week's broad market decline.

983,"  (Rewrites, adds background on filing, Amazon's logistics business)By Mari SaitoSAN FRANCISCO Jan 14 Online retailer Amazon.com Inc's China division has registered as an ocean freight forwarder, according to the U.S. Federal Maritime Commission, a move which allows it to coordinate cargo shipments between China and the United States.The registration is the latest indication that the world's largest online retailer plans to expand its logistics business to cut costs for its own retail business and potentially provide third-party logistics services to other industries. Its new status as a freight forwarder, or ""non-vessel operating common carrier"" means the Amazon unit can subcontract  carriage of cargoes to a ship operator while it takes on legal liability and takes care of customs documentation.Amazon is already negotiating a deal to lease 20 jets to start its own air-delivery service in the United States, the Seattle Times reported last year. The retailer has also introduced its own truck trailers and started a program last year that uses a fleet of on-demand drivers to deliver packages. The Federal Maritime Commission, a U.S. government agency that regulates the U.S.-international ocean transportation system, said on Thursday a business named Beijing Century Joyo Courier Service Co Ltd, with the trade names Amazon China, Amazon.CN and Amazon Global Logistics China, was registered in its database to provide ocean freight services.Amazon China submitted its registration request on Nov. 9 last year, submitting various documents and posting a bond, the commission said on Thursday.

986,"   By Nathan Layne  Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) said on Friday that it would pull the plug on its smallest store format, Walmart Express, and close 269 locations as it contends with higher costs in its home market of the United States and disappointing results overseas. The move includes Wal-Mart's largest-ever single culling in the United States, where the company is closing 154 stores. The other 115 stores are in Latin America, including 60 in Brazil.The world's largest retailer said it hoped to transfer many of the 10,000 U.S. and 6,000 Latin American workers in the closed stores to other locations. Wal-Mart's earnings have been under pressure due to last year's decision to raise entry-level wages as well as higher investments aimed at closing the gap online with Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O). At the same time, Wal-Mart is struggling overseas, where a strong U.S. dollar reduces the value of local sales.The closings come three months after Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon disclosed plans to review global operations and shut underperforming stores. Friday's announcement marks the first step in that restructuring effort.Wal-Mart said the closures represented less than 1 percent of its global revenue. The biggest cuts are in the United States, including all 102 Walmart Express stores.At 12,000 to 15,000 square feet, Express stores are less than one-tenth the size of a typical Walmart Supercenter. The format had been in pilot since 2011 but did not deliver the desired results. Moody's retail analyst Charlie O'Shea described the closures as a long-overdue ""pruning."" ""I've always wondered why it's taken so long to cull the U.S. store base because they really haven't done much of it over the past several years,"" O'Shea said. Wal-Mart said the move would reduce earnings by 20 cents to 22 cents a diluted share, with nearly all of that to be booked in the fourth quarter ending this month. In November, it forecast a full-year profit of $4.50 to $4.65. The company's shares fell 2.6 percent to $61.39.The other 52 U.S. stores to be closed are a mixture of Supercenters, Wal-Mart's largest format; discount stores; Neighborhood Market groceries; and outlets in the company's Sam's Club bulk-selling wholesale chain.The closings highlight the challenges Wal-Mart faces in finding growth opportunities in both its home market, which it has blanketed with some 4,500 stores, and overseas, where it has grown to more than 6,000 locations but has struggled to generate consistent returns.In an internal memo to staff, McMillon said a regular review of the company's assets was vital for growth. ""Doing this ensures we focus and align our resources in ways that build a strong company positioned to win in the future,"" said the memo, which was seen by Reuters.  The Arkansas-based retailer said it would still open 142 to 165 stores in the United States in the year ending in January 2017. For the first time, it also disclosed plans to open 200 to 240 stores overseas in the coming year.The company said about 95 percent of the closed U.S. stores were within 10 miles of another that it owns, making it possible to move some workers to other locations. It said it would provide 60 days of pay and severance for eligible workers not placed.The cuts drew criticism from a group backed by the United Food & Commercial Workers International Union, which for years has been behind a campaign pushing for better wages and benefits for Wal-Mart employees.""Sadly, these latest store closings could very well be just the beginning,"" Jess Levin, communications director at Making Change at Walmart, said in an emailed statement. ""This sends a chilling message to the company’s hard-working employees that they could be next.""

Amazon enjoyed record Christmas trading in Europe. Since 2010, Amazon has invested more than $16.3 billion on infrastructure and operations in Europe, with more than $6.6 billion invested in the UK. It raised the pressure on Britain's established supermarkets in November with the nationwide launch of a packaged groceries service for Amazon Prime members. The move was the ecommerce giant's most ambitious foray into Britain's growing online grocery market but stopped short of replicating its broader U.S. Amazon Fresh service, which offers about 20,000 chilled, frozen and perishable products and items from local shops.However, a recent bid approach by Britain's second largest  supermarket chain Sainsbury's to Home Retail, the owner of Argos, has been seen as a response to the competitive threat posed by Amazon. The new British jobs, which will take Amazon's UK workforce to over 14,500 by the end of 2016, include posts at its new head office in London, and at its three R&D centers, 10 warehouses and 24 delivery stations.

The caption said it showed the two men before taking off for the United States from Saarbruecken, Germany, on Friday.Rezaian, who had been staying in Germany after leaving Iran on Sunday, said he was grateful for his newfound freedom but was not yet ready to talk about his imprisonment.""At some point, I will be ready to discuss my ordeal but for now, I just want to express my profound appreciation for the tremendous support I have received,"" he said in a statement.  ""Today, I am incredibly thankful for my family, my fellow journalists, my colleagues at the Washington Post, and everyone else who fought for my freedom,"" he said.The prisoner swap was announced as world powers, including the United States, implemented a landmark nuclear deal with Iran that eased tensions between Tehran and the West. In exchange for the release of five Americans from Iran, the White House offered clemency to seven Iranians who were convicted or facing trial in the United States. Two other Americans freed by Iran, a Christian minister and a former U.S. Marine, returned to the United States on Thursday.  Rezaian, who was born in California and holds dual U.S. and Iranian citizenship, was accused of espionage by Iran. He and his wife Yeganeh Salehi, who is Iranian, were arrested in July 2014, although she was later freed. Rezaian's brother Ali along with executives at the Post had led the effort to seek their release, urging the Obama administration to press the issue with Iran. After his release, Rezaian spent several days at the U.S. military hospital in Landstuhl, Germany. Rezaian and his family had dinner with Bezos on the base on Thursday, the Post said.""Like all of us, he is incredibly happy they are safe and sound,"" Post spokeswoman Kristine Coratti Kelly was quoted by the newspaper as saying of Bezos.

994,"  LONDON Online retailer Amazon plans to create several thousand jobs in Europe in 2016, more than 2,500 of which will be in Britain, stepping up its expansion in the region, it said on Friday.The jobs form part of an investment by the U.S.-based company to expand its warehouses and delivery network in Europe, its research and development (R&D) capability, and build new infrastructure to support its cloud-computing business.Amazon said it created over 10,000 permanent jobs in Europe in 2015, bringing its European workforce to over 40,000.""We are seeing stronger demand than ever from our customers all across Europe, and we see lots more opportunity across Amazon's businesses to invent and invest for the future,"" said Xavier Garambois, vice president, Amazon EU retail. Amazon enjoyed record Christmas trading in Europe. Since 2010, Amazon has invested more than $16.3 billion on infrastructure and operations in Europe, with more than $6.6 billion invested in the UK. It raised the pressure on Britain's established supermarkets in November with the nationwide launch of a packaged groceries service for Amazon Prime members. The move was the ecommerce giant's most ambitious foray into Britain's growing online grocery market but stopped short of replicating its broader U.S. Amazon Fresh service, which offers about 20,000 chilled, frozen and perishable products and items from local shops.However, a recent bid approach by Britain's second largest  supermarket chain Sainsbury's to Home Retail, the owner of Argos, has been seen as a response to the competitive threat posed by Amazon. The new British jobs, which will take Amazon's UK workforce to over 14,500 by the end of 2016, include posts at its new head office in London, and at its three R&D centers, 10 warehouses and 24 delivery stations.

995,"   By Tom Bergin | LONDON  LONDON Google has agreed to pay 130 million pounds ($185 million) in back taxes to Britain, prompting criticism from opposition lawmakers and campaigners who said the ""derisory"" figure smacked of a ""sweetheart deal"".Google, now part of Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), has been under pressure in recent years over its practice of channeling most profits from European clients through Ireland to Bermuda, where it pays no tax on them.In 2013, the company faced a UK parliamentary inquiry after a Reuters investigation showed the firm employed hundreds of salespeople in Britain despite saying it did not conduct sales in the country, a key plank in its tax arrangements.Google said late on Friday the 130 million pounds would settle a probe by the British tax authority, which had challenged the company’s low tax returns for the years since 2005. It said it had also agreed a basis on which tax in the future would be calculated.""The way multinational companies are taxed has been debated for many years and the international tax system is changing as a result. This settlement reflects that shift,"" a Google spokesman said in a statement.The deal comes as governments around the world seek to clamp down on multinational companies shifting profits overseas to reduce their tax bills.  EU competition authorities have investigated arrangements used by Amazon (AMZN.O) and a unit of Fiat (FCAU.N) in Luxembourg, Apple (AAPL.O) in Ireland and Starbucks (SBUX.O) in the Netherlands, and may start new probes.British finance minister George Osborne welcomed the deal, saying on Twitter it reflected new rules that he had introduced, but others were less impressed. John McDonnell, finance spokesman for the opposition Labour party, said the tax authorities needed to explain how they had settled on the figure of 130 million pounds, which he described as relatively insignificant. ""It looks to me ... that this is relatively trivial in comparison with what should have been made, in fact one analysis has put the rate down to about 3 percent, which I think is derisory,"" he told BBC Radio on Saturday.   ""This looks like another sweetheart deal."" Prem Sikka, professor of accounting at Essex University, agreed. He said that for a company that enjoyed UK turnover of around 24 billion pounds over the period and margins of 30 percent, the settlement represented an effective tax rate in the low single digits for Google. “This is a lousy number and we need to know more,” he said.    Richard Murphy, a tax expert who has advised the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, on economic policy, said the deal was “a disaster” and that, based on the turnover and margins Google enjoyed, “They should have been paying 200 million pounds a year.”Between 2005 and 2013, Google had UK turnover of 17 billion pounds and its main UK unit reported a tax charge of 52 million pounds, filings showed. In 2014, it had UK revenues of around 4 billion pounds, according to its annual report, but has not yet  published its UK tax charge.(This version of the story corrects spelling of Prem Sikka) (Additional reporting by Steve Trousdale in San Francisco and Kate Holton in London; Editing by Dale Hudson)",2016-01-23,AMZN,"Sat Jan 23, 2016 | 10:13am EST","CORRECTED-UPDATE 2-Google to pay $185 mln UK back taxes, critics want more",http://www.reuters.com//article/google-britain-taxation-idUSL8N15700F?type=companyNews

997,"   By Tenzin Pema  EBay Inc's shares plunged 13 percent on Thursday, after a disappointing holiday-quarter performance and a weak forecast suggested that overwhelming competition from Amazon.com Inc was gutting the one-time Wall Street favorite.EBay, which gets more than half its revenue from overseas, is also fighting the impact of a strong dollar, which has knocked the wind out of profits at several companies that have reported results this earnings season.   The stock fell to $23.01 in early trading, knocking off $4 billion from Ebay's market value.EBay is trying to make products easier to find on its website. The company has made it mandatory for sellers to provide detailed information about the goods they offer, allowing it to better catalog and market these products.But that's not enough, Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster said.""To return to industry growth rates, we believe eBay has to go beyond restructuring a product that is lower value than its core competition ..."" Munster said in a broker note. He cut his price target on the stock to $25 from $30.Unsurprisingly, PayPal Holdings Inc - the payment processor eBay spun off last year - reported strong quarterly revenue growth on Wednesday, sending its shares up 8 percent.Amazon aside, eBay is also facing growing competition from brick-and-mortar rivals like Wal-Mart Stores Inc that are aggressively boosting their online presence. EBay has to be more like Amazon and other online retailers who have a curated selection of products, simplified purchase experiences and better delivery services, Munster said.At least 20 brokerages cut their price targets on the stock to a median of $28.

1000,"  SAN FRANCISCO Amazon.com Inc said that sales on Exclusives, its platform for products not available anywhere else, topped $50 million in less than a year since its launch and the site includes more than 120 brands, the first time it has disclosed the data.The sales represents a tiny fraction of those on Amazon's third-party marketplace platform, which allows other merchants to sell on Amazon's site. Third party merchants account for roughly 40 percent of Amazon's total site sales.But Amazon said the store serves as an important avenue for the retailer to get first dibs on new products that could be the next best-seller on the marketplace platform.It is also part of Amazon's effort to target niche shoppers through stores like Handmade, which offers hand-crafted items, and Launchpad, which sells crowd-funded products. Now the company plans to expand the site, which lists 10,000 products including a bluetooth-enabled ""smart bag,"" although it did not provide details.""We do expect the broadening of the product categories and geographical expansion,"" said Peter Sauerborn, director of business development at Amazon who leads the store. In order to be listed on the site, brands agree to let Amazon be the exclusive third-party retailer for their products.In exchange, merchants gets access to the Fulfillment by Amazon program, which refers to the company's global network of warehouses and its fast shipping and loyalty program, Prime. ""There's a whole new group of consumers (the third-party retailers) can draw to Amazon,"" said Seattle-based Christine Boerner, who runs Cielo, which sells fashionable metallic pillholders through Exclusives.At the same time, rival shopping sites are also investing in one-of-a-kind merchandise. EBay Inc is returning to its roots by focusing on unique merchandise sold by smaller sellers.An increasing number of Amazon's third-party merchants are drawn to Amazon's fulfillment program. Active merchants using it grew more than 50 percent last year and delivered more than 1 billion items worldwide, the company said. Stephan Aarstol, founder and CEO of San Diego-based Tower Paddle Boards who was connected to Exclusives on the TV program Shark Tank, is an example of why merchants might be interested in Amazon's fulfillment program.Aarstol said he shipped ""several hundred"" paddle boards to Amazon's warehouse in the United Kingdom late last year and he expects his merchandise to be available to shoppers across Europe for fast delivery, something he could not have done on his own.

1003,"   By Mari Saito and Arathy S Nair  Amazon.com Inc posted its most profitable quarter ever on Thursday but the world's No. 1 online retailer still managed to disappoint Wall Street by badly missing estimates, sending its shares down more than 13 percent in after-hours trading.The results, as well as the company's determination to invest more in new areas and its extremely low profit margins, brought back perennial questions for investors about the company's ability to consistently earn money.""By comparative retail standards, Amazon's level of profitability is still painfully weak,"" said Neil Saunders, head of retail analyst firm Conlumino, who is still positive on Amazon's prospects. ""For every dollar the company takes, it makes just 0.75 of a cent in profit.""Amazon's net profit for the fourth quarter, which includes the holiday shopping season, rose to $482 million, or $1.00 per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, up from $214 million, or 45 cents per share, a year earlier. That figure was held back by rising operating costs. It was well below analysts' average forecast of $1.56 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.The company's shares plunged 13 percent to $551.50 after hours on Thursday, following a 9 percent increase in regular trading. They are still up 80 percent over the past 12 months.Amazon notched its third consecutive profitable quarter for the first time since 2012, but it still left Wall Street wanting more.""The growth story that investors were looking for... clearly Amazon has not been able to live up to the hype,"" said Adam Sarhan, chief executive of Sarhan Capital. Net sales rose 21.8 percent to $35.75 billion, but missed analysts' expectations of $35.93 billion. Excluding a $1.2 billion unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates throughout the quarter, net sales increased 26 percent compared with the fourth quarter of 2014.Amazon Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky defended the company's results on Thursday, adding that foreign exchange rates had an unexpectedly large impact, but overall the company had ""a very strong quarter and a strong year."" Net sales from its cloud services business, Amazon Web Services, rose 69.4 percent to $2.41 billion, compared with a growth of more than 78 percent in the third quarter. AWS continues to be the fastest growing division within Amazon.The company's total operating expenses rose more than 20 percent to $34.64 billion in the fourth quarter. Olsavsky reiterated Amazon's expectation to make continued investments in its cloud division and expand its offering for Prime members with faster delivery and more original video content.""The investments will ebb and flow over time, but our focus on cost reductions and improvement on customer experience will be constant,"" he said. Amazon has historically sacrificed profit, instead doubling down on investment in growth areas like Prime and AWS. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has called these ""big bets"" that are the cornerstone of the online retailer's growth.As a sign of its underlying growth, the Seattle-based company now employs 230,800 staff, many of them in its warehouses, up 50 percent from 154,100 a year ago. Amazon's net shipping costs surged 37 percent in the fourth quarter as it handles more deliveries for its third-party merchants. The company said the number of sellers using the Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) program grew by more than 50 percent last year. Amazon has been spending on rolling out several new services for members of its $99-a-year Prime loyalty program, including one-hour delivery and original TV programming, to attract customers in a highly competitive online shopping market.The company said on Thursday worldwide paid Prime subscribers grew 51 percent. Amazon's Prime program is estimated by some analysts to have around 50 million members worldwide.Amazon forecast sales for the first quarter of between $26.5 billion and $29 billion, or up between 17 percent and 28 percent compared to the same quarter last year. It forecast operating income between $100 million and $700 million, compared to $255 million in the first quarter last year.Analysts had forecast $27.6 billion in sales and $400.3 million in profit.""The stock is getting killed because the Street is too high on next year,"" said Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter.

1011,"   By Mari Saito | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Jan 29 In the wake of Amazon.com Inc's disappointing financial results that sent shares plunging Thursday, analysts blamed rising costs to deliver goods, which increased to $4.5 billion in the quarter, up 24.4 percent from the same quarter last year.And they sharply questioned the company's plans to continue to make heavy investments in logistics, even at the expense of profits.They wondered why it was planning to buy more assets like trucks, and reportedly to lease jets, and worried it planned to spend the money to take on shippers like United Parcel Service Inc.""The so-called (earnings) miss was half fulfilment and half marketing,"" said Michael Pachter, a managing director of equity research at Wedbush Securities. The growing popularity of Prime, which promises free, two-day deliveries for millions of online orders, was one of the factors driving up shipping costs at the online retailer.Rising shipping costs are of particular concern to Amazon, which is the world's largest online retailer. To handle increased orders and speed up delivery, Amazon has opened more warehouses and is building its own delivery system.But Amazon executives asserted on Thursday that they do not intend to compete against carriers like United Parcel Service  and FedEx Corp.

1012,"   By Mari Saito and Arathy S Nair  Amazon.com Inc posted its most profitable quarter ever on Thursday but the world's No. 1 online retailer still managed to disappoint Wall Street by badly missing estimates, sending its shares down more than 13 percent in after-hours trading.The results, as well as the company's determination to invest more in new areas and its extremely low profit margins, brought back perennial questions for investors about the company's ability to consistently earn money.""By comparative retail standards, Amazon's level of profitability is still painfully weak,"" said Neil Saunders, head of retail analyst firm Conlumino, who is still positive on Amazon's prospects. ""For every dollar the company takes, it makes just 0.75 of a cent in profit.""Amazon's net profit for the fourth quarter, which includes the holiday shopping season, rose to $482 million, or $1.00 per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, up from $214 million, or 45 cents per share, a year earlier. That figure was held back by rising operating costs. It was well below analysts' average forecast of $1.56 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.The company's shares plunged 13 percent to $551.50 after hours on Thursday, following a 9 percent increase in regular trading. They are still up 80 percent over the past 12 months.Amazon notched its third consecutive profitable quarter for the first time since 2012, but it still left Wall Street wanting more.""The growth story that investors were looking for... clearly Amazon has not been able to live up to the hype,"" said Adam Sarhan, chief executive of Sarhan Capital. Net sales rose 21.8 percent to $35.75 billion, but missed analysts' expectations of $35.93 billion. Excluding a $1.2 billion unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates throughout the quarter, net sales increased 26 percent compared with the fourth quarter of 2014.Amazon Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky defended the company's results on Thursday, adding that foreign exchange rates had an unexpectedly large impact, but overall the company had ""a very strong quarter and a strong year."" Net sales from its cloud services business, Amazon Web Services, rose 69.4 percent to $2.41 billion, compared with a growth of more than 78 percent in the third quarter. AWS continues to be the fastest growing division within Amazon.The company's total operating expenses rose more than 20 percent to $34.64 billion in the fourth quarter. Olsavsky reiterated Amazon's expectation to make continued investments in its cloud division and expand its offering for Prime members with faster delivery and more original video content.""The investments will ebb and flow over time, but our focus on cost reductions and improvement on customer experience will be constant,"" he said. Amazon has historically sacrificed profit, instead doubling down on investment in growth areas like Prime and AWS. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has called these ""big bets"" that are the cornerstone of the online retailer's growth.As a sign of its underlying growth, the Seattle-based company now employs 230,800 staff, many of them in its warehouses, up 50 percent from 154,100 a year ago. Amazon's net shipping costs surged 37 percent in the fourth quarter as it handles more deliveries for its third-party merchants. The company said the number of sellers using the Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) program grew by more than 50 percent last year. Amazon has been spending on rolling out several new services for members of its $99-a-year Prime loyalty program, including one-hour delivery and original TV programming, to attract customers in a highly competitive online shopping market.The company said on Thursday worldwide paid Prime subscribers grew 51 percent. Amazon's Prime program is estimated by some analysts to have around 50 million members worldwide.Amazon forecast sales for the first quarter of between $26.5 billion and $29 billion, or up between 17 percent and 28 percent compared to the same quarter last year. It forecast operating income between $100 million and $700 million, compared to $255 million in the first quarter last year.Analysts had forecast $27.6 billion in sales and $400.3 million in profit.""The stock is getting killed because the Street is too high on next year,"" said Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter.

1014,"  * Expects multiple deals in multiple territories* Firm missed target of first overseas deal in 2015* Says not in bid talks with Amazon* Shares down 40 pct over last year   (Adds CEO, analyst comment, shares)LONDON, Feb 2 British online grocer Ocado  is confident it will sign multiple overseas technology deals despite missing out on its target of securing a first one in 2015, the firm said on Tuesday.Analysts see securing international deals as the key driver of Ocado's stock market valuation.The firm said discussions with several potential overseas partners to adopt its technology were continuing. ""We are in talks with...a lot of retailers both in North America and in western Europe but also globally across Asia, Australia, even in South America,"" Chief Executive Tim Steiner told reporters.""Some of those deals will take longer to sign-up than others...but we expect to do multiple deals in multiple territories across the medium term,"" he said, declining to be more specific on timing.He was speaking after Ocado met forecasts with a 13.8 percent rise in full-year core earnings. Ocado shares, which have had a rollercoaster ride since they debuted at 180 pence in 2010, have fallen 40 percent over the last year.They were down 5 percent at 250.1 pence at 1420 GMT, valuing the business at 1.45 billion pounds ($2.1 billion).""The investment case is somewhat binary in the sense that without any international deals Ocado looks expensive and potentially strategically weak, but its valuation could suddenly look more attractive and the company strategically very smart the moment a deal is signed,"" said Barclays analyst James Anstead. Media reports have periodically linked the firm with a bid from Amazon to accelerate the U.S. firm's expansion into the UK grocery market.""If we were in conversations with Amazon about a possible bid we would have to disclose that fact to the market, and we haven't done so,"" said Steiner.The firm, whose range includes products supplied by upmarket grocer Waitrose and also has a distribution agreement with Morrisons, Britain's No. 4 supermarket, said it made earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of 81.5 million pounds ($117.2 million) in the year to Nov. 29.That compared with analysts' average forecast of 81 million pounds and 71.6 million pounds made in the 2013-14 year.Ocado had previously reported full-year group sales rose 17.3 percent to 1.2 billion pounds. Retail sales increased 14.7 percent, with growth slowing to 13 percent in its fourth quarter.The firm reported full-year pretax profit of 11.9 million pounds, only the second time it has done so in its 16-year history.

LinkedIn was down 45 percent at $105.67 a day after the company's revenue forecast missed estimates.  Tableau Software was down 49.5 percent at $41.30, also after a disappointing forecast.Big tech names also sank, including Facebook shares, which dropped 5.7 percent to $104.20, while Alphabet fell 3 percent to $707.97 and Amazon slid 6.6 percent to $500.17.

The drop would be the stock's sharpest decline since the company went public in 2011.At least seven brokerages downgraded the stock from ""buy"" to ""hold"" or their equivalents, saying the company's lofty valuation was no longer justified.""With a lower growth profile, we believe that LinkedIn should not enjoy the premium multiple it has grown accustomed to,"" Mizuho Securities USA Inc analysts wrote in a note.Mizuho downgraded the stock to ""neutral"" and slashed its target price to $150 from $258.Raymond James, Cowen and Co, BMO Capital Markets, J.P.Morgan Securities and RBC Capital Markets also downgraded the stock. At least 22 brokerages cut their price targets on the stock, with RBC slashing its target by almost half to $156.LinkedIn forecast full-year revenue of $3.60-$3.65 billion, missing the average analyst estimate of $3.91 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.""This would imply that LinkedIn will grow around 15 percent in 2017 and 10 percent in 2018,"" the Mizuho analysts said.

1030,"   By Mari Saito and Brenda Goh | SAN FRANCISCO/SHANGHAI  SAN FRANCISCO/SHANGHAI Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) is aggressively expanding its logistics operations in China as part of a broader effort to control the rising cost of shipping billions of packages.Its plans in China, outlined in filings there, include handling cargo and customs for goods headed to ports in Japan, Europe and the United States. Some analysts say the move could help position Amazon to offer shipping services to other companies, eventually competing with the likes of United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) and DHL Worldwide Express BV[DHL.UL].That would mirror the strategy of Amazon's cloud computing arm, Amazon Web Services, which is now the company's fastest growing unit. The service was launched to serve Amazon's own retail operations but now hosts data for other companies.Seattle-based Amazon faces increasing pressure from Wall Street to drive down shipping costs, which rose 37 percent in the most recent quarter compared to the same period a year ago.A spokeswoman for Amazon declined comment.The company revealed its China plans in documents filed with regulators there. Amazon registered its Chinese subsidiary, Beijing Century Joyo Courier Service, as a freight forwarder - a type of broker that does not own ships but handles customs and other documentation - with China's transport ministry last year, allowing it to export cargo out of the country. Amazon's Chinese subsidiary also made a similar application with the U.S. Federal Maritime Commission in November. Amazon also filed an application with the Shanghai Shipping Exchange to serve as a shipping broker for 12 trade routes, including Shanghai to Los Angeles and Shanghai to Hamburg, Germany. ""These are major gateway ports,"" said John Manners-Bell, who heads Transport Intelligence, a logistics analysis firm. ""They appear to be laying the foundation for a large forwarding operation.""In documents Beijing Century Joyo submitted to the exchange, the company said it plans to charge customers between $530 and $2,530 to transport a 40-foot dry van container from Shanghai to Hamburg. The rate is comparable to those charged by other forwarders, and the wide range gives it flexibility to adjust its prices based on volume. Forwarders typically negotiate rates with shipping lines and pass them on to the owners of cargo.Last November, Beijing Century Joyo updated its Beijing business registration. The company offers a suite of logistics services such as domestic delivery and handling the import and export of goods.Brian Xue, vice president of operations for Amazon in China, signed the government filings. Xue, who joined Amazon in 2014, has emerged as a champion for its logistics build-out in China.Analysts expect Amazon to use its new freight forwarder license to make it easier for Chinese merchants and manufacturers to transport their goods to major hubs where Amazon has warehouses that ship goods to customers.Amazon would handle paperwork and select the shipping line that will transport the goods and make sure there are trucks on the other end to take shipments to its fulfillment facilities. Merchants will deal only with Amazon rather than multiple companies for trucking, warehousing and shipping. The license also would allow Amazon to cut shipping costs by bundling products from small and medium-sized companies to fill up containers, analysts said. Amazon rival Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N) has been asserting greater control over its logistics network in China, spending billions on buying stakes in package delivery companies and launching a logistics arm that has been investing in warehouses.  Amazon directly imported about 10,000 20-foot containers into the U.S. last year and received an additional 20,000 containers from merchants as part of the company's Fulfillment by Amazon program, according to an analysis by Ocean Audit Inc, a freight auditing consultancy.The program allows merchants to store their products in Amazon warehouses and makes them eligible for Prime, which promises consumers two-day shipping for $99-a-year for goods from merchants who sign up for the program.Some 90 percent of the shipments originated in China, according to Ocean Audit. It's not clear how many merchants have signed up to use Amazon's freight services. Amazon China announced a new, cross-border logistics service to cater to Chinese merchants last October, and ocean freight appears to be part of its offering. But freight forwarders already handling Amazon's suppliers stand to lose business. Amazon could dictate that merchants use its forwarding service, said Cliff Sullivan, chairman of the Hong Kong Association of Freight Forwarding and Logistics. ""We may get cut out,"" he said.  Amazon tried to tamp down concerns about its ambitions in the logistics industry on a recent earnings call, saying it did not plan to ""replace"" carriers like UPS but to handle more of its own deliveries at peak times.But for the first time, the company noted in a recent filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that it views companies that provide ""fulfillment and logistics services for themselves or third parties"" as competitors. The retailer operates more than 120 fulfillment centers worldwide that hold millions of products supplied by third party merchants and Amazon's own vendors and where warehouse workers pick and pack items for shipment. Amazon rolled out thousands of its own trailers and launched an Uber-like delivery service last year to handle the so-called last mile of delivery, taking packages from distribution centers to customers' homes.""At the very least, Amazon will begin handling their own freight,"" said Zvi Schreiber, the chief executive of Freightos, a start-up that provides an online marketplace linking forwarders and logistics vendors. ""The next stage would be to offer the service to third party clients.""  Some in the industry warn companies like Amazon against straying from their original business model.""They're moving into something that could be potentially very treacherous,"" said Andreas Krueger, head of ocean freight for DHL Global Forwarding in the Americas, speaking generally about new entrants into the logistics industry.DHL Global Forwarding, one of the biggest players in air and ocean freight, handles customized logistics programs. ""The worst that would happen is we get another competitor in our midst, but I'm not concerned,"" he said. ""We've been in the business since 1815."" (Editing by Stephen R.

1031,"  (Repeats corrected version of story to a different story number)By David RandallNEW YORK Feb 8 Fund managers who relied on the so-called FANG stocks - Facebook, Amazon.com, Netflix, and Google - to boost their performance numbers in 2015 are cutting ties as the global economy looks weaker than many expected, leaving last year's outperformers in the midst of a deep selloff.The group of stocks that could do no wrong last year now seems like it can do little right. Amazon.com Inc is down 28.7 percent for the year, Netflix has slumped 27.6 percent, and Google parent Alphabet Inc has dropped 11.4 percent over the same time.Only Facebook Inc entered this week with a flat performance for the year before sliding 5.2 percent in midday trading Monday, or about half the 10.2 percent the benchmark Standard & Poor's 500 index has fallen since the start of January.Fund managers say that last year's outsized gains among FANG stocks - Facebook, for instance, jumped 37 percent, while Netflix soared 144 percent - make them the first choice to sell now. The U.S. stock market is down 12.6 percent over the last three months and investors are questioning whether stocks could fall the 20 percent that signals a bear market.""We're moving away from growth because the economy is decelerating and investors are starting to play defense,"" said Phil Orlando, senior portfolio manager at Federated Investors in New York. Orlando said he began selling FANG stocks in early January during the selloff that marked the first weeks of the year and has been moving into defensive healthcare stocks like Pfizer  and Johnson and Johnson that pay high dividends.With so many investors sitting on large profits, the FANG group is the easiest to sell because it is an easy way to lock-in gains while also shifting a portfolio from expensive, growth-oriented stocks, Orlando said. Netflix, for instance, trades at a trailing price-to-earnings ratio of 294.8, while Amazon.com trades at a P/E ratio of 404.9, both more than 17 times the valuation of the S&P 500 index as a whole.Bill Nygren, portfolio manager of the Oakmark fund, said that he sold all of his position in Amazon in late 2015 because it had doubled in price while the retailers it competes with had fallen sharply, suggesting it was fully valued. He used the proceeds to move into financial and industrial companies instead. SAFETY OVER GROWTH The move away from FANG stocks is just one sign that more fund managers are now starting to favor reliable, steady earning companies over the less profitable but higher-growth companies they gravitated to during the earlier stages of the bull market. Utility Consolidated Edison, toy maker Hasbro  and pest control company Rollins Inc have each seen more fund managers adding shares this quarter, and as a result have each gained 3 percent or more year to date.Utilities, meanwhile, which are attractive to investors mainly for their dividends rather than the prospects of share price appreciation, are up almost 13 percent since mid-December, partly on the prospects that a weaker U.S. economy could slow the Federal Reserve's plans to raise interest rates.Still unclear is whether the move-to-safety is in itself a sign that the stock market will improve rather than continue to spill blood. The S&P 500 has gained an average of 18.5 percent in the six months after surges in defensive stocks such as telecoms and utilities, and 28.2 percent in the 12 months following the defensive jump, said Gina Martins Adams, equity strategist at Wells Fargo. Consumer discretionary and technology stocks are the most likely to outperform the broad market in the six months ahead, she said.Eric Schoenstein, co-portfolio manager of the Jensen Quality Growth fund, said that defensive stocks will likely continue to outperform as investors prepare for the first prolonged downmarket since 2009. His fund only invests in companies that have been able to post a 15-percent return on equity every year for the last 10 years, and has its largest positions in PepsiCo Inc, Microsoft Corp and surgical tool company Becton Dickinson and Co.""We've had six years that have unfolded almost entirely as a bull market and people have been taught to pursue momentum,"" he said.

""They appear to be laying the foundation for a large forwarding operation.""In documents Beijing Century Joyo submitted to the exchange, the company said it plans to charge customers between $530 and $2,530 to transport a 40-foot dry van container from Shanghai to Hamburg. The rate is comparable to those charged by other forwarders, and the wide range gives it flexibility to adjust its prices based on volume. Forwarders typically negotiate rates with shipping lines and pass them on to the owners of cargo.Last November, Beijing Century Joyo updated its Beijing business registration. The company offers a suite of logistics services such as domestic delivery and handling the import and export of goods.Brian Xue, vice president of operations for Amazon in China, signed the government filings. Xue, who joined Amazon in 2014, has emerged as a champion for its logistics build-out in China.Analysts expect Amazon to use its new freight forwarder license to make it easier for Chinese merchants and manufacturers to transport their goods to major hubs where Amazon has warehouses that ship goods to customers.Amazon would handle paperwork and select the shipping line that will transport the goods and make sure there are trucks on the other end to take shipments to its fulfillment facilities. Merchants will deal only with Amazon rather than multiple companies for trucking, warehousing and shipping. The license also would allow Amazon to cut shipping costs by bundling products from small and medium-sized companies to fill up containers, analysts said. Amazon rival Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N) has been asserting greater control over its logistics network in China, spending billions on buying stakes in package delivery companies and launching a logistics arm that has been investing in warehouses.  Amazon directly imported about 10,000 20-foot containers into the U.S. last year and received an additional 20,000 containers from merchants as part of the company's Fulfillment by Amazon program, according to an analysis by Ocean Audit Inc, a freight auditing consultancy.The program allows merchants to store their products in Amazon warehouses and makes them eligible for Prime, which promises consumers two-day shipping for $99-a-year for goods from merchants who sign up for the program.Some 90 percent of the shipments originated in China, according to Ocean Audit. It's not clear how many merchants have signed up to use Amazon's freight services. Amazon China announced a new, cross-border logistics service to cater to Chinese merchants last October, and ocean freight appears to be part of its offering. But freight forwarders already handling Amazon's suppliers stand to lose business. Amazon could dictate that merchants use its forwarding service, said Cliff Sullivan, chairman of the Hong Kong Association of Freight Forwarding and Logistics. ""We may get cut out,"" he said.  Amazon tried to tamp down concerns about its ambitions in the logistics industry on a recent earnings call, saying it did not plan to ""replace"" carriers like UPS but to handle more of its own deliveries at peak times.But for the first time, the company noted in a recent filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that it views companies that provide ""fulfillment and logistics services for themselves or third parties"" as competitors. The retailer operates more than 120 fulfillment centers worldwide that hold millions of products supplied by third party merchants and Amazon's own vendors and where warehouse workers pick and pack items for shipment. Amazon rolled out thousands of its own trailers and launched an Uber-like delivery service last year to handle the so-called last mile of delivery, taking packages from distribution centers to customers' homes.""At the very least, Amazon will begin handling their own freight,"" said Zvi Schreiber, the chief executive of Freightos, a start-up that provides an online marketplace linking forwarders and logistics vendors. ""The next stage would be to offer the service to third party clients.""  Some in the industry warn companies like Amazon against straying from their original business model.""They're moving into something that could be potentially very treacherous,"" said Andreas Krueger, head of ocean freight for DHL Global Forwarding in the Americas, speaking generally about new entrants into the logistics industry.DHL Global Forwarding, one of the biggest players in air and ocean freight, handles customized logistics programs. ""The worst that would happen is we get another competitor in our midst, but I'm not concerned,"" he said. ""We've been in the business since 1815."" (Editing by Stephen R.

1041,"   By Mari Saito | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) is quietly inviting drivers for its new ""on-demand"" delivery service to handle its standard packages, as the online retailer known for low prices and razor-thin profit margins looks to speed up delivery times and tamp down its growing multi-billion dollar logistics bill. The move, which has not been announced publicly, is the latest sign that the world's biggest e-commerce company wants to control more of its own deliveries. Media reports have said the company plans to lease its own fleet of jets, and CEO Jeff Bezos  eventually wants to use drones to get packages to customers. Amazon outlined details of its latest plan over the last few weeks in an email to contract drivers who deliver parcels for Amazon Flex, a program launched last year to handle speedy deliveries of common household goods to customers using Prime Now, a mobile app that comes with Amazon's popular $99-a-year Prime membership. They are not Amazon employees. If the gambit works, industry analysts said it could help Amazon contain its shipping costs, which grew more than 18 percent to $11.5 billion last year. It might also create a logistics network to compete with United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N), FedEx Corp (FDX.N) and the patchwork of local carriers which currently deliver Amazon packages.An Amazon spokeswoman confirmed on Wednesday that Flex drivers in Texas are already delivering Amazon.com packages and not just Prime Now orders. The Seattle-based company did not go into details of its plans, but said it will ""explore new ways to provide customers with faster service and delivery partners with more opportunities."" In a recent earnings call, an Amazon executive said the company was not trying to replace partner carriers but rather find ways to handle more of its own deliveries at peak times. Amazon Flex works like on-demand ride-hailing service Uber. Drivers use the app to sign up for shifts to pick up packages at small warehouses near metropolitan areas - as opposed to Amazon's massive fulfillment centers - and deliver them to customers' doors. The program is now available in 14 cities including Seattle, Las Vegas, Phoenix, and Dallas. Three Flex drivers in northern Texas told Reuters they received an email in recent weeks from Amazon inviting them to take part in a new ""opportunity to deliver Amazon.com orders,"" separate from existing Prime Now deliveries. That could be a huge difference for drivers. Prime Now is a relatively niche service with tens of thousands of items, a fraction of the more than 200 million products on Amazon's main e-commerce site. ""This new stream of packages will create new delivery opportunities,"" Amazon wrote in the email to drivers, which was reviewed by Reuters. The expansion appears to be limited so far to select drivers in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.  In order to qualify, Amazon said drivers must have a four-door car that is a ""mid-sized sedan or larger"" and that drivers would be paid an introductory rate of $18 per hour. They can schedule shifts between 8 a.m. and 4 p.m seven days a week. Flex drivers can make between $18 to $25 per hour, according to Amazon. They have less control over their schedule but can receive tips, which is not the case for delivering regular Amazon packages. As contractors, drivers must pay for their own insurance and gas. A Texas-based driver who attended an orientation session for the program, and requested anonymity because he was worried about affecting his status as a driver, was told by an Amazon representative he would need to drive to a larger fulfillment center to pick up boxes for delivery. Amazon's email said drivers who sign up for the new program would not initially be able to continue delivering for Prime Now, but would be allowed to deliver both types of packages ""later this year.""  Routing more deliveries through its own network of contract drivers would give Amazon more control over its supply chain and cut costs. The ""last mile"" portion of delivery - the final and usually most expensive stretch of a package's journey from a retailer's warehouse to a customer's front door – has become increasingly important as shoppers expect cheaper and faster delivery.The move could be especially cost-effective in out-of-the-way areas where smaller, regional couriers deliver parcels to Amazon customers. Such couriers charge an average 35 percent of the total shipping cost, said Rob Howard, chief executive of Grand Junction, a San Francisco-based logistics technology company.""This is a huge competitive advantage for Amazon,"" said Howard. ""It's not a death sentence yet for local carriers but it's a new path.""  (Editing by Stephen R.

The blue-chip FTSE 100 index closed up 1.1 points - flat in percentage terms - at 6,097.09 points. The FTSE also marked its first monthly gain since October.The FTSE came off its earlier intraday lows after China's central bank cut the reserve requirement ratio - the amount of cash that banks must hold as reserves - by 50 basis points to help revive a slowing economy.

1060,"   By Jim Finkle and Mari Saito  Amazon.com Inc has quietly dropped support for disk encryption on its Fire tablets, saying the feature that secures devices by scrambling data was not popular with customers. Privacy advocates and some users criticized the move, which came to light on Thursday even as Apple Inc was waging an unprecedented legal battle over U.S. government demands that the iPhone maker help unlock an encrypted phone used by San Bernardino shooter Rizwan Farook. On-device encryption scrambles data on a device so that it can be accessed only if the user enters the correct password. Cryptologist Bruce Schneier said Amazon's move to remove the feature was ""stupid"" and called on the company to restore it.""Hopefully the market will tell them to do otherwise,"" he said. Amazon has said it intends to support Apple in the iPhone case. Some technology companies filed briefs on Thursday asking a federal judge to overturn a court order requiring Apple to create software tools to unlock Farook's phone.Amazon spokeswoman Robin Handaly said in an email that the company had removed the encryption feature for Fire tablets in the fall when it launched Fire OS 5, a new version of its tablet operating system. ""It was a feature few customers were actually using,"" she said. Digital privacy advocates said that was not a good reason for discontinuing the feature. ""Removing device encryption due to lack of customer use is an incredibly poor excuse for weakening the security of those customers that did use the feature,"" said Jeremy Gillula, staff technologist with the Electronic Frontier Foundation. ""Given that the information stored on a tablet can be just as sensitive as that stored on a phone or on a computer, Amazon should instead be pushing to make device encryption the default -- not removing it,"" Gillula said.

1062,"   By Jim Finkle and Dustin Volz  Tech industry leaders including Alphabet Inc's Google, Facebook Inc, Microsoft Corp, AT&T and more than two dozen other Internet and technology companies filed legal briefs on Thursday asking a judge to support Apple Inc in its encryption battle with the U.S. government. The rare display of unity and support from Apple's sometime-rivals showed the breadth of Silicon Valley's opposition to the government's anti-encryption effort, a position endorsed by the United Nations human rights chief.Apple's battle became public last month when the Federal Bureau of Investigation obtained a court order requiring the company to write new software to disable passcode protection and allow access to an iPhone used by one of the shooters in the December killings in San Bernardino, California.Apple pushed back, arguing that such a move would set a dangerous precedent and threaten customer security, and asked that the order be vacated. The clash has intensified a long-running debate over how much law enforcement and intelligence officials should be able to monitor digital communications.Apple's industry allies, along with several privacy advocates, filed amicus briefs - a form of comment from outside groups common in complex cases - to U.S. District Judge Sheri Pym, in Riverside, California, who had set a Thursday deadline.Six relatives of San Bernardino attack victims on Thursday weighed in with their own amicus brief opposing Apple. Three California law enforcement groups, three federal law enforcement groups and the San Bernardino district attorney also filed in favor of the government.The companies backing Apple largely echo the iPhone maker's main argument, that the 1789 All Writs Act at the heart of the government's case cannot be used to force companies to create new technology.One amicus filing, from a group of 17 Internet companies including Twitter Inc and LinkedIn Corp, asserted that Congress has already passed laws that establish what companies could be obliged to do for the government, and that the court case amounted to an ""end run"" around those laws.Apple, and some of the other briefs, did not go quite that far, but also asserted that Congress, not the courts, needed to address the issue. Congress has struggled without success for years to address law-enforcement concerns about encryption.The victims' families argued that Apple's arguments were misplaced because the government had a valid warrant, and ""one does not enjoy the privacy to commit a crime."" The families also asserted that Apple ""routinely modifies its systems"" to comply with Chinese government directives. Apple has also advanced a free speech argument, on the grounds that computer code is a form of expression and cannot be coerced. The families pushed back against that defense: ""This is the electronic equivalent of unlocking a door - no expression is involved at all,"" they said.The San Bernardino District Attorney's summary argument, contained in its application to file an amicus brief, alleges the iPhone might have been ""used as a weapon to introduce a lying dormant cyber pathogen that endangers San Bernardino County's infrastructure."" The court document contained no evidence to support the claim.Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, urged U.S. authorities to proceed with ""great caution"", warning: ""A successful case against Apple in the U.S. will set a precedent that may make it impossible for Apple or any other major international IT company to safeguard their clients' privacy anywhere in the world.”""It is potentially a gift to authoritarian regimes, as well as to criminal hackers,"" he said in a statement.TWO BIG COALITIONS  The tech and Internet industries largely coalesced around two filings. One includes market leaders Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Amazon.com and Cisco Systems, along with smaller, younger companies such as Mozilla, Snapchat, Slack and Dropbox.That group noted that Congress passed the All Writs Act more than 200 years ago, and said the Justice Department's effort to use the law to force engineers to disable security protections relies on a ""boundless"" interpretation of the law that is not supported by any precedent.The brief also advanced constitutional arguments, saying the order violated free speech, the separation of power and due process. The second industry coalition, which includes Twitter, eBay Inc and LinkedIn, contended in its filing that the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA) of 1994, along with other statutes, has already made it clear what the companies could or could not be forced to do.CALEA requires telephone companies to allow interception of communications, but notably excludes ""information service"" companies from such mandates. Apple said it was rightly considered an information company in this context. AT&T's filing, by contrast, called for a ""new legislation solution"" that ""applies equally to all holders of personal information,"" an apparent reference to the exemption for information providers in CALEA.Semiconductor maker Intel Corp filed a brief of its own in support of Apple. ""We believe that tech companies need to have the ability to build and design their products as needed, and that means that we can't have the government mandating how we build and design our products,"" Chris Young, senior vice president and general manager for the company's Intel Security Group, said in an interview.The Stanford Law School Center for Internet and Society filed a separate brief on Thursday on behalf of a group of well-known experts on iPhone security and encryption, including Charlie Miller, Dino Dai Zovi, Bruce Schneier and Jonathan Zdziarski.Privacy advocacy groups the American Civil Liberties Union, Access Now and the Wickr Foundation filed briefs on Wednesday in support of Apple.Salihin Kondoker, whose wife, Anies Kondoker, was injured in the San Bernardino attack, also wrote on Apple's behalf, saying he shared the company's fear that the software the government wants Apple to create to unlock the phone could be used to break into millions of other phones.Law enforcement officials have said that Rizwan Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, were inspired by Islamist militants when they shot and killed 14 people and wounded 22 others on Dec. 2 at a holiday party in San Bernardino. Farook and Malik were later killed in a shootout with police, and the FBI said it wants to read the data on Farook's work phone to investigate any links with militant groups.Earlier this week, a federal judge in Brooklyn ruled that the government had overstepped its authority by seeking similar assistance from Apple in a drug case.

1063,"   By Jim Finkle and Mari Saito  Amazon.com Inc has quietly dropped support for disk encryption on its Fire tablets, saying the feature that secures devices by scrambling data was not popular with customers. Privacy advocates and some users criticized the move, which came to light on Thursday even as Apple Inc was waging an unprecedented legal battle over U.S. government demands that the iPhone maker help unlock an encrypted phone used by San Bernardino shooter Rizwan Farook. On-device encryption scrambles data on a device so that it can be accessed only if the user enters the correct password. Cryptologist Bruce Schneier said Amazon's move to remove the feature was ""stupid"" and called on the company to restore it.""Hopefully the market will tell them to do otherwise,"" he said. Amazon has said it intends to support Apple in the iPhone case. Some technology companies filed briefs on Thursday asking a federal judge to overturn a court order requiring Apple to create software tools to unlock Farook's phone.Amazon spokeswoman Robin Handaly said in an email that the company had removed the encryption feature for Fire tablets in the fall when it launched Fire OS 5, a new version of its tablet operating system. ""It was a feature few customers were actually using,"" she said. Digital privacy advocates said that was not a good reason for discontinuing the feature. ""Removing device encryption due to lack of customer use is an incredibly poor excuse for weakening the security of those customers that did use the feature,"" said Jeremy Gillula, staff technologist with the Electronic Frontier Foundation. ""Given that the information stored on a tablet can be just as sensitive as that stored on a phone or on a computer, Amazon should instead be pushing to make device encryption the default -- not removing it,"" Gillula said.

Credit Suisse analysts estimate that Amazon accounts for about 30 percent of DHL parcel volumes and up to a quarter of its revenue.However, Deutsche Post's Chief Executive Frank Appel said the announcement on Tuesday of a share buyback showed his optimism for the future of the group. He added that competition from Amazon did not undermine that.""It is good if other companies try to gain a foothold as it shows that our market is very appealing... we view it as a sportsman,"" Appel told a news conference. ""We are very confident that we will be able to continue the positive trend."" The stock was down 1 percent at 1040 GMT versus a 0.5 percent firmer German blue=-chip index, having lost 23 percent in the last 12 months.Amazon set up its first parcel sorting centre in Germany last October and is planning more. It also wants to set up a parcel locker network across Europe to enable people to pick up their own orders, similar to a service offered by Deutsche Post.Ekkehard Hahn, head of logistics firm Mail Professionals told the Handelsblatt daily on Wednesday that deliveries by DHL to his firm's mail distribution centres in Munich where Amazon is piloting its own sorting centre are down 25 to 30 percent.Juergen Gerdes, head of the post, parcels and ecommerce unit of Deutsche Post, admitted the Amazon parcel centre was hurting its business but did not expect the impact to be sustained as Deutsche Post works on new offers like parcel boxes outside private homes as well as improving its same day delivery service. ""It is not that we have any deficits. It is just Amazon trying something new... It is not a question of pricing,"" he said, adding that Deutsche Post's relationship with Amazon was still good and it would remain an important customer.""We are operating a very big machine with a big number of customers,"" Gerdes said. Deutsche Post said 70 of the 100 biggest online retailers in Germany were its customers.Deutsche Post confirmed its expectation that operating earnings will rise by at least 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) this year to between 3.4 and 3.7 billion in 2016, with more than 1.3 billion of that due to come from the post, parcels and e-commerce unit.Deutsche Post also reiterated its long-term targets for a rise in operating profit of more than 8 percent annually up to 2020, including average operating profit growth of 10 percent per year from DHL.""The confirmation of guidance for 2016 and 2020 is a positive signal.

1073,"   By Bobbi Rebell | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Ian Wishingrad may only be 30 years old, but he already considers himself an investing veteran. So when the market began to swoon in early 2016, he kept his cool. It certainly helped that Wishingrad had someone to hold his hand. He works with a financial adviser to diversify the assets he has accumulated as he expands his creative marketing agency, Bigeyedwish.com. ""My risk tolerance is getting lower as my assets get substantially higher,"" Wishingrad says. University of North Texas grad student Rigers Memko, 23, also kept his wits about him and did not sell any stocks when the market fell in early 2016. Memko heads the student investment group at the school, which manages $600,000 in assets. Members focus on long-term investing. Their top holding is Apple Inc, followed by such blue chips as Johnson & Johnson, Altria Group Inc, Coca Cola Co and AT&T Inc. ""The market right now is affected by global uncertainties and what is happening in China, in Europe, and with Russia,  which I believe will pass, and the market will start picking up again,"" Memko says. That conservative investing attitude is proving to be typical of millennials, many of whom grew up watching their parents investments get whacked when the market sank in 2008. ""Conventional wisdom is a younger investor would take more risk,"" says Mike Loewengart, E*Trade Financial Corp's vice president of investment strategy. But E*Trade's Q1 Streetwise report found millennials (25-34) were more bearish than older investors, and more interested in diversification - including a higher interest in international exposure, as well as commodities. Erin Lowry, 26, who writes the Broke Millennial blog (brokemillennial.com), says the careful attitude makes sense. ""If you aren't totally sure how the stock market works and if your parents were burned in 2008, you look at it as gambling,"" says Lowry, who invests almost exclusively in index funds to spread her risk exposure.      Kathy Murphy, president of personal investing at Fidelity Investments, is concerned that millennials are keeping too much cash on the sidelines and not taking advantage of the fact that time is on their side. ""Their money only works for them when it is invested,"" Murphy says.FOUR TIPS Murphy has four basic tips for millennial investors.* Do not try to time the market. Get into stocks, bonds and other assets. Invest for the long-term.  * A target-date fund, which adjusts its asset allocation as you age, is a great solution to ensure your investments are properly allocated for retirement.* Avoid having too much cash. You are ""treading water"" return-wise if you do not invest it.* Use time to your advantage. The power of compounding interest is key to achieving savings goals.   When it comes to individual stocks, TD Ameritrade says the stocks most traded by millennials (18-34) so far in 2016 are Apple, Netflix Inc Amazon.com Inc and Facebook Inc. ""They are investing in what they know,"" says Nicole Sherrod, managing director of trading at TD Ameritrade.    Indeed, Facebook and Apple have been highly profitable for Wishingrad. He sold his approximate $10,000 Apple investment, made as a teenager, for a cool $80,000. His Facebook investment more than quadrupled. Memko, meanwhile, has one big investing regret: That he does not have more money to invest at lower valuations this year. ""This just allows for a better buying opportunity,"" Memko says.(This column has been refiled to fix typos in paragraph 10 and 14) (Editing by Lauren Young and Steve Orlofsky)",2016-03-10,AMZN,"Thu Mar 10, 2016 | 9:39am EST",REFILE-COLUMN-Invest and chill: Why millennials are such cool investors,http://www.reuters.com//article/column-rebell-conservativemillenials-cor-idUSL1N16I10A?type=companyNews

1078,"  * Ocado boosted by hopes for renewal of Morrisons deal* Amazon also targeting UK online food retail   (Adds CFO comments, analyst comments, share price)By Sarah YoungLONDON, March 15 Ocado said it expected to renew a deal with Morrisons this year even though its key customer has reached a supply agreement which will allow Amazon to expand into online food retail.Ocado, which as well as providing supermarket group Morrisons with online services also sells products supplied by upmarket chain Waitrose, said last month that it was in talks with Morrisons to renegotiate a deal struck in 2013.The amendments sought by Morrisons were disclosed on the same day it announced a major tie-up to supply U.S. online  giant Amazon with groceries, raising questions about the future of its relationship with Ocado. Morrisons is using Ocado to distribute its online products. Morrison's separate deal with Amazon is a wholesale agreement where Morrisons will supply Amazon with its products and Amazon will control how much it charges customers for them.Ocado said on Tuesday that the new Morrisons agreement was on course to be finalised, reassuring investors over a tie-up which Shore Capital analysts have called ""critical to Ocado's future"".Ocado's Chief Financial Officer Duncan Tatton-Brown told reporters that the deal would be finalised ""relatively soon"". ""Don't think it's going to be the end of the year before we announce something,"" he said.

Amazon added that it was already working with organizations such as Code.org, the Anita Borg Institute and Girls Who Code to increase women's and minorities' involvement in the technology industry.The SEC ruling comes as technology companies face scrutiny over diversity and compensation equity issues.

1082,"   By Diane Bartz and Clarece Polke | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The fate of Staples Inc's (SPLS.O) planned merger with Office Depot Inc (ODP.O), which U.S. antitrust regulators have sued to stop, depends in part on whether a district court judge decides that Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) will soon become a behemoth in the office supply business.In opening arguments on Monday in the court fight between the Federal Trade Commission and Staples, Tara Reinhart argued for the FTC that Staples' $6.3 billion bid for Office Depot is illegal because the two companies sell 79 percent of the pens, paper, file folders and other ""consumable office supplies"" sold to Fortune 100 companies.She showed emails, with company names blacked out, from firms that expressed concern that the proposed merger would mean higher prices for them. Staples announced its proposed acquisition of Office Depot in February 2015. Reinhart argued that Amazon is not a true competitor to Staples or Office Depot and said not a single large business customer has contracted with Amazon as its primary supplier.However, Staples' lawyer, Diane Sullivan, argued that her client was ""like penguins on a melting iceberg,"" referring to Amazon's 2015 announcement that it planned to enter the office supplies market in a serious way. Sullivan also said the FTC should take note of tough Internet competition that helped force retailers including Circuit City Stores Inc [CCTYS.UL], Borders Group Inc [BDGUP.UL]  and Radio Shack to seek bankruptcy protection.  ""The landscape of history is littered with companies who have been killed or bankrupt by digitized companies like Amazon,"" she said. The hearing is expected to last for up to two weeks. To win a preliminary injunction, the U.S. government must prove that the proposed acquisition will hurt consumers in the form of higher prices or lost innovation.Such a finding would halt the deal long enough for the FTC to hold hearings in its internal court, an extremely slow process. A preliminary injunction often leads to companies deciding to abandon their deal.Judge Emmet Sullivan said it was ""troubling"" that granting a preliminary injunction could kill the deal before it goes to a full trial. ""In reality, investors aren't going to wait around,"" he said.

1101,"  FRANKFURT, March 31 Amazon is in talks with a consortium of German carmakers about taking a stake in high-definition digital mapping company HERE, two auto industry sources familiar with the matter said on Thursday.Last August, BMW, Audi and Mercedes  agreed to pay 2.5 billion euros ($2.8 billion) to buy Nokia's mapping business as part of plans to develop self-driving cars.Since then, the consortium has started negotiations with potential new partners mainly from the automotive industry.Now, online retailer Amazon has emerged as a possible shareholder.""Amazon would take a stake as part of a broader deal to lock them in as a provider of cloud computing services,"" one source familiar with the talks said.The consortium needs the capacity of cloud computing to ensure that maps can cope with live updates on traffic and road conditions using data collected from sensors on thousands of Mercedes, BMW and Audi cars.It has been in talks with cloud computing providers, including Amazon, one of the sources said. Taking a stake in HERE could make sense strategically for Amazon, which is rolling out new one- and two-hour delivery services in major cities in the United States and Europe and needs accurate, real-time maps to compete with rivals for the best logistics.Intelligent mapping systems like HERE's are the basis on which self-driving cars, linked to wireless networks, can perform functions such as recalculating a route to the nearest electric charging station or around a traffic jam or ice patch.For the consortium, having more partners will spread the cost and could improve the volume of data about traffic information being fed to the map from vehicles on the road. Audi, the premium brand owned by Volkswagen, Daimler, the parent company of Mercedes-Benz, and BMW declined to comment on whether they were in talks with Amazon.Amazon in Germany and the United States did not respond to requests to comment.BMW said: ""The new owners Audi, Daimler and BMW have said from the start that they are open for new partners to join. We have noticed that there is lots of interest not only from potential partners from within the automotive industry, but also from other sectors."" Renault and automotive supplier Continental  have both expressed interest.Continental said on Thursday a decision on whether to buy a stake in HERE would be made within the next few months.Ford is also among the companies interested in taking a stake in the HERE consortium, a third auto industry source said on Thursday.Asked whether Ford was in talks with the group about taking a stake in HERE, a spokesman for the company said, ""We have been and will continue working with many companies and discussing a variety of subjects related to our Ford Smart Mobility plan. We keep these discussions private for obvious competitive reasons and we don't comment on speculation.""Self-driving and connected car services could become a $50 billion market, analysts at Exane BNP Paribas have estimated.Germany's carmakers decided to club together to bid for HERE to accelerate plans for self-driving cars after Internet rival Alphabet unveiled a prototype autonomous vehicle.

Online growth was particularly strong in Germany, up 10 percent at 4.4 billion euros, while sales in Russia fell 35 percent due to the weak rouble and were down 8.5 percent in France, where it is restructuring its troubled business.

1112,"   By Svea Herbst-Bayliss | BOSTON  BOSTON Hedge fund Tiger Global Management, known for making big bets on technology companies, slipped modestly in March, leaving it down 21 percent for the first three months of the year, an investor in the fund said.The numbers put the New York-based firm, which manages roughly $6 billion in its hedge fund, among the year's worst performers, a rare misstep for the highly secretive firm. Overall the firm manages roughly $20 billion.For 2015, Tiger Global had a gain of 6.8 percent gain, while most other firms had losses. A spokeswoman did not respond to an email requesting comment.Tiger's top holdings of publicly traded stocks - Amazon.com, Netflix Inc. and JD.com Inc - are all nursing losses for the year.And although many of Tiger Global's top holdings recovered ground in March, that was not enough to offset some of the heavy losses at the start of the year. Two other stocks that regulatory filings show the firm owned at the end of the fourth quarter have had big losses for the current year-to-date. Software solutions company Tableau Software is down more than 50 percent and luxury home furnishings company Restoration Hardware Holdings Inc is off 45 percent.Tiger Global has been making more concentrated bets in its hedge fund portfolio. Last year Scott Shleifer replaced Feroz Dewan, who left the firm, in running Tiger's public equity business.Many hedge funds are still compiling their quarter-end numbers and investors are bracing for additional losses, on expectations that managers got too nervous when the market was tumbling and missed the recovery. Unlike mutual funds, hedge funds do not report their numbers publicly and investors are eager to hear how the big managers performed to get a sense of a trend. Hound Partners LLC told investors it lost 1.9 percent in March and is now off 12.3 percent for the year. Part of the loss is related to the sharp drop in Valeant Pharmaceuticals, a favorite with the hedge fund community.Falcon Edge, which listed drug maker Allergan, energy company Cheniere and JD.com among its biggest stock holdings, said it lost 2.2 percent in March and is off 14.6 percent for the year. But there is some good news. Andreas Halvorsen's Viking Global Investors gained 1.2 percent in March, shrinking its loss for the year to 8.3 percent.Owl Creek Asset Management, whose biggest stock investment is Yahoo, gained 6.1 percent, leaving its year-to-date loss at just 0.8 percent.

1117,"  TROISDORF, Germany Germany's Deutsche Post is testing robots that could help postal workers cope with increasing numbers of parcels on their delivery rounds, a company manager said on Thursday.The volume of parcels being delivered by Deutsche Post in Germany is rising steadily as more and more Germans buy goods online from retailers such as Amazon.com and Zalando. That is making up for declining letter volumes, but posing problems due to the larger size of items involved.  ""Robots could be used in deliveries in three to five years' time,"" Clemens Beckmann, head of innovation at the group's parcel and letter division, said in an interview with Reuters. ""The technology is there.""The robots, which look like a table on wheels on which goods can be placed, would follow delivery workers, helping them to transport and carry heavy parcels. If the postie stops walking, the robot stops too, and it only starts again when they move on. Deutsche Post is already conducting trials of the robots at its depots. It is also considering the idea of using robots as mobile pick-up points that would go and collect parcels from customers.However, that is a long way off because that would require rules on autonomous driving. Still, Deutsche Post is already testing robotics elsewhere, such as moveable shelves in warehouses, and is considering drones to help monitor inventory levels in large depots in China and watch over valuable goods.Around 80 percent of the processes in logistics sites are still done manually, Deutsche Post said.  ""Delivery chains in which people and robots work together will soon be normal and will allow for faster and more efficient processing of goods,"" Beckmann said.

1119,"  SAN FRANCISCO Amazon.com Inc rolled out a new Kindle e-reader on Wednesday, its eighth and slimmest device in the series, with a charger that is built into its cover. The Kindle Oasis, which at $289.99 will be the most expensive in the range, will be available for orders on Wednesday and start shipping on April 27. Since first launching the Kindle in 2007, Amazon has continued to roll out gadgets like its Fire tablets and most recently Echo, a line of voice activated speakers.The Kindle has emerged as the most dominant e-reader in the market as Rakuten's Kobo and Barnes and Noble's Nook struggled to win customers.

1121,"  (Repeats April 12 column. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own)* OECD oil consumption: tmsnrt.rs/1qNdWQ7By John KempLONDON, April 12 Fuel consumption is not very sensitive to a small change in prices in the short run, but if the price change is large enough and lasts long enough the amount used can change significantly.The 60 percent decline in oil prices over the last two years has now been large enough and lasted long enough that it is starting to have a significant impact on the medium-term outlook for oil demand.Most crude oil is used as a transportation fuel in aircraft, ships, trains, trucks and cars, which is where the biggest impact of lower prices on consumption is being felt (""Essentials of petroleum"", Frankel, 1946).Between 2004 and 2014, the apparently relentless surge in oil prices resulted in a sharp focus on improving fuel efficiency.Container ships and oil tankers switched to slower speeds to reduce fuel consumption, a practice known in the industry as ""slow steaming"".Fuel consumption rises with the third power of speed so even a relatively modest reduction in speed results in a big saving on fuel.Slower speeds result in longer journey times and need more ships to move the same volume of freight but shipping lines were prepared to absorb higher capital costs in order to save on the running cost of fuel.Even airlines instructed aircraft to fly slightly slower to save on fuel (""Airlines fly slower to cut fuel bill"", Reuters, Sept. 2014).More importantly, airlines cut weight and fuel consumption by reducing the amount of unnecessary fuel, water and other items carried on board.In another economy measure, airlines reduced ultra-long non-stop routes, which force aircraft to carry more fuel on board (fuel weight is a substantial source of energy consumption).And on land, trucking firms and logistics operators focused on optimising route networks to save on fuel bills while consumers opted for smaller and more fuel-efficient vehicles.The entire transportation system became significantly more efficient, which is a major reason fuel consumption consistently declined in the advanced economies between 2005 and 2014 (tmsnrt.rs/1qNdWQ7).But now the cost of fuel has fallen sharply and seems set to remain low for the next several years, the focus has shifted from fuel efficiency to speed, power and convenience.The impact remains patchy and hard to quantify, but there are plenty of signs that cheaper fuel prices are reversing or at least blunting the former trend towards increased fuel efficiency. SPEEDING UP Fuel economy standards in the United States are improving the fuel efficiency of both cars and light trucks such as crossover utility vehicles.However, the fuel economy regulations specify separate standards for cars and light trucks (stricter standards for cars and more generous ones for trucks).Consumers have responded to the drop in prices by opting to buy more trucks and fewer cars, lowering the economy-wide fuel savings compared with the original projections.The fuel economy regulations assumed consumer vehicle purchases would split roughly 60:40 between cars and trucks by 2016 but instead the split is almost 40:60.As a result, the fuel economy standards are on track to deliver only half to two-thirds of the anticipated reduction in fuel consumption (""Low gas prices expose flaw in U.S. fuel economy standards"", Forbes, April 11).The relaxation of fuel economy is evident in the air where airlines have been adding more ultra-long flights and seat utilisation has edged down (""Long-haul flights get longer"", Wall Street Journal, April 10).Cheap fuel is also helping stimulate a surge in delivery services and has made possible the focus on super-fast home deliveries being pioneered by Amazon's Prime service. Delivery services are the fastest growing part of the freight network at the moment and expected to provide most of the demand growth over the next decade (""DOT releases 30-year freight projections"", BT, March 3).Amazon is investing heavily in building up its own air freight capacity to meet surging demand for deliveries within 24 to 48 hours (""Amazon's airfreight moves raises hopes in cargo business"", Wall Street Journal, April 7).The emphasis within the entire transport system is shifting from minimising (fuel) cost to maximising speed and convenience.Trucking companies are increasing competing to offer faster delivery service to customers willing to pay a premium (""Trucking company's new sales pitch: speed"", Wall Street Journal, April 11).The emphasis on speed at the expense of efficiency is even evident in the growth of rail services between Asia and Europe seeking to win volume from maritime routes (""China-Europe containerized rail shipments gain momentum"", Journal of Commerce, 2015).AROUND AFRICA In the maritime sector, the reversal of the earlier efficiency drive is more ambiguous. The major container shipping companies invested heavily in a new generation of megacarriers designed to travel slowly with high fuel efficiency.The sector is now struggling with a large overhang of surplus capacity thanks to the investment boom and sluggish growth in world trade (""Megaships are worsening overcapacity in the container market"", Reuters, Sept. 2015). In theory, lower fuel prices should allow shipping lines to speed up sailing times and reduce the number of ships employed.But having spent so much on megacarriers designed to travel slowly and efficiently, shipping lines are struggling to keep them filled and have few incentives to increase speed.Maersk, one of the largest container lines, has indicated it has no intention to reverse the slow steaming policy.Maersk points out that ending the slow steaming policy would require major re-planning of its entire network (""Reports of the death of slow-steaming by box carriers are greatly exaggerated"", The Load Star, 2015).But some smaller shipping lines have ended slow steaming and are promising faster sailing times in a bid to win business (""Demand for faster transit times could signal an end to era of slow-steaming"", The Load Star, 2015).Away from the container sector, crude oil tankers are now travelling faster thanks to a combination of higher freight rates on the main Middle East to Asia routes and cheaper fuel.Cheaper fuel costs are also making themselves felt in other ways. More tankers and container ships are taking the long way round Africa via the Cape rather than transiting the Suez Canal to save on canal fees.An unusually large number of ships elected to travel via the Cape rather than the canal during the final three months of 2015, according to shipping analysts (""Cheap oil is taking shipping routes back to the 1800s"", BBC, March 4).EMBEDDED EXPECTATIONS Current and expected fuel prices influence millions of decisions about transport equipment purchases and operations from cars and trucks to ships and aircraft (""Lower oil prices will blunt drive for fuel efficiency"", Reuters, Jan. 2015).Individually, none of these decisions is large enough to affect the oil market, but collectively they have a big impact on oil demand over time.High and rising oil prices between 2004 and 2014 compelled an increase in fuel efficiency and restrained fuel demand even though the full impact did not filter through until 2010-2014.Lower oil prices are now shifting the balance once again in the direction of bigger cars, faster freight deliveries and more routes, in a replay of the late 1980s and 1990s.The full impact of the new equipment purchasing and operational decisions may not be evident for some time but it is already helping support faster growth in oil demand in 2015/16.Capital expenditure and operating decisions will continue to raise demand for oil in the medium term unless and until prices rise again.

1124,"   By Nataly Pak and Eveline Danubrata | SEOUL/JAKARTA  SEOUL/JAKARTA Months after its global rollout, Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) is facing problems in several major Asian markets as it struggles to provide enough strong content to attract consumers amid tough local competition, and also faces many regulatory hurdles, underlining concerns about disappointing subscriber numbers reported this week.From complaints that programming libraries offered in many countries are far smaller than in the United States to delays in offering its signature ""House of Cards"" series in some markets due to rights issues, the U.S. video streaming giant's January launch into 130 new markets worldwide, including a slew in Asia, has been bumpy.When it launched in Indonesia in January, for example, Netflix ran afoul of the film censorship board for carrying content deemed inappropriately violent or sexual. The communications ministry also demanded that Netflix set up a local office and pay Indonesian taxes.State telecoms company PT Telekomunikasi Indonesia Tbk (Telkom) (TLKM.JK) will continue blocking Netflix until it adheres to regulations, Arif Prabowo, vice president for corporate communications at the carrier, told Reuters, declining to give details.Netflix is still available in Indonesia via wifi connections and other carriers.    ""Services delivered over the Internet present new questions for everyone, including policymakers, and our intention is to comply with applicable laws and regulations,"" said Jessica Lee, Netflix's head of communications for Asia.""It is all part of the journey as we roll out in different countries,"" she said.The cost of dealing with these kinds of issues are reflected in its results, which show that Netflix suffered a first-quarter operating loss of $104.2 million for streaming video outside the U.S., partly because of higher marketing costs, and also showed that it is earning less per subscriber overseas than at home.Netflix had 34.5 million international subscribers against 47 million in the U.S. at the end of the quarter. It is unclear how many of its customers are in Asia. LICENSING RESTRICTIONS  In South Korea, where local content is popular and consumers have numerous streaming options, the Netflix site offers fewer than 20 local TV shows or movies.    ""Korean Netflix's library in terms of content is pretty thin,"" said Jung Dong-yoon, a 29-year-old Seoul office worker and subscriber since January.    Netflix viewers in the country also this week discovered that well-known shows including ""How to Get Away with Murder"" and season two of ""Better Call Saul"" were missing - temporarily, Netflix says - as the shows are submitted for age appropriate ratings by the country’s ratings board.    Programming rights are an issue globally.    As of January, Netflix Australia, which launched service more than a year ago, offered just 443 TV shows, compared with 1,157 in the United States, and had 1,585 movies, compared with 4,593, according to Finder.com – fewer than those available in Iraq, Haiti, Cuba and many other countries.    ""With the traditional way in which rights to movies and TV titles are structured, there will be licensing restrictions and the goal is to get to a global library that is the same everywhere but that takes time,"" Lee said.      Vivek Couto, executive director of consultants Media Partners Asia, said it is still early in Asia for Netflix. He  expects the company will ramp up local content and eventually get ""reasonable penetration"" in markets such as India, South Korea, Singapore, Hong Kong, the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam.    ""Markets like Singapore and India, over time, they can do reasonably well, but I think they're going to find more challenging markets like Japan, Korea, China,"" he said.    Netflix has yet to win permission to enter the coveted but highly restricted China market.  SLOWER GROWTH   Netflix this week said it expected to add about 2 million non-U.S. subscribers in the second quarter, below analysts' average expectations for about 3.5 million.    Chief Executive Reed Hastings on Monday cited a lack of local language content and local payment options for limiting initial sign-ups in some countries.    ""Over the next couple years as we further localize, we'll be able to see more opportunity,"" he told analysts on a conference call.    Netflix can take heart from its performance in Latin America, where it launched in 2011 and is by far the dominant video streaming service.     However, it has seen its share of the key Mexican market eroded slightly by competition from Clarovideo, a streaming service offered by billionaire Carlos Slim’s America Movil (AMXL.MX). One of Netflix’s biggest obstacles to growth in Mexico has been the low-level of broadband subscribers, according to one industry source. Broadband availability also looms as a potential concern in Brazil, where the telecoms regulator announced earlier this week that broadband providers would soon be allowed to set Internet usage limits.    In Asia, Competition is intensifying from local streaming sites as well as global providers such as Amazon, Hulu, HBO and BBC iPlayer.    Around the time Netflix debuted in South Korea, local company Frograms Inc launched its own Watcha Play service. Two months later, SK Telecom Co Ltd (017670.KS) made its video streaming service available to customers who do not subscribe to its phone service.Around the time Netflix debuted in Australia, publisher Fairfax Media Ltd (FXJ.AX) and broadcaster Nine Entertainment Co Holdings Ltd (NEC.AX) launched a joint venture streaming service, while News Corp (NWSA.O) and Seven West Media Ltd (SWM.AX) teamed up to do the same. All offered heavy discounts, including free trials.    Netflix had an explosive start in Australia, counting nearly 3 million Australians as viewers, OUT OF A population of 24 million, within nine months of its March 2015 launch. But growth has slowed just as dramatically, from a 55 percent leap between April and May to a rise of 4 percent between September and October, according to Roy Morgan research.

1125,"   By Jessica Toonkel  Turner Communications is expected to announce Tuesday that it is launching its own streaming video-on-demand service for film buffs this fall, according to a company statement reviewed by ReutersTurner, which is a division of Time Warner Inc, is the latest in a wave of media companies to launch its own over-the-top video service to accommodate the growing number of younger viewers who are cancelling cable subscriptions in favor or watching content online, a practice known as  cord-cutting.The new service, called FilmStruck,  will focus on independent, foreign, art house and cult classic films that people know and not original shows as streaming video providers, like Amazon, Hulu and Netflix, are increasingly doing. Turner is partnering with New York-based film distributor, Criterion Collection, which until now had offered all of its 1,100 films through Hulu.FilmStruck will not only feature films like ""Mad Max,"" ""Cinema Paradiso"" and ""Seven Samurai,"" but also will have filmmakers' commentaries, bonus content and stories about the films themselves,  Coleman Breland, president of Turner Classic Movies and Turner content distribution, said in an interview.  ""We didn't just jump into the fray and say let's offer an SVOD [streaming video on demand] service,"" Breland said. ""This is very targeted and focused."" FilmStruck will be managed by Turner Classic Movies. The company hopes to announce pricing for the service within the next 60 days, said Breland. The service will be solely subscription-based and will not have any advertisements.Turner is launching its own streaming online service just months after reports surfaced that its parent Time Warner was in discussions to take a stake in Hulu, which is jointly owned by 21st Century Fox Inc , Walt Disney Co and Comcast Corp's NBCUniversal. The launch of FilmStruck is one example of what customers and investors should expect to see more of from Turner in the next several months as the company focuses on being more consumer-centric, said John Martin, chairman and CEO of Turner.

1131,"  (The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.)By Alison FrankelApril 28 (Reuters) -* The court system in this country is supposed to be open to the public. That's a core principle, codified in the First Amendment and centuries of common law. Yet American corporations constantly push to restrict access to court records.Once in a while, media organizations or public interest groups get involved and orders to seal turn into First Amendment blowouts, but those cases are increasingly likely to be exceptions. Far more often, no one stands up in opposition when a corporation asks to seal or redact court filings.A summary judgment opinion issued Wednesday in a Federal Trade Commission case against Amazon is the latest example of what these routine deletions cost the public.As my Reuters colleagues Diane Bartz and Dan Levine reported, U.S. District Judge John Coughenour of Seattle determined that Amazon is liable to the parents of children who bought items like ""a boatload of doughnuts, a can of stars, and bars of gold"" while playing supposedly free apps.Exact damages are still to be decided, the judge said, ""but the millions of dollars billed to Amazon customers without a mechanism for consent, the thousands of customers complaining about unauthorized charges, and the time spent seeking refunds for those charges, all demonstrate substantial injury.""""LOW-HANGING FRUIT"" And Amazon's strategy was no accident, according to the opinion. When it developed the Kindle Fire tablet, Amazon targeted ""soccer parents"" as a key customer base, describing them as ""low-hanging fruit."" In a marketing document discussing in-app purchases, which the opinion cites, Amazon admitted it knew children were spending their parents' real money on in-app purchases without their parents' knowledge. ""As one Amazon employee explained, 'If a parent gives the device to a child and the child is playing the game and they - they just decide, you know, outside of the parent's view or whatever, to purchase, they could do that,'"" Judge Coughenour wrote.Within a couple months of Amazon's launch of in-app purchasing in late 2011, parents were complaining in droves. Amazon fielded 11,110 requests for refunds, the opinion said, prompting an Amazon employee to state the obvious: ""We're clearly causing problems for a large percentage of our customers.""You wouldn't know any of the details in the preceding three paragraphs if you just read the public version of the opinion Judge Coughenour issued Wednesday. They've all been blacked out.It's only because of a glitch in the execution of the redactions that we're able to see the text beneath the black redaction tape. (As other sites have explained, the redacted text appears if you copy the opinion and paste it into a Word file.) After word of the glitch got out, the judge's chambers pulled the redacted opinion from the court's electronic docket.I could not ascertain who decided what to black out in Judge Coughenour's opinion. I emailed FTC counsel, Amazon lawyers from Venable and Perkins Coie and Judge Coughenour's courtroom deputy to ask; I heard back only from J. Douglas Baldridge of Venable, who declined to comment. EMBARRASSING FOR AMAZON Several months into the case, which was filed in 2014, Amazon and the FTC jointly proposed an order to keep supposedly confidential discovery materials under seal. The judge signed the order in January 2015.Later in the case, when both sides filed motions for summary judgment, Amazon and the FTC each asked the judge to keep some accompanying exhibits confidential. Both requests involved material Amazon wanted to keep under wraps; the FTC doesn't seem to have protested Amazon's assertion that internal corporate memos cited in the government's summary judgment brief should be sealed.Judge Coughenour's sealing orders duly noted the presumption of public access but nevertheless granted the Amazon and FTC confidentiality motions. Corporate ""strategic planning and financial information,"" he said, is ""of a sensitive enough nature that it outweighs the de minimus public interest in access.""Really? A ""de minimus public interest"" in the details of Amazon's corporate strategy to entice children to spend millions of dollars of their unwitting parents' money in order to play supposedly free games? Amazon has now eliminated unauthorized in-app purchases on all devices except its obsolete first-generation Kindles, as Judge Coughenour acknowledged when he said the FTC is not entitled to an injunction against Amazon.Corporate documents debating a now-abandoned strategy don't reveal anything useful to Amazon competitors. They are just embarrassing for Amazon.PUBLIC'S RIGHT TO KNOW The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said in its magisterial Company Doe ruling in 2014, a corporation has no right to claim secrecy just because court filings might damage its reputation - no more than, say, the would-be adulterers who wanted to keep their names out of a class action against the Ashley Madison website.Amazon and the FTC are at odds over the FTC's damages model, which estimated Amazon's revenue from unauthorized in-app purchases to be $86 million, based on an extrapolation involving failed password entries. Amazon says that model is completely unreliable. The judge has ordered additional briefing. But he has already concluded - in words the public was not intended to see - that Amazon caused millions of dollars of injury to thousands of customers. That seems like more than a ""de minimus"" public interest.Amazon competitors Google and Apple stayed out of court when the FTC accused them of similarly luring kids to buy fake glittery game currency with real money. Apple settled for at least $32.5 million in January 2014; Google consented to a $19 million settlement the following September.The FTC filed its complaint against Amazon in July 2014, between the Apple and Google settlements. It's a safe assumption that Amazon and the FTC also had pre-suit settlement talks but, unlike Apple and Google, decided to take its chances in court.Had Amazon settled with the FTC before its case went to litigation, it could have kept its awkward documents out of public view. The company wanted to have things both ways - to go to court and keep ticklish materials under seal. It very nearly got what it wanted.The Knight Foundation reported earlier this month that the journalism industry is too financially strapped to lead the First Amendment fight for access to court records. Public interest groups also have limited resources. That leaves judges as the guardians of the public's right to know - a burden too many judges shrug off.

Revenue in Amazon's three main businesses - online retailing in North America, international online retailing, and cloud business Amazon Web Services (AWS) - swelled 27 percent, 26 percent and 64 percent respectively.The company also offered a bright outlook, with revenue guidance for the current quarter of $28 billion to $30.5 billion, compared with the $28.33 billion analysts expected.AWS, launched 10 years ago, delivered more profit in the first quarter than Amazon's retail business.While AWS is Amazon's fastest-growing business, Amazon Prime and Marketplace, where the company acts as a middleman for third-party vendors, are also gaining momentum.""On the retail side, Prime is the driver,"" wrote Macquarie Research analyst Ben Schachter, who raised his target to $760 from $725 while maintaining an ""outperform"" rating. PRIME TIME Amazon's Prime loyalty program offers one-hour delivery, original TV programming and access to digital entertainment products such as Prime Music and Prime Video for an annual $99.""In both North America and International, Prime continues to thrive and we believe continued investment in original content, expansion in existing markets and the still-large opportunity to add new markets offers lots of runway,"" BMO Capital Markets analysts Daniel Salmon and William Lowden wrote. BMO, which maintained its ""outperform"" rating on the stock, raised its price target to $800 from $700.At least 22 brokerages raised their price targets, to a median of $777.50. JP Morgan was the most bullish with a target of $915, an increase from $822.At that price, Amazon would be valued at $432 billion, making it the third-largest U.S.-listed company by market value, behind Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Google parent Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), both of which posted disappointing quarterly results.At current prices, Amazon is valued at about $317 billion, up about $35 billion from Thursday's close.Amazon shares, which have gained 40 percent in the past year, trade at 98.7 times forward earnings, indicating that investors see huge potential for more growth. Apple trades at 10.8 times earnings, while Alphabet trades at 19.9 times.However, to justify Amazon's current share price, Amazon's earnings per share will have to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 90 percent over the next five years, according to StarMine.

1134,"   By Sarah McBride and Narottam Medhora  Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) on Thursday reported profit and revenue that blew past analysts' expectations, sending its shares soaring in after-hours trading and demonstrating the growing market power of its core retail business and new cloud services division.The results draw a sharp contrast to the disappointing fourth quarter Amazon reported in January, which renewed worries among some shareholders about the company's comparatively thin profit margins. Shares of the world's biggest online retailer jumped nearly 13 percent to $679 in extended trading on Thursday.Amazon's performance also assuaged concerns about a broader slowdown among tech and internet companies after Apple (AAPL.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Intel (INTC.O) all reported disappointing earnings.""It did restore my faith,"" said Dan Conde, an analyst at the Enterprise Strategy Group, who keeps a close eye on Amazon's cloud business. The company also offered a bright outlook, with revenue guidance for the current quarter of $28 billion to $30.5 billion, compared to the $28.33 billion analysts had expected.While Amazon displayed impressive growth for a company its size - revenues last quarter rose 28.2 percent to $29.13 billion, the biggest revenue growth since 2012  - its Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud computing division was the highlight. Revenues at the division climbed 64 percent to $2.56 billion while operating income more than tripled to $604 million.Even though operating margins fell at the unit compared to last quarter, as Amazon spends heavily to compete with rivals like Microsoft and Google (GOOGL.O), they remain a healthy 27.9 percent. That compares to 28.5 percent last quarter, and 16.9 percent a year earlier. AWS, launched 10 years ago, delivered more profit in the quarter than Amazon's retail business. Research firms say AWS has more than 30 percent of the fast-growing cloud-computing market and it remains far ahead of rivals including Microsoft and Google.Amazon said it also has seen strong growth in subscribers to its Prime loyalty program, which offers one-hour delivery, original TV programming and access to its digital entertainment products such as Prime Music and Prime Video for an annual fee of $99. The company said it would ramp up spending to entice Prime customers through video content, particularly its ""Prime Originals"" - shows Amazon develops itself. That strategy builds on the success of programs including ""Mozart in the Jungle"" and ""Transparent,"" which each have won Golden Globe awards.""We feel that program is working,"" Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said in a conference call with analysts. ""We're going to significantly increase our spend in that area."" The company recently launched a monthly subscription to the program for $10.99. Amazon has also said it plans to offer its video streaming service as a standalone service for a monthly fee of $8.99. Amazon does not break out the numbers of Prime subscribers, but Consumer Intelligence Research Partners says the program has 54 million U.S. members. Amazon's growth on the revenue side suggests that the relationship model around Amazon Prime is working, said Frank Gillett, a senior analyst at Forrester Research.Amazon on Thursday also said it would continue to build its logistics operations, where it has started using its own trucks and planes to supplement carriers such as UPS and Fedex and offer-same day service. ""They're still great partners, have been, and will continue to be for the future,"" Olsavsky said in response to an analyst who asked if Amazon would ever entertain delivering items for those companies. ""But we see opportunities where we need to add additional capacity and we're filling those voids."" Amazon founder Jeff Bezos also touted the success of new hardware products. ""Amazon devices are the top selling products on Amazon,"" he said in a press release, citing the Echo voice-response system and the Fire TV Stick.The Echo has been a surprise hit and Bezos said in the statement that the company could not keep it in stock, but he  declined to provide sales figures.Amazon's net sales in North America, its biggest market by revenue, increased 26.8 percent to $17 billion in the first quarter.Amazon reported net income of $513 million, or $1.07 per share, for the quarter ended March 31, marking a fourth straight quarter of profits for the once perennially money-losing company. A year earlier, Amazon reported a loss of $57 million, or 12 cents per share.Analysts on average had expected a profit of 58 cents per share and revenue of $27.98 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

1135,"   By Lauren Hirsch  Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) is investing between $250,000 and $500,000 in Bluetooth technology company TrackR to extend the reach of its Alexa virtual assistant, according to a source familiar with the matterAlexa is the cloud-based system that controls the Amazon Echo, a speaker system launched by Amazon in 2014 that has emerged as a surprise hit. ""Alexa"" is the name the device responds to when users make requests, such as ""turn on radio.""Amazon and TrackR declined to comment on the size of the investment. Like Apple Inc's APPL.O Siri and Google's (GOOGL.O) Google Now, Alexa is designed to answer questions or take other actions in response to simple voice queries. Unlike its rivals, Amazon allows non-Amazon devices to integrate Alexa technology. The investment in TrackR came through Amazon's $100 million ""Alexa Fund,"" which invests in and supports technologies that broaden Alexa's abilities.Santa Barbara, California-based TrackR uses Bluetooth technology to help track lost items. Users put a small chip on an item, such as a wallet or TV remote, and can order those products to make a sound through their phone so that they can be found. If a TrackR customer loses an item out of Bluetooth reach, any TrackR user can connect to the device using the company's network to alert the owner of the lost item. The Alexa partnership will give the TrackR service a voice response capability and will also integrate in the other direction and enable people to find their lost items via the Echo.""The ability to bring on more partners and realize that you are building an entire ecosystem - I think that is what was really important for us,"" said Chris Herbert, who co-founded TrackR with friend Christian Smith in 2009.  TrackR raised $8.7 million last year in a Series A round led by Foundry Group.Amazon has made roughly 15 investments so far through the Alexa Fund, including The Orange Chef, which helps connect kitchen prep devices, and Garageio, which makes a connected garage door opener.

1136,"   By Nandita Bose | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Amazon.com Inc's business marketplace, which connects businesses with suppliers, has generated $1 billion in sales in its first year, making it a significant player in a fragmented industry worth more than $8.2 trillion in the United States.Amazon Business offers U.S. businesses exclusive pricing and discounts for buying in bulk, free two-day shipping for orders of more than $49, tax exemption and the option to get products delivered with an Amazon guarantee.""We are continuing to grow at a rate of 20 percent month-on-month, and that highlights ... how strong the need is in this segment,"" Amazon Vice President Prentis Wilson told Reuters on Tuesday. The business marketplace, which Amazon has described as one of its important areas for growth, extends its role as a middleman for third-party vendors, which account for more than 40 percent of the company's sales. This also helps Amazon gain an edge in the fast-growing online business-to-business sector, which is likely to account for about 12 percent of B2B sales in the United States by 2020, according to estimates by Forrester Research in 2015.Wilson said Amazon added more than 30,000 sellers and more than 300,000 businesses to its platform in the past year and continues to add ""thousands of customers"" every week. Amazon's customers on the platform range from companies like  Cardinal Financial Corp to consumer products makers like Henkel & Co HNKG_P.DE and institutions like the University of California-San Diego and the University of Illinois.Some of the most widely sold products on the platform include computer and information technology equipment, office supplies, lab equipment and food service supplies. Amazon Business has also started beta testing an offer to extend lines of credit to businesses that register on its platform, Wilson said.

1139,"   By Svea Herbst-Bayliss and David Randall | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Against a backdrop of slower economic growth, prominent hedge fund managers, including Larry Robbins, Stanley Druckenmiller and David Einhorn, said it will take longer for stocks to rise and laid out best ideas that markets barely reacted to.     The remarks come as the hedge fund industry has come under fire for hefty fees, sluggish returns and even a lack of talent.Robbins, whose Glenview Capital Management LLC has fallen on hard times with heavy losses early this year and last, kicked off the Sohn Investment Conference, an annual charitable event that raises money for pediatric cancer, with a confession and warning.There would be no new and actionable ideas but his picks from last year, including drug companies  AbbVie Inc (ABBV.N) and Brookdale Senior Living Inc (BKD.N), were still good bets, he said.""While hedge funds play dodgeball, investors go tubing,"" he said, warning investors to stop getting caught up in waves of fear about growth in China, oil prices, public anger over drug pricing and the coming U.S. presidential election.Stanley Druckenmiller, who now runs Duquesne Capital and rose to fame for engineering George Soros's bet against the British pound, hinted that it was time to short stocks and go long gold at a time central bankers were failing to act appropriately. And Carson Block, whose Muddy Waters Capital has built a reputation of uncovering fraudulent businesses, laid out a bet against the Bank of the Ozarks Inc (OZRK.O), saying the Little Rock, Arkansas-based bank was making outsized loans relative to its assets and was too heavily concentrated in real estate lending. Housing starts fell nearly 9 percent in March, offering further evidence of a slowdown in U.S. growth in the first quarter.David Einhorn, who runs Greenlight Capital, talked about construction and mining equipment maker Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N), saying there is little chance for a recovery in the mining industry. While he did not explicitly say that he is betting against the company, he has talked about short bets for the last two years at the conference. ""We don't see a return of large scale capital investment in U.S. coal mining, maybe ever,"" he said.Kynikos Associates' Jim Chanos, who has previously shorted the stock and followed Einhorn as the day's last speaker, joked that he should look at that idea. Chanos said he is betting against mobile phone operator MTN Group Ltd (MTNJ.J), which is facing significant competition in African markets.Some 3,000 hedge fund managers and investors crowded into Lincoln Center's David Geffen Hall in New York, spreading arms and legs to be patted down by security as the presence of protesters sparked unusually tight security. The mood was darker than usual, with the hedge funds down, on average, 1.5 percent this year and some, including Robbins' Glenview Capital Management, off much more. The broader stock market is up roughly 1 percent. Investors, too, seemed unimpressed by many of the speaker's picks, with stocks such as Amazon.com barely moving after being named a top investment pick.John Khoury, who runs Long Pond Capital and boasts an impressive 16 percent average annual return since launching his fund in 2010, pitched Hyatt, saying the hotel chain's high-end business and leisure travelers would protect it from competition from home-sharing company Airbnb. He said he did not endorse the entire hotel industry, but Hyatt's stock price moved little, inching only modestly into positive territory.Amazon, a huge hit in 2015, failed to move higher after Chamath Palihapitiya, who runs venture capital firm Social Capital, pitched it. The company will be a $3 trillion company by 2025, he said, noting that its subscription service, Amazon Prime, is just beginning to find favor with customers. It was also noteworthy that investors talked mostly about names they picked long ago. Activist investor Jeff Smith, whose $5 billion Starboard Value fund just won seats on Yahoo Inc's (YHOO.O) board, talked about pharmaceutical company Depomed Inc (DEPO.O), where he is also looking for board seats. He said  management's desire to stay independent could be harming other shareholders and that it is an attractive takeover target.Meanwhile, Einhorn said he was back into a stock that he has liked before, General Motors Co (GM.N), throwing cold water on the idea that ride sharing companies will take a bite out of car sales. Meanwhile, Richard Deitz, who runs VR Capital Group, said he sees a bright light in Europe and that he is betting on Greek debt and banks, because he thinks banks will be overcapitalized in several years. While fund managers mingled over coffee and cookies during intermissions, protesters calling themselves Hedge Clippers said in an open letter to Sohn management that some of its billionaire guests and presenters are causing cancer by investing in companies that pollute and bankrolling political candidates who are denying the impact of climate change.

For ad-supported videos, the creators will get half of the net ad receipts.Amazon's fast-growing Prime loyalty program already offers original TV programming and access to digital entertainment products such as Prime Music and Prime Video, as well as one-hour delivery of purchases, for an annual fee of $99.YouTube offers a free, ad-supported service as well as a $10-per-month subscription option called YouTube Red.Amazon, though, has a long way to go to catch up with YouTube, the go-to venue for video on the internet since 2005. ""I don't see 50 million Prime users making a huge dent in the 2 billion YouTube user ecosystem,"" Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter said in an email to Reuters.Ivan Feinseth, at Tigress Financial Partners, said Amazon had the technological wherewithal and financial resources to be a contender in any business, but was similarly cautious.""I don't know if it's going to totally disrupt YouTube, or even some of the other services, but for those that are heavy Amazon users, it will have an appeal,"" he told Reuters. Amazon's shares, already up about 57 percent in the past 12 months, rose 3.2 percent to an intraday record of $701.40.Users of Amazon's service will be able to make their videos available in United States, Germany, Austria, the United Kingdom and Japan. The company has also signed up several partners for the  service, including Conde Nast Entertainment, the Guardian, tech blog Mashable and toymaker Mattel Inc (MAT.O).

Oil was up over 3 percent as supply disruptions in Canada and elsewhere overshadowed fears of oversupply.World stock markets had also risen, helped by solid corporate earnings in Europe, progress on Greek debt talks, and a new pledge by Japan that it was prepared to weaken the yen.""Comments from Japan regarding an intervention in the yen and a stabilization in oil prices are helping equities today,"" said Dan Farley, regional investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis. ""We're also at the end of the earnings season and while we aren't expecting a massive improvement in profit, I do expect to see some revenue growth in the second quarter.""At 11:00 a.m. ET (1500 GMT) the Dow Jones industrial average  was up 173.37 points, or 0.98 percent, at 17,879.28, the S&P 500 was up 18.39 points, or 0.89 percent, at 2,077.08 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 32.58 points, or 0.69 percent, at 4,782.78.The S&P 500, which has risen about 15 percent since its February lows, has seen its rally slow in the last two weeks due to underwhelming quarterly earnings and mixed U.S. economic data. However, a three-day losing streak was broken on Friday after a disappointing U.S. jobs report suggested the Federal Reserve would raise rates just once this year. Wall Street also ended mostly higher on Monday as healthcare shares rose.The S&P industrials sector was up about 1.33 percent. The financials index gained 1.21 percent, with  Goldman up 2 percent and JPMorgan up 1.4 percent.Gap tumbled 12.7 percent to $19, the biggest drop among S&P 500 companies, after the retailer reported a decline in sales for the fifth straight quarter.Allergan was up 5.9 percent at $226.46 after the Botox maker reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit.Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 2,082 to 731. On the Nasdaq, 1,564 issues rose and 977 fell.The S&P 500 index showed 40 new 52-week highs and four new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 28 new highs and 36 new lows.

1144,"   By Narottam Medhora and Anya George Tharakan  Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) launched a service on Tuesday that allows users to post videos and earn royalties from them, setting up the world's biggest online retailer to compete directly with Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) YouTube.The service, called Amazon Video Direct, will make the uploaded videos available to rent or own, to view free with ads, or be packaged together and offered as an add-on subscription.Amazon will pay content creators 50 percent of the revenue earned from rental receipts or sale of the videos, according to the company's license agreement. For ad-supported videos, the creators will get half of the net ad receipts.Amazon's fast-growing Prime loyalty program already offers original TV programming and access to digital entertainment products such as Prime Music and Prime Video, as well as one-hour delivery of purchases, for an annual fee of $99.YouTube offers a free, ad-supported service as well as a $10-per-month subscription option called YouTube Red.Amazon, though, has a long way to go to catch up with YouTube, the go-to venue for video on the internet since 2005. ""I don't see 50 million Prime users making a huge dent in the 2 billion YouTube user ecosystem,"" Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter said in an email to Reuters.Ivan Feinseth, at Tigress Financial Partners, said Amazon had the technological wherewithal and financial resources to be a contender in any business, but was similarly cautious.""I don't know if it's going to totally disrupt YouTube, or even some of the other services, but for those that are heavy Amazon users, it will have an appeal,"" he told Reuters. Amazon's shares, already up about 57 percent in the past 12 months, rose 3.2 percent to an intraday record of $701.40.Users of Amazon's service will be able to make their videos available in United States, Germany, Austria, the United Kingdom and Japan. The company has also signed up several partners for the  service, including Conde Nast Entertainment, the Guardian, tech blog Mashable and toymaker Mattel Inc (MAT.O). Amazon has been making a concentrated push into video.In a client note issued earlier on Tuesday, Bernstein analyst Carlos Kirjner estimated that the company will spend about $2.9 billion on video content for Amazon Prime this year.Amazon recently launched a monthly subscription to its video program for $10.99 and plans to offer its video streaming service as a standalone service for a monthly fee of $8.99.

1145,"  * Hong Kong leads regional markets lower* World stocks had best day in a month on Tuesday* Yen buoyed by intervention threats from TokyoBy Saikat ChatterjeeHONG KONG, May 11 Asian shares hovered near a two-month low on Wednesday, as investors shrugged off an overnight rally in global stocks and looked to bonds in the absence of signs of a sustainable recovery in China and other emerging markets.MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan  was flat after spending most of the morning session in negative territory. On Tuesday, it hit an eight-week low.Reflecting the cautious mood in Asia, European shares were expected to open broadly steady.Hong Kong shares led regional stocks lower with the benchmark index falling 0.8 percent, followed by Korea  down 0.03 percent and Taiwan losing 0.3 percent. They are most vulnerable to weakness in the Chinese economy.While strong March data out of China had raised hopes that its economy was turning the corner, mixed data so far in April and surging debt levels in a variety of industries has fuelled doubts about the sustaniability of any recovery in growth. A front page article in the official People's Daily this week that said China's economic trend would be ""L-shaped"" reinforced investors' doubts over the stock market's potential.""You don't expect a bull market in an L-shaped economy,"" said David Dai, Shanghai-based investor director at Nanhai Fund Management Co.Japanese shares were among the rare bright spots in the region, with the Nikkei up 0.3 percent as the yen moved further away from the 18-month highs against the dollar struck last week. Overall sentiment remained cautious.""I'd think the markets are supported by lack of negative news flows. It's not that we have clear reason to be positive about the global economy but there may be a bit of unwinding in excessively pessimistic bets,"" said Hirokazu Kabeya, chief global strategist at Daiwa Securities.On Tuesday, MSCI's broad gauge of global stocks  climbed nearly 1.1 percent, its best session in about a month. The U.S. S&P 500 jumped 1.3 percent, tallying its best day in two months. Bonds remained well supported, indicating investors were wary about the prospects for riskier assets in the near term in an environment of sluggish global growth.An auction of three-year U.S. notes on Tuesday was received well. Yields on 10-year debt were at 1.75 percent, not far away from a 2016 low of 1.53 percent.Japanese government bonds also reflected the cautious undertone in global markets, with the yield 10-year bonds  staying stuck in a narrow range around 0.095 percent.In credit markets, a high yield corporate bond Exchange traded fund (ETF) and its investment grade ETF counterpart  have risen in recent weeks indicating a growing preference for bonds. In the currency market, the yen stayed on the defensive, following two sessions of steep declines after Japanese officials stepped up warnings about potential intervention to weaken the currency.The yen was trading at 108.76 to the dollar, having slipped 3 percent from its 18-month high of 105.55 set on May 3.The dollar got broad support from comments by a top Federal Reserve official last week, which kept alive otherwise diminishing hopes of a Fed interest rate hike following soft U.S. payrolls data last Friday.New York Fed President William Dudley said that it was reasonable to expect the U.S. central bank would raise interest rates twice in 2016.The dollar's index against a basket of six major currencies   rose to a near two-week high of 94.150 on Tuesday and last stood at 94.124, having recovered 2.5 percent from its 16-month low touched on Tuesday last week.The euro traded at $1.13820, retreating further from a 2016 high of $1.16160 tested last week.Oil prices were supported by disruptions to crude supplies in Canada, Nigeria and elsewhere.Brent crude futures dipped to $45.28 per barrel, having jumped 4 percent on Tuesday. U.S. crude futures  were at $44.40 per barrel. Both were off about 0.5 percent.

1147,"   By Nathan Layne | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Wal-Mart Stores (WMT.N) said Thursday it was shortening the delivery time for an unlimited shipping program it is testing to two days from three as it taps a network of recently built warehouses for packaging online orders.The retailer also said it was lowering the annual fee for the shipping program by $1 to $49. The pilot program was started last year, in part to counter the growth of a shipping plan offered by rival Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) for a $99 annual fee.As part of a push to speed up deliveries, Wal-Mart will turn to regional carriers for an increasing number of its packages, according to a person familiar with the matter. That could cut into the share of parcels delivered by FedEx Corp (FDX.N), which handles the bulk of Wal-Mart's packages. Wal-Mart has earmarked $2 billion in spending on digital projects and its e-commerce infrastructure over the two fiscal years to January 2017. Some of that investment will go toward large warehouses dedicated to filling online orders efficiently.The warehouses of about one million square feet in size, big enough to house two cruise liners, will utilize sophisticated computer programs and automated conveyor belts to sift and pack parcels efficiently. The company will open the eighth such facility in Florida later this year. Those warehouses are fed in part by more than 150 distribution centers located across the U.S. Wal-Mart also fills online orders from about 80 stores, where workers pull products off shelves, put them in boxes and ship them to homes. The company generated nearly $14 billion in online sales in 2015, compared to Amazon's $92 billion, according to data from Internet Retailer.

1148,"   By Gustavo Bonato and Roberto Samora | SAO PAULO  SAO PAULO May 13 Brazil's new Agriculture Minister, agribusiness mogul Blairo Maggi, is expected to make policy in one of the world's leading commodities exporters friendlier for business, though environmentalists may still see him as a threat to the Amazon.Once known as Brazil's ""soy king"", Maggi entered Brazil's billionaire club in his 40s, when he ran his father's Andre Maggi Group, a grains trading, logistics and energy conglomerate.He eventually gave up day-to-day control of the business to enter politics, serving his first of two terms as governor of the soy-rich state of Mato Grosso in 2002 and winning a Senate seat in 2011 for the same state.He still holds a controlling stake in the company, once Brazil's largest producer of soybeans. Members of his close and extended family are prominent in agribusiness in the region. His cousin Erai Maggi Scheffer displaced him as the so-called soy king with his rival agribusiness group Bom Futuro.On Thursday, Maggi joined the new cabinet of interim President Michel Temer, who took power while suspended President Dilma Rousseff is being tried by the Senate for allegedly manipulating public accounts. He replaces the outgoing Katia Abreu, who also got her start in soybeans but rose quickly through farming associations to become Brazil's first woman agriculture minister in 2015.Since entering the Senate, Maggi has focused on trying to streamline the bureaucracy he blames with sapping farm sector productivity. He is also interested in modernizing agricultural practices in Brazil, the world's largest exporter of soybeans, coffee, sugar, poultry, beef and orange juice.Analysts say Maggi has enough gravitas to make sure Temer's Cabinet gives the farm sector a fair shake even as the ministries of finance, foreign relations and the environment address Brazil's severe economic crisis.""He has political experience and will not be at a disadvantage when interacting with the other ministers,"" said Luiz Carlos Correa, president of Brazil's agribusiness association Abag, adding he thought Maggi would succeed at opening new commodities markets for Brazil. Soon after Maggi became governor of Mato Grosso, the activist group Greenpeace gave him its Golden Chainsaw Award, saying he backed efforts to destroy forests on the lower rim of the Amazon to plant soy.Maggi denied violating environmental laws. He has since worked to curb illegal logging and deforestation by the farm sector, which he sees as a steward of the environment. He created a program to monitor farms near the Amazon by satellite.But Mato Grosso continues to rank among the states with the heaviest rates of deforestation.One challenge Maggi will face is the pull-back in private credit lines from lenders looking to reduce exposure to commodities in the current market downturn, as well as the higher interest rates and tougher standards required to access government loans earmarked for the local farm sector.

1157,"   By Jonathan Stempel  Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) revealed a more than $1 billion stake in Apple Inc (AAPL.O) in a rare foray into the technology sector, which Buffett has largely shunned apart from a poorly performing investment in IBM (IBM.N). Shares of Apple rose 3.7 percent on the news, closing up $3.36 at $93.88. Berkshire made its investment in the first quarter, before the iPhone maker in April reported its first quarterly revenue decline in 13 years.The investment was announced amid an increasing view among investors that Apple may deserve a lower valuation because its heady growth days may be over. However, Apple has a strong balance sheet and management, attributes long favored by Berkshire.""It makes sense because it's a consumer company disguised as a technology company with a great business model, strong cash flow and a cheap valuation,"" said Jeff Matthews, author of books about Buffett and a principal at the Ram Partners LP hedge fund. ""It's not a leap of faith.""In a regulatory filing detailing most of its stock holdings, Berkshire said it held 9.81 million Apple shares worth $1.07 billion as of March 31.The value of the stake has since fallen to about $921 million, even with Monday's gain. Berkshire's largest technology bet has been Buffett's roughly $12.1 billion stake in International Business Machines Corp, an investment now more than $1.6 billion in the red.  Apple stock ""is stunningly cheap, and it has a massive pile of cash,"" said Steve Wallman, founder of Wallman Investment Counsel in Middleton, Wisconsin, who has owned shares of Berkshire since 1982 and Apple since 2003. ""Apple is not getting credit for research and development it is doing behind the scenes.""An Apple spokeswoman did not respond to requests for comment.MIXED VIEWS OF HEDGE FUNDS  The Apple investment was made by one of Buffett's two stockpicking deputies, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, his assistant said in an email to The Wall Street Journal. Combs and Weschler, who ran hedge funds before joining Berkshire, each invest about $9 billion and usually make smaller wagers, while Buffett, known as the Oracle of Omaha, makes bigger investments such as IBM.Investors said Combs may have been the Apple buyer. He  invested in chipmaker Intel Corp (INTC.O) for Berkshire in 2011.Buffett's assistant did not respond to a request for comment.In April, Apple said revenue for the quarter ended March 26 declined as an increasingly saturated smartphone market hurt iPhone sales, which fell for the first time. Chief Executive Tim Cook is looking to develop other technologies for the Cupertino, California-based company, and last week unveiled a $1 billion investment in Chinese ride-hailing service Didi Chuxing.Apple's market value last week dipped below that of Google parent Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), even though Apple generates roughly triple the revenue and profit. Before Monday, shares of Apple were down by a third from their April 2015 peak. Synovus Trust Company portfolio manager Daniel Morgan, noting that Buffett is known as a value buyer, said; ""That kind of puts the icing on the cake that Apple now is probably considered more of a mature technology company, like we would think of Microsoft, Intel or Cisco.""I don’t think we can put them in the same bracket right now as Google, Amazon (AMZN.O) or Netflix (NFLX.O),” said Morgan said, who owns Apple because of its low price-earnings ratio and high dividend yield.""It's a value stock that has the potential for a big growth,"" said Steve Chiavarone, a portfolio manager at Federated Investors in New York who also holds Apple stock.Hedge fund manager David Einhorn is also a fan, and his firm Greenlight Capital on Monday said it boosted its Apple stake by 31 percent in the first quarter.Other prominent investors have retrenched.Last month, billionaire Carl Icahn said he sold his Apple stake on concern about the company's relationship with China. David Tepper's Appaloosa LP sold its stake in the first quarter, while Ray Dalio's Bridgewater Associates and Chase Coleman's Tiger Global Management slashed their stakes. Leon Cooperman's Omega Advisors also shed its Apple stake, a person familiar with the matter said.BUFFETT ON YAHOO Despite his traditional aversion to technology sector, Buffett told CNBC on Monday that he offered to help Dan Gilbert, the chairman of Quicken Loans and owner of the Cleveland Cavaliers basketball team, finance a bid for internet company Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O).Reuters first reported Buffett's involvement on Friday. While Buffett told CNBC he would not be an equity partner, he could collect dividends or interest on the financing, and perhaps take an equity stake later.""Buffett has always restricted himself from investing in things he doesn't know or understand, and staying within his circle of confidence,"" said Richard Cook, co-founder of Cook & Bynum Capital Management LLC in Birmingham, Alabama, which invests 8 percent of the $350 million it manages in Berkshire.The Apple investment may have been made with proceeds from the sale of AT&T Inc (T.N) stock, as Berkshire exited what had been a $1.6 billion stake.In Monday's filing, Berkshire also reported higher stakes in IBM, Bank of New York Mellon Corp (BK.N), Deere & Co (DE.N) and Visa Inc (V.N), and lower stakes in MasterCard Inc (MA.N) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N).

1158,"   By Foo Yun Chee  BRUSSELS - EU state aid regulators aim to rule on Amazon's (AMZN.O) tax deal with Luxembourg by July, two people familiar with the matter said on Thursday, and it may order the country's tax authorities to recover about 400 million euros ($448 million) in back taxes.The European Commission's decision will come after a near-two year investigation into whether a Luxembourg 2003 tax ruling for an Amazon subsidiary allows the company to pay less tax there than other companies, giving it an unfair advantage.The 400-million-euro figure is a preliminary assessment and may be revised after discussions with other units in the Commission, one of the sources said.The two sources said a panel of experienced officials met recently to review the strengths and weaknesses of the case, a move usually reserved for complex and high-profile cases.  An EU official questioned whether the commission's final decision on the legality of the tax deal would be in line with the current thinking of officials working on the case. The European Commission declined comment. Luxembourg and Amazon had no immediate comment.Amazon overhauled its European tax practices in May last year allowing it to book sales and pay taxes in Britain, Germany, Spain and Italy instead of channeling all sales through Luxembourg. The move could raise its tax bill. Multinational firms face increasing public scrutiny of their tax affairs following popular outrage at revelations of complex offshore schemes to minimize payments. The European Commission, led by former Luxembourg premier Jean-Claude Juncker, has pledged to make rules more transparent across the EU.The EU's crackdown on so-called sweetheart deals involving U.S. firms has been criticized by U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew who in February demanded that European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager reconsider such probes because they created disturbing precedents.This would be the fourth ruling by the EU competition enforcer following an order in October last year to Luxembourg to claw back up to 30 million euros from Fiat Chrysler Automobiles <NV FCHA.MI> and a similar order to the Dutch tax authorities related to Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O). The Commission in January told Belgium to recover around 700 million euros from 35 companies including Anheuser-Busch InBev (ABI.BR), BP (BP.L) and BASF (BASFn.DE) because of their participation in an illegal tax scheme.Other outstanding similar cases are Commission probes of whether Apple (AAPL.O) paid too little tax in Ireland and burger chain McDonald's too little in Luxembourg.

Other competitors such as UK Mail have added extra capacity, threatening Royal Mail's dominance at home.The 500-year-old company, whose red post boxes decorated with the Royal Crest are a feature of landscapes across the UK,  forecast costs associated with the transformation of its UK business of around 160 million pounds ($233 million) for the current financial year. It previously forecast 120 million pounds to 140 million pounds per year until 2018.Its shares fell as much as 5.8 percent and were down 3.8 percent at 488.8 pence by 1040 GMT, underperforming London's blue chip FTSE 100 index. Its shares have gained around 14 percent since the beginning of the year.Analysts also pointed to uncertainties over the outcome of a review of the company by regulator Ofcom, which is looking into whether Royal Mail breached competition law, and negotiation talks over wages and its pension scheme.Liberum analyst Gerald Khoo wrote the higher costs could drag down Royal Mail's results for the year ending March 2017.Helped by tight cost control, Royal Mail's adjusted operating profit before transformational costs rose 5 percent to 742 million in the year ended March 27. Analysts on average had expected 727 million pounds, according to a company-compiled consensus.Including pensions accounting and other one-off items, however, profit fell 2 percent.

Smucker Co, the biggest U.S. coffee roaster, changes prices of its popular retail brands, it usually follows big swings up or down in benchmark bean prices.The company appeared to break that tradition on Tuesday when it cut prices for its flagship Folgers and Dunkin' Donuts coffees by 6 percent.While Smucker cited sustained declines in green coffee costs as the reason for the move, it was notable that arabica  and robusta prices were almost the same as in July, the last time Smucker lowered retail prices. Back then, prices had slumped 25 percent over a year.Rather than a response to raw material costs, experts said the step was more likely aimed at beating off growing competition from supermarkets, whose lower-priced private label brands have grabbed market share from established household names in recent years.The battle with private label brands like Safeway Select, The Kroger Co's Kroger and Costco's Kirkland Signature has been brewing for years. But cutting prices to win customers when benchmark coffee costs have barely changed suggests the industry is prepared to take potentially riskier steps to boost sales.""Coffee brands are seeking market share versus holding prices,"" said Ross Colbert, executive director, global strategist of Beverages for Rabobank International. ""I think Smuckers is responding to increased competitive activity in coffee and looking to regain lost market share.""While Folgers' share of the U.S. coffee market is the largest by far, its portion has fallen for four straight years to 22.5 percent in 2015, Euromonitor International data show.The second biggest coffee brand, Kraft Heinz Co's  Maxwell House, has had its market share shrink for five straight years to 9 percent in 2015.Private label coffee brands as a group, however, has risen for five out of the past six years to command 12.8 percent of the market in 2015.

1164,"  * EU wants more consumers to buy online from other countries* EU to ban online discrimination based on country of residence* Exemption for copyright-protected services such as music* Separate proposal seeks to make postage prices more affordableBy Julia FiorettiBRUSSELS, May 25 The European Commission proposed on Wednesday to ban Internet retailers from treating customers differently depending on where they live to encourage consumers to shop across the bloc for online products.The legislative proposal will apply to e-commerce websites such as Amazon, eBay and Zalando as well as to sales of services provided in a specific location, for example car rental, accommodation and concert tickets. Geoblocking, limiting services to a country or region, is anathema to the EU executive, which last year presented a wide-ranging plan to knock down national barriers in the online world to create a digital single market.""When a consumer enters a shop in another EU country, the owner does not ask for the consumer's ID in order to accept a purchase or to adjust the price or conditions,"" the Commission said in a statement.""But in the online world, all too often consumers are blocked from accessing offers in other countries... Such discrimination has no place in the single market.""Under the proposal, e-commerce websites will not be allowed automatically to re-route customers to their home version without their consent or block their access entirely. Amazon already makes it retail websites accessible to customers anywhere in Europe, and says 98 percent of its own stock is available to shoppers from any European country.E-commerce websites will also not be allowed to prevent customers in another member state from buying products there, although they will not be forced to deliver cross-border.Therefore, an Italian buying a TV off a German website will either have to arrange their own delivery or collect it at the trader's premises. Only 15 percent of consumers buy online from another country, the Commission said, either because it is too complicated or expensive.However the Commission for the time being exempted copyright-protected online services such as e-books, music and games from the geoblocking ban, saying that could change in the future depending on a review.It thus avoided a showdown with the industry which had argued that it could have a waterbed effect on prices if a German citizen could suddenly buy a Spotify subscription in, say, Estonia, where it is much cheaper.In a separate proposal, the EU executive sought to increase the transparency prices for cross-border parcel delivery and to give national authorities the power to assess whether they are affordable.In addition, national postal operators will have to give other operators access to cross-border parcel delivery services.The proposals will become law once they are approved by the European Parliament and national governments.

1170,"  (Adds details)LONDON May 26 Debenhams, Britain's second-largest department store group, on Thursday named Sergio Bucher, an executive at Amazon's fashion business, as chief executive, attracted by his online and international experience.The retailer, which trades from 253 stores across 27 countries but has struggled in Britain's intensely competitive market in recent years, said Bucher would join as chief executive in October, succeeding Michael Sharp, who will step down from the board on June 24.Bucher has served as vice president, Amazon Fashion Europe, since 2013. He previously worked at Puma, Nike and Inditex.Debenhams had said in October that Sharp would leave this year. Under his leadership, Debenhams built its non-clothing categories, such as beauty, shed a reliance on discounting and cut back on promotions. It also added concessions in under-used store space, built up online and expanded abroad.However, the firm has seen little sales or profit growth in recent years, while its shares are well down on their November 2012 peak of 124 pence. Debenhams shares closed Wednesday at 73.8 pence, valuing the business at 901 million pounds ($1.33 billion).""Sergio's wealth of e-commerce expertise, international experience and clear leadership qualities stood out,"" Chairman Ian Cheshire said. Analysts had regarded Debenhams trading director Suzanne Harlow as the leading internal candidate for the job.Bucher will receive a basic salary of 700,000 pounds but could treble that with bonus payments. He will also receive a cash payment of 445,184 pounds as compensation for forfeiting stock he would have received at Amazon.($1 = 0.6799 pounds)   (Reporting by James Davey; editing by Kate Holton and Jason Neely)",2016-05-26,AMZN,"Thu May 26, 2016 | 3:06am EDT",UPDATE 1-Britain's Debenhams names Amazon's Bucher as new CEO,http://www.reuters.com//article/debenams-ceo-idUSL5N18N0TL?type=companyNews
1171,"  MUMBAI India's biggest conglomerate Tata Group launched an ecommerce venture on Friday, as it seeks to cash in on rising purchasing power in a market dominated by deep-pocketed international retailers and startups backed by global tech investors.The group said it developed its Tata Cliq website over a year and a half at a cost of ""several hundred million dollars"" to be a marketplace for inhouse and partner companies to sell apparel and electronics.The move is in line with a second phase in Indian ecommerce development, with the some of the country's oldest and largest corporations entering an industry established in the last five years by startups Snapdeal and Flipkart Online Services Pvt Ltd [IPO-FLPK.N].The market also welcomed global ecommerce firm Amazon.com, Inc in 2013, which has invested over $2 billion for growth.Local conglomerates only lately entered the fray. Reliance Industries Ltd started an online apparel shop last month, while Aditya Birla Group and Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd recently launched online retail platforms. For big business houses, ecommerce is an opportunity to capitalize on middle class growth and rapid internet adoption. By 2025, online merchandise sales will hit $220 billion in India from $11 billion last year, Bank of America Merrill Lynch estimated.But the market has fostered cut-price competition, with the top three players incurring millions of dollars in losses due to heavy discounts.Tata said its focus was profit margins and unit economics, and not just growing sales via discounts. ""We don't want to get into the discount wars, we want to serve customers with great products and build a sustainable business,"" said Chief Executive Ashutosh Pandey of Tata Unistore, parent of the operator of Tata Cliq.To keep costs in check, Pandey said Tata would not use its money to establish a large number of warehouses like other ecommerce players have done, and would instead build inventory networks around existing store locations owned by group partners. The group, whose businesses include steel production, tea packaging, information technology services and automobiles, has bet on new businesses in recent years with mixed success.Its retail businesses including sellers of gold ornaments, sunglasses, apparel and electronics have successfully expanded, but its mobile phone venture Tata Docomo is a marginal player.

1173,"   By Emma Thomasson | BERLIN  BERLIN Shares in German ecommerce investor Rocket Internet (RKET.DE) slid on Tuesday after it reported that revenue growth slowed sharply in the first quarter at most of its top start-ups as it took steps to try to reduce their losses.Founded in 2007, Rocket has spent heavily on marketing and logistics to build up dozens of businesses ranging from online fashion to food delivery to try to replicate the success of Amazon (AMZN.O) and Alibaba (BABA.N) in emerging markets.However, the firm has shifted its focus towards improving profitability this year, even at the expense of slower revenue growth, after investors have expressed concerns that its main start-ups are overvalued and are making unsustainable losses.Rocket has pledged that the 1 billion euros ($1.12 billion)it burnt through in 2015 will mark a peak for losses and promises to make three start-ups profitable by the end of 2017.On Tuesday it reported progress towards that goal as the quarterly absolute loss at its main start-ups fell 23 percent on the previous year to 140 million euros.However, revenue growth slowed as it reined in its marketing spend to limit losses and was also hurt by a fall in emerging market currencies. Sales were up 34 percent at 532 million euros, but down from the 217 percent growth rate of a year ago.  ""Every attempt to deliver significant business operating leverage is not coming through without significant growth degradation,"" said Neil Campling, head of technology research at Northern Trust Securities, who rates the stock a ""sell"".""These businesses don't offer scale, competitive differentiation or high barriers to entry,"" he said.Rocket's shares were down 5.2 percent by 1034 GMT, valuing the firm at 3.7 billion euros, well shy of the 5.3 billion euros valuation Rocket put on its portfolio at April 30.The stock is down 25 percent this year after major investor Kinnevik (KINVb.ST) slashed the valuation for its fashion sites by two thirds in April, prompting questions about the worth of the other start-ups. On Tuesday Rocket highlighted improvements towards profitability at Middle East fashion site Namshi and furniture site Westwing, but admitted that losses widened at ingredients delivery firm HelloFresh - its biggest investment - due to spending on marketing and warehouses.It did not give figures for losses at its second-biggest holding Delivery Hero, although sales rose 91 percent.Chief Executive Oliver Samwer told a conference call for  analysts that HelloFresh should narrow its losses this year and has enough cash to get it through to breakeven point. He added that HelloFresh, which pulled plans for an initial public offering at the last minute last year, was still a candidate for a possible flotation, but said listing any of its start-ups was very unlikely this year.Revenue dropped 37 percent at African general merchandise retailer Jumia and 51 percent at Latin American site Linio, hit by weak currencies as well as a shift from selling their own inventory to becoming commission-based marketplaces.While still upbeat on Jumia, Samwer said Rocket's investment in Linio was limited and it was considering a possible sale.($1 = 0.8958 euros) (Additional reporting by Harro ten Wolde in Frankfurt; Editing by Greg Mahlich)",2016-05-31,AMZN,"Tue May 31, 2016 | 8:47am EDT",Rocket Internet's sales growth slows as seeks to stem losses,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-rocket-internet-results-idUSKCN0YM1FB?type=companyNews

1177,"   By Svea Herbst-Bayliss | BOSTON  BOSTON Investment firm Tiger Global, known for making big bets on technology companies, told clients on Thursday that its hedge fund climbed 2.3 percent last month, helping shrink its year-to-date losses, a source familiar with the numbers said.May's gain, fueled by stronger returns at some of its biggest holdings including Netflix, Amazon.com and Apple Inc, helped shrink the fund's year-to-date loss to 18.1 percent, the source said.A number of hedge funds posted stronger returns in May as some battered stocks recovered, helping them either shrink their year-to-date losses or erase them completely.Despite May's gains, Tiger Global, which manages roughly $20 billion and has some $6 billion in its hedge fund, still ranks among the year's worst-performing funds, according to industry analysts, after its top tech holdings suffered heavy losses in early 2016.The decline marks a rare misstep for the firm, which earned a 6.8 percent return in 2015, according to investors, when the average hedge fund lost money.A regulatory filing showed that at the end of the first quarter, Tiger Global owned a small investment of 275,000 shares in LendingClub, the online platform that forced out its chief executive officer in early May after its board found evidence of falsified data on some loans.  The stock price tumbled last month, and it was not clear whether Tiger Global still held the position in May.2016 has shaped up as the worst year since the financial crisis for hedge funds, with poor returns prompting investors to  pull out roughly $17 billion in assets during the first quarter, eVestment data show.Viking Global Investors, run by Andreas Halvorsen, had a strong May as its fund climbed 5.7 percent, shrinking its year-to-date loss to 2.8 percent, a person familiar with the number said. Some of its biggest holdings, including Alphabet Inc and Amazon.com rebounded in May. Fund manager Mark Kingdon also shrunk his year-to-date loss with a strong gain in May. The Kingdon Global Long/Short Equity fund climbed 5.24 percent last month, leaving it off 3.16 percent for the year, a person familiar with the numbers said.Clint Carlson's  Carlson Capital's flagship multi-strategy Double Black Diamond fund moved into the black in May.The fund climbed 2.3 percent in the month and is up 1.24 percent for the year, a person familiar with the numbers said. The firm's $1.1 billion equity long-short Black Diamond Thematic fund rose 3.64 percent in May, extending its year-to-date gains to 13.25 percent. Carlson Capital oversees $9 billion in assets.Reade Griffith's Polygon European Equity Opportunity Fund, which manages $650 million, gained 2.3 percent in May, extending its year-to-date gain to 8.9 percent, a person who has seen the numbers said.Renaissance Technologies, one of the world's most prominent hedge funds with roughly $27 billion in assets, posted small gains in its Renaissance Institutional Equities fund, known as RIEF, inching up 0.59 percent last month. For the year, the fund is up 8.74 percent.

1179,"   By Jessica Toonkel and Ross Kerber  Media investors are looking beyond the legal battle between the Redstone family and Viacom Inc VIABO> CEO Philippe Dauman, speculating that a deal for the $18 billion media conglomerate could be on the horizon.Last month, Sumner Redstone, 93, the controlling shareholder of Viacom and CBS Corp (CBS.N), changed key members of his seven-person trust that will take over his majority voting stake of CBS and Viacom when he dies or is deemed incapacitated, and he signaled he may dismiss the Viacom board and Dauman.That led to new allegations, this time from Dauman, that the home-bound mogul is mentally incompetent. In a previous lawsuit filed by a former Redstone girlfriend, Dauman testified that Redstone was ""engaged"" and ""alert.""There is no evidence that a deal for Viacom is in the works. Still, investors have bid up shares of Viacom about 16 percent since May 20 when Redstone removed Dauman from the seven-person trust that will eventually control CBS and Viacom.A Viacom spokesman and a spokesman for Sumner Redstone declined to comment. A spokeswoman for Redstone's daughter, Shari Redstone, declined to comment. Shari Redstone, who sits on her father's trust, opposed Dauman's elevation to Viacom executive chair earlier this year. Dauman is fighting his ouster from the trust in court, asserting that Redstone's diminished mental capacity left him vulnerable to his daughter's improper influence. But many investors expect he will leave Viacom.“I don’t see how he would stick around,” said Ben Strubel, a principal with Lancaster, Pennsylvania-based wealth manager Strubel Investment Management, which owns non-voting shares of Viacom.The thinking among investors is that if Dauman leaves, Viacom's fate would be in play.One scenario would be Viacom merging back into CBS(CBS.N), 10 years after the companies split, Strubel said.“I think Viacom recombined with CBS is the most natural fit,” he said.CBS would have better bargaining power with distributors, with the added heft, Strubel and other investors and analysts said. And some hope that Viacom programing would improve under Leslie Moonves, the CBS chief executive who has presided over a successful era for the television network.Other investors said they want Viacom put up for sale in an open auction and believe suitors could include Discovery Communications (DISCA.O), AMC Entertainment Holdings (AMC.N) and companies that may be interested in getting into programing, such as Apple Inc(AAPL.O), Dish Network Corp(DISH.O) and Verizon Communications Inc(VZ.N). The battle over control of Viacom is playing out at a time when the growth of streaming video providers like Netflix and Amazon is putting pressure on networks and cable companies to offer smaller, lower-cost packages of channels.The environment leaves Viacom, as a stand-alone company, little time to pull off a turn-around and improve its ratings and overall performance, said Christopher Marangi, a portfolio manager for Rye, New York-based GAMCO Investors Inc, the second largest owner of voting shares of Viacom after the Redstone family.""Time is of the essence,"" Marangi said in an interview. He declined to comment on his preferences for Viacom's future.GAMCO CEO Mario Gabelli said in an interview in May that he gives Dauman six months to turn the company around. He declined to say what would happen if there was no improvement in that time.Viacom owns MTV, Nickelodeon, Comedy Central and the Paramount movie studio. Shares in the company have fallen nearly 50 percent in the past two years even with the most recent uptick. Dauman has told investors he plans to pay down debt by selling a minority stake in Paramount, a move that Redstone opposed, according to his spokesman.On Monday, National Amusements, the Redstone family business that holds its Viacom stake, changed Viacom's bylaws to require unanimous Viacom board support for any Paramount-related transaction. A Viacom spokesman said the bylaw changes were illegitimate. BRINGING THE BAND BACK TOGETHER Late last month, Redstone suggested in a statement issued through a spokesman that he was considering ousting Dauman and Viacom's board [ID:nL2N18O19H], increasing speculation that he is considering merging Viacom back into CBS. Shari Redstone has expressed strong support for Moonves as CEO and executive chair of CBS. A combined CBS-Viacom could save more than $200 million in costs, according to BTIG Analyst Richard Greenfield. ""If things are going to continue to move into smaller bundles of channels, the fastest way to protect Viacom is for it to merge,"" Greenfield told Reuters. A CBS spokesman declined to comment. Moonves, seen as key to the deal, has not said he wants to run the two companies. Not all CBS shareholders are certain that such a deal makes sense.""We would have to assess it more from the side of CBS to make sure they weren't investing in a bad deal,"" Michael Cuggino, president and portfolio manager at San Francisco-based Permanent Portfolio Family of Funds, which owns voting shares of CBS and Viacom, told Reuters.Salvatore Muoio, principal with New York-based S. Muoio & Co, a major owner of Viacom voting shares, said a bidding process for Viacom would realize the most value.Viacom could give companies such as AMC and Discovery programing and scale to better negotiate for higher fees from cable and satellite distributors, Muoio said.Representatives for Verizon, Apple and Discovery declined to comment. E-mails to AMC were not returned.Absent a deal, Viacom may continue to face skeptical investors, such as John Heinlein, Chief Executive of Horan Capital Management, which sold out of Viacom in May over what Heinlein called ""too many issues confronting the company.""""I do believe a major shakeup of management is needed and an ultimate sale could possibly help unlock some of the underlying value,"" Heinlein said via e-mail.

1181,"   By Aradhana Aravindan and Fransiska Nangoy | SINGAPORE/JAKARTA  SINGAPORE/JAKARTA Indonesian online retailer Bilna spent two years looking for a chief technology officer before it finally discovered Ridy Lie, who had returned home after eight years with Amazon in the United States.Until Lie, the company had struggled to find someone who could ""take us to the next level,"" said Eka Himawan, group chief financial officer at the company, which was renamed Orami after a merger this year.    ""He is the one who is guiding (the engineers) and telling them: this is how the things are done in Amazon and this is how we should do it,"" Himawan said. Even as internet giants like Alibaba and SoftBank are making major investments in startups heavily exposed to Indonesia, recruitment of talented executives is proving to be a huge drag on the country's technology sector.Indonesia is the most populous country in a region where 3.8 million internet users are coming online every month. A recent report by Google and Singaporean state fund Temasek [TEM.UL] estimated that Southeast Asia needed to attract investment worth $40-50 billion in sectors such as ecommerce over the next decade to potentially become a $200 billion internet economy, with Indonesia poised to receive a big chunk.But the tech talent needed to drive such growth is scarce, the result mainly of shortcomings in Indonesia's education system, a lack of experience and the low salaries on offer compared with those available in the United States.Highly skilled workers account for only about 10 percent of total employment in the archipelago of 250 million people, the lowest ratio of any major Southeast Asian nation, according to the World Economic Forum.""I would say it definitely means things grow slower. If I compare a startup in Indonesia with startups in some other places, they will tend to be less on the cutting edge of technology, less efficient,"" said Vinnie Lauria, a founding partner at Singapore-based Golden Gate Ventures.Some investors are offshoring tech work to fill the talent gap as they seek to grow startups. So far, however, no private Indonesian tech firm has reached a valuation of more than $1 billion, compared with more than 20 in China.   ""The solution of last resort is to solve the problem out of the country,"" Adrian Vanzyl, CEO of Thailand-based Ardent Capital, told Reuters in April.Ardent has invested in Thai logistics firm aCommerce, which has engineers in Indonesia but leaves ""a lot of the core platform development"" to staff in Thailand, he said.Another creative work-around is a fly-in-fly-out approach to get people with specialized knowledge to advise local startups on a temporary basis.""Spend three or six months ... to help the company scale,"" Chua Kee Lock, chief executive at Vertex Venture Holdings, part of Temasek, told Reuters. HURDLES AHEAD Skills shortages are only one of many challenges startups and technology investors face in Indonesia. Others range from difficulties in finding materials for training engineers to poor logistics and frequent policy flipflops.When Jakarta's taxi drivers protested violently against ride-hailing apps like Grab and Uber in April, the government bowed to pressure and forced the tech firms to partner with local transportation companies. The government is also trying to pursue back-taxes from Yahoo and Twitter, and has ordered companies that deliver content over the internet to establish Indonesian offices and pay Indonesian taxes. Indonesia ranks 109 out of 189 countries in terms of ease of doing business, according to a World Bank Study, below neighbors such as Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam. But for startups and their investors, the talent shortage is the biggest headache.""Getting good people is tough. The education system is mismatched - what's taught in university isn't much in use at work,"" said Lie, who worked in a development engineering team at Amazon before joining Orami.The government plans to tackle the skills shortage by putting coding on the public school curriculum and through knowledge transfers from foreign investors.""There is plenty of capital available ... and Indonesia is exploding on every possible level,"" said Vanzyl at Ardent.""Why are things growing less fast than they can? The answer is talent shortage. That is the number one factor.""

1182,"   By James Davey | LONDON  LONDON Amazon (AMZN.O) has launched a British version of its U.S. AmazonFresh food delivery service, stepping up the pressure on the traditional big supermarkets already locked in a brutal price war.In a long-anticipated move to break into Britain's 178 billion pounds ($257 billion) grocery market, the world's largest online retailer launched AmazonFresh on Thursday in parts of central and east London.Britain has one of the world's most developed online grocery markets with the big four retailers Tesco (TSCO.L), Sainsbury's (SBRY.L), Wal-Mart's (WMT.N) Asda and Morrisons (MRW.L) already competing with specialist delivery firm Ocado (OCDO.L).The online grocery bar is even higher in the capital.""The entry of AmazonFresh into the UK doesn't come out of the blue but it will further worry investors about the fundamentals and prospects of the UK food retail market,"" said Bernstein analysts, who estimate Amazon could eventually take up to 13 percent of all food sales in the country.Britain's online food market is expected to nearly double to 17.2 billion pounds in the five years to 2020, according to industry research group IGD.""We are launching with a comprehensive offer in a limited area and will take our time to hone and improve our service,"" AmazonFresh vice president Ajay Kavan said.AmazonFresh will initially offer a full grocery service from a distribution center in the east of the capital. It plans to use small and medium-sized external carriers for deliveries, which could be on the same day as the order. UK ROLLOUT Shares in Britain's listed supermarkets have been hammered in recent years as the grocery market has been convulsed by changing shopping habits, the rise of German discounters Aldi and Lidl and price competition, and analysts see AmazonFresh as a potential challenge to the whole industry over time.""We will be very methodical and considered in how we roll this service out further in the UK,"" Kavan said.Shoppers in the eligible London districts, or postcodes, who are members of the Amazon Prime subscription service will be able to choose from a range of more than 130,000 products, including about 20,000 grocery items. Amazon will offer fresh and frozen products from Morrisons, with which it struck a wholesale supply deal in February, brands including Coca-Cola, Kellogg's, Danone, Warburtons and Walkers as well as products from local food producers and shops in locations such as London's trendy Borough Market.Amazon Prime members in the United Kingdom pay an annual subscription of 79 pounds. They can sign up for a 30-day trial of AmazonFresh and would then pay 6.99 pounds per month for the service, with unlimited deliveries for orders over 40 pounds.IMPACT     In the short term, Bernstein analysts reckon AmazonFresh's focus on London and its upmarket bias could mean Sainsbury's is hit the most out of the Big Four. But they said Tesco and Ocado are also exposed as they have the largest share of London-based online food sales. There was, however, little impact on stock prices following the AmazonFresh launch.In April, Sainsbury's agreed a 1.4 billion pound takeover of Argos, a move which was seen as a defensive play against Amazon.One food retail executive from one of the big four players said Amazon would only significantly disrupt the market if it could successfully target the 60 percent of store sales that are just small baskets.""If Amazon can work out how to deliver those top up shops profitably and in a timely manner then I think we'll see other retailers respond and that's likely to grow the overall market share of online sales from around the 7 percent mark and accelerate the growth,"" he told Reuters.Amazon launched a fresh food delivery service in Seattle in 2007 and has since moved to a handful of other U.S. cities, but it has struggled to find the best pricing model.It has offered some food and drink items to British customers since 2010, and in November extended a packaged groceries offer already available in Germany and Japan to Prime members in Britain.

1184,"   By James Davey | LONDON, June 9  LONDON, June 9 Amazon launched a British version of its AmazonFresh food delivery service on Thursday in a long-anticipated move by the world's largest online retailer to break into the UK grocery market.Britain has one of the world's most developed online markets, with the big four supermarkets Tesco, Sainsbury's, Wal-Mart's Asda and Morrisons  competing with specialist delivery firm Ocado.The market is nevertheless predicted to nearly double to 17.2 billion pounds ($25 billion) in the five years to 2020, according to industry research group IGD.""We are launching with a comprehensive offer in a limited area and will take our time to hone and improve our service,"" Ajay Kavan, vice president of AmazonFresh, said. AmazonFresh will initially offer a full grocery service at competitive prices in parts of central and east London from a distribution centre in the east of the capital. It said it would use small and medium sized external carriers for deliveries.Britain's grocery market has been convulsed in recent years by changing shopping habits, the rise of German discounters Aldi and Lidl and a brutal price war and analysts see AmazonFresh as a potential challenge to the whole industry over time. ""We will be very methodical and considered in how we roll this service out further in the UK,"" Kavan said.Shoppers in the eligible London postcodes who are already members of the Amazon Prime subscription service will be able to choose from a range of more than 130,000 products, including tens of thousands of grocery items. Amazon's offer will include fresh and frozen products from Morrisons, with whom it struck a wholesale supply deal in February. It will also offer major brands including Coca-Cola, Kellogg's, Danone, Warburtons and Walkers as well as products from local food producers and shops in locations such as London's trendy Borough Market.Amazon launched a fresh food offering in Seattle in 2007 and has since moved to a handful of other U.S. cities, but it has struggled to find the best pricing model.It has offered some food and drink items to British customers since 2010, and in November extended a packaged groceries offer already available in Germany and Japan to members of its premium Amazon Prime service in Britain.Amazon Prime members in the UK pay an annual subscription of 79 pounds. They can sign up for a 30-day trial of AmazonFresh and will then pay 6.99 pounds per month for the service, with unlimited deliveries for orders of above 40 pounds.

1185,"   By Julia Love | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Amazon.com Inc is preparing to launch a standalone music streaming subscription service, placing it squarely in competition with rival offerings from Apple Inc and Spotify, according to two people with knowledge of the matter.The service will be offered at $9.99 per month, in line with major rivals, and it will offer a competitive catalog of songs, the sources said. Amazon (AMZN.O) is finalizing licenses with labels for the service, which likely will be launched in late summer or early fall, the sources said.Amazon, which offers a free streaming music service with a limited catalog to subscribers of its Prime shipping and video service, did not respond to a request for comment about the new, full-fledged music plan.Although it will be a late entrant to the crowded streaming space, Amazon believes a comprehensive music service is important to its bid to be a one-stop shop for content and goods, the sources said.The new music offering also is intended to increase the appeal of the Amazon Echo, its home speaker, which searches the Internet and orders products from the retailer with voice commands. “A music service will further increase the daily interactions between Amazon and its customer base,” said former music executive Jay Samit when told about the company's plan.The new Amazon effort will compete directly with Apple Music and Spotify, which boast more than 30 million songs. Apple launched its service last year in one of the highest profile signs that listeners wanted subscription services, rather than paying for individual songs or albums. The service also will diversify Amazon's subscription offerings and be another step away from a single, annual subscription. Amazon recently began allowing subscribers to Prime to pay monthly, for instance. Silicon Valley titans such as Apple (AAPL.O) and Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google have muscled into music streaming in recent years, aiming to weave themselves more tightly into their customers’ daily routines and drive device sales. Amazon similarly hopes its new service’s tight integration with the Echo will help it stand out and reinforce the speaker’s appeal, the sources said.  Released broadly last year, the Echo has become a surprise hit that rival Google is now seeking to emulate with a speaker of its own.  The move suggests that Amazon will increasingly offer basic media options through Prime while selling additional subscriptions for consumers who want to go deeper. The company recently launched a standalone video service.The new music service is unlikely to steal many customers from Spotify, but it could pose a threat to other players, said David Pakman, a partner at Venrock who headed early Apple music efforts, when informed of the move.The Amazon service, which he called ""inevitable,"" “might take a little oxygen out of Apple’s potential pool of paying users,” he said.

1190,"   By David Shepardson | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The U.S. pay-TV industry proposed a plan to allow more than 50 million subscribers to ditch costly set-top boxes to get television and video programs to try and convince federal regulators to abandon more far-reaching reforms.Tom Wheeler, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, proposed in January opening the $20 billion cable and satellite TV set-top box market to new competitors and allow consumers to access multiple content providers from a single app or device.Under the industry proposal unveiled in meetings with the FCC this week, the pay-TV industry would commit to creating apps to allow consumers to watch programs without needing to lease a box and the FCC could implement regulations enforcing the commitment.Kim Hart, a spokeswoman for Wheeler, said on Friday that he was pleased the ""industry has adopted the primary goal of our proposal, to promote greater competition and choice for consumers, and agree it is achievable.""Wheeler wants to see additional details to ""determine whether their proposal fully meets all of the goals of our proceeding,"" Hart said. Wheeler's proposal has faced criticism from companies like AT&T Inc, Comcast Corp, Twenty-First Century Fox Inc, CBS Corp, Walt Disney Co, Viacom and others, along with more than 150 members of Congress. They have raised copyright, content licensing and other issues.Opponents fear rivals like Alphabet Inc or Apple Inc could create devices or apps and insert their own content or advertising in cable content. Wheeler's proposal would create a framework for device manufacturers and software developers to allow consumers to access content from providers such as Netflix, Amazon.com, Hulu, YouTube and a pay-TV company on a single device or app.FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democrat, praised Wheeler for proposing reforms, but told Reuters ""it has become clear the original proposal has real flaws. ... We need to find another way forward. So I’m glad that efforts are underway to hash out alternatives.""The FCC voted 3-2 along party lines in February to advance its plan. A final vote could come as early as August. Americans spend $20 billion a year to lease pay-TV boxes, or an average of $231 annually, the FCC says. Set-top box rental fees have jumped 185 percent since 1994, while the cost of TVs, computers and mobile phones have dropped by 90 percent.In April, President Barack Obama backed Wheeler's proposal, saying the cable industry is ""ripe for change.""

1199,"   By David Randall | NEW YORK  NEW YORK With Amazon and other e-commerce sites continuing to take market share from malls and other physical retailers, U.S. mutual fund managers are upping their bets on an overlooked part of the online shopping boom: warehouses.Real estate investment trusts (REITs) that own the distribution centers required to fill all those Amazon Prime boxes are a growing favorite on Wall Street after two years of underperformance compared with the broad real estate market. In large part, the move comes about because of changes in the supply chains of online retail giants like Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) over the last few years as they focus on fast, two-day shipping. Whereas a traditional retailer might send a pallet full of merchandise to a store, online shippers send out individual packages. That requires significantly more space to hold greater amounts of inventory on hand and to route all those boxes, said Eric Frankel, an analyst at research firm Green Street Advisors. That has allowed companies such as Prologis Inc (PLD.N) - which counts Amazon among its largest customers - to raise rents a record 20.1 percent in the first three months of the year. Even with the rent increases seen this year, warehouse occupancy rates are at their highest since 2000, making rent spikes across the industry likely for newer, modern warehouses near major cities, according to Green Street. ""We think the shift to e-commerce is just going to create more demand for warehouses and while those aren't the sexiest parts of the industry, that's where the demand is,"" said Nate Weisshaar, a portfolio manager at Motley Fool Asset Management. He has been adding to his position in Stag Industrial Inc (STAG.N), a warehouse company whose shares are up 24 percent year-to-date.  Total fund ownership of real estate companies such as Prologis Inc and Duke Realty Corp (DRE.N) has jumped by 30 percent or more over the last quarter, according to Morningstar data. At the same time, their share prices are up 15 percent or more for the year to date, well outpacing the 3-percent gain in the benchmark S&P 500, or the 9.9-percent increase in the Dow Jones All REIT index. ANOTHER CATALYST   The rally in warehouse stocks has sent the shares like Prologis to their highest levels since before the 2008 financial crisis. Some fund managers expect the rally to continue, in part because of a technical change by S&P that will recognize real estate as its own sector, rather than a part of financials. That will require active U.S. equity fund managers - who have traditionally been underweight real estate - to buy more than $100 billion in real estate shares to reach a market neutral position, according to J.P. Morgan. ""You're going to see more adoption of REITs overall, especially on the part of managers who haven't held the sector before, and they're going to gravitate to what they know,"" said Mike Underhill, portfolio manager at RidgeWorth Investments. Underhill estimates Prologis will be among the companies that see the largest inflows as a result of the change because of its connection to the more-familiar consumer discretionary sector. He is also bullish on mid-cap REITs such as DCT Industrial Trust Inc (DCT.N), which has been expanding its urban distribution centers in areas such as Atlanta and Washington DC in order to make it easier to fulfill next-day delivery orders.""These industrial REITs are caught up in the same paradigm shift that's been a negative for bricks and mortar retailers, but on the other side of it,"" he said.

1200,"  LIMA An oil spill in the Amazon region of Peru was detected on Friday night, state energy company Petroperu said in a statement on Saturday, adding that measures were being taken to fix the ruptured pipeline and to protect the environment.The company said it was investigating the cause of the spill, which took place in the Barranca district of Maranon province. Cleanup efforts were focused on preventing spilled oil from being absorbed into the ground, it said.The statement did not give an estimate of how much oil had escaped from the Nor Peruano pipeline in the accident. Previous spills had raised tensions between local residents and Petroperu. In March, an indigenous village in the Amazon area briefly held several public officials hostage to press for help after a ruptured pipeline leaked 1,000 barrels of crude. That spill followed a similar leak that released 2,000 barrels near other indigenous communities.

1201,"   By Chris Arsenault  RIO DE JANEIRO, June 29 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - S elective logging, road building and fires are threatening biodiversity in Brazil's Amazon despite a requirement that rural landowners maintain at least 80 percent of their forest cover in the world's largest rainforest, researchers said on Wednesday.In 2012, Brazil enacted a law to protect forests and help establish clearer rules for the ranchers, soy growers and other producers who pushed into the Amazon rainforest and other sensitive regions in recent decades.The new code carried over from previous legislation a requirement to maintain forest cover on 80 percent of rural properties in the Amazon, 35 percent in the central savanna region and 20 percent in other areas of the country.But an international team of researchers which assessed forest degradation in northern Brazil's Para region found that areas with the highest levels of protection under Brazil's forestry code, still lost between 46 percent and 61 percent of their conservation value. ""Many of the forests that remain standing are shadows of the pristine forests that once stood in their place,"" said Toby Gardner, a co-author of the study published in the journal Nature.""Brazil's efforts for reducing deforestation deserve praise, but the combined effects of these disturbances are under-cutting those efforts,"" the scientist from the Stockholm Environment Institute told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.The impacts of forest disturbance in Para have resulted in a loss of biodiversity equivalent to clearing more than 92,000 square kilometers of primary forests - an area larger than Austria, the study said. The impact of forest disturbance on the broader environment is greater than all of the deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon between 2006 and 2015, said researchers.The problem of disturbed forests hurting the broader environment is exacerbated by unclear land titles in the Amazon, Gardner said. Small-scale farmers who do not have formal land ownership are less likely to invest in forest protection measures such as fire breaks or sustainable management plans, he said.Forest destruction, which is largely caused by land-clearing for cattle and other farming, is a major source of carbon emissions that contribute to global warming.Annual forest clearing in the Amazon has declined by roughly 75 percent from its mid-2000s levels, although it has edged up in the past year.While deforestation rates in Brazil have dropped markedly over the past decade, smaller pieces of remaining forest give far fewer benefits for reducing climate change or protecting wildlife, the study said.

1202,"   By Emma Thomasson and Chijioke Ohuocha | BERLIN/LAGOS  BERLIN/LAGOS When German e-commerce investor Rocket Internet launched Jumia in 2012 as a would-be African Amazon, it was optimistic that a rapidly expanding middle class would quickly shift from street markets to shopping online.Four years on, falling sales for sites like Jumia and slower growth from Nigeria to Russia and Brazil is casting doubt on Rocket Internet's ambition to become the world's biggest Internet company outside the United States and China.Jumia made a loss of 17 million euros ($18.8 million) in the first three months of 2016 on sales that fell more than a third. The devaluation of Nigeria's naira last week is a new blow for Jumia, which now operates in more than 20 countries in Africa.    Revenue growth has also slowed at most of Rocket Internet's other 11 leading start-ups, ranging from furniture e-commerce and food delivery in Europe to online fashion in markets from India to Latin America and the Middle East.That is the consequence of Rocket's shift to rein in spending on marketing and logistics as it seeks to stem losses which it said peaked at 1 billion euros in 2015.As a result, shareholders have cast doubt on the valuation Rocket has put on its portfolio and questioned the strategy of sending business school graduates to set up 150 start-ups in more than 110 countries in just a few years.Exclusive interviews with shareholders reveal growing scepticism about Rocket's sprawling empire as emerging markets sour and technology stocks cool. Its share price has fallen 39 percent this year.""People have started to question whether the company portfolio is really as good as we first thought,"" said a top 20 shareholder, who declined to be named as they expect to trade stock. ""A lot of trust has been destroyed over the last 12 months.""Founded in Berlin in 2007 by brothers Oliver, Alexander and Marc Samwer, Rocket Internet aims to replicate the business models of Amazon, China's Alibaba and ride service Uber in new markets.With few other tech companies listed in Europe, investors jumped at the opportunity to gain exposure to an array of fast-growing businesses when Rocket went public in 2014, pushing the stock up by more than 50 percent in the first few months.However, the stock has been on a downward trajectory since peaking in February 2015 after it surprised investors with a new capital hike and shifted strategy to invest in the food delivery business in developed markets.The latest share price tumble started in April when Sweden's Kinnevik, Rocket's second-biggest shareholder after the Samwer brothers, slashed the valuation for its emerging market fashion websites by two thirds.That unsettled investors, especially after Kinnevik said its representatives were stepping down from the board, citing potential conflicts of interest over future investments. Kinnevik, which has hedged its bets on Rocket in Africa by investing in Jumia's main rival Konga, declined to comment for this article. It has said it will work closely with Rocket although it could review its stake in two or three years. Martin Weber, a partner at venture capital firm Holtzbrinck, which has a 1.9 percent Rocket stake, says the company has struggled to provide enough information about its holdings.""The stock market loves transparency. And that is not practically possible at Rocket,"" Weber told Reuters. ""Rocket needs to prove that it can get profitable companies on their feet.""Samwer has admitted Rocket had initially done too little to communicate with investors after the firm went public, but he is not worried about the share price.""We planted a lot of seeds and I believe in the next 24 months a lot of investors will see it the same way,"" he told a Berlin tech conference this month.He says the sale in April of Lazada - Rocket's loss-making Amazon clone in Southeast Asia - for $1 billion to Alibaba underlines the logic of going into frontier markets before more established rivals.Some investors are prepared to give him more time.""We believe that the portfolio is worth a lot more,"" said Ralph Dommermuth, chief executive of United Internet, Rocket's third-biggest shareholder, even after he took a 157 million euro writedown on his firm's Rocket stake in May. ""Among European investors in young Internet firms, Rocket Internet is the broadest and has the most experience in the sector.""CEO'S PROMISE Rocket now has a market capitalization of 3 billion euros, well below the 5.3 billion valuation it put on its portfolio at April 30, and only just above the 2.8 billion in cash held by Rocket and its operating companies as of March 31.Most Internet start-ups burn cash in early years as they pour money into marketing, logistics and technology to pursue revenue growth above all else, hoping to move into the black  once they reach scale.That approach has worked for the likes of Amazon, Alibaba and European online fashion site Zalando. Neil Campling, head of technology research at Northern Trust Capital Markets, who rates the stock a ""sell"", doubts the Rocket businesses can replicate Amazon's success because their markets are so underdeveloped and the cost of logistics so much higher. ""As soon as they reduce marketing, you see revenue growth decline substantially,"" he said. ""They haven't got the scale.""However, Samwer says Rocket has more than enough capital to fund its main start-ups until they turn profitable.Samwer promised last September to make three start-ups profitable by the end of 2017, with Middle East fashion site Namshi, online home furnishings store Westwing and food takeout firm Delivery Hero seen as the most promising.Jumia, which predicted in late 2013 it could turn a profit within 18 months, is far from that goal. It lost 111 million euros in 2015 on sales of 135 million.But Jumia Nigeria CEO Juliet Anammah believes the company can make a profit within three to five years. ""Africa is a long-term play,"" she said.Samwer has now changed tack for his Amazon clones, shifting from buying and shipping their own stock - more suited to countries with well-established logistics - to providing a commission-based marketplace for third-party retailers, like Alibaba.""You are tapping into the supply capacity that exists in the country. So you are not dependant exclusively on your working capital to source and bring in retail products,"" Anammah said.Samwer remains optimistic for Jumia.""The people are still there even if emerging markets are cold... They still have some money,"" he said. ""The offline to online shift continues.""(Refiles to amend attribution in paragraph 25.)

1205,"   By Jonathan Stempel | NEW YORK  NEW YORK A federal appeals court on Thursday threw out a $7.25 billion antitrust settlement reached by Visa Inc (V.N) and MasterCard Inc (MA.N) with millions of retailers that accused the card networks of improperly fixing credit and debit card fees.The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York said the accord was unfair to retailers that stood to receive no payments and, in the court's view, little or no benefit at all. It also decertified the case as a class action.""This is not a settlement; it is a confiscation,"" wrote Circuit Judge Pierre Leval, a member of the three-judge panel that unanimously struck down the settlement.The deal had been the largest all-cash U.S. antitrust settlement, though its value shrank to about $5.7 billion after roughly 8,000 retailers ""opted out.""Thursday's decision is a blow to the credit card industry, which hoped the settlement would end a decade of litigation brought on behalf of about 12 million retailers against Visa, MasterCard and banks that issue their cards.It was intended to resolve claims that merchants were overcharged on interchange fees, or swipe fees, when shoppers used credit or debit cards, and were barred from directing customers toward cheaper means of payment.The settlement may now need to be renegotiated, or the case could go to trial.""Swipe fees are an improper and unnecessary hidden tax on consumers,"" said Jeffrey Shinder, a Constantine Cannon partner representing Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O), Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) and other opponents of the accord.

Both declined to comment.The settlement had called for retailers that accepted Visa or MasterCard from January 2004 to November 2012 to share in as much as $7.25 billion, with the ability to opt out.Retailers that accepted the cards from then on, meanwhile, were to get injunctive relief in the form of rule changes, expiring in July 2021, and could not opt out.Writing for the appeals court, Circuit Judge Dennis Jacobs said these groups' divergent interests meant they should not have been represented by the same law firms, which were awarded $544.8 million of fees.While making clear he did not question the firms' motives, Jacobs said the conflict ""sapped"" their incentive to zealously represent the retailers obtaining injunctive relief, and led to terms that benefited other retailers at their expense.The case will return to the Brooklyn federal court, where it will be overseen by U.S. District Judge Margo Brodie.The case is In Re: Payment Card Interchange Fee and MerchantDiscount Antitrust Litigation, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 12-4671.

1210,"   By David Randall | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Fund managers on the hunt for dividends find themselves wading into the shares of consumer companies that typically attract investors looking for growth instead. One big reason for the move: traditional yield-heavy sectors like utilities and telecoms are trading at some of their highest valuations on record relative to the broad market. Fund managers see more to gain by buying companies that may offer capital gains alongside growing dividends at a time of low unemployment and an improving housing market. Also, some consumer stocks look relatively cheap at a time when Amazon.com Inc and fast online shopping have been threatening to upend the retail sector.""We've been nibbling at very high quality discretionary companies that are now cheaper because of 'Brexit' and worries about Amazon,"" said Ramona Persaud, a co-portfolio manager of the $7.8 billion Fidelity Equity-Income fund.  Companies that look poised to grow their dividends thanks to improving free cash flows are one standard deviation cheaper than traditional income-oriented companies measured by either price to earnings or price to book, she added.Overall, income-oriented funds have 10.1 percent of their portfolios invested in consumer discretionary companies, up from 8.1 percent three years ago, according to fund-tracker Morningstar. Cruise line operator Carnival Corp and big box retailers Home Depot Inc and Best Buy Co Inc are among those seeing new interest from income-oriented managers.  Each company offers a yield of 3.6 percent or less, on par with the 3.8 percent yield of utility-giant Duke Energy Corp. At the same time, Duke trades at a trailing price to earnings ratio of 21.6, compared with a 15.1 P/E of Carnival, which increased its dividend by 17 percent in April. The broad S&P 500 trades at a trailing P/E of 19.6, according to Thomson Reuters data.Scott Moore, a portfolio manager of the $37 million Buffalo Dividend Focus fund, said his fund holds Home Depot in large part as a play on the housing market that will not be hurt by online shopping.  ""This is a company in the discretionary space that's not going to be disrupted by Amazon,"" Moore said.

Amazon expects its second annual Prime Day event on July 12, to be bigger than last year.

Wal-Mart's free shipping offer will be in addition to the recently launched 30-day free trial of ShippingPass, its unlimited 2-day shipping program, which costs $49 per year. Wal-Mart said customer sign-ups for ShippingPass have more than quadrupled since the offer launch last week.

1217,"   By David Randall | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Amazon's long shadow is falling on retailers previously thought immune to the threat of e-commerce, forcing U.S. fund managers to rethink their approach to consumer stocks by focusing on companies whose businesses cannot be upended by the online giant.At the core of the problem: Amazon.com Inc, once thought of as a place to buy books and household goods, is on track to become the largest apparel retailer in the United States by 2017, according to estimates from Cowen and Co, displacing department store operator Macy's Inc. Amazon's push into higher-end clothing over the last three years only adds to its dominance in e-commerce overall, with a nearly 40 percent market share, one that is larger than the next 21 retailers combined - a group that includes Wal-Mart Stores Inc and Best Buy Co Inc, according to research firm Slice Intelligence. Amazon shares hit a record high on Monday, day ahead of its Prime Day sales event. By market value, the company surpassed Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

Overall, actively managed large-cap funds now hold more restaurant, home improvement, and leisure stocks - all sectors in which Amazon does not yet compete -  than at any other time in the last five years, according to Morningstar data, while they have steadily cut holdings of apparel and department stores over the same period. The number of large-cap funds that own shares of Amazon, meanwhile, has risen 15 percent over the last three years.  Susan Bao, a co-portfolio manager of the $9.9 billion JP Morgan Large-Cap Core fund, said she no longer holds traditional retailers such as Macy's or Target Corp, and does not expect to do so again. Instead, she is focusing on companies such as cruise-ship operator Carnival Corp, which should benefit from an improving jobs market. ""This is one of companies that's going to do better when the consumer is in better shape that's also Amazon-proof,"" she said. Shares of Carnival are down 13.8 percent year to date, in part because of fears of the Zika virus, while Amazon's stock is up 10.8 percent over the same time.

1220,"  LONDON Britain looks set for an economic slowdown and possibly a recession after voters decided to leave the European Union in a referendum on June 23.Official data showing how the decision is affecting the economy will not be published until mid-August but there have already been some early signs of the impact.Below is a summary of some signals of the Brexit effect on Britain's economy.RETAILERS SPORTS DIRECT (SPD.L):The retailer said political uncertainty was likely to drag on consumer confidence. The firm looks set to take a hit when making stock purchases because it was not hedged against the sharp fall in the value of sterling against the dollar for this financial year or beyond.MARKS & SPENCER (MKS.L):M&S said consumer confidence weakened before the vote. It reported weaker-than-expected sales in the three months to July 2 but said it was too early to quantify the Brexit effect. It kept its guidance for the 2016-17 financial year.  JOHN LEWIS [JLPLC.UL]   The high-end retailer said sales growth at its department store chain slowed in the week to July 2.AMAZON (AMZN.O) Amazon said it has not seen a sales dip in Britain since the referendum and its plans for the UK had not changed. It announced 1,000 new jobs.SAINSBURY'S (SBRY.L). Britain's second-biggest supermarket warned that talk of a recession could prove self-fulfilling.FINANCIAL FIRMS Major investment banks including Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and JPMorgan (JPM.N) said they would work to help London remain a top center for international finance, and a big source of tax revenue for the government.Banks and other financial firms employ more than 2 million people across Britain.But JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said the bank could move thousands of staff out of Britain if the country lost its automatic right to sell financial services to the EU.Recruiting company SThree Plc (STHR.L) said hiring  managers, especially in the banking sector, put decisions on hold in the run-up to the EU referendum.PROPERTY DEVELOPERS AND HOUSEBUILDERS  Several major investment firms have temporarily prevented investors taking money out of commercial real estate funds while others have slashed the value of the funds.The Bank of England said the slump in transactions in the commercial real estate sector could tighten credit conditions for UK businesses because many companies use their real estate as collateral for loans.PERSIMMON (PSN.L) The housebuilder said the market had steadied after some deal cancellations immediately after the referendum.ECONOMY  CONFIDENCE  The business outlook darkened by the most in four years, according to a survey published on July 11 when there were also fresh signs of a fall in consumer spending and a slowing of economic activity in London.Another survey, published on July 8, showed consumer morale suffered its biggest drop in more than five years after the referendum, echoing other signs of a hit to confidence since the vote.A separate YouGov/CEBR measure of confidence among businesses also showed a sharp fall.Barclaycard, which processes nearly half of Britain's credit and debt card transactions, said spending grew by 2.1 percent in the week after the referendum, although discretionary spending in pubs and restaurants fell.CAR REGISTRATIONS New car registrations fell in June for only the second time in more than four years, and the number of shoppers on the country's high streets dropped 3.4 percent in the days following the shock vote to leave the EU.RETAIL SALES The number of people visiting British shops fell 3.4 percent in the 10 days following the referendum, according to retail data company Springboard. It said the initial shock of the Brexit vote had put people off shopping.Accountants BDO said retail sales spiraled lower through June in the run-up to the vote.JOBS MARKET Recruiter PageGroup (PAGE.L) said its second-quarter UK gross profit in constant currency fell by 2.3 percent in the three months to June 30 as firms held off filling jobs in the run up to the referendum. A survey from the Recruitment and Employment Confederation showed the number of permanent staff hired via recruitment firms in June fell for the first time since December 2012 - around the last time Britain's economy flirted with recession. The survey was conducted between June 13 and 24.

1222,"  LONDON Sainsbury's, Britain's second largest supermarket group, is trialing a one hour home delivery service that is similar in concept to Amazon's 'Prime Now', it said on Friday.Online shopping is one of the better-performing parts of Britain's retail sector and has become a key battleground for the big supermarkets as they grapple with the growth of German discounters Aldi [ALDIEI.UL] and Lidl [LIDUK.UL].Britain's online food market is expected to nearly double to 17.2 billion pounds ($23 billion) in the five years to 2020, according to industry research group IGD.Sainsbury's is trialing its new service, called 'Chop Chop', in the Wandsworth area of south London, which will have a delivery fee of 4.99 pounds.Customers living within three kilometers of its Wandsworth store can order up to 20 Sainsbury's products for delivery to their home within an hour, using an app on Apple devices.Sainsbury's Chief Executive Mike Coupe told analysts at Bernstein, in a call with the brokerage on Thursday, that the company can see potential demand for the provision of a basket of food on a very short time scale. He noted that Sainsbury's has the nationwide store network, with large fresh food ranges in all of them, and the online retail knowledge, to provide such a service if the market develops.Amazon launched Prime Now in London a year ago and it is now available to more than 30 percent of the UK population.The mobile app is available to Prime members and offers one-hour delivery on more than 15,000 items for 6.99 pounds, or delivery at no extra charge within a choice of two-hour, same-day delivery slots. Items available include essentials such as fresh milk, nappies, coffee and chocolate, as well as games consoles, toys, gifts and sports equipment.Last month Amazon also launched a British version of its U.S. AmazonFresh food delivery service, stepping up the pressure on the traditional big supermarkets. Coupe also told the Bernstein analysts that he sees no reason for rival Asda, under new CEO Sean Clarke, ""to go hard on price"", seeing his most likely action as moves to improve store standards, service and availability. Speculation of a racheting-up of an industry price war has been rife since Wal-Mart, Asda's American owner, said last month it would shift the balance of Asda's strategy from protecting profits to protecting market share.

1225,"  Liberty Media Corp Chief Executive Greg Maffei made an offer to buy internet radio company Pandora Media Inc in recent months, valuing the company at more than $3.4 billion, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday.Pandora's board rebuffed the advance, because it believed the company's true value was closer to what it was in the fall, when the shares were trading around $20, the Journal said, citing people familiar with the matter. The $15 per share offer from Maffei was several dollars above where the shares were trading at the time, the Journal said.

1238,"  MUMBAI India's biggest e-commerce firm Flipkart is buying domestic online fashion retailer Jabong from Global Fashion Group for $70 million in cash, the latest consolidation move in the country's e-commerce sector as competition intensifies.Flipkart unit Myntra, India's largest online fashion retailer which is buying Jabong, said on Tuesday the two sites will have a combined base of 15 million monthly active users. Global Fashion Group is backed by Germany's Rocket Internet (RKET.DE) and Sweden's Kinnevik (KINVb.ST).Niche e-commerce players in India are facing greater competition from both domestic rivals and the likes of Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), at a time when industry valuations have begun to cool.Rocket Internet had flagged earlier this year that business was tough in India, warranting more investment by Global Fashion Group. The deal puts Myntra, which itself was bought by Flipkart for about $300 million last year, in a stronger position to take on Flipkart's biggest local rival Snapdeal and Amazon, which has pledged to invest over $5 billion in India to boost market share in the country.Amazon's huge bet and tough competition have already prompted some small local players to consolidate. Privately held Indian conglomerate Future Group, which owns a string of fashion and retail assets, earlier in 2016 bought online furniture retailer FabFurnish.com.   The e-commerce fashion retail space in India has especially been attracting investment from not only established names such as Flipkart, Snapdeal and Amazon, but also from newer entrants like Reliance Industries (RELI.NS) - India's largest company, which outlined plans to roll out an e-commerce website in April.India's e-commerce market is seen as having potential though, with annual sales of $36.7 billion expected by 2020, consultants KPMG said in report in November. The Myntra and Jabong sites will exclusively offer international brands such as Top Shop, Dorothy Perkins, Forever 21, and Swarovski in India, Myntra said.

1242,"   By Herbert Lash | NEW YORK  NEW YORK U.S. stocks mostly rose on Thursday in anticipation of results from tech heavyweights Alphabet and Amazon, while the yen eased after Reuters reported the Bank of Japan was considering expanding monetary stimulus to address signs of weak inflation.Expectations of further stimulus in Japan have dominated currency trading in recent weeks and overshadowed the U.S. central bank's policy-setting statement on Wednesday, when the Federal Reserve indicated it was in no rush to raise interest rates.On Wall Street, stocks initially were dragged lower by Ford Motor (F.N), which posted poor second-quarter profit, as the U.S. market was range-bound for a second week.Amazon.com shares (AMZN.O) rose 2.2 percent in anticipation of its quarterly results after the bell, and added about 2 percent following the close. Google parent company Alphabet (GOOGL.O) also reported results after the bell, with shares gaining more than 4 percent in extended trade.""Tech has been pretty much the strongest sector over the last month. Momentum players are focusing to buy on pullbacks,"" said Michael Matousek, head trader at U.S. Global Investors in San Antonio, Texas. ""With Amazon, if it's a good beat we will be off to the races because it's already pushing up to 52-week highs.""Equity markets earlier in Europe retreated after Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) reported a more than 70 percent fall in quarterly profit that was well below analysts' estimates. Investors are concerned by a slowdown in growth overseas, which will crimp many American companies even as the U.S. economy expands, as about 40 percent of their revenue is generated abroad, said James Swanson, chief investment strategist at MFS Investment Management in Boston. ""These global companies do not have much power to raise prices, but we know labor costs around the world are rising. That's the squeeze that I'm worried about,"" Swanson said.Ford (F.N) reported weaker-than-expected profit and declared the U.S. auto industry's long recovery was at an end, sending its stock and shares of other auto companies into a tailspin. Ford's stock fell 9.65 percent to $12.51.But Facebook (FB.O) opened at an all-time high of $128.31 after quarterly results handily beat analysts' estimates on Wednesday. Shares were up 1.3 percent.    MSCI's all-country stock index .MIWD00000PUS rebounded, up 0.08 percent. The pan-regional FTSEurofirst 300 .FTEU3 index in Europe closed down 1.0 percent to 1,338.28.The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI closed down 15.82 points, or 0.09 percent, to 18,456.35. The S&P 500 .SPX rose 3.48 points, or 0.16 percent, to 2,170.06 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 15.17 points, or 0.3 percent, to 5,154.98. In Japan, the Ministry of Finance has been lobbying hard for the BOJ to ease policy further and has prepared a statement it will publish in case the central bank eases, sources told Reuters.The yen weakened to U.S. session lows of 105.50 on the report. It had gained earlier on Thursday on expectations that the BOJ could disappoint investors.The dollar index .DXY, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, fell 0.37 percent to 96.692. The euro EUR= rose 0.22 percent to $1.1079.Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes US10YT=RR gained 3/32 in price, pushing yields down to 1.5044 percent. In Europe, investors bought more than 8 billion euros of new debt from Italy, a day before Rome faces a health check of its banks. The extra yield investors demand to hold Italy's debt hit its highest since February 2015 this week at 14 basis points.German 10-year yields held close to Wednesday's closing levels, showing little impact from the Fed's decision to keep rates on hold.Oil prices fell nearly 2 percent, hitting three-month lows, after a fresh stock build at the Cushing, Oklahoma delivery hub for U.S. futures added to concerns that producers were pumping more crude than needed.Brent crude LCOc1 settled down 77 cents at $42.70 a barrel. U.S. light crude CLc1 declined 78 cents to settle at $41.14.

1244,"   By Jonathan Stempel  Jeff Bezos, the founder and chief executive of Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), has become the world's third-richest person as of the market close for the first time, Forbes magazine said, passing Warren Buffett, the chairman and chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N).Bezos' fortune was $65.3 billion as of 4:30 p.m. EDT (2030 GMT) on Thursday, compared with Buffett's $64.9 billion.Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) co-founder Bill Gates remained the world's richest person, at $77.7 billion, while Spain's Amancio Ortega, who founded the Zara clothing chain's owner Inditex SA (ITX.MC), was second at $72.7 billion. Facebook Inc (FB.O) co-founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg was fifth, at $54 billion. Bezos, 52, owns close to 18 percent of Amazon. Its stock has risen by roughly 50 percent since early February, as the world's largest online retailer continued to upend retailing as more people took to the Web rather than the mall to shop.Amazon's share price rose further in after-hours trading, after the Seattle-based company reported better-than-expected second-quarter results. Buffett, 85, owns close to 18 percent of Berkshire, but his donation this month of $2.86 billion of Berkshire stock to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and four family charities led to his drop to fourth place. He has donated more than $24.3 billion to the Gates Foundation and family charities since 2006.Berkshire is based in Omaha, Nebraska, and has roughly 90 business units including Geico car insurance, the BNSF railroad and Dairy Queen ice cream. In June, Buffett called Bezos a ""classic example"" of how a business owner could thrive, by having focused at Amazon on how to ""delight"" customers, and keep them coming back, rather than simply process their orders.

1245,"   By Noel Randewich  Wall Street edged higher on Thursday as investors looked beyond disappointing earnings from Ford and bought shares in Apple, while Alphabet surged after the bell following its quarterly report.It was the 10th session of range-bound trading, following a sharp rally in late June and early July that hit record highs and has left the S&P 500 up 6 percent for the year.In extended trade, Alphabet jumped 4 percent after the Google parent-company reported stronger-than-expected revenue. Amazon.com (AMZN.O) rose 1.7 percent after its quarterly report. ""Tech has been pretty much the strongest sector over the last month.

Amazon rose 1.8 percent, pushing up its market capitalization by about $6 billion to around $361 billion.Together, the five companies would add about $346 billion to their combined value - roughly the gross domestic product of Egypt - if they were to trade at analysts' median price targets.Alphabet - which competes with all of the other four companies in either advertising, cloud computing, or operating systems - showed that efforts to push its vast ad business toward mobile were paying off, calming fears that the company's best days were behind it.""How many other almost $100 billion revenue companies are accelerating growth rates to their strongest level in years?,""  Macquarie analyst Ben Schachter said in a research note.Ad revenue from its Google business, which accounts for 89 percent of total revenue, jumped 19.5 percent to $19.14 billion. Google also houses the company's Android business that competes with iOS from Apple, which sold more iPhones than analysts expected in the latest quarter.Alphabet's ad sales numbers, and the stellar ad revenue growth that Facebook reported on Wednesday, underscored the shift in ad dollars to mobile devices from television.The leading social media company's wildly popular mobile app and push into video attracted new advertisers and encouraged existing ones to spend more.SMOKIN'  While Google still controls nearly a third of the roughly $187 billion global digital-ad market, Facebook's share has risen to 12 percent so far this year, from 8.6 percent in 2014, according to market research firm eMarketer.Alphabet's other businesses, including cloud, through which it competes with Microsoft and Amazon, also held their own.""Alphabet smoked Q2 expectations, including revenue upside and a further exhibition of its new passion for expense control,"" Pacific Crest analyst Evan Wilson said in a note.Wilson, who has an ""overweight"" rating on the company's stock, raised his price target to $960 from $910.Of 50 analysts covering the company, 19 raised their price targets on Alphabet's class A stock, which has a median price target of $907.Goldman Sachs was the most bullish, raising its target by $120 to $930.

1250,"   By Jonathan Stempel  Jeff Bezos, the founder and chief executive of Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), has become the world's third-richest person as of the market close for the first time, Forbes magazine said, passing Warren Buffett, the chairman and chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N).Bezos' fortune was $65.3 billion as of 4:30 p.m. EDT (2030 GMT) on Thursday, compared with Buffett's $64.9 billion.Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) co-founder Bill Gates remained the world's richest person, at $77.7 billion, while Spain's Amancio Ortega, who founded the Zara clothing chain's owner Inditex SA (ITX.MC), was second at $72.7 billion. Facebook Inc (FB.O) co-founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg was fifth, at $54 billion. Bezos, 52, owns close to 18 percent of Amazon. Its stock has risen by roughly 50 percent since early February, as the world's largest online retailer continued to upend retailing as more people took to the Web rather than the mall to shop.Amazon's share price rose further in after-hours trading, after the Seattle-based company reported better-than-expected second-quarter results. Buffett, 85, owns close to 18 percent of Berkshire, but his donation this month of $2.86 billion of Berkshire stock to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and four family charities led to his drop to fourth place. He has donated more than $24.3 billion to the Gates Foundation and family charities since 2006.Berkshire is based in Omaha, Nebraska, and has roughly 90 business units including Geico car insurance, the BNSF railroad and Dairy Queen ice cream. In June, Buffett called Bezos a ""classic example"" of how a business owner could thrive, by having focused at Amazon on how to ""delight"" customers, and keep them coming back, rather than simply process their orders.

1252,"  Wal-Mart Stores Inc is in talks to buy Jet.com, a year-old online rival, as part of a multibillion-dollar revamp of its e-commerce division aimed at boosting online sales growth, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday.Jet.com could be worth as much as $3 billion, the Journal said, citing people familiar with the matter. Wal-Mart spokesman Greg Hitt declined to comment and Jet could not be immediately reached for comment.The world's largest retailer is playing catch up with Amazon.com Inc on distribution and technology. The acquisition could give it access to Jet.com's innovative pricing software, its network of warehouses and customer data.For the past five years Wal-Mart has been on an acquisition spree, buying 15 startups in an attempt to bring in the talent and technology needed to drive e-commerce growth. That includes a social data analysis startup that became its core Silicon Valley technology arm, @WalmartLabs.While Wal-Mart has not said what it spent on those acquisitions, it has disclosed a total of $3.1 billion for e-commerce and digital projects, such as its platform and new warehouses, in the four fiscal years to January 2017. Wal-Mart acquired a majority stake in Chinese e-commerce firm Yihaodian in 2012 but sold it in June to JD.com Inc, which is China's second-largest e-commerce company.Despite its investments, Wal-Mart has not projected when its online business might turn a profit and its goal of growing by 20 to 30 percent a year may be tough to achieve.Wal-Mart's online business has struggled and posted its slowest growth in a year in the latest quarter. Its online sales were $13.7 billion in 2015, according to research firm Internet Retailer. Wal-Mart said recently that all the changes brought on by the e-commerce reboot, including installing a new technology platform and building new warehouses, contributed to its recent slowdown in growth.A July 2015 survey by consulting firm Kantar Retail showed the extent to which Amazon had eaten into Wal-Mart's customer base. The survey found that 48 percent of shoppers at Wal-Mart Supercenters were placing orders weekly or monthly on Amazon.com, double the percentage shopping at that frequency on Wal-Mart's own site. Acquiring Jet could help Wal-Mart in establishing a bigger presence online, analysts said. The startup was launched in July 2015 and has raised more than $500 million in capital from venture capital firms.    Jet's initial strategy was to offer large up-front discounts and the lowest prices on items based on a unique pricing formula that took into account factors like basket size, for an annual $50 fee. But three months after launch, Jet changed strategy and eliminated its subscription model.Wal-Mart shares closed 0.3 percent lower at $72.94 on the New York Stock Exchange.

1253,"   By Thomas Wilson | TOKYO  TOKYO Japan's Fair Trade Commission has raided the offices of Amazon.com Inc's (AMZN.O) local unit on suspicion of pressuring retailers to offer products at lower prices than on rival sites, the Nikkei business daily said on Monday.The paper, which cited unidentified sources with knowledge of the case, did not say when the raid took place.A Japan Fair Trade Commission spokesman said he could not confirm the report but added: ""I won't say the contents are incorrect.""An Amazon Japan spokeswoman declined to comment.Amazon Japan's website booked net sales of $8.3 billion last year, equivalent to 7.7 percent of Amazon.com's worldwide net sales. By comparison, main rival Rakuten Inc (4755.T) recorded e-commerce revenue in Japan of 263.9 billion yen ($2.9 billion) in the same period. Amazon's practices toward retailers and e-commerce partners have also come under scrutiny in Europe.Germany's Federal Cartel Office began an investigation in November into Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Amazon after complaints that publishers were being forced to accept ""unreasonable conditions"" for the marketing of audiobooks.       And the European Union last year opened an antitrust investigation into Amazon's e-book business, examining whether clauses in contracts prevented publishers from offering more favorable deals to Amazon's competitors.Apple and Audible, Amazon's audiobook business, declined at the time to comment on the German investigation.On the E.U. probe, Amazon said it was confident its agreements with publishers were legal and in the best interests of readers.  Britain's Office of Fair Trading and Germany's Federal Cartel Office probed Amazon's conditions for third-party sellers trading on its ""Marketplace"" platform between 2012 and 2013.Both bodies closed their investigations after the company altered policies that banned traders from selling products offered on Amazon more cheaply elsewhere.

1254,"   By Paul Carsten | BEIJING  BEIJING JD.com Inc, China's second biggest e-commerce company, reported revenue for the second quarter of 2016 that was within company forecasts, even as the growth rate continued a steady decline that is expected to continue.    The company, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd's main rival in online shopping, said on Wednesday revenue for the quarter rose 42 percent to 65.2 billion yuan ($9.83 billion), within JD.com's forecast range of 64.2-66.2 billion yuan.But the company is predicting an even sharper decline in growth for the third quarter, compounding concerns that China's e-commerce sector is saturating. JD.com's revenue from Amazon-like online direct sales rose 40 percent in the quarter, versus a 67 percent jump in sales from services and other businesses.JD.com now expects revenues for the third quarter to be 59-61 billion yuan, a rise of 34-38 percent from the same quarter in 2015.     Net losses were 132.1 million yuan ($19.92 million), compared to a loss of 510.4 million yuan in the previous year.    The total value of merchandise transactions on JD.com's platforms was 108.7 billion yuan in the quarter, up 47 percent excluding online marketplace Paipai.com, which JD.com shut down.Including Paipai's previous contribution to transactions for the previous year in the comparison, the second quarter's growth rate for value of merchandise sold would be 40 percent, according to Reuters calculations. The company also gave an update on its share repurchase program it authorized in September, saying it had purchased 2.4 million ADSs for about $51.5 million. It has also entered into a structured repurchase agreement to lower the cost of acquiring shares.

1256,"  * Brexit doesn't change strategy to expand in UK* Sales growth slows in core markets but profits jump* Outlook raised last month after strong preliminary figures* Shares up 2.2 pct to seven-month high   (Adds comments from conference call)By Emma ThomassonLONDON, Aug 11 Zalando, Europe's biggest pure online fashion retailer, sees opportunities to grow in Britain despite the country's vote to leave the European Union as it encroaches on the territory of rivals like ASOS .Founded in Berlin in 2008, Zalando makes more than half its sales in its core markets of Germany, Austria and Switzerland. It launched in Britain in 2011, but has so far not made the same big marketing drive there that has helped sales soar elsewhere. Managing board member Rubin Ritter said Britain's vote in June to leave the EU had not changed Zalando's strategy in the country and he sees opportunities to grow faster there, especially now that the German company has added more UK-based brands.""We still see the UK as a very attractive potential market,""Ritter told journalists during a conference call. ""British customers continue to buy fashion.""Ritter said last month the fall in the pound since the Brexit vote dented the value of sales there, although Britain accounts for a ""very small"" portion of the group's total. Ritter made the comments after Zalando reported second-quarter adjusted earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) almost tripled to 80.9 million euros ($90.3 million) on revenue up 25 percent to 916 million euros. That compared to analyst consensus for 78 million and 918 million respectively.Revenue growth slowed in Germany, Austria and Switzerland to 14.7 percent from 32.5 percent a year ago, but the adjusted EBIT margin for the region quadrupled to 13.9 percent, while it was a steady 4.1 percent for the rest of its business.The main driver of the jump in profitability was increased efficiency in marketing spending and in fulfilment operations due to higher utilisation of its warehouses, Ritter said. SHARES RECOVER Zalando's shares had come under pressure this year as investors expressed fears it is more exposed to Amazon's  foray into fashion than ASOS which has a more targeted clientele, but they jumped last month after strong preliminary figures.The stock was up another 2.3 percent at 0735 GMT to a seven-month high, outperforming a flat European retail index  and a 0.4 percent rise for ASOS.Zalando had also raised its guidance for the full year adjusted EBIT margin to 4.0-5.5 percent from 3.0 to 4.5 percent and reiterated a forecast for full-year sales to grow at the upper end of a 20 to 25 percent range.ASOS and smaller British online fashion retailer Boohoo.com Plc have both raised their full-year sales growth forecasts due to robust demand through the summer and spring.

EBITA grew 3 percent in the quarter to 351 million euros, driven by French broadcaster M6 and RTL Germany. Both sales of 1.45 billion euros and EBITA missed analysts' forecasts in a Reuters poll.""You can't look at the production business on a quarterly basis simply because of the nature of the business,"" co-Chief Executive Guillaume de Posch said in an interview with Reuters, pointing out the uneven occurrence of large contracts.He added the financial impact of a deal announced with Amazon to show Fremantle drama ""American Gods"" on Amazon Prime - part of a burgeoning business with so-called over-the-top Internet players - would first be felt in 2017. Analysts welcomed the raised guidance and dividend but expressed some concern over the second quarter.Shares in RTL were down 1.6 percent at 78.13 euros by 0913 GMT, and were the weakest performers in the European media index , which was down 0.7 percent.""The overall operative development is showing only a slightly positive dynamic against the backdrop of a solid business cycle in major markets,"" wrote DZ Bank analyst Harald Heider, who rates RTL ""hold"". German rival ProSiebenSat.1 reported a 15 percent jump in second-quarter revenues and a 7 percent increase in recurring core profit on the back of a positive economy in its German-speaking markets.The VPRT association of German private broadcasters forecasts net advertising revenue in the television sector will rise by 2 to 3 percent in Germany during 2016.RTL's Chief Financial Officer Elmar Heggen said the company had ample scope for acquisitions even after paying the interim dividend of 1 euro per share in September.It spent a total of 48 million euros in the first half on acquisitions and stepping up its stakes in existing investments, and has an annual budget of around 250 million euros.($1 = 0.8872 euros)   (Reporting by Georgina Prodhan; Editing by Maria Sheahan and Mark Potter)",2016-08-25,AMZN,"Thu Aug 25, 2016 | 5:50am EDT",UPDATE 2-RTL revenues slide as FremantleMedia disappoints,http://www.reuters.com//article/rtl-group-results-idUSL8N1B613K?type=companyNews

1273,"   By Chris Arsenault  RIO DE JANEIRO (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - In Brazil's Amazon where no-one knows who exactly owns a swathe of territory the size of Ukraine, a lack of formal property deeds is causing conflict, greater deforestation and environmental damage, researchers said on Tuesday.An area of 60 million hectares in Brazil's Amazonas state, 40 percent of the state's total area, is classified as vacant public land and lacks formal title deeds, the Climate Policy Initiative (CPI) said.Without clear titles proving land ownership, farmers have less incentive to make new investments, improve productivity or protect the environment, said the CPI, a San Francisco-based group with operations in Rio de Janeiro.    ""There are consequences for the climate, the environment and the economy due to this lack of land tenure,"" CPI project manager Rita Damasceno told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. ""People are actually dying because of this issue.""A lack of property rights have led to more than 15,000 land-related conflicts over the past 20 years in Brazil, leading to more than 700 deaths, the report said.  In 2014 alone, nearly 100,000 families were affected by land conflicts covering an area of more than eight million hectares.When it comes to securing land rights, Brazil ranked 64 out of 128 nations on the 2016 International Property Rights Index.The lack of a central, integrated database of who owns different pieces of land in Latin America's largest country is part of the reason for Brazil's poor score, the CPI said.   It also said that 11 federal government bodies were responsible for administering different aspects of land property rights leading to an inefficient system. The lack of secure property rights was most acute in the Amazon and other rural areas, the report said. In the Brazilian states of Para and Piaui fewer than half of rural properties are formally registered with the government, deterring farmers from ploughing money into their land and curbing efforts to fight poverty and boost economic growth, it said.  Brazilian officials have made some progress in improving land rights in recent years through the Legal Land Program which has provided about 20,000 title deeds to Amazon farmers, the CPI said.Communication between officials at different government agencies responsible for registering land has also improved, Damasceno said, although progress has been slow.

From Wednesday, British Amazon Prime customers will be able to order supplies of products such as toilet paper, dishwasher tablets, dog food and coffee at the touch of the wifi-connected  Amazon Dash button.Each device is dedicated to a single product -- toilet roll, for instance -- with the brand's logo emblazoned on the buttons, which cost 4.99 pounds ($6.53) apiece. So if you wanted the service for two different products, you would need a separate device for each, though customers receive the cost of the device back in the form of a discount on their first order.Some customers thought the U.S. launch on March 31, 2015, was an April Fool's joke, said Daniel Rausch, director of Amazon Dash.But the service, as gimmicky as it may sound, appears to have caught the imagination of household goods manufacturers. Rausch said that more than 150 brands have joined the scheme in the United States, up from about 20 at launch, and that there has been a threefold increase in customer orders through the devices in the past two months, though the company gave no data on sales numbers.In Britain, Amazon Dash will launch with 48 brands in the scheme. The next step for Amazon is to automate the service entirely, so that appliances such as printers, vacuum cleaners and washing machines order new ink, bags and washing powder when they are running low.Companies including Bosch [ROBG.UL], Siemens, Samsung and Whirlpool are already working on integrating Dash Replenishment into their products, Rausch said.

1280,"  (Repeats story filed on Tuesday, no changes)* Washington warns $14.5 billion Irish bill may hurt relations* U.S. probe first alerted EU to tax schemes by Apple and others* Senator who chaired hearings blames IRS, says EU 'fills vacuum'By Foo Yun Chee and Alastair MacdonaldBRUSSELS, Aug 30 The United States is furious at the European Union for handing Apple Inc a $14.5 billion tax demand on Tuesday but EU officials say it was Washington which put them on to the scheme in the first place.It was a U.S. Senate report in May 2013 revealing the tech giant's deal with the Irish government to rule a big slice of its global earnings untaxable that prompted the European Commission to launch its own inquiries the following month.The U.S. Treasury said the Commission's order that Apple pay 13 billion euros in back taxes to Ireland - which the company and Dublin are appealing - endangers EU-U.S. economic relations just as efforts to reach a transatlantic free trade pact unravel . A senior Democratic senator said Brussels had made ""a cheap money grab"" for U.S. revenues.But his party colleague who chaired hearings into Apple's taxes three years ago, Carl Levin, said the Europeans were only trying to take what U.S. authorities had failed to claim by not closing loopholes that allowed firms to hoard profits overseas.""The IRS has failed to stake a claim for U.S. taxes on those revenues,"" he said in a statement, referring to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. ""So Europe attempts to fill the vacuum. Shame on Apple for dodging U.S. taxes. Shame on the IRS for failing to challenge Apple's tax avoidance.""For Marcel Fratzscher, president of leading German economic think-tank DIW Berlin and author of a new book on growing inequality, the mudslinging between politicians reflects how global corporations have exploited competition for investment to blunt states' efforts to co-operate against tax avoidance. ""Companies are playing one government against another,"" he told Reuters.EU LISTENED TO SENATE EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, a straight-talking Dane who dismisses talk of leading an anti-American crusade, says the hearings at the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations chaired by Levin were what gave her Spanish  predecessor grounds to demand disclosure by Apple and Ireland. ""The Commission listened and decided to look deeper into the matter,"" Vestager said in June, crediting media reporting and hearings in the British parliament for also providing evidence to help break secrecy around nearly 1,000 cases across Europe.The Commission said in its judgment on Apple that the United States and other countries were welcome to try and claim some of the unpaid taxes for themselves - highlighting just the complaints of Levin and other senators three years ago when they skewered Apple CEO Tim Cook for failing to bring cash home.As well as Apple, Starbucks Corp was ordered to pay more Dutch taxes and Amazon.com Inc and McDonald's Corp  are still being investigated; a series of EU accusations that Google, part of Alphabet Inc, has abused its market power have also fuelled complaints from U.S. President Barack Obama's administration that Europe is out to punish American success.Competition lawyer Pierre Sabbadini said political pressures drove different responses by different authorities. Leaks and public hearings on tax deals had created pressure among voters for the EU to act in 2013, he said, while the size of the companies targeted gave them clout with political leaders, too.""When investigation-target companies have grown to the size of Apple, they can reach out for political support,"" he said.The Obama administration has taken its own action to curb tax avoidance schemes lately. In April, amid public controversy over drug company Pfizer Inc's proposed merger with Allergan Plc of Ireland, it announced plans to curb so-called ""tax inversions"", by which U.S. firms have undertaken cross-border mergers in order to switch to a domicile abroad and so avoid U.S. taxes.Pfizer abandoned the merger.

1282,"   By Foo Yun Chee and Padraic Halpin | BRUSSELS/DUBLIN  BRUSSELS/DUBLIN The European Commission ordered Apple Inc to pay Ireland unpaid taxes of up to 13 billion euros ($14.5 billion) on Tuesday as it ruled the firm had received illegal state aid.Apple and Dublin said the U.S. company's tax treatment was in line with Irish and European Union law and they would appeal the ruling, which is part of a drive against what the EU says are sweetheart tax deals that usually smaller states in the bloc offer multinational companies to lure jobs and investment.The U.S. feels its firms are being targeted by the EU and a U.S. Treasury spokesperson warned the move threatens to undermine U.S. investment in Europe and ""the important spirit of economic partnership between the U.S. and the EU.""    Starbucks Corp has been ordered to pay up to 30 million euros ($33 million) to the Dutch state, while Amazon.com Inc and McDonald's Corp are also under investigation by the Commission, the EU's executive arm. Apple's stock fell less than 1 percent.EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager questioned how anyone might think an arrangement that allowed Apple to pay a tax rate of 0.005 percent, as Apple's main Irish unit did in 2014, was fair.""Tax rulings granted by Ireland have artificially reduced Apple's tax burden for over two decades, in breach of the EU state aid rules. Apple now has to repay the benefits,"" Vestager told a news conference.  Analysts said the size of the claim underlined the Commission's aggressive stance, but since each case involves different circumstances and tax rules, lawyers said it was hard to see if further big claims were any more or less likely.Apple, which had more than $200 billion in cash and readily marketable securities at the end of June, is likely to see the case drag out for years in EU and possibly Irish courts. Apple warned investors in a July regulatory filing that the Commission's investigation could lead to ""material"" liability for further tax payments, but that it could not estimate the impact. On Tuesday the company said it expects to place ""some amount of cash"" in an escrow account.Tax experts say the European Commission faces a tough battle to convince courts to back up its stand. While the EU has found that certain tax regulations are anti-competitive, it has never before ruled whether countries have applied tax regulations fairly in the way it has with Apple, Starbucks and others. As a result, some lawyers and accountants said they doubted Apple would end up paying back any tax.“I am not persuaded by the reasoning the EU has applied,” said Tim Wach, global managing director at international tax advisers Taxand. ""ARTIFICIAL"" ARRANGEMENT    The EU's ruling challenges the way that Ireland agreed to tax the profits of Irish-registered Apple subsidiaries, through which most of its non-U.S. profits flowed.Apple Inc licenses the rights to technology designed in the United States to Irish subsidiaries. These then hire contract manufacturers to make devices which they sell to Apple retail subsidiaries around Europe and Asia. Since the manufacturing cost is a small portion of device sales prices and retail subsidiaries are allocated a small operating margin, Apple Ireland is very profitable. In 2011, it earned $22 billion after paying $2 billion to its U.S. parent in relation to the rights to Apple intellectual property.However, the Irish tax authority agreed only 50 million euros of this was taxable in Ireland, the European Commission said. Under the terms of Apple’s tax deal, first agreed in 1991 and renewed in 2007, Apple could allocate most of the profits earned by its Irish operating units to a ""head office"" that did not have any employees or own any premises.“This 'head office' had no operating capacity to handle and manage the distribution business, or any other substantive business for that matter,” the Commission said.The Commission said this agreement had no basis in tax law and was not available to others, and so represented state aid.Irish Finance Minister Michael Noonan said he profoundly disagreed with the decision and in order to preserve Ireland’s attractiveness for investment he would appeal. ""There is no economic basis for this decision. It's bizarre and it's an exercise in politics by the Competition Commission,"" Noonan said.""They don't have responsibility for taxes and they are opening a back door through state aid to influence tax policy in European countries when the European treaties say tax policy is a matter for sovereign governments,"" he added.Ireland's low corporate tax rate has been a cornerstone of the country’s economic policy for decades, drawing investors from multinational companies whose staff account for almost one in 10 of the country's workers.For many technology firms like Google and Facebook, a key attraction is that Ireland allows companies to adopt tax structures which see them pay much less than the 12.5 percent headline rate. The companies say they follow all tax rules.Apple said it was confident of winning an appeal.""The European Commission has launched an effort to rewrite Apple’s history in Europe, ignore Ireland’s tax laws and upend the international tax system in the process,"" CEO Tim Cook said in a letter to customers posted on Apple's website. ""A company’s profits should be taxed in the country where the value is created,"" he added.U.S. OPPOSITION    The U.S. Treasury Department published a white paper last week in which it said it was looking at possible responses to what it sees as unfair targeting of its firms, which could include extra taxes on the U.S. arms of European companies.The paper noted that the EU executive's tax rulings could cost the U.S. exchequer money. Under U.S. tax law, Apple's Irish profits are taxable if brought back to the United States – something the company would have to do if it wanted to use the money to pay dividends.But any tax paid in Europe is reduced from the tax due in the United States. The Treasury has said the Commission’s approach was at odds with EU tax law and international treaties.The Commission, which has also ruled European companies including carmaker Fiat and Swedish engineer Atlas Copco AB must pay tax claims worth over $350 million, said its application of competition law to tax rulings followed EU law and treated all companies equally.Nonetheless, the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg have already appealed EU rulings against their tax deals with multinationals. Apple employs 5,500 people in areas such as logistics and distribution in the Irish city of Cork, which has about a quarter of Apple's Europe-based staff.

1285,"   By Alastair Macdonald and Foo Yun Chee | BRUSSELS  BRUSSELS Other multinationals that do not employ as extreme Irish tax schemes as Apple Inc but shift profits via the country to tax havens could also be breaching EU rules, Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said on Thursday.She handed the iPhone maker a record 13-billion-euro bill for Irish registered units that Dublin authorities accepted were liable to tax in no country on Tuesday. She told Reuters in an interview that other firms' arrangements, which involve routing profits to Irish-registered subsidiaries tax resident in places like Bermuda, might fall foul of the Commission on similar grounds.""Taxes have been paid nowhere due to the Irish tax code,"" she said.Asked if the bill would have been different if the head office of Apple's Irish unit been registered and paid tax in Bermuda, Vestager said: ""not much.""Vestager said the core of the case against Apple was that it had an Irish registered company that booked most of the profits generated across Europe. However, since Ireland didn't deem the subsidiary tax resident there, the unit was able to report just a small taxable income at an Irish ""branch.""Apple's chief executive, Tim Cook, and Washington have denounced the Commission ruling as an unjust raid on tax that should be paid in the United States. Apple's chief financial officer, Luca Maestri, told reporters on Tuesday that the assertion that Apple doesn't pay taxes anywhere on much of its profits is ""simply wrong.""""These are profits that are taxed in the United States, and for anybody that understands the U.S. worldwide tax system, this is very easy to understand,"" Maestri said. ""We actually accrue those tax liabilities on our balance sheet on an ongoing basis and we've done it consistently over the years.""  Vestager said if Washington chose to tax the profits reported by Apple's Irish operation, she would reduce her demand accordingly.The United States could do this by forcing Apple to have its Irish units pay more in fees to Apple in California for the right to license Apple patents.""If the U.S. tax authority found that the monies paid due to the cost-sharing agreement were too few ... so that they should pay more in the cost-sharing agreement, that would transfer more money to the States and that may change the books and the accounts in the States,"" Vestager said. Vestager said, however, that the bill would not be affected if Apple next year moved funds from its Irish units to the United States by paying dividends, even though in this case, the dividends would be taxed. She declined to discuss which other companies' affairs were being looked at by her staff beyond two publicly announced and outstanding investigations into Amazon (AMZN.O) and McDonald's (MCD.N) in Luxembourg. She said that since being alerted to Apple's methods and other cases by a U.S. Senate probe in 2013, the Commission has been looking through about 1,000 such instances in the EU.She dismissed accusations from Apple's Cook and others that her decision was politically motivated or driven by anti-American populism. While U.S. companies have been investigated, she said, most of 35 firms probed over tax in Belgium were from Europe, and those still being looked at were a broad sample.

1287,"   By David Shepardson | WASHINGTON, Sept 7  WASHINGTON, Sept 7 The top U.S. communications regulator plans on Thursday to unveil a revised plan to allow about 100 million pay TV subscribers to replace expensive set-top boxes with less-costly apps that provide access to television and video programs, two people briefed on the plan said.Federal Communications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler proposed in January opening the $20 billion cable and satellite TV set-top box market to new competitors and allow consumers to access multiple content providers from a single app or device.The plan, aimed at breaking the cable industry's long grip on the lucrative pay TV market and lowering prices for consumers, drew fierce opposition from TV and content providers, including AT&T Inc, Comcast Corp and Twenty-First Century Fox Inc.The FCC has said Americans spend $20 billion a year to lease pay-TV boxes, or an average of $231 annually. Set-top box rental fees have jumped 185 percent since 1994, while the cost of TVs, computers and mobile phones has dropped 90 percent, the FCC has estimated. The pay TV industry raised concerns over copyright, content licensing and privacy issues and made a counterproposal in June, offering to commit to creating its own apps to allow consumers to watch programs without needing to lease a box.Wheeler's revised plan is expected to include some components of the pay TV industry's proposal, and to exempt some smaller cable providers from the new requirements. The plan is also expected to create a licensing body to oversee the pay-TV apps, according to industry filings with the FCC. The revised application-based proposal is expected to come before the five-member commission for a vote on Sept. 29 at the commission's next meeting, the sources briefed on the matter said.Kim Hart, a spokeswoman for Wheeler, declined to comment. Disney, CBS, Viacom, Time Warner  Inc, Scripps Networks Inc and others met with Wheeler aides last week to discuss ""a revised approach... that would ensure that all of programmers' valuable content would remain inside of, and under the control of, apps developed exclusively by"" cable and other pay-TV providers, according to a filing with the FCC this week.These companies fear that rivals like Alphabet Inc  or Apple Inc could create devices or apps and insert their own content or advertising in cable content.Wheeler's January proposal would create a framework for device manufacturers and software developers to produce a single device or app to gain access to content from providers such as Netflix Inc, Amazon.com Inc, Hulu, Alphabet's YouTube and a pay-TV company.Wheeler has an aggressive agenda in the final months of the Obama administration. He wants the FCC to finalize a proposal to ensure privacy for broadband Internet users by barring providers from collecting user data without consent. He also wants to complete reforms of the $40 billion annual market for business data services known as special access lines.

Chanos estimates the combined company could have a cash burn of roughly $1 billion per quarter.""To burden your own balance sheet and cash flow statement to, in effect, bail out shareholders at SolarCity strikes us as just the height of folly,"" he said at the CNBC Institutional Investor Delivering Alpha Conference in New York.     Chanos had previously disclosed his bet against the shares of both companies in the spring. SolarCity shares were down about 5.4 percent in late trading  and shares in Tesla were down about 2 percent.Chanos, who rose to fame in the hedge-fund world predicting the collapse of Enron Corp in 2001, was reminded by the panel moderator that Tesla never seems to have trouble raising equity or debt. Chanos responded: ""Until they do.""""A lot of people aren't paying attention to the actual financial statements"" of the companies and the risks for Tesla, Chanos said.

1298,"  (Repeats Monday item)* Profits set to grow this year after four years of falls* Like-for-like sales seen rising for third quarter running* New CEO cuts prices to narrow gap with discounters* But over 60 pct of analysts rate stock as ""underperform""* Potts needs to cut prices more, analysts sayBy James DaveyLONDON, Sept 12 While investors have had their sights trained on the biggest names slugging it out in Britain's supermarket price war, one former struggler, Morrisons, may be embarking on a quiet revolution.Eighteen months after Chief Executive David Potts took over, the retailer is on course to return to profit growth this year after four years of falls caused largely by the rapid advance of German discounters Aldi and Lidl.That would put Morrisons, the fourth-largest supermarket group, on a par with market leader Tesco, which is expected to post a small rise, and ahead of second-biggest player Sainsbury which is set to post another fall.Analysts forecast Morrisons will report underlying pretax profit of 150 million pounds ($200 million) for the first half of the year on Thursday, up from 141 million in the same period of 2015.But Potts has yet to win over the doubters. Shares in the firm, which is based in the northern English city of Bradford, have risen 17 percent in the last year but remain a little below 204 pence, where they were when he joined on March 16, 2015. Over 60 percent of analysts rate the stock as ""underperform"".Morrisons is still losing market share but this is due to Potts's decision to close about 30 stores and sell a loss-making local convenience chain. On the measure of sales at stores open for over a year, he has made significant progress.The firm has reported two consecutive quarters of like-for-like sales growth, is expected to report a third on Thursday and given current forecasts is likely to be the strongest of the big four, which also includes Wal-Mart's  Asda, on that measure over the first half.There is also some evidence that the group may be in a stronger position than its peers to cope with the consequences of Britain's vote to leave the European Union. More tangibly, two deals with Amazon and Ocado to sell Morrisons products online could also boost profit. PATRIARCH Ken Morrison, the firm's boss for half a century and still its Life President, gives what by his standards is a ringing endorsement of Potts. ""I think he's doing very well, but there's still a lot of room for improvement,"" the 84-year-old son of the company's founder told Reuters.By contrast, the patriarch of a family that still owns almost 10 percent of the group once described the strategy pursued by Potts's predecessor Dalton Philips as ""bullshit"".Potts, 59, joined Morrisons after 39 years with Tesco where he began by stacking shelves. His initial task was to steady the ship after the group lost ground in its traditional northern market under Philips.Potts has slashed prices, narrowing the gap with the discounters. He has replenished shelves more rapidly, tailored products to local tastes and improved service with, for example, more self-scan and express checkouts.Analysts say he has also improved the look and condition of the group's 492 stores and sharpened up marketing, emphasising its army of more than 9,000 trained butchers, bakers, fishmongers and other specialists who prepare more food in-store than in other British supermarkets. The changes appear popular. Like-for-like transactions were up 3.1 percent in the first quarter, with sales volume growth up 3.3 percent.Analysts at Jefferies International, who have a 'buy' rating on the stock, say the firm is misunderstood.""Rarely have we seen such a negative combination of views both from investors and sell siders,"" they said, noting that about 21 percent of Morrisons' freefloat stock is on loan for short-selling by investors who expect the price to fall.NAYSAYERS Naysayers highlight the intensely competitive nature of the British grocery market, saying Potts needs to go even further on price cuts, and fear a fight back by industry laggard Asda, the British arm of U.S. giant Wal-Mart.Morrisons has invested heavily in food production and packing and now has 14 plants, making it Britain's second biggest food manufacturer and most integrated food retailer. While data is sparse, Morrisons says it imports less of the food it sells than the 40 percent industry average.This would make it less exposed than rivals to the pound's fall of 9 percent against the euro and 11 percent against the dollar after Britons opted for Brexit. Potts has cut prices twice since the referendum on June 23.Morrisons also has a very small non-food offer, shunning the trend of other big supermarkets which sell everything from coffee makers to washing machines and TVs. With many of those goods imported, here too Morrisons is less exposed to the currency swings.It is also less exposed to the risk of a post-Brexit economic slowdown and a resulting drop in consumer confidence which would particularly damage demand for bigger purchases. Such a slowdown has yet to materialise but remains expected by many economists.Phoenix Asset Management, which owns nearly 1 percent of Morrisons according to Reuters data, has estimated the firm's food production capacity has grown to about three times the size it was a decade ago. However, it says productivity, or volume growth, has not kept track, meaning it has scope to raise output.A wholesale supply deal struck by Potts with U.S. online giant Amazon in February gives Morrisons the opportunity to increase volume with little additional capital expenditure, boosting profitability.Amazon's own assault on the UK grocery market is focused on London, where Morrisons is weak and has little share to lose but where Tesco and Sainsbury's are strong.Morrisons is also benefiting from its own belated move online through a partnership with Ocado, a deal that Potts re-negotiated, paying less upfront and holding on to more profit.It also wants to expand the wholesale of its own-label foods through an alliance with Motor Fuel Group (MFG) Britain's second largest independent forecourt operator.BALANCE SHEET STRENGTH Morrisons has significantly strengthened its balance sheet, with net debt forecast to be as low as 1.4 billion pounds ($1.86 billion) by the end of its 2016-17 year, down from a peak of 2.82 billion pounds in 2014.Clive Black, analyst at the group's broker Shore Capital, says Morrisons stands apart with a lease-adjusted net debt/earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and rent (EBITDAR) ratio of 2.4 times. This compares with a forecast of 3.9 times for Sainsbury and 4.6 times for Tesco.Black said that if trading remains sound and debt reduction continues, Morrisons may be able to consider something to please  shareholders, such as a share buyback, over the next 18 months.

1303,"  LONDON British upmarket grocer Waitrose has scaled back plans for new stores but will add more cafes and bakeries to existing shops,  while owner John Lewis shifts its investment into logistics and technology as online shopping booms.Waitrose Managing Director Rob Collins told reporters on a results conference call on Thursday that the group had scrapped plans to open seven new supermarkets in the next two years, although it would still proceed with two new main stores and five convenience shops. That resulted in an exceptional charge of 25 million pounds ($33 million) that pushed John Lewis's first-half pretax profit down 74.6 percent to 56.9 million pounds. Excluding the  charge, pretax profit fell 14.7 percent to 81.9 million pounds.Other British supermarkets such as Tesco (TSCO.L) and Sainsbury's (SBRY.L) have also made property writedowns as they close some stores and halt plans to open others as consumers switch from big weekly shops at out-of-town hypermarkets to buying more online and locally.However, John Lewis Chairman Charlie Mayfield said he did not expect Britain's vote to leave the European Union to affect sales in the second half of the year, although the weaker pound could eventually cause some inflationary pressures.Collins, who took over in April, said an important part of the Waitrose strategy in future would be the ""food-to-go"" market, which research group IGD has predicted will grow 6.8 percent in 2016 to 16.1 billion pounds.  Waitrose ""hospitality"" sales from more than 200 in-store cafes, bakeries, wine and juice bars rose 7.1 percent in the first half and Collins said those offerings brought a significant ""halo"" effect to the grocery business. Waitrose's premium offering and loyal middle class clientele  has helped it gain market share as other British supermarkets have lost out to the rise of discounters Aldi and Lidl, which has pushed prices down across the sector.However, Aldi has now overtaken Waitrose as Britain's sixth-biggest grocer and its market share has slipped slightly in recent months to 5.1 percent. For the first six weeks of the second half from Aug. 1, Waitrose's gross sales rose a like-for-like 1.4 percent, improving from a 1 percent fall in the first half, when sales online rose 4.3 percent to account for just over 5 percent of sales.Collins said the improvement was partly due to the launch in May of the new Waitrose 1 premium range, which grouped new lines with existing own-brand ranges, helping sales jump 19.4 percent. Facing stiff competition from online rivals such as Amazon (AMZN.O), John Lewis saw like-for-like sales growth slow at its department stores unit to 0.7 percent in the first six weeks of the second half from 3.1 percent in the first half.As its ecommerce booms, John Lewis said investment in technology and distribution now represented 55 percent of total capital spending, up from 48 percent last year.($1 = 0.7553 pounds) (Reporting by Emma Thomasson; Editing by Susan Thomas, Greg Mahlich)",2016-09-15,AMZN,"Thu Sep 15, 2016 | 9:35am EDT",UK's Waitrose cuts new store plans to invest in food-to-go,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-john-lewis-results-idUSKCN11L0HT?type=companyNews

It is expected to start operations this year and will have an annual capacity of 90 million tonnes, or more than a quarter of Vale's 2015 iron ore output. The first iron ore sale from S11D is expected in early 2017, Vale's press office in Rio de Janeiro said. The newly-licensed branch line has faced opposition from environmentalists and aboriginal groups because it runs close to indigenous areas by heavily degraded parts of Brazil's Amazon rainforest.

1306,"   By Jason Lange | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Apple Inc and other U.S. multinationals will face new curbs on tax loopholes under a rule imposed by Washington on Thursday, part of a scramble among governments worldwide to bolster their corporate tax bases.Acting shortly after a European Union grab for billions of dollars in back taxes from Apple, the U.S. Treasury said it was tightening restrictions on companies' use of foreign tax credits to reduce what they owe in U.S. taxes.""We are closing another tax loophole that contributes to the erosion of our tax base,"" Treasury Assistant Secretary for Tax Policy Mark Mazur said in a statement. The fight for multinational tax revenues escalated on Aug. 30 when the EU ruled Ireland was giving improper state aid to Apple in the form of a deal for low taxes. The EU ordered Apple to pay Ireland 13 billion euros ($14.6 billion) in back taxes, prompting U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew to express concern the EU ruling could undermine the U.S. tax base.Analysts have speculated whether Apple would be able to cut its U.S. tax bill by claiming foreign tax credits for its extra tax bill in Ireland.  Under normal circumstances, U.S. companies can reduce the taxes they owe the U.S. government by the value of the tax credits they claim for taxes paid abroad on foreign profits. No U.S. tax is due on those profits until they are brought into the United States, or repatriated.The new rule will prevent companies faced with back tax bills from ""splitting,"" a strategy that allows companies to bring foreign tax credits into the United States without repatriating the income from which they were derived. Apple had no comment on Treasury's tax notice. The technology giant is not the only U.S. company in the crosshairs of EU state aid investigations.Starbucks Corp has been ordered to pay up to 30 million euros ($33 million) to the Dutch state, while Amazon.com Inc and McDonald's Corp are under investigation by the EU's executive arm.The new rule was likely to ratchet up transatlantic tensions over corporate taxes while eliminating one more strategy U.S. companies can use to cushion the blow from increasingly aggressive EU tax collection efforts. The tax notice specifically cited European Union state aid investigations as a risk to U.S. revenues.The Treasury had no comment on whether its notice would have an impact on Apple directly, but a spokesperson said the notice applies to all companies required by a foreign government to pay additional taxes, including those hit by state-aid cases.

1307,"   By Guy Faulconbridge | NEW YORK  NEW YORK British Prime Minister Theresa May met business chiefs from firms including Goldman Sachs (GS.N), IBM (IBM.N) and Amazon.com (AMZN.O) on Monday in an attempt to reassure investors after her country's shock vote to leave the European Union.The June 23 vote took many investors and chief executives by surprise, triggering the deepest political and financial turmoil in Britain since World War Two and the biggest ever one-day fall in sterling against the dollar.""Every working day in the United Kingdom one million people wake up and go to work for an American company. And every day in the United States one million people wake up and go to work for a UK company,"" May told the business leaders. ""So you see there is reciprocity,"" said May, who is in New York to attend the United Nations General Assembly. ""The UK is going to be out there. We will be looking ‎for business. And ladies and gentlemen, please feel free to invest in the UK.""May said that she wanted to hear what issues business leaders wanted addressed in the Brexit negotiations, which she said would yield a good deal in the trade of goods and services with the EU.Chief executives from AECOM (ACM.N), Morgan Stanley (MS.N), BlackRock (BLK.N), Merck & Co (MRK.N), Sony Pictures and United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) also attended the meeting. The head of Thomson Reuters (TRI.TO), the parent company of Reuters News, also attended. May first had a closed meeting with major investors and Wall Street banks before addressing dozens of other executives at a wider reception. Despite warnings before the vote that Brexit would shatter economic confidence, some positive economic data and SoftBank's $32 billion takeover of Britain's technology company ARM have stoked the perception that Britain could prosper outside the EU. Still, May and her ministers admit they need to reassure  investors from the United States, Japan, China and India that the United Kingdom and London, the only financial capital to rival New York, are still good places to make money.The United States is the largest single inward investor into Britain, which currently attracts far more foreign direct investment than any other EU member.When asked what they wanted to hear from May, one business leader at the meeting who asked not to be named said: ""Reassurance.""  ""BREXIT MEANS BREXIT"" Some investors have called for clarity about how much access foreign companies based or operating out of Britain will have to the European market, a concern for some U.S. banks and manufacturers which sell into the EU from Britain.Other issues include when and how Brexit will happen. May, who has repeatedly pledged that ""Brexit means Brexit"", has so far said only that she will not trigger the formal EU divorce process before the end of this year.""‎We will be getting the right deal for the United Kingdom and that is the right deal in terms of trade in goods and services because we recognize the importance of both,"" May said. ""At the same time we want to scope out new deals around the world to further liberalize trade between the UK and other partners around the world,"" she added. U.S. President Barack Obama said this month that he wanted the Brexit process to be resolved in the least disruptive way possible, though both France and Germany face elections next year which could complicate the Brexit negotiations.Before the vote, some U.S. companies had warned that Brexit would complicate their lives and could cost jobs. Those included JPMorgan Chase Chief Executive Jamie Dimon, who has 16,000 staff based in Britain.British companies reduced their investment plans in the month after Britain voted to leave the EU, a survey by Lloyds Bank showed on Monday, a further sign the decision is likely to have a lasting impact on the economy.Last month, the Bank of England left its forecast for British growth this year steady at 2.0 percent but cautioned that there might be little growth in the second half and sharply downgraded its forecast for 2017 to just 0.8 percent from a previous estimate of 2.3 percent.""What I really wanted to talk to you about tonight is just very simply to say this: Britain is open for business,"" May said.

Advent and CVC have already invested in Poland - the latter with an investment last year in railway utility PKP Energetyka which the government wants to annul. With over 14 million clients, Allegro competes with eBay (EBAY.O) and Amazon (AMZN.O) as well as OLX.pl, which is also owned by Naspers.Poland's e-commerce market is expected to grow by 15 percent in 2016 to 35.8 billion zlotys and to 63 billion by 2020, according to Sociomantic Labs.  Allegro is the largest e-commerce investment for Naspers - Africa's largest company by market value.Naspers has transformed itself from an apartheid-era publisher into a $65 billion Internet powerhouse by focusing on e-commerce in emerging markets.It operates in over 130 countries with stakes in Russian internet group Mail.Ru Group (MAILRq.L) and in Tencent Holdings (0700.HK), China's biggest social network and online entertainment company. Naspers raised $2.5 billion in December 2015 to fund acquisitions.

1312,"  RIO DE JANEIRO Brazil's Vale SA said on Monday output from its new S11D iron ore mine in the Amazon region will be limited to 83 percent of full capacity as efforts to preserve cash and limit transport disruptions crimp a needed railway expansion.The $14.3 billion project, Vale's biggest-ever investment, was widely expected to produce up to 90 million metric tonnes a year of iron ore - the key ingredient in steel making - after a two-year ramp-up scheduled to begin by year-end.But S11D will only deliver up to 75 million metric tonnes to international sea-borne clients after a four-year ramp-up, Vale said, responding to an article last week in Britain's Financial Times business newspaper.""There has been a replanning of the execution of construction work on the logistics corridor in a phased form in order to minimize interference with existing operations and optimize our cash flow without increasing the project's capital spending,"" Vale said.In the article, Vale iron ore chief Peter Poppinga said investors understand the company's expansion plans.Vale, struggling with slumping iron ore prices which have slid nearly 60 percent in three years as well as delays completing S11D, has been slashing expenditures and selling assets. S11D is expected to help Vale cut its per-tonne ore costs while helping drive higher-cost competitors from the market as demand falls.    Despite limits on the amount of S11D can ship to clients, Vale said there will be no change to the mine's official capacity of 90 million tonnes. The S11D mine, also known as Serra Sul, is one of two giant iron-ore mines in Vale's sprawling Carajas resource complex in Brazil's northern state of Para. The other mine, Serra Norte, is producing 155 million tonnes a year.The Carajas railway which carries the ore to the Port of Ponta da Madeira near Sao Luis, Brazil for export to international clients, will only be able to carry 230 million tonnes of ore in four years despite a major expansion for S11D, Vale said.Vale did not say whether it will increase the $7.9 billion already spent on S11D-related rail and port expansions in the future to allow the mine to ship up to 90 million tonnes per year. ""It's important to remember that, as it has already be repeated, that Vale will produce based on market demand, Vale said in response to questions from Reuters.Vale also confirmed the information published in the Financial Times.

1313,"  * European shares nudge up; Wall St set for higher open* Fed, BOJ begin two-day policy meetings* Yen edges up on speculation BOJ could disappoint* Oil fades after brief rally on MondayBy Marc JonesLONDON, Sept 20 Shares made modest gains and the dollar lost ground against the yen on Tuesday as investors awaited the outcomes of Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan policy meetings that will conclude on Wednesday.Nagging doubts about the firepower left available to top central banks and a slip in oil prices saw the pan-European STOXX 600 index dip in and out of the red after seven falls in the last 10 days. It was up 0.3 percent but the oil and gas sector slipped 0.7 percent.Wall Street was set for modest gains at the open, according to stock index futures .Crude prices slipped after major producer Venezuela, mired in economic crisis, said oil markets were effectively 10 percent oversupplied.The yen was marginally stronger in the currency markets on speculation the Bank of Japan may do little more than tinker with its stimulus programme and that the Federal Reserve is likely to stay guarded about its rate hike plans.""Everybody is just waiting for the BOJ and the Fed - why do anything today?"" said Commerzbank currency strategist Esther Reichelt in Frankfurt. ""Everyone has already positioned for these events and there is no new information that could give them a reason to reposition.""The yen was changing hands at 101.91 per dollar. It has risen almost 20 percent over the past 12 months despite the BOJ's best efforts to weaken it. The euro was flat at $1.11750.Sterling fell 0.5 percent to $1.2955, a five-week low, on worries about the political and economic risks of Britain's pending exit from the European Union.""The noise on Brexit over the past week has given us more reason to sell any rallies,"" said Tobias Davis, head of corporate treasury sales at Western Union in London.The pre-BOJ and Fed caution kept European bond market moves small too, although longer-dated euro zone government yields edged lower with the BOJ expected to try to lever investors away from its longer-maturity bonds. The yield on 30-year German Bunds fell 6 basis points to 0.58 percent, and there were similar moves on equivalent Dutch, Finnish, French and Spanish paper.Other euro zone bond yields also fell, if not quite so sharply. Germany's 10-year Bund, the region's benchmark bond, dropped 2.8 bps, turning back into negative territory, while Portugal saw a second day of outperformance.British Prime Minister Theresa May met U.S. business chiefs from firms including Goldman Sachs, IBM and Amazon on Monday in New York to try and reassure investors, while German leader Angela Merkel appeared rueful over the refugee crisis.""If I could, I would turn back time by many, many years,"" Merkel said.For Reuters new Live Markets blog on European and UK stock markets see reuters://realtime/verb=Open/url=http://emea1.apps.cp.extranet.thomsonreuters.biz/cms/?pageId=livemarkets EMERGING DRAMA While holding patterns predominated in major markets, plenty of action was on the cards in emerging ones.Hungary's central bank was expected to stick to its unconventional easing policy following a surprise S&P upgrade to investment grade on Friday that has bolstered its high-flying stock and bond markets and the forint.Nigeria, which in contrast was downgraded on Friday, also has a central bank meeting. A Reuters poll shows it is expected to stay on hold before hiking interest rates later in the year. Its finance minister, though, made a strident call for a cut on Monday.In Asia overnight, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slipped 0.1 percent.Australian shares finished slightly higher. The Australian Securities Exchange opened without incident on Tuesday after technical faults caused extensive disruptions on Monday.Japan's Nikkei erased its early gains to end 0.2 percent lower as trading resumed after a public holiday on Monday. Tokyo markets will also be closed on Thursday, with the BOJ meeting sandwiched in between.Oil fell nearly 1 percent to $45.51 per barrel, having briefly rallied on Monday on Venezuela's bid to talk up a potential OPEC output freeze. That soon fizzled on indications that U.S. crude stockpiles had risen again last week.Gold though added 0.1 percent to $1,314 an ounce, on expectations that the Fed will stand pat on rates when it ends its two-day meeting on Wednesday.

His role will be split between Chief Information Officer Mike McNamara and Chief Merchandising Officer Mike Tritton.

1323,"   By Promit Mukherjee and Supantha Mukherjee | MUMBAI  MUMBAI Oct 4 India's two largest e-commerce players are looking to use the country's biggest festive sales season this week to bolster their valuations as they seek fresh capital and look to fend off Amazon's growing inroads into the domestic market.For India's Flipkart (IPO-FLPK.N) and Snapdeal, strong sales during India's equivalent of the U.S. Black Friday sales could give both companies some leverage in their current push for investment.With private equity money flows drying up and Amazon.com  pledging $5 billion investment to gain ground in India, local e-commerce vendors will be looking to use this season's numbers to show investors their ability to drive sales.Flipkart (IPO-FLPK.N) is currently in talks with retail giant Wal-Mart Stores and a strong showing of sales during this week could give it more negotiating leverage. Snapdeal is also preparing to raise fresh capital to defend its turf. The high stakes battle between Flipkart's Big Billion Day sales bonanza, Amazon's Great Indian Festival sale and Snapdeal's own initiative dubbed the Unbox Diwali Sale, means employees at all three players are working marathon hours to meet stiff sales targets.""Our teams are working around the clock during Big Billion Days,"" said a spokesperson for Flipkart, adding that many are camping out in office for the week, and working 14-18 hour days in a bid to keep up with frenzied demand. All three companies say their sales seasons have so far been successful, but did not comment on how the sales momentum is stacking up against their own internal targets.Flipkart says it sold 2.25 million units in the first 12 hours of its 5-day sale, which kicked off on Sunday. Its closest competitor Amazon India said it sold 1.5 million units in the first 12 hours of its sale that began on Saturday. Amazon said its first day of sales was three times higher than the corresponding first day sales last year while second day sales were five times higher.Snapdeal said more than 2 million users logged in on the first hour of its sales, leading to more than 180 orders per second at launch.""With companies under pressure to make money, they don't want to let the opportunity go to a competitor...you can't keep burning cash by offering huge discounts,"" said Devangshu Dutta, chief executive of retail consultancy Third Eyesight.

1324,"   By Mitra Taj | LIMA  LIMA Peruvian state-owned energy company Petroperu will ask local communities to help protect its oil pipeline from the vandalism that it blames for several leaks in the Amazon this year, the company's new president said Monday.The 687-mile (1,106-km) pipeline, which spans a vast expanse of jungle to feed Petroperu's refinery on the Pacific coast, should resume operations in four to five months after repairs, said Augusto Baertl, a former mining executive responsible for running Petroperu in the new government of President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski.Government officials previously said it would take at least a year to reopen the pipeline, shuttered since February after a leak.Petroperu's pipeline has spilled more than 7,000 barrels of oil in the Amazon this year from at least seven leaks because of poor maintenance or vandalism, according to data from environmental regulator Oefa.The pollution has triggered a month-long protest by indigenous communities in the region of Loreto.Baertl said some local residents may have cut the pipeline to bring cleanup jobs to far-flung towns neglected by authorities. To prevent additional damage, Petroperu must improve community ties, Baertl said. ""Petroperu is not seen as an ally to the community, and that's causing us problems,"" Baertl said in an interview.Petroperu will ask communities to deploy watchdog groups to safeguard the pipeline and monitor environmental impacts, Baertl said. The company also wants to coordinate with NGOs to set up programs to promote development in the region.Baertl said one of his priorities would be to make Petroperu more environmentally responsible after Oefa ordered the company to repair or replace shoddy parts of the 40-year-old pipeline and fined it $3.5 million for ""repeated and systematic failure of its environmental obligations."" The pipeline transported less than 15,000 barrels of oil a day before the spills, but its closure has been a drag on economic growth as it has halted production from two oil blocks.Petroperu mainly transports and commercializes oil products in Peru, a small producer of crude.Baertl said he did not think the company was ready to take part in oil production, once a goal of the previous government. ""I'm not ruling it out, but it looks very difficult to me. We don't have people capable of doing it and we don't have the money,"" Baertl said.Instead, the company will focus on the $4.8 billion expansion of its Talara refinery, which is about 45 to 50 percent finished, Baertl said.

1326,"   By Se Young Lee | SEOUL  SEOUL Tech giant Samsung Electronics Co Ltd said on Thursday it is acquiring U.S. artificial intelligence (AI) platform developer Viv Labs Inc, a firm run by a co-creator of Apple Inc's Siri voice assistant program.Samsung said in a statement it plans to integrate the San Jose-based company's AI platform, called Viv, into the Galaxy smartphones and expand voice-assistant services to home appliances and wearable technology devices.Financial terms were not disclosed. Technology firms are locked in an increasingly heated race to make AI good enough to let consumers interact with their devices more naturally, especially via voice. Alphabet Inc's Google is widely considered to be the leader in AI, but others including Amazon.com, Apple and Microsoft have also launched their own offerings including voice-powered digital assistants.Samsung, the world's top smartphone maker, is also hoping to differentiate its devices, from phones to fridges, by incorporating AI. The acquisition of Viv could help the Korean firm shore up its competitiveness at a time when Google's new Pixel smartphones - armed with the U.S. firm's voice-powered digital assistant - threatens Samsung and other smartphone makers who are largely reliant on the Android operating platform.             ""Viv brings in a very unique technology to allow us to have an open system where any third-party service and content providers (can) add their services to our devices' interfaces,"" Rhee In-jong, Samsung's executive vice president, told Reuters in an interview.The executive said Samsung needs to ""really revolutionize"" how its devices operate, moving towards using voice rather than simply touch. ""We can't innovate using only in-house technology,"" Rhee said.     Viv chief executive and co-founder Dag Kittlaus, a Siri co-creator, and other top managers at the firm will continue managing the business independently following the acquisition. Rhee told Reuters Samsung will continue to look for acquisitions to bolster its AI and other software capabilities, without naming any targets.

1330,"   By Nandita Bose | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) is accelerating its investment in e-commerce in a bid to narrow the gap with Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and to give it an even more dominant position against the rest of the field in retail. The world's largest retailer is now on track to double the number of giant warehouses dedicated to online sales to 10 by the end of 2016, according to Justen Traweek, vice-president of e-commerce supply chain and fulfillment.That pace is faster than the 8 large warehouses that industry consultants expected Wal-Mart to build by the end of 2017.At the same time, Wal-Mart in the last year has installed new technology such as automated product sorting and improved item tracking that for the first time puts them on par with Amazon's robot-staffed facilities, according to supply-chain consultants.""We have doubled our capacity in the last twelve months and that allows us to ship to a majority of the U.S. population in one day,"" Traweek said.Wal-Mart is holding its annual investor day on Thursday when, among other topics, it is expected to update on the progress it has made in its e-commerce business. Wal-Mart, which has about 4,600 stores in the United States and over 6,000 worldwide, has been investing in e-commerce for 15 years, but it still lags far behind Amazon.     ""These additions definitely give Wal-Mart the opportunity to compete better than other companies going head-to-head with Amazon,"" said Steve Osburn, director of supply chain with consultancy Kurt Salmon, referring to the likes of Target (TGT.N) and others. ""Having said that, choosing to race with Amazon is different than catching up with them.""Wal-Mart in the last four fiscal years has accelerated its investment in e-commerce and digital initiatives, excluding acquisitions, from about $300 million in 2013 to $1.1 billion this year for a total of about $3 billion, according to public filings and earnings transcripts. E-commerce accounts for about 3 percent of Wal-Mart's overall sales.  Since 2011, Wal-Mart has acquired 15 e-commerce startups, one of which became its core Silicon Valley technology arm, @WalmartLabs. Last month, it completed its purchase of online retailer Jet.com for about $3 billion and named Jet's founder, Marc Lore, the head of Wal-Mart's e-commerce business. The massive warehouses are key to Wal-Mart's e-commerce strategy because they enable the company to deliver packages more economically when shipping online orders with multiple items. Fulfilling such orders now can often mean multiple shipments from different warehouses or stores.""This improves two fundamental things: Wal-Mart's speed to market, which is how fast their products reach consumers, and it will help them reach an even larger audience,"" said Regenia Sanders, vice-president of supply chain at consultancy SSA & Co.     Even with Wal-Mart's new investments, though, Amazon has a commanding position in e-commerce with 40 warehouses of one million-plus square feet and plans to open five more by the first quarter of next year, according to data compiled for Reuters by retail technology firm ChannelAdvisor.Its online sales of $107 billion last year far outstrip Wal-Mart's $13.7 billion of online sales in the same period. The ten warehouses are designed to boost its overall distribution capabilities, which consists of smaller online warehouses, stores that stock online orders and 160 store serving distribution centers that stock online items. Amazon runs 104 warehouses and has announced 18 new ones, according to ChannelAdvisor data. An Amazon spokeswoman did not comment on specific questions for this story, but did say the company is laser focused on its customers and delivering unlimited, fast, free Prime Shipping.TRYING TO NARROW THE GAP   Inside Wal-Mart's 1.2 million square-foot warehouse in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, two 40-foot robotic towers shuttle products like Cheerio's from storage to packaging. It handles more than 70 percent of the orders for best-selling products, Traweek said.Workers inside wear smart-phone like devices on their wrists that tell them where to find a product, what box it needs to got into and even how much tape is required to seal the package.    The devices give Wal-Mart the ability to store items anywhere in the warehouse and increase efficiency and lower costs, Traweek said, though he would not detail cost savings.     The new warehouses allow Wal-Mart to now ship orders to 70 percent of Americans in a day, Traweek said, but it cannot yet do so profitably. That's why it has not yet begun to promise one-day delivery to customers, he said. Charles Sizemore, founder of Sizemore Capital Management LLC which owns Wal-Mart shares, said investors expect profitable growth from Wal-Mart, while Amazon is still given leeway to lose money in the hunt for longer-term growth.    ""Anything that crimps Wal-Mart's profits in the short term will not be met well by their shareholders, so trying to find a cost-effective shipping solution is a sensible approach,"" he said.Wal-Mart plans to complete at least one more giant warehouse, in addition to the ten, by the first quarter of 2017, Traweek said. The retailer had worked with five giant warehouses since launching its online business in 2000.

More than 14,000 seasonal positions were transitioned to regular, full-time roles after the holidays last year, and the company expects to increase that number this year, Amazon said on Thursday.

1332,"  Wearable camera maker GoPro Inc (GPRO.O) said on Thursday it temporarily stopped selling its latest HERO5 camera model on Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) in the United States as the company negotiates pricing with the online retailer.GoPro's shares fell as much as 3.8 percent, on track for its worst six-day drop since May.The company will resume supplying to Amazon at the end of the month or in early November, a GoPro spokeswoman said.""Most likely, GoPro is temporarily, but intentionally, not shipping to Amazon following a not-uncommon pricing squabble, when a retailer lists the product below the agreed-upon floor price,"" said Longbow Research analyst Joe Wittine.A number of retailers, including Best Buy Inc (BBY.N) and Target Corp (TGT.N), match prices for products on e-commerce platforms like Amazon. GoPro launched a slew of products last month, including the HERO5 Black and HERO5 Session cameras and the Karma drone, ahead of the crucial holiday season.GoPro depends on Amazon for about 12-14 percent of its total revenue, said Piper Jaffray analyst Errin Murphy. The company receives more than half of its revenue from the United States. However, some analysts said the concerns may be premature.""September or early October is a slow sales month anyway as people gear up for the holiday season,"" said Oppenheimer analyst Andrew Uerkwitz.

""This stock is priced for perfection, and if they deliver merely perfection it will go down,"" in the short-term, said Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles. ""I would be cautious about trading into their earnings,"" he said, adding that he thinks that the stock will be worth more than it is currently a year from now. The company reports quarterly results on Oct. 27, and is expected to post a 28.9 percent growth in revenues, to $32.6 billion and a 370.4 percent increase in earnings per share, to $0.80, according to Thomson Reuters data. Amazon Prime customers tend to be wealthier, younger and spend approximately $2,500 on the site per year, a level approximately 4.5 times greater than non-members, according to Morgan Stanley.  The company is focused on grabbing more of these customer's overall spending by moving them into Amazon's low-margin grocery stores and other bricks-and-mortar retail locations. But that strategy could backfire, eating into profits at a time when many investors are expecting Amazon to post significant earnings growth. Short interest, a measure of how many investors are betting that the stock will go down, is up 36 percent, to $4.1 billion, from its average last year, according to Ihor Dusaniwsky, head of research at financial analytics firm S3 Partners. Amazon declined to comment for this story.The company has added 20 percent more U.S. Prime members this calendar year, to about 12 million, which is still well below the approximately 30 million U.S. households that purchased goods on Amazon since January, according to estimates by John Blackledge, an analyst at Cowen and Company.  Even so, the level of spending required for the company's expansion plans is not being accurately reflected in its share price, which were up more than 6 percent to $816.56 on Friday, said Robert Peck, an analyst at SunTrust. ""We remain believers in the long-term story,"" Peck said. However, in the medium-term, SunTrust believes Amazon shares are baking in expectations of significant revenue growth while not taking into account the capital expenditures required to support the growth, he said.Should the company fail to meet investor's high expectations, any sell-off would be a buying opportunity, said Paul Greene, portfolio manager of the $3.9 billion T Rowe Price Media and Telecommunications fund. At 10 percent of assets, Amazon has long been the fund's top holding, Greene said, and he would buy more shares if not for rules that limit his concentration in individual stocks.

1343,"   By Gina Cherelus | New York  New York An Amazon.com Inc delivery contractor in New York City has agreed to pay $100,000 in back wages to drivers after making deductions for lunch breaks that the workers never took, the state attorney general's office said on Friday. The company, Cornucopia Logistics, delivers Amazon.com packages and food from Amazon Fresh to resident and commercial locations in the city. Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said in a statement that the settlement will allow short-changed workers, who would often miss meals because of heavy delivery schedules, to receive the restitution. More than 100 current and former drivers, driver's helpers and messengers are affected by the settlement, which the attorney general's office will formerly announce later on Friday.  “Delivery workers travel all hours of the day and night and through all kinds of weather to meet tight time frames,"" Schneiderman said. ""They deserve to have a proper lunch break, and when they don’t, they certainly must be properly compensated for all of their work.”Representatives for Cornucopia Logistics and Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment. According to New York state labor laws, employers are required to pay workers for all hours worked and provide periods for meal breaks, typically a half hour. Under terms of the settlement, Cornucopia must designate an internal officer to ensure labor law compliance as well as provide the attorney general's office with quarterly reports and payroll documents, the statement said.  Amazon announced on Thursday an expansion of its Amazon Fresh service to Chicago and Dallas. In addition to New York, the food delivery service already operates in Virginia, Boston, California and Pennsylvania, among other locations.

1348,"   By Jonathan Stempel  A federal judge on Thursday directed Amazon.com Inc to set up a year-long process to reimburse parents whose children made in-app purchases without permission, but rejected a U.S. regulator's request for a $26.5 million lump-sum payout.U.S. District Judge John Coughenour, in Amazon's hometown of Seattle, issued his order more than six months after finding the online retailer liable, in a case brought by the Federal Trade Commission.The FTC in July 2014 accused Amazon of making it too easy for children to run up bills while playing games such as ""Pet Shop Story"" and ""Ice Age Village"" on mobile devices, resulting in an estimated $86 million of unauthorized charges.Thursday's order calls for Amazon to set up a notice-and-claims process beginning in early 2017 to alert parents of their eligibility for refunds, and then to reimburse them. Coughenour said this approach ""removes the uncertainty of the proper lump sum amount that the parties have vigorously disputed. Moreover, it accomplishes the goals of placing liability on Amazon and refunding eligible customers.""Coughenour called the FTC's $26.5 million damages request ""too high,"" agreeing with Amazon that it might have taken into account failed password attempts unrelated to unauthorized purchases by children. But the judge rejected Amazon's request to issue refunds in the form of gift cards, saying the company would ""undoubtedly recapture some of the profits that are at issue.""Neither Amazon nor the FTC immediately responded to requests for comment. The FTC in 2014 settled similar cases against Apple Inc and Google Inc, now part of Alphabet Inc, with Apple agreeing to refund at least $32.5 million and Google at least $19 million.All three companies have improved their password and other controls to help thwart unauthorized charges.

1352,"   By Nandita Bose | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Target Corp (TGT.N) on Wednesday reported a much higher-than-expected quarterly profit after benefiting from a strong back-to-school shopping season and increased online sales, and it gave an optimistic outlook for the all-important holiday period.The Minneapolis-based retailer's shares, which had fallen nearly 2 percent so far this year, rose 6.4 percent to end at $76.03. Results have improved from recent quarters, when competition from online rivals like Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and slower sales of smaller items like electronics and food hurt Target's earnings. The company had to shake up its top leadership, with three high-profile exits in the past four months. Target's sales for the third quarter ended on Oct. 29 showed the company was still losing market share, said Neil Saunders, chief executive officer of research firm Conlumino.""Although Target's performance has improved, it would be wrong to say that it is now a company firing on all cylinders,"" he said. The company said demand for Apple Inc (AAPL.O) merchandise, which had been disappointing in the second quarter, improved because of new products like the iPhone 7. Ahead of the holidays, advance orders for the brand were three times higher than a year earlier,  Target said it expected consumer spending to remain strong through the holidays. Last week, department store rivals Macy's Inc (M.N) and Kohl's Corp (KSS.N) forecast an acceleration this quarter.Target CEO Brian Cornell said store visits increased and sales trends improved by a percentage point during the third quarter.Digital sales jumped 26 percent, an acceleration from previous quarters. Comparable sales in high-margin ""signature"" categories such as baby, health and wellness outpaced those overall by three percentage points. ""As we move into the biggest quarter of the year, we are pleased with our inventory position,"" Cornell said.Target, which has been investing heavily to improve its supply chain for over a year, said it would be well-stocked during the holiday season even though it will keep its overall inventory base lower than last year. The retailer also stress-tested its website with a promotion during the third quarter and said it was prepared to handle the surge in online orders. Last year, the website crashed briefly during Cyber Monday, the biggest U.S. online shopping day, which falls right after the Thanksgiving weekend.  Target forecast fiscal-year earnings of $5.10 to $5.30 per share, excluding special items, up from a prior outlook of $4.80 to $5.20. It also raised the forecast for its sales performance at stores open at least a year by one percentage point to a range of down 1 percent to up 1 percent for this quarter.Net income attributable to Target rose nearly 11 percent to $608 million in the third quarter from a year earlier.Earnings of $1.04 per share before special items beat the analysts' average estimate of 83 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Total sales fell 6.7 percent to $16.4 billion. Same-store sales dipped 0.2 percent, while analysts on average had expected a decline 1.1 percent, according to research firm Consensus Metrix.

Pilots went on strike because ABX, owned by Air Transport Services Group Inc, has violated its contract by asking them to work emergency hours over the last two years because of a staffing shortage, then failed to grant them compensatory time off or allow pilots to take earned vacations, the union said.  ""Our pilots are striking so that we can have the status quo of our contract restored, and we would like that to be in the next minute so we can return to serving our customers,"" said Tim Jewell, a pilot and secretary treasurer of Teamsters Local 1224, which represents ABX pilots. ""But if the company chooses not to do that our members are prepared to continue striking.""Air Transport Services Group said in a statement that ABX was taking multiple steps to tackle an ""illegal work stoppage"" including seeking a court order to get pilots back to work.  ""We expect the court will uphold our position that the actions taken by the union to refuse work assignments is not legal, and the issues involved constitute a minor dispute to be resolved via arbitration under terms of our current labor agreements,"" ABX Air President John Starkovich said in a statement. The strike comes just ahead of Cyber Monday, which is the biggest day of the year for internet shopping and is expected to break records this year.Amazon has contracts with the major U.S. package delivery companies United Parcel Service Inc and FedEx Corp, giving it alternatives to ABX. In May, Amazon also entered into a long-term agreement with Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings Inc under which the company would provide cargo services to the online retailer using 20 Boeing Co 767-300 freighters. ""We work with a variety of carriers and are confident in our ability to serve customers,"" Amazon spokeswoman Kelly Cheeseman said.DHL, however, said the strike had affected deliveries of goods into the United States.

""We are continuing to monitor the situation."" Matt Barton, an aviation industry economist with FlightPath Economics, said he expects the strike will be short, so will only cause a ""relatively minor shortage"" for Amazon.

1358,"  WASHINGTON A Republican antitrust veteran has been named on Monday to U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's transition team for the Justice Department, a choice that lawyers say signals a more hands-off approach to antitrust enforcement compared to Democratic President Barack Obama.David Higbee, a partner at the law firm Hunton & Williams LLP, worked for President George W. Bush's administration from 2001 to 2005, spending the last year in the Antitrust Division. Since then he has advised clients on merger reviews, antitrust litigation and government investigations. Higbee joins Joshua Wright, an economist and former commissioner at the Federal Trade Commission, as the only two people on Trump's transition team with a background in antitrust.The Obama administration has challenged an unusually large number of mergers in the last few years, leading to the collapse of Halliburton Co's plan to buy Baker Hughes Inc, among others. Currently, the Justice Department is suing Anthem Inc to prevent it from buying Cigna Corp and Aetna Inc to stop its purchase of Humana Inc. While Trump, who campaigned as a populist, has talked tough on media mergers such as AT&T Inc buying Time Warner Inc, and singled out Amazon.com Inc for antitrust scrutiny, Higbee's naming heralds a return to a traditional Republican view of merger enforcement, lawyers said. ""Higbee will have that sensible caution,"" said Bruce McDonald, another veteran of the Bush administration now at the law firm Jones Day. ""He will be more confident in business and markets and less confident that government can identify and fix problems.""An antitrust division designed by Higbee would be tough on price-fixing and mergers of competitors but would be cautious in challenging deals where companies buy suppliers or incidents where companies are accused of breaking antitrust law to run competitors out of business, McDonald said.

1359,"   By Narottam Medhora and Jeffrey Dastin  Amazon.com Inc said on Monday it has opened a brick-and-mortar grocery store in Seattle without lines or checkout counters, kicking off new competition with supermarket chains.Amazon Go, the online shopping company's new 1,800-square-foot (167-square-meter) store, uses sensors to detect what items shoppers have picked off the shelves and sends a bill to their Amazon accounts if they do not replace them. The store marks Amazon's latest push into groceries, one of the biggest retail categories it has yet to master. The company currently delivers produce and groceries to homes through its AmazonFresh service.""It’s a great recognition that their e-commerce model doesn’t work for every product,"" said analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research, noting that physical stores would complement AmazonFresh.""If there were hundreds of these stores around the country, it would be a huge threat"" to supermarket chains, he said.The S&P 1500 food retail index, which includes Kroger Co, Whole Foods Market Inc and other companies, was down 0.5 percent at the close. Shares of Amazon closed up about 2.6 percent. Amazon Go is available now for employees of the company and is expected to be open to the public early next year, Amazon said.If tests are successful, Amazon plans to open more than 2,000 grocery stores, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday, citing sources. The company is considering other store formats, including one that would let drivers pick up goods at the curbside, the report said.Amazon declined to comment on the report. ""The checkout lines are always the most inefficient parts of the store experience,"" said Neil Saunders, managing director of retail research firm Conlumino. ""Not only would you save a lot on labor costs, you actually would make the process much quicker for consumers and much more satisfying.""Still, the grab-and-go experience would take getting used to, he said.Some people may ""feel like they stole"" an item, Saunders said. Apart from groceries such as bread and milk, the store also offers ready-to-eat meals made fresh by on-site chefs and local kitchens and bakeries, Amazon said.That would make Amazon Go a potential competitor to fast-casual dining chains like Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc as well.Amazon Go is not the first physical store for the e-commerce company to open.It has a book store in Seattle, as well as pop-ups at malls where it displays Amazon devices such as the Kindle.

1360,"   By Jonathan Stempel | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Makers of the Snuggie blanket and other products sold mainly on TV have sued Amazon.com Inc, accusing the internet retailer of trademark infringement for letting an ""astronomical"" number of counterfeit products to be sold through its website.The lawsuit was filed on Monday night by Allstar Marketing Group LLC, Ideavillage Products Corp and Ontel Products Corp, which respectively sell such products as the Snuggie, Copper Fit compression sleeves and Magic Tracks toy racetracks through so-called ""As Seen on TV"" advertising.It was filed three weeks after Seattle-based Amazon filed two of its own lawsuits in a Washington state court, targeting vendors it said were selling counterfeit goods on its website.Amazon spokesman Erik Fairleigh declined to comment on Tuesday, citing the pending litigation.Allstar, Ideavillage and Ontel said they have lost profits because Amazon has let its product display pages be ""hijacked"" by counterfeiters, which offer impossibly low prices and confuse consumers into thinking their products are the real thing. The plaintiffs said counterfeiters from China, Japan, Thailand and other countries are taking a ""free ride"" on their reputation and goodwill, while many consumers leave bad reviews about fake products on the hijacked pages.""Amazon has taken no action to prevent the sale of such counterfeit products despite having the knowledge, opportunity and means to do so,"" the plaintiffs said.The lawsuit also accuses Amazon of copyright infringement, and violating New York state false advertising and unfair competition laws. It seeks to recoup unspecified sums in the millions of dollars, including lost profits and punitive damages. The plaintiff's lawyer did not immediately respond to requests for additional comment.Allstar is based in Hawthorne, New York; Ideavillage in Wayne, New Jersey and Ontel in Fairfield, New Jersey.Amazon's anti-counterfeiting policy says that ""customers trust that they can always buy with confidence on Amazon.com,"" and that counterfeiters can have their selling privileges revoked and inventory destroyed without reimbursement. The lawsuits filed by Amazon on Nov. 14 in the Superior Court in King County, Washington targeted makers of what it called fake versions of Forearm Forklift straps, which help people lift heavy items, and TRX exercise products.In July, the German shoemaker Birkenstock Orthopadie GmbH decided to stop selling on Amazon because of counterfeiters.The case is Allstar Marketing Group LLC et al v Amazon.com Inc, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 16-09376.
