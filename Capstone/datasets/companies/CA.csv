3,"   By Abhirup Roy and Supantha Mukherjee  Business software maker CA Inc, trying to shake off sluggish sales growth, is digging into a sizeable war chest built over the years to propel growth through acquisitions and a renewed focus on its own products.CA may spend more than the $300 million to $500 million it earmarked for acquisitions in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2015 to bolster its cloud and security operations, Chief Executive Michael Gregoire told Reuters in an interview.""We have $3.3 billion in cash. We have a lot of flexibility to do a variety of acquisitions,"" Gregoire said, adding that he prefers doing small deals.He said CA will also invest more on developing its home-grown products, a number of which are expected to be launched by November.CA, which also makes cloud software, is keen to reclaim its status as a high-growth company, following its struggle in recent years to cope with competition from bigger rivals such as IBM Corp, Oracle Corp and VMware Inc.""If they make the right acquisition that can really go a long way towards moving the top line in the right direction,"" FBR Capital Markets analyst Daniel Ives said.Revenue declined 2.1 percent to $4.5 billion in fiscal 2014. In the previous six years, revenue has varied little, ranging between $4.14 billion and $4.78 billion. CA's new plans tie in with a restructuring launched in May last year by Gregoire, four months after he took over the top job when William McCracken retired.The plan includes selling non-core assets such as its Arcserve data protection business and cutting 1,800 jobs.In their place, CA hired about 1,000 people with specific cloud specialty skills, said Gregoire, an avid competitive cyclist. Before Gregoire took over, the company spent nearly $1 billion in three years to buy software companies such as Nimsoft, Arcot and Interactive TKO to beef up its cloud business.Gregoire believes CA lost its edge in building unique products and spent too much on buying companies that had no earnings.""So, one of the things that I have been very explicit about is that we have to be great software engineers,"" he said.Under Gregoire, CA has made at least two acquisitions, including the $155 million purchase of Layer 7 Technologies.  Gregoire's preferred strategy involves investing in building products around data security, cloud management and DevOps, with particular focus around the mobile ecosystem.DevOps is a software development method to increase collaboration between software developers and IT operations to release products faster.""They have challenges ahead, that's clear, but you feel like they are starting to move this in the right direction,"" Ives said.CA's shares ended Tuesday at $28.47, about two-thirds lower than their record high of $79.44 in January 2000. IBM and Oracle have gained roughly 60 percent and 46 percent, respectively, in the same period.

4,"   By Robin Respaut | SANTA CLARA, Ca.  SANTA CLARA, Ca. Feb 24 Hillary Clinton lamented the pay gap between men and women to a crowd of female technology executives on Tuesday, in a speech that showed she may make gender inequality a main theme in her likely 2016 presidential bid.It was the first of three speeches the former U.S. secretary of state plans to give to predominantly female audiences in the coming weeks, ahead of her presumed but officially undeclared second attempt to run for president. She is the favorite to win the Democratic nomination by a large margin.With repeated references to breaking ""glass ceilings"", Clinton noted that less than a quarter of software developers are women, and partly blamed technology companies for fostering a loutish culture.""It's been almost a Wild West environment,"" she said of Silicon Valley's boom in recent decades. ""I think a lot of women find that distasteful, to be in a situation sort of resembling a locker-room."" She was warmly received by thousands of women and a smattering of men at a convention center in the heart of Silicon Valley, where women commandeered many of the men's bathrooms during the course of the day.Teams from Oracle Corp, Ericsson and Intel Corp were among those in attendance. They laughed knowingly as Clinton made her practiced non-committal noises about whether she will run. Although she did not drift from previous positions, it seemed clear she hoped to emphasize her interest in gender inequality.In her unsuccessful run for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2008, Clinton's campaign tended to downplay her gender and the historic nature of the prospect of a woman being elected president for the first time. She now appears to have fewer qualms, and has recently relished describing herself as a grandmother.Next month, Clinton is due to speak at the annual conference of Emily's List, the political action committee that helps to elect women who support abortion rights. Later in March, she addresses the Toner Prize award ceremony, named for the late Robin Toner, the first woman to become a New York Times national political correspondent.Taking questions after her speech, she criticized the National Security Agency, which a whistleblower revealed was secretly gathering data on millions of Americans, as not transparent enough.""People felt betrayed,"" she said. ""You didn't tell us you were doing this and now we're reading this on the front page.""

5,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, May 27 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings believes the ratings for CA, Inc. (CA),  including the 'BBB+' long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR), are unaffected by  the proposed acquisition of Rally Software Development Corp. (Rally).  Total rated debt was approximately $2.3 billion including CA's undrawn $1  billion revolving credit facility (RCF). A full list of current ratings follows  at the end of this release. CA announced it entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Rally, a platform  software provider for software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications development, for  $480 million, net of cash.  CA will fund the transaction with available cash, which was $2.8 billion as of  March 31, 2015, and free cash flow (FCF), which Fitch expects will exceed $400  million in fiscal 2016. The acquisition is expected to close in the second  quarter of CA's fiscal 2016, pending shareholder and regulatory approval. Fitch believes Rally will strengthen CA's SaaS capabilities through the addition  of a rapidly growing App Dev platform business and valuable software engineering  resources. The acquisition also provides revenue synergies from leveraging CA's  global salesforce and partner networks. The Rally acquisition will add roughly $87.5 million of revenues but dilute CA's  profitability. Nonetheless, Fitch expects double-digit revenue growth for this  business, and the aforementioned cross-selling opportunities will drive  profitability closer to CA's corporate-wide operating EBITDA margin, which Fitch  estimates will be 40% for fiscal 2016. KEY RATINGS DRIVERS CA's ratings and Outlook reflect: --Strong share position in mainframe and addressable security software markets,  both of which benefit from high customer switching costs.  --Significant recurring revenue from software subscriptions and maintenance (84%  of total revenue).  --Solid liquidity as of March 31, 2015 supported by (i) $2.8 billion of cash  (69% offshore); (ii) $1 billion undrawn RCF expiring June 7, 2019; (iii) strong  and consistent FCF, primarily due to highly profitable recurring mainframe  software maintenance revenue. Fitch expects CA's annual FCF (post-dividends) to  exceed $400 million from fiscal 2016 - fiscal 2018.  --Pro forma for the acquisition, Fitch estimates total leverage (total  debt-to-operating EBITDA) will be unchanged. Fitch expects CA will maintain  total leverage below 1.5x over the intermediate term. --Conservative financial policies. CA continues to maintain solid credit  protection measures for the rating, with total leverage (total debt-to-operating  EBITDA) below 1x in fiscal 2015. Fitch expects total leverage to remain below  1.5x and operating EBITDA-to-gross interest expense to exceed 10x.  Ratings concerns center on:  --Vast majority of operating profit continues to be derived from the Mainframe  Solutions (MS) segment, which is expected to experience flat to modestly  declining revenues through 2018. MS represents approximately 56% of total  revenue but 89% of total segment operating profit because of the significant  profit margin differential compared with Enterprise Solutions (ES).  An unexpected significant decline in customer mainframe usage would have a  material adverse effect on CA's credit ratings in the absence of a significant  improvement in ES. --Weaker than expected revenue growth in ES. In fiscal 2015, ES declined 1% in  constant currency primarily due to weak sales execution and the timing of  renewals. ES has a lower operating margin profile (11% in fiscal 2015) than MS  (approximately 59%), but presents long-term revenue growth opportunities to  offset declines in CA's legacy mainframe business.  --Meaningfully larger competitors with superior financial flexibility. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case for the issuer include: --Revenue growth in constant currency flat to slightly negative over the  intermediate term. --Domestic cash used to fund the Rally acquisition for approximately $480  million, net of cash acquired. --Total leverage to remain below 1.5x and operating EBITDA-to-gross interest  expense to exceed 10x. --Annual FCF expected to exceed $400 million. --Continued acquisition activity will shift revenue mix away from declining  legacy mainframe business. RATINGS SENSITIVITIES  Negative rating actions could occur if: (i) revenues materially contract over a  sustained period, signaling a faster than anticipated decline in the mainframe  market that is not offset by ES, or (ii) operating profit margin declines,  likely from a failure to adequately scale down mainframe-related costs. Positive rating actions are unlikely in the intermediate term in the absence of  meaningfully stronger contribution from ES that results in a more balanced  revenue mix. Fitch expects annual FCF of more than $400 million through 2018, driven by solid  MS operating profitability and high maintenance renewal rates. Fitch anticipates  CA will use FCF to fund small technology-focused acquisitions and share  repurchases, which were nearly $500 million in FY 2015.  Total debt at March 31, 2015 was approximately $1.3 billion and primarily  consisted of:  --$250 million of 2.875% senior notes due 2018;  --$750 million of 5.375% senior notes due 2019;  --$250 million of 4.5% senior notes due 2023.  Fitch continues to rate CA's ratings as follows:  --Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'BBB+'; --Senior unsecured revolving credit facility (RCF) 'BBB+'; --Senior unsecured notes 'BBB+'.

8,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, June 26 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the ratings of CA, Inc.  (CA) at 'BBB+', including the long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR). The Rating  Outlook is Stable.  Fitch's actions affect approximately $2.3 billion of total debt, including CA's  undrawn $1 billion revolving credit facility (RCF). A full list of ratings  follows at the end of this press release. Overall, the ratings and Outlook reflect CA's strong competitive position and  leading market share within the mainframe market.  The company's operating  profile benefits from the relative stability, recurring revenue, high operating  margin and free cash flow (FCF - defined as cash flow from operations less  capital expenditures and dividends) characteristics attributable to its  Mainframe Solutions (MS) business. Fitch believes the MS business will continue  generating the majority of CA's FCF over the ratings horizon.   CA's MS segment revenues declined 2% during fiscal year 2015 (after adjusting  for discontinued operations and currency). Fitch expects that MS segment revenue  growth will remain flat to slightly negative (constant currency) during the  intermediate term. An accelerated deterioration in the mainframe market is  unlikely because most large enterprises are reluctant to switch their  mission-critical operations from the mainframe environment to distributed or  cloud-based alternatives due to high switching costs and the desired reliability  of the mainframe environment for mission-critical operations.    CA's Enterprise Solutions (ES) segment continues to shift its revenue mix and  strategic focus to higher growth products and services including management  cloud, DevOps and security while rationalizing its legacy ES businesses.  Fitch  believes these growth markets will drive positive ES segment revenue growth by  fiscal year 2017.  These growth areas are more competitive and less profitable  than CA's mainframe business which increases the risk that current FCF levels  may not be maintained over the long term without sustained and profitable ES  growth.  However, Fitch is concerned that competition, pricing pressure and  economic sensitivity may hamper expected revenue growth and fail to offset the  gradual but long-term decline in the mainframe market leading to a weaker  operating and credit profile.   KEY RATING DRIVERS CA's ratings and Outlook reflect: --Strong share position in mainframe and addressable security software markets,  both of which benefit from high customer switching costs.  --Significant recurring revenue from software subscriptions and maintenance (84%  of total revenue).  --Pro forma for the Rally acquisition, Fitch estimates total leverage (total  debt-to-operating EBITDA) will be unchanged, and that CA will maintain total  leverage below 1.5x over the intermediate term. --CA continues to maintain conservative financial policies and strong credit  protection measures for the rating, with total leverage (total debt-to-operating  EBITDA) below 1x in fiscal 2015. Fitch expects total leverage to remain below  1.5x and operating EBITDA-to-gross interest expense to exceed 10x.  Ratings concerns center on:  --Vast majority of operating profit continues to be derived from the MS segment,  which is expected to experience flat to modestly declining revenues through  2018. MS represents approximately 56% of total revenue but 89% of total segment  operating profit because of the significant profit margin differential compared  with ES.  An unexpected significant decline in customer mainframe usage would have a  material adverse effect on CA's credit ratings in the absence of a significant  improvement in ES. --Weaker than expected revenue growth in ES. In fiscal 2015, ES declined 1%  (constant currency) primarily due to weak sales execution and the timing of  renewals. ES has a lower operating margin profile (11% in fiscal 2015) than MS  (approximately 59%), but presents long-term revenue growth opportunities to  offset declines in CA's legacy mainframe business.  --Meaningfully larger competitors with superior financial flexibility. KEY ASSUMPTIONS --Revenue growth in constant currency flat to slightly negative over the  intermediate term. --Domestic cash used to fund the Rally acquisition for approximately $480  million, net of cash acquired. --Total leverage to remain below 1.5x and operating EBITDA-to-gross interest  expense to exceed 10x. --Annual FCF expected to exceed $400 million (post-dividend). --Continued acquisition activity shift revenue mix away from declining legacy  mainframe business. RATING SENSITIVITIES Negative rating actions would likely coincide with the adoption of a more  aggressive capital allocation policy that increases total debt-to-EBITDA beyond  2x on a sustained basis or event-driven merger and acquisition activity that  drives leverage above 2x in the absence of a creditable de-leveraging plan.  Additionally, negative rating actions can stem from Fitch's expectation that  CA's ES segment will not generate organic revenue growth during the ratings  horizon indicating that the company's operating strategies have not captured  sufficient traction to offset ongoing revenue declines within its legacy  products and services.   Positive rating actions are unlikely in the intermediate term in the absence of  meaningfully stronger contribution from ES that results in a more balanced  revenue mix. LIQUIDITY AND DEBT STRUCTURE CA's liquidity position is solid and supported by $2.8 billion of cash on hand  as of March 31, 2015 (69% offshore) and a $1 billion undrawn revolving credit  facility set to expire on June 7, 2019.  In addition, expected FCF generation,  primarily due to the highly profitable and recurring mainframe software  maintenance revenue, adds to the company's overall financial flexibility.  Fitch  expects CA's annual FCF to exceed $400 million (post-dividend) from fiscal 2016  to fiscal 2018.  Total debt at March 31, 2015 was approximately $1.3 billion and primarily  consisted of:  --$250 million of 2.875% senior notes due 2018;  --$750 million of 5.375% senior notes due 2019;  --$250 million of 4.5% senior notes due 2023.

10,"  * Long-term instability could damage budget, C/A deficit -finmin* Strong govt needed to meet 5 pct inflation target -finmin   (Adds markets, details)By Ebru TuncayISTANBUL, Sept 9 Political instability poses the biggest risk to Turkey's economy, Finance Minister Mehmet Simsek said on Wednesday, citing potential damage to public finances and further pressure on budget and current account deficits.Simsek's comments are a rare admission by the governing AK Party, which unexpectedly lost its parliamentary majority in June elections, that politics could further hamper Turkey's once-stunning growth.The lira currency has hit a series of record lows this year as the election result and an upsurge in violence between Kurdish militants and security forces since July have unsettled investors. ""The most important risk to the Turkish economy is long-term political uncertainty,"" Simsek said at a conference in Istanbul. ""It would be a recipe for budget and current account deficits.""He said the economy is likely to grow by 3 percent in 2015 but warned that prolonged political uncertainty could weaken strong public finances, which currently act as a buffer against economic shocks. Simsek also said achieving a 5 percent inflation target could only happen with a strong government, not through central bank intervention alone.Turks will vote again on Nov. 1 although polls suggest the AK Party will again struggle to win enough votes to form a single-party government and may be forced back to the negotiating table to try to strike a coalition deal.Turkey's new deputy prime minister in charge of the economy, Cevdet Yilmaz, said on Tuesday that the political uncertainty which has hammered the lira would ease after the November poll. The central bank, whose independence has been brought into question by President Tayyip Erdogan's repeated assertions that it should lower interest rates, has been contending with stubborn inflation coupled with flagging growth.In August inflation exceeded expectations and climbed back above 7 percent, with further increases expected as the weaker lira feeds through to prices.The lira stood at 3.0055 against the dollar at 0840 GMT, firming slightly from 3.0163 late on Tuesday.The main BIST 100 share index rose 0.70 percent to 72,545.36. The benchmark 10-year government bond yield  stood at 10.71 percent down from 10.74 percent.
