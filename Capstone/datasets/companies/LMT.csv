0,"  Jan 16 The office of the secretary of defense (OSD) has directed the U.S. Navy to cut its overall buy of the littoral combat ships to 32 ships, foregoing 20 more of the small, fast warships, the Navy Times reported, citing Pentagon sources.The decision, in a Jan. 6 memo from acting deputy secretary of defense Christine Fox, follows the final 2015 budget guidance from the White House, the newspaper reported on Wednesday. ()""The defense department is not going to discuss a budget that has yet to be presented or decisions that haven't been made,"" Pentagon spokesman Carl Woog told Reuters.The Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) program, one of the Pentagon's biggest acquisition programs, includes ships built by Lockheed Martin Corp and Australia's Austal Ltd . The 52-ship program had come under scrutiny after a spate of technical glitches.However, supporters of the program have argued that the smaller ships, which require less personnel, offered the Navy the best way to increase the size of its fleet, which is now at historic lows. ""Secretary (Chuck) Hagel has long said he is going to have to make tough choices,"" said a senior defense official.""There may yet be alternatives to cutting the LCS program that Secretary Hagel could consider."" It is believed that the OSD's initial guidance in January was to cut the program even further, the Navy Times said.Navy Secretary Ray Mabus, a strident defender of the LCS program, personally argued to restore at least a portion of the future ship buy, the newspaper reported.One Navy source said that the decision to end LCS at 32 ships isn't yet a done deal, the Navy Times reported.",2014-01-16,LMT,"Thu Jan 16, 2014 | 1:00am EST",Pentagon cuts littoral combat ships buy to 32: Navy Times,http://www.reuters.com//article/defense-littoral-idUSL3N0KQ1UQ20140116?type=companyNews
1,"   By Andrea Shalal-Esa | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Jan 22 Lockheed Martin Corp's  estimate that its F-35 fighter plane program supports 125,000 jobs in the United States is ""greatly exaggerated"" and the real amount may be half that number, according to a new think tank report issued Wednesday.William Hartung, a longtime critic of the $392 billion F-35 program, argues in the report issued by the nonprofit Center for International Policy that Lockheed is overstating the number of F-35-related jobs to shore up support for the program.The report could provide fresh fodder for backers of Boeing Co, which is hoping to sell the U.S. Navy more of its F/A-18 fighter jets, and other critics of the F-35 program.Hartung said Lockheed and three other big F-35 suppliers also made campaign contributions totalling $11.1 million to key lawmakers that oversee funding for the newest U.S. warplane. As the Pentagon's single largest weapons program, the F-35 is a frequent target in military budget cut drills. But top U.S. officials have said current funding levels are important to preserve economies of scale aimed at lowering the plane's cost over time.""The claims about the F-35 as a job generator are an argument of last resort for a program that has been plagued by cost overruns, performance problems, and questions about how many are needed,"" wrote Hartung, author of a 2010 book critical of Lockheed.He said it was important to understand the true impact of the weapons program so Congress could ""debate the future of the F-35 based on its strategic merits, not pork barrel politics."" Hartung's report said standard estimating procedures used by other studies would put the number of jobs closer to 50,000 to 60,000.Lockheed, the Pentagon's No. 1 supplier, defended its estimate, which is based on 32,500 direct jobs and adds 92,500 indirect jobs. The company said it expected the number of jobs would grow as production increased. ""We calculate the jobs impact for our programs using methods accepted by industry and leading economists,"" said Lockheed spokesman Michael Rein. He said Lockheed's jobs multiplier was similar to the one used by Boeing, the No. 2 supplier to the U.S. Defense Department.Hartung also challenged Lockheed's claim of significant F-35 work being done in 46 states. He said two states - Texas and California - accounted for over half the jobs on the program, and the top five states, which include Florida, Connecticut and New Hampshire, accounted for 70 percent of the jobs.Lockheed is building the F-35 for the U.S. military and eight countries that helped fund its development: Britain, Australia, Canada, Denmark, Norway, Turkey, Italy and the Netherlands. Israel and Japan have also ordered the jets.Companies in participating countries compete for work building components of the jet. In addition, Italy and Japan are building large plants where F-35 jets will be assembled.",2014-01-22,LMT,"Wed Jan 22, 2014 | 6:00am EST",Lockheed overstates F-35 jobs: think tank,http://www.reuters.com//article/lockheed-fighter-jobs-idUSL2N0KW02P20140122?type=companyNews
2,"   By Andrea Shalal-Esa | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N), maker of F-35 fighter jets, satellites and warships, on Thursday forecast higher earnings in 2014 after charges linked to U.S. defense budget cuts and workforce reductions depressed earnings in the fourth quarter.Lockheed Chief Financial Officer Bruce Tanner told reporters 2014 would likely mark a ""trough"" in U.S. military spending, with recent budget agreements paving the way for a more stable outlook going forward.He said congressionally mandated budget cuts in 2013 may have a lingering effect on revenues, projected to be flat to slightly lower in 2014, but a recent congressional budget deal meant U.S. defense spending would edge up in coming years.""We're hopeful that 2014 is kind of the bottoming out if you just take a look at the recently signed budget agreement,"" Tanner said.Lockheed's higher earnings forecast reflected a swing to expected income from its pension accounts after years of payments that had lowered earnings, he said.Chief Executive Marillyn Hewson told reporters Lockheed remained focused on becoming a ""stronger, leaner, healthier company,"" by cutting costs, improving operational efficiencies, investing in innovations, and boosting international orders.Foreign orders accounted for 23 percent of orders received and 17 percent of sales in 2013, with revenues set to grow a ""little under 20 percent"" in 2014, Tanner said.Lockheed shares fell 1.7 percent to $154.02 in lower overall market trading on the New York Stock Exchange.Joe Nadol at JP Morgan said Lockheed's results might prove ""a bit of a disappointment"" to investors since the company had consistently exceeded expectations in recent quarters. Lockheed reported its fourth quarter net earnings from continuing operations fell 14.2 percent to $488 million, or $1.50 per share, from $569 million, or $1.73 per share, a year earlier. Revenues dropped to $11.5 billion from $12.1 billion.It said its fourth-quarter earnings included a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $195 million linked to U.S. defense spending cuts that reduced earnings by $176 million.It also included severance charges of $171 million that cut earnings by $111 million. The two items combined reduced earnings per share by $0.88, the company said.It said it did not expect similar goodwill charges for other reporting units in the near term. Net earnings also included pension adjustments, although at a lower level than seen in the year-earlier period.RECORD BACKLOG Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S had forecast net quarterly earnings from continuing operations of $668.5 million or $2.02 per share on revenues of $11.34 billion.Excluding the goodwill charge, Lockheed's earnings per share totaled $2.04, beating the consensus forecast of $1.95, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Rob Stallard, analyst with RBC Capital Markets, said an unexpected goodwill charge and higher tax rate kept results below his expectations, but Lockheed continued to benefit from aggressive cost-cutting measures adopted in recent years. Lockheed, the Pentagon's No. 1 supplier, said full-year earnings from continuing operations rose to $3.0 billion, or $9.04 per share, up from $2.7 billion, or $8.36 per share, in 2012.Revenues fell to $45.4 billion in 2013 from $47.2 billion in 2012.It said it expected slightly lower to flat revenues of $44 billion to $45.5 billion in 2014, but earnings per share were likely to rise to $10.25 to $10.55.Lockheed's Hewson said the company reached a record backlog of $82.6 billion in 2013.

4,"   By Andrea Shalal-Esa | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON A new U.S. Defense Department report warns that ongoing software, maintenance and reliability problems with Lockheed Martin Corp's F-35 stealth fighter could delay the Marine Corps' plans to start using its F-35 jets by mid-2015.The latest report by the Pentagon's chief weapons tester, Michael Gilmore, provides a detailed critique of the F-35's technical challenges, and focuses heavily on what it calls the ""unacceptable"" performance of the plane's software, according to a 25-page draft obtained by Reuters.The report forecast a possible 13-month delay in completing testing of the Block 2B software needed for the Marine Corps to clear the jets for initial combat use next year, a priority given the high cost of maintaining current aging warplanes.Gilmore, director of operational test and evaluation for the U.S. Defense Department, has long been critical of the $392 billion F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, the Pentagon's costliest weapons program, and the latest report is no exception.The report, due to be sent to Congress this week, said the aircraft is proving less reliable and harder to maintain than expected, and remains vulnerable to propellant fires sparked by missile strikes.Air Force Lieutenant General Chris Bogdan, the Pentagon's F-35 program chief, said in a statement to Reuters that Gilmore's report was factually accurate but did not reflect concerted efforts under way by his office and industry to address software, reliability and maintenance issues.""The basic design of the F-35 is sound, and test results underscore our confidence in the ultimate performance that the United States and its international partners and allies value so highly,"" Bogdan said. ""Of course, we recognize risks still exist in the program, but they are understood and manageable.""Bogdan said he remained confident that the F-35's initial combat capability would be ready in time for the U.S. Marine Corps next year, and cited a series of successful weapons tests done late last year. He said the program was about halfway through developmental testing after completing 1,153 flights and accomplishing more than 9,000 test objectives in 2013.Lockheed is developing the F-35 for the Marines, Air Force and Navy, and eight countries that helped fund its development: Britain, Canada, Australia, Norway, Italy, Turkey, Denmark and the Netherlands. Israel and Japan have also ordered the jet. The program, which began in 2001, is 70 percent over initial cost estimates, and years behind schedule, but top U.S. officials say it is now making progress. They have vowed to safeguard funding for the program to keep it on track.OTHER CRITIQUES Earlier this week, the nonprofit Center for International Policy said Lockheed had greatly exaggerated its estimate that the F-35 program sustained 125,000 U.S. jobs to shore up support for the program.Both reports could provide fresh fodder for critics of the F-35 program, including backers of Boeing Co, which is hoping to sell the U.S. Navy more of its F/A-18 fighter jets.But Lockheed Chief Executive Marillyn Hewson told reporters on Thursday that she saw continued support for the F-35 from the U.S. government, Congress and foreign allies. ""There's no question ... that we need the F-35. It brings a very important, unique capability for our nation,"" she said.Lockheed spokesman Michael Rein said Gilmore's report confirmed the F-35 was meeting or exceeding flight test goals, and the company would continue to tackle issues as they arose.""The challenges identified are known items and the normal discoveries found in a test program of this size and complexity,"" he said.Gilmore's report acknowledged the F-35's progress in 2013 on flight testing, despite government furloughs and two fleet-wide groundings. But it said the program was still struggling to integrate the plane's ""mission systems,"" or sensors, weapons and other equipment needed for use in military operations. The current software generated too many nuisance warnings and resulted in poor sensor performance. Further work on software had been slowed by testing required to validate earlier fixes, the report said.It said Lockheed had delivered F-35 jets with 50 percent or less of the software capabilities required by its production contracts with the Pentagon.The computer-based logistics system known as ALIS was fielded with ""serious deficiencies"" and remained behind schedule, which affected servicing of existing jets needed for flight testing, the report said. It said the ALIS diagnostic system failed to meet even basic requirements.But the most immediate concern involved the Block 2B version of the software that must be completed in order for the Marines to start using the jets from July 2015.""Initial results with the new increment of Block 2B software indicate deficiencies still exist in fusion, radar, electronic warfare, navigation, electro-optical target system, distributed aperture system, helmet-mounted display system, and datalink,"" the report said, noting the problems could delay efforts to complete Block 2B development and flight test.The report cited projections that the 2B software would not be completed until November 2015, 13 months later than planned. This would delay release to the F-35 fleet until July 2016, a year after the Marines want to start using the jets.It said there is also little margin for any weight growth, and the airplane's increased use of electrical systems makes it vulnerable to lightning and missile strikes.Bogdan said extensive studies had showed the plane's radar-evading capabilities, advanced sensors, ability to fuse data, advanced countermeasures and electronic attack equipment greatly reduced the chance that it would be hit by enemy fire.(Reporting by Andrea Shalal-Esa; Editing by Doina Chiacu and David Gregorio)",2014-01-23,LMT,"Thu Jan 23, 2014 | 3:36pm EST","Exclusive: Pentagon report faults F-35 on software, reliability",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-usa-lockheed-fighter-idUSBREA0M1L920140123?type=companyNews

11,"  WASHINGTON Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) Chief Financial Officer Bruce Tanner said on Thursday he was hopeful that 2014 would mark a ""trough,"" or ""bottoming out,"" in U.S. military spending, with recent budget agreements paving the way for a more stable outlook going forward.Tanner said most of the company's projected increase in earnings per share in 2014 was linked to improved pension impacts due to a higher discount rate and lower liabilities after years of pension payments by the company. He said the company was focused on boosting international sales. Foreign orders accounted for 23 percent of orders received and 17 percent of sales in 2013, with revenues set to grow a ""little under 20 percent"" in 2014, he said.

12,"   By Andrea Shalal-Esa | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON A new U.S. Defense Department report warns that ongoing software, maintenance and reliability problems with Lockheed Martin Corp's F-35 stealth fighter could delay the Marine Corps' plans to start using its F-35 jets by mid-2015.The latest report by the Pentagon's chief weapons tester, Michael Gilmore, provides a detailed critique of the F-35's technical challenges, and focuses heavily on what it calls the ""unacceptable"" performance of the plane's software, according to a 25-page draft obtained by Reuters.The report forecast a possible 13-month delay in completing testing of the Block 2B software needed for the Marine Corps to clear the jets for initial combat use next year, a priority given the high cost of maintaining current aging warplanes.Gilmore, director of operational test and evaluation for the U.S. Defense Department, has long been critical of the $392 billion F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, the Pentagon's costliest weapons program, and the latest report is no exception.The report, due to be sent to Congress this week, said the aircraft is proving less reliable and harder to maintain than expected, and remains vulnerable to propellant fires sparked by missile strikes.Air Force Lieutenant General Chris Bogdan, the Pentagon's F-35 program chief, said in a statement to Reuters that Gilmore's report was factually accurate but did not reflect concerted efforts under way by his office and industry to address software, reliability and maintenance issues.""The basic design of the F-35 is sound, and test results underscore our confidence in the ultimate performance that the United States and its international partners and allies value so highly,"" Bogdan said. ""Of course, we recognize risks still exist in the program, but they are understood and manageable.""Bogdan said he remained confident that the F-35's initial combat capability would be ready in time for the U.S. Marine Corps next year, and cited a series of successful weapons tests done late last year. He said the program was about halfway through developmental testing after completing 1,153 flights and accomplishing more than 9,000 test objectives in 2013.Lockheed is developing the F-35 for the Marines, Air Force and Navy, and eight countries that helped fund its development: Britain, Canada, Australia, Norway, Italy, Turkey, Denmark and the Netherlands. Israel and Japan have also ordered the jet.An official at South Korea's arms procurement agency, the Defense Acquisition Program Administration said any delays beyond an intended 2018 delivery date would be ""problematic"". Seoul has said it would buy 40 of the F-35s, though still has to finalize this order A senior Japan Defense Ministry official said: ""We can do nothing but ask the JPO (Joint Program Office) to speed up the program."" Tokyo plans to buy 42 of the stealth fighters, with the first four due for delivery by March 2017.The Australian Defence Force declined to comment. Australia is one of the largest international buyers with plans for up to 100 F-35s.The F-35 program, which began in 2001, is 70 percent over initial cost estimates, and years behind schedule, but top U.S. officials say it is now making progress. They have vowed to safeguard funding for the program to keep it on track.OTHER CRITIQUES Earlier this week, the nonprofit Center for International Policy said Lockheed had greatly exaggerated its estimate that the F-35 program sustained 125,000 U.S. jobs to shore up support for the program. Both reports could provide fresh fodder for critics of the F-35 program, including backers of Boeing Co, which is hoping to sell the U.S. Navy more of its F/A-18 fighter jets.But Lockheed Chief Executive Marillyn Hewson told reporters on Thursday that she saw continued support for the F-35 from the U.S. government, Congress and foreign allies.""There's no question ... that we need the F-35. It brings a very important, unique capability for our nation,"" she said.Lockheed spokesman Michael Rein said Gilmore's report confirmed the F-35 was meeting or exceeding flight test goals, and the company would continue to tackle issues as they arose.""The challenges identified are known items and the normal discoveries found in a test program of this size and complexity,"" he said. Gilmore's report acknowledged the F-35's progress in 2013 on flight testing, despite government furloughs and two fleet-wide groundings. But it said the program was still struggling to integrate the plane's ""mission systems,"" or sensors, weapons and other equipment needed for use in military operations.The current software generated too many nuisance warnings and resulted in poor sensor performance. Further work on software had been slowed by testing required to validate earlier fixes, the report said.It said Lockheed had delivered F-35 jets with 50 percent or less of the software capabilities required by its production contracts with the Pentagon.The computer-based logistics system known as ALIS was fielded with ""serious deficiencies"" and remained behind schedule, which affected servicing of existing jets needed for flight testing, the report said. It said the ALIS diagnostic system failed to meet even basic requirements.But the most immediate concern involved the Block 2B version of the software that must be completed in order for the Marines to start using the jets from July 2015.""Initial results with the new increment of Block 2B software indicate deficiencies still exist in fusion, radar, electronic warfare, navigation, electro-optical target system, distributed aperture system, helmet-mounted display system, and datalink,"" the report said, noting the problems could delay efforts to complete Block 2B development and flight test.The report cited projections that the 2B software would not be completed until November 2015, 13 months later than planned. This would delay release to the F-35 fleet until July 2016, a year after the Marines want to start using the jets.It said there is also little margin for any weight growth, and the airplane's increased use of electrical systems makes it vulnerable to lightning and missile strikes.Bogdan said extensive studies had showed the plane's radar-evading capabilities, advanced sensors, ability to fuse data, advanced countermeasures and electronic attack equipment greatly reduced the chance that it would be hit by enemy fire.(Reporting by Andrea Shalal-Esa; Editing by Doina Chiacu and David Gregorio)",2014-01-24,LMT,"Fri Jan 24, 2014 | 5:05am EST","Exclusive: Pentagon report faults F-35 on software, reliability",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-lockheed-fighter-exclusive-idUSBREA0N0ID20140124?type=companyNews

18,"  By Missy RyanWASHINGTON Jan 27 The Obama administration notified Congress on Monday of plans to sell 24 Apache attack helicopters to Iraq, part of an effort to bolster the military against al Qaeda-linked militants, after addressing lawmakers' concerns that held up the sale for months.The Defense Security Cooperation Agency said on its website it had informed Congress of the possible sale of the Boeing Co-built helicopters to the government of Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, who is in a standoff with Islamist militants in the western province of Anbar two years after the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq.The administration also notified Congress of plans to lease Iraq up to six Apaches, which a U.S. defense official said would be used for training purposes until the purchased Apaches were delivered. The cost of the purchased Apaches, and the equipment and support that accompanies them, is worth about $4.8 billion, the Defense Security Cooperation Agency said.On Sunday, Iraqi forces intensified air strikes and artillery fire on the city of Falluja. The conflict in Anbar has focused Washington's attention in Iraq as fears grow about spillover from the war in neighboring Syria. The Obama administration is also seeking to expedite delivery of fighter jets, missiles, surveillance drones and other weaponry to Iraq.But the Apache sale was held up for months by concerns from lawmakers about how the helicopters would be used.Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey, a Democrat who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, withheld support for those plans because of concerns about how Washington could ensure that security forces under Maliki, a Shi'ite increasingly at odds with minority Sunnis, use the helicopters prudently. A Senate aide said that the committee had signed off on the lease and sale of the helicopters after the State Department ""engaged with us extensively this month.""""Based upon these discussions, the committee has signed off on the lease and sale of the Apaches,"" the aide said. The Pentagon agency also announced the possible sale of support equipment for the leased Apaches totaling $1.37 billion and including Hellfire missiles and launchers, and pilot night-vision sensors. In addition to Boeing, principal contractors will be Lockheed Martin Corp, General Electric Co and Robertson Fuel Systems.Menendez had also voiced concern about whether officials were keeping Congress sufficiently informed about efforts to ensure Iraq does not permit Iran to carry weapons to Syria across Iraqi airspace.Many in Washington view Maliki with suspicion because of his close ties with Iran and his strained relations with Iraq's minorities. But Maliki has been a U.S. ally on security, and could win a third term in elections in April.Vice President Joe Biden spoke with Maliki on Sunday, and praised steps his government has made to draw Sunni tribesmen into Iraqi security forces.The administration also notified Congress last week of plans to sell 500 Hellfire missiles to Iraq, part of a package of 'replenishment' supplies that Maliki requested this month.",2014-01-28,LMT,"Mon Jan 27, 2014 | 7:17pm EST",UPDATE 2-U.S. moves forward with attack helicopter sale to Iraq,http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-iraq-helicopters-idUSL2N0L11QL20140128?type=companyNews
19,"   By Sarah N. Lynch | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Jan 30 U.S. regulators said Thursday they plan to scrutinize whether asset managers have policies to prevent and detect cyber attacks and are properly safeguarding against security risks that could arise from vendors having access to their systems.""We will be looking to see what policies are in place to prevent, detect and respond to cyber attacks,"" said Jane Jarcho, the national associate director for the Securities and Exchange Commission's investment adviser exam program.""We will be looking at policies on IT training, vendor access and vendor due diligence, and what information you have on any vendors,"" she added, in a presentation to a group of compliance professionals at SEC headquarters in Washington, D.C.The SEC's upcoming 2014 review of cyber security policies at asset managers will be conducted as part of the agency's routine examinations of investment advisers and investment companies, such as mutual funds.Inspections are designed to catch major problems before they bubble up; however, exams can also lead to enforcement action if the SEC uncovers egregious activity or repeat violations.The new details revealed on Thursday about the SEC's focus on asset managers' cyber security policies come in the wake of attacks on several well-known retailers, including Target Corp  and Neiman Marcus.The arts and crafts chain Michaels has also said its network may have been breached, and the FBI has warned retailers to expect more attacks. On Wednesday, Target revealed that the theft of credentials from an undisclosed vendor helped the attackers gain access to about 40 million credit and debit card records and another 70 million customer records.Cyber thieves have been using vendors as a route to go after high-value targets for several years.In 2011, hackers attempted to break into the networks of defense contractor Lockheed Martin Corp after stealing information from EMC Corp's RSA security division that allowed them to duplicate SecurID electronic keys. Last year hackers attacked security software maker Bit9, then used stolen data to forge digital signatures on malicious software so they could launch a second round of attacks on Bit9's customers.The decision by the SEC to focus on cyber issues in its inspections of asset managers pre-dated the Target incident.But since the Target breach was made public in mid-December, some U.S. lawmakers and law enforcement officials have ramped up their focus on the issue and called for Congress to pass legislation that would require retailers and other private businesses to inform government agencies and customers about major breaches.In 2011, in response to another rash of cyber attacks, the SEC drafted some informal staff-level guidance for public companies to use when considering whether to disclose cyber attacks and their impact on a company's financial condition. In addition, most states have laws on the books that require companies to tell customers about breaches, even if they are privately held.However, critics say this disparate regime is harmful for consumers and investors because there is no unifying federal standard for when businesses must report data breaches.In April, when SEC Chair Mary Jo White took over the helm of the agency, U.S. Senate Commerce Committee Chairman Jay Rockefeller asked her to consider releasing more formalized commission-level guidance to help ensure investors get information they need.On the sidelines of Thursday's event, White said she felt the guidance the commission issued in 2011 has been ""helpful in improving disclosures."" However, she added, she plans to ""continuously review"" the issue to see if the SEC should do more, as Rockefeller is suggesting.Meanwhile, Jarcho said that SEC examiners are planning to also make checks to ensure that asset managers are properly reporting major ""material"" cyber events to regulators.""We recognize that as we sit here, there are probably thousands if not millions of attempts right now going on, but they are minor,"" Jarcho told the audience. ""We don't expect each and every one to be reported,"" she added.",2014-01-30,LMT,"Thu Jan 30, 2014 | 2:38pm EST",SEC examiners to review how asset managers fend off cyber attacks,http://www.reuters.com//article/sec-cyber-assetmanagers-idUSL2N0L416A20140130?type=companyNews

Britain is expected to order the F-35 B vertical take-off variant of the Joint Strike Fighter.It has so far taken delivery of three training jets.The F-35, considered to be the world's most expensive weapons programme at $396 billion so far, was designed to be the next-generation fighter jet for the U.S. Air Force, Navy and Marines. It is being built by the United States, Britain and seven other co-development partners - Italy, Turkey, Canada, Australia, Denmark, Norway and the Netherlands.British companies such as BAE Systems (BAES.L) and Rolls Royce (RR.L) build 15 percent of each F-35 aircraft.Hammond said he was not worried by reports of technical issues that could delay the F-35's entry into service. A U.S. Defense Department report last week warned that software, maintenance and reliability problems with the stealth fighter could delay the U.S. Marine Corps' plans to start using its F-35 jets by mid-2015.""This is a complex weapons procurement programme.

The plane can also be used for aerial spray, firefighting, medical evaluations, humanitarian aid and VIP transport, Lockheed said.Lockheed spokeswoman Stephanie Stinn said the civil variant was certified by the FAA in 1998, but Lockheed let the certification lapse as it focused the military C-130J variant, which has racked up over 1 million flight hours worldwide. Crisler said it would take about three years to build the first LM-100Js, followed by about a year of testing before the civil version of the plane was re-certified.Crisler said Lockheed was also in talks with 12 foreign countries about additional C-130J orders, adding that he expected several orders to be placed this year.He said the company expected the C-130J line, now producing 24 aircraft a year, to keep running until beyond the end of the decade given continued strong demand.""The prospects internationally for the C-130J are very good,"" Crisler said.(Reporting by Andrea Shalal-Esa; Editing by David Gregorio)",2014-02-03,LMT,"Mon Feb 3, 2014 | 6:49pm EST",Lockheed launches civil version of C-130J military transport plane,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-lockheed-transport-faa-idUSBREA121PI20140203?type=companyNews

The plane can also be used for aerial spray, firefighting, medical evaluations, humanitarian aid and VIP transport, Lockheed said. Lockheed spokeswoman Stephanie Stinn said the civil variant was certified by the FAA in 1998, but Lockheed let the certification lapse as it focused the military C-130J variant, which has racked up over 1 million flight hours worldwide.Crisler said it would take about three years to build the first LM-100Js, followed by about a year of testing before the civil version of the plane was re-certified.Crisler said Lockheed was also in talks with 12 foreign countries about additional C-130J orders, adding that he expected several orders to be placed this year.He said the company expected the C-130J line, now producing 24 aircraft a year, to keep running until beyond the end of the decade given continued strong demand.""The prospects internationally for the C-130J are very good,"" Crisler said.",2014-02-03,LMT,"Mon Feb 3, 2014 | 6:45pm EST",Lockheed launches civil version of C-130J military transport plane,http://www.reuters.com//article/lockheed-transport-faa-idUSL2N0L81WC20140203?type=companyNews
23,"   By Lewis Krauskopf | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Feb 5 The U.S. Defense Department remains skeptical of mergers involving its major contractors, a Pentagon official said on Wednesday, amid industry expectations that defense deal-making could revive this year.Elana Broitman, whose office at the Defense Department reviews deals that involve national security issues, told an investor conference that ""there are far fewer of the large firms, so we're in a more constrained environment.""Even though we're seeing a budget downturn which has corresponded to consolidation in the past, we'd be less comfortable now because of that smaller number,"" said Broitman, the acting deputy assistant secretary of defense for manufacturing and industrial base policy.Defense M&A activity ground to a near halt in recent years amid uncertainty about future U.S. military spending that has kept sellers on edge and buyers more apt to invest in share buybacks and dividend payouts than acquisitions.The recent two-year budget agreement is expected to give some clarity to executives and potentially pave the way for more transactions. Most experts have been dubious of mergers among the biggest defense contractors - including Lockheed Martin Corp, Boeing Co, Raytheon Co and Northrop Grumman Corp  - although they believe the lack of a longer-term budget deal could spark the desire for large-scale deal-making.Top U.S. defense officials have repeatedly said they are not looking for mergers among top-tier suppliers, but analysts have wondered if deeper budget cuts under sequestration had changed the Pentagon's view.Broitman, whose comments came during a panel discussion at Cowen & Co's Aerospace/Defense & Transportation Conference, said the Pentagon would ""review each transaction on its face."" ""We're not really looking for more consolidation at the prime level, but we will review others as a case-by-case transaction,"" Broitman said.Deals that might raise eyebrows include those that would reduce the competition to one supplier, she said. ""There are areas...in the industrial base where we are down to a single or two smaller-scale companies without which we can't do a lot of our systems, and we're not comfortable going offshore for those types of products,"" Broitman said.Asked during the discussion about how the Pentagon would view a private equity buyout, Broitman said, ""It's just not something we've focused on.""However, she later added that a buyout by an equity firm that has foreign investors could prompt a more complex regulatory review.Northrop Chief Executive Officer Wes Bush was asked about taking the company private during the company's earnings call last week, but said the company was more focused now on share buybacks and dividend payments.She also said that while spinoffs from large companies could encourage more competition, ""I don't foresee a lot of just pure spinouts right now unless there are some tax reasons in some cases that make it really attractive.""",2014-02-05,LMT,"Wed Feb 5, 2014 | 6:36pm EST",U.S. Defense Dept not comfortable if major contractors look to merge -official,http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-defense-mergers-idUSL2N0LA20120140205?type=companyNews
24,"  (Corrects para 3 - show dates Feb. 11-16)By Siva Govindasamy and Tim HepherSINGAPORE Feb 7 Aerospace firms will finalise billions of dollars of deals at next week's Singapore Airshow, hoping to ride out a storm in emerging markets whose prosperity is vital to their plans to keep producing record numbers of jets.Asia's largest aerospace gathering is usually a ""show and tell"" event where executives come to mingle with some of the world's biggest long-haul carriers and Asia's ambitious new travel tycoons, as well as the region's busy military buyers.After a record $200 billion of deals at last November's Dubai Airshow, few expect Asian buyers to be ordering in similar quantities - yet the Feb. 11-16 event will test the appetite of one of aviation's fastest growing regions.""Asia is a huge market but has been somewhat eclipsed by the Gulf which has the same idea about how to pursue traffic and got to the orders race a few months before Singapore,"" said aerospace analyst Richard Aboulafia, vice president at Virgina-based Teal Group.Vietnamese, Indian and Thai carriers will place orders for over 100 Airbus or Boeing passenger jets worth $12 billion at list prices, industry officials say. Malaysian Airlines could also place an order for Airbus long-haul and medium-haul jets.Both Airbus and Boeing have committed to record production rates for their most popular models and have longer-term plans to produce more than 100 narrowbody jets a month between them - churning out a $100 million jet every few working hours.But executives will be looking out for any signs that financial turmoil in key aviation markets like Indonesia and Thailand will threaten economic growth, which directly determines the level of air traffic demand.""The manufacturers might be getting ahead of themselves given the troubles in emerging markets,"" said Aboulafia.""Many of these markets are in some form of currency crisis or economic downturn and the focus will be coming back to the Middle East and a hoped-for North American resurgence."" The world's no. 1 planemaker Boeing does not see its commercial jet business affected by weakness in emerging markets, Chief Executive Jim McNerney said this week. But he noted more divergence among such countries, and China and the Middle East remained strong.""Some perspective is very important. We have a short term blip in growth and the orders that are being placed are for the long term, for the requirements eight, nine or 10 years out,"" said Peter Harbison, chairman of the aviation analysts CAPA.Airbus and Boeing will face off for the first time with their latest lightweight long-haul jets, the 787 Dreamliner and the Airbus A350. The A350 will make its first full air show appearance.ARMS FAIR  As well as being a magnet for commercial aviators, next week's event in Singapore is a weapons bazaar which has grown in importance as China's increased military assertiveness has raised concerns.U.S. arms makers are counting on increased foreign sales to offset slower demand from U.S. and European governments, whose military budgets are under increasing pressure.While global military spending has been on the decline over the past few years, reflected in the Pentagon's own budget cuts, Asian spending is on the up.""Asia Pacific is the only region where from 2009 onwards we have seen a steady rise in defence expenditure,"" said Craig Caffrey, senior analyst, IHS Jane's Aerospace, Defence & Security, in a recent report.""Based on IHS Jane's Defence Budgets projections, Asia Pacific's share of global budget spend will grow to 28 percent from its current 24 percent by the end of the decade, reaching $474 billion."" China looms large in Asia, where it has overlapping territorial claims with several Southeast Asia countries in the South China Sea. At the same, China-Japan tensions have risen over their rival claims to a set of tiny uninhabited islands in the East China Sea.North Korea's pursuit of nuclear weapons adds another serious dimension to what is shaping up as an arms race in Asia.In Singapore, shoppers can choose from fighter jets, trainers, cargo planes, maritime patrol aircraft, drones, defence radar systems, missiles, and missile defences.The host country, although one of the smallest in the region, has the deepest pockets and is eyeing new jets.Its immediate priority is a billion dollar upgrade of its F-16s, but it is also looking at buying the stealthy F-35, which is built by Lockheed Martin Corp.Japan has already placed an order for the F-35 - a so-called ""fifth-generation"" warplane designed to be nearly invisible to enemy radar - and South Korea is expected to finalise an order for the jet this month.Malaysia is assessing the Boeing F/A-18, Dassault  Rafale, Eurofighter Typhoon and Saab Gripen to replace its ageing MiG-29 fighters, while Indonesia is also seen as a potentially big customer for fighter jets.Singapore and Japan are also eyeing the V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor plans built by Boeing and Bell Helicopter, a unit of Textron Inc. The U.S. Marine Corps is sending two of the planes, which take off and land like helicopters but fly like planes, to the air show.U.S. officials are expecting questions and interest in missile defense systems built by Lockheed and Raytheon Co, Boeing's maritime P-8 surveillance plane, and the KC-46A refueling plane, also built by Boeing. South Korea is expected to kick off a tanker competition this spring.

25,"  By Andrea Shalal-EsaWASHINGTON Feb 11 Top U.S. arms maker Lockheed Martin Corp on Tuesday said it had signed an agreement with a unit of Ocean Power Technologies Inc to harness the motion of ocean waves to generate electricity off the coast of Victoria, Australia.The A$230 million ($205.68 million) deal will produce the world's largest wave energy project using power buoys designed by Ocean Power Technologies that tap energy from the surface motion of waves.News of the deal sent Ocean Power's shares up nearly 60 percent to $3.66 on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange. Lockheed shares rose 2.5 percent to $157.82 on the New York Stock Exchange.Once completed around 2018 or 2019, the project will generate 62.5 megawatts of peak power, enough to meet the needs of 10,000 homes, Lockheed said. That is about one-third the capacity of a small coal-fired power plant in the United States. ""Ocean energy is a tremendously large, untapped resource which has global applicability,"" said Tim Fuhr, director of ocean energy for Lockheed. ""You can pretty much get ocean energy on coastlines around the world. It's essentially clean and the fuel is free.""The agreement is part of a drive by Lockheed - the maker of F-35 fighter jets and coastal warships - to expand its foothold in the alternative energy business as it seeks to offset a slump in U.S. and European military budgets.The company last year announced a deal with Chinese consumer products firm Reignwood Group to design the biggest power station fueled by differences in ocean temperatures.  It also has projects based on tidal power. Energy from ocean waves is more predictable than wind and solar energy, and can generate electricity for more hours in the year than other alternate energy sources, Lockheed said.The power buoys to be used in this project will rise about 30 feet (9.1 meters) out of the water, far smaller than wind turbines, which are typically 130 feet (40 meters) tall and have drawn public resistance.Fuhr said Lockheed had worked with Ocean Power Technologies on several smaller projects for the U.S. Department of Energy since 2004, and kicked off initial work on this project about 18 months ago. Lockheed recently signed an agreement with Victorian Wave Partners, an Australian special purpose company owned by Ocean Power, to develop the wave project. The goal is to complete the first phase by 2014 or 2015, producing about 2.5 megawatts of peak power, Lockheed said.Fuhr said Lockheed hoped to leverage its design and engineering skills to help commercialize the new energy source in coming years. Under the agreement with Victorian Wave, Lockheed will handle overall management of the project, assist with design for manufacturing of the power buoys, produce selected components, and integrate the wave energy converters.Lockheed was part of a consortium that built the first net-power producing facility in the 1970s based on ocean thermal energy conversion. Since then, it has invested tens of millions of dollars in ocean energy initiatives, Fuhr said.He said Lockheed was beginning to see revenues from those investments, but declined to provide estimates for the amount.

32,"   By Andrea Shalal-Esa | HUNTSVILLE, Alabama  HUNTSVILLE, Alabama The U.S. Army has unveiled new technology that will for the first time allow AH-64 Apache helicopter pilots to see targeting and surveillance data in full, high-resolution color, instead of the fuzzy black and white images they get now.An Army official said new sensors developed by Lockheed Martin Corp over the past four years could help avoid mistakes such as the 2007 attack by two U.S. Apache helicopters that killed 12 people in Baghdad, including two Reuters news staff, after they were mistaken for armed insurgents.U.S. Central Command has said an investigation of the incident found that U.S. forces were not aware of the presence of the news staffers and believed a camera held by one of the men was a rocket-propelled grenade launcher.""This additional situational awareness ... will give soldiers what they need to make the right decisions on the battlefield,"" Army Lieutenant Colonel Steven Van Riper, the Army's product manager for the Apache sensors, told reporters when asked if the new technology help avert such mistakes.""That's our goal ... This will cut dramatically the amount of voice communications and other things that take precious time on the battlefield, time that could be used better to make decisions,"" he said during a demonstration at Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, Alabama, where the Army tests new aircraft.""Now they can focus on those tasks and not worry, 'Am I looking at the right thing?'""

35,"  * BAE sees 2014 earnings per share down 5-10 pct* Shares in biggest one-day fall in five years* 2013 EBITA 1.93 bln stg vs 1.87 bln stg in 2012By Brenda GohLONDON, Feb 20 Europe's biggest defence contractor BAE Systems warned on Thursday it expected earnings this year to drop by up to 10 percent as a result of U.S. spending cuts, with conditions still difficult despite a recent budget deal in Congress.The British group, which had announced on Wednesday that it had at last agreed a price increase on its sale of Eurofighter Typhoon jets to Saudi Arabia, saw its shares suffer their biggest one-day percentage fall since Oct. 2008.They fell 11.1 percent in early trading to 388.1 pence, wiping 1.5 billion pounds ($2.5 billion) off the firm's market value.""The storms of U.S. defence cuts ... have passed, but their shadows linger in full-year 2014,"" said Jefferies analyst Sandy Morris, adding that BAE's earnings per share expectations were 4 to 5 percent lower than Jefferies' forecast of 40.8 pence.Agency Partners analyst Nick Cunningham called the guidance ""very weak"" saying that it measured against previous expectations of flat earnings per share.At 1311 GMT, shares in BAE cut some of their early losses to trade 8.2 percent lower at 401 pence. It was the biggest faller on the FTSE 100 which was down 0.26 percent. For 2013 BAE reported a 9 percent rise in underlying earnings per share to 42 pence and said it expected earnings to fall by 5 to 10 percent in 2014, driven down by the combination of U.S. budgetary pressures and the non-recurring benefit from the settlement of the Salam deal with Saudi Arabia, which had already been anticipated in the 2013 result.Finance Director Peter Lynas said the majority of the forecasted fall in earnings was due to the price settlement, as the company had already delivered 34 of the 72 aircraft sold, meaning that it had recouped the benefits of the pricing deal against those aircraft in last year's results.Nervousness amongst investors over defence spending cuts was already evident last week when Rolls-Royce's share price tumbled after it said U.S. and European spending cuts would halt a decade-long run of profit growth for the engine maker.BAE said while a two-year bi-partisan federal budget deal passed by U.S. Congress late last year eased ""the significant and indiscriminate cuts that were expected in 2014 and 2015"", it expected pressures to reduce spending and address the U.S. deficit to continue. PAIN Its U.S. businesses - Intelligence & Security and Land & Armaments - took a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of 865 million pounds in 2013 due to increased weighted average cost of capital and an estimate of reduced U.S. defence spending. It expects Land & Armaments sales to fall 20-25 percent in 2014.""Budget pressures in some of the group's larger markets are expected to prevail but BAE Systems has a broad-based portfolio,"" Chief Executive Ian King said.Lynas, however, said that they believed the U.S. businesses  had endured most of the pain in 2013 and that it was close to ""bottoming out"" in 2014. BAE had previously forecast a decline of 15 percent in its U.S. defence and security units.Other contractors such as Lockheed Martin and Raytheon have also said they expect the brunt of U.S. cuts would be felt this year. BAE's results for last year were in line with analyst expectations, with underlying earnings before interest, tax and amortisation (EBITA) up 3.4 percent at 1.925 billion pounds on sales up 2 percent at 18.2 billion pounds. It maintained its order book backlog at 2012 levels at 42.7 billion pounds.Analysts on average had expected the company to make a profit at the EBITA level of 1.897 billion pounds, on revenue of 18.8 billion pounds, according to Thomson Reuters data. Earnings per share were on average expected to be 42.5 pence.The firm's net debt was 699 million pounds, compared with a net cash position of 387 million pounds at the end of 2012, which analysts said was much better than their expectations. BAE's cash flow is traditionally volatile as it is affected by when customers make payments on contracts.The company also said it would be ""upping the pace"" on its 1 billion-pound share buyback programme following the Salam deal's resolution. So far it has bought back 65 million shares for about 271 million pounds.On Germany's cancellation of its final shipment of 37 Eurofighter jets, King said BAE would not be affected as it had took the order out of its financial assumptions three years ago.Following the conclusion of Salam, BAE is still in talks with Saudi Arabia over future contracts, he said.The company raised its final dividend to 12.1 pence a share from 11.7 a year ago to increase the total payout for the year by 3 percent to 20.1 pence.",2014-02-20,LMT,"Thu Feb 20, 2014 | 9:18am EST",RPT-UPDATE 3-BAE warns U.S. defence spending cuts to hit earnings this year,http://www.reuters.com//article/bae-results-idUSL6N0LP10R20140220?type=companyNews

""Root cause analysis is still ongoing, however based on preliminary analysis a redesign of the affected F-35B structural members will be required.""Kendall said the F-35 remained the Pentagon's highest priority conventional warfare program. ""Nothing has changed,"" he said. ""There isn't any question about the department's commitment to the F-35.""The latest technical issue involving the $392 billion F-53 fighter program, the Pentagon's most expensive arms development project, arose during on-ground durability testing of the short takeoff, vertical landing (STOVL) version of the plane in September, according to the Pentagon's F-35 program office.The issue was first flagged in a report by the Pentagon's chief weapons tester, Michael Gilmore, that also raised concerns about the F-35 software development effort. The news comes at a time when Turkey and Canada are weighing orders for the plane. Both countries helped fund development of the plane, but have not yet ordered aircraft.Britain, which is buying the Marine Corps version of the plane, had been expected to finalize orders for 14 more aircraft early this year, but the announcement has been delayed. UK officials took a ""hard look"" at the bulkhead issue but did not alter their procurement plans, according to a source familiar with the program.Joe DellaVedova, spokesman for the Pentagon's F-35 program office, said officials were keeping all the international partners on the program informed about the bulkhead issue. DellaVedova said cracks were initially found in the airplane's four primary bulkheads in September, but additional cracks appeared during follow-on inspections in January.The additional cracks were first reported earlier Friday by Bloomberg.In a joint statement, Lockheed and the F-35 office said the issue would not affect flight testing of the planes because the cracks developed at over 9,400 flight hours - well beyond the planned 8,000-hour lifespan that the plane is designed for. ""This discovery does not affect current F-35B flying operations, nor is it expected to impact the U.S. Marine Corps' ability to meet its Initial Operating Capability (IOC) in 2015,"" the statement said.Marine Corps spokesman Captain Rich Ulsh said the Marines still expect to start using the F-35B for military operations in July 2015, as planned.""This finding only affects the future modification schedules to our aircraft so they can achieve the intended service life of the aircraft, which is 8,000 hours,"" he said.It was not immediately clear how much the redesign of the bulkhead or any needed retrofits would cost.In his statement, Kendall said the program hoped to have modified parts available in time for the ninth production batch of F-35s, and was assessing the impact on the eighth batch. Lockheed is in negotiations now with the Pentagon about a contract for the eighth batch of jets.""STOVL aircraft that have been produced already will also need some strengthening in the affected areas,"" he said.",2014-02-21,LMT,"Fri Feb 21, 2014 | 1:55pm EST","UPDATE 1-F-35 cracks need redesign, Marines still on track for 2015 combat use",http://www.reuters.com//article/lockheed-fighter-idUSL2N0LQ1UP20140221?type=companyNews

41,"   By Tulay Karadeniz | ANKARA  ANKARA Turkey is likely to start ordering F-35 fighter jets built by Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) from 2015 onwards and it will start with two orders initially, Turkey's undersecretary for state-run defense industries Murad Bayar said on Thursday.""We will start F-35 orders either this year or the next. Right now, it is likely to be next year,"" Bayar told reporters. ""We will initially order two. The delivery time will be, depending on the orders, probably in 2017-2018.""Turkey had already announced it plans to buy 100 F-35 jets for $16 billion. Bayar said he expected the deliveries of 100 aircraft to be completed within 10 years.The F-35, considered to be the world's most expensive weapons program at $396 billion so far, was designed to be the next-generation fighter jet for the U.S. forces.It is being built by the United States, Britain and seven other co-development partners - Italy, Turkey, Canada, Australia, Denmark, Norway and the Netherlands.Separately, Bayar said Turkey was aiming to achieve results in April on its talks with China over the purchase of long-range missile defense systems, a move highly criticized by Turkey's NATO allies.In September Turkey chose China's FD-2000 missile-defense system over rival offers from Franco-Italian Eurosam SAMP/T and U.S.-listed Raytheon Co (RTN.N). It said China offered the most competitive terms and would allow co-production in Turkey. U.S. and NATO officials have raised concerns with Turkish officials about the decision to buy the system from CPMIEC, a company hit by U.S. sanctions for sales of items to either Iran, Syria or North Korea that are banned under U.S. laws to curb the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.""Our talks with China are ongoing. We have extended the bidding until the end of April. We are aiming to get results in early April on this,"" Bayar said.AIRBUS DELIVERIES Bayar also said Turkey will seek compensation over the late delivery of the A400 military transport plane after Airbus (AIR.PA) failed to meet some of its contractual obligations. ""My message to Airbus is that it should first focus on fulfilling the terms of the contract. There is no additional bargaining here. The contract, even with the amended version, requires the fulfillment of certain technical qualities and we have had to hold these talks because these requirements were not completely fulfilled,"" Bayar said.On Wednesday, Airbus chief executive Tom Enders said bargaining was behind the delay and that it was 'unbearable' that the company was still negotiating with Turkey over the plane.""The aircraft is ready to go. It is instantly, operationally fit for flight.

42,"  * Turkey to order two F-35 jets, likely to start in 2015* Aiming progress on missile talks with China in April* Turkey to seek compensation from Airbus over late deliveryBy Tulay KaradenizANKARA, Feb 27 Turkey is likely to start ordering F-35 fighter jets built by Lockheed Martin Corp  from 2015 onwards and it will start with two orders initially, Turkey's undersecretary for state-run defence industries Murad Bayar said on Thursday.""We will start F-35 orders either this year or the next. Right now, it is likely to be next year,"" Bayar told reporters. ""We will initially order two. The delivery time will be, depending on the orders, probably in 2017-2018.""Turkey had already announced it plans to buy 100 F-35 jets for $16 billion. Bayar said he expected the deliveries of 100 aircraft to be completed within 10 years.The F-35, considered to be the world's most expensive weapons programme at $396 billion so far, was designed to be the next-generation fighter jet for the U.S. forces.It is being built by the United States, Britain and seven other co-development partners - Italy, Turkey, Canada, Australia, Denmark, Norway and the Netherlands.Separately, Bayar said Turkey was aiming to achieve results in April on its talks with China over the purchase of long-range missile defence systems, a move highly criticised by Turkey's NATO allies. In September Turkey chose China's FD-2000 missile-defence system over rival offers from Franco-Italian Eurosam SAMP/T and U.S.-listed Raytheon Co. It said China offered the most competitive terms and would allow co-production in Turkey.U.S. and NATO officials have raised concerns with Turkish officials about the decision to buy the system from CPMIEC, a company hit by U.S. sanctions for sales of items to either Iran, Syria or North Korea that are banned under U.S. laws to curb the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.""Our talks with China are ongoing. We have extended the bidding until the end of April. We are aiming to get results in early April on this,"" Bayar said. AIRBUS DELIVERIES Bayar also said Turkey will seek compensation over the late delivery of the A400 military transport plane after Airbus  failed to meet some of its contractual obligations.""My message to Airbus is that it should first focus on fulfilling the terms of the contract. There is no additional bargaining here. The contract, even with the amended version, requires the fulfilment of certain technical qualities and we have had to hold these talks because these requirements were not completely fulfilled,"" Bayar said.On Wednesday, Airbus chief executive Tom Enders said bargaining was behind the delay and that it was 'unbearable' that the company was still negotiating with Turkey over the plane.""The aircraft is ready to go. It is instantly, operationally fit for flight. I find the situation increasingly unacceptable,"" Enders told reporters.

43,"  By Andrea ShalalWASHINGTON, March 4 The Pentagon's 2015 budget request includes $7.2 billion for satellites and other space-based programs but saves $2.1 billion over the next five years by scrapping plans for two Lockheed Martin Corp  communications satellites.The fiscal 2015 budget, which would postpone other purchases and launch a new program to replace aging weather satellites, reflects recent efforts by the U.S. Air Force to develop more resilient systems to augment the large-scale satellites it has built in the past.The two Lockheed Martin satellites are the seventh and eighth Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) satellites that Lockheed was slated to build. The Air Force said it planned to postpone work on two Global Positioning System III satellites, also to be built by Lockheed, until after fiscal 2019, since the GPS satellites already in orbit were lasting longer than forecast.The service said it was exploring a different approach to satellite communications and overhead infrared monitoring, with the goal of making satellite systems more flexible, responsive and cheaper, while replacing obsolete technology. The Pentagon said the 2015 budget would start detailed design studies of the Space Based Infrared System satellite program run by Lockheed, as well as programs aimed at reducing software and hardware risks.The budget also kicks off a new program to replace the aging Defense Meteorological Satellite program, focusing on smaller satellites and hosted payloads that are less expensive to build and launch, and would put a bigger focus on partnerships with other countries and other institutions. ""The Weather System Follow-On (WSF) will be comprised of a group of systems to provide timely, reliable, and high-quality space-based remote sensing capabilities,"" the Air Force said.Details about the Air Force's acquisition plans were not immediately available, but the decision to fund a more ""disaggregated"" approach spells good news for companies like Harris Corp and Exelis Inc and others that have been pressing the Air Force to move in this direction.The Pentagon's fiscal 2015 budget also resumes work on a new Space Fence, a ground-based system of radars that tracks objects in space. Raytheon Co and Lockheed had competed for a contract to build it, but the contract award had been delayed from fiscal 2013 to this year.",2014-03-04,LMT,"Tue Mar 4, 2014 | 3:20pm EST","UPDATE 1-Pentagon budget scraps two Lockheed satellites, postpones others",http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-fiscal-weapons-space-idUSL1N0M11I620140304?type=companyNews
44,"  WASHINGTON, March 4 The U.S. Defense Department's fiscal 2015 budget includes $8.5 billion in funding for missile defense programs and reaffirms the Obama administration's plan to build 14 additional ground-based interceptors by 2017.The budget request, which must still be approved by Congress, includes $99.5 million to start work on a new common ""kill vehicle,"" the top part of the ground-based interceptor that hits and destroys an incoming enemy missile on contact.The new kill vehicle would eventually replace the current one built by Raytheon Co, which has suffered several test failures, the Pentagon said in budget documents. It did not spell out which kill vehicle would be used on the 14 new interceptors to be built.Pentagon acquisition chief Frank Kendall told a conference last week that a new kill vehicle was needed, noting that the reviews of the program had revealed ""bad engineering"" on the current system.Missile defense is one of the biggest items in the Pentagon's annual budget, although Republicans have faulted the Obama administration for scaling back funding in recent years.Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said the budget, which was informed by a major review of defense strategy, underscored the continued importance of missile defense, along with space, cyber and special operations, giving rapidly emerging threats. Boeing Co is the prime contractor for the U.S. ground-based missile defense system, while Raytheon builds the kill vehicle and Orbital Sciences Corp makes the rocket that launches it into space.Riki Ellison, chairman and founder of the nonprofit Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance, welcomed the funding increase for missile defense programs and said efforts to modernize the current ground-based system were overdue after its rushed initial deployment in 2004.""It unequivocally has to be modernized, redesigned and fully integrated to handle the upcoming advancing threats of Iran, North Korea and others,"" Ellison said. Boeing, Raytheon and Lockheed Martin Corp are already working on early designs of a new common kill vehicle.There were no immediate details on the acquisition plan for the redesigned kill vehicle, or KV, but the Pentagon said it would be built with a modular, open architecture and designed with common interfaces to make upgrades easier, and help broaden the vendor and supplier base.""The KV will improve reliability, be more producible and cost-effective, and will eventually replace the KV on the current ground-based interceptor fleet,"" the Pentagon said in its budget plan. It said the next intercept test was planned for the third quarter of 2014, and it would focus on the reliability and performance of the ground-based missile defense system.The budget also kicks off a program for a new long-range radar to be deployed by 2020, providing initial funding of $79.5 million, and said it would invest in several initiatives aimed at addressing ballistic missile threats ""that are expected to increase in numbers and complexity.""It also funds a seventh Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) battery built by Lockheed, and 31 THAAD interceptors, as well as 70 new Missile Segment Enhancement missiles built by Lockheed for a cost of $420 million.Raytheon builds the AN/TPY-2 radar used by the THAAD system.",2014-03-04,LMT,"Tue Mar 4, 2014 | 3:35pm EST","UPDATE 2-Pentagon aims to replace Raytheon missile ""kill vehicle""",http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-fiscal-missile-defense-idUSL1N0M11ET20140304?type=companyNews

46,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The U.S. Navy plans to add 22 Boeing electronic attack jets to a list of ""unfunded"" priorities requested by Congress, but the document must still be vetted by senior Pentagon officials, who have underscored their commitment to Lockheed Martin Corp's next-generation F-35 fighter jet, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel told the military services in a memo on Thursday they could respond to the House Armed Services Committee's request, but said the lists should be coordinated with his office and that of General Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, according to a defense official.The defense official and multiple other sources spoke on Wednesday and Thursday on condition of anonymity because the unfunded priorities lists have not yet been formally submitted to Congress.Given that shrinking budgets are leaving the services with myriad unmet needs, Hagel does not intend follow the lead of former Defense Secretary Robert Gates, who tried to block the lists from being sent to Capitol Hill, the official said.""This is a different time. We've had to make tough choices, and budgets are coming down. Part of what we want to do is demonstrate to Congress that our military has needs that are not fulfilled by sequestration,"" the official said.At the same time, the department's priorities were clearly outlined in its 2015 budget plan and the separate $26.4 billion ""growth fund"" set up by the White House, the official said.And those priorities, said two of the sources, did not include more Boeing Co F/A-18 Super Hornets or EA-18G Growlers, which will end production in 2016 unless more orders come in.The Navy did not seek funding for either plane in its budget, or in its part of the separate ""growth"" fund. But it plans to add 22 Growlers to its unfunded priorities list, said four sources familiar with the issue. A Navy spokesman declined to comment, saying only that the service was still finalizing its unfunded priorities list.The document also includes eight P-8A surveillance planes built by Boeing for $1.1 billion, and restores funding for continued operation of the USS George Washington carrier and its associated air wing, said one source familiar with the Navy list.The document put the cost of the extra planes at $2.14 billion and said they would let the Navy expand each Growler squadron on a carrier to seven jets from five, offering more electronic attack capabilities for the joint force, the source said.The document also referenced ongoing studies by the Navy and the Defense Department that pointed to increasing threats.A second source said the Navy's request for more Growlers was likely to meet resistance from senior defense officials, given competing demands for resources, a strong commitment to the F-35, which includes a carrier-based model for the Navy, and a general shift away from single-purpose aircraft. ""There is no validated requirement,"" said the source.Navy and senior U.S. defense officials have repeatedly said they have no plans to extend Boeing's F/A-18 and EA-18G production line in St. Louis, which is due to shut after 2016.Boeing spokeswoman Karen Fincutter urged Congress to add funding for the Growlers to keep the production line going.""The Super Hornet and Growler are the backbone of the Navy's carrier air wings today, and will be through at least 2040. If funding to extend production of those aircraft isn't provided, unique industrial capabilities will be lost and the U.S. will be solely dependent on one tactical aircraft manufacturer for years to come,"" she said. Congress already added $75 million in funding for advanced procurement for 22 EA-18G jets to the Navy's fiscal 2014 budget, but those funds have not yet been released.Congressional aides say lawmakers need evidence of the Navy's interest in extra Growlers to justify adding funding to the fiscal 2015 budget, but caution that finding $2 billion for 22 more EA-18G jets would mean cuts elsewhere.""It means you have to slaughter somebody else's ox,"" said one aide who was not authorized to speak publicly.Boeing has said it can slow production of the jets to around two planes a month without a big impact on pricing. It said it could stretch production into mid-2017, if the Navy agrees to a slower delivery rate of jets already on order.That means Congress could fund about half the 22 Growlers and still allow the production line to keep running through 2017, said one source familiar with the matter.House Armed Services Committee Chairman Buck McKeon last month asked the services, combatant commanders and National Guard to submit a list of programs that did not get included in the budget. He left the door open to a number of programs, asking for those needed to meet a ""validated requirement"" or other military priority, as well as items for which requirements emerged after the budget was drafted.The sources said the Marine Corps was also expected to ask for six F-35 fighter jets as part of its unfunded priorities list. It plans to ask for one F-35 B-model jet, which can land like a helicopter, and five F-35 carrier models, to replace six Harrier jets destroyed in Afghanistan.(Reporting by Andrea Shalal; Editing by Richard Chang)",2014-03-07,LMT,"Thu Mar 6, 2014 | 8:49pm EST",Exclusive: U.S. Navy aims to put 22 Boeing fighters on 'unfunded' list - sources,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-usa-fiscal-boeing-fighter-idUSBREA2603U20140307?type=companyNews
47,"  By Andrea ShalalWASHINGTON, March 10 The U.S. Navy has awarded contracts worth nearly $1.4 billion to buy four more Littoral Combat Ships from Lockheed Martin Corp and Australia's Austal Ltd, the U.S. Defense Department said on Monday.Lockheed won a contract valued at $699 million to build two more of its steel monohull-design ships, while Austal won a contract worth $684 million to build two more of its aluminum trimaran design, the Pentagon said in its daily digest of major weapons contracts.Lockheed welcomed the contract, which covers the seventh and eighth ships it is building under a 10-ship contract awarded in December 2010, and said it was awaiting news of how the Pentagon planned to proceed with the LCS program.Lockheed and Australia's Austal each build a different model of the LCS-class ships, which are designed to carry interchangeable equipment packages for mine-hunting, surface warfare or anti-submarine missions. General Dynamics Corp  is a major supplier for the Austal version of the ship. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel announced last month that he wants to stop building the current configuration of ships after 32 ships, instead of building all 52 that were planned, and focus instead on ships with more firepower and protection.The Navy is in the middle of executing separate 10-ship block buys with both Lockheed and Austal, which will bring the total number of LCS ships to 24.Lockheed and Austal are waiting for details on how the Navy plans to procure the next eight ships that bring the total to 32 before shifting gear toward a more survivable ship. Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Jonathan Greenert told reporters on Monday that he would set up task force to look at the issue in coming days, and hoped to get preliminary recommendations from the group by July, in time to help inform the Navy's fiscal 2016 budget planning process.He said the task force would look at a variety of options, including modifying the current LCS ships, including possibly installing some mission equipment permanently on the ships, using a foreign design, or starting with a whole new design.But new design would be costly and take a long time to execute, Greenert said. ""It would be quite a challenge,"" he said, adding the Navy would have to use some ""fairly mature"" technologies to get the ships built in time. Joe North, vice president of littoral ship systems at Lockheed, said that his company would be able to offer the best pricing to the Navy if it ordered the next eight ships as part of a block buy, rather than ordering them one year at a time.North said he remained convinced that the LCS ships were the most cost effective ships in the Navy, and said Lockheed was standing by to learn about what additional capabilities the Navy wanted to add to the class in future years.He said Lockheed continued to explore possible foreign arms sales of the steel monohull design it is building for the Navy.The Pentagon said work on the next two Lockheed LCS ships would be completed by August 2018. The next two Austal ships would be completed by June 2018, it said.",2014-03-10,LMT,"Mon Mar 10, 2014 | 6:31pm EDT","UPDATE 1-U.S. Navy awards contracts to Lockheed, Austal for 4 more ships",http://www.reuters.com//article/navy-ships-idUSL2N0M71YR20140310?type=companyNews

52,"  ROME, March 17 Italy may cut its order for 90 Lockheed Martin F-35 fighter jets as part of broad reductions in public spending, Prime Minister Matteo Renzi said late on Sunday.Renzi said Italy was seeking 3 billion euros ($4.18 billion)in savings on its defence budget over the next three years from closing barracks and from big-ticket items like the F-35.""We will continue with our international programmes, we will continue with a strong air force but that programme will be revised,"" he said in an interview on Canale 5 television.The order, scheduled to cost some 11.8 billion euros over 45 years from 2015, has been the subject of prolonged uncertainty as successive governments have sought to bring strained public finances under control. The order has already been reduced from 131 aircraft and many in Renzi's centre-left Democratic Party (PD), as well as in opposition parties, would like to see it cut still further or scrapped altogether. Italy, already struggling to keep its budget deficit within the European Union's limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product and saddled with the second heaviest debt burden in the eurozone after Greece, is looking for billions of euros in spending cuts in the coming years.However cutting the order could affect Italian companies as it includes maintenance contracts for state-controlled defence technology group Finmeccanica. The F-35, designed to be the next-generation fighter for decades to come for U.S. forces and their allies in NATO, has been hit by technical faults and is several years behind schedule and 70 percent above early cost estimates.In a separate interview on SkyTG24 television, Defence Minister Roberta Pinotti said 385 barracks could be closed and the size of Italy's military could be cut over the next 10 years from 190,000 troops at present to 150,000 by 2024.",2014-03-17,LMT,"Mon Mar 17, 2014 | 4:02am EDT",Italy considers cutting F-35 fighter jet order,http://www.reuters.com//article/italy-defence-idUSL6N0ME1CR20140317?type=companyNews
53,"  * Italy cut F-35 order by 30 pct 2 years ago* Renzi said Sunday more cuts likely* Italy must keep deficit in check while reducing taxesBy Antonella Cinelli and Steve SchererROME, March 18 Italy's review of its military needs and possible cuts to its order for 90 Lockheed Martin  F-35 fighter jets will be decided by the end of the year, Defence Minister Roberta Pinotti said on Tuesday.Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, who announced 10 billion euros ($14 billion) in income-tax cuts last week, said on Sunday the radar-evading fighter planes order would be ""revised"" as he seeks to reduce public spending. On Tuesday, Pinotti said that before a decision on the plane orders was made, she would draw up a ""white paper"" that prioritises defence requirements.""We can finish by December,"" Pinotti said in testimony to parliament. The government is now committed to buy 90 of the warplanes for a total of 12 billion euros, but there is broad political support for further cuts to the programme, which almost two-thirds of Italians deem unnecessary, a recent poll showed.Italy is trying to keep the budget deficit within the European Union's limit of 3 percent of output and reduce debt while lowering taxes as Renzi seeks to spur consumer spending and create jobs in the chronically sluggish economy.But Italy is a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation with an ageing fleet of fighter jets that is supposed to be replaced by the F-35, and further cuts could affect maintenance contracts held by the state-controlled defence group Finmeccanica. Italy's highest-ranking military official Luigi Binelli Mantelli said on Tuesday that the armed forces were already in the process of reducing personnel by more than 20 percent by 2022.""I challenge any other (public) administration to plan 50,000 job cuts in 10 years,"" Binelli Mantelli told reporters at a conference in the capital.Renzi said last week that defence spending would be cut by 3.7 billion euros in 2015-16, while a table of planned cuts published by Italian media on Tuesday put cuts at 4.3 billion euros, but gave no details.""Further cuts can be made, and definitely there must be courage to get rid of the old and focus on what is most important,"" Binelli Mantelli said.

56,"  * Italy cut F-35 order by 30 pct 2 years ago* Renzi said Sunday more cuts likely* Military spending review due by end-yearBy Steve Scherer and Antonella CinelliROME, March 19 Italy should put its order for 90 Lockheed Martin F-35 fighter jets on hold and probably cut it ""significantly"", lawmakers in Prime Minister Matteo Renzi's Democratic Party (PD) say, according to a party document.The government has committed to spending an estimated 12 billion euros for the 90 radar-evading planes, but Renzi, who announced 10 billion euros ($13.91 billion) in income tax cuts last week, said on Sunday the order would be ""revised"" as he seeks to reduce public spending. A PD party paper seen by Reuters, which was distributed to PD lawmakers on Wednesday by PD defence committee member Gian Piero Scanu, says that the contracts should be frozen and that ""significant"" cuts are probably needed.The paper argues that the F-35 guaranteed Italy ""no significant industrial gains"" and that its cost ""cannot co-exist with the needs of our public finances.""The 10-page document suggests increasing common European Union defence initiatives and cutting spending on armaments and technology by 1 billion euros a year over the next decade. Italy's supreme defence council, including Renzi, ministers, the top military commander and President Giorgio Napolitano, agreed at a meeting on Wednesday that any cuts would not be made before a comprehensive review of the country's military needs, which is due to be completed by the end of this year. A statement issued after the meeting did not mention the fighter jet directly however.The military review will be conducted by a committee of military and civilian specialists.Italy cut its order for the planes by 30 percent two years ago to stem state expenditure during the euro zone debt crisis. Italian media have said that several PD lawmakers have called for the order, which has been dogged by technical problems and cost overruns, to be halved.Almost two-thirds of Italians deem the F-35 unnecessary, a recent poll showed, but it is supposed to replace the country's ageing fleet of fighter jets and further cuts could affect maintenance contracts held by the state-controlled defence group Finmeccanica.There is ""a perceptible unease among the public when faced with major military spending during a period characterized by serious economic and financial difficulties,"" the PD paper said.The euro zone's third-biggest economy suffered nine consecutive quarters of recession from mid-2011 through the third quarter of last year, and unemployment is at its highest level since the 1970s.Italy is also trying to keep the budget deficit within the EU's limit of 3 percent of output and reduce debt while lowering taxes as Renzi seeks to spur consumer spending and create jobs in the chronically sluggish economy.

57,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Congressional auditors have joined the Pentagon's chief arms tester in raising concerns about the pace of development of software on Lockheed Martin Corp's new F-35 fighter jet and recommended the military's F-35 program office assess the plane's ability to integrate specific weapons by July.A report by the Government Accountability Office, a congressional watchdog agency, said delays in software testing could increase development costs and might mean that the Marine Corps and other military services might not have all the weapons capabilities on their F-35 planes when they want to start using them in combat, according to sources briefed on the report.Air Force Lieutenant General Chris Bogdan, who runs the F-35 for the Pentagon, acknowledged that software remained the No. 1 technical risk on the $392 billion weapons program. He said his office had adopted disciplined processes to deal with the complexity of writing, integrating and testing the millions of lines of software code being written for the new warplane.Bogdan said the F-35 program agreed with the GAO's call for an assessment of the specific weapons capabilities that the F-35 would have when the Marine Corps and other military services want to start using it in combat, and already carefully monitored a series of software metrics.The GAO report was the latest in a series that focused on software risks facing the Pentagon's biggest arms program. The program is nearly 70 percent over budget and years behind schedule, but U.S. officials say it is making steady progress.The Pentagon's chief arms buyer, Frank Kendall, is also working on a report about software risks on the program. Lockheed is developing three models of the new warplane for the United States and eight countries that funded its design: Britain, Australia, Canada, Denmark, Norway, Italy, Turkey and the Netherlands. Israel and Japan have also ordered jets.Michael Gilmore, the Pentagon's director of operational testing and evaluation, warned in a January report that ongoing software, maintenance and reliability problems could delay the Marine Corps' plans to start using the F-35 jets by mid-2015.His report forecast a possible 13-month delay in completing testing of the Block 2B software needed for the Marines to achieve an ""initial operational capability"" by that date.The GAO report echoed those concerns, although it found the program was on a more stable footing. U.S. defense officials and Lockheed say the program is on track to develop initial warfighting capability for the Marine Corps in 2015 and the Air Force in 2016.Bogdan said there was more risk involved in getting the full warfighting capability done by 2018, when the Navy plans to start using its carrier variant in combat, since it was dependent on the successful delivery of the previous software.""We are working relentlessly to reduce this risk by tracking software development daily and fixing issues as we find them so the military services and our international partners will receive the F-35's full warfighting capability,"" Bogdan said in a statement on the GAO report. Lockheed said it had not seen the GAO report, but remained confident that it would complete flight testing this year of the software needed for the Marines to start using the jets in 2015.Lockheed spokesman B.J. Bolling said the company had completed six of 15 weapons delivery tests required in the test plan for the Block 2B software, with the remaining nine tests to be completed in coming months.Bolling said Gilmore's forecast of a 13-month delay also assumed a 120-percent growth in the number of test points in 2014, the same rate seen in 2013. But the 2013 growth was due largely to work on the complex helmet worn by F-35 pilots, which would not be required in 2014, he said.One U.S. Marine Corps official said the service's F-35 jets were flying more often and carrying out increased sorties, which was giving Marine Corps pilots more experience.""We're generally optimistic,"" said the official.

60,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON South Korea on Monday became the 10th country to choose Lockheed Martin Corp.'s (LMT.N) F-35 fighter jet to replace aging warplanes, a boost for the Pentagon's biggest weapons program at a time when Italy, Canada and other countries are rethinking their procurement plans.Lockheed executives hope to reel in a large number of foreign orders this year to offset budget-driven delays in U.S. purchases, but sales have proven elusive.""It's steady progress, but slower than hoped. The international orders are not coming in as fast as we hoped,"" Steve O'Bryan, Lockheed vice president and the company's main international F-35 salesman, told Reuters.Current plans call for the U.S. military and other countries to order 57 F-35 fighters in a ninth production batch of the new jets, short of the roughly 72 orders once expected. The Pentagon estimates it will spend $392 billion to develop the jet and buy 2,443 planes over the coming decades.News that South Korea expects to spend 7.34 trillion won ($6.79 billion) for 40 F-35s is a plus for Lockheed, said Richard Aboulafia, aerospace analyst with the Virginia-based Teal Group, but the company needs more orders to help drive down the unit cost of the new warplanes.""The risk is that it stays too expensive to order in large quantities, and the lack of large quantities means that it stays too expensive,"" he said.Lockheed is developing three models of the radar-evading jet for the U.S. military and eight countries that help fund its design: Britain, Australia, the Netherlands, Norway, Turkey, Italy, Denmark and Canada. From the start, the program was aimed at quickly ramping up production to 200 jets a year. But budget pressures have not been confined to the United States, and technical challenges have slowed that momentum as well.Pentagon officials are preparing new estimates, expected in mid-April, for the projected cost of the jet over the life of the program, factoring in costs to operate and maintain the planes.Current plans call for U.S. orders to ramp up to around 96 jets in fiscal 2019, when Lockheed will be building a 13th batch of jets, according the F-35 program office.Most of the initial partners on the development have already ordered jets, but Canada and Denmark have wavered. Canada is expected to decide this year on whether to proceed with plans to buy 65 F-35s, or launch a fresh competition. Denmark has already launched a competition, but is not expected to announce a decision this year.That gives Lockheed rivals Boeing Co (BA.N), with its F/A-18 Super Hornet, Airbus Group (AIR.PA) and BAE Systems (BAES.L), with their Eurofighter Typhoon, and Sweden's SAAB (SAABb.ST) with its Gripen, another shot at more orders.Italy, which has built a large assembly plant for F-35s, last week said it may halve its plan to buy 90 jets. Italy already cut its orders by 30 percent two years ago to trim state spending during the euro zone debt crisis.Further big cuts could jeopardize the share that Italian firms have in building parts of the F-35m, since industrial participation is tied to the size of a country's orders. Britain is expected to announce an order for 14 more F-35s during a visit by its defense minister to Washington this week. But it is unlikely to add orders at this point, according to sources familiar with the program.South Korea will be the third country, after Israel and Japan, to buy the jets outside the original partnership. Israel is also due to finalize plans for a second batch of F-35 jets this year.Sources familiar with South Korea's plans said Seoul hoped to sign a letter of agreement for its F-35 purchases by August, with the first jets to be delivered in 2018, when Korean pilots will start training at Luke Air Force Base in Arizona.Singapore has also expressed interest in the F-35s. The country's defense minister said in December that Singapore was in no rush to replace its F-16s, but the number of meetings on the issue has increased in recent weeks, said a second source familiar with the F-35 program.Matthew Bates, spokesman for Pratt & Whitney, the United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) unit that builds the F-35's engine, welcomed South Korea's selection and said it demonstrated the program's growing stability.He said the orders would also help lower costs.

The drones will cost about 880 billion won and will be delivered starting 2018, one of the sources said.The defense deals also come as ties between Japan, China and South Korea have chilled over the past year, and the region's three powers look to beef up their defensive capabilities.Seoul's arms procurement agency reported the estimated budget of around 7.34 trillion won to buy the radar-evading F-35s plus support systems to a committee overseeing military purchases earlier on Monday, the second source said.The sources declined to be identified as they were not authorized to speak to media.South Korea says the F-35 deal will be finalized in the third quarter, with the first delivery in 2018. The budget has received the final approval of the finance ministry, Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA) spokesman Baek Youn-hyeong said.Lockheed said in a statement it welcomed South Korea's announcement and it would support discussions between Seoul and Washington to finalize the order this year.South Korea decided to redraw the terms of a 8.3 trillion won tender to buy 60 fighters last year after dropping an option to buy Boeing Co's (BA.N) F-15s in favor of purchasing a fighter with stealth capabilities. In December, Seoul reduced the purchase to an initial 40 jets.""Lockheed Martin agrees ... that the cost of the F-35 is on a downward path that will lead to a Unit Recurring Flyaway (URF) cost for an F-35A of between $80-85 million,"" said Randy Howard, Director of Lockheed Martin's F-35 Korea Business Development in an emailed statement last week.A separate South Korean military source briefed on the buy cautioned that although F-35 flyaway cost is expected to fall between now and first delivery, Lockheed's projections might not fully apply to South Korea as the estimate ""paints a rosy picture"" that appears to presuppose ""the best scenario"" for the progress of the F-35 program. The announcement provided some good news for Lockheed after a spate of critical reports on challenges with software development for the fighter, the emergence of additional bulkhead cracks during long-term durability testing, and news that Italy could further scale back its plans to buy 90 F-35s.Italy had already cut its planned order by 30 percent two years ago.South Korea is the 10th country to make a firm commitment to buy the new Lockheed fighter, joining the United States, Britain, Australia, Norway, Italy, the Netherlands, Japan, Israel and Turkey.Canada and Denmark, which help fund development of the F-35, are still deciding whether to buy F-35s or other fighters. Singapore has also expressed interest in the planes.South Korea was the eighth largest importer of major weapons in the world between 2009 and 2013, with 80 percent of the imports supplied from the United States, according to think tank Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI).

64,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The U.S. Defense Department is poised to approve the first trans-Atlantic flight of Lockheed Martin Corp's F-35 fighter jet in July, when the new warplane is expected to take part in two international air shows near London, according to multiple sources familiar with the issue.U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel is ""very close"" to a decision that would allow two or three F-35s to fly at two British hoes, three sources, who were not authorized to speak publicly, said Tuesday. The shows are the Royal International Air Tattoo, or RIAT, an annual military air show outside London, and the Farnborough air show, held every other year.The international debut of the new U.S. fighter jet will be closely watched by potential buyers, including Canada and Denmark, which helped fund the plane's development but are rethinking their planned procurements.F-35 backers say the decision reflects growing confidence in a program that is about 70 percent over budget and years behind schedule, but skeptics say the plane still faces big challenges, including completing the software needed to integrate weapons on the jet.Britain, which contributed $2 billion to the development of the new radar-evading fighter jet and plans to buy 138 F-35s in coming years, asked for the jet's participation to help showcase the increasing maturity of the new radar-evading plane. Britain was also the first international partner on the program.Details of the F-35's international debut are being worked out, including how much it will cost to fly the planes to London and who will pay for it, but no issues have emerged to prevent the appearances, the sources said.The costs will likely be shared by Britain, the Pentagon's F-35 program office, the U.S. Marine Corps and industry. The Pentagon's F-35 program office said it was evaluating the logistical, security and safety aspects of Britain's request for the jet's participation in both air shows and expected to make a recommendation to senior Pentagon leaders shortly.Lockheed and Britain's Ministry of Defence declined comment.In a separate development, the Pentagon on Tuesday awarded Lockheed $698 million in advanced procurement funding to buy certain long-lead parts and materials needed to build the 57 jets in the ninth production batch, including 34 for the U.S. military, six for Britain, and 17 for other countries. ""Having the aircraft front and center on the UK stage will focus attention on the fact that it's a fairly mature program at this point, with over 100 jets built,"" said one of the sources.BRITISH, U.S. DEFENSE OFFICIALS TO MEET British Defense Secretary Philip Hammond is due to meet with Hagel during a visit to the United States this week, but they are not planning an announcement about the F-35's UK debut, said one of the sources.Current plans call for at least one of the participating F-35s to be one of the three F-35 B-model jets already built for Britain, with a UK pilot at the controls. Participating in the international air shows will allow the Pentagon's F-35 program to carry out additional training and learn how the plane's logistics, maintenance, aerial refueling, and security systems work overseas, the sources said.""This will be an opportunity to learn real-world lessons and allow additional time to resolve any problems before the first airplanes are delivered overseas,"" said one of the sources.Lockheed is the main contractor on the $392 billion F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, the Pentagon's costliest weapons program. Northrop Grumman Corp and Britain's BAE Systems are the biggest suppliers.Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp, builds the single engine that powers the plane.

65,"  WASHINGTON The United States and its allies plan to buy more than 3,100 new F-35 Joint Strike Fighter warplanes in coming years.Following is a list of the planned purchases, according to data provided by Lockheed Martin Corp, the prime contractor for the $392 billion weapons program, and defense officials in the United States and other purchasing countries.Lockheed is developing three variations for the U.S. military services and eight partner countries that helped fund the plane's development - Britain, Australia, Italy, Turkey, the Netherlands, Denmark, Norway and Canada.South Korea this week said it would join the two other countries outside that group, Israel and Japan, that have already placed orders for the jet.The conventional landing A-model will be used by the U.S. Air Force and most allies; the B-model, which can take off from shorter runways and land like a helicopter, will be used by the U.S. Marine Corps, Italy and Britain; and the C-model, or carrier variant, will be used by the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps.U.S. AIR FORCE The U.S. Air Force plans to buy a total of 1,763 F-35 A-models through 2037.The Air Force is training F-35 pilots and technicians at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida, and recently began night training flights at the base. More than 65 pilots and 400 technicians have been qualified to fly and maintain the jet.The Air Force is also flying jets at bases in Nevada and Arizona.U.S. NAVY Current plans call for the U.S. Navy to buy 260 C-model F-35s, which have longer wings and a special tailhook that allows them to land on aircraft carriers. Lockheed and the F-35 program are testing a redesigned tailhook, with at-sea testing expected later this year.U.S. MARINE CORPS The Marine Corps, the smallest of the U.S. military branches plans to buy 340 F-35 B-models and 80 F-35 C-models to replace its current fleet of F/A-18 Hornets, EA-6B Prowlers, and AV-8B Harrier ""jump jets.""The Marines are flying jets at an air base in Arizona, and aim to start using the new F-35Bs by mid-2015. However the Pentagon's chief weapons tester and the congressional Government Accountability Office have said those plans may be delayed by the slow pace of Lockheed's work on the needed software.BRITAIN  Britain's Royal Air Force and Royal Navy, which have invested $2 billion to help develop the new warplane, plan to buy a total of 138 F-35 B-models.Britain has so far committed to buying 48 of the new planes, and is expected to announce plans for the next 14 jets soon. It has already received three jets.ITALY Italy initially planned to buy 131 F-35 fighters, but curtailed its order to 90 jets in 2012. It is now slated to buy 60 F-35A models and 30 F-35Bs, but budget pressures may force another reduction of up to half of the remaining jets.Italy's state-owned defense company Finmeccanica is one of the subcontractors on the project and its Alenia unit will assemble the planes purchased by Italy, the Netherlands and Norway at large facility in northern Italy.NETHERLANDS The Dutch military initially planned to buy 85 F-35As in coming years, but announced in September that it would buy just 37 jets for now, and could has order more later. It has already received two jets that will be used for training, including one that was used for successful lightning testing. TURKEY Turkey is slated to buy 100 F-35As. In February, a senior Turkish official said Turkey would start its orders with two jets in 2015, with deliveries continuing for 10 years.AUSTRALIA Australia is slated to buy 100 F-35As, and has already purchased 2, the first of which is to be delivered later this year.

66,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The U.S. Defense Department is poised to approve the first trans-Atlantic flight of Lockheed Martin Corp's F-35 fighter jet in July, when the new warplane is expected to take part in two international air shows near London, according to multiple sources familiar with the issue.U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel is ""very close"" to a decision that would allow two or three F-35s to fly at the Royal International Air Tattoo, or RIAT, an annual military air show outside London, and the larger Farnborough air show, held every two years, said the sources, who were not authorized to speak publicly.Britain, which contributed $2 billion to the development of the new radar-evading fighter jet and plans to buy 138 F-35s in coming years, asked for the jet's participation to help showcase the increasing maturity of the new radar-evading plane. Britain was also the first international partner on the program.Details of the F-35's international debut are being worked out, including how much it will cost to fly the planes to London and who will pay for it, but no issues have emerged to prevent the appearances, the sources said.The costs will likely be shared by Britain, the Pentagon's F-35 program office, the U.S. Marine Corps and industry. Lockheed and Britain's Ministry of Defense declined comment. Officials at the F-35 program office had no immediate comment.""Having the aircraft front and center on the UK stage will focus attention on the fact that it's a fairly mature program at this point, with over 100 jets built,"" said one of the sources.British Defense Secretary Philip Hammond is due to meet with Hagel during a visit to the United States this week, but they are not planning an announcement about the F-35's UK debut, said one of the sources. Current plans call for at least one of the participating F-35s to be one of the three F-35 B-model jets already built for Britain, with a UK pilot at the controls.Participating in the international air shows will allow the Pentagon's F-35 program to carry out additional training and learn how the plane's logistics, maintenance, aerial refueling, and security systems work overseas, the sources said.""This will be an opportunity to learn real-world lessons and allow additional time to resolve any problems before the first airplanes are delivered overseas,"" said one of the sources.

That is 100 percent competition,"" he said after a hearing held by the House Armed Services Committee's seapower and projection forces subcommittee.Stackley defended the Pentagon's decision to order 90 long-range anti-ship missiles from Lockheed that were developed under a contract with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). He said the move was justified given the urgent needs of military commanders and said the initial DARPA research contract with Lockheed was awarded after a formal competition.""The way to get it out there as quickly as possible is to take this system that DARPA has developed with Lockheed and build a limited number (of air-launched missiles) to get it out into the fleet's hands by the 2018 timeframe,"" he said.Stackley said the decision required a special ""justification and authorization"" by the Pentagon's acquisition chief since it was a sole-source deal and that move had sparked a protest by a rival company.He declined further comment, but said he wanted to make very clear that the larger procurement would be competitively bid. Contract award protests have grown more common in recent years given the shrinking number of new weapons programs available.Raytheon Co has spoken publicly about its concerns about the Pentagon's backing for the Lockheed missile, arguing that its Joint Stand-off Weapons-Extended Range (JSOW-ER) weapon would offer comparable capability at a far lower cost.Stackley said the Navy would follow up on the sole-source deal with Lockheed in coming years with a full competition for surface-launched missiles, but gave no further details. Rear Admiral Mathias Winter, the Navy's program executive officer for unmanned aviation and strike weapons, told Reuters in a separate interview the Navy moved ahead with a sole-source deal for the air-launched missile because of the urgent need.He declined to give any details on the capabilities of the Lockheed missile, but said the goal was to start using the missiles on Air Force B-1 bombers and Navy F/A-18 fighter jets around fiscal 2018 or 2019 under a joint Navy-led program.Current Harpoon missiles and Standoff Land Attack Missile-Expanded Response (SLAM-ER) weapons built by Boeing Co offered a ""formidable"" capability for attacking moving targets today, but future threats required added capabilities, Winter said.Winter said his office was now reviewing an analysis of alternatives completed several years ago and embarking on a thorough feasibility study to map out the requirements for ""Increment 2"" of a next-generation missile in the current constrained budget environment.

All five crew members on board were killed, Air Force spokesman Capt Gerard Galway said. The defence ministry said it had ordered an investigation into the cause of the accident.The aircraft, made by Lockheed Martin Corp, was one of six bought for the air force at a cost of $962 million in 2011. It crashed to the west of the city of Gwalior after taking off at 10 a.m. (0430 GMT) from Agra, home of the famed Taj Mahal monument.

76,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The U.S. military is working closely with Lockheed Martin Corp and other suppliers to lower the per-plane cost of the F-35 fighter jet and improve its reliability, the chief weapons buyer for the U.S. Air Force said in interview on Monday.Assistant Air Force Secretary William LaPlante said the price of the new A-model F-35 is on track to drop from $112 million now to the mid-$80 million range by 2018 or 2019, but the program is developing plans to drive the price even lower.The Government Accountability Office, a congressional watchdog agency, remains skeptical about those efforts, noting that the A-model jets procured in 2013 cost $124.8 million each, about $41 million above the Pentagon's target for 2019.The U.S. military was also focused on improving the reliability of the jets, which are breaking down between flights more often than expected, he said.The F-35 A-model was intended to cost around $50 million per plane, giving the United States and its allies a low-cost way to replace a dozen warplanes now in service. Critics say technical challenges have driven costs higher, which could jeopardize the larger orders needed to achieve lower costs in the longer term. ""There are lots of ideas on how to bring the costs lower,"" LaPlante said. He said the parties were looking at what specific investments could be made by industry and government to lower production costs, but gave no details.The Pentagon is due to unveil a plan with new cost targets for the $392 billion program in early 2014.The GAO on Monday said the program had already lowered the overall cost of developing and buying 2,457 F-35 fighter jets by $11.5 billion or 3.3 percent last year. The Pentagon's own cost projections, due to be sent to Congress in mid-April, are expected to show a similar drop in F-35 costs, sources familiar with the issue said Tuesday.Lockheed is developing three models of the F-35 for the U.S. military and eight countries that helped fund its development: Britain, Australia, Canada, Denmark, Norway, Turkey, Italy and Netherlands. Israel and Japan have also placed orders and South Korea this month announced plans to buy the jet.LaPlante said the Air Force still planned to boost its F-35 orders to around 60 jets a year to achieve economies of scale and drive the cost lower. He said the service made difficult choices in its fiscal 2015 budget and five-year spending plan to protect the ramp up in F-35 production for that reason. ""The operation and sustainment cost is a bigger issue,"" LaPlante said. ""It's the one that will say whether or not we can afford (the F-35)"" in the longer run.The Pentagon's chief weapons tester reported in January that the F-35 fleet was available for use an average of 37 percent of the time from late 2012 to October 2013, far below the minimum threshold of 50 percent and the program's goal of 75 percent. The program is aiming for 60 percent availability by 2015.LaPlante said the effort was looking at which parts were failing more often than expected and making changes there, but improvements would take time to show up in the statistics.""It's going to take a sustained effort,"" he said. ""We're going to be watching this one over the next one to two years.""(Reporting by Andrea Shalal; Editing by Lisa Shumaker and Eric Walsh)",2014-04-01,LMT,"Tue Apr 1, 2014 | 6:21pm EDT","U.S. focuses on cheaper, more reliable F-35 jet: Air Force official",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-lockheed-fighter-idUSBREA3020X20140401?type=companyNews

79,"  (Adds details on separate Austal ship)By Andrea ShalalWASHINGTON, April 1 Both the Lockheed Martin Corp and Austal versions of the U.S. Navy's new coastal warship performed well in a major war game last week and surprised some ""enemies"" with their capabilities, a top Navy admiral said on Tuesday.Rear Admiral Thomas Rowden, director of surface warfare for the Navy, said the war game held at the U.S. Naval War College in Rhode Island underscored the effectiveness of the new smaller warships in potential future conflicts, even in deeper waters.""This is going to be a force to be reckoned with,"" Rowden told reporters on a teleconference, noting that U.S. Navy officials went home after the weeklong exercises with a new appreciation for the Navy's newest class of warships.""The LCS represents a new tool in the tool box,"" he added. The war game was planned long before Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel ordered the Navy to reassess its plans to buy 52 of the new smaller warships, and launch a study on what it would take to make give the ships better protection and more firepower.A small group of military officials is studying the issue in a secluded office outside the Pentagon, with results due back by July 31 in time to inform the fiscal 2016 budget debate.A Navy task force is studying options for meeting a requirement for 52 small surface combatants, including buying more of the current LCS ships, modifying them, or switching to a new design, all with a focus on affordability. A separate advisory group, chaired by Rowden and Allison Stiller, deputy assistant secretary of Navy for ships, is also looking at the issue.Rowden said pairing the smaller Littoral Combat Ships (LCS) with larger guided missile destroyers increased their ability to survive enemy attacks and sharply increased the Navy's ability to hunt for enemy submarines.Rowden said the LCS ships were ""played"" using a new missile with a 120-mile (193-km) range that officials believe will be available for use on the ships in the mid-2020s. Navy officials were also able to ""confuse the enemy"" by using Joint High Speed Vessels, smaller U.S. ships also built by Australia's Austal, to supply the LCS ships and move them around the shallow waters of the western Pacific region, he said.He said the war game - which involved 32 LCS ships and a broad range of other ships, fighter jets and other U.S. military equipment - showed how changing the concept of operations to pair up ships during a battle could be an affordable alternative to adding air defense equipment to the LCS ships.The ability of the LCS ships to switch equipment and take on new missions, or modularity, proved helpful in some circumstances during the game, Rowden said.Over 800 pages of notes from the war game will be analyzed over the next two months with conclusions likely to be released in mid- to late May, Rowden told reporters.He said Austal's aluminum trimaran LCS design had ""a little bit longer legs"" and proved more advantageous on the open ocean, while Lockheed's steel monohull design was more effective in areas closer to shore.

80,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON, April 2  WASHINGTON, April 2 U.S. senators on Wednesday urged the Air Force to allow more competition in the multibillion-dollar market for launching government satellites, citing rising costs and concerns about Russian-made engines that power some of the U.S. rockets.Lawmakers said the Air Force's budget plan for fiscal 2015 reduced opportunities for privately held Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX) and others to gain a foothold in a program now dominated by the two biggest U.S. weapons makers, Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing Co.Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein told Air Force officials it was ""unacceptable"" to reduce competition while the cost of the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) program were rising sharply.""I'm worried about the costs going up exponentially,"" she told a hearing of the Senate Appropriations Committee's defense subcommittee.Feinstein and five other senators also sent a letter to Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel urging him to ensure that the launch program allowed competition in fiscal 2015 as planned.The congressional Government Accountability Office this week said the cost of each new launch had more than tripled to $420 million as of August 2013, and the total cost of the program was now projected to reach $70 billion. Allowing other companies to compete for the launches could also help resolve growing concerns about a Russian engine used to power the Atlas V launcher built by the Lockheed-Boeing venture, the United Launch Alliance, senators said.Democratic Senator Richard Durbin, who heads the defense subcommittee, said the Air Force's budget request diminished opportunities for competition and continued to favor the Lockheed-Boeing venture, despite concerns about the Russian-made engines.U.S. dependence on Russian engines has long been a concern of U.S. lawmakers, but those worries have been heightened after Russia's seizure of Crimea, an autonomous region in Ukraine. Air Force Secretary Deborah James told the committee she also found the reliance on Russian engines ""worrisome"" and expected Air Force officials to complete a study of the issue by late May that would look at alternatives such as possible U.S. production of the motors, and the likely cost.Air Force Chief of Staff General Mark Welsh said current rough estimates showed it would take about five years and $1 billion to start building the engines in the United States.Both Welsh and James said the Air Force is committed to opening the launch market to competition, but said new market entrants needed to prove they could safely launch sensitive military and intelligence satellites. James told senators the Air Force was not trying to avoid competition by postponing orders for some rocket launches until after fiscal 2019. She said the launches were simply not needed at the moment since U.S. global positioning satellites were lasting longer on orbit than expected.She also questioned the GAO's cost estimate for the program, and said it may not have factored in savings the Air Force says it is getting by ordering launches in bulk.She said the Air Force remained committed to competition, and expected SpaceX to be certified to compete for certain launches of lighter satellites by the end of 2014, with qualification for heavier launches to follow by 2017.""It had nothing to do with locking someone out of competition,"" she said. ""The quicker we can get other companies qualified to compete, the better.""Allison Bryan, a spokeswoman for SpaceX, welcomed the senators' letter to Hagel. ""Increasing fair competition in the EELV program is a smart decision that would not only improve efficiency and optimize budgets, but also eliminate America's reliance on Russian-made engines which, in light of the crisis in Ukraine, is a direct threat to our nation's security.""

The comments revealed continuing friction between the program office that runs the Pentagon's costliest weapons program and Pratt at a time when the F-35 program chief, Air Force Lieutenant General Chris Bogdan has talked about improved relations with Lockheed, the prime contractor that builds the airplane.In 2012, Bogdan described relations between Lockheed, Pratt and the government as the worst he had seen in two decades of working on acquisition programs.Pratt said it had invested $60 million in ""a very aggressive"" cost-cutting program that had already lowered the cost of the F135 engine by 40 percent. ""We are pursuing cost reductions in every aspect of the program, including supply chain, configuration changes, process improvements, and overhead,"" said Pratt spokesman Matthew Bates. He said procurement delays affected costs.Mahr said the government was close to reaching agreement with Pratt on a seventh batch of engines for the new warplane that is being developed for the U.S. military and its allies, but declined to comment on the exact timing of a deal.Bates said the company hoped to wrap up the negotiations by the end of the second quarter. The Pentagon finalized a contract worth $1.1 billion for 38 engines in a sixth batch last October, which pushed the cost of the common configuration engine built for the Air Force and Navy models down by 2.5 percent. It did not provide the exact cost.Mahr said lawyers from the Pentagon's F-35 office were also in talks with Pratt to publicly release details on the cost of the engine, which the government buys separately from the jet.Pratt argues it should not be required to disclose details about the costs of the engine or spare parts, since that could affect the company's ability to compete in a next-generation engine procurement that the Pentagon is kick-starting with a new $1 billion technology demonstration program.Bates said other companies that built sole source military engines had successfully argued against releasing pricing data for such competition reasons in the past.Mahr said the overall F-35 program is making steady progress, although he said some technical issues still needed to be to resolved, including improving the performance of a complex computer-based logistics system called ALIS, and a recent crack in a fan blade on a Pratt engine. The Pentagon was also pressing the industry to lower the cost of building and operating the new jet, and making it more reliable, he said.

89,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The U.S. Navy hopes to smooth out the impact on Lockheed Martin Corp and Australia's Austal of a budget-driven decision to order three Littoral Combat Ships instead of four in fiscal year 2015, the Navy's top weapons buyer said on Thursday.The Navy had planned to buy two of each of the different small warships built by Lockheed and Austal in fiscal 2015 and 2016, but it scaled back those orders to three ships a year as a result of budget cuts mandated by Congress.Assistant Navy Secretary Sean Stackley told members of the Senate Armed Services Committee's seapower subcommittee that Navy officials would now meet with both companies, and evaluate their schedules, material purchases, expenditures and performance before deciding how to divvy up the orders this year.""What we are striving for is an outcome that has zero impact to either builder and the vendor base,"" Stackley told reporters after the hearing. ""We're going to arrive at what we think is the best outcome between the two builders and the split of ships between 2015 and 2016,"" he told reporters.Stackley said the decrease in orders for 2015 would have some effect on the cost of the ships, but the Navy hoped to minimize that impact by working closely with the shipbuilders. The Pentagon is reassessing the $34 billion Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) program and whether to buy all 52 of the fast, agile warships planned, or whether to modify the designs to give the ships more firepower and increase their ability to survive.Stackley said he was confident that the Navy's orders for the ship orders could be timed to maintain both shipyard's production schedules, but he was less confident about smaller vendors that provide materials to the larger contractors.Both companies are under contract to build a total of 10 ships for the Navy, and the final four ships were to be ordered in fiscal 2015, bringing the total built to 24. Stackley said the contracts were contingent on the availability of funding from Congress, but any changes to the contracts would require bilateral agreements, he said.In addition to the budget cuts, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel has ordered the Navy to halt orders for the smaller, more agile warships after 32 ships, and to study ways to better protect the ships and give them more firepower.A high-level Navy task force is to deliver recommendations on the issue by July 31, in time to inform the Navy's fiscal 2016 budget deliberations, Stackley told the committee. Senator John McCain, a senior Republican on the committee who has urged the Navy to halt the LCS program after 24 ships, renewed his criticism of the program at the hearing on Thursday.Stackley acknowledged the program encountered sharp cost increases shortly after it began in 2005 but said that was largely due to changes in Navy requirements. He said costs were now far below congressional cost caps, and development was progressing on separate interchangeable equipment packages.Stackley said the ship had some ability to protect itself, but would generally be deployed together with other ships that could provide greater protection against airborne threats.He said the ships were also far more ""survivable"" than the mine-hunting ships they were replacing, which had no self-defense capability.(Reporting by Andrea Shalal; Editing by Ken Wills)",2014-04-10,LMT,"Thu Apr 10, 2014 | 7:58pm EDT",U.S. Navy aims to smooth impact of fiscal 2015 cut to ship orders,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-navy-ships-lockheed-austal-idUSBREA3929L20140410?type=companyNews

97,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The Pentagon on Tuesday detailed $48.3 billion in cuts to major weapons programs like Lockheed Martin Corp's F-35 fighter jet that would kick in from fiscal 2016 to 2019 if Congress does not reverse automatic budget cuts that are to resume in 2016.It said the cuts would slash $40 billion from the Pentagon's planned spending on operations and maintenance over that time, while research and development of new cutting-edge technologies would fall by nearly $18 billion from $337 billion.The Defense Department said the cuts required under a process called sequestration would damage the military's modernization efforts, increase national security risks, further slash troop levels and jeopardize the ability of U.S. forces to go to war.""If sequestration-level cuts persist, our forces will assume substantial additional risks in certain missions and will continue to face significant readiness and modernization challenges,"" the Pentagon said in the report.It said the cuts would leave the military unbalanced and eventually too small to meet the needs of the Obama administration's military strategy.

102,"  (Adds comments from minister, lists Lockheed competitors, adds background from paragraph 4)By Randall PalmerOTTAWA, April 17 The Canadian government will take several more weeks to evaluate its options for the much-delayed replacement of the country's CF-18 fighter jets, Public Works Minister Diane Finley said on Thursday.The decision boils down to whether to proceed with a single-source contract to Lockheed Martin Corp for 65 F-35 stealth fighters or to go with a tender that opens up the bidding to competitors.The Conservative government ran into a storm of criticism over its decision in 2010 to go with the F-35s without an open tender. It then froze that decision and has been talking to other aircraft makers as well.""Over the next several weeks we will be carefully reviewing a number of reports relating to the evaluation of options, industrial benefits, costs and other factors related to the decision to replace our CF-18 fleet,"" Finley said in the prepared text of a speech she was giving in British Columbia. Lockheed Martin and three other companies have filled out initial reports, something short of formal bids, to the government on the capabilities and costs of their aircraft:- Boeing Co, which makes the F-18 Super Hornet- Dassault Aviation, which makes the Rafale - The Eurofighter Typhoon consortium, which includes BAE Systems , Airbus Group and Italy's Finmeccanica.The Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) evaluated the different fighters under the eye of an independent panel of experts, which Finley said ensures that the RCAF's review was ""both rigorous and impartial"".Cabinet ministers including Finley and Defence Minister Rob Nicholson will now consider how to proceed. ""Let me say, first and foremost, that in our consideration of the work that has been done by the RCAF and the panel, we will ensure that the Canadian Forces have the equipment that they need to do the work that we ask of them,"" Finley said.The question of what the military needs is delicate. The main reason the government had opted for the F-35s without an open competition was that the air force had determined that fifth-generation stealth capabilities were crucial and that only the F-35 had them.That assumption is now being reexamined, and the independent review panel even asked the government to include as one of its options a further extension of the life of the CF-18s, which were brought into service in the 1980s.Ottawa has set aside C$9 billion ($8.2 billion) to buy the new jets, and had said it would cost a further C$16 billion to operate and maintain the F-35s over 20 years. Auditor General Michael Ferguson said in a scathing report in April 2012 that officials had downplayed the full life-cycle costs of the planes.($1=$1.10 Canadian)   (Editing by Peter Galloway)",2014-04-17,LMT,"Thu Apr 17, 2014 | 1:26pm EDT",UPDATE 1-Canada to evaluate fighter-jet options over next several weeks,http://www.reuters.com//article/canada-military-jets-idUSL2N0N916N20140417?type=companyNews

104,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON, April 22  WASHINGTON, April 22 Lockheed Martin Corp  warned on Tuesday that the U.S. Navy's plan to cancel an order for 29 MH-60 helicopters built by Lockheed and Sikorsky Aircraft would result in large termination fees because they are part of five-year agreements signed in 2012.Lockheed Chief Financial Officer Bruce Tanner told reporters that work had already begun on cockpits and other equipment for the helicopters, which were to be ordered in fiscal year 2016, and a better option might be to finish building the aircraft and then sell them to allies.""That would probably be a better deal for the taxpayer than paying close to 100 percent and not getting anything for it,"" he said. ""The cost to terminate partially built helicopters is pretty significant relative to the cost to actually finish those helicopters.""Tanner did not provide details on the size of the expected termination fee if the Navy proceeds with its plan to ""break"" its five-year contracts with both Lockheed, which integrates the radars, cockpit and other equipment on the helicopters, and Sikorsky, the United Technologies Corp unit which builds the aircraft. The Navy uses the helicopters to hunt for submarines and attack surface ships, relaying information to parent ships using onboard data links.U.S. Navy officials have said they are working closely with the companies and senior Pentagon leaders to understand the cost of cancelling the final 29 Navy helicopters covered by the agreements, but the process has not yet been completed.They said the aircraft cuts were linked to lack of funding for the refueling of a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, but would be revisited if Congress restored funding for the work on the carrier. The Navy's fiscal 2015 budget and five-year spending plan omitted funding for 29 MH-60 helicopters and other key weapons programs in fiscal 2016, when automatic budget cuts required under sequestration are due to resume.Tim Healy, who heads maritime programs for Sikorsky, this month said any move by the Navy to break the agreements in fiscal 2016 could undermine the industry's willingness to sign such cost-saving agreements in the future, and would likely raise the cost of 60 U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopters that are part of the deal. The cuts would also affect a host of companies that supply components used to build the helicopters. Sikorsky signed an $8.5 billion contract with the Army and Navy in July 2012 to buy 653 Black Hawk and Seahawk helicopters through December 2017, a deal that generated significant discounts given the large size of the order.Lockheed signed a $1.02 billion five-year contract in April 2012 to build new cockpits and other equipment for the aircraft.Sikorsky is due to deliver the last of 24 helicopters being built for Australia in early 2016, and nine helicopters being built for the Danish navy in 2017, said spokesman Frans Jurgens.He said the company would accelerate work on the Danish helicopters and complete them a year ahead of schedule if the Navy did not reverse its proposed cuts.

The 58 F-35 aircraft, in addition to 14 already approved in 2009, will provide the Royal Australian Air Force with enough aircraft to form three operational squadrons and one training squadron, the Canberra source said.Australia was also also considering acquiring an additional squadron of F-35 aircraft to replace its fleet of Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet fighter aircraft, the source said. Lockheed is currently negotiating a contract for an eighth batch of jets with the U.S. Pentagon that does not include the latest strike fighters for Australia.Those jets would be part of a ninth or tenth batch to be ordered next year and the year after.

106,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N), the Pentagon's largest supplier, on Tuesday reported a 23 percent jump in net profit in the first quarter and raised its earnings per share outlook for the full year by 25 cents.But Lockheed, maker of the F-35 fighter jet, satellites and coastal warships, said U.S. government budget cuts continued to depress revenue this year, with sales to the U.S. military likely to drop by 6.0 percent in 2014 after a 4.0 percent drop in 2013.Chief Financial Officer Bruce Tanner told reporters on Tuesday that the lost revenue amounted to ""a pretty significant"" 10 percent drop over two years, which has reversed the company's expectation that 2014 would be a growth year.Earnings and cash flow from operations remained strong, and foreign sales offset the drop in U.S. orders, he said.The company reported net earnings of $933 million for the quarter, or $2.87 per share, up from $761 million, or $2.33 per share, in the first quarter of 2013.Operating margins reached 13.4 percent in the first quarter, well above the 12.1 percent rate seen a year earlier and matching an earlier record, but Tanner said it would be challenging to maintain that level in coming years.""That's a hard hurdle for us to maintain and especially in the near term,"" Tanner told analysts during a separate call. ""With the significant growth coming on the F-35 program at lower than the overall margin rate, that's clearly going to put pressure on our ability to achieve that."" Lockheed shares were down 1.7 percent at $158.69 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.Rob Stallard, with RBC Capital Markets, said Lockheed's earnings and operating margins beat expectations, but investors were beginning to wonder how much longer the company could maintain that performance given declining revenues.Lockheed forecast earnings per share of $10.50 to $10.80 for the full year, up 25 cents from its guidance in January, and affirmed its sales forecast of $41.5 billion to $43 billion.Revenues fell 4.0 percent compared to the first quarter of 2013, with only one of five business segments - aeronautics - reporting higher sales, as deficit-reducing measures began to take a toll on military spending. The aeronautics sector, which includes F-35 and C-130 cargo planes, reported revenues of $3.39 billion for the quarter, a 6.0 percent increase from a year earlier.Tanner said international sales helped offset the decline in U.S. orders in the first quarter and would account for about 20 percent of full year revenues in 2014, up from 17 percent the previous two years.He said Lockheed expected more orders for the F-35 fighter jet, the company's single biggest program, from Australia, South Korea, Israel and Singapore, but not this year. ""I think we're on the cusp of closing some fairly good-sized orders in the not-too-distant future, but I don't think they're necessarily going to close in 2014,"" Tanner said. ""These things are going to take some time to manifest themselves in terms of translating into an actual contract award.""He said the F-35 would account for 25 percent of overall revenues by 2018 or 2019, when the program reaches full rate production.Tanner said Lockheed was also in talks with potential customers in the Middle East about a variant of the small warship it builds for the U.S. Navy, but did not expect any of those talks to result in a firm contract in 2014 either.Bookings would likely total about $10 billion each in the next two quarters and $16 billion in the fourth quarter, reaching just over $80 billion in the full year.Higher pension income of $86 million in the first quarter also helped boost earnings, a big swing from the $121 million pension expense seen a year earlier, Lockheed said.Tanner attributed the difference to an increase in interest rates that changed the discount rate used to calculate Lockheed's pension liabilities at the end of last year, and resulted in a significant reduction that would continue throughout the year.(Reporting by Andrea Shalal; Editing by Stephen Coates and Leslie Adler)",2014-04-22,LMT,"Tue Apr 22, 2014 | 2:22pm EDT","Lockheed lifts outlook as profit rises, but revenue falls",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-lockheed-martin-results-idUSBREA3L0MA20140422?type=companyNews

""These things are going to take some time to manifest themselves in terms of translating into an actual contract award.""He said the F-35 would account for 25 percent of overall revenues by 2018 or 2019, when the program reaches full rate production.Tanner said Lockheed was also in talks with potential customers in the Middle East about a variant of the small warship it builds for the U.S. Navy, but did not expect any of those talks to result in a firm contract in 2014 either.Bookings would likely total about $10 billion each in the next two quarters and $16 billion in the fourth quarter, reaching just over $80 billion in the full year.Higher pension income of $86 million in the first quarter also helped boost earnings, a big swing from the $121 million pension expense seen a year earlier, Lockheed said.Tanner attributed the difference to an increase in interest rates that changed the discount rate used to calculate Lockheed's pension liabilities at the end of last year, and resulted in a significant reduction that would continue throughout the year.

114,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON, April 23  WASHINGTON, April 23 Australia's decision to order 58 more F-35 fighter jets built by Lockheed Martin Corp  by 2023 will help drive down the cost of the stealthy warplane and strengthen the jet's presence in Asia, a senior Lockheed official said on Wednesday.Steve O'Bryan, Lockheed's vice president for F-35 business development, said 10 countries had now committed to buying the F-35, and Lockheed expected others to follow suit this year.Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott announced Wednesday that his country would spend A$12.4 billion ($11.61 billion) to buy 58 more F-35s, bringing its total order to 72 jets, including 14 F-35s already ordered in 2009.Lockheed is building three models of the F-35 for the U.S. military and nine other countries that have placed orders or announced plans to buy: Britain, Australia, Norway, Italy, Turkey, the Netherlands, Israel, Japan and South Korea.Canada and Denmark helped fund the plane's development and remain part of the initial partnership, but they are reassessing their fighter procurement plans. Singapore is also expected to order F-35 jets, although the timing remains uncertain.""Australia's decision is another affirmation for the program,"" O'Bryan told reporters during a teleconference. ""That will add a significant amount of quantity into those near-term years, driving down the price ... of the airplane."" The Pentagon last week released a revised estimate for the cost of the 2,443 planes to be purchased by the U.S. military that showed a 1.9 percent increase.U.S. Air Force Lieutenant Chris Bogdan, the Pentagon's F-35 program chief, said additional orders would drive down the cost, which had increased largely due to budget-driven delays in orders by the Pentagon and other allies.O'Bryan said quantity was the single biggest factor driving cost reductions on the aircraft, so any additional orders would help lower the projected procurement cost. He said Lockheed was working closely with the Pentagon and engine maker Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp , to drive down the cost of operating the plane.Lockheed is also investing its own money to generate future savings by making it easer to build, maintain and operate the jets, including efforts to reduce the weight of the aircraft, which would have a significant effect on its fuel usage rates.O'Bryan said Lockheed expected additional countries to join the program this year, but declined to elaborate which ones. Asked if Singapore was likely to order jets this year, he said only that Singapore was evaluating the jet and Lockheed stood ready to support Singapore when it completed that process.He said the jet would be operated throughout Asia by Japan, South Korea, Australia and three U.S. military services, which would result in lower operating and maintenance costs for all the allies since they could share sustainment facilities.Canada was going through a thorough and transparent seven-step process as it decided whether to proceed with its planned F-35 purchases, or launch a new competition, he said.O'Bryan also Australian suppliers would now be able to compete for billions of dollars of additional work on the aircraft, topping even Australia's estimate that its companies would get $1.5 billion in orders as a result of the new order.""We're highly confident that we will exceed the value of $1.5 bln in contracts that the Australian government talked about,"" he said.

117,"   By Matt Siegel and Andrea Shalal | SYDNEY/WASHINGTON  SYDNEY/WASHINGTON Australia will order 58 more F-35 fighter jets built by Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) for A$12.4 billion ($11.61 billion), Prime Minister Tony Abbott said on Wednesday, a purchase that will raise its air combat power to among the world's most advanced.Australia approved the purchase of 14 of the stealth fighters in 2009, and the additional jets will provide the Royal Australian Air Force with enough aircraft to form three operational squadrons and one training squadron.The first F-35 aircraft will arrive in Australia in 2018 and enter service with the RAAF in 2020, Abbott said.""The fifth-generation F-35 is the most advanced fighter in production anywhere in the world and will make a vital contribution to our national security,"" he told reporters in Canberra.The Australian purchase is a signal of confidence in the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program, which is about 70 percent over budget and years behind schedule.The program, the Pentagon's most expensive arms development project, has been plagued by technical issues and skeptics say it still faces big challenges, including completing the software needed to integrate weapons on the jet.Its total cost is now seen at $1.42 trillion, including research, development, procurement and operations through 2065. The Pentagon last week released a revised estimate for the cost of the 2,443 planes to be purchased by the U.S. military that showed a 1.9 percent increase.Air Force Lieutenant Chris Bodgan, who runs the program for the Pentagon, said the increase was largely due to budget-driven delays in orders by the Pentagon and other allies. Additional orders would help drive the cost down, he said.Lockheed is building three models of the F-35 for the U.S. military and eight countries that helped fund its development: Britain, Canada, Australia, Norway, Italy, Turkey, the Netherlands and Denmark.Israel and Japan have also placed orders, and South Korea has said it plans to buy the plane as well. AUSTRALIA'S LAST MANNED FIGHTER Despite concerns about the program, Abbott said Australia was considering acquiring an additional squadron of the jets to replace its fleet of Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet fighters.Australia has moved recently to upgrade its air defense capabilities, announcing in February that it would buy eight of Boeing Co's (BA.N) P-8A Poseidon long-range spy planes for A$4 billion and committing in March to purchasing the U.S. Navy's MQ-4C Triton unmanned aircraft.Abbott defended the latest purchase ahead of the release next month of what is expected to be a very tight federal budget due to a significant revenue shortfall. ""This is not new spending today, in the context of a tough budget, this is spending money that we need to spend that has been sensibly put aside in the past to ensure that our nation's defenses remain strong,"" he said.The fighter will allow for greater interoperability with the United States and other allies, as well as boosting communications between Australia's different branches of service, said James Brown, a military analyst with the Lowy Institute.The purchase deepened his concerns, however, that Australia was falling behind the rest of the world when it comes to the development and deployment in combat of unmanned aircraft, or drones.""I think we need to now seriously ask the question about whether this is the last manned fighter jet Australia will purchase,"" he told Reuters.""My main concern in terms of where Air Force is going is that we're not thinking seriously enough about the next aircraft after JSF being unmanned.""($1 = 1.0677 Australian Dollars)(Additional reporting by Sonali Paul in Melbourne; Editing by Stephen Coates)",2014-04-23,LMT,"Tue Apr 22, 2014 | 11:32pm EDT",Australia orders 58 F-35 Lockheed Martin stealth fighters,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-australia-lockheed-fighter-idUSBREA3M05H20140423?type=companyNews
118,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) warned on Tuesday that the U.S. Navy's plan to cancel an order for 29 MH-60 helicopters built by Lockheed and Sikorsky Aircraft would result in large termination fees because they are part of five-year agreements signed in 2012.Lockheed Chief Financial Officer Bruce Tanner told reporters that work had already begun on cockpits and other equipment for the helicopters, which were to be ordered in fiscal year 2016, and a better option might be to finish building the aircraft and then sell them to allies.""That would probably be a better deal for the taxpayer than paying close to 100 percent and not getting anything for it,"" he said. ""The cost to terminate partially built helicopters is pretty significant relative to the cost to actually finish those helicopters.""Tanner did not provide details on the size of the expected termination fee if the Navy proceeds with its plan to ""break"" its five-year contracts with both Lockheed, which integrates the radars, cockpit and other equipment on the helicopters, and Sikorsky, the United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) unit which builds the aircraft.The Navy uses the helicopters to hunt for submarines and attack surface ships, relaying information to parent ships using onboard data links. U.S. Navy officials have said they are working closely with the companies and senior Pentagon leaders to understand the cost of cancelling the final 29 Navy helicopters covered by the agreements, but the process has not yet been completed.They said the aircraft cuts were linked to lack of funding for the refueling of a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, but would be revisited if Congress restored funding for the work on the carrier. The Navy's fiscal 2015 budget and five-year spending plan omitted funding for 29 MH-60 helicopters and other key weapons programs in fiscal 2016, when automatic budget cuts required under sequestration are due to resume.Tim Healy, who heads maritime programs for Sikorsky, this month said any move by the Navy to break the agreements in fiscal 2016 could undermine the industry's willingness to sign such cost-saving agreements in the future, and would likely raise the cost of 60 U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopters that are part of the deal. The cuts would also affect a host of companies that supply components used to build the helicopters.Sikorsky signed an $8.5 billion contract with the Army and Navy in July 2012 to buy 653 Black Hawk and Seahawk helicopters through December 2017, a deal that generated significant discounts given the large size of the order. Lockheed signed a $1.02 billion five-year contract in April 2012 to build new cockpits and other equipment for the aircraft.Sikorsky is due to deliver the last of 24 helicopters being built for Australia in early 2016, and nine helicopters being built for the Danish navy in 2017, said spokesman Frans Jurgens.He said the company would accelerate work on the Danish helicopters and complete them a year ahead of schedule if the Navy did not reverse its proposed cuts.(Reporting by Andrea Shalal)",2014-04-23,LMT,"Tue Apr 22, 2014 | 8:01pm EDT",Lockheed says costly for Pentagon if it cancels MH-60 helicopters,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-lockheed-martin-helicopter-idUSBREA3M00320140423?type=companyNews
119,"   By Supriya Kurane  May 1 A U.S. Court of Federal Claims judge issued an injunction late Wednesday prohibiting a joint venture between Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing from proceeding with plans to buy Russian-made rocket engines used to send U.S. Air Force satellites into space.Space Exploration Technologies, the privately held company known as SpaceX, won the temporary injunction against the U.S. government and contractors Boeing and Lockheed operating as United Launch Alliance.The U.S. Air Force and United Launch Alliance are prohibited ""from making any purchases from or payment of money to NPO Energomash"", Federal Claims Court Judge Susan Braden wrote in the order. The preliminary injunction does not extend to any purchase orders placed or money paid to Russian rocket engine maker NPO Energomash prior to the date of the order.Lawmakers on Wednesday called for a program to develop a next-generation liquid-fuel rocket engine within five years, proposing legislation aimed at reducing U.S. dependence on Russian engines to launch military and spy satellites. Moscow's annexation of neighbour Ukraine's Crimea region and the massing of Russian troops near the border have left East-West relations more tense than at any time since the Cold War.SpaceX, which manufactures and launches rockets and spacecraft, last week filed a lawsuit to protest the Air Force's award of a multibillion-dollar, non-compete contract for 36 rocket launches to a partnership of the two biggest U.S. weapons makers. The company wants the Air Force to reverse the sole-source award of 36 boosters to United Launch Alliance and open the procurement to commercial competition.United Launch Alliance, the U.S. Air Force and NPO Energomash were not available for immediate comment.SpaceX, co-founded by investor Elon Musk who also heads electric car company Tesla, says its rockets are U.S. made.

The ruling also banned sales to any entities associated with Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin, who is among the individuals subject to U.S. sanctions in protest of Russia's invasion of Ukraine's Crimea peninsula. The injunction, however, does not impact purchases made before the April 30 ruling, Braden's law clerk Chris McCall wrote in an email on Friday to the Justice Department, which had asked for a clarification of the order.Both United Launch Services, a holding company of United Launch Alliance, and privately owned SpaceX, filed responses to the Justice Department's request that Braden clarify her order.""There is … no need whatsoever to broaden the scope of the injunction. Doing so would needlessly bring all payments under ULS's contract to a halt, damaging a key national security program and inflicting irreparable harm both on ULS and a universe of U.S. suppliers and businesses that support it,"" ULS attorney Jason Carey wrote on Monday. On Tuesday, Braden declined the request for clarification, clearing the government to continue doing business with United Launch Alliance.ULS said it has enough RD-180 engines previously ordered or in stock to meet the military's launch needs for two years and is looking into possible domestic production.

Polish Deputy Defense Minister Czeslaw Mroczek told Reuters in March that the country wanted to choose a winner by the end of the year, which already marked an acceleration from its initial plan to buy a new missile defense system in 2015.President Barack Obama is due to visit Poland in June as part of a trip that will take him to a G7 summit in Brussels and to France for the 70th anniversary of the D-Day invasion.There are four bidders in the Polish tender: France's Thales , in a consortium with European group MBDA and the Polish state defence group; the Israeli government; Raytheon Co , and the MEADS consortium led by Lockheed. MEADS has estimated the tender is worth about $5 billion, but experts say the whole missile defense system could be worth as much as 40 billion zlotys ($13 billion), including maintenance costs. It is to be completed by the end of 2022.The crisis over Ukraine has deeply unsettled officials in Poland, which fell under Soviet domination after World War Two, but was one of the first countries to shake off Communist rule in 1989.NATO's top military commander this month said the alliance must consider permanently stationing troops in parts of Eastern Europe as a result of the increased tension. Coyne said Lockheed remained convinced the MEADS offer would give Poland the best value: a new missile defense system with 360-degree coverage, and partnership with Italy and Germany, which developed MEADS together with the United States.The MEADS offer also includes construction of a third plant in Poland to build baseline PAC-3 missiles, besides existing sites in Arkansas and Japan. Coyne said the new plant could then be used to upgrade and recertify 1,000-plus of the PAC-3 missiles already in use by seven countries.Lockheed also offered to help Poland develop its own long-range missile, which could be fired by the MEADS system against less complex targets like aircraft, Coyne said.Raytheon, which is the prime contractor for the Patriot missile defense system, argues that Poland should join 12 other countries that are using it. The company says the Patriot system has been heavily modernized to include new digital processors, touch panel screens and portable trainers.Critics of MEADS say it has not been tested in combat, while the Patriot system has demonstrated it can fire the PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement (MSE) missiles developed for MEADS.

133,"   By Andrea Shalal | LITTLETON, Colorado  LITTLETON, Colorado Lockheed Martin Corp has begun final assembly of a new U.S. weather satellite that will allow the U.S. government to provide far earlier warnings about potentially deadly tornadoes and solar flares when it is launched in early 2016.Lockheed this week powered on a key part of the satellite for the first time in a special ""clean room"" at a sprawling facility south of Denver, where engineers are assembling the satellite and testing components before the whole spacecraft moves to environmental and thermal vacuum testing in July.The company won a $1.09 billion contract in 2009 to build two 30-foot, 14,000-pound Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite R-Series (GOES-R) satellites for NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which have since exercised options for two additional satellites.The first of the new satellites is on track for delivery to the government by October 2015, followed by launch into geosynchronous orbit about 35,000 km (22,300 mi) above the Earth in early 2016, Steve Jolly, chief engineer for the GOES-R program, told Reuters during the first media tour of the cavernous ""high-bay"" room where the satellite is being built. To minimize any debris, visitors and workers wear special coveralls, head bonnets and slippers over their shoes, while fans blow air down through the room to reduce the possibility that even a stray bit of dust could harm the performance of the sophisticated cameras on board once they get out to space.The GEOS-R satellites are being assembled at a Lockheed facility tucked away in a canyon south of Denver where the company built the nation's first intercontinental ballistic missile in 1955, and continues to work on a range of other military and intelligence satellites today.Engineers are now using small portable computers and large flat screens for testing the satellite, said Mike Ingalls, who heads the systems integration and testing for the satellite. Jolly said the new satellite would give the government revolutionary new weather forecasting capabilities, offering imagery with four times better resolution and five times more data. ""It's just phenomenal,"" Jolly said. ""It can scan the entire (western) hemisphere in five minutes.""Using a new lightning tracker, also built by Lockheed, the satellite will be able to predict formation of tornadoes up to 20 minutes sooner than currently possible, Jolly said, adding, ""Twenty minutes can be a matter of life or death."" The new satellite is based on Lockheed's A2100 spacecraft, which is also used for commercial communications satellites.The satellite also includes a new sensor that will monitor solar activity in ultraviolet wavelengths, helping predict potentially disruptive solar flares and other ""space weather.""The GOES system has been in use by the United States for 40 years.

He also said ULA could provide additional lighter-weight launches for under $100 million, about the same price that SpaceX says its rocket launches will cost.Overall, he said, the 36-launch contract had saved the U.S. government about $4 billion.SpaceX last month sued the Air Force to protest the award of a multibillion-dollar, non-compete contract to ULA for 36 rocket launches, saying the deal blocked companies like SpaceX from competing for national security launches. The Air Force says it will allow SpaceX to compete for a small number of rocket launch orders once its Falcon 9 rocket is certified to launch military satellites into space.Gass said there were ""a lot of rumors and innuendo"" about the cost of his company's rocket launch services, but the $460 million cost estimate was inaccurate and actually included some funding being used to certify the new SpaceX rocket.SpaceX Falcon 9 rockets already fly cargo ships to the International Space Station, a $100 billion research laboratory that flies about 260 miles (418 km) above Earth. The Falcon 9 also launches commercial communications satellites into high-altitude orbits.

The SpaceX lawsuit comes amid growing concern about ULA's use of Russian-made RD-180 engines for its Atlas rockets at a time when Russia is facing sanctions for its annexation of Ukraine's Crimean peninsula.Gass said Moscow had not informed the company, or its Russian supplier, about any plans to halt shipments of the RD-180 engines, but said ULA was moving to accelerate production of its Delta rockets, which do not use the Russian engines.He gave no details on the likely cost of that move.

The new program will allow the Air Force to sharply increase its ability to track ""space junk"" and other smaller objects in space. Currently the Air Force tracks about 23,000 of an estimated 500,000 objects in space, but the new program would allow it to track hundreds of thousands of additional objects. Teague said the new radar system would give the Air Force far greater insight into what is going on in low earth orbit and over the southern hemisphere.

143,"  * Poland brings forward decision on missile system* Lockheed Martin sees more demand in eastern Europe* Western Europe defence budgets unlikely to increaseBy Victoria Bryan and Cyril AltmeyerBERLIN, May 21 The crisis in Ukraine may prompt governments, especially in eastern Europe, to move more quickly on defence procurement decisions - but western Europe is unlikely to loosen its restraint on spending, industry executives said on Wednesday.With eastern European states nervous about Russia after it annexed Ukraine's Crimea region and massed 40,000 troops on Ukraine's borders, Poland already brought forward a planned decision on a new multi-billion-dollar missile defence system.Other countries close to Russia and Ukraine may also start looking to boost defences or order more helicopters, executives at the ILA Airshow in Berlin said.Lockheed Martin, which heads the MEADS consortium bidding for the Polish missile tender, said it was seeing increased interest in the missile system, notably from eastern Europe.""We're seeing greater interest throughout the region and throughout NATO,"" Marty Coyne, business development director for Lockheed's air and missile defence business, said. ""Should Poland make a decision, there's interest in eastern Europe in how they could participate in a component type system. So instead of a 'Polish shield' it would grow to an 'Eastern European' shield,"" he added.Airbus Helicopters said the Ukraine crisis had led to increased enquiries for its products and could lead to new purchase tenders. Military helicopters are of interest because they are used to transport troops quickly from place to place.""Everybody in Europe and outside Europe is evaluating the consequences of this crisis on defence equipment, on military scenarios and I believe this will have an impact on acquisition programmes, both in quantity and in nature,"" Guillaume Faury, CEO of Airbus Helicopters told reporters.""Russia was more and more considered as a non-issue and now it's back,"" he added.Russia said on Wednesday troops were pulling back from the border with Ukraine where eastern regions have fallen largely under the control of pro-Russian rebels. A withdrawal could ease tension before Sunday's presidential election in Ukraine, but the crisis has left its mark on demand.""If you move to the east, it becomes more perceptible, but it has not transformed into anything concrete or tangible,"" Christian Scherer, head of marketing and sales at Airbus Defence & Space, said.ALL QUIET IN THE WEST? While eastern European countries may be reviewing plans and pushing through decisions, it seems unlikely that western governments will be increasing defence spending any time soon. Defence budgets in the five largest Western European markets  - Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Spain - decreased by 1.3 percent in 2013 according to IHS Jane's.In Europe overall, budget defences are expected to fall to $237 billion by 2018, compared with $242.8 billion in 2013, Jane's also said in the report published earlier this year.Glynn Bellamy, UK head of Aerospace and Defence at KPMG, said while he thinks the crisis will accelerate decision making, it won't necessarily lead to an increase in overall spending.""A threat such as that will inevitably cause people to reprioritise,"" he said. ""But countries have realised they have to balance their books. If, for example, they have to increase spending on missile defence, does that mean they will have fewer military personnel?""Germany's new coalition government is carrying out a review of its defence portfolio and the outcome is not expected until the second half of this year, frustrating many at the airshow.Proposals announced on Monday by Airbus, France's Dassault Aviation and Italy's Finmeccanica for the development of a new European drone met with a cool reception from German defence minister Ursula von der Leyen, who said there was no rush to make a decision.Germany did however announce a stopgap measure to provide more Israeli drones while Europe produces its own technology.(Additional reporting by Sabine Siebold and Tim Hepher, editing by Louise Heavens)",2014-05-21,LMT,"Wed May 21, 2014 | 1:36pm EDT","Ukraine crisis may speed defence buys, but budgets stay stuck",http://www.reuters.com//article/ukraine-defence-aerospace-idUSL6N0O53GE20140521?type=companyNews

145,"  (Adds details from Austal)By Andrea ShalalCOLORADO SPRINGS, Colorado May 22 Lockheed Martin Corp and Australia's Austal on Thursday submitted their best ideas for the U.S. Navy's next small warship, as a Navy task force continues to reassess the future of its $34 billion Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) program.The Navy last month asked U.S. and foreign weapons makers to submit cost and technical data on ship designs and weapons to inform the work of the task force that is due to report on various options by July 31. That, in turn, will help the Navy shape its fiscal 2016 budget request.The Navy created the task force after Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel expressed significant concerns about the survivability and firepower of the current LCS ships, and ordered a pause in orders after 32 ships. The Navy has ordered 24 ships of the total 52 planned so far. Lockheed submitted what it called ""a low risk approach with several options"" that would allow the Navy to evolve the current steel monohull design built by Lockheed for the LCS program, said Joe North, vice president of Littoral Ship Systems for Lockheed's Mission Systems & Sensors business.The proposal includes a variety of options for new surface-to-surface missiles, launchers, radar and other equipment - all priced under $700 million - that the Navy can choose to pursue all at once or phase in over the coming years, North said. Lockheed's LCS ships now cost about $460 million each.North said Lockheed also provided details about a higher-end LCS variant it has offered to international buyers that has a bigger hull and includes an Aegis missile defense system. The cost of that option would exceed $700 million, he said. ""We're basically doing a spiral design that offers them different configurations, based on what they may want,"" he said.He said the current design for Lockheed's monohull had 180 metric tons of space set aside for interchangeable equipment packages that could be used for permanent weapons systems. Austal said its response added ""significant offensive and defensive capability"" to its aluminum trimaran design to support higher end missions, including a towed array sonar for anti-submarine warfare, torpedoes, surface-to-surface missiles and equipment to increase the ship's radar detection range.Terry O'Brien, vice president of business development for Austal's U.S. unit, said the process allowed the Navy to work closely with industry and leverage mature designs as it sought to maximize the capabilities of the LCS class of ships.The current class of ships was built to hunt and fight  mines, submarines and surface ships using interchangeable equipment packages, but officials have grown concerned that the ships also need some permanent weapons on board.North said it was ""way too expensive"" to start with a clean sheet design for a new small warship. Such an effort would likely cost around $1 billion, he said, and could result in a new class of warships that cost around $1 billion each.

The Navy has ordered 24 ships of the total 52 planned so far.Lockheed submitted what it called ""a low risk approach with several options"" that would allow the Navy to evolve the current steel monohull design built by Lockheed for the LCS program, said Joe North, vice president of Littoral Ship Systems for Lockheed's Mission Systems & Sensors business.The proposal includes a variety of options for new surface-to-surface missiles, launchers, radar and other equipment - all priced under $700 million - that the Navy can choose to pursue all at once or using a phased-in approach over the coming years, North said. Lockheed's LCS ships now cost about $460 million each. North said Lockheed also provided details about a higher-end LCS variant it has offered to international buyers that has a bigger hull and includes an Aegis missile defense system. The cost of that option would exceed $700 million, he said.""We're basically doing a spiral design that offers them different configurations, based on what they may want,"" he said.He said the current design for Lockheed's monohull had 180 metric tons of space set aside for interchangeable equipment packages that could be used for permanent weapons systems. The current class of ships was built to hunt do battle against mines, submarines and surface ships using interchangeable equipment packages, but officials have grown concerned that the ships also need some permanent weapons on board.North said he was confident the Navy would conclude that it was ""way too expensive"" to start with a clean sheet design for a new small warship, and said such an effort would likely cost around $1 billion, and could result in a new class of warships that cost around $1 billion each. North said Lockheed could start building the new variants as early as 2017, which would allow the Navy to begin modifying the existing LCS ships even before it reached 32 ships.He said additional savings could be achieved, depending on the number of ships the Navy planned to order.Austal, which is building an aluminum trimaran design for the Navy, had no immediate comment on the cost and technical details included in its response to the Navy's request for data.It was not immediately clear which other firms responded to the Navy's request.

148,"   By Andrea Shalal | COLORADO SPRINGS, Colorado  COLORADO SPRINGS, Colorado May 21 A top U.S. Air Force general on Wednesday said she was disappointed about delays on the first Global Positioning System III satellite being built by Lockheed Martin Corp, but believed the company is taking steps to meet its commitments.Lieutenant General Ellen Pawlikowski, commander of the Air Force's Space and Missile Systems Center, said Lockheed was exploring a range of options for the program, including replacing Exelis Inc, the subcontractor that has run into trouble with the satellite's navigation payload.""They know we are not happy, that we are disappointed at the delays we have seen and the technical issues that their subcontractor has had,"" Pawlikowski told reporters at the annual space conference hosted by the Space Foundation.""They are considering whether an alternative source might provide them a better opportunity to meet their contractual commitments to us,"" she said, noting that Lockheed could also opt to replace only certain components, or build them itself. Pawlikowski, who has been nominated to be the Air Force's top military acquisition executive, said she was in close touch with Lockheed about the program, and felt confident that it was ""doing the right things"" to address the delays.Lockheed is under contract to build eight GPS satellites for the Air Force to replace aging GPS satellites in orbit. The new GPS III satellites will provide three times greater accuracy and en eightfold increase in anti-jamming capabilities. Lockheed said Exelis had made good progress on the troubled  navigation payload, and all of the components on the system had passed unit acceptance and environmental tests, except the mission data unit, which was now in thermal vacuum testing.Exelis is now due to deliver the complete navigation payload to Lockheed this autumn, said Lockheed spokesman Matt Kramer. He said each key component and subsystem on the satellite had to pass rigorous testing before it could be integrated on the spacecraft.Kramer said the company issued a request for information to industry in the fourth quarter of 2013 to see what new technologies were available for next-generation payloads.""This is an action we take on many of our programs and the kind of practice a responsible prime contractor undertakes to keep up with the latest technologies and innovations on the market,"" Kramer said. He declined to share details about the responses the company received, calling that data proprietary.A spokesman for Exelis said the company had made ""tremendous"" progress on the navigation payload in recent months, but declined to comment beyond the statement issued by Lockheed.

149,"  (Adds details about shipment to Romania, in paragraph 7)By Andrea ShalalCOLORADO SPRINGS, Colorado May 21 The United States on Wednesday announced the first live-fire test of a Raytheon Co SM-3 missile from the land-based version of Lockheed Martin Corp's Aegis missile defense system, which will be operational in Romania next year.Lockheed said it was the first test of the Aegis system using a land-based missile launcher.The test at the Pacific Missile Range Facility (PMRF) in Hawaii late on Tuesday marks a significant milestone for the Aegis Ashore weapon system, which is designed to protect U.S. and NATO forces in Europe from a ballistic missile attack.The Obama administration's European Phased Adaptive Approach calls for the first Aegis Ashore site to be operational in Romania in 2015, with a second site to follow in Poland in 2018. A Pentagon spokesman, Colonel Steve Warren, said the test ""is important because it's similar to the system that's being shipped to Romania for deployment by the end of next year.""During the test, the Aegis system used on U.S. warships around the world detected, tracked and engaged a simulated ballistic missile target using Raytheon's Standard Missile 3 Block IB, according to the U.S. Missile Defense Agency and the companies. Shipment of components required for the facility that will house the Aegis Ashore weapon in Romania, including the deckhouse, radar and vertical launch system, will begin this summer, said Missile Defense Agency spokesman Rick Lehner. Interceptors would follow when the facility is built, he said.The test of the new system comes amid growing European interest in missile defense as tensions mount between NATO and Russia over its annexation of the Crimea region of Ukraine.Raytheon said an intercept flight test of the system would follow next year. It said the ability to use the SM-3 missile at sea and on land would give military commanders more flexibility. The land-based system uses the same SM-3 missile deployed on Aegis warships, and holds 24 SM-3 missiles at one time. The system can also be expanded to hold more launchers and missiles, Raytheon said.""The SM-3 Block IB deployed for the first time earlier this year at sea, and the success of this Aegis Ashore test keeps us on track to deploy the missile on land in 2015,"" said Mitch Stevison, Raytheon's Standard Missile-3 senior director.Riki Ellison, founder of the non-profit Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance, said the test meant NATO's missile defense shield, developed at a cost of around $800 million, was becoming a reality. He said the Aegis missile defense system had achieved 28 successful test intercepts over the past 11 years.""This system holds great promise for the future,"" Ellison said in a statement, noting that similar systems could be used around the world to deter threats from ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and even unmanned vehicles.

The central question is whether to hold a competitive tender or to buy the F-35 because it is the only plane that can meet the military's needs.Pressed by reporters as to when the government would decide what to do, Finley said Ottawa would first review the report and then see if it had any more questions.""We want to get this done soon,"" she said, declining to be more specific. The F-35 is billed as the only fighter that can avoid radar detection, and advocates say participation in its manufacturing program will allow Canadians to bid on supplying components for the thousands of F-35s to be bought around the world.Opposition parties slammed the decision not to hold a tender to replace the CF-18s, which came into service in the 1980s. The government's spending watchdog said the decision to buy the F-35s had been based on bad data from officials who had downplayed the costs and risks.""We always knew this was going to be a difficult decision.

159,"  (Adds futures prices, company news)     LONDON, May 30 European shares headed for a flat to slightly lower open near multi-year highs on Friday, with investors seen treading cautiously on the last trading day of the month and ahead of next week's crucial European Central Bank policy meeting.     Futures for the Euro STOXX 50, Britain's FTSE 100, Germany's DAX and France's CAC were flat to 0.3 percent lower by 0633 GMT.     ""It's all about the ECB at the moment and this is likely to keep some investors at bay just in case next week's stimulus plan is not as aggressive as the market anticipates,"" IG said in a note.     Reuters reported earlier this month that the ECB is preparing a package of policy options for its June 5 meeting that includes cuts in all its interest rates.      Investors will keep a close eye on banks after the Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the matter, said on Thursday the U.S. Justice Department was pushing BNP Paribas to pay more than $10 billion to resolve a criminal probe into allegations the French bank evaded U.S. sanctions against Iran and other countries for years.      BNP Paribas and the Justice Department declined to comment.     ""Beyond the uncertainty related to the potential financial settlement, the key issues remain of the type of potential charges and impact on BNP Paribas' operational capability,"" Citi said in a note.     Citi removed BNP Paribas from its Focus List Europe citing the uncertainty, but retained a ""buy"" rating on the shares.     Investors' focus will also be on economic data for hints about the market's near-term direction. Figures showed on Friday that German year-on-year retail sales grew at their strongest rate in April since June 2012 as Easter fell later this year than last.      Analysts said that equities had become vulnerable following recent sharp gains to new highs and could slip in the absence of a fresh catalyst.     The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index closed 0.1 percent higher on Thursday at 1,379.05 points, within a whisker of this week's six-year high of 1,380.52 points.     The U.S. S&P 500 index climbed to its third record closing high in four sessions on Thursday as traders shrugged off data showing the economy shrank in the first quarter and bet on improvement in the second quarter.

161,"   By Nadia Damouni | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Some of the largest U.S. companies are looking to hire cybersecurity experts in newly elevated positions and bring technologists on to their boards, a sign that corporate America is increasingly worried about hacking threats.JPMorgan Chase & Co, PepsiCo Inc, Cardinal Health Inc, Deere & Co and The United Services Automobile Association (USAA) are among the Fortune 500 companies seeking chief information security officers (CISOs) and other security personnel to shore up their cyber defenses, according to people with knowledge of the matter.While a CISO typically reports to a company's chief information officer (CIO), some of the hiring discussions now involve giving them a direct line to the chief executive and the board, consultants and executives said. After high-profile data breaches such as last year's attack on U.S. retailer Target Corp, there is now an expectation that CISOs understand not just technology but also a company's business and risk management.    ""The trend that we are seeing is that organizations are elevating the position of the CISO to be a peer of the CIO and having equal voice associated with resource priorities and risk decisions,"" said Barry Hensley, executive director at Dell SecureWorks' Counter Threat Unit.    With many companies looking for security executives with military or defense backgrounds, people with the right expertise can command increasingly higher salaries.Large corporations have recently hired CISOs for between $500,000 and $700,000 a year, according to Matt Comyns, global co-head of the cybersecurity practice at search firm Russell Reynolds Associates. Compensation for CISOs at some technology companies with generous equity grants have reached as high as $2 million, he said.In comparison, CISOs who have been with a company for five or more years are on $200,000 to $300,000 per year, Comyns said.NEW URGENCY  Security experts have often criticized corporate America for being too complacent about cyber risks and for not doing enough to protect their computer networks from hackers.A recent PwC survey found the vast majority of cybersecurity programs fell far short of guidelines drafted by the Commerce Department's National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Only 28 percent of more than 500 executives surveyed said their company had a CISO or Chief Security Officer.But high-profile data breaches, such as the one at Target, have injected a new sense of urgency, executives said. Target ousted its CEO, Gregg Steinhafel, earlier this month, and its chief information officer, Beth Jacobs, resigned in February. The retailer is now searching for a CISO, a newly created role.    ""This is ringing bells at the C-suite,"" Charlie Croom, vice president of cybersecurity solutions at U.S. defense contractor Lockheed Martin Corp told the Reuters Cybersecurity Summit. Recruiters and executives said companies are increasing both the size and budget of their security teams. By the end of 2014, JPMorgan's annual cybersecurity budget will rise to $250 million from $200 million in 2012, CEO Jamie Dimon said in April. And the largest U.S. bank will have about 1,000 people focused on cybersecurity, compared with 600 people two years ago, he said.  A JPMorgan spokesman said the bank will continue to invest and expand its security team, but declined to confirm if the firm was looking for a CISO.Cardinal Health CIO Patty Morrison said the healthcare services company was looking to hire a vice president of security to bring in ""new talent and new ideas."" USAA Chief Security Officer Gary McAlum confirmed the diversified financial services group was looking for a CISO.Deere representatives were not available for comment, while a spokesman for PepsiCo declined to comment. The soft drink and snack maker lost its CISO, Zulfi Ahmed, to MetLife Inc earlier this year. CHANGING FACE OF BOARDS  As companies look for CISOs, many boards are seeking directors with technology know-how so that they can better understand cyber risks. Matt Aiello, co-head of the cyber practice at Heidrick & Struggles, said he is seeing ""unprecedented"" demand for CIOs to serve on boards.""Boards don't feel they have the right expertise to draw upon. It is not that they don't understand it is a risk; they don't want to blunder uninformed into it,"" said David DiBari, managing partner at the law firm Clifford Chance in Washington.  Retired Accenture CIO Frank Modruson, former Department of Defense CIO Teresa Takai, Dell SecureWorks chief Mike Cote and AT&T Inc CISO Ed Amoroso have all been approached to serve as potential directors, according to people with knowledge of the situation. Takai said she is ""looking at a couple of things,"" including with a security technology company. Cote, through a Dell spokeswoman, confirmed he has been approached by several companies about serving on their boards. An AT&T spokesman declined to comment on behalf of Amoroso. Modruson was not available for comment.Pamela Craig, who serves on the boards of Akamai Technologies Inc, Wal-Mart Stores Inc and software maker VMWare Inc, expects demand for CIOs to serve on public boards to increase. ""You need people who have direct first-hand experience in the boardroom,"" she said.      Some boards are also considering moving responsibility for network security to risk committees from audit committees, as cybersecurity is increasingly viewed as a business risk more than a compliance issue, according to Mary Galligan, director of Cyber Risk Services at Deloitte & Touche LLP.RSA Security Senior Vice President Amit Yoran said boards are looking for experts who can help them build security into products in development, rather than bolting it on at the last minute.""CISOs are being brought to the business table more often,"" Yoran said. ""This is a realization that in many cases a business's survival relies on the security of the technology.""

162,"  (Adds official announcement by Pentagon, reaction from Raytheon)WASHINGTON, June 2 The Pentagon's No. 1 supplier, Lockheed Martin Corp, has won a $915 million contract to develop a ground-based radar for tracking objects in space for the U.S. Air Force, beating out a bid from Raytheon Co .The fixed-price contract, which includes an incentive fee, was announced late on Monday by the Pentagon in its daily digest of major contract awards. U.S. military officials have underscored the importance of the Air Force's Space Fence program, given the growing number of countries operating satellites in space, China's work on anti-satellite weapons, and the huge amount of debris in orbit. The new program will allow the Air Force to increase sharply its ability to track ""space junk"" and other smaller objects in space. Currently the Air Force tracks about 23,000 of an estimated 500,000 objects in space, but the new program would allow it to track hundreds of thousands of additional objects. Plans call for the new system to be based on Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands, about 2,100 miles southwest of Honolulu, Hawaii, and to start operating in September 2018.Raytheon said it had been notified about the Air Force's decision, but said it would be inappropriate to comment further until after it receives a post-decision debrief from Air Force officials.

166,"  (Adds Lockheed comment, byline)By Andrea ShalalWASHINGTON, June 2 Lockheed Martin Corp  on Monday beat out Raytheon Co to win a $915 million contract from the U.S. Air Force for a ground-based radar that will track about 200,000 pieces of old satellites and other objects in space.The Pentagon announced the fixed-price contract for the new ""Space Fence,"" which includes an incentive fee, late on Monday in its daily digest of major contract awards.The deal covers development and construction of the new radar on Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands, about 2,100 miles (3,400 km) southwest of Honolulu, with initial operations to start in late 2018.The deal also includes an option for a second site in western Australia, said Steve Bruce, vice president for advanced systems at Lockheed's Mission Systems and Training Business. Bruce, speaking with reporters, declined to estimate the total value of the contract, including that option and others, but analysts said it would be worth just under $2 billion.U.S. officials have underscored the importance of the Space Fence program given the growing number of countries operating satellites in space, China's work on anti-satellite weapons, and the huge amount of debris in orbit around the earth.The program will increase the U.S. government's ability to track spent rocket boosters, dead satellites and other ""space junk"" that could damage satellites or the International Space Station, Bruce said. The Air Force now tracks about 23,000 of an estimated 500,000 objects orbiting the earth, but the new radar will increase that number tenfold.Brian Weeden, a former Air Force analyst who now works with the Secure World Foundation, said the new system still faced challenges, including the need for new computers to process the larger amount of data that will be collected. ""There's a lot that can still go wrong,"" he said. Raytheon said it had been notified about the Air Force's decision, but that it would be inappropriate to comment further until after it receives a post-decision debrief from Air Force officials. A company spokesman declined comment on whether it would protest the decision.Doug Loverro, deputy assistant secretary of defense for space policy, told Reuters last month that the Air Force cut the projected cost of the new radar system by two-thirds by mandating prototypes and manufacturing demonstrations.Bruce said the Air Force scaled back its requirements as a result of studies conducted by Lockheed and other companies in the early stages of the procurement process, ultimately deciding to use space-based assets to track debris in higher orbits.""The Air Force did a terrific job of looking at these requirements and coming up with something that's affordable,"" he said.Bruce declined to provide Lockheed's expected profit on the deal, or other details of the contract terms, but said the fixed-price deal was unusual for a development project.

167,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Canada is poised to buy 65 Lockheed Martin Corp F-35 Joint Strike Fighter jets, sources familiar with the process told Reuters, marking a major renewal of Canada's fighter fleet and helping contain costs of the expensive defense program.An 18-month review of Canada's fighter jet needs has concluded that the government should skip a new competition and proceed with the C$9 billion ($8.22 billion) purchase, three sources said.The decision must still be finalized by Prime Minister Stephen Harper's cabinet. The government is likely to face fierce criticism from opposition politicians concerned that the contract is being awarded without an open competition. Similar concerns over sole-sourcing and costs derailed the purchase two years ago.A spokesman for Harper's office said there was nothing to announce yet.However, the sources said the recommendation was expected to lead to formal approval of the F-35 purchase. They said Harper and key cabinet members supported the decision.Canada's planned purchase is the 6th-largest by a country and would further safeguard the $399 billion program.

Senior Lockheed officials told Reuters in November they expected news about the program in the next several months..Those hopes dimmed in recent months after a series of leadership changes in Saudi Arabia, which required a fresh series of briefings, said the source, who was not authorized to speak publicly. Saudi Arabia has been considering plans to modernize its eastern naval fleet for years, a project valued by analysts at around $20 billion. The U.S. proposals include possible purchases of up to 12 of Lockheed's steel monohull Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) or the larger DDG-51 destroyer built by General Dynamics Corp.Dale Bennett, the executive vice president who heads the Lockheed mission systems and support division that builds the LCS ships, said the company remained convinced its ship offered the right capability for Saudi Arabia's need. ""We're hopeful that something will move forward and we're supporting both (the U.S. and Saudi Arabian) navies in any way we can, but it's not clear to me that anything's moving soon,"" Bennett told Reuters.Lockheed's initial proposal included a modified version of Lockheed's Aegis combat system, an MH-60R helicopter it builds with Sikorsky Aircraft, a unit of United Technologies Corp , a fast missile craft it designed with VT Halter Marine, a unit of ST Engineering.U.S. Navy officials had no immediate comment on the Saudi naval modernization program.

178,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON, June 9  WASHINGTON, June 9 Lockheed Martin Corp  on Monday said it was banking on international and non-defense orders to offset a drop in U.S. military spending, with Pentagon orders accounting for a low 61 percent of overall sales in 2013 and trending lower.Lockheed Chief Financial Officer Bruce Tanner said U.S. defense orders would likely dip further as a percentage of overall revenues in 2014 and 2015, and orders could drop as low as 50 percent, depending on what happened in other business areas.""It's not in our long-term vision to get to 50-50 ... but it's not out of the possibility that it could drop there,"" Tanner told Reuters at the company's annual media conference.He said Lockheed's revenues would remain ""fairly flat"" in 2014 and 2015, but could start to edge higher in 2016 or 2017, based on current Pentagon budget projections. Lockheed Chief Executive Officer Marillyn Hewson told reporters the company was focused on delivering next-generation weapons like the F-35 fighter jet, expanding its international footprint, and developing new technologies to address the need of a growing world population for clean water and affordable energy.She said Lockheed expected to reach its target of generating 20 percent of revenues overseas in the ""next year or so,"" up from around 17 percent now, with further growth seen in coming years. The remaining 21 percent of Lockheed's revenues come from civilian U.S. agencies, and 1 percent from commercial orders. Hewson cited strong foreign demand for the F-35 fighter jet, which will comprise about 25 percent of Lockheed's total revenues when the jet reached full production later this decade, missile defense, space programs, and the C-130J cargo plane.Despite flat to declining U.S. military sales, Lockheed is continuing to invest in new technologies, Hewson said, citing promising work in several areas such as generating energy from the world's oceans, and new nanocarbon fibers. She said the company raised internal spending on research and development (R&D) projects by 13 percent in 2013 to around $700 million, and expected another 5 percent increase this year.Tanner said the company was investing more of its own funding in research now so it was positioned for new programs when Pentagon spending began to edge higher again in 2017, once the brunt of mandatory congressional spending cuts were over.""I'm not a big race car driver, but I've always heard that races are won in the corners,"" he said. ""Downturns are sort of the analogous 'corners' in this industry. That's when you do make some differentiation that hopefully sets you up for the straightaways.""Lockheed executives are watching for several big potential foreign orders, including a missile defense competition in Poland; Canada's decision on whether to buy 65 F-35 fighter jets; and negotiations with Saudi Arabia over a large number of PAC-3 missile orders.

Kendall, Bogdan and other U.S. officials spoke with reporters after a two-day meeting of top officials with the key companies and countries involved in the $398.6 billion program, the Pentagon's costliest weapons program.Kendall said the Pentagon was also starting to look at a possible multi-year procurement agreement, given the large numbers of jets to be bought by the U.S. military and other countries, which could help further lower the acquisition cost.Lockheed is developing three models of the F-35 for the U.S. military and eight countries that helped fund its development: Britain, Australia, Canada, Turkey, the Netherlands, Italy, Norway and Denmark. Israel, Japan and South Korea have also announced plans to buy the new warplane. Kendall said the Marine Corps, Air Force and Navy were still on track to meet the target dates they have set in 2015 through 2018 for being able to use the jets in combat.But he said the Block 3F software needed for the Navy's F-35 C-model, which will operate from an aircraft carrier, was about six months behind schedule due to the challenges involved in integrating data from a wide range of sources, including other airplanes, and being able to test the software. Bogdan said the program office was working as hard as it could to avert or shorten any delay in the 3F software, but said  a delay in the software would not necessarily force the Navy to postpone its plan to start using the jets in combat from 2018.The Navy is slated to start testing its C-model jets on an aircraft carrier this fall for the first time.The officials said the government was working with Lockheed and engine maker Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp, to identify tens of millions of dollars in investments in process improvements, design changes and other measure to lower the cost of building and operating the jets.Kendall said the investments would be carefully reviewed to ensure companies were able to recover their investments and that the measures would truly lower costs. He said Lockheed and Pratt also needed to work more closely with suppliers to cost cuts.

184,"  * Top weapons buyer says ""No silver bullet""* U.S. Navy names General Dynamics, Lockheed units ""superior suppliers""* Shipbuilder Huntington Ingalls fails to make U.S. Navy listBy Andrea ShalalWASHINGTON, June 13 The U.S. Navy on Friday named units of top arms makers General Dynamics, Lockheed Martin Corp and Raytheon Co as part of its list of the top-performing nine suppliers for 2014 based on their performance over the last three years.The Pentagon said on Friday it would use such public recognition of ""superior suppliers,"" incentives and competition as key tools in its ongoing drive to end years of cost overruns and schedule delays on key weapons programs. Top U.S. arms buyer Frank Kendall said the Navy developed the list as a pilot project this year, but he had asked the Air Force and Army to compile their own lists this year as part of the continuing effort to improve defense acquisition.""We want to recognize their performance, but we also want to motivate our performers who are not on that list to do better,"" Kendall told reporters as he released a second annual report on the Pentagon's procurement, development and operating budgets, which totalled over $350 billion in fiscal 2015 budget request.The nine companies also included units of General Electric , Northrop Grumman Corp, a venture of Lockheed and Sikorsky Aircraft, a unit of United Technologies Corp, and Britain's Rolls Royce Holdings Plc. One notable exception was Huntington Ingalls Industries , one of the Navy's largest suppliers, and builder of aircraft carriers, submarines and other warships.Navy acquisition chief Sean Stackley said the suppliers that did make the list would be offered the chance to reduce certain contract requirements, including removal of some procedures, inspections or requirements, which could lead to cost savings.Kendall said the Pentagon had imposed affordability targets on 30 of its biggest programs and all but two or three were within those caps. But he said uncertainty about future budget levels continued to hamper more efficient investment decisions. He said the Pentagon remained focused on improving the way it buys hundreds of billions of dollars of weapons and services each year, but there was no single ""silver bullet"" to do that.Instead, he said the department needed to work on multiple fronts, including efforts to simplify the overlapping laws that govern defense acquisitions, better training for federal workers that administer contracts, and deeper analysis of past programs.""Defense acquisition is complicated and varying,"" he wrote in the 116-page report. ""We must empower, encourage and train our workforce to think - not dictate a cookbook that workforce members blindly follow.""The report cited good results from contracts with incentive fees, but said incentives were sometimes counterproductive and the Pentagon did not always use such measures as well as it could.Kendall also highlighted the importance of competition, but  said the department needed to get more creative about injecting competition into the process given declining defense budgets and growing consolidation in the industry.

The actions are aimed at helping Iraq counter militants of the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, or ISIL, a group Obama described as ""vicious"" and a ""terrorist organization"" that could eventually pose a threat to Americans.Obama said Iraqi leaders needed to set aside sectarian differences to deal with the threat, and said the United States would engage in ""intensive diplomacy"" in the region to try to prevent the situation from worsening.""The United States is not simply going to involve itself in a military action in the absence of a political plan by the Iraqis that gives us some assurance that they are prepared to work together,"" Obama told reporters at the White House.Obama said he would consult with the U.S. Congress in coming days.

Some surveillance drones have been collecting data on rebel movements.A spokesman for Lockheed Martin, which makes Hellfire missiles being sold to Iraq, said it would work with the U.S. government to accelerate those deliveries, if asked. Kirby declined to explicitly say whether the Pentagon was confident the Iraqi security forces could hold Baghdad.""We were surprised and disappointed by the poor performance of some Iraqi security force units (that are) up in the north. I'd be less than honest if I said that that performance instilled a lot of confidence.

Obama said he was concerned that ISIL could try to overrun Shi'ite sacred sites, creating sectarian conflicts ""that could be very hard to stamp out."" The rebels are Sunni Muslims and the Baghdad government of Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki is dominated by Shi'ites.""This is a regional problem, and it is going to be a long-term problem. And what we're going to have to do is combine selective actions by our military to make sure that we're going after terrorists who could harm our personnel overseas or eventually hit the homeland,"" Obama said.Obama said he wanted to review intelligence on the situation in Iraq so that any U.S. actions are ""targeted, they are precise, and they are going to have an effect.""He noted that the U.S. has already ""poured a lot of money into these Iraqi security forces.""Obama spoke with Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper about the crisis on Friday and was expected to talk to other foreign leaders about the situation over the weekend, White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters traveling with Obama on Air Force One on a previously scheduled trip to North Dakota. Obama was scheduled to spend the weekend in California.Earnest said the Obama administration had not at this stage discussed potential interventions with Iran, Iraq's neighbor to the east and a backer of Maliki.The United States and Iran, which have feuded since the 1979 Islamic revolution, would appear to have a joint interest in defeating the Sunni Muslim insurgents who have seized large swaths of northwestern Iraq. A senior Iranian official told Reuters that Iran might be willing to cooperate with Washington.Obama said the insurgency so far had not caused major disruptions to oil supplies from Iraq, but that if insurgents took control of refineries, other oil producers in the Middle East would need to help ""pick up the slack.""""That will be part of the consultations that will be taking place during the course of this week,"" Obama said.

187,"  (Adds number of planes affected, details on engine)By Andrea ShalalWASHINGTON, June 15 The U.S. military has ordered mandatory inspections of all Lockheed Martin Corp  F-35 fighter jets before further flights after a Marine Corps F-35B model suffered an in-flight emergency last week, a Pentagon spokesman said on Sunday.Joe DellaVedova, spokesman for the F-35 program office, said the inspections were ordered late on Friday but that a majorityof the 97 F-35s in the fleet - 69 operational jets used for training and 28 test aircraft - had already been inspected and cleared to resume flights on Monday.He said the inspections, first reported by the Wall Street Journal, were focused on the oil flow management valve fitting on all F135 engines, which are built by Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp. The valve provides oil flow to the engine bearing compartments. News of the engine issue came just days after Frank Kendall, the Pentagon's chief arms buyer, said the F-35 program was making progress but more work was needed on developing the jet's software and improving its reliability.The inspections were ordered after an F-35B model suffered an in-flight emergency on June 10 caused by oil loss in the jet's engine at a Marine Corps base in Yuma, Arizona, where issues have now been found with a total of three valves, DellaVedova said. He said the pilot returned to base safely and there were no injuries.No issues have been discovered at the other bases where F-35s are flown in California, Florida, Arizona and Maryland, he said.Pratt & Whitney spokesman Matthew Bates said the company was working closely with the Pentagon's F-35 program office to determine the cause of the issue. He said it took about 90 minutes to inspect each aircraft, and nearly all planes had been inspected and cleared for further flights. Bates said the F135 engine had completed nearly 32,000 hours of combined ground and flight testing, with more than 16,000 logged in operational flights. Engine availability had remained steady at or above 98 percent, he said.Bates also said the engine was designed to survive significant damage from foreign objects as well as oil deprivation, and the control system for the engine included redundant mechanical and electronic parts.DellaVedova said the source of that F135 engine oil leak appeared to be a supply line to engine bearings and a fitting that separated from the body of the valve in question.It was not clear if the issue was maintenance-related.

211,"  (Adds interview with Sikorsky executive)By Andrea ShalalWASHINGTON, June 26 Sikorsky Aircraft, a unit of United Technologies Corp, won a $1.28 billion contract on Thursday to develop a new combat rescue helicopter for the U.S. Air Force, a deal that could eventually be worth up to $7.9 billion.The initial contract covers development and delivery of four new Combat Rescue Helicopters (CRH) based on the company's workhorse UH-60 Black Hawk, and caps nearly 15 years of repeated unsuccessful efforts by the Air Force to replace its aging fleet of HH-60G Pave Hawk rescue helicopters.The Air Force said Sikorsky beat its affordability target by about $700 million.Sikorsky welcomed the deal, noting that it has built combat search and rescue helicopters for the U.S. military since 1943. Sikorsky President Mick Maurer said the helicopters allowed the Air Force to ""perform one of its most important and sacred missions - bringing our downed service members home safely."" Air Force Secretary Deborah James said the Air Force was the key service responsible for global personnel recovery, and remained committed to a mission she described as ""part of the military ethos.""More than 12,200 U.S., allied and other forces have been saved in rescue missions around the world, the Air Force said.Thursday's contract with Sikorsky comes after one of the longest-running and controversial acquisition programs the service has attempted in recent decades. ""It has been a very, very long road,"" Sam Mehta, president of Sikorsky Military Systems, told Reuters in an interview.He said Sikorsky bid aggressively to win the contract, aware of the budget pressures facing the Pentagon and expecting tough competition from other companies. He said work on Black Hawk variants for the Army and Navy would allow Sikorsky to leverage economies of scale in the supply chain and lower costs. The new contract - and a separate one for a new presidential helicopter - will bolster Sikorsky production from 2019 on, but the company still faces challenges in the near-term because of declining U.S. military spending, Mehta added.He said the company was heartened by news on June 24 that the Pentagon had approved the sale of Black Hawk helicopters to Mexico, a deal worth $225 million, and was chasing other orders.The Air Force awarded Boeing Co a contract to build 141 rescue helicopters based on its twin-rotor CH-47 ""Chinook"" design in 2006, but the deal was protested immediately by the losing bidders - Sikorsky and Lockheed Martin Corp - and later canceller by then-Defense Secretary Robert Gates.The Air Force restarted the program in 2012, but Boeing, Northrop Grumman Corp and Europe's Airbus later dropped out of the competition, arguing that the Air Force had skewed the requirements to favor Sikorsky's helicopter.In March, the Air Force's 2015 budget request to Congress omitted funding for the program, but officials added the program back in the same day under pressure from senior U.S. lawmakers.

He said the Marine Corps resumed F-35B flights on Friday.Four F-35B jets arrived early evening on Friday at an air base in southern Maryland, where they will be readied for their first trans-Atlantic flights, according to sources familiar with the program. The jets came from a Marine Corps base in Yuma, Arizona.The deployment of the jets to Britain had been called into question after a fire broke out in the rear of an Air Force A-model F-35 on Monday as the pilot was preparing to take off for a training flight. The  Air Force on Thursday suspended flights of all F-35 A-model jets while it investigates the fire. Flights of some Navy jets were also suspended, but others continued to fly, according to Navy officials.Sources familiar with the situation said engine pieces and fragments were found on the runway at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida after the fire, the first confirmation that the fire involved the plane's engine, which was built by Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp.The Air Force has not released any details about its investigation and a spokeswoman had no immediate comment on the report that engine components were found. Pratt builds the engines for all three models of the F-35: the Air Force's conventional takeoff A-model, the Marine Corps' B-model, which can land vertically, and the Navy's C-model, which is for use on aircraft carriers.The sources, who were not authorized to speak publicly, said the discovery of the engine parts did not point to a specific cause of the fire and said the investigation was continuing. But they said it cleared the way for the Marine Corps and Navy to resume flights since their B- and C-model jets have a different engine.Pratt & Whitney spokesman Matthew Bates said his company was ready to assist in the Air Force investigation, and referred all further questions to the Air Force.Lockheed also said it was ready to assist with the investigation, but declined to comment on the latest news.One of the sources said discovery of engine fragments on the runway after the fire could point to several different possible causes, including a manufacturing quality issue affecting just the engine in question, which had flown for about 150 hours.Engine damage could also stem from debris in the engine, or a maintenance problem, the sources said.

218,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Sikorsky Aircraft, a unit of United Technologies Corp (UTX.N), won a $1.28 billion contract on Thursday to develop a new combat rescue helicopter for the U.S. Air Force, a deal that could eventually be worth up to $7.9 billion.The initial contract covers development and delivery of four Combat Rescue Helicopters (CRH) based on the company's workhorse UH-60 Black Hawk, and caps nearly 15 years of repeated unsuccessful efforts by the Air Force to replace its aging fleet of HH-60G Pave Hawk rescue helicopters.The Air Force said Sikorsky and its key supplier, Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N), beat the service's affordability target by about $700 million.Sikorsky welcomed the deal, noting that it has built combat search and rescue helicopters for the U.S. military since 1943. Sikorsky President Mick Maurer said the helicopters allowed the Air Force to ""perform one of its most important and sacred missions – bringing our downed service members home safely.""Air Force Secretary Deborah James said the Air Force was the key service for global personnel recovery, and remained committed to a mission she called ""part of the military ethos.""

He said work on Black Hawk variants for the Army and Navy would allow Sikorsky to leverage economies of scale in the supply chain and lower costs.Lockheed said it would supply the mission systems and special equipment for the new helicopters, including adverse weather sensors, defensive systems and mission computers.The new contract - and a separate one for a new presidential helicopter - will bolster Sikorsky production from 2019 on, but the company still faces challenges in the near-term because of declining U.S. military spending, Mehta added. He said the company was heartened by news on Tuesday that the Pentagon had approved the sale of Black Hawk helicopters to Mexico, a deal worth $225 million, and was chasing other orders.The Air Force had awarded Boeing Co (BA.N) a contract to build 141 rescue helicopters based on its twin-rotor CH-47 ""Chinook"" design in 2006, but the deal was protested immediately by the losing bidders - Sikorsky and Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) - and later canceled by then-Defense Secretary Robert Gates.The Air Force restarted the program in 2012, but Boeing, Northrop Grumman Corp (NOC.N) and Europe's Airbus (AIR.PA) later dropped out of the competition, arguing that the Air Force had skewed the requirements to favor Sikorsky's helicopter.

220,"  * Bids from Lockheed Martin and Israel are dropped* Tender was revised after Russia intervened in Ukraine* Poland choosing operational systems over advanced technology   (Recasts, updates with statement from losing consortium)By Marcin GoettigWARSAW, June 30 Poland has short-listed a consortium of France's Thales and European group MBDA, as well as U.S. firm Raytheon, in its tender for a mid-range missile defence system, the defence ministry said on Monday.The bids that lost out on the tender, which is estimated to be worth about $5 billion, were from the Israeli government and the MEADS consortium led by Lockheed Martin.Poland, a NATO member since 1999, had accelerated the process to select a supplier for the missile system after Russia's intervention in Ukraine prompted fears among NATO members in eastern Europe they could be next in line. The Polish defence ministry also changed the criteria for the system, saying it should be already operational and in use by a NATO member state's armed forces.That ruled out the Lockheed Martin-led bid, which involved technology still in development, and the Israeli bid, called David's Sling, which is also not yet in operation.The ministry said terms of the tender will ensure the participation of Poland's domestic defence industry in the construction of the missile defence, with the state defence holding Polska Grupa Zbrojeniowa playing a key role. Raytheon welcomed the announcement.""We are moving ahead to provide Poland with the most advanced air and missile defense system in use today by 12 countries around the world,"" said Dan Crowley, President, Raytheon Integrated Defense Systems.""And (we) look forward to partnering with the Polish industry to build the next generation Patriot system."" The first phase of the Polish system, know in Poland as Wisla, is for eight sets of mid-range interceptor rockets, which may later be supplemented by short-range ones.Poland has already passed legislation to secure funding for the system, the ministry said earlier this year.MEADS International issued a statement saying it was disappointed with Poland's announcement, but that it would keep working with existing national partners Germany and Italy to finish development of the system.""Today's announcement reflects new criteria for the Wisla selection, and should they change again, we stand ready with the most advanced air and missile defence system available today.""The planned system is separate from elements of a U.S. missile shield to be deployed in Poland by 2018, as confirmed by U.S. Vice President Joe Biden on a visit to Warsaw this week.($1 = 3.0482 Polish Zlotys)    (Additional reporting by Andrea Shalal-Esa in Washington; Editing by David Evans)",2014-06-30,LMT,"Mon Jun 30, 2014 | 2:39pm EDT","UPDATE 2-Poland short-lists Raytheon, Thales in missile system tender",http://www.reuters.com//article/poland-defence-idUSL6N0PB4WM20140630?type=companyNews

224,"  (Repeats item first issued on Thursday with no changes to text)By Tim Kelly and Nobuhiro KuboTOKYO, July 3 Japan's Mitsubishi Electric  has agreed to take the first step towards a partnership with European missile maker MBDA to develop a medium-range air-to-air missile for the F-35 stealth fighter, two people with knowledge of the matter said.The preliminary deal marks an extension of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's bid to launch Japan's military suppliers into the global arms market through international tie-ups, and thereby bring down costs for Japan's defence procurement.If successful, it would represent the first time Japanese-built components had been used on a missile sold overseas, one of a string of potential international arms deals to emerge since Abe's government moved in April to end a more than four decade-old ban on military exports.The value of the missile-development deal remains unclear. Mitsubishi Electric has agreed to start a feasibility study, one of the people said.Mitsubishi Electric, better known for making refrigerators and vacuum cleaners, is the prime supplier of air-to-air missiles to Japan's Self Defence Forces, including a medium-range model, the AAM-4, used on its F-15 fighters and locally designed F-2 jets. It is also a leading supplier of satellites to the Japanese government.MBDA is a pan-European company formed more than a decade ago from the missile units of BAE Systems, Airbus  and Finmeccanica.A spokeswoman for Mitsubishi Electric declined to comment. MBDA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.JOINT RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT  MBDA's armoury includes the Meteor air-to-air missiles for the Eurofighter. Britain has considered a modified version of that missile as a candidate for the F-35s the Royal Air Force and Royal Navy plan to buy form Lockheed Martin Corp.Japan has so far ordered 42 F-35 fighters, which it plans to deploy in 2017. Global orders for the F-35 are expected to exceed 3,000, with Italy, Turkey, Canada and Australia among the U.S. allies planning to purchase the plane.The proposed missile deal would be the first major project resulting from a pact signed by Japan and Britain in July last year that created a legal framework for the two countries to do joint research and development on defence equipment. A second agreement committed the countries to guard classified information exchanged in that work.To manage cooperation between Mitsubishi Electric and MBDA, and guide future projects, a steering committee of Japanese and British officials will meet for the first time during the week-long Farnborough Air Show, which begins on July 14, according to the sources.Japan is also discussing a similar co-development accord with France and has committed to concluding an agreement with Australia. OVERSEAS PUSH The rush into international partnerships has become a plank of Abe's military industrial policy.Including Mitsubishi Electric's partnership with MBDA, Japan is involved in, or considering, five projects with other nations to design weapons systems that could be used both in Japan and abroad.At the centre of those projects is Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI), which built the World War Two-era Zero fighter plane. It is co-developing a missile with Raytheon  designed to shoot down ballistic missiles in space. Mitsubishi Heavy and Mitsubishi Electric are separate companies, but share a common origin as part of an industrial conglomerate broken up by the United States after Japan's defeat in 1945.In January, sources told Reuters that Mitsubishi Heavy was in talks to supply rear fuselage parts for the F-35 to Britain's BAE Systems.More recently, Japan has moved to accelerate talks with Australia that could lead to a deal to supply it with a multi-billion dollar fleet of stealth submarines. Mitsubishi Heavy and Kawasaki Heavy Industries build subs for Japan's navy.Japan's military is also seeking bids from local and foreign firms for a new transport helicopter that could be exported overseas in a test case of how it will use sales of equipment abroad to bring down procurement costs at home.Bidders for that project include Kawasaki Heavy partnered with Airbus's helicopter unit, Fuji Heavy Industries, the maker of Subaru cars with Bell Helicopter, a unit of industrial conglomerate Textron, and Japanese trading company Mitsui & Co joined with AgustaWestland, a subsidiary of Italy's Finmeccanica.Abe's government is looking to lower procurement costs for Japan's military, in part by giving arms suppliers the ability to sell equipment overseas. Because of the limits imposed by its build-at-home for use-at-home military sourcing, Japan has paid two or three times more than other governments for similar military equipment, analysts have said.Exports would enable Japanese arms makers to spread their costs over a bigger production base, making them more cost efficient.At the same time, Abe moved this week to end a ban that has kept Japan's military from fighting abroad since 1945.The change, the most dramatic policy shift since Japan set up its post-war armed forces 60 years ago, will widen Japan's military options by ending the ban on exercising ""collective self-defence"", or aiding a friendly country under attack.

226,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The U.S. military said it had grounded the entire fleet of 97 Lockheed Martin Corp F-35 fighter jets until completion of additional inspections of the warplane's single engine built by Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp.The Pentagon's F-35 program office, Air Force and Navy issued directives on Thursday ordering the suspension of all F-35 flights after a June 23 fire on an Air Force F-35A jet at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida.The Pentagon said U.S. and industry officials had not pinpointed the cause of the fire, which occurred as a pilot was preparing for takeoff. The pilot was not injured.The incident is the latest to hit the Pentagon's costliest weapons program, the $398.6 billion F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. It followed an in-flight oil leak that triggered mandatory fleetwide inspections of the jets last month.""Additional inspections of F-35 engines have been ordered, and return to flight will be determined based on inspection results and analysis of engineering data,"" the Defense Department said in a brief statement issued late on Thursday.Pratt & Whitney said it was working closely with Air Force officials who are investigating the fire and are inspecting all engines in the fleet. Spokesman Jay DeFrank said it would be inappropriate to comment further since the incident was the subject of an investigation.The Pentagon's F-35 program office has made determining the cause of the fire its highest priority and it is assessing the impact on flight tests, training and operations of the radar-evading warplane. A person familiar with the situation said it was premature to rule in or out any quality problem or manufacturing defect.Japanese Defense Minister Itsunori Onodera he wanted to discuss the F-35 problem when he visits the United States next week to tour U.S. bases and meet with Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel.""On my coming trip to the U.S. I plan to be reviewing troops and will have a chance to discuss the F-35 development on the ground,"" Onodera told a regular news conference. ""I’d like to confirm the details of this accident."" Japan has ordered 42 of the single-engine stealth jets that will be assembled locally by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, maker of the World War II-era Zero fighter. Tokyo may order more F-35s when it decides the future of 100 of its older F-15s.Australia and South Korea said there had been no change to their plans to buy the fighter jets. Australia plans to buy 58 of the fighters and South Korea intends to buy 40. ""To date the JSF aircraft has accrued 15,000 flight hours While the F135 engine has successfully completed nearly 32,000 hours of testing,"" a spokesman for Australia's Defense Minister David Johnston said.""Single engine fighters are operated by many air forces and Defense remains confident the F-35 JSF will be reliable and safe."" Reuters reported on Wednesday that U.S. and British authorities were preparing directives ordering a mandatory engine inspection estimated to take about 90 minutes.British officials remained part of the discussions with U.S. officials and concurred with the U.S. recommendation to ground the jets, pending further inspection results, the F-35 program office said.The Pentagon said preparations were continuing for F-35 jets to participate in two UK air shows later this month, but a final decision would be made early next week. The fire has already derailed plans for an F-35 jet to fly by a naming ceremony for Britain's new aircraft carrier on Friday.The Royal International Air Tattoo (RITA) kicks off July 11 followed by the Farnborough International Air Show starting on July 14.

Korea, Australia say no change in plans to buy F-35s   (Adds Japan comment in paragraphs 10-12)By Andrea ShalalWASHINGTON, July 3 The U.S. military said it had grounded the entire fleet of 97 Lockheed Martin Corp  F-35 fighter jets until completion of additional inspections of the warplane's single engine built by Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp.The Pentagon's F-35 program office, Air Force and Navy issued directives on Thursday ordering the suspension of all F-35 flights after a June 23 fire on an Air Force F-35A jet at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida.The Pentagon said U.S. and industry officials had not pinpointed the cause of the fire, which occurred as a pilot was preparing for takeoff. The pilot was not injured.The incident is the latest to hit the Pentagon's costliest weapons program, the $398.6 billion F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. It followed an in-flight oil leak that triggered mandatory fleetwide inspections of the jets last month. ""Additional inspections of F-35 engines have been ordered, and return to flight will be determined based on inspection results and analysis of engineering data,"" the Defense Department said in a brief statement issued late on Thursday.Pratt & Whitney said it was working closely with Air Force officials who are investigating the fire and are inspecting all engines in the fleet. Spokesman Jay DeFrank said it would be inappropriate to comment further since the incident was the subject of an investigation.The Pentagon's F-35 program office has made determining the cause of the fire its highest priority and it is assessing the impact on flight tests, training and operations of the radar-evading warplane.A person familiar with the situation said it was premature to rule in or out any quality problem or manufacturing defect. Japanese Defense Minister Itsunori Onodera he wanted to discuss the F-35 problem when he visits the United States next week to tour U.S. bases and meet with Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel.""On my coming trip to the U.S. I plan to be reviewing troops and will have a chance to discuss the F-35 development on the ground,"" Onodera told a regular news conference. ""I'd like to confirm the details of this accident.""Japan has ordered 42 of the single-engine stealth jets that will be assembled locally by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, maker of the World War II-era Zero fighter. Tokyo may order more F-35s when it decides the future of 100 of its older F-15s. Australia and South Korea said there had been no change to their plans to buy the fighter jets. Australia plans to buy 58 of the fighters and South Korea intends to buy 40.""To date the JSF aircraft has accrued 15,000 flight hours While the F135 engine has successfully completed nearly 32,000 hours of testing,"" a spokesman for Australia's Defence Minister David Johnston said.""Single engine fighters are operated by many air forces and Defence remains confident the F-35 JSF will be reliable and safe.""Reuters reported on Wednesday that U.S. and British authorities were preparing directives ordering a mandatory engine inspection estimated to take about 90 minutes.British officials remained part of the discussions with U.S. officials and concurred with the U.S. recommendation to ground the jets, pending further inspection results, the F-35 program office said.The Pentagon said preparations were continuing for F-35 jets to participate in two UK air shows later this month, but a final decision would be made early next week. The fire has already derailed plans for an F-35 jet to fly by a naming ceremony for Britain's new aircraft carrier on Friday.The Royal International Air Tattoo (RIAT) kicks off July 11 followed by the Farnborough International Air Show starting on July 14.

229,"  (Adds US Marine Corps statement)By Andrea ShalalLONDON, July 9 British Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said Lockheed Martin Corp's F-35 fighter jet may miss the Royal International Air Tattoo air show this week given a fleet-wide grounding ordered after an engine failure last month.But Hammond told a conference in London on Wednesday that he was ""still optimistic"" that the new warplane would be cleared to fly in time to make a delayed international debut at the world's biggest air show in Farnborough, outside London, next week.Military and industry officials are pressing hard to ensure that the jets are able to make their international debut at the Farnborough show. Missing both shows would be a huge embarrassment and could undermine U.S. efforts to drum up additional sales of the new fighter.U.S. Air Force and Pentagon officials at the conference had no immediate update on the safety investigation into the engine failure that occurred on June 23 as a pilot was preparing to take off from Eglin Air Force Base in Florida.The U.S. Marine Corps still plans to send some of its F-35B jets - which can take off from shorter runways and land vertically - to Britain this month, spokesman Captain Richard Ulsh said. Engine maker Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp, is examining the engine at its West Palm Beach facility in Florida, but has not released any details about the likely cause of the engine failure.The engine incident has already forced the F-35 to skip a planned ""fly by"" at the naming ceremony for Britain's new aircraft carrier last week, and U.S. industry and military officials are not certain whether the grounding will be lifted in time for the planes to travel to the British air shows.Hammond said Britain, which helped fund development of the new warplane, had a ""huge commitment"" to the F-35 program. He noted that the plane was still in the developmental stage, when technical issues are meant to be worked out. The program has completed about 60 percent of developmental testing, according to the Pentagon's F-35 program office.Hammond said U.S. officials made the ""right decision"" when they suspended all F-35 flights while authorities investigated an engine failure and fire that occurred on June 23 when an F-35A was preparing to take off from a Florida air base.""At this stage of the program we can afford to take a cautious approach,"" he told a conference hosted by the Royal United Services Institute for Defence and Security Studies. ""I don't have concerns about the overall program,"" he said.He said the program was ""close to running out of time"" to fly F-35 jets to Britain in time for the RIAT air show that starts in Fairford later this week, but he remained upbeat about the jets appearing at the Farnborough air show next week.Hammond said the UK defence budget agreed for the rest of the parliament was tight but was manageable. Efficiency savings could still be made but further cuts would be damaging, he said.Britain has cut defence spending by around 8 percent over the last four years as part of a government plan to reduce a record budget deficit, leaving it with an army which by 2020 will be the smallest it has been since the Napoleonic Wars of the early nineteenth century.""It is clear to me that we couldn't take further significant reductions in the defence budget without it having some very meaningful consequences,"" he said.

Now it is in place to be implemented,"" Martin said.Air Force Lieutenant General Christopher Bogdan, the Pentagon's F-35 program chief, said the agreement would allow the companies to recoup their investment and a small profit, but only after the plane's cost came down.He said the U.S. government could invest additional money from 2016 to 2018 if the initial cost reductions proved to be successful. Martin said the savings would cut the cost of each F-35 fighter jet by about $10 million to under $80 million, including an engine, by 2019.That is down from the $98 million cost of an Air Force F-35 A-model jet, without an engine, that was included in Lockheed's contract to build a seventh batch of jets for the U.S. military.Bogdan said the agreement meant the Pentagon and other countries would soon be able to buy a ""fifth generation"" fighter  with its unprecedented capability for a price that would nearly equal any ""fourth generation"" fighters on the market, but with far more advanced capability. He said the Pentagon was continuing to negotiate contracts with Lockheed and engine maker Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp, despite an engine fire last month that triggered a fleetwide grounding of the F-35.He said the department was ""in the end game"" on both contracts, but still had some additional work to do.Lockheed and Pratt executives said they expected to finalize the separate agreements soon. Pratt & Whitney had already invested $65 million to lower the cost of the F135 engine it builds for the plane under its ""war on cost"" since 2009, and planned further investments of $15 million over the next three years, said spokesman Matthew Bates.Bogdan said the Pentagon and the companies that build the jet were also looking at possible block buys of F-35s grouping U.S. and foreign orders, to achieve greater economies of scale and further lower the cost.Efforts were also underway to lower the operating and maintenance costs of the jets by 30 percent, Bogdan said.Martin said the engine failure was unfortunate but Lockheed and the other contractors would do whatever was needed to correct the issue and get back on schedule with the program.

235,"   By Andrea Shalal | RAF FAIRFORD England  RAF FAIRFORD England Borne of the last downturn in U.S. military spending in the 1990s, Lockheed Martin Corp's F-35 Joint Strike Fighter was intended as a quick and affordable way for the United States and its allies to replace thousands of aging F-16s and other warplanes while avoiding the pitfalls of earlier programs.Nearly two decades and a $166 billion jump in projected costs later, the world's largest arms program was poised for a high-profile international debut at two British air shows when the Pratt & Whitney engine on one of the jets broke apart and caught fire during a takeoff from a Florida air base. The incident has grounded the existing fleet of 97 F-35 jets and triggered a fresh wave of criticism about the costly new warplane, although U.S. and British officials are underscoring their continued commitment to the program, which now has a revised price tag of $398.6 billion.The latest engine issue came weeks after an in-flight oil leak that sparked a brief grounding in June, but U.S. officials remain hopeful the jet will at least fly at the bigger of the two UK events - the Farnborough Airshow that starts on July 14.Lockheed‘s F-35 program manager Lorraine Martin told reporters that the planes would miss the first day of the Royal International Air Tattoo air show, but could still arrive in time to fly at the event, which continues through July 12. She said Lockheed had spare parts on hand at the air field in case they were needed.British Defense Secretary Philip Hammond on Wednesday said the F-35 may miss the Air Tattoo given the grounding order, but said he was optimistic that the plane would fly at Farnborough.It would be a huge embarrassment if it misses that show too, and could undermine export interest in the jet just as several countries including Canada and Denmark, both of which helped fund development of the jet, are weighing F-35 orders.DEVELOPMENTAL TESTING With three different models, supersonic speed and cutting-edge electronics, the F-35 was designed as a multi-service, multi-national program to lower development and production costs. Yet early technical challenges drove the cost of the program nearly 70 percent over initial estimates. Pentagon officials say the F-35 is finally making progress after several major restructurings and years of delays, but also say the jet still has 40 percent of developmental testing to go.The sheer complexity and scale of the program, which involves three U.S. military services and 9 other countries that have placed firm orders, also mean that grounding and technical issues have a far wider impact than on a single-service weapon.Lockheed is developing and building three models of the F-35 for the U.S. Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps, and a growing number of countries. Analysts say the latest technical issue underscores the danger of starting production of a new weapons system before all testing is finished, a practice known as ""concurrency"".Frank Kendall, the Pentagon's chief arms buyer, has called that approach ""acquisition malpractice"", and is putting in place reforms to avoid similar problems on other weapons programs. The Pentagon recently lowered its estimate for the cost of concurrency - or retrofitting existing F-35 jets to correct design problems - but officials warn that new issues can always crop up, such as the June 23 incident in Florida.""Engineering discoveries are a normal part of this and every other aircraft development program. Some of them are relatively insignificant, and others more concerning, but with each test event and every training mission we are learning and constantly improving,"" said U.S. Air Force Lieutenant General Christopher Bogdan, who runs the Pentagon's F-35 Joint Program Office.The F-35 program is still in development, but the airplanes are already being used for training and some operations, and the Marine Corps plans to start using them in combat from July 2015.Marine Lieutenant General Jon Davis, deputy commandant for aviation, reiterated those plans in a statement to Reuters, noting that the jet's capabilities would ""revolutionize the way the Marine Corps projects power from the sea and the shore"".But he said the Marine Corps would not declare an ""initial operating capability"", or IOC, next year if any capability defined in its requirements was not delivered. Bogdan provided no details on the investigation into the engine incident, but said he was confident in the plane's design and operation given its ""increased maturity and stability"".He said everyone involved in the F-35 program was working ""day and night"" to try to understand the cause of the engine failure, and safety remained the program's top priority.A strictly controlled U.S. Air Force investigation into the engine failure continues, which means U.S. government and industry officials are more tight-lipped than ever.But questions are emerging about quality control issues at Pratt, which faced problems with fuel lines last year.""This could have serious consequences for Pratt unless they can say without a doubt why this part failed, and can convince the Joint Program Office that this was a one-off thing,"" said one defense official who was not authorized to speak publicly.The program's complex structure - with jets already owned by three different military services and two foreign countries - has also revealed the need to better coordinate any moves by ""airworthiness"" authorities to suspend flights.In this case, the Air Force launched its standard safety investigation procedures after the engine incident, quarantining the jet and locking out the other services, as per its protocols. But that left many questions unanswered for the other military services and global partners on the program.The Pentagon is expected to revamp the process to ensure better coordination in the future, said multiple sources familiar with the program.

More than 100 pilots have been qualified to fly the jet.The Air Force is also flying jets at bases in Nevada and Arizona.U.S. NAVY Current plans call for the U.S. Navy to buy 260 C-model F-35s, which have longer wings and a special tailhook that allows them to land on aircraft carriers. Lockheed and the F-35 program are testing a redesigned tailhook, with at-sea testing due to take place in the fall of 2014.U.S. MARINE CORPS The Marine Corps, the smallest of the U.S. military branches, plans to buy 340 F-35 B-models, which can take off from shorter runways and land vertically, and 80 F-35 C-models to replace its current fleet of F/A-18 Hornets, EA-6B Prowlers, and AV-8B Harrier ""jump jets.""The Marines have been flying jets at an air base in Arizona, and have said they were on track to start using the F-35Bs by mid-2015.BRITAIN  The Royal Air Force and Royal Navy, which have invested $2 billion to help develop the new warplane, plan to buy a total of 138 F-35 B-models.Britain has so far committed to buying 48 of the new planes, and is expected to announce plans for the next 14 jets this year. It has already received three jets.ITALY Italy initially planned to buy 131 F-35 fighters, but curtailed its order to 90 jets in 2012. It is slated to buy 60 F-35A models and 30 F-35Bs.Italy's state-owned defense company Finmeccanica is one of the subcontractors on the project and its Alenia unit will assemble the planes purchased by Italy, the Netherlands and Norway at a large facility in northern Italy.THE NETHERLANDS The Dutch military initially planned to buy 85 F-35As in coming years but announced in September that it would buy just 37 jets for now, and could order more later. It has already received two jets that will be used for training.  TURKEY Turkey is slated to buy 100 F-35As and has placed a firm order for the first two jets.AUSTRALIA Australia is slated to buy 100 F-35As, with the first jet to be delivered later this year. In April, Australia announced plans to buy 58 jets in addition to the 14 already ordered.NORWAY Norway plans to buy 52 F-35A fighter jets and has authorized the purchase of 16 jets.  DENMARK Denmark was slated to buy 30 F-35As, but it has launched a fresh competition that will not be decided until the end of June 2015.CANADA Canada was poised to buy 65 F-35As for C$9 billion but announced in December 2012 that it would evaluate all available options for new fighters. This followed an outcry over the government's decision to buy the F-35 without an open competition.ISRAEL Israel has ordered 19 F-35 jets and plans to order up to 75 jets in coming years. A second order could come later this year.JAPAN  Japan announced in December 2011 that it was ordering 42 F-35 A-model jets and may order more in coming years. Japan is also building a final assembly and checkout plant for the jets.SOUTH KOREA South Korea has confirmed its plans to buy 40 F-35A jets to replacing its aging F-4 jets. OTHER COUNTRIES Singapore and Belgium are among other countries that have expressed interest in the Lockheed fighter jet.

241,"   By David Alexander | EGLIN AIR FORCE BASE, Fla., July 10  EGLIN AIR FORCE BASE, Fla., July 10 U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel told military fliers on Thursday the stealthy F-35 attack plane had ""issues"" but was still ""the future for our fighter aircraft"" despite a fire that grounded the fleet and jeopardized its international debut in Britain.In a visit to the Florida base where the blaze occurred in late June, Hagel spoke with F-35 pilots and maintenance workers about the Lockheed Martin aircraft but was not able to say whether the planes would be cleared to resume flight in time to participate in air shows in Britain.Key F-35 contractors are Lockheed Martin Corp, Northrop Grumman Corp and BAE Systems Plc.Hagel, speaking in front of a pair of the F-35s, said the pilots and maintainers voiced ""tremendous confidence"" in the so-called fifth-generation aircraft, which has stealthy radar-evading technology and a suite of integrated sensors that digest and feed information to the pilot through a special helmet. ""Some of the pilots told me it was the best aircraft that they had ever flown and some said it was the easiest and simplest aircraft they'd ever flown,"" Hagel said.""I was particularly happy to hear that because I believe this aircraft is the future for our fighter aircraft for our services,"" he said. ""This is as big a project, the F-35, as we have at the Department of Defense and we've got a lot riding on this aircraft."" Hagel said he knew ""there are issues"" with the plane but he had ""strong, strong confidence in the people who make this aircraft fly (and) maintain it.""The F-35 is the world's largest arms program and is currently projected to cost about $398.6 billion. The plane, which will ultimately replace most of the U.S. military's fighters, has been sharply criticized over its huge cost growth. The plane had been scheduled to make its international debut at two air shows in Britain beginning this week - the Royal International Air Tattoo and Farnborough International Airshow.But the military last week grounded the entire fleet of 97 aircraft in the aftermath of a fire at Eglin in late June in which a Pratt & Whitney engine on an Air Force variant of the plane broke apart and caught fire during takeoff. Pratt & Whitney is a unit of United Technologies Corp.Eglin is one of the main bases where F-35 pilots and maintainers are being trained. Officials said there were 49 F-35s at the base, including all three variants of the plane.Lockheed Martin Corp, Northrop Grumman and BAE on Thursday said they would invest up to $170 million over the next two years to cut the cost of each of the new warplanes to under $80  million each by 2019.

242,"  (Adds comment from Marine Corps general)By Andrea ShalalRAF FAIRFORD, England, July 12 The U.S. Navy maintained a grounding order for F-35 B-model and C-model fighter jets built by Lockheed Martin Corp, saying it was still not clear what caused a massive engine failure on an Air Force F-35 jet last month.The fleetwide grounding order kept three Marine Corps F-35 B-model jets and one British F-35B from traveling to Britain for widely publicized appearances at two air shows.""At this time, I do not have sufficient information to return the F-35B and F-35C fleet to flight,"" Vice Admiral David Dunaway, who heads the Navy's Air Systems Command, said in an update to a grounding order issued by U.S. officials on July 3. A copy of the document was obtained by Reuters.In the document, Dunaway said he was committed to returning the F-35 fleet to flight as soon as possible, but there was still ""no discernible event that represents a root cause.""The memo emerged after a lengthy meeting on Friday of the officials responsible for determining the ""airworthiness"" of the F-35, according to sources familiar with the matter.In the incident on June 23 at a Florida air base, the Pratt & Whitney engine on an Air Force F-35 A-model jet broke apart, pushing through the top of the airplane and catching fire while a pilot was preparing to take off.Marine Lieutenant General Jon Davis, deputy commandant for aviation, told Reuters late on Friday that the jets might not appear at the Farnborough air show, which begins next week. But he did not see the engine issue as a long-term setback. ""I think we're being very, very conservative in our approach to this, which is the right thing to do,"" he said. ""This is a fantastic program and we don't want to do anything to screw it up ... No one wants to do anything that isn't prudent.""Until the grounding is lifted, the U.S. Marine Corps and Britain will not be able to ferry the F-35B aircraft to Britain for the jet's planned international debut at two air shows there this month - the Royal International Air Tattoo, the world's largest military air show that began on Friday, and the Farnborough air show, which starts on Monday and runs until July 20.It would be a embarrassment to the United States if the jets miss both shows and could weaken the plane's export prospects just as two initial partners in the program - Canada and Denmark - are weighing fresh orders.The engine issue also prevented the F-35 from appearing at the July 4 naming of Britain's new aircraft carrier. Dunaway said the Navy and other services are continuing to investigate the incident, and planned to update the flight directive no later than July 16 - two days after the start of the Farnborough air show outside London.Lockheed spokesman Michael Rein said the company still hoped the jets could be cleared to fly in time to make the show.RISKS  Dunaway's memorandum did not rule out the possibility that the most advanced U.S. fighter jet could still appear toward the  end of the Farnborough air show, but the prospects of that occurring appeared to be dimming fast.""There are specific additional evaluation conditions required to support the Farnborough air show in the UK, including the ferry flight across the Atlantic and performance in the air show itself. Additional work is required in order to understand and mitigate air show unique risks,"" it said.The three Marine Corps F-35B jets are waiting at a Maryland air base to fly across the Atlantic, and the UK jet that had been due to join them remains at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida. A fourth Marine Corps jet is also waiting at the Maryland base in case the British jet cannot make the trip.The U.S. jets were ready to fly as soon as the grounding order was lifted, said one person familiar with the situation.Dunaway said the current analysis would have to be refocused to allow the F-35's participation in the Farnborough air show. The jets need a full day in Britain to allow for any maintenance or repairs before they participate in flying demonstrations.Dunaway said officials were looking at possible operational restrictions for the jets while the issue was being investigated, and would also likely implement repeated engine inspections to monitor for any indication of a future problem. But those measures would take several more days to complete.It remains unclear what caused the third stage of the Pratt engine to break apart. The incident severed a fuel line, which then caused a fire.Frank Kendall, the Pentagon's chief weapons buyer, told U.S. lawmakers on Thursday there was ""growing evidence"" that the incident was an individual event and had not been caused by a systemic issue. He said all existing engines had been inspected and that no similar issues had been found, but he said safety was the Defense Department's top priority.

246,"  * No F-35 on day one of Farnborough air show, maybe later* Engine fan blade broke off* Issue not seen as ""fundamental design flaw""   (Recasts with information about cause of failure)By Andrea ShalalLONDON, July 13 The engine failure that has grounded the entire fleet of Lockheed Martin Corp F-35 fighter jets was caused by ""excessive"" rubbing of fan blades in the plane's Pratt & Whitney engine, but does not appear to be a fundamental design flaw, the Pentagon's chief weapons buyer said on Sunday.Defense Undersecretary Frank Kendall told reporters on Sunday there was still a chance that the grounding order could be lifted in time for the F-35 to make its international debut at the Farnborough air show.Organisers of the show confirmed that the F-35 would not appear on Monday, but said it could still arrive and fly later in the week. The United States' newest combat jet had already been pulled out of a British military show last week, after the entire fleet was grounded following a massive engine failure on a U.S. Air Force F-35 at a Florida air force base on June 23.Kendall said the grounding had halted testing but he did not view the incident as a ""fundamental setback"" for the $400 billion program, the Pentagon's biggest, which still has about 40 percent of developmental testing to complete.He said the engine had suffered two issues involving fan blades in the past few years, but they appeared unrelated and not systemic to the airplane. ""None of those things that have happened, including this recent one as far as I know, suggests that we have a fundamentally flawed design,"" Kendall said.He said detailed inspections of engines on the fleet of 97 F-35s already built had not shown signs of the kind of excessive rubbing founded on the engine that broke apart, although there were signs of milder rubbing in several other engines.Kendall said the evidence being compiled did not point to a systemic issue, but the analysis was still going on. In this case, engineers found evidence of significant rubbing by the fan blades against a cowl. ""We're not noticing it throughout the fleet,"" he said. ""The design allows for a limited degree of rubbing, but it was enough in this case to cause a structural reaction that ultimately led to failure.""Bennett Croswell, president of Pratt & Whitney's military engine business, declined comment on any details about the engine failure and what caused it.Marillyn Hewson, chief executive of Lockheed Martin, said it was disappointing that the jet had not flown in Britain thus far, but the company stood ready to support the jet if flights were allowed to resume.She said military officials from other countries were supportive of the process now under way.""People who understand the nature of development take this in stride as normal discoveries in development,"" Hewson said.

Tighter military budgets in the United States and Europe have resulted in a dearth of orders for new jets, forcing weapon makers like BAE and Lockheed to battle it out for upgrade work. The global market for similar upgrades on F-16 jets is estimated at about $10 billion over the next ten years, according to BAE System's vice president for global fighter programs John Bean. Bean was optimistic that BAE's ""cost effective"" proposition would help it win a large share of that market. ""A majority of it is our expectation,"" Bean said, when asked how much of the total F-16 upgrade work BAE thought it could win.BAE's strategy of operating without the need for the large, expensive infrastructure of the equipment maker itself, would help it win business, he explained.  ""It's the way we structure the business that allows us to be more cost effective,"" he said. SINGAPORE, GREECE   Singapore and Greece are amongst the future F-16 modernization opportunities for both companies, while BAE said it had also received interest from Turkey and Chile, plus three to four other countries which Bean said had not gone public.Bill McHenry, head of business development for Lockheed’s F-16 program, said his company was standing ready to support Singapore's upgrade plans, but could not say when a possible order could be finalised.McHenry also said that with economic conditions improving in Greece, that country, with a long-standing interest in a revamp, was once again in talks with possible providers. Greece could firm up its plans in the next six months to a year, he said.Lockheed suffered a blow this year when the U.S. Air Force canceled planned upgrades for a number of F-16s due to budget constraints, but McHenry said the Air Force was now pursuing more modest and limited upgrades to its F-16s that would include a mission computer upgrade and new cockpit avionics. Lockheed remained on track to complete similar work for Taiwan, McHenry said. ""That program is on schedule,"" he told Reuters in an interview at the Royal International Air Tattoo last week.BAE's Bean said South Korea's F-16s would be fitted with new weapons systems, e-scan radar and new mission avionics, adding that BAE's improvement capability offered higher resolution screens and higher speed technologies compared with its rivals.Up to 3,000 F-16s could eventually need upgrades, Bean said, with interest from countries including Egypt and Morocco a future possibility. BAE has established a team of 165 in Fort Worth, Texas, to do the work and plans to add another 150 engineers to the team.

Matthew Bates, spokesman for Pratt & Whitney, said the company had great confidence in the F135 engine it builds for the new fighter jet and had worked closely with the military to return the jet to flying status.""It would be great for the jets to come to the Farnborough Air Show so the audience here can see the capabilities the F-35 brings to the U.S. and our partners,"" Bates said.SAFETY IS PRIORITY  Top executives from the biggest contractors involved in the F-35 program have traveled to Britain for the plane's foreign debut, which had appeared in doubt until Tuesday's news.Four U.S. Marine Corps jets are waiting to take off for Britain from a Maryland air base as soon as they are cleared to do so. Officials are studying the flight restrictions to determine if the jets could fly to Britain.The planes were slated to follow a route relatively close to the U.S. and Canadian coast, up past Greenland before heading to Europe, rather than a direct flight across the Atlantic Ocean, according to sources familiar with the plans.Kirby gave no details about the restrictions and engine inspections, but said they would remain in effect until the root cause of the June 23 engine failure was identified and corrected. ""Safety remains the overriding priority,"" he said. Air Force Lieutenant General Chris Bogdan had told reporters on Monday that U.S. officials were ""not giving up"" on trying to bring the F-35 to Britain.     Sources familiar with the matter said the decision to lift the grounding order was made at a high-level meeting on Monday, and reflected growing evidence the engine failure was a one-off event and not due to a systemic or fundamental design flaw.Pentagon acquisition chief Frank Kendall told reporters on Monday that no similar problems had been found on any of the other 98 engines in service, and underscored that the program was still in the development stage when technical problems are meant to be found and fixed.Pratt President Paul Adams told Reuters in an interview at the air show that the F135 engine failure, and a separate incident in May involving its CSeries commercial engine, were unrelated and did not point to a larger problem at the company.Adams, who took over as president in January, said it had been a ""challenging few weeks,"" but said both engines were still going through the developmental stage that is aimed at flushing out problems and resolving them.

Currently, all of the military’s key spacecraft are launched on United Launch Alliance Atlas 5 and Delta 4 boosters.Privately owned Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX, filed a lawsuit in April in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims to protest the Air Force’s latest sole-source launch contract, an $11 billion award for 36 booster rockets from United Launch Alliance.The Air Force and United Launch Alliance have asked the court to dismiss the suit, claiming SpaceX missed its window of opportunity to contest the arrangement, which was first announced in 2012.While SpaceX and the Air Force wrangle in court, they also are closely cooperating to get SpaceX certified to compete for future U.S. military launch contracts.“If everything goes extremely well ... by December of this year we’ll have them certified,” General William Shelton, head of Air Force Space Command, said at a joint hearing of the Senate Armed Services and Commerce committees on Wednesday.“The only (launch services) provider that’s really in a serious certification process is SpaceX,” Shelton added. On Tuesday, the Air Force said SpaceX had completed three successful, consecutive launches of its upgraded Falcon 9 rocket. A bevy of engineering reviews, manufacturing assessments and other analysis is pending.Shelton said the Air Force has 136 people assigned to the SpaceX certification process, and expects to spend about $100 million on the effort.Certifying SpaceX to fly U.S. military payloads also could alleviate concerns about Russia banning exports of its RD-180 rocket engines, which are used to power the Atlas 5.Congress is considering bills that include between $25 million and $250 million to assess options and begin work on a new rocket engine. The Obama administration, which opposes the proposal, estimates the engine would cost $4.5 billion. “Throwing money at a problem where we don’t know where we’re going is not a good idea at this point,” Alan Estevez, who oversees Department of Defense acquisitions, told legislators during Wednesday’s hearing, which was webcast.Optimistically, it would take eight years to get a new engine developed, tested and certified, Estevez added. By that time, the issue could be moot.The Air Force intends to end its sole-source relationship with United Launch Alliance by Oct. 1, 2017, the start of the 2018 fiscal year, Shelton said.SpaceX also plans to debut a heavy-lift Falcon rocket next year. If successful, the company, owned and run by technology entrepreneur Elon Musk, would have rockets technically capable of meeting most if not all of the military’s launch requirements. Currently, the Delta 4 and some configurations of Atlas 5 are beyond the Falcon 9’s capabilities, Shelton said.Pressed by U.S. Senator Bill Nelson, a Florida Democrat who chairs the science and space subcommittee, Estevez conceded that it would be substantially cheaper to certify a new launch provider than pay for designing, building and testing a new rocket engine for the Atlas 5.“Development of new engine and integration costs are obviously much more expensive than the cost to us to certify a new entrant,” Estevez said.SpaceX declined to say whether it intended to bid for the National Reconnaissance Office satellite launch.“Opening up more National Security Space missions to competition is a step in the right direction and SpaceX welcomes this news,” company spokesman John Taylor said in an email.Proposals are due Aug. 14.

271,"  (Adds comment from Norwegian official)By Andrea ShalalFARNBOROUGH, England, July 16 The engine failure that grounded Lockheed Martin's F-35 fighter jets and the warplane's now-cancelled appearance at two UK air shows provided key ""lessons learned"" for the companies that build the jets, and the military forces that use them.While the outcome was disappointing for air show visitors and many people involved in the F-35 program, U.S. military and industry officials said both the engine incident and air show planning allowed them to learn a lot about handling future problems and taking the jets overseas.The $400 billion weapons program is the world's largest single arms project and encompasses three different U.S. military services, eight countries that helped fund the plane's development, two other foreign militaries, and a separate Pentagon office, as well as three separate aircraft models.U.S. military officials on Tuesday announced that they had approved limited flights of the F-35 jets but imposed mandatory engine inspections and various flight restrictions, and banned the planned flights to Farnborough air show.The latest grounding - the program's 12th to date - was not the longest, but it was complicated by the fact that U.S. and British jets were due to leave for Britain just days after the Pratt & Whitney F135 engine on an Air Force jet broke apart and caught fire at a Florida Air Force base on June 23.Strict Air Force protocols for safety investigations - which include quarantining the affected jet - also meant that engineers from the Pentagon and engine maker Pratt did not have access to the affected jets for days, which slowed efforts to get the jets flying again.Orlando Carvalho, executive vice president of Lockheed's aeronautics division, told Reuters on Wednesday that Lockheed and its key suppliers learned a great deal while preparing for what would have been the F-35's first foreign deployment, building on the planes' first deployments to the USS Wasp for testing in 2011 and 2013. He said Lockheed developed detailed plans for transporting and storing spare parts, provided maintenance support and tested  international use of the computerized logistics system called ALIS that stores mission plans and maintenance data - and all those systems worked well.Carvalho said he was less concerned about hashing over what happened in this incident than ensuring improved procedures to deal with any future mishaps. Any changes to procedures would be led by the government in consultation with industry, he said.""The fundamental question coming out of the last three weeks is, okay, if this were to occur again, how do we do this better?"" he told Reuters at the Farnborough air show that was supposed to celebrate the new jet's international debut.He said differentiated plans were needed to deal with incidents that affected each separate model, as well as those that were common to all three. Air Force Lieutenant General Christopher Bogdan, the Pentagon's F-35 program chief, told reporters earlier this week the program would review and revamp current communications procedures about accidents and other safety concerns.Marine Lieutenant General Jon Davis, who took over as deputy commandant for aviation on July 1, said the military was used to doing ""after action reports"" about what went right and wrong on any military operation.""We are going to get smart about how we do things as a joint program. That will probably be the number one thing that comes out of this,"" Davis said. ""I can guarantee that we'll come up with a little bit different construct for the next time around.""Davis said the services' needed to retain the responsibility for investigating accidents and mishaps, but it was critical to do that in a way that allowed sharing of information, at an appropriate level, with affected other operators.

272,"   By Andrea Shalal | FARNBOROUGH, England, July 16  FARNBOROUGH, England, July 16 The engine failure that grounded Lockheed Martin's F-35 fighter jets and the warplane's now-cancelled appearance at two UK air shows provided key ""lessons learned"" for the companies that build the jets, and the military forces that use them.While the outcome was disappointing for air show visitors and many people involved in the F-35 program, U.S. military and industry officials said both the engine incident and air show planning allowed them to learn a lot about handing future problems and taking the jets overseas.The $400 billion weapons program is the world's largest single arms project and encompasses three different U.S. military services, eight countries that helped fund the plane's development, two other foreign militaries, and a separate Pentagon office, as well as three separate aircraft models.U.S. military officials on Tuesday announced that they had approved limited flights of the F-35 jets but imposed mandatory engine inspections and various flight restrictions, and banned the planned flights to Farnborough air show.The latest grounding - the program's 12th to date - was not the longest, but it was complicated by the fact that U.S. and British jets were due to leave for Britain just days after the Pratt & Whitney F135 engine on an Air Force jet broke apart and caught fire at a Florida Air Force base on June 23.Strict Air Force protocols for safety investigations - which include quarantining the affected jet - also meant that engineers from the Pentagon and engine maker Pratt did not have access to the affected jets for days, which slowed efforts to get the jets flying again.Orlando Carvalho, executive vice president of Lockheed's aeronautics division, told Reuters on Wednesday that Lockheed and its key suppliers learned a great deal while preparing for what would have been the F-35's first foreign deployment, building on the planes' first deployments to the USS Wasp for testing in 2011 and 2013. He said Lockheed developed detailed plans for transporting and storing spare parts, provided maintenance support and tested  international use of the computerized logistics system called ALIS that stores mission plans and maintenance data - and all those systems worked well.Carvalho said he was less concerned about hashing over what happened in this incident than ensuring improved procedures to deal with any future mishaps. Any changes to procedures would be led by the government in consultation with industry, he said.""The fundamental question coming out of the last three weeks is, okay, if this were to occur again, how do we do this better?"" he told Reuters at the Farnborough air show that was supposed to celebrate the new jet's international debut. He said differentiated plans were needed to deal with incidents that affected each separate model, as well as those that were common to all three.But Air Force Lieutenant General Christopher Bogdan, the Pentagon's F-35 program chief, told reporters earlier this week the program would review and revamp current communications procedures about accidents and other safety concerns.Marine Lieutenant General Jon Davis, who took over as deputy commandant for aviation on July 1, said the military was used to doing ""after action reports"" about what went right and wrong on any military operation.""We are going to get smart about how we do things as a joint program. That will probably be the number one thing that comes out of this,"" Davis said. ""I can guarantee that we'll come up with a little bit different construct for the next time around."" Davis said the services' needed to retain the responsibility for investigating accidents and mishaps, but it was critical to do that in a way that allowed sharing of information, at an appropriate level, with affected other operators.He said the services should also look at ways to ensure quick sharing of data about pilot training and procedures, as well as emergency response procedures, as more and more jets are fielded in a growing number of countries in coming years.Paul Adams, president of Pratt & Whitney, said the fact that the program was still doing developmental testing while already producing larger numbers of jets - a practice called concurrency - had actually helped officials get more insight earlier in the performance of the engines and other components.Far more F-35 jets were in use now for testing and training than is typical at this stage in a normal development program because of concurrency, he said.Marine Corps Captain Richard Ulsh said cancellation of the F-35's appearance at the air was unfortunate for show planners and visitors, but provided valuable training for the Marines.""We learned how to logistically support the F-35 on a different continent and most importantly we safely returned the aircraft to flight in a relatively short amount of time to continue training pilots,"" he said.

286,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON, July 29  WASHINGTON, July 29 U.S. authorities have loosened some flight restrictions on  Lockheed Martin Corp's  F-35 fighter jets, allowing pilots to fly faster and take tighter curves, as military officials investigate a massive engine failure that grounded the entire fleet of warplanes for over three weeks.Pilots can now fly at speeds of up to 1.6 Mach, up from 0.9 Mach, and carry out turns with a gravitational load of 3.2 Gs, up from 3 Gs, a U.S. defense official and other sources familiar with the program told Reuters on Tuesday.The changes will allow F-35 test pilots and trainers to carry out additional maneuvers and flight tests, but it remains unclear how much of an impact the grounding and restrictions will have on the program's flight test schedule for the year.U.S. airworthiness officials are still requiring inspections of the Pratt & Whitney engines that power the jet every three hours, but that requirement and other restrictions may be revised as the investigation winds down, the official said.The F-35, the world's most expensive weapons project with a price tag of about $400 billion, was grounded for weeks after an engine failure and fire that damaged a U.S. Air Force F-35 plane as it prepared to take off from a Florida air base on June 23. The incident prevented the jets from making their international debut at two British air shows this month, and could compound software development challenges detailed in a report prepared before the grounding by the Pentagon's chief arms buyer. A summary of the report was obtained by Reuters.The report criticized a March 2014 master schedule developed by Lockheed and forecast delays of up to 14 months in delivery of certain software still under development, but said it did not expect those delays to affect the schedule for the Marine Corps and other services to start using the jets in combat.The Pentagon's F-35 Joint Program Office (JPO) said it agreed with eight recommendations made by the Pentagon report to improve software development, and was implementing the changes. Joe DellaVedova, F-35 program spokesman, said the program had delivered 7.4 million lines of software code so far. The overall program will include 8 million lines of code for the aircraft, and 15.9 million lines for ground systems such a computer-based logistics system, he said.Lockheed spokeswoman Laura Siebert said the company was working with the Pentagon to assess the impact of the grounding and flight limitations on the F-35 flight test program.

A second defense official said other jets in the F-35 fleet that carried out the same maneuver did not exhibit signs of the ""excessive rubbing"" seen in the engine that failed.

The CBOE market volatility index fell 5.7 percent to 15.71 in a sign of reduced investor uncertainty. Stocks have been under pressure of late as investors, worried about high valuations and uncertainty around the world, pulled back from riskier assets. Before Friday's rally, the S&P 500 had given up more than 4 percent while the small-cap Russell was down 7 percent over the past four weeks.Markets rallied after Russia's Defense Ministry said Friday it had finished military exercises in southern Russia, which the United States had criticized as a provocative step amid the Ukraine crisis.""The market hates uncertainty, and when it doesn't have enough information about how badly an event could impact the economy, it tends to take the worst-case scenario and people sell off,"" said Malcolm Polley, president and chief investment officer of Stewart Capital Advisors in Indiana, Pennsylvania. ""With the news of the de-escalating in Russia, and also with the administration saying exactly what they are doing in Iraq, it's helped clear up some uncertainty in the market.""Earlier on Friday, the United States carried out air strikes targeting Islamic State fighters marching on Iraq's Kurdish capital. The strikes were the first authorized on Iraq since President Barack Obama pulled American troops out in 2011.The Dow Jones industrial average rose 182.52 points, or 1.12 percent, to 16,550.79.

290,"  WASHINGTON Aug 13 The U.S. Defense Department on Wednesday said it had further eased limits on flights of some Lockheed Martin Corp F-35 fighter jets that were imposed after a June 23 engine failure that grounded the F-35 fleet for over three weeks.The Pentagon also said it was making progress in separate contract negotiations with both prime contractor Lockheed, and enginemaker Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp  , for the next batches of aircraft and engines.The twenty-plus F-35 test planes in the U.S. fleet will now be able to fly six hours between engine inspections for aerial refueling missions and weapons testing, up from three hours, said F-35 program office spokesman Joe DellaVedova.Other test flights and flights of dozens of F-35 training aircraft operated by the Air Force and Marine Corps are still subject to the three-hour mandatory engine inspections that were implemented after the engine mishap, he said. The Pentagon had already relaxed some flight restrictions on the test aircraft last month, allowing them to resume flying at speeds of 1.6 Mach, up from 0.9 Mach.Training jets operated by the U.S. Air Force and Marine Corps remain subject to speed limits that were in place even before the engine incident, which prevented the jet's debut at two UK air shows last month. DellaVedova said military officials continued to investigate the root cause of the June 23 incident in which the engine on an Air Force training jet broke apart and caught fire just before takeoff from Eglin Air Force Base in Florida.He said contract negotiations between the F-35 program office and the two companies were ""progressing"" but gave no indication when those deals could be signed. Lockheed is in talks with the Pentagon about a contract for an eighth batch of 43 fighter planes. Pratt is negotiating with the Pentagon about the seventh and eighth batches of engines, which the government buys separately.Air Force Lieutenant General Chris Bogdan, who runs the F-35 program for the Pentagon, earlier this year said he expected to reach agreement with both companies by late May or early June, although he told reporters at the time that he would ""not rush into a bad deal.""Bogdan is due to speak to a conference of F-35 suppliers this week as the Pentagon continues work with Lockheed, Pratt and other contractors to drive down the cost of the F-35, the Pentagon's costliest new weapons program.

291,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Lockheed Martin Corp met with 90 key suppliers last week to brainstorm ways to lower the long-term cost of operating and maintaining the F-35 fighter jets from the Pentagon's current forecast of $1.02 trillion through 2065.Top officials from the Pentagon's Defense Contracts Management Agency and the Defense Contracts Audit Agency were also on hand during two days of talks in Fort Worth, Texas. Tom Owen, vice president of F-35 sustainment strategies for Lockheed, told Reuters the meeting was ""an initial, early step"" toward mapping out specific measures to cut the plane's hefty sustainment costs.    ""We are laser-focused on identifying the cost drivers for the F-35 air system and what we can do to reduce those costs as much as possible,"" Owen said, noting that industry-government relations were more collaborative than in past years.    ""It's in everybody's interest to make this aircraft more affordable to build and more affordable to sustain,"" he said.    The trillion-dollar so-called ""sustainment"" price tag for the Joint Strike Fighter, the Pentagon's costliest weapons program, comes on top of the $399 billion projected cost of developing and buying 2,457 jets for the U.S. military in coming decades.     Lockheed, the prime contractor on the program, and key suppliers Northrop Grumman Corp and Britain's BAE Systems last month said they would spend $170million over two years to reduce the cost of producing the warplanes to under $80 million each by 2019.    But the longer-term cost of flying and servicing the planes continues to vex the Pentagon, the contractors, and engine maker Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp, which has a separate contract with the government for the F135 engines that power the new warplane. Owen said suppliers at the meeting heard ""encouraging words"" from U.S. Air Force Lieutenant General Chris Bogdan and other government officials about the program, despite an engine failure that grounded the fleet for over three weeks this summer.    One idea discussed in Fort Worth was the use of multiple-year contracts, and eventual adoption of performance-based logistics contracts, under which the supplier would be responsible for maintaining weapons and ensuring certain reliability levels, rather than paying for item-by-item repairs.  Such deals give incentives to suppliers to drive costs down even further, Owen said.    Multi-year contracts would make it easier for suppliers to invest in process and hardware improvements, he said.     Owen said Lockheed hoped to gradually shift into such arrangements with the government and its suppliers in coming years, but would need approval from Congress and the Pentagon.     F-35 program officials also met with representatives from the Pentagon's Defense Contracts Management Agency and the Defense Contracts Audit Agency, said Joe DellaVedova, a spokesman for the F-35 program office.          It was critical for the program to create ""the right framework"" to help drive costs lower, he said.     Mark Buongiorno, who heads Pratt's domestic and after market business development, said production and sustainment of theF135 engine were closely integrated since original and replacement parts could be ordered together.    ""We have one supply chain and that allows us to leverage the overall volume, which benefits the 'war on cost' and drives down the price,"" Buongiorno said.    He said Pratt was also in talks with the Pentagon about a performance-based logistics system, which could help lower costs across the board.

292,"   By Lewis Krauskopf  United Technologies Corp's Pratt & Whitney unit briefly suspended delivery of the engine for the F-35 Joint Strike  Fighter jet in May because of questions about titanium provided to a parts supplier.Pratt said on Friday it discovered conflicting documentation in late May that raised questions about the origin of the titanium, which was also used in parts for engines made by its Pratt & Whitney Canada division. The Lockheed Martin Corp F-35 strike fighter is the Pentagon's costliest weapons program.Pratt determined very quickly that the material did not pose a flight safety risk, company spokesman Matthew Bates said in an emailed statement.""While the tested material may not meet every Pratt & Whitney material control standard, our engine designs have significant amounts of margin and, based on our engineering assessments, such material does not pose a risk to safety of flight,"" Bates said. Joe DellaVedova, a spokesman for the F-35 program office, agreed that the material does not pose a risk to flight safety and said the part ""will be replaced by attrition.""Bates said Pratt reported its concerns at the time to the U.S. Pentagon's Defense Criminal Investigation Services unit, the Air Force Office of Special Investigations and the U.S. Attorney’s Office. A federal investigation is being conducted into the source of the titanium, whose origin remains unknown, DellaVedova said.Pratt said it was no longer accepting parts made from material provided by the supplier, A&P Alloys. A&P Alloys did not immediately respond to requests for comment late on Friday.  Bloomberg News initially reported the titanium issue.Engine deliveries for the F-35 program have been suspended since a separate June 23 incident, in which the engine on an Air Force training jet broke apart and caught fire just before takeoff from Eglin Air Force Base in Florida. Company and military officials are investigating the cause of the Eglin incident.

293,"  * Defence ministry seeks 3.5 pct spend increase* China's defence budget nearly three times Japan's* Stealth fighters, drones and sub on shopping list* Another destroyer wanted for North Korea defence   (Adds details, context from fifth paragraph)By Kiyoshi TakenakaTOKYO, Aug 29 Japan's defence planners are seeking their biggest budget ever for the coming fiscal year to pay for stealth fighters, drones and a hi-tech submarine, as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe bolsters the military amid an intensifying rivalry with China.The Defense Ministry on Friday requested a 3.5 percent increase to 5.05 trillion yen ($48.7 billion) for the year starting next April. If approved, this third increase in a row will more than reverse the decade of cuts that Abe ended after coming to office in December 2012.The hawkish premier, taking a more assertive stance on national security, has also ended a ban on Japanese soldiers fighting abroad and eased curbs on weapons exports.By testing the constraints of Japan's pacifist postwar constitution, Abe has angered some neighbours, especially Beijing, which accuses him of reviving the nation's wartime militarism.Japan, in turn, is wary of the rapid military buildup in China, which has overtaken Japan in recent years as the world's second-biggest economy. Beijing's military budget has jumped fourfold over the past decade to 808 billion yuan ($132 billion), nearly triple Japan's. In recent years, Sino-Japanese tensions have ramped up over the ownership of a group of uninhabited islets in the East China Sea. Patrol ships and military planes from both countries now routinely shadow each other in the area.In an bid to better protect remote islands, Japan's Defense Ministry wants to buy six F-35 stealth fighters from Lockheed Martin Corp as well as 20 P-1 patrol planes from Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd - a bulk purchase to cut per-unit cost.The government says procurement reform, including bulk purchases for multi-year projects, will save 700 billion yen over five years. SUBS, DRONES, DESTROYERS In another request meant to patrol the waters plied by China, the ministry is seeking 64.4 billion yen for an upgraded Soryu class submarine that can stay submerged far longer than the boat of the same class it requested for this fiscal year for 20 percent less.The new sub has a propulsion system using long-running lithium-ion batteries, replacing one that used liquid oxygen to run a diesel engine, allowing it to stay underwater for around two weeks. The new design allows a ""significant extension to the submarine's ability to stay submerged,"" said a ministry official.Australia has said it is interested in the Soryu design as a possible replacement for its Collins class subs, which need to suck air through a snorkel at the surface when they use their diesel engines while submerged. Japan's shopping list also includes unmanned surveillance planes and tilt-rotor aircraft that take off and land like a helicopter but fly like a plane, as Japan aims to boost its monitoring and troop-deployment capabilities.The ministry does not specify which models of tilt-rotor aircraft and unmanned drones it has in mind because talks with potential suppliers are still going on, but the V-22 Osprey, built by Boeing Co and Bell Helicopter, is the only tilt-rotor plane in military use - including by U.S. forces in Japan.Besides the cutting-edge weapons, the budget request is boosted by the planned replacement of ageing government planes, used for purposes like the prime minister's overseas trips - akin to the U.S. president's Air Force One - with two of Boeing's 777-300ER jets.When expenses for the new government planes and costs  associated with the realignment of U.S. forces in Japan are excluded, the budget request comes to 4.9 trillion yen, up 2.4 percent from this year.The Defense Ministry is also eyeing North Korea, seeking its seventh destroyer equipped with the Aegis ballistic-missile defence system.""We will fortify our system of defending the whole of our country continuously and in a multi-layered fashion against ballistic missile attacks,"" the ministry said in a statement.Much of the Japanese archipelago sits within the range of North Korea's mid-range Rodong missiles. The ministry's latest white paper calls Pyongyang's military activity a grave destabilising factor for Japan and the rest of the world.The submission of the initial budget request will be followed by a series of negotiations between the Defence and Finance ministries ahead of the compilation of the government's budget bill at the end of the year.

Talks about the next two batches of engines should finish soon, he said.Bogdan lauded Pratt for dedicating its ""A team"" to solve the engine issue, and said the company also ""did everything right"" in an issue with faulty titanium supplied by A&P Alloys Inc. He said Pratt would pay to replace a limited amount of titanium affected by the incident.  Pratt and the F-35 program office last week said the metal did not pose a risk to flight safety. Bogdan said there was no link between the engine failure and the titanium supply issue.   Bogdan said the engine incident was a ""low to moderate"" challenge, but it had put the overall F-35 development program about 30 to 45 days behind schedule.He said the engine failure was due to the excessive rubbing of one fan blade on an adjacent seal during a certain maneuver that created higher than expected temperatures in the engine. Bogdan said six of 21 F-35 test planes had been cleared to fly a full flight envelope, and he hoped to get approval for the rest by the end of the month to keep the test program on track.He said officials next week planned to flight test a complex manuever that could ""burn in"" the affected seal on newer engines and avoid the excessive rubbing that caused the engine to fail.Pratt is also due to finish a prototype fan section replacement by the end of the month with pre-set trenches, which could be tested by mid-October.

297,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON, Sept 5  WASHINGTON, Sept 5The U.S. government hopes to hammer out an agreement with South Korea by the end of the year for the U.S. unit of Britain's BAE Systems Plc to carry out $1 billion-plus of upgrades to more than 130 F-16 fighter jets, sources familiar with the discussions said this week.The U.S. Air Force has been leading talks with Seoul about the second phase of a contract won by BAE in 2012, when it beat out F-16 maker Lockheed Martin Corp to upgrade 134 of South Korea's fighter jets for $1.3 billion.BAE, the first non-original equipment maker to win such an F-16 upgrade order, is already developing the design for the upgrades under a $140 million contract that includes new radars, mission avionics, higher resolution screens and new weapons.But the two sides are trying to finalize the pricing and schedule of the second phase of the contract, given some changes requested by South Korea that have increased the cost, said the sources, who were not authorized to speak publicly about the discussions.""The question now for BAE, the U.S. government and the South Korean government is, can we fulfill the requirements the South Koreans are asking for at the price they're asking for,"" said one of the sources. The source said South Korea had budgeted money for the project this year, and the goal was to conclude the current negotiations before the end of the year.""It's a normal part of any FMS program,"" said the second source, when asked about the discussions. ""The basic scope of the contract isn't changing. I wouldn't expect to see a significant increase in the price.""Air Force spokeswoman Ann Stefanek said the U.S. government routinely communicates with other countries about weapons systems upgrades and procurements, but declined to address any specific communications between the Air Force and South Korea.

298,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) is in the final stages of negotiations with the Pentagon about an eighth batch of F-35 fighter jets, with an agreement weeks or perhaps only days away, a company executive and a senior military officer said Tuesday.The deal, valued by analysts at over $4 billion, will cover 43 of the most advanced U.S. warplanes. Lockheed is building three models of the Joint Strike Fighter, or Lightning II, for the U.S. military and nearly a dozen foreign countries.The Defense Department expects to spend nearly $400 billion to develop the radar-evading plane and buy 2,457 jets in coming decades. It is the largest U.S. and global weapons program.Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp (UTX.N), is also close to a deal worth over $1 billion for 84 engines, but that will be cleared only after Pratt and the government determine the cause of an engine failure that grounded the F-35 fleet for weeks this summer. Industry and Pentagon officials said the engine issue was being addressed and should not affect the Marine Corps' plan to start using the jets in combat starting next July.Orlando Carvalho, executive vice president of Lockheed's aeronautics division, told the Reuters Aerospace and Defense Summit the company was in touch daily with the Defense Department about a few remaining issues in the contract talks.""We are in the endgame of the negotiation,"" he said. ""Our hope is that we'll close shortly. I'll say weeks ... maybe if we're a little bit lucky, days."" Pentagon officials originally hoped to conclude the current round of contract negotiations with Lockheed and Pratt by late May or June, but the talks were delayed after an engine failure and fire on an F-35 A-model jet at a Florida air base in June.Rear Admiral Randy Mahr, F-35 deputy program director, told the summit at Reuters' Washington bureau that a deal with Lockheed could be finalized in coming days or weeks, followed by a Pratt deal once the engine issue had been resolved.Mahr said the Pentagon had also decided to negotiate the next two production contracts with Lockheed at the same time to ensure higher order quantities and better pricing. He said those contracts would still be awarded to the company one year at a time given the U.S. budget process and tight restrictions on multi-year contracts. Carvalho said the ninth and 10th batches of the F-35 were expected to include 154 aircraft, which would help provide stability to the company's suppliers. He said Lockheed hoped to segue into true multi-year agreements that contained more assurances once the plane reaches full production in 2018.Lockheed and the Pentagon negotiated a deal for the sixth and seventh batches of jets at the same time several years ago, and Pratt & Whitney is now in talks about two years' worth of engines.Lockheed shares rose more than 0.50 percent after Carvalho's comments, but eased to close up just 17 cents, or 0.10 percent, at $174.90 on the New York Stock Exchange. Mahr said the overall F-35 program was doing ""pretty well"" but said he continued to worry about the pace of retrofitting existing jets to fix problems discovered during flight testing.He said the Pentagon is also trying to increase how often the new jets are available for operational use. The goal was to boost the ""availability rate"" to 57 percent by the end of the year, up from rates of around 30 percent to 40 percent now.Mahr said current rates were low because some components were not lasting as long as expected. The rates also include jets that are out for repairs and those whose engines must be inspected every three hours after the June engine failure.Carvalho said top executives from Lockheed, Pratt & Whitney, Britain's BAE Systems (BAES.L) and Northrop Grumman Corp (NOC.N) were also in talks about driving down the cost of operating and maintaining the jets, which the Pentagon has estimated will reach over $1 trillion over the next five decades.Mahr said the Pentagon was considering one proposal for trimming operating costs that was modeled on a ""Blueprint for Affordability"" announced in July under which Lockheed and other key suppliers will invest $170 million to drive down production costs, but can recoup the money if the measures work out.

301,"  (Adds military comments)By Andrea ShalalWASHINGTON, Sept 9 United Technologies Corp's  Pratt & Whitney unit said the ""root cause"" of the June 23 engine failure on a Lockheed Martin Corp F-35 fighter jet should be clear by the end of September, which would pave the way for over $1 billion in contracts for another 84 engines.Engine maker Pratt & Whitney said it has delivered six of its F135 engines to the U.S. government since Aug. 29, when it resumed deliveries that had been halted after the June incident which grounded the F-35 fleet for weeks and prevented its international debut.Bennett Croswell, president of Pratt & Whitney Military Engines, said he still hoped to keep the government's flight test plan on track through a series of measures aimed at addressing the issue and lifting restrictions on test aircraft.""I believe that through the combination of things we will keep the flight test program on track,"" Croswell told the Reuters Aerospace and Defense Summit.Separately at the Reuters summit, officials from the military and Lockheed echoed the timeline for identifying the cause of the engine incident.""We're reasonably confident we're looking at the right thing, and then we're reasonably confident it's going to prove out in the next couple of weeks,"" Rear Admiral Randy Mahr, deputy director of the F-35 program, told the summit. In June, an Air Force F-35A training jet caught fire after its Pratt engine broke apart and ripped a fuel line as the jet prepared to take off from Eglin Air Force Base in Florida. U.S. officials blame the incident on excessive rubbing of part of the engine's fan section against an adjacent seal.The incident has raised fresh concerns about the $400 billion F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program, the Pentagon's largest-ever arms program, which is about 70 percent over initial cost estimates and years behind schedule.U.S. officials say the program is back on track after earlier problems, although Air Force Lieutenant General Chris Bogdan last week said the engine issue had put the development program about 30 to 45 days behind schedule.Croswell said Pratt was taking the issue very seriously and expected it to be resolved ""in relatively short order."" He also noted that such problems were meant to be found during the design and development phase of any new program. The fix should be moderate in cost, Croswell said.""It should not be a very expensive solution,"" he said, noting that retrofits would be possible without an expensive tear-apart of the F-35's powerful engine.Croswell said Pratt had essentially wrapped up negotiations with the Pentagon on the 84 engines in the seventh and eighth low rate production contracts, but Bogdan wanted a clearer understanding of the root cause of the incident before signing off on an agreement valued at over $1 billion.The Pentagon is negotiating a separate contract with Lockheed for an eighth batch of jets. Croswell confirmed that Pratt would pay to fix the current issue and said the company had also agreed to share in the cost of future problems, but details were still being finalized.""We have agreed in principle to provide a warranty to the U.S. government for future LRIP contracts. We have not yet finalized a warranty agreement, but P&W would likely pay a percentage of the total cost of certain performance specification shortfalls,"" spokesman Matthew Bates said.Croswell said the engine failure came about eight hours after an unusual maneuver involving a roll, yaw and heavy gravity loads during sharp turns. ""This is a maneuver that the engine should be able to withstand,"" he said.Croswell said Pratt had already completed a baseline test  of the current engine at its West Palm Beach, Florida facility, and had begun testing possible fixes. He said the company was investigating whether the density of the polyimide, a rubbery material made by Dupont, had played a role.The part that broke apart ties the fan blades together.

308,"  (Official correction to final two paragraphs to clarify which component made by Cobham Plc)By Andrea ShalalWASHINGTON, Sept 9 United Technologies Corp's  Pratt & Whitney unit said the ""root cause"" of the June 23 engine failure on a Lockheed Martin Corp F-35 fighter jet should be clear by the end of September, which would pave the way for over $1 billion in contracts for another 84 engines.Engine maker Pratt & Whitney said it has delivered six of its F135 engines to the U.S. government since Aug. 29, when it resumed deliveries that had been halted after the June incident which grounded the F-35 fleet for weeks and prevented its international debut.Bennett Croswell, president of Pratt & Whitney Military Engines, said he still hoped to keep the government's flight test plan on track through a series of measures aimed at addressing the issue and lifting restrictions on test aircraft.""I believe that through the combination of things we will keep the flight test program on track,"" Croswell told the Reuters Aerospace and Defense Summit.Separately at the Reuters summit, officials from the military and Lockheed echoed the timeline for identifying the cause of the engine incident.""We're reasonably confident we're looking at the right thing, and then we're reasonably confident it's going to prove out in the next couple of weeks,"" Rear Admiral Randy Mahr, deputy director of the F-35 program, told the summit. In June, an Air Force F-35A training jet caught fire after its Pratt engine broke apart and ripped a fuel line as the jet prepared to take off from Eglin Air Force Base in Florida. U.S. officials blame the incident on excessive rubbing of part of the engine's fan section against an adjacent seal.The incident has raised fresh concerns about the $400 billion F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program, the Pentagon's largest-ever arms program, which is about 70 percent over initial cost estimates and years behind schedule.U.S. officials say the program is back on track after earlier problems, although Air Force Lieutenant General Chris Bogdan last week said the engine issue had put the development program about 30 to 45 days behind schedule.Croswell said Pratt was taking the issue very seriously and expected it to be resolved ""in relatively short order."" He also noted that such problems were meant to be found during the design and development phase of any new program. The fix should be moderate in cost, Croswell said.""It should not be a very expensive solution,"" he said, noting that retrofits would be possible without an expensive tear-apart of the F-35's powerful engine.Croswell said Pratt had essentially wrapped up negotiations with the Pentagon on the 84 engines in the seventh and eighth low rate production contracts, but Bogdan wanted a clearer understanding of the root cause of the incident before signing off on an agreement valued at over $1 billion.The Pentagon is negotiating a separate contract with Lockheed for an eighth batch of jets. Croswell confirmed that Pratt would pay to fix the current issue and said the company had also agreed to share in the cost of future problems, but details were still being finalized.""We have agreed in principle to provide a warranty to the U.S. government for future LRIP contracts. We have not yet finalized a warranty agreement, but P&W would likely pay a percentage of the total cost of certain performance specification shortfalls,"" spokesman Matthew Bates said.Croswell said the engine failure came about eight hours after an unusual maneuver involving a roll, yaw and heavy gravity loads during sharp turns. ""This is a maneuver that the engine should be able to withstand,"" he said.Croswell said Pratt had already completed a baseline test  of the current engine at its West Palm Beach, Florida facility, and had begun testing possible fixes. He said the company was investigating whether the density of the polyimide, a rubbery material made by Dupont, had played a role. That material is applied to a stator vane made by Cobham Plc, which helps direct the air flow in the engine.The component that broke apart ties the fan blade assembly together. Pratt said that part is made by two separate companies but declined to identify them.Follow Reuters Summits on Twitter @Reuters_Summits(For more summit stories, see    (Additional reporting by Lewis Krauskopf; Editing by Leslie Adler)",2014-09-10,LMT,"Wed Sep 10, 2014 | 5:26pm EDT",CORRECTED-(OFFICIAL)-REUTERS SUMMIT-Pratt sees clarity on 'root cause' of F-35 engine issue by end Sept.,http://www.reuters.com//article/aero-summit-pratt-reuters-summit-update-idUSL1N0RA22C20140910?type=companyNews

""This marks the end of the assembly process for the spacecraft.""An unmanned version of the gumdrop-shaped Orion capsule, which has been under construction for three years, is due to launch aboard a United Launch Alliance Delta 4 Heavy rocket on Dec. 4 from nearby Cape Canaveral Air Force Station.United Launch Alliance is jointly owned by Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing Co. In December Orion will be flown to an altitude of about 3,600 miles (5,800 km) from Earth, 14 times farther away than the International Space Station.The capsule will then careen back toward the planet, slamming into the atmosphere at 20,000 mph (32,000 kph). At that speed, Orion's thermal protection system should heat up to about 4,000 degrees Fahrenheit (2,200 degrees Celsius), proving the shield can protect astronauts returning from the moon and other deep-space destinations. Orion is part of NASA's follow-up program to the now-retired space shuttles that will allow astronauts to travel beyond the International Space Station, which flies about 260 miles (418 km) above Earth.A test flight with crew aboard is set for 2021. NASA intends to use the rocket and Orion to fly astronauts to an asteroid that has been robotically relocated into a high orbit around the moon. Eventually, the U.S. space agency wants to fly a four-member crew to Mars. NASA has been out of the human space launch business since the shuttle program ended in 2011.The agency currently buys rides for space station crew members aboard Russian Soyuz capsules. A heated three-way competition to build a U.S.-based commercial space taxi is also under way. The contenders are privately owned Space Exploration Technologies, also known as SpaceX, privately owned Sierra Nevada Corp and Boeing.Work on the Orion deep-space capsule, built by Lockheed Martin, began more than a decade ago under NASA's defunct Constellation moon program.

319,"  WASHINGTON, Sept 15 A joint venture of Boeing Co  and Lockheed Martin Corp plans to announce on Wednesday that it will team up with Blue Origin, a company run by Amazon.com Inc founder Jeff Bezos, to develop a new rocket engine, a source familiar with the plans said.Officials at Boeing and Lockheed declined comment. No comment was immediately available from Blue Origin or United Launch Alliance (ULA), the Boeing-Lockheed venture that uses Russian-built engines to power some of its rockets.ULA had sent out a request for information asking the U.S. aerospace industry earlier this year for ideas on how to replace the Russian-built RD-180 that powers ULA's heavy-lift Atlas 5 rockets, which are used to launch many U.S. military and spy satellites.Tensions with Russia over its actions in Ukraine have raised concerns that Russia could cut off deliveries of the RD-180 engines, according to U.S. officials, who hope to start funding work on a U.S. alternative in the Pentagon's 2016 budget.The partnership agreement will pit Bezos against Elon Musk, founder and chief executive of Space Exploration Technologies Corp, or SpaceX, which is seeking certification from the Air Force for its own Falcon 9 rockets. The certification was due to be completed by the end of this year, but may now slip into next year, according to U.S. officials. They said the process may be slowed while officials look into the recent explosion of a SpaceX experimental rocket that uses the same engine as the Falcon 9.SpaceX is also competing with Boeing and privately held Sierra Nevada Corp. for a NASA contract to ferry astronauts to and from the international space station.NASA is expected to award that contract to one or more bidders on Tuesday, according to two sources familiar with the process. Boeing is poised to win the lion's share of that work, according to the Wall Street Journal, which also reported the expected ULA teaming agreement with Bezos.Boeing would benefit from development of a new U.S. alternate rocket engine, since its commercial crew capsule would also be launched by the Atlas 5 rocket, industry officials said. Pentagon acquisition chief Frank Kendall this month said U.S. officials were looking at a joint government-industry development of a U.S. rocket engine and other options to reduce U.S. reliance on Russian-built engines.Despite the concerns, Russia has continued to deliver RD-180 engines to the United States, with two engines arriving last month and three more slated for delivery this fall.ULA says it has enough RD-180 engines on hand to last for two years. It has an $11 billion contract with the U.S. Air Force for 36 launches, but SpaceX, has sued in federal claims court to be allowed to compete for more of that work.(Reporting by Andrea Shalal; Editing by Matt Driskill)",2014-09-16,LMT,"Mon Sep 15, 2014 | 11:47pm EDT",Boeing-Lockheed venture said teaming with Bezos on rocket engine,http://www.reuters.com//article/boeing-lockheed-martin-bezos-idUSL1N0RH06Y20140916?type=companyNews
320,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON United Launch Alliance (ULA), a Boeing Co and Lockheed Martin Corp joint venture, said on Wednesday it would invest heavily in a new rocket engine being developed by Amazon.com Inc founder Jeff Bezos and his company Blue Origin.The new engine, called the BE-4, could be ready for use in four years, and would cost substantially less than the Russian-built RD-180 engine now used to power ULA's heavy-lift Atlas 5 rockets, officials from both companies told reporters.The U.S. government is grappling with how to reduce its reliance on the Russian-built engines, a matter of growing concern this year after Russia' actions in Ukraine. The announcement showed mounting pressure on ULA, the sole rocket launch provider for most U.S. military and spy satellites, to lower costs as it faces growing competition from another entrepreneur, Elon Musk, and his firm Space Exploration Technologies.SpaceX is seeking Air Force certification of its Falcon 9 rocket, and plans to release its own heavy-lift rocket to compete with ULA's Atlas 5 next year.""It's really time for our country to move toward an all-American launch vehicle, and I can't think of a better way to get on that path,"" said Tory Bruno, chief executive of ULA.Bruno told reporters ULA had a two-year supply of Russian engines, with 11 more to be delivered later this year and next. He said he did not expect problems with those deliveries, despite the company's decision to develop a U.S. alternative. Bezos, a well-known technology entrepreneur, said he was excited to work on the project with ULA, which just carried out its 88th consecutive, successful launch. He said the engine could pave the way toward a future in which ""millions of people"" lived and worked in space.Pentagon acquisition chief Frank Kendall said he had not been fully briefed on the initiative, but called it an example of the innovative and creative ideas the military was seeking on how to end dependence on Russian-built engines.General John Hyten, head of Air Force Space Command, welcomed news that the effort was privately funded, but stressed that any new engine would have to pass a rigorous certification process, like the one SpaceX is undergoing, before it could be used to launch expensive and critical satellites into space. ""I’m not sure which way we're (ultimately) going to go,"" he said.

321,"  (Adds comments from Pentagon chief arms buyer, Air Force general)By Andrea ShalalWASHINGTON, Sept 17 United Launch Alliance (ULA), a Boeing Co and Lockheed Martin Corp joint venture, said on Wednesday it would invest heavily in a new rocket engine being developed by Amazon.com Inc founder Jeff Bezos and his company Blue Origin.The new engine, called the BE-4, could be ready for use in four years, and would cost substantially less than the Russian-built RD-180 engine now used to power ULA's heavy-lift Atlas 5 rockets, officials from both companies told reporters.The U.S. government is grappling with how to reduce its reliance on the Russian-built engines, a matter of growing concern this year after Russia' actions in Ukraine.The announcement showed mounting pressure on ULA, the sole rocket launch provider for most U.S. military and spy satellites, to lower costs as it faces growing competition from another entrepreneur, Elon Musk, and his firm Space Exploration Technologies.SpaceX is seeking Air Force certification of its Falcon 9 rocket, and plans to release its own heavy-lift rocket to compete with ULA's Atlas 5 next year.""It's really time for our country to move toward an all-American launch vehicle, and I can't think of a better way to get on that path,"" said Tory Bruno, chief executive of ULA. Bruno told reporters ULA had a two-year supply of Russian engines, with 11 more to be delivered later this year and next. He said he did not expect problems with those deliveries, despite the company's decision to develop a U.S. alternative.Bezos, a well-known technology entrepreneur, said he was excited to work on the project with ULA, which just carried out its 88th consecutive, successful launch.He said the engine could pave the way toward a future in which ""millions of people"" lived and worked in space. Pentagon acquisition chief Frank Kendall said he had not been fully briefed on the initiative, but called it an example of the innovative and creative ideas the military was seeking on how to end dependence on Russian-built engines.General John Hyten, head of Air Force Space Command, welcomed news that the effort was privately funded, but stressed that any new engine would have to pass a rigorous certification process, like the one SpaceX is undergoing, before it could be used to launch expensive and critical satellites into space.""I'm not sure which way we're (ultimately) going to go,"" he said.

325,"  (Adds byline, reaction from Lockheed, Pentagon F-35 office)By Joyce LeeSEOUL, Sept 24 South Korea will sign a deal this month to buy 40 Lockheed Martin Corp F-35 fighter jets for about 7.34 trillion won ($7.06 billion) for delivery in 2018-2021, two people with knowledge of the transaction told Reuters on Wednesday.South Korea confirmed its March decision, when it became the 10th country to choose F-35 fighter jets to replace aging warplanes and strengthen its defence against restive neighbour North Korea.""We have agreed to acquire 40 jets within the total budget and reflect all the terms negotiated during the 2013 competition,"" South Korea's Defense Acquisition Program Administration said in a statement on Wednesday, after months of tests and negotiations.The additional orders will lower the estimated unit cost of each of the 3,000-plus F-35 fighter aircraft to be bought by the United States and other governments in coming years. Lockheed, engine maker Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp, and other suppliers are investing heavily to drive down the program's projected $400 billion cost.U.S. Air Force Lieutenant General Chris Bogdan, the Pentagon's F-35 program manager, reassured Seoul that a June engine failure would not affect the quality, price, delivery date and safety of its jets, which South Korea is viewing as a sort of guarantee, one person said. Bogdan, in Norway for a meeting with the eight partner countries involved in the program, welcomed Seoul's decision.""This is a good day for the F-35 program and we look forward to working with the Republic of Korea government in executing its F-35 program,"" he said in a statement.Lockheed said initial deliveries of the South Korea jets would begin in 2018, when the first South Korean pilots will also arrive for training at Luke Air Force Base in Arizona. The company said the agreement includes a substantial ""offset"" package, including a military communications satellite that will be launched into orbit and then operated by South Korea, as well as significant technical support for South Korea's K-X program to develop its own domestic fighter jet.One of the sources said South Korea would sign a follow-up contract with the United States to allow basic maintenance of the jets within South Korea. The sources were not authorized to speak the media.South Korea initially planned to spend 8.3 trillion won to buy 60 jets, but reduced the order to 40 jets last year after dropping an option to buy Boeing Co's F-15s in favour of jets with stealth capabilities.The South Korean agency did not have an official comment on the timing of the deal but has previously indicated the third quarter.

328,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) said it will buy a European-built military communications satellite for South Korea as part of a $7 billion deal to supply Seoul with 40 F-35 fighter jets, in what industry observers call among the most unusual ""offset"" agreements ever to accompany a major arms sale.Lockheed, which builds its own satellites, declined to detail the cost of the new satellite or name its manufacturer, but said the spacecraft would provide a ""state-of-the-art"" system that met South Korea's military requirements.""The Lockheed Martin offset commitment ... directly benefits Korean national defense requirements, enables substantial Korean industrial activity and transfers a large amount of high technology to the Republic of Korea,"" Lockheed said.Steve Over, director of international business development for the F-35 program, said Lockheed would buy and launch the satellite by 2017, including all necessary control equipment and technical training. He declined to give further details.U.S. government and industry officials said they believed it was the first time that a U.S. firm had included a satellite in a so-called ""offset agreement"" with an arms deal. In this case, Seoul's offset target was 50 percent of the value of the jets.Weapons sales are generally negotiated between governments, but offset deals are worked out between the company and the purchasing government. A U.S. defense official said the State Department had approved the overall F-35 deal, including any offset costs, but the decision to include the European satellite was ""purely"" that of South Korea and Lockheed. ""The U.S. Department of Defense is not a party to any offset arrangement between U.S. industry and the foreign government,"" said the official, who asked not to be named. Such agreements have long been demanded by countries to ""offset"" the cost of new weapons systems. They pay for a wide array of goods and services, ranging from arms components to unrelated items such as construction of hotels and financing for movies. In one case in 2005, Thailand asked Lockheed to buy 80,000 tons of stockpiled frozen chicken as part of an ultimately unsuccessful bid to sell F-16 fighter jets.Analysts and industry executives say offset deals have grown more sophisticated in recent years, but South Korea's interest in a satellite is a new development. Most of Lockheed's F-35 sales thus far have been with countries that helped fund the plane's development and qualify for industrial participation in the F-35 program, rather than offset deals for unrelated items. Lockheed's two other sales to countries outside the partnership, Israel and Japan, did not include offset arrangements, according to company officials.As part of the offset deal with Seoul, Lockheed will also provide engineering expertise and technical documentation to help South Korea develop its own fighter airplane.Marco Caceres, an analyst with the Virginia-based Teal Group, said the new satellite may be built by France's Thales (TCFP.PA), which has already built several satellites for South Korea. The satellite was likely medium-sized and would cost several hundred million dollars to build, plus another $100 million to launch, he said. The other major European satellite builder is Airbus.Neither company had any immediate comment.Brett Lambert, a former senior Pentagon official, said it was not unprecedented for companies to buy equipment from a third countries as part of offset deals, but it was ironic in this case since Lockheed builds its own satellites and has long called for changes in the U.S. International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) export rules to enable more exports.""It's the last ironic twist of ITAR,"" Lambert said, noting that the U.S. government had finally begun reforming export control laws for satellites and related exports, but the Korean deal may have been shaped before those rules went into effect.

329,"  WASHINGTON Oct 1 The U.S. Air Force is close to announcing the winner of a three-way competition between Lockheed Martin Corp, Raytheon Co and Northrop Grumman Corp to build the next generation of long-range radars, senior military officials said.""We're close. We're working our way through the approval process,"" Air Force Lieutenant General Ellen Pawlikowski, the service's top military acquisition official, told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday.One source familiar with the process said Frank Kendall, the Pentagon's chief arms buyer, had approved the Air Force's acquisition plan for the new radar late Tuesday, and a contract announcement was likely early next week.The announcement will mark the next phase of a program that initially began in 2009, with the Air Force funding work on full-scale prototypes by all three companies. The initial contract will fund continued development and low-rate production of a few radar systems, followed by orders for nearly 30 more. Industry executives also see potential opportunities for selling the system to U.S. allies.Kendall had told Reuters in an interview earlier Tuesday that he was ""not quite finished"" looking at the Air Force's business plan for the Three-Dimensional Expeditionary Long-Range Radar program, or 3DELLR, but an announcement could come soon. The new system will replace the Air Force's current TPS-75 radar, which has been in service since the late 1960s. It will serve as the Air Force' primary long-range, ground-based sensors for detecting and tracking aircraft and missiles. In its request for proposals, the Air Force said it expected the new system to be more accurate, reliable and give air controllers a precise view of aircraft and missiles.Pawlikowski said the Air Force had applied some of the lessons it learned on other large-scale acquisition programs in structuring the next-generation radar program, including efforts to strictly rein in military requirements and funding work on prototypes before choosing a design.Executives at the three companies have been expecting a contract announcement for several weeks.

333,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Oct 2 The U.S. Air Force hopes to translate its recent successes in driving down the cost of huge satellite programs to a range of other weapons, including Lockheed Martin Corp's C-130J transport plane, a top official told Reuters.Lieutenant General Ellen Pawlikowski, who won praise for reversing years of cost increases on big satellite programs in her previous role, hopes to apply those lessons to other programs after she took over in June as the service's top military acquisition official.Pawlikowski has launched a new ""matchmaking"" initiative to bring together industry executives from different weapons programs to compare notes on ways to reduce costs.""This is part of our 'bend the cost curve' initiative. We need to figure out how to continue to afford the systems that we need,"" she told Reuters during an interview this week in her office at the Pentagon.The three-star general will travel to the Marietta, Georgia,  plant next week where Lockheed builds C-130J transport planes  to work with officials there on possible cost-cutting measures.That could help lower the cost of a multibillion-dollar C-130J contract the Air Force is negotiating with Lockheed. Pawlikowski has urged Lockheed's space division to show the company's aeronautics division how it was able to lower the cost of recent orders for Space-Based Infrared System satellites and Advanced Extremely High Frequency satellites by over 30 percent.The Air Force cut the projected cost of the AEHF contract by $1 billion by changing the contract terms, buying two satellites at a time, and changing the order of work on the satellite.Pawlikowski said the Air Force was able to drive down the projected cost of the SBIRS program by several hundred million dollars through a variety of measures, including reducing the amount of government oversight and streamlining the contract. Lockheed said it was eager to work with the Air Force to make its programs more affordable.""We've had success driving down costs on our satellite programs by working with our customers to structure block buys, which give us the benefit of economies of scale. That helps us negotiate better prices with suppliers, maximize the efficiencies in our production line, and take full advantage of the production learning curve,"" said spokesman Matt Kramer.The Air Force has also pushed for greater use of prototypes and computer-based modeling, as well as ""open architecture"" systems that enable easier updates and do not rely on proprietary systems, Pawlikowski said. ""We're not inventing anything new. We're trying to hone our skills,"" she said, noting that the Air Force was also trying to be more precise in determining its priorities, and sticking to them, as it developed new acquisition plans.She said the measures that helped cut costs on satellites and other arms would be included in a contract for a new long-range radar to be awarded soon, and in structuring a program to end U.S. reliance on Russian rocket engines.The Air Force was also looking carefully at the ""Blueprint for Affordability"" initiative launched by Lockheed and other contractors on the $400 billion F-35 fighter jet program to see if it could be applied to other programs, she said.Under the initiative announced this summer, Lockheed and key partners will invest $170 million of their own funds to lower  manufacturing and maintenance costs, but could recoup that money from the government if the savings are actually achieved.(Editing by Ros Krasny and Matthew Lewis)",2014-10-02,LMT,"Thu Oct 2, 2014 | 1:42pm EDT",U.S. Air Force seeks to apply satellite savings lessons to other programs,http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-airforce-arms-idUSL2N0RW3FO20141002?type=companyNews
334,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Raytheon Co (RTN.N) beat out Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) and Northrop Grumman Corp (NOC.N) for a contract to build a next-generation long-range radar system for the U.S. Air Force, the U.S. Defense Department said on Monday.The award marks another significant win for Raytheon in the radar market, a deal valued at around $1 billion, and kicks off the next phase of a program begun in 2009, when the Air Force funded work on full-scale prototypes by all three companies.The new system will replace the Air Force's current TPS-75 radar, which has been in service since the late 1960s. It will serve as the Air Force's primary long-range, ground-based sensors for detecting and tracking aircraft and missiles. The Air Force said the new system would be more accurate, reliable and give air controllers a precise real-time view.Raytheon's initial $19.5 million deal, which runs through Oct. 31, 2018, will cover continued development of the Three-Dimensional Expeditionary Long-Range Radar (3DELRR) program, and construction of three initial systems. The Air Force then plans to buy three more systems for a total of $72 million.Over time, the value of the contract is likely to rise significantly since the Air Force is expected to order 30 more radar systems, and foreign militaries could soon follow suit since the system was designed from the start to allow exports. Loren Thompson with the Lexington Institute said the contract was the latest in ""Raytheon's impressive string of competitive wins"" and marked the third setback in a row for Northrop. ""Raytheon is steadily taking market share in the midst of a defense downturn,"" he said.Air Force Secretary Deborah James said the new radar embodied concepts mapped out in a new strategic framework, including the need to design ""exportability"" into weapons early on to lower the cost of buying and maintaining weapons systems. Raytheon welcomed the news, saying it had developed an ""affordable, exportable radar"" that would meet the requirements of many U.S. allies and could work together with older systems. Raytheon said using gallium-nitride allowed the firm to improve the range, sensitivity and search capabilities of the radar without excessive cost. It also operates in the relatively uncongested C-band of the radio frequency spectrum.""As the U.S. and other countries look to replace aging battlefield radars with low-cost yet cutting edge and highly capable systems, Raytheon's 3DELRR can meet that growing demand,"" said Andrew Hajek, who heads the program for Raytheon. Hajek told Reuters the competition had been ""tough but fair."" He declined to give any financial details.Lockheed said it was disappointed by the news, but said it was waiting for a briefing from the Air Force before deciding whether to protest with the congressional Government Accountability Office (GAO).Northrop said it was disappointed also but declined to comment further.

Kongsberg was seeing higher demand for its air-defense system, he said.Kongsberg, which is celebrating its 200th anniversary this year, is trying to pump up its defense sales in the United States, which accounts for about 35 percent of its annual revenues, as it looks to offset sales in the oil and gas sector.Qvam, who spoke to Reuters during the annual Association of the U.S. Army conference in Washington, said Kongsberg could see billions of dollars in revenues from the NSM missile, a long-range precision strike missile, in coming years. He said the Navy viewed the NSM as a capability that could strengthen the LCS class of coastal warships.  The Navy test-fired a NSM from the USS Coronado, one of its Littoral Combat Ships, last month, striking its target directly.Qvam said he was also upbeat about the future of the Joint Strike Missile, or JSM, which is based on the same technology as NSM. The new missile is planned as part of the Block 4 upgrade of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, built by Lockheed Martin Corp, although it will be optional for buying countries.“Most of the countries buying JSF will be considering a missile of this nature.

Kongsberg planned to continue its acquisition of three to five companies a year to enhance its product portfolio, he said, adding that the current strains could accelerate M&A activity.Qvam said businesses throughout that sector were seeing weakening revenues, but Kongsberg may be insulated given its focus on smaller programs and the relative lack of large industrial base facilities.He said the company was also offering technology to help oil and gas producers reduce costs and improve efficiency.

346,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Lockheed Martin Corp said on Wednesday it had made a technological breakthrough in developing a power source based on nuclear fusion, and the first reactors, small enough to fit on the back of a truck, could be ready for use in a decade.Tom McGuire, who heads the project, said he and a small team had been working on fusion energy at Lockheed's secretive Skunk Works for about four years, but were now going public to find potential partners in industry and government for their work.  Initial work demonstrated the feasibility of building a 100-megawatt reactor measuring seven feet by 10 feet, which could fit on the back of a large truck, and is about 10 times smaller than current reactors, McGuire told reporters.In a statement, the company, the Pentagon's largest supplier, said it would build and test a compact fusion reactor in less than a year, and build a prototype in five years.     In recent years, Lockheed has gotten increasingly involved in a variety of alternate energy projects, including several ocean energy projects, as it looks to offset a decline in U.S. and European military spending.Lockheed's work on fusion energy could help in developing new power sources amid increasing global conflicts over energy, and as projections show there will be a 40 percent to 50 percent increase in energy use over the next generation, McGuire said. If it proves feasible, Lockheed's work would mark a key breakthrough in a field that scientists have long eyed as promising, but which has not yet yielded viable power systems. The effort seeks to harness the energy released during nuclear fusion, when atoms combine into more stable forms. ""We can make a big difference on the energy front,"" McGuire said, noting Lockheed's 60 years of research on nuclear fusion as a potential energy source that is safer and more efficient than current reactors based on nuclear fission.Lockheed sees the project as part of a comprehensive approach to solving global energy and climate change problems.Compact nuclear fusion would produce far less waste than coal-powered plants since it would use deuterium-tritium fuel, which can generate nearly 10 million times more energy than the same amount of fossil fuels, the company said. Ultra-dense deuterium, an isotope of hydrogen, is found in the earth's oceans, and tritium is made from natural lithium deposits.It said future reactors could use a different fuel and eliminate radioactive waste completely.McGuire said the company had several patents pending for the work and was looking for partners in academia, industry and among government laboratories to advance the work. Lockheed said it had shown it could complete a design, build and test it in as little as a year, which should produce an operational reactor in 10 years, McGuire said. A small reactor could power a U.S. Navy warship, and eliminate the need for other fuel sources that pose logistical challenges. U.S. submarines and aircraft carriers run on nuclear power, but they have large fission reactors on board that have to be replaced on a regular cycle.""What makes our project really interesting and feasible is that timeline as a potential solution,"" McGuire said.Lockheed shares fell 0.6 percent to $175.02 amid a broad market selloff.

349,"  (Adds Pentagon statement on engine issues, byline)By Andrea ShalalWASHINGTON Oct 14 The Pentagon on Tuesday said it had finalized a contract with Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp, for a seventh batch of F135 engines for the Lockheed Martin Corp F-35 fighter jet, and the company had agreed to pay to fix an engine issue that grounded the F-35 fleet this summer.The U.S. Defense Department said its new $592 million contract with Pratt would cover 36 engines, adding to an earlier advanced procurement contract worth $88 million. The company also won a maintenance contract worth $263 million in December.Pratt and the Pentagon said they expected to finalize a follow-on contract for an eighth batch of 48 engines in ""the near future.""Air Force Lieutenant General Chris Bogdan, the Pentagon's F-35 program manager, had expected to reach a deal on the engine contracts earlier this summer, but the talks were delayed after the engine on an Air Force F-35 failed during takeoff from a Florida air base on June 23. The incident led to the grounding of the entire F-35 fleet for several weeks and prevented the jets from making their international debut at two UK air shows.Bogdan praised Pratt's work to drive down the cost of the powerful F135 engine, and said the average price of both the conventional Air Force model and a short takeoff version built for the Marine Corps was 4.5 percent lower than in the last one. A similar price reduction was expected in the contract for the eighth batch of engines, according to the joint statement issued by the Pentagon and the company.""We continue to be laser-focused on reducing costs and meeting our delivery schedule commitments,"" said Chris Flynn, vice president, Pratt & Whitney F135/F119 engine programs.As a precursor to the contract, the statement said a joint team investigating the engine failure had met and agreed on the cause of the engine failure: that prolonged rubbing of certain material in a part of the engine had led to small cracks which eventually caused the third stage fan rotor to break apart. The statement said Pratt and the F-35 program office were executing a plan to modify the current operational and test jets, and implement a long-term solution for future jets.As part of the contract for the seventh batch of jets, Pratt agreed to cover the cost of corrective actions for previously delivered engines and modules to fix the engine issue.No details were provided on the exact nature of the fix adopted, or its cost, but officials have said they did not expect the engine modifications to be very expensive.Pentagon officials are negotiating a separate contract with Lockheed that is worth about $4 billion for an eighth batch of the most advanced U.S. warplanes. Lockheed and government officials had told Reuters last month that they expected to reach agreement on that contract within days or weeks.

""We'll get there.""A source familiar with the $399 billion Joint Strike Fighter program, the Pentagon's costliest weapons project, said slower-than-expected deliveries had sparked concern about whether Lockheed would meet its delivery target of 36 jets for the full year. The company could lose incentive fees if it does not, said the source, who was not authorized to speak publicly. The Pentagon's F-35 program office had no immediate comment on the issue.Rein said 12 of the 14 remaining airplanes were on the flight line conducting engine run and flight operations, and had completed final finishes and signature testing. The remaining two jets would complete final finishes by November 3, he said. Two of the jets on the flight line had already completed their acceptance flights, and were now being prepared for acceptance by the U.S. government, he said.Testing and deliveries of the F-35s had been slowed by a three-week fleetwide grounding due to an engine issue that first emerged in June, and also by increased paperwork associated with the shift from the fifth to the sixth batch of jets, Rein said. But the company has faced similar challenges in the past. In December 2012, Lockheed redoubled its efforts and delivered nine jets to the U.S. government.Separately, Lockheed and Pentagon officials have been working to finalize a contract valued at over $4 billion for an eighth batch of jets and ensure it has the support of the various international partners affected.The eighth batch of 43 jets is due to include aircraft for the U.S. military, Italy, Israel, Norway, Britain and Japan.

366,"  WASHINGTON Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) and U.S. defense officials have reached agreement on the terms of a contract worth about $4 billion for an eighth batch of 43 F-35 fighter jets, sources familiar with the deal said on Thursday.The contract will lower the cost of the radar-evading warplane by about 3 percent and includes jets to be built for the U.S. military, Britain and other U.S. allies, according to the sources, who were not authorized to speak publicly.The cost of the U.S. Air Force model of the plane, which accounts for 27 of the 43 aircraft, will go down by nearly 4 percent, said one of the sources.Both sides had expected to reach a deal in May or June, but the negotiations slowed after a June 23 engine failure on an Air Force jet grounded the entire F-35 fleet for several weeks.Lockheed Chief Financial Officer Bruce Tanner told analysts on Tuesday that the company was close to reaching a deal with the Pentagon office that runs the $399 billion weapons program, the costliest arms project. The Pentagon reached an agreement earlier this month with engine maker Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp  (UTX.N), that lowered the cost of the engines that will power the seventh batch of jets by 4.5 percent.Pratt expects to conclude an agreement with similar cost reductions for engines to power the eighth set of jets after the Lockheed deal is finalized. Lockheed, the Pentagon's No. 1 supplier, delivered the first airplane from the sixth lot of jets on Wednesday. It was the 23rd jet to be delivered this year of 36 that are due.Lockheed has said it has a plan to deliver all 36 jets that were slated for this year, despite the grounding earlier this summer and some flight restrictions that remain in place.

Israel bought 19 F-35s for $2.75 billion in 2010, a deal that included options for up to 75 planes. Israeli Defence Minister Moshe Yaalon, visiting the United States last week, placed a preliminary order for about 25 more F-35s, the defense sources said without elaborating on cost.The first batch of planes is scheduled to arrive in Israel between 2016 and 2018, the sources said, noting that the second purchase needs final approval by an Israeli government panel.Israel will benefit from various efforts under way by Lockheed and engine maker Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp to lower the cost to produce the jets, according to U.S. sources familiar with the plans.Israel had hoped to buy as many as 31 jets in the second batch, and could increase its order from 25 if the price comes down further, said one U.S. source, who was not authorized to speak publicly since the order has not yet been finalized. The new order of jets would be delivered beginning in 2019, with terms of the contract to be finalized by year-end, said the sources.The U.S. embassy in Israel had no immediate comment, and the Pentagon's F-35 program declined comment. Lockheed said it would be inappropriate to comment since arms sales are handled on a government-to-government basis. In July, Lorraine Martin, Lockheed's F-35 program manager, told reporters that $170 million of industry investment in cost reduction initiatives will cut the cost of each F-35 fighter jet to about $80 million, including an engine, by 2018. Washington gives Israel some $3 billion in annual defense grants, most of which it spends on U.S. products.

The new order of jets would be delivered beginning in 2019, with terms of the contract to be finalized by year-end, said the sources.The U.S. embassy in Israel had no immediate comment, and the Pentagon's F-35 program declined comment. Lockheed said it would be inappropriate to comment since arms sales are handled on a government-to-government basis.In July, Lorraine Martin, Lockheed's F-35 program manager, told reporters that $170 million of industry investment in cost reduction initiatives will cut the cost of each F-35 fighter jet to about $80 million, including an engine, by 2018.Washington gives Israel some $3 billion in annual defence grants, most of which it spends on U.S. products. Israeli companies, including Elbit Systems Ltd. and state-owned Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI), are contributing technologies to the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program.

376,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Engine maker Pratt & Whitney on Thursday said it had won a contract to build an eighth batch of 48 engines for the F-35 fighter jet built by Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N), bringing the total value of the deal to $1.05 billion.Pratt, a unit of United Technologies Corp (UTX.N), said the new contract was for $793 million, on top of $259 million in preliminary funds awarded and would lower the average cost of the engines between 3.5 percent and 4.5 percent.Air Force Lieutenant General Chris Bogdan, program executive officer for the Pentagon's F-35 program, welcomed the cost cuts in the new contract, which follow an average 4.4 percent cost reduction in the seventh batch of engines.The cumulative reduction of about 9 percent in the two contracts showed Pratt's renewed commitment to the ""war on cost"" it initiated several years ago, Bogdan told reporters at the headquarters of the F-35 program. He said he would continue to press the company for further cuts in the cost of the F135 engine that powers the newest and most advanced U.S. warplane.Neither Pratt nor the Pentagon disclosed the specific cost of each engine under the new contract.  Chris Flynn, who runs the F135 and F119 engine programs for Pratt, said the company and its suppliers remained focused on pushing the price even lower and meeting the goals outlined in the company's cost reduction initiative.""Pratt & Whitney and our supply base remain focused on delivering the F135 propulsion system on or below the cost targets we committed to for our customer,"" Flynn said in a statement. Bogdan said the Pentagon planned to negotiate separate contracts with both Lockheed and Pratt for the ninth and tenth batches of jets and engines in coming months, with a goal of reaching agreement with the companies by the fall of 2015. He reaffirmed the program's goal of reaching a price tag of $80 million to $85 million per aircraft by 2019.In addition, he said the Pentagon and Lockheed expected to generate ""substantial"" cost reductions in the F-35 fighter jets being sold to foreign countries by combining their cumulative orders instead of negotiating one year of orders at a time.That meant that U.S. allies who participated in such a ""block buy"" could for a time see lower F-35 prices than the U.S. military, which must meet certain strict conditions set by Congress to enable multiyear purchases, Bogdan said. In later years, once the F-35 reaches full-rate production, the U.S. military could also shift to multiyear contracts.The changes could drive the cost of the aircraft even lower than the current target of $80 million to $85 million, he said.Bogdan said he was confident that Pratt and the Pentagon had solutions in place that would allow the program to resume normal flight operations after a massive engine failure on June 23 that grounded the entire F-35 fleet for several weeks this summer.

In a statement, Lockheed Martin said the first of the ships will be built in Italy, with the other five built in Taiwan.The U.S. defence firm said it will install and test the combat management system for the ships. Intermarine declined to comment.Mine countermeasure vessels, including mine hunters and mine sweepers, are naval vessels used to clear mines at sea. Local media have reported that the defence ministry's total procurement budget for mine countermeasure vessels is T$35.2 billion Taiwan dollars ($1.2 billion).The United States is Taiwan's largest defence supplier and a major political ally, despite a lack of formal diplomatic ties. China regards Taiwan as a renegade province and resolutely opposes weapons sales to the island.Asked about the deal, China's defence ministry reiterated its objection to weapon sales to Taiwan. ""We resolutely oppose any weapons sales to Taiwan,"" the ministry said in a statement faxed to Reuters.

The sea-based testing of the plane will give officials key data about the ship's performance on a carrier, and allow any adjustments needed to keep the program on track for initial use by the fleet in 2018.Navy test pilot Commander Tony Wilson, who landed the CF-03 aircraft on the Nimitz flight deck just after noon, called it a ""landmark event.""Vice Admiral David Buss, commander of Naval Air Forces, said the landing was ""historic,"" noting that it begins ""the integration of the next generation of warfighting capability into our carrier-based air wings."" The jet, and a second due to arrive later Monday or Tuesday, will carry out two weeks of testing at sea, the first of three testing phases planned for the carrier variant of the F-35.The jets will perform operational maneuvers, including various catapult takeoffs and arrested landings using a tailhook that had be redesigned after early test problems on land. Air Force Lieutenant General Chris Bogdan, who runs the program for the Pentagon, said the Navy, Pentagon and contractors had been preparing for the testing for months. The F-35C will enhance the flexibility, power projection and strike capabilities of carrier air wings, complementing the capabilities of the Boeing Co F/A-18 Super Hornet, the Navy current strike fighter.

But Canada's plans were put on hold in 2012 after a parliamentary watchdog faulted the government's process.  Sources familiar with the issue have told Reuters that a comprehensive review that ended this spring put the jet ahead of the competition and that European bidders were effectively ruled out. They said a decision still had to be made. The latest news, first reported by Canadian media,  rekindled controversy in Parliament, where an opposition lawmaker immediately criticized the Conservative government for appearing to plow ahead with the F-35 purchases and not permitting a more transparent bidding process. Canada announced in September that it would extend the life of its existing CF-18 fighters built by Boeing Co to 2025, instead of retiring them in 2020 as initially planned. Critics suspect the government could delay its decision about new fighters until after a federal election in October 2015. The swap outlined in the Oct. 27 briefing chart would preserve Canada's option to proceed quickly with F-35 orders once that decision is made and announced, said the sources. They said Canada could also begin training F-35 pilots as early as 2016.

An upcoming 16-month deployment of the USS Fort Worth, a new coastal warship built by Lockheed Martin Corp, kicks off a new strategy by the U.S. Navy that it says will save money and help maintain a presence overseas despite tighter budgets.Captain Randy Garner, Commodore of Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) Squadron One, said the Navy planned to have three crews for every two Littoral Combat Ships (LCS), rotating them onto the ships every four months, a big reduction from current staffing levels that allow crews to remain with their ships.""It’s all about giving flexibility to the forward commander, based on how much money we have,"" Garner told Reuters at his office after a tour of the ship, which is due to leave on Monday for Singapore and the Pacific region.  ""It’s an amazing return on the shipbuilding dollar for us, versus what we’ve done in the past,"" he said. The Navy plans to have four LCS ships operating out of Singapore by around 2018.Garner already oversees four LCS ships in San Diego, with four more due to arrive over the next year or so. He said the new ships were meeting key milestones despite concerns raised by  technical challenges that arose during last year's deployment of the first LCS ship, USS Freedom, to Asia. Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican who stands poised to head the Senate Armed Services Committee, and others seized on an April report in which the Government Accountability Office questioned the ships' ability to survive attacks at sea.The Pentagon is reviewing Navy recommendations on whether to upgrade the ships, modify them or switch to a different design.

391,"  The USS Fort Worth, a warship built by Lockheed Martin Corp, is slated to depart on Monday for Asia, where it will operate largely out of Singapore for 16 months, the longest deployment of a U.S. Navy ship in 42 years, Navy officials said.Following are some key facts about the ship, which was commissioned in September 2012 and the crew:Third Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) built for the NavySecond in the Freedom class of ships, which is based on a steel monohull design. Ship will arrive in Singapore by the end of the year for its first deployment. The  first LCS ship, the USS Freedom, was deployed for 10 months in Singapore last year. The Fort Worth has a core crew of 54 people, plus 19 to operate a package of surface-warfare equipment. Twenty-four others serve in the aviation unit that operates a manned MH-60R Seahawk helicopter built by Sikorsky Aircraft, a unit of United Technologies Corp, and an unmanned, autonomous MQ-8B Fire Scout helicopter built by Northrop Grumman Corp.First time that a Seahawk and a Fire Scout will be deployed together aboard a Littoral Combat Ship. The unmanned helicopter has a range of about 100 miles (161 km), extending the ship's ability to monitor its surroundings. A new crew will relieve the first one after four months, with a total of four crews to serve during the 16 months.Navy officials said this would be the longest deployment of a U.S. Navy ship since the carrier Midway was under way for 327 days in 1973 with the same crew. Fort Worth is 390 feet (119 meters) long and has a draft of 13 feet (4 meters), which means it can enter many more coastal areas than the Navy's destroyers, which have a draft of over 30 feet.It is 15 percent more fuel efficient than the USS Freedom, and slightly faster. It can achieve speeds of over 40 knots (74 km per hour).LCS ships were designed to carry out a range of missions, including hunting for mines, submarines and surface warfare, using equipment packages that can be easily swapped out.

395,"   By Andrea Shalal | ABOARD THE USS NIMITZ  ABOARD THE USS NIMITZ Nov 13 The U.S. Navy version of Lockheed Martin Corp's F-35 fighter jet made its first night flight off an aircraft carrier on Thursday as it neared the end of two weeks of sea-based testing aboard the USS Nimitz, Navy and Pentagon officials said.Two F-35 C-model jets on board the carrier have already met 95 percent of the requirements for the first of three rounds of sea-based tests, proving to be more reliable and performing better than expected, Navy test pilots told reporters.By midday Thursday, the jets had carried out over 101 catapult launches from the carrier, 214 planned ""touch and go"" landings, and 104 arrested landings using a redesigned tailhook, according to the F-35 program office. Lockheed is developing and building three F-35 models for the U.S. military and U.S. allies, a $399 billion endeavor that is the most expensive weapons program in the world.The Navy's F-35C model has longer wings that fold up to save space and carries more fuel and weapons. Two more sea-based testing periods are planned for the F-35C in 2015 and 2016 before it can be declared ready for initial combat use in 2018. The jet's successful carrier testing about 100 miles (160 km) south of San Diego comes as the cash-strapped Navy decides how many jets to include in its fiscal 2016 budget request.The C-model costs about $130 million now, but Lockheed and other key contractors are trying to lower the price to about $96 million by 2018, including inflation, by cutting overhead and other measures. Jim Gigliotti, director of F-35C and Navy programs for Lockheed, told Reuters the biggest driver would be a decision by the Navy to buy more than two jets per year. Commander Tony Wilson, one of four test pilots carrying out the flights and maneuvers, said there had been only one ""bolter"" so far, a term for a jet that fails to catch the heavy duty cables used for arrested landings, forcing it to circle around again.""We're conducting the Super Bowl of flight test,"" he said,  adding that no major issues had emerged during 11 test days. ""Everything that we're learning is extremely minor.""Navy officials said the testing was ahead of schedule and could wrap up before the planned finish date of Monday.

397,"   By Dan Williams | JERUSALEM  JERUSALEM Israel may soon order 10 to 15 U.S.-made F-35 fighter jets, around half the number previously mentioned by defence sources in both countries, an Israeli cabinet minister said on Monday.A reduced Israeli purchase could dent international confidence in the plane, which is being developed and built by Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) for the U.S. military and allies - a $399 billion endeavour that is the world's most expensive weapons program.Israel bought 19 F-35s for $2.75 billion in 2010, with delivery scheduled between 2016 and 2018. Defence Minister Moshe Yaalon, visiting the United States last month, agreed to a preliminary deal for 25 to 31 more planes subject to approval by an Israeli ministerial committee, sources said. One committee member, Strategic Affairs Minister Yuval Steinitz, said in an interview there was majority opposition to the scale of Yaalon's order and preference for a smaller purchase of 10 to 15 planes. A final decision is due in the coming days. Steinitz declined to go into detail about the closed-door discussions, but he cited misgivings about whether the F-35's range, payload and manoeuvrability would suit Israel's needs. The Israelis are also husbanding a defence budget that faces cuts, even with some $3 billion in annual U.S. grants.""We are not the Defence Ministry's rubber stamp,"" Steinitz said.An Israeli defence official said the ministerial committee would likely compromise with a staggered plan whereby 13 F-35s would be bought now and another 18 in 2017. The 2010 deal gave Israel the option to buy 75 planes, or three squadrons.  The committee, headed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, has met four times to discuss the purchase, twice extending deadlines on a decision. The delay could mean Israel would incur penalties on Citibank loan guarantees it had arranged to pay for the F-35s. Terms for the loans were due to expire on Nov. 15. F-35 program spokesman Joe DellaVedova said the Pentagon would work to support the Israeli government once it finalised its plans. A source familiar with the program said an Israeli decision to delay some F-35 orders would not derail projected production plans since the jets would have been built later anyway.Another Israeli official linked the resistance Yaalon was meeting from cabinet colleagues to the July-August war in Gaza, which ended inconclusively and triggered calls for more investment in armoured troop carriers and munitions.

399,"  JERUSALEM Nov 17 Israel is likely to place a second order for between 12 and 15 U.S.-made F-35 fighter jets, around half the number previously mentioned by defence sources in both countries, an Israeli newspaper reported on Monday.A reduced Israeli purchase may dent international confidence in the Lockheed Martin Corp plane and set back Israeli efforts to get a lower unit price because of advance orders.Israel bought 19 F-35s for $2.75 billion in 2010, with delivery scheduled between 2016 and 2018. Defence Minister Moshe Yaalon, who visited the United States last month, agreed a preliminary deal for 25 to 31 more planes, subject to approval by an Israeli ministerial committee, sources said.With a decision pending, best-selling daily Yedioth Ahronoth said most of the ministers opposed the scale of Yaalon's order, preferring a smaller purchase of 12 to 15 planes. Government spokesmen had no immediate comment on the Yedioth report. An Israeli defence official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said it was inaccurate, but did not elaborate.Yedioth cited misgivings about whether the F-35's range, payload and manoeuvrability would suit Israel's needs. The Israelis are also husbanding a defence budget which, though buoyed by some $3 billion in annual U.S. grants, faces cuts. Another official said the ministerial committee included Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and four other senior cabinet members, as well as Yaalon. It has met four times to discuss the F-35 purchase, twice deferring deadlines on a decision. The delay could mean Israel incurring penalties on Citibank loan guarantees it had arranged to pay for the F-35s. Terms for the loans were due to expire on Nov. 15, defence sources said.The 2010 F-35 deal gave Israel the option of buying 75 planes in total - three squadrons. The numbers given by Yedioth suggested Israel might get fewer than two F-35 squadrons in the forseeable future, an operational challenge for its air force, which has been tasked with a multitude of regional missions including threatened strikes against Iran's nuclear facilities.The second Israeli official linked the resistance Yaalon was meeting from cabinet colleagues to the July-August war against Palestinian militants in Gaza, which ended inconclusively and pointed to shortfalls in armoured troop carriers and munitions.

Pratt last month said the contract would lower the cost of the engines between 3.5 percent to 4.5 percent.The program office said the new contract reduced the cost of the A-model airframe built for the Air Force, without the engine, to $94.8 million. The cost of the F-35 B-model, which can take off from shorter runways and lands like a helicopter, would be $102 million, without an engine, while the Navy's C-model or carrier variant would be $115.7 million, it said.The Pentagon does not provide detailed cost breakdowns for Pratt's F135 engine, given the company's concerns about proprietary data, but U.S. officials have said they expect the cost of the aircraft, with an engine, to drop to about $80 million to $85 million by 2019. Lockheed's F-35 program manager, Lorraine Martin, said the latest contract showed the company was making steady progress in reducing the cost of the most advanced U.S. warplane.Lockheed and its key subcontractors, Northrop Grumman Corp (NOC.N) and BAE Systems Plc (BAES.L), as well as Pratt, are all investing in various measures aimed at simplifying production of the jets and reducing the cost to build and operate them.

403,"   By Andrea Shalal | PALMDALE Calif.  PALMDALE Calif. Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) expects to reach an agreement next year with a launch customer for a giant new hybrid airship that would revolutionize the way oil and mining companies haul equipment to the Arctic and other remote areas without roads.The initial version of the airship, filled mostly with helium, would carry 20 tons of cargo, but could easily be scaled to roughly the size of a football field with 500 tons of capacity, Robert Boyd, an engineer with Lockheed's Skunk Works R&D house, told Reuters in a rare media visit to the sprawling facility some 60 miles from Los Angeles.Boyd, who started working on airships in 1991, said he was optimistic about finding an initial customer for the manned prototype airship, also known as P-791, next year, nearly a decade after the airship's first flight in 2006. ""We're months away, not days, not years,"" Boyd told Reuters. ""By 2015, we'll be out there on the development track ... By 2018, we should see these in operation.""Lockheed is the Pentagon's No. 1 supplier, but it is targeting a commercial market for the slow-moving airships that have four hovercraft-like landing pads and can set down on nearly any flat surface, including sand, snow and even water. ""It's not the most sexy of airplanes, but it does its job,"" Boyd said.Initial buyers would likely include small airlines or other firms that ship cargo to remote areas for oil, gas or mining companies, he said. He said the aircraft were also very safe because they are filled with helium, which does not burn. He said climate change might boost demand with warmer conditions cutting the time that ice roads could be used.The airships could help countries like Indonesia develop remote territories that lack ports, and could prove useful in providing relief supplies during natural disasters.U.S. military officials had also expressed interest, he said, but would likely contract for cargo transportation services rather than buying the airships themselves. Eventually, Lockheed could sell hundreds of the smaller airships and thousands of the larger ones, Boyd said.He said the airships would likely cost tens of millions of dollars, making their cost comparable to what operators now pay to truck cargo via seasonal ice roads, but about five to 10 times cheaper than much cheaper than transport via helicopters.

The Pentagon projects it will cost $399 billion to develop the plane and pay for 2,457 aircraft for three U.S. military services. In addition, international orders will drive the total number of jets to be built to above 3,000. ""That's their stated requirement from their services,"" Martin said, when asked about Italy's plans. ""We have heard nothing different on what their actual requirement is for a recapitalized fleet.""Martin said a decrease in the number would affect how many aircraft could be assembled at the large ""final assembly and checkout"" plant, or FACO, and in turn, how quickly the cost of those aircraft would come down the ""learning curve."" ""It would have ramifications if they changed their order numbers, primarily for getting up the learning curve at the FACO,"" she added.Martin said most countries ordered weapons as they received authorization or funding for them, which led to a certain ebb and flow in orders, but Lockheed believed the international partners remained confident about the overall program.

It has to be approved by both chambers before going to President Barack Obama for his signature. Lawmakers will be asked to approve it without amendments, the aides said.The measure authorizes a base defense budget of $521 billion, including $17.9 billion for Department of Energy nuclear weapons work, the aides said on condition of anonymity. It also authorizes $63.7 billion in spending on the U.S. war in Afghanistan and the fight against Islamic State rebels in Iraq and Syria. The aides said the funding was at the level sought by the president.The bill would bar United Launch Alliance (ULA), a joint venture of Boeing Co and Lockheed Martin Corp, from using Russian RD-180 engines to send U.S. military and intelligence satellites into space unless they were bought before Moscow's invasion of the Crimean peninsula this year. Already controversial, the supply deal came under new scrutiny in November, when Reuters reported that a tiny company half-owned by Russian engine maker Energomash stands to receive $93 million in cost mark-ups under an RD-180 contract. Those charges are being added to the program despite a 2011 Pentagon audit that contested a similar, earlier contract with the middleman company, Florida-based RD Amross.""Those engines that were already procured under contract at the time of the Crimea invasion are allowed to be used,"" said one aide. ""Anything subsequent to that cannot be used.""ULA has an $11 billion contract with the Air Force for 36 launches. The decision to bar purchases of Russian engines after the Crimean invasion meant ULA could seek competitive bids for 14 launches, the aides said. ULA uses the RD-180 to power its Atlas 5 rockets, but can also use Delta 4 rockets, which do not require the Russian engines, to launch spy and military satellites.ULA spokeswoman Jessica Rye said the RD-180 had been a reliable workforce for the Atlas 5, but the company was working with Blue Origin, a venture run by Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos, to develop a new domestic engine that would be ready by 2019.She said several reports concluded that any effort to ban use of RD-180 engines before a domestic engine was ready would result in billions of dollars of added costs.

412,"  WARSAW Dec 5 A contract won by Lockheed Martin Corp to supply Poland's air force with JASSM long-range air-to-surface missiles is worth about $250 million, the Polish defence ministry said.""The contract signing is planned for December 11. At this stage we only confirm the value ... around $250 million,"" the ministry said in an emailed answer to Reuters questions.Polish officials had previously said the deal had been concluded, but did not say how much it was worth. The missiles will be used to arm Poland's 48-strong fleet of F-16 fighter jets. Poland is an attractive market for defence manufacturers because while many nations are slashing defence spending, Poland is increasing it, and has a $41 billion programme to modernise its armed forces by 2022. Earlier on Friday, Poland's defence minister, Tomasz Siemoniak, told public radio that he expects the signing of a deal for the delivery of 70 helicopters for the Polish army to take place in the first half of 2015. The contract's value is estimated at 10-12 billion zlotys ($2.98-3.57 billion).

415,"   By Andrea Shalal | PALMDALE, Calif.  PALMDALE, Calif. Lockheed Martin Corp, the Pentagon's No. 1 weapons supplier, has rarely felt the need to blow its horn about its secrecy-shrouded crown jewel - until now.""Skunk Works,"" Lockheed's business for developing weapons outside the company's main chain of command, is starting to lift the veil in a sign of fierce pressure to win new orders and protect its brand as military budgets shrink.The pride of Lockheed, Skunk Works has been celebrated since it developed the first jet fighter in 143 days during World War Two to battle the Nazis. But its logo was kept off buildings and employees were barred from saying where they worked.Now, the company has published a glossy brochure with a 10-point “Skunk Works 2015” agenda focused on keeping costs down, working closely with government, and building prototypes. Its officials are meeting in small groups with all 3,300 employees, or ""Skunks"" as they are known, to underscore the importance of staying competitive.Over the past year Skunk Works has invited a few journalists to its most secure facilities, including Palmdale, a site in the high desert 60 miles (100 km) from Los Angeles, where new products range from next-generation unmanned systems to a hypersonic aircraft twice as fast as its Blackbird SR-71 spy plane that could fly across country in just over an hour.Most of the 100 buildings and 3 million square feet of floor space at the site are off-limits, and photography and audio recordings are strictly forbidden, but a tour last month offered a glimpse of some projects.In one building, Lockheed is using the world's largest gantry machine and 3-D printing to build aircraft. Across campus, Lockheed has a giant airship that could deliver cargo to remote areas, and a compact nuclear fusion reactor that could revolutionize power generation.  PRESSURES MOUNT The decision to go public with Skunk Works, albeit modestly, reflects the unprecedented pressures Lockheed faces from tight budgets, nimble smaller competitors and shareholders who prefer dividends and share buybacks to long-term projects. Challenging Skunk Works are such newcomers as Space Exploration Technologies Corp, or SpaceX, which operate more like commercial firms than legacy weapons makers. Their costs are lower due to a younger staff - the average age of SpaceX's engineers is 27, while Lockheed expects half its employees to retire in the next five years - and their ability to leverage commercial orders.Defense consultant Jim McAleese said Skunk Works needed to win orders and cut costs given lower profits in the aeronautics division, where margins fell by about 10 percent last quarter. Aeronautics sales fell 6 percent to $14.1 billion last year.Skunk Works has survived over the years because it is not only an advanced research arm, but also makes money by managing a few signature programs, including the F-22 stealth fighter and other classified programs, general manager Rob Weiss told Reuters. He gave no numbers.Bucking an industry trend, Lockheed is boosting internal R&D spending by 5 percent this year after a 13 percent increase to $697 million in 2013, its highest percentage of sales ever, CEO Marillyn Hewson told analysts in October. She said the rate would rise again in 2015. The Skunk Works outlook could dim if Lockheed loses out on the few big programs up for grabs: a new bomber, a carrier-based drone, and a new Air Force training jet, analysts say.Skunk Works officials say they also need to be more open to strategic partnerships, such as those it has with GenCorp unit Aerojet Rocketdyne and Boeing Co, and new business models, such as fee-for-service deals.Pentagon officials often say they see Lockheed's Skunk Works and Boeing Co's Phantom Works as models for rapid development of weapons and ensuring U.S. military superiority. Deputy Vice President Steve Justice, who has 30 years with Skunk Works, said its historical focus on speed and  affordability was more relevant than ever given the tough budget climate. The proof, he said, came in recent requests from the Navy and others that want to set up similar groups.

416,"  PALMDALE, Calif. Lockheed Martin Corp's Skunk Works was the driving force behind development of many well-known U.S. military aircraft, including the famed ""Blackbird"" or SR-71 spy plane that could fly from New York to Los Angeles in just over an hour.Following are some facts about the Lockheed division, whose Skunk Works name is a registered trademark, and some of the weapons it has or is developing:* Got its start in 1943 when Kelly Johnson and his engineers designed the first fighter jet for the U.S. military in a rented circus tent next to a manufacturing plant, whose strong odors permeated the place. Under orders to keep silent about their work, even when they answered the phone, an engineer responded to a phone call one day by referencing a stinky place called the ""Skonk Works"" featured in the popular Li'l Abner comic strip.* While focused mainly on aircraft, it has developed other weapons, including the Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile that entered service in 2009, and nuclear fusion energy that grabbed headlines several weeks ago. * In the 1950s, developed and built the U-2, a spy plane that flies at 80,000 feet and was fielded within eight months.* In the 1960s, developed the SR-71 ""Blackbird,"" a long-range spy plane that was in use from 1964 to 1998. Designed to operate at three times the speed of sound, it still holds the world record for the fastest air-breathing manned aircraft.* After the downing of U-2 pilot Gary Powers in the Soviet Union in 1960, developed D-21, the first high altitude unmanned spy plane, which carried out four operational missions over China from 1969 to 1971. * In the early 1980s, developed the F-117 Nighthawk, the first operational stealth fighter. Sixty-four aircraft were used in combat, beginning with the U.S. invasion of Panama in 1989. The aircraft were retired in 2008.* In the 1990s, developed the precursors for the F-22 stealth fighter and the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter.* Developed the RQ-170 Sentinel, a tailless, stealthy unmanned aircraft, one of which went down in Iran in December 2011. The Air Force has acknowledged the plane's existence but few details have been released. CURRENT PROJECTS * Teamed with Boeing Co to bid for a huge U.S. Air Force contract to build a new long-range strike bomber.* Developing proposal for a long delayed competition to build an unmanned plane for use on U.S. Navy carriers. * Working with Aerojet Rocketdyne, a unit of GenCorp, on a new High Speed Strike Weapon (HSSW), a hypersonic missile that could be used on future bombers and fighters.* Testing bonds for composite materials used in aircraft, which could reduce use of fasteners that add weight and cost.* Seeking launch customer for new hybrid airship that could be used to deliver 20 tons or more of oil and mining equipment to remote areas, for far less cost than using helicopters, and about the same as current land-based methods.* Working on SR-72, a hypersonic, unmanned plane that would fly twice as fast as the Blackbird.

418,"  (Adds comments by Lockheed, Pratt)By Andrea ShalalWASHINGTON Dec 11 Italy and Turkey will provide initial heavy maintenance of Lockheed Martin Corp's F-35 fighter jet and its engine in Europe from 2018, the Pentagon said on Thursday, paving the way for billions of dollars in work for companies in the two countries.The move reflects the growing maturity of the $399 billion weapons program, with over 120 jets already produced and U.S. and foreign militaries gearing up to start operating the jets around the world in coming years.Air Force Lieutenant General Chris Bogdan, the Pentagon's F-35 program manager, told reporters the decisions came after months of reviews and site visits, and were based on ""best value"" and factors such as location and projected F-35 basing.Bogdan said Italy would do initial heavy maintenance of the jets, which covers structural work on the airframe and significant engine repairs. Britain will provide backup if Italy's F-35 production facility was needed to build more jets than currently planned, he added.Heavy maintenance of the F135 engines that power the supersonic F-35 would be done in Turkey, but Norway and the Netherlands would set up similar sites in two to three years, given the high cost of equipment required for testing, he said.The engines are built by Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp, which said it would work closely with all three countries to establish affordable, world-class depots. Lockheed said it would support the countries as they built up their maintenance capabilities.Bogdan said U.S. maintenance sites were already being set up, and sites in Asia would be named next week. Being able to do heavy maintenance in all three regions will allow commanders to base the jets wherever needed, while ensuring access to repairs.Next year, he said the program would look at components, warehousing, and other elements required for servicing a global fleet of jets that could reach 3,100.Bogdan underscored that other countries buying the jet could bid for additional maintenance in coming years. The total value of maintenance work on the new warplanes could amount to ""hundreds of billions of dollars"" over the next 50 years, Bogdan said, given Pentagon estimates that it will cost the U.S. military over $1 trillion to operate and maintain the 2,457 jets that it plans to buy over that time.Lockheed is developing three variants of the F-35 for the U.S. military and eight partners that funded its development: Britain, Australia, Italy, Norway, Turkey, the Netherlands, Denmark and Canada. Israel, Japan and South Korea have also placed orders for the planes.The Marine Corps plans to start initial combat use of the planes in July 2015, with the Air Force following suit in 2016. In Italy, much of the work will be done by Finmeccanica SpA's Alenia, which manages a $1 billion-plus government-owned final assembly and checkout facility in Cameri.The news cements Italy's commitment to the F-35 program at a time when some lawmakers have suggested further cuts in Italy's F-35 orders, which were already whittled back to 90 jets from 131 several years ago.John Phillips, the U.S. ambassador to Italy, told reporters in Rome that the decision would ""provide a very substantial economic benefit for Italy for decades into the future.""Mauro Moretti, Finmeccanica CEO, said the work would add a large number of jobs and other economic benefits. He said the firm was also vying for F-35 avionics and other components.Norway also welcomed the news and said the work in its country would be done by AIM Norway, a state-owned company.In Turkey, the work is likely to be done by Turkish Aerospace Industries, sources familiar with the matter said.No comments were immediately available from Britain or the Netherlands.

425,"  (Adds details about proposal, comments from Navy officials)By Andrea ShalalWASHINGTON Dec 11 U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel on Thursday approved the U.S. Navy's plan to meet its requirement for 52 small warships by upgrading the coastal warships designed by Lockheed Martin Corp and Australia's Austal, instead of starting from scratch with a more costly new design.Hagel said he accepted the Navy's recommendation to make the current ship designs more lethal and survivable by adding an array of missiles, radars and other equipment.""The Navy's new proposal, like the LCS, will continue to have its critics, but considering the context of our broader naval battle force and the current strategic and fiscal environment, I believe it represents our best and most cost effective option,"" Hagel said in a statement. Hagel ordered a major review of the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) program in February after numerous reports raised concerns that the current ships were not well suited for combat.Navy acquisition chief Sean Stackley told reporters the planned upgrades to the existing ships would add $60 million to $75 million, or less than 20 percent, to the current cost of the ships, pegged at $360 million in the latest signed contracts.Stackley said officials would hammer out details about the upgrades in coming months and planned to finalize a strategy for buying the new ships in time for the fiscal 2017 budget.

426,"  (Adds details of F-35 program, byline)By Andrea ShalalWASHINGTON Dec 17 The Pentagon on Wednesday said it chose both Japan and Australia to carry out heavy airframe maintenance for the Lockheed Martin Corp F-35 fighter jet in Asia, given the high cost of  transporting jets across vast distances in the region.Japan would handle heavy maintenance for the jets in the northern Pacific from early 2018, while Australia would handle maintenance in the southern Pacific, the three-star general who runs the F-35 program for the U.S. Defense Department told reporters.Heavy maintenance of the F135 engine that powers the jet would initially be done in Australia for the Asian region, with a similar site to be set up in Japan after five years, said Air Force Lieutenant General Chris Bogdan. The engine is built by Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp. The news reflects the growing maturity of the $399 billion weapons program, with over 120 jets already produced and U.S. and foreign militaries gearing up to start operating the jets around the world in coming years.Bogdan said the F-35 program office would reexamine the maintenance assignments every two to three years, providing opportunities for other countries with F-35s to benefit from a market valued at billions of dollars in coming years. He said the Pentagon would consider sites for other service work as the F-35 fleet grows, including repairs of components.Last week, the Pentagon said Italy and Turkey would handle initial heavy maintenance in Europe of the F-35 jets and their engines, with Norway and the Netherlands to join Turkey in carrying out engine repairs in coming years. It is also setting up maintenance sites in the United States. Bogdan said countries operating the F-35 could develop their own capacity to handle certain repairs, but heavy maintenance work on the engines and airframes would have to be done at one of the regional maintenance sites. Those sites will be operated under the oversight of the U.S. government, along with Lockheed.Bogdan said U.S. officials opted for two airframe maintenance sites in Asia since transporting jets some 7,000 miles from one site to another would cost too much and require large amounts of refueling support.The general declined comment when asked whether South Korea would have its F-35s serviced in Japan, its former adversary. He said discussions were under way with various countries that are slated to buy F-35s about where their jets would be serviced.(Additional reporting by Timothy Kelly in Tokyo; Editing by Bernard Orr)",2014-12-17,LMT,"Wed Dec 17, 2014 | 5:56pm EST","UPDATE 1-Pentagon picks Japan, Australia to service F-35s in Asia",http://www.reuters.com//article/lockheed-fighter-asia-idUSL1N0U135320141217?type=companyNews

The three nations, all key U.S. allies, are the only countries in the region to have ordered the F-35s.The F-35 program has been lauded as an example of the United States and its allies working together to bolster inter-operability, but in Asia the maintenance plan is bringing traditional rivalry between Seoul and Tokyo to the fore.The three-star air force general who runs the F-35 program for the United States, Chris Bogdan, told reporters on Wednesday that Japan would handle heavy maintenance for the jets in the northern Pacific from early 2018, with Australia to handle maintenance in the southern Pacific.""There will never be a case where our fighter jets will be taken to Japan for maintenance,"" said an official at South Korea's arms procurement agency, the Defense Acquisition Program Administration.""South Korea has the right to decide where to conduct maintenance for its F-35 jets, and it will decide whenever the need arises."" The plan at the moment is for the 40 F-35s to be acquired by South Korea to be serviced in Australia, an Australian defense ministry source told Reuters on condition he wasn't identified.South Korea will receive the first of the stealth planes in 2018. A source familiar with the F-35 program said South Korea could, at a later stage, negotiate with Washington on the possibility of handling the heavy maintenance of its own F-35 jets. Such a deal would require a significant investment by Seoul, including specialized equipment used to test the jets' stealth.However, barring unforeseen circumstances, the new jets would not require much heavy maintenance until five years after their delivery, said the source, who was not authorized to speak publicly. Heavy maintenance involves repairs that get into the structure of the airplanes. JAPAN NON-COMMITTAL “At the moment the regional hub in Japan will deal with the 42 Japanese F-35s, we will discuss with the Pentagon what others will be handled in Japan,” Katsuyuki Komatsu,, the Deputy Director of the Aircraft Division at Japan’s Ministry of Defense said at a briefing in Tokyo.

440,"  Houston overcomes big deficit in Armed Forces BowlFORT WORTH, Texas -- Houston did the ""impossible"" by scoring 22 points in the last 3:41 on the back of two successful onside kicks and a two-point conversion to rally past Pittsburgh 35-34 in the Lockheed Martin Armed Forces Bowl on Friday.""It was the impossible, but we did the impossible,"" Cougars interim coach David Gibbs said. ""We just started pecking away and kept after them. Every day we tell the players it's a 60-minute game.""We decided to go for two at the end because we had the momentum. Those two onside kicks were huge.""Houston quarterback Greg Ward Jr. threw all three of his touchdown passes, two to receiver Deontay Greenberry, during the improbable comeback. They connected with 59 seconds left to get Houston within a point.Gibbs took a chance in his final game before Ohio State offensive coordinator Tom Herman becomes the head coach. Instead of playing for overtime, he had Ward line up in the shotgun and roll to his right before finding Greenberry in the back of the end zone for a one-point lead.""The truth is our first bowl practice after Coach (Tony) Levine was released and I was named interim head coach, we made a decision that day at practice that if it came down to the end of the game we were going for two no matter what,"" Gibbs said. ""This is a true story. We started practicing the two-point play the very first practice, so we've probably run that play, I don't know, 25, 30 times in practice.""And the truth is, they played the right coverage and stopped the play. And they actually stopped the primary receiver, but Deontay obviously got open and Greg found him, which is a credit to those guys.""Pitt had one last chance, but All-ACC receiver Tyler Boyd dropped a pass that would have put the Panthers in field-goal range.The Cougars (8-5) were down 31-6 early in the fourth quarter and 34-13 before the wild finish. The second onside recovery, after a double change in direction by kicker Ty Cummings, gave Houston the ball back down seven with less than two minutes left. Ward completed passes of 38 and 25 yards to Greenberry on the drive, the latter going for the touchdown. Ward finished with 274 yards passing and 92 yards rushing.Ward is looking forward to working with Herman.""The future is bright,"" Ward said. ""He had three great quarterbacks at Ohio State and they all did a terrific job. For these guys to come back with me, it will be great. We're going to come back and have a better season.""Running back Kenneth Farrow scored twice and rushed for 103 yards on 22 attempts. Greenberry caught four passes for 85 yards, all in the fourth quarter. The 25-point comeback was the third largest in any bowl game ever and the largest in an FBS game this season.The 12th Armed Forces Bowl was the first featuring two interim coaches in Pitt's Joe Rudolph and Gibbs. New Pitt coach and former Michigan State defensive coordinator Pat Narduzzi made the short trip over from Thursday's Goodyear Cotton Bowl to get a firsthand look at the Panthers.""We were told he would be here, but we were going out there like any other game trying to do the very best we could,"" sophomore quarterback Chad Voytik said. ""I wouldn't say that we were playing to try and impress him or anything like that, but we knew he was here.""The Panthers (6-7) lose just 11 seniors and return 17 starters next season.""I'm excited about what they are,"" Narduzzi said. ""Tough football team, which is what I thought. It looks like a (former Pitt coach/new Wisconsin coach) Paul Chryst-type of offense."" One of Pitt's losses is All-American running back James Conner, who rushed for 90 yards and two touchdowns in his final collegiate game.

""And, obviously, this isn't the side of it you want to be on. We need to make a play there in the end.""Pitt went into halftime leading 17-6, with all the scoring coming in the second quarter. The Panthers had two long touchdown drives plus kicker Chris Blewitt's career-long 52-yard field goal as time expired.The Panthers scored first by grinding out a 92-yard touchdown drive in more than seven minutes that ended early in the second quarter. Ten of the 15 plays were runs, including Conner powering in from the 1-yard line.Houston answered with its own clock-chewing drive. Farrow capped the 73-yard march with a 2-yard run with 5:40 left until halftime. The extra point attempt was missed after kicker Kyle Bullard slipped.Voytik completed three passes for 40 yards on the ensuing drive as the Panthers went up 14-6.

444,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The U.S. Air Force said on Tuesday it was close to certifying a second company to launch military and intelligence satellites into space, and announced a review of the process used to vet new entrants.Currently, the United Launch Alliance, a joint venture of Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing Co, is the only company certified to launch large military and intelligence satellites.Lieutenant General Samuel Greaves, commander of the Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center, said in a statement late on Tuesday that the Air Force had missed a December deadline for certification, but added that ""a new entrant is close."" Greaves did not name the company, but the Air Force's top military acquisition official said last year she was optimistic  privately held Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX, would be certified to carry out launches. The Air Force previously said it hoped to complete  certification in December so SpaceX could be eligible to compete for the launch of a National Reconnaissance Office satellite, a contract that was due to be awarded by Dec. 31.No announcement has been made on which company will launch that satellite and Air Force spokeswoman Ann Stefanek declined comment on when it will be made.  The Air Force also said it planned to reexamine its certification process, developed in response to major failures and which has resulted in 79 successful launches with no failures since 1999.Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James said the service was committed to reintroducing competition into the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle program, and seek ways to streamline  the process. ""I am directing a review of our new entrant certification process by an independent team to capture the lessons learned so we can enhance competition for launch services,"" James added.SpaceX had no immediate comment on the statement.

Air Force Chief of Staff General Mark Welsh told a separate news conference at the Pentagon that he was confident the Air Force would meet its target date of declaring the F-35 A-model ready for initial combat use by August to December 2016.He said the Air Force had found a way to maintain its initial detachment of operational F-35s despite a shortage of technicians caused by lawmakers' refusal to allow the Air Force to retire its A-10 attack planes. Mabus said the Navy still expected to declare the F-35 C-model, which is designed for use on aircraft carriers, ready for combat use by the end of the decade, as planned. The Navy tested the F-35C on board a ship for the first time in November.""We’re not lukewarm about the F-35 in terms of the need for it in the fleet, and the fact that it’s going to form the backbone of our carrier air for a long time,"" he said. Mabus said the Navy was also assessing whether it needed more EA-18G Growler electronic attack planes built by Boeing Co, since it was now the only military service providing that capability.He declined to discuss the Pentagon's fiscal 2016 budget request, which will be delivered to Congress on Feb. 2, but his comment suggested the Navy could include additional Growlers in its budget request, or add them to an ""unfunded priority"" list sent separately to U.S. lawmakers for budget deliberations. The Navy's fiscal 2015 base budget request did not include any Growlers, but it added 22 of the jets to its unfunded list.

448,"  WASHINGTON Jan 15 The U.S. Navy plans to award contracts before the end of the first quarter to Lockheed Martin Corp and Australia's Austal for its next three Littoral Combat Ships as well as money to buy materials for a fourth, Navy officials said Thursday.Navy acquisition chief Sean Stackley told reporters the Navy was in talks with both companies and expected to award contracts before the pricing in the current proposals expired at the end of March.Rear Admiral Brian Antonio, program executive officer for the LCS ships, said one of the companies would be awarded a contract for two ships while the other would receive funds for one plus money to start buying material and components for a second.Both men spoke with reporters after speeches at the annual conference of the Surface Navy Association. The Navy had hoped to award contracts for two ships to each company but Congress cut funding for one of the ships given a reassessment of the vessels' capabilities completed late last year. Antonio said adding the advanced procurement funding would help the company that received only one ship order this year to avoid any associated breaks in production.Stackley said the Navy was finalizing its plans to upgrade the next 20 LCS ships, which will be redesignated as frigates, beginning in fiscal 2019. He said the Navy also planned to retrofit many of the first 32 ships in the LCS class with the planned improvements but said details had not been worked out. He said the goal was to at least add survivability upgrades to all the LCS ships.Antonio said the Navy favored competition and had not decided whether to proceed with one or both of the LCS designs when it moved ahead with the modified LCS ship, or frigate. He said a decision likely be made around 2018.

450,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Jan 14 U.S. Air Force Secretary Deborah James on Wednesday mapped out a series of initiatives aimed at lowering the cost of key weapons systems and getting them fielded sooner, saying that leaner budgets and growing threats made action imperative.""We have to stop spending more and more to get less and less,"" James told an event hosted by the Atlantic Council, a nonprofit Washington think tank. ""We are simply too slow in all that we do.""James said the initiatives are part of a broader push by the Air Force to be more flexible, adaptable and responsive.The changes grew out of a series of dialogues James has held with top industry executives and outside experts since taking office about one year ago. Ellen Lord, president and CEO of Textron Systems, a unit of Textron Inc, introduced James at the event and lauded the increased dialogue with the military service.Lockheed Martin Corp, Boeing Co, and other Air Force suppliers are watching closely to see how the Air Force and Pentagon may change or streamline weapons development and purchases. Industry executives have long argued that complex rules add cost and slow work on weapons programs. The Pentagon and the military services have focused heavily on improving acquisition processes in recent years as budget cuts have reduced funding available for new weapons programs. Congress is also pressing for reforms in the way the military buys weapons after years of cost overruns and schedule delays.James said the Air Force initiatives included a drive to speed up contract awards in cases where there is only one bidder, a process that can take up to 17 months now. She said the Air Force was also developing a process to examine the tradeoffs between cost and capabilities when starting new weapons programs, and would apply it to four new weapons competitions in coming years, including a high-profile program to build a new training aircraft.The Air Force hoped to award a contract within weeks for a new, distributed common ground system used for intelligence gathering.The Air Force is offering a $2 million prize to the company that comes up with the best proposal for a new mid-sized turbine engine, she told the event.

""Classified F-35 information is protected and remains secure,"" the program office said in a statement released Tuesday. It said all potential cyber-attacks were taken seriously and the 2010 incident was not expected to cause any negative impact to the program.In a statement, the Pentagon's F-35 program office said it remained ""ever vigilant"" about potential cyber attacks. It said the Pentagon was taking specific measures to counter evolving cyber threats against all fielded weapons systems, including the F-35. The program office said the warplane's ability to survive cyber attacks was ""foundational to the program's development, remains robustly resourced, and will continue to be a priority for the department.""China on Monday dismissed allegations that it had stolen F-35 stealth fighter plans, radar designs and engine schematics after the German magazine published documents leaked by Snowden, a former contractor with the U.S. National Security Agency.

452,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Jan 20 Northrop Grumman Corp , one of the biggest U.S. weapons makers, said on Tuesday it hired Brett Lambert, a former top U.S. defense official and expert on mergers and acquisitions, to oversee corporate strategy.Lambert's hiring, effective Jan. 26, reflects growing pressure on Northrop to boost revenues and could help the company the navigate a future merger, said defense consultant Loren Thompson, chief operating officer of the Virginia-based Lexington Institute.Analysts say consolidation in the sector is long overdue.Lambert will spearhead Northrop Grumman's corporate and business strategies. At the Pentagon, he initiate a drive to better understand the defense industrial base and represented the Pentagon on the interagency Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which evaluates proposed acquisitions by foreign companies. Lambert has worked as a consultant since leaving the Pentagon in August 2013.""If Northrop wants to keep growing, it will need to change its strategy,"" Thompson said, adding that Lambert's expertise in domestic and international mergers could be important to Northrop's future. Among major U.S. weapons makers, Northrop is the least exposed to commercial markets and foreign sales, he said, and its three major divisions all face pressures.Thompson said high stock prices have delayed a widely expected consolidation in the U.S. defense sector, but trends on demand indicate the need for fewer top defense companies in coming years. Northrop has lost several key U.S. weapons contracts over the past year, including one worth up to $1 billion to build and design the next-generation air defense for the U.S. Air Force. It was awarded to Raytheon Co.The Government Accountability Office is due to issue a ruling by Jan. 29 on a protest filed by Northrop over the contract award, and a separate protest filed by the other losing bidder in the competition, Lockheed Martin Corp.Northrop suffered another setback last month, when the U.S. Navy decided to use the V-22 tiltrotor aircraft built by Boeing Co and Textron Inc's Bell Helicopter unit instead of upgrading Northrop's older C-2A turboprop aircraft.The company is still in a high-stakes competition against a joint Boeing-Lockheed team for a huge contract to design and build the next bomber for the U.S. Air Force.

It was not immediately clear if the Navy would submit such a request to Congress this year, but Boeing is expected to kick off a major lobbying effort to press for more orders, said Jim McAleese, a Virginia-based defense consultant.Boeing Chief Executive Jim McNerney said during an earnings call last week that he expected continued demand for the F/A-18 and EA-18G planes, which are based on the same airframe. ""We've regained momentum on F-18s,"" he said, citing a ""good chance"" that production could continue to the end of the decade.Boeing spokeswoman Caroline Hutcheson said the company would keep pressing for continued production given its confidence that both models offered important capabilities to the U.S. military. One defense official said it was not certain if the services would be allowed to submit unfunded ""wish lists"" to Congress this year, given that the administration is already asking for more funding than permitted under congressional budget caps.A second official said the services would likely give lawmakers some form of the unfunded priorities lists, but it was unclear if they would be broad or more limited as they were during the tenure of former Defense Secretary Robert Gates.The Navy's budget plan also funds 29 MHR-60R helicopters in fiscal 2016, the final year of a multi-year procurement deal with United Technologies Corp's Sikorsky Aircraft unit and Lockheed, which is a joint contract with the U.S. Army.Last year, the Navy zeroed out funding for the helicopters to reflect the lack of money for the overhaul of an aircraft carrier that would carry them.

One defense official said it was not certain if the services would be allowed to submit unfunded ""wish lists"" to Congress this year, given that the administration is already asking for more funding than permitted under congressional budget caps.Officials have told lawmakers they would have to cut back many programs, including the F-35 fighter jet, if the budget caps known as sequestration, resumed in fiscal 2016.

474,"  (Adds Syring quotes, background on redesign effort, interceptor program paragraphs 3-8, 12)By Andrea ShalalWASHINGTON Feb 2 The U.S. Missile Defense Agency on Monday said it was close to finalizing a government-led effort to redesign a Raytheon Co ""kill vehicle"" used in the ground-based missile defense system that would involve Raytheon, Boeing Co and Lockheed Martin Corp.Vice Admiral James Syring, who heads the agency, said the government would own the new design, which it would use as the basis for a competition to produce the new vehicles in 2018.The government decided to spearhead the redesign effort instead of hiring a prime contractor so it could benefit from the positive aspects of each of the proposals submitted by the three rival companies, Syring told reporters at a budget briefing. ""It's our desire to get the best of all three, and that's what we intend to do,"" Syring said.The redesign effort is part of a broader effort led by Syring to improve the reliability of the existing fleet of ground-based interceptors after a series of test failures, quality problems and other issues in recent years.The agency conducted a successful intercept test in June for the first time since 2008. A non-intercept test was planned this year to evaluate alternative ""divert thruster"" to steer the interceptor, with the next intercept test slated a year later. Boeing runs the Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) system for the government, but the Missile Defense Agency will take over the effort to develop a new more reliable kill vehicle or warhead once its plan is approved. Syring said the Pentagon was ""very close"" to approving the plan.The agency requested $279 million as part of its overall $8.1 billion budget to continue design work on a new kill vehicle to improve reliability, availability and performance, and ensure the warheads were more producible. The agency's 2016 budget request also includes funding for a detailed look at the reliability and design characteristics of the current fleet of interceptors.Syring said the agency also planned to award a contract for development of a new long-range discriminating radar before the end of fiscal 2015. Bids are due in March, with Raytheon, Lockheed and Northrop Grumman Corp  expected to bid.Syring said there was ""absolutely no presumed winner"" in that competition, which will result in a contract valued at nearly $1 billion.The Air Force initially chose Raytheon to develop a separate long-range radar but is now reevaluating bids received from all three firms after Lockheed and Northrop protested the initial decision.

Poland plans to spend an estimated total of 130 billion zlotys ($36 billion) between 2013 and 2022 on modernising its armed forces.Last year, Poland excluded the Lockheed Martin-led consortium from the tender, short-listing two contenders: a consortium of European group MBDA and France's Thales SA , and U.S. firm Raytheon Co, as potential suppliers.This decision may now be reviewed, the source said, if Germany decides to implement MEADS. The Polish defence ministry, MEADS and Raytheon did not immediately reply to requests for comment. MBDA declined to comment.

""We will consider allowing the MEADS system to take part in the tender, if Germany decides that it will be at the core of their missile defence.""""Formally, MEADS' participation in the Polish tender is still possible,"" the source added.Lockheed had no immediate comment on the news. Raytheon spokeswoman Kristin Hilf said the company had no indication that Poland had plans to change its approach since the June 2014 decision to short-list two bidders.Berlin is deciding whether to modernise its missile defences, based on Raytheon's Patriot system, or implement MEADS. A German decision to commit to Lockheed Martin's system would help the consortium meet Poland's requirement that all proposed solutions have to be operational and in use by another NATO member state's armed forces.""Poland wants its missile defence systems to be compatible with German ones, because Germany is our closest ally,"" the source said.Last year, a senior German government source told Reuters the decision could come in 2015, once technical and legal questions have been clarified.According to a document seen by Reuters, the decision could be made this summer, but the Polish Ministry of Defence source said Poland thought Berlin could reach a decision as soon as Feb. 15.The United States, Italy and Germany spent about $3.4 billion over the past decade to develop MEADS as a successor to Patriot, but the United States decided in 2012 to withdraw due to budget cuts.

478,"   By Alwyn Scott | NEW YORK  NEW YORK New rules on privately owned drones can't come fast enough for most Americans.Some 73 percent of respondents to a Reuters/Ipsos online poll released on Thursday said they want regulations for the lightweight, remote-control planes that reportedly have been involved in an increasing number of close calls with aircraft and crowds. People are also uneasy about potential invasions of privacy by drones carrying cameras or other devices.Forty-two percent went as far as to oppose private ownership of drones, suggesting they prefer restricting them to officials or experts trained in safe operation.Another 30 percent said private drone ownership was fine, and 28 percent were not sure, according to the survey of more than 2,000 respondents, conducted Jan. 21-27.Many respondents were surveyed before a small quad copter breeched the White House security perimeter and crash-landed on the grounds on Jan. 26.The poll results show widespread unease about the devices, many of which can fly as high as 6,000 feet carrying video cameras or other payloads.""In regular peoples' hands, it's easy for them to get misused,"" said poll respondent Sandy Gifford, a 58-year-old daycare worker in Portland, Oregon. She equated drone dangers with those posed by guns and drugs.     The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration is months late in developing small drone regulations. A draft FAA rule, under review by the White House Office of Management and Budget, is expected to be published soon, kicking off a year or two of comment and revisions before it takes effect.The FAA rule will cover commercial drone uses, such as photography, surveying and crop inspection, which are now mostly banned. It will not apply to hobbyists operating model aircraft under a safety code of a community-based organization. Congress granted these users an exemption from rules in 2012.It was unclear how the rule will deal with people who buy drones online or at a big box store, rather than joining the sport through a club or hobby shop.These non-traditional users, ""don't have the same safety mindset that a modeler does,"" said Rich Hanson, government affairs director at the Academy of Model Aeronautics, world's largest community-based model aircraft group, with nearly 80 years of safe flying. The AMA safety code says devices should stay below 400 feet near airports, not be flown carelessly or recklessly, and avoid all other aircraft, among other things.Drones also have sparked fears of snooping by neighbors or law enforcement. The Reuters/Ipsos poll showed strong attitudes on both questions. Seventy-one percent said drones should not be allowed to operate over someone else's property, and 64 percent said they would not want their neighbor to have a drone.But respondents widely supported drone use in law enforcement. Sixty-eight percent of respondents support police flying drones to solve crimes, and 62 percent support using them to deter crime.""Where there's suspicious activity, it would help the police,"" said Phillip Gimino, 75, a retired engineer in Edmond, Oklahoma, who flew gas-powered radio-controlled aircraft as a kid. ""But it should be limited.""  Gimino, a former gun dealer, opposes gun control laws, but said drones should be off limits to private owners until rules are in place.The survey showed a split on other uses: 46 percent don't want news organizations using drones to gather news, while 41 percent support that use. And 49 percent think parents should be able to use drones to monitor their children, while 38 percent oppose that use.The survey of 2,405 American adults has a credibility interval of plus or minus 2.3 percentage points.(Corrects spelling of Hanson in 11th paragraph.)

The new system will be used to train pilots for the next 50 years. About two years ago, as the Air Force began to refine its requirements for the new plane, the companies decided it made more sense to start from scratch with a new design.

Other companies on the team include L-3 Communications Holdings  and German robotics giant Kuka AG.Another key player is Scaled Composites, a Northrop unit that builds experimental aircraft like the X-47B, a drone that Northrop successfully tested on an aircraft carrier. General Electric built the engine for the prototype. The competition will be fierce: Boeing, Lockheed, Textron Inc, and a joint venture of General Dynamics and Italy's Finmeccanica Spa, all plan to submit bids when the tender kicks off in 2017.Marc Lindsley, director and head of Northrop's T-X ""capture team,"" declined to give any details about the new airplane or its attributes. He said all the companies on the team were investing heavily in the project, which will include ground-based training equipment, advanced simulators and an open architecture design to facilitate continual upgrades. Lindsley said the companies first told the Air Force about the change in their plans several months ago.He said a ""clean sheet"" design would allow the team to take advantage of new technologies and advanced manufacturing techniques, such as 3-D printing, which would help keep down the cost of the new planes.""We want to give the Air Force what they want,"" he said.

Pratt said it has cut the cost of the F135 engine by 55 percent since its first delivery.The U.S. government signs separate production agreements with Lockheed Martin Corp, which builds the plane, and Pratt, which builds the engine. The Pentagon plans to spend nearly $400 billion to develop and build 2,457 of the radar-evading warplanes over the next two decades. Croswell welcomed the start of a long-delayed increase in production of the F-35 in the fiscal 2016 budget, which funds 57 jets after 38 a year earlier, and said it would help Pratt, Lockheed and other key suppliers drive down the plane's cost.Pratt and Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc, which makes the lift fan for the F-35 B-model, are finalizing plans for further reducing the engine's cost, Croswell said. He gave no details. Lockheed and the other key suppliers for the airframe - Northrop Grumman Corp and BAE Systems Plc  -launched a similar effort last summer, which maps out specific investments to reduce the cost to build and repair the planes.Croswell said Pratt had also developed plans to upgrade the F135 engine in two separate phases.If the Pentagon accepts and funds the plans, the first upgrades would begin in 2017 or 2018 and reduce the fuel burn of the engine by 5 to 7 percent, Croswell said. The next upgrades would begin around 2022, cutting fuel burn by a further 15 to 20 percent.The upgrades draw on research work funded by the Air Force and the Navy in recent years.

Flight testing with the 2B software which runs the jet and its weapons systems had revealed ""some areas that we have to clean up a little bit"" to improve integration of radar tracking data, Carvalho said.The F-35 program has been dogged with software issues, although most of the problems have been worked out and company and government officials say the program's development - including software - is on budget and schedule. ""I still feel very confident that we're going to get there,"" Carvalho said, when asked if the software issues could delay the Marine Corps July target date. Carvalho spoke with Reuters during the company's annual media day. He said the company was working closely with the F-35 program office and the Marine Corps to determine whether the issues needed to be addressed with a separate software update. A decision was expected in coming weeks, he said.Lorraine Martin, Lockheed's F-35 program manager, said she was confident that the F-35 program was moving along well on multiple fronts to prepare for the Marine Corps target date, including software development, flight testing, training and even preparation of threat scenarios for pilots.Carvalho stressed that software testing was designed to flush out areas for improvement, and he did not view the new software challenge as a critical showstopper for the program.

""And a lot of them had less stringent requirements in terms of the quality of the graphene and hole sizes.""

507,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON United Launch Alliance, a joint venture of the top two U.S. arms makers, on Friday said it will slash costs and hunt out new customers to ensure continued growth despite the rise of a new rival, privately-held Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX.Tory Bruno, who took over as chief executive of the 50-50 venture of Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing Co in August, told Reuters he was confident the company would survive increased competition and even prosper in the coming age of heightened activity and exploitation of space.""We're not the least bit afraid of competition,"" he said in a telephone interview. ""It's not a huge marketplace, but I'm happy to get in there to compete and fight for business.""ULA was formed in 2006 when Lockheed and Boeing realized there was not enough commercial demand to support two separate firms making the costly rockets used to launch heavy military and intelligence satellites into space.Overriding concerns voiced at the time by the Federal Trade Commission, the Pentagon backed the creation of ULA as a monopoly launch provider to ensure continued production of two different rockets -  Boeing's Delta 4, and Lockheed's Atlas 5 - that were powerful enough to hoist huge government satellites. Nearly a decade later, SpaceX is on the verge of being certified to launch at least some of those spacecraft, which will cut into ULA's prospective orders at a time when future military launches are also set to taper off until the 2020s.Further complicating matters, Congress - worried about escalating tensions with Moscow - has capped the use of the Russian-built engines used to power one of ULA's rockets, the Atlas 5, from 2019.The changing landscape has raised questions about the future of the venture, and whether it can generate enough revenues and profits to keep both Lockheed and Boeing happy. ""Like any business, when the environment changes, you have to change with it in order to stay relevant,"" Bruno said, noting that he planned to transform the company by halving the cost and cycle time of current launches.ULA has already added NASA as a customer, and is now courting firms in the telecommunications sector. It will also invest over $100 million to cut the number of launch pads from five to two, one on each coast, with each able to launch ULA's two current rockets and a new one due to begin testing in 2019.Bruno said ULA would unveil details of its ""next-generation launch system"" in April, which includes a new engine being developed by Blue Origin, a venture run by Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos. ULA also plans a new a la carte pricing model to make it easier for commercial and government customers to develop launch plans, Bruno said.Top Lockheed executives this week said they were keeping a close eye on the evolving rocket launch market, but ULA's future looked positive for now, given its contract to complete 36 rocket launches for the U.S. Air Force in coming years.""Right now, it's a strong, successful joint venture and we're fully behind it,"" said Chief Executive Marillyn Hewson.

509,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Feb 24 Lockheed Martin Corp's  F-35 Joint Strike Fighter will start ""ski-jump testing"" at a Maryland air base this week, while another B-model jet wraps up six months of tests at temperatures as low as minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 40 Celsius) to as high as 120 F (49 C).Two UK pilots will test the ability of the new warplane to take off from upward-sloping ski-jump ramps used on aircraft carriers like those operated by Britain and Italy. The ramps launch the jets forward and upward, reducing the thrust needed.Sylvia Pierson, spokeswoman for the Pentagon's F-35 program office, said two British pilots, one from BAE Systems Plc  and the other from the British Royal Navy, would use the first UK F-35B jet to complete the testing through late May.The F-35 is also finishing six months of tests at the McKinley Climatic Laboratory in Florida, another key milestone before the U.S. Marine Corps declares the jet ready for initial combat use in July. After 14 years of development, early cost overruns and schedule delays, the $400 billion F-35 fighter jet program is becoming an operational reality for the U.S. military. Over 120 jets are flying at nine U.S. bases.Richard Aboulafia, analyst with the Teal Group, said the program has stabilized but it is unclear whether the Air Force will stick to plans to buy 1,763 F-35 A-models through 2037 even as it ramps up work on a new bomber and a ""sixth generation"" jet.The F-35 climate testing has been closely watched by the U.S. military and nine other countries that have placed orders: Britain, Italy, Turkey, Australia, Norway, Japan, South Korea, the Netherlands and Israel. Pilots, technicians and F-35 program officials have tested the jet's performance in heat, driving rain, hurricane-force winds, snow, sleet and other extreme conditions.Industry and government officials say the testing has gone better than expected, although final assessments will wait until after the testing is concluded next month. Billie Flynn, a former Canadian Air Force pilot who tested the F-16 fighter 23 years ago in the same climate chamber, said he expected the F-35 to face some issues since it is so much more complex and software-driven.But Flynn, now a Lockheed F-35 test pilot, said the jet surpassed his expectations. ""This just gives us so much more confidence about when and where we operate the jets.""F-35 program officials and enginemaker Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp, said oil in the engine became too thick at very cold temperatures, but the problem had been resolved by switching to a thinner oil used by the Air Force.They said it was unclear if the issue would require a minor modification to an external component of the engine.

513,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Lockheed Martin Corp, the Pentagon's No. 1 supplier, said it has seen a ""sea change"" in demand for cyber security services in critical infrastructure areas such as energy, oil and gas, and financial institutions over the past 18 months.Increased media coverage, more sharing of data about cyber attacks, tighter government regulations, and growing concerns about the fiduciary duties of corporate boards and chief executives have stoked that demand over the past 18 months, said Chandra McMahon, vice president of commercial markets for Lockheed's Information Systems security services.McMahon told Reuters in a telephone interview that Lockheed's commercial cyber division had doubled its clients over the past year alone, and the company expected to generate double digit growth over the next five years. ""This is a marathon. We're in this for the long term,"" she said on Friday. She welcomed the increased engagement of corporate boards and C-suites, but said it was critical to remain vigilant and also to hire more skilled cyber experts. She said part of her group's growth was due to Lockheed's acquisition in March 2014 of Industrial Defender, a leading provider of security solutions for control systems in the oil and gas, utility and chemical industries.Lockheed is one of few U.S. weapons makers that is reporting success in its efforts to break into the commercial cyber security market. Boeing Co recently exited that part of the business, and General Dynamics Corp is focused more on security for government agencies, not commercial firms.""We've seen a shift in boards directing independent cyber assessments, especially in the critical infrastructure areas,"" McMahon said, adding that corporate directors and chief executives were taking a deeper look at their own security arrangements given the growing number of high-profile breaches. She said that trend gathered steam last December after a cyber-related breach at a Turkish gas pipeline, and news that a 2008 incident at a German steel mill had been linked to a cyber attack rather than an equipment malfunction as initial reported.McMahon said no such destructive attacks had been seen at U.S. infrastructure facilities, but adversaries were expanding their reconnaissance activities aimed at U.S. companies and also staging malicious software for future attacks. She said the growing concerns had prompted some clients to adopt the Industrial Defender security system for industrial controls across an entire enterprise.

514,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON, March 2  WASHINGTON, March 2 Lockheed Martin Corp , the Pentagon's No. 1 supplier, said it has seen a ""sea change"" in demand for cybersecurity services in critical infrastructure areas such as energy, oil and gas, and financial institutions over the past 18 months.Increased media coverage, more sharing of data about cyber attacks, tighter government regulations, and growing concerns about the fiduciary duties of corporate boards and chief executives have stoked that demand over the past 18 months, said Chandra McMahon, vice president of commercial markets for Lockheed's Information Systems security services.McMahon told Reuters in a telephone interview that Lockheed's commercial cyber division had doubled its clients over the past year alone, and the company expected to generate double digit growth over the next five years.""This is a marathon. We're in this for the long term,"" she said on Friday. She welcomed the increased engagement of corporate boards and C-suites, but said it was critical to remain vigilant and also to hire more skilled cyber experts. She said part of her group's growth was due to Lockheed's acquisition in March 2014 of Industrial Defender, a leading provider of security solutions for control systems in the oil and gas, utility and chemical industries.Lockheed is one of few U.S. weapons makers that is reporting success in its efforts to break into the commercial cyber security market. Boeing Co recently exited that part of the business, and General Dynamics Corp is focused more on security for government agencies, not commercial firms. ""We've seen a shift in boards directing independent cyber assessments, especially in the critical infrastructure areas,"" McMahon said, adding that corporate directors and chief executives were taking a deeper look at their own security arrangements given the growing number of high-profile breaches.She said that trend gathered steam last December after a cyber-related breach at a Turkish gas pipeline, and news that a 2008 incident at a German steel mill had been linked to a cyber attack rather than an equipment malfunction as initial reported. McMahon said no such destructive attacks had been seen at U.S. infrastructure facilities, but adversaries were expanding their reconnaissance activities aimed at U.S. companies and also staging malicious software for future attacks.She said the growing concerns had prompted some clients to adopt the Industrial Defender security system for industrial controls across an entire enterprise.Lockheed was also picking up commercial business overseas, she said, although she gave no details.

The sources asked not to be identified because the sale process is not public. Representatives for Novetta, Arlington Capital Partners, Morgan Stanley and Houlihan Lokey declined to comment.McLean, Virginia-based Novetta offers data analytics services to government clients working with large sets of data. Its customers include national intelligence agencies, the U.S. Department of Defense and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Technology companies Hewlett-Packard Co and IBM Corp , as well as defense contractors such as Lockheed Martin Corp, Raytheon Co and General Dynamics Corp , could show interest in Novetta, according to the sources.Representatives from General Dynamics, Hewlett-Packard, Lockheed Martin, and IBM declined to comment. Raytheon did not respond to a request for comment. A deal for Novetta would be just the latest example of a private equity firm selling a government services portfolio company.Last month, government services contractor Engility Holdings Inc, acquired TASC, a provider of professional services to government agencies for $1.3 billion. TASC was controlled by affiliates of the private equity firms KKR & Co LP and General Atlantic LLC.On Sunday, Science Applications International Corp  a provider of information technology and engineering services to governments, said it would acquire Scitor Corp, a smaller peer, for $790 million.

518,"   By David Brunnstrom and Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON, March 4  WASHINGTON, March 4 The U.S. military is considering sending its THAAD missile defense system to the Middle East, a senior U.S. Army general said on Wednesday, citing what he called an urgent need to respond to foes with missile systems and the will to use them.General Vincent Brooks, head of U.S. Army Pacific Command, said no decisions had been made about deploying a U.S.-owned Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) battery in the Middle East or South Korea, another region where he saw an urgent need given the threat posed by North Korea.""The need is there in ... those two places, urgently, because we have adversaries who have capability and they have demonstrated that they are willing to use it,"" Brooks told Reuters in an interview.Brooks did not name Iran, but U.S. military officials have raised concerns in the past about Iran's development of longer-range missiles that could reach Israel and potentially Europe.The U.S. military must weigh its options, given the high cost involved in deploying the THAAD weapon system, built by Lockheed Martin Corp, Brooks said. He said the U.S. military also continued to explore options for lower-cost systems to defend against lesser threats, but gave no details. The Army is preparing to swap out a THAAD battery that has been operating in Guam for about a year. It has four active THAAD batteries, with a fifth to start training this year.""They have to decide where the need is greatest,"" said one congressional aide said. ""The question is, what does the Central Command commander need to protect U.S. forces.""The commander of U.S. troops stationed in South Korea last June said he had proposed deploying THAAD missiles to South Korea to counter the growing threat of nuclear-armed North Korea's weapons capabilities. Critics say such a deployment could inflame tensions with China and Russia as they see the move as a threat to their security interests.U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in Seoul last month that a THAAD deployment in South Korea was not under active discussion.Lockheed will make initial deliveries of a THAAD system bought by the United Arab Emirates under a $1.96 billion sale first announced in December 2011, but it will take a year or more until the system is fully operational. Lockheed hopes to finalize a similar deal with Qatar over the next two years, and Saudi Arabia is also considering a possible purchase.Brooks said the U.S. military remained in dialogue with various Asian countries about how they could take responsibility for self-defense, and how any capabilities could be networked together to help defend allies elsewhere in the region.Sources familiar with the THAAD system said they did not believe a deployment to the Middle East was imminent.Riki Ellison, founder of the nonprofit Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance, said putting a THAAD system in the Middle East would help cover potential gaps in the existing coverage of the area such as provided by the Aegis system on U.S. destroyers and Patriot missile batteries.Ultimately, he said, a decision to station a THAAD system in the Middle East would be a ""political chess move"" in the current U.S. talks with Iran over ending its nuclear weapons program.

519,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) is in talks with the U.S. Air Force about cutting the cost of future missile warning satellites by up to 25 percent, and it could lower the tab on the next batch of Global Positioning System III (GPS-III) satellites by 40 percent.Lockheed said on Monday that the Air Force could decide by June on a proposal to replace the current unique spacecraft planned for the fifth and sixth Space-Based Infrared System (SBIRS) satellites with an updated and cheaper version of the A2100 satellite ""bus"" used for the GPS satellites.Making the swap would allow Lockheed to lower the cost of the 7th and 8th satellites in the SBIRS system by a further 20 percent to 25 percent, Rickus Ambrose, executive vice president of Lockheed's space division, told Reuters in an interview.The company, working closely with the Air Force's Space and Missiles Systems Center, has already reduced the cost of the first six satellites in the system by nearly 40 percent to around $1.1 billion each. U.S. lawmakers and the Air Force are pressing for additional savings. Lockheed has invested heavily over the past three years to modernize the A2100 platform, adding flexible solar arrays, reducing the number of component parts and making it easier to reconfigure the satellite for different users.The company has also proposed simplifying the pair of infrared sensors currently used on the satellites. SMC Executive Director Dave Madden told reporters last week the Air Force was looking at the Lockheed proposal to use the A2100 bus for the fifth and sixth satellites, as well as a new wide-field sensor payload on the seventh and eighth satellites. He said an analysis of alternatives was still ongoing but was likely to point in that direction.Ambrose said the savings realized on the fifth and sixth satellites would be used for integrating the new spacecraft with its payloads, but the government could save up to 25 percent on the seventh and eighth satellites, if it decides to buy them. He said Lockheed was focused on delivering the first GPS III satellite after significant delays. He said the company was due to integrate the payload with the satellite in early April and should complete environmental testing later this summer.Ambrose said Lockheed could lower the cost of the satellites by 40 percent in time for an expected competition in 2018.

520,"  (Recasts lead, adds quotes from Lockheed, F-35 program office)By Andrea ShalalWASHINGTON, March 19 The Pentagon on Thursday lowered the projected procurement cost of Lockheed Martin Corp's  F-35 fighter jet by almost two percent and officials vowed to keep trimming the cost of the largest U.S. arms program.The U.S. Defense Department's annual report on weapons programs forecast it would cost $391.1 billion to buy 2,457 F-35 jets. That represents a drop of $7.5 billion, or 1.9 percent, from last year's estimate, due to lower labor and estimated inflation rates, and a cut in the number of spares needed.The report said the net cost of 79 major U.S. arms programs dropped 0.6 percent, or $9.1 billion, to $1.6 trillion, reflecting ongoing efforts to cut costs, improve oversight and keep programs on schedule. Lockheed and the Pentagon's F-35 program office welcomed the lower cost estimate for the stealthy new warplanes and said they were continuing efforts to cut costs further.The F-35 program office said its estimate of the cost to operate and maintain the jets through 2065 fell almost $58 billion to $859 billion in 2014, below the unchanged $1.02 trillion estimate of the Pentagon's Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation office. Lockheed's F-35 program manager Lorraine Martin said the lower forecast was the result of ""a laser focus"" by the government and all companies involved on cutting costs, improving quality in manufacturing, getter parts faster and reducing design changes.""We aren't stopping here,"" Martin said in a statement. ""We have numerous initiatives in place ... that will drive program costs even lower allowing us to provide ... a fifth-generation F-35 jet at a fourth-generation price by the end of the decade."" The report put the average procurement cost of each F-35 fighter at $135.7 million, including inflation, over the life of the program. Adding in research, development and military infrastructure, the cost was $159.2 million per jet.The F-35 program office said the actual cost of jets and engines bought from Lockheed and engine maker Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp, was coming down each year and remained well below government estimates.Under the eighth set of production contracts, each  conventional takeoff A-model jet and engine cost $108 million, down from $112 million, while the cost of the B-model jet, which can take off and land like a helicopter, dropped to $134 million from $139 million, it said.The Navy version of the jet, which can land on an aircraft carrier, dropped to $129 million from $130 million, the program office said.

522,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The U.S. Navy included 12 Boeing Co F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter jets and eight Lockheed Martin Corp F-35s on a list of ""unfunded priorities"" prepared for Congress, defense officials and other sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.The Navy's list was reviewed by senior Pentagon officials and the Joint Chiefs of Staff this week, and should be sent to U.S. lawmakers in coming days, said the sources, who asked not to be named because the vetting is still under way.Top Pentagon officials are skeptical about the weapons wish lists, and worry they help lawmakers ""cherry pick"" specific weapons programs to fund, while crowding out bigger priorities. However, they say they will not stand in the way of the military services complying with requests from lawmakers.The total value of the additional 12 Boeing jets is around $1 billion, while the eight extra Lockheed jets would be just over $1 billion, the sources said. A decision by Congress to fund the extra Boeing jets as part of the Navy's fiscal 2016 budget would help the company extend its St. Louis production line beyond the end of 2017, although it was not immediately clear for how long. Company officials have said they must decide this summer whether to start shutting down the line or bet their own money to buy titanium and other supplies that take a long time to deliver, before Congress finalize the 2016 budget.There is great uncertainty about fiscal 2016 funding levels - and any programs on the ""unfunded"" list - since Congress remains deadlocked over whether to lift budget caps that would cut $35 billion from the Pentagon's base budget plan.The Navy had hoped to include the Boeing and Lockheed jets in its base budget request, but gave up that funding to protect shipbuilding programs deemed more critical. Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Jonathan Greenert told Congress the Navy faces a possible shortfall of two to three squadrons of F/A-18 strike fighters, or up to 36 aircraft, given delays in extending the life of older model F/A-18 aircraft, also called legacy Hornets.Ordering Super Hornets now would also preserve the option of ordering additional EA-18G electronic attack aircraft, or Growlers, which are built at the same facility, if needed by other military services. Representative Randy Forbes, a Virginia Republican and key member of the House Armed Services Committee, told Reuters this week that lawmakers needed the lists to better understand the tradeoffs that went into shaping the overall Pentagon budget.Boeing has said it needs to build two jets a month at the facility to maintain current pricing, which means funding for a dozen more jets would extend production through mid-2018. Analysts say the company is also chasing a possible order from Kuwait that could keep the factory running through the end of 2018.

523,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The U.S. Defense Department is taking aggressive action to bolster the security of U.S. weapons systems against cyberattacks, including issuing new rules for acquisitions that will be finalized in coming months, officials told Reuters.   In addition to the acquisition policy, the department is producing a guidebook to help program managers assess the cost and risk tradeoffs in structuring new weapons programs and making them more secure, said Assistant Secretary of Defense Katrina McFarland.Both documents should be completed in the fourth quarter of this fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30, McFarland told Reuters in an interview this week. She said officials were reviewing the  documents to avoid inadvertently pointing would-be attackers to possible vulnerabilities.Chief U.S. arms buyer Frank Kendall said this month cyberattacks on U.S. weapons and manufacturers are a ""pervasive"" problem that requires greater attention.In January, the department's chief weapons tester told Congress that nearly every U.S. arms program showed ""significant vulnerabilities"" to cyberattacks, including misconfigured, unpatched and outdated software.Increased focus on cybersecurity could create opportunities for Lockheed Martin Corp, General Dynamics Corp and other suppliers that do cybersecurity work for the Pentagon. ""The threat is very, very serious,"" Terry Halvorsen, the Pentagon's chief information officer, told Reuters. ""We are taking very aggressive action to counter those threats.""Halvorsen cited what he called constant, growing and increasingly sophisticated threats from criminals, extremist groups and foreign governments. He said cyber warfare offered attackers the possibility of doing great harm for little cost.He said the Pentagon was also evaluating the risk of so-called insiders sabotaging weapons systems and had taken some ""preemptive actions"" to guard against that. McFarland said all major U.S. weapons programs had been reviewed for cyber vulnerabilities. New programs like the Air Force long-range bomber - to be awarded this summer - would benefit from getting the best protections from the start.The new measures follow a change in federal defense acquisition rules announced last November that require Pentagon contractors to incorporate established security standards on the unclassified networks that they use to communicate with suppliers, and to report any cyberattacks that result in the loss of technical data from those networks.Those standards had already been in place for classified networks.     Halvorsen said some weapons systems and sectors were particularly targeted by hackers, but gave no details.He and McFarland declined to say if U.S. government networks or those of private companies had suffered any attacks similar to the attack that damaged some 30,000 computers at Saudi Arabia's national oil company in 2012.Admiral Mike Rogers, director of the National Security Agency and head of U.S. Cyber Command, told lawmakers this week the United States was at a tipping point and needed to step up its offensive cyber capabilities.McFarland said the guidebook would ensure that program managers and acquisition officials did a better job sharing data about potential threats to avoid falling prey to the same malicious software twice.

524,"  (Recasts with Lockheed confirmation)By Andrea ShalalWASHINGTON, March 22 Lockheed Martin Corp  said it is working to resolve a technical error disclosed by the U.S. Air Force on Sunday that affected some global positioning system (GPS) satellites but did not degrade the accuracy of GPS signals received by users around the world.Lockheed said the error involved the ground control system for GPS satellites it runs for the Air Force.Lockheed spokeswoman Christine Courard said the company had put a ""workaround"" in place to avoid further errors and was working on a full software correction with the Air Force. Air Force Space Command said the glitch appeared to involve the ground-based software used to index, or sort, some messages transmitted by GPS IIF satellites built by Boeing Co, but officials were still investigating other possible causes.Air Force spokesman Andy Roake said the issue came to light in recent days, but archived data showed the problem had gone unnoticed since 2013. He gave no details of the extent of the problem, its impact on the system or how it was discovered. The Air Force said the problem appeared related to the ground software that builds and uploads messages transmitted by GPS satellites, resulting in an occasional message failing to meet U.S. technical specifications.Boeing, prime contractor for the GPS IIF satellites, had no immediate comment on the news, which comes days before the Air Force is due to launch the ninth GPS IIF satellite into space. GPS is a space-based worldwide navigation system that provides users with highly accurate data on position, timing and velocity 24 hours a day, in all weather conditions.The U.S military uses the GPS for targeting precision munitions and steering drones. It also has a wide range of commercial applications for the financial sector, farming and tracking shipments of packages. Car navigation systems and mobile phones use GPS to determine their location.Boeing is under contract to build 12 GPS IIF satellites. The first of the GPS IIF satellites was launched in May 2010.

But the Marine Corps still planned to declare its F-35 B-model jets ready for initial combat use in July, he said.The issue was being corrected and tested, he said, but the final version of the software would not be ready until early fall, instead of June, as planned. As a result, Lockheed would likely forfeit some of the $300 million in incentive fees linked to completion of three separate software packages - 2B, 3I and 3F - for the jet, he said. ""They get none of it if they don't finish 2B, 3I and 3F with full capability, on time,"" he said, forecasting a four- to five-month delay in the final 2B software. Lockheed spokesman Michael Rein said the 2B fee was only part of the available software award fee, and the amount would be determined once the final 2B software was delivered.Bogdan said the Marine Corps was proceeding with the current version of the 2B software version, and would modify its use of the jets to account for the deficiencies. For instance, the fusion issue did not occur when two jets shared data, which meant the Marines could fly two sets of two jets, instead of combining them into a four-jet set, he said.Bogdan said the current version of the software was safe for pilots to fly and the program office could have fixed the issue as part of the 3I software effort, but was pressing ahead now to avoid future delays.He said the program was also closely monitoring work on a  computer-based logistics system, bulkhead issues with the B-model, and efforts to make the planes more reliable. He said the overall program was doing well, with costs slowing coming down and major milestones on schedule.Bogdan said some foreign countries slated to buy the F-35 jets in coming years hoped to drive down production costs even further by buying several years' worth of jets at a time, beginning with the 11th batch of jets.

He cited changing market conditions, including the rise of a rival launch company and prospects for an increase in government satellite launches.He said the contract was initially put in place to protect ""a very fragile industrial base"" in the 2000s, when there were few U.S. government satellites being launched due to program delays, and commercial demand failed to materialize as expected.He said the contract made it impossible to have a fair competition, backing an argument often made by privately held Space Exploration Technologies. The company, also called SpaceX, hopes to be certified by June to compete for some satellite launches now carried out solely by ULA. ""I don't think you can have a fair competition with that contract in place. There'll have to be a change,"" Hyten told the House Armed Services Committee's strategic forces subcommittee, noting that emergence of a new competitor changed the situation.Dyke Weatherington, acting deputy assistant defense secretary for space, strategic and intelligence systems, said some funding for launch infrastructure would likely be folded into the per-launch pricing for future contracts for launch services, instead of being awarded separately. Gwynne Shotwell, president of SpaceX, told the same subcommittee on March 17 that continuing the annual $1 billion contract to ULA would skew any future competition, and the Air Force would have to adjust its cost estimates to reflect the infrastructure support given to ULA.The Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, last year said the separate launch capability contract made it difficult for the Pentagon to determine an accurate price for an individual launch by ULA. ULA President Tory Bruno last week said the company was developing a more transparent pricing model for future launches.The U.S. Air Force said on Monday it was on track to certify SpaceX to launch U.S. military and spy satellites by June, with the final efforts focused on qualifying the second stage engine and structure of its Falcon 9 rocket.

Carter told lawmakers he was sending the lists of ""unfunded priorities"" to Congress as required under a defense policy law of fiscal 2013, but registered his concerns about any moves by Congress to restructure the Pentagon's budget request. The biggest items on the annual lists this year included a dozen Boeing fighter jets requested by the Navy to cover projected shortfall in strike fighters in coming years at a projected cost of $1.15 billion. If approved by Congress, the orders could help Boeing extend production at its St. Louis manufacturing plant, which is currently slated to end in 2017.The Navy also requested eight more F-35C fighter jets for use on its carriers for $1.04 billion, while the Marine Corps asked for six more F-35 B-model jets, which take off and land like helicopters, at a cost of $1.05 billion. The Navy also asked for $65 million to buy an additional Triton unmanned surveillance plane built by Northrop Grumman Corp.The Army asked for $200 million for PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement missiles built by Lockheed to keep up with surging demand for missile defense by military commanders, and $975 million to beef up cybersecurity at key sites in the United States, Europe and South Korea.

PAC-3 missiles will be bought from the United States.South Korea has been trying to bolster its arsenal in the face of a missile threat from North Korea.""Once the Patriot upgrades are completed, the warheads of North Korean ballistic missiles can be struck directly, and minimising damage to the ground,"" DAPA said in a statement. Reclusive North Korea sporadically test fires missiles on the Korean peninsula, most recently in protest against annual U.S.-South Korean military exercises.The KF-X mid-level fighter jet programme will aim to develop jets to replace ageing F-4 and F-5 fighters by 2025, as well as adding air defence for its sole foreign partner, Indonesia, which is paying a fifth of the development cost.KAI beat out Korean Air Lines, which had partnered with Airbus. The PAC-3 missiles will be built by Lockheed Martin. The total upgrade is expected to cost about 1.3 trillion won ($1.18 billion), two people with knowledge of the matter said.Both declined to be identified because the details of the projects are confidential.With South Korea's arms procurement budget increasingly constrained, some analysts have questioned the viability of the fighter jet project. A state-run South Korean think tank estimated the KF-X programme would need an additional 10 trillion won for production.Indonesia agreed last year to pay 20 percent of the development costs. DAPA's estimated budget requirement for arms procurement in 2016-2020 was 96 trillion won, up from 72 trillion won DAPA estimated for 2015-2019, Yonhap reported this month.The budget has already been hit by high-profile purchases such as the 40 Lockheed Martin F-35 fighter jets for 7.34 trillion won finalised last year, and four in-flight refuelling tankers for about 1.4 trillion won under negotiation.DAPA declined to comment on the cost of the projects, or on Lockheed's involvement.Lockheed Martin said it was committed to supporting the KF-X programme but did not have any immediate comment on the Patriot upgrade.

Rocket Lab, a privately-held company financed by weapons maker Lockheed Martin Corp and other high-tech investors, on Tuesday said its low-cost Electron launch system for small satellites will be the first rocket powered by batteries.Chief Executive Peter Beck said the company founded in 2008 to help commercialize the space business, expected to carry out the first flight of its all-composite Electron launch vehicle and the new Rutherford engine before the end of the year.Beck said the engine was also the first to use 3D printing for all primary components, including its engine chamber, injector, pumps and main propellant valves, all mostly made of titanium and other alloys.The lightweight engine can be ""printed"" in three days, compared to about a month if it were built using traditional manufacturing. Rocket Lab, which is based in Los Angeles and has a launch site in New Zealand, says the two-stage Electron rocket will make it cheaper and quicker to launch small 100-kilogram payloads into low-earth orbit.The company expects to start launching satellites for customers in 2016, and eventually aims to launch a satellite a week. It says its launch cost will be less than $5 million, half the price that Virgin Galactic is charging for rides on its air-launched satellite booster, LauncherOne.Beck said the batteries on the new launcher would produce just shy of one megawatt of power, enough to power a whole city block. The engine's electric propulsion cycle uses electric motors and lithium polymer batteries to drive its turbopumps at extremely high speeds. Rocket Lab aims to help companies that want to launch hundreds and thousands of small satellites into low-earth orbit to provide space-based access to the Internet, respond to natural disasters and improve crop yields.Beck said the company had been working on the Rutherford engine for the past year and a half, racing to meet growing demand from companies ranging from Google Inc to small Silicon Valley startups.

""We’re being interviewed for our job every day.""Valerio said the company is pushing to cut costs on existing programs by consolidating facilities, finding and testing new uses for additive manufacturing, or 3D printing, and standardizing parts across multiple satellites.He said it was also critical for Lockheed to improve its ties with the government officials who oversee those programs, and who will help shape those future business opportunities. ""We've had a reputation … of being arrogant, and we’re trying to wipe that out completely,"" Valerio said. He said he repeatedly told his entire staff that every interaction and every meeting influenced how the company was viewed.""It's all about relationships and trust and performance,"" he said. One key test will be how Lockheed fares in an Air Force competition for the next batch of global positioning satellites (GPS) satellites later this year after the current GPS III program was marred by delays.   Lockheed aims to deliver the first GPS III satellite for launch in May 2017, more than two years after the initial target date due to delays in delivery of the key navigational payload built by Exelis Inc XLS.N.The company is also awaiting a Pentagon study of satellites that provide early warning of enemy missile launches, such as Lockheed's Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS). Another key study is examining satellites that protect the president's ability to launch nuclear weapons in the event of a major war.Lockheed also builds the current Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) protected satellites, which aims to do just that. Both the early SBIRS and AEHF satellites saw huge cost overruns and delays but are now back on track. The Defense Department is evaluating its follow-on plans for both systems and possible alternative approaches. Doug Loverro, the Pentagon's top space policy official, told Reuters this week that both studies would be completed this summer, paving the way for future acquisition programs.Valerio said Lockheed also saw opportunities to sell missile warning and protected communications satellites to U.S. allies in coming years, but actual orders could take several years.

543,"   By Andrea Shalal | COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo.  COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. A joint venture of Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing Co on Wednesday said uncertainty over its use of Russian rocket engines for Air Force satellite launches could undermine its plans to build a new rocket with a U.S. engine. Tory Bruno, president of the United Launch Alliance joint venture, told Reuters that Lockheed and Boeing could halt investment in the new rocket unless ULA gets permission to use 29 already ordered Russian engines for Air Force launches.The company has pegged its future to the new Vulcan rocket, which it hopes to use for commercial and government launches. It was not immediately clear what would happen to the firm if it was unable to complete the new rocket.Bruno said the company's board last week approved investment in Vulcan through the end of the year but would not consider further funding until the issue of the Russian RD-180 engines that power its Atlas 5 rocket was resolved. Legislation passed by the U.S. Congress last year barred ULA from using engines for national security launches purchased after Russia's annexation of Ukraine's Crimea. ULA signed a 29-engine contract with Russia's Energomash before then, but Pentagon lawyers have determined that those engines cannot be used under the current law. Air Force officials have urged Congress to change the law. Bruno said the Air Force is also pursuing a waiver from the Pentagon that would allow the engines' use. Bruno said lawmakers did not intend to halt use of the rockets already ordered by the company, and they had not expected the legal determination later made by Pentagon lawyers.Barring a change, Bruno said ULA would be unable to compete for some Air Force orders that comprise a large part of the company's business between 2019 and when the new rocket is certified to launch government satellites around 2022 or 2023. The Air Force expects to certify a new competitor, privately held Space Exploration Technologies, to compete to launch some U.S. military and intelligence satellites by June. ULA is halting use of most of its Delta 4 rockets, which have a U.S.-built engine, because they are too costly to produce and would not be competitive, Bruno said.He said the company could have up to five RD-180 engines available for use after 2019, but it was unclear if the company could afford to stockpile engines valued at $125 million.

549,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The U.S. House Armed Services Committee's fiscal 2016 defense bill includes $1.15 billion in extra funding for 12 additional Boeing Co Super Hornet combat jets and $1 billion for six Lockheed Martin Corp F-35 B-model fighters.The committee is expected to mark up the proposed legislation on Wednesday, followed by its introduction in the full House of Representatives the week of May 11.Both funding requests were included in the ""unfunded priorities"" lists submitted to Congress by the Navy and Marine Corps this year. The Navy also requested 8 F-35 C-model planes that can land on an aircraft carrier, but the committee did not fund those jets in its proposed legislation.Roman Schweizer, an analyst with Guggenheim Partners, said the committee's decision to fund 12 more F/A-18E/F Super Hornets, along with reports that a Navy assessment had found a requirement for 30 more EA-18G electronic attack planes, meant Boeing might extend production at its plant in St. Louis. He cautioned, however, that the Senate Armed Services Committee still needed to include funding for the aircraft in its authorization bill, as did congressional appropriators.""We're a long way from anything being finalized,"" Schweizer said.Boeing must decide in June whether to self-fund titanium and other ""long-lead"" supplies for the F/A-18 and EA-18G fighter jets until the fiscal 2016 budget is finalized or allow the St. Louis line to shut down. The company is also bullish about landing a big Super Hornet order from a Middle Eastern country, which together with the Navy jets could keep the St. Louis line running through the end of 2018. [ID:nL5N0XD56U]A source familiar with the matter said Kuwait was expected to submit a formal letter of request and letter of acceptance for 28 F/A-18E/F jets to the U.S government in the near term. Boeing has said it needs to build two jets a month at the St. Louis facility to maintain current pricing. At that rate, funding for a dozen more jets would extend production through mid-2018, while the Kuwaiti order could push it out past 2019.Chief of Naval Operations Jonathan Greenert told Congress last month that the Navy faced a potential shortfall of up to 36 aircraft given delays in extending the life of its older-model F/A-18 aircraft.

550,"  (Refiles to change dateline to LINKOPING, Sweden, from Paris)LINKOPING, Sweden, April 27 Sweden's Saab AB  on Monday ruled out facilitating the sale of Gripen fighter aircraft to Argentina as the result of a deal to build and export combat jets from Brazil.Argentina has expressed interest in buying 24 Gripen fighter jets from its Latin American neighbour once Brazil is able to export them, early next decade.Such a deal would face an almost certain veto from Britain, which provides some 30 percent of the Gripen's content, including the radar on its next-generation Gripen E/F.Saab said it was not involved in any discussions involving Argentina.""Nobody has asked us to do that and we are not considering it,"" a spokesman said during a defence media briefing. Relations between Britain and Argentina remain tense since a war 33 years ago over the Falkland Islands, known as Las Malvinas in Argentina.Late last year, Brazilian defence officials forecast more demand for Saab Gripen aircraft, including from Argentina.Saab has sold 60 Gripen Es to Sweden and is finalizing an order for another 36 to Brazil, which will also co-develop a two-seat version Saab calls Gripen F and Brazilian officials call Gripen NG. Brazilian aircraft maker Embraer SA has said it hopes to devise a plan with Saab by June to export the Gripen from Brazil beginning in 2023.Saab officials said the first Gripen export from Brazil could come as early as 2022. The head of Saab's aeronautics division, Ulf Nilsson, said    the development programme for the Gripen E was on track, but he declined to outline details of the production ramp-up.Saab also said it was confident about plans with Boeing Co  to try to sell newly designed T-X training jets to the United States. But in a series of detailed briefings, Saab officials declined to discuss anything about the aircraft design, which remains strictly under wraps.The pair are expected to face competition from Northrop Grumman Corp, a team of Lockheed Martin Corp and Korea Aerospace Industries, and an alliance between General Dynamics Corp and Italy's Alenia Aermacchi, a unit of   Finmeccanica SpA.As with the Brazilian fighter deal, Saab is looking at potential exports if it wins the trainer competition.""When we looked into this, of course we wanted a global  market for trainers. I think it is a great market out there,"" deputy chief executive Lennart Sindahl said.

552,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The Pentagon's internal watchdog on Monday said it found 61 violations of quality management rules and policies during an inspection of Pratt & Whitney's work on the F-35 fighter jet engine and warned the problems could lead to further cost increases and schedule delays on the biggest U.S. arms program.More than half of the problems were deemed major and occurred at Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp, versus Pentagon agencies that oversee the program, according to the report by the Defense Department's inspector general's office. A major incident is one likely to result in the failure of the quality management system. The Defense Department buys the F135 engines under a separate contract with Pratt, while Lockheed Martin Corp builds the fighter jet's airframe.The U.S. military plans to spend $391 billion to develop and buy 2,457 F-35 warplanes and the needed engines in coming years. Pratt and the Pentagon are still correcting a design problem with the high-performance F135 engine that grounded the F-35 fleet last year, but that was not due to manufacturing issues. However, quality issues have grounded the fleet in the past.Earlier this month, the congressional Government Accountability Office also faulted the reliability of the F135 engine.Pratt and the Pentagon's F-35 program office said they had taken aggressive steps to address the findings of the inspector general's two-week review in November. Pratt stressed the audit focused on the company's quality management process and said none of the problems affected the performance of the engines, or the safety and capability of the aircraft. The company said it had implemented plans to correct 60 percent of the issues raised and would complete all but one by July. The final issue would be addressed by year-end, it said.The inspector general's office also faulted the Pentagon's  F-35 joint program office and Defense Contract Management Agency for insufficient oversight, citing systemic problems in the areas of program management oversight, safety compliance, risk and supplier management, and software quality management.  The Pentagon's F-35 office said it disagreed with three of six findings in the report and warned that increasing oversight of software and other items would add time and costs.Given the large number of issues identified, the report said the F-35 joint program office should expect growing rates of quality problems, which may affect engine performance, schedule, and cost.

555,"  WASHINGTON Lieutenant Colonel Christine Mau, a U.S. Air Force pilot who    was part of the first all-female combat sortie over Afghanistan in 2011, this week became the first woman to fly the Lockheed Martin Corp F-35 jet, the Air Force said on Wednesday.Mau, deputy commander of the 33rd Fighter Wing Operations Group, on Tuesday completed her first training flight in the single-seat stealth fighter after 14 virtual training missions in a simulator, said spokeswoman Lieutenant Hope Cronin.Mau joined 87 F-35A pilots who have been trained over the last four years at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida.

565,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON United Launch Alliance, a joint venture of Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) and Boeing Co (BA.N), on Friday said it was cutting its executive ranks by 30 percent in December through what it called voluntary departures by 12 executives. Tory Bruno, chief executive of the venture, told Reuters in an emailed statement the layoffs were part of ULA's ongoing efforts to adapt to what he called ""an increasingly competitive business environment"" and redesign its leadership team.ULA, formed by the two largest U.S. weapons makers in 2006, has long been the sole company able to launch U.S. military and intelligence satellites into orbit, but the Air Force expects to certify a new rival, privately-held Space Exploration Technologies, to compete for some of those launches next month.The company is also under pressure from a new law that limits its use of the Russian RD-180 rocket engines that power its Atlas 5 launch vehicles after 2019. Congress passed the law after Russia annexed the Crimea region of Ukraine last year. ""ULA's back is to the wall,"" said defense consultant Loren Thompson. ""Unless it gets relief from the congressional mandate on getting off Russian rockets and it can't speed up its  alternative, then its business model is severely impaired.""Bruno told Reuters last month that Boeing and Lockheed could halt investment in a new U.S.-powered rocket unless the company got permission to use a number of Russian engines ordered but not paid for before the invasion of Crimea. Without those engines, ULA would be unable to compete for some critical Air Force launches between 2019 and 2022, when the new rocket is expected to be certified. Bruno announced the layoffs internally on Wednesday in what some employees have dubbed the ""Mother's Day Massacre,"" given its timing just after the holiday last weekend.""It is important for ULA to move forward early in the process with our leadership selections to ensure a seamless transition and our continued focus on mission success,"" Bruno said in response to a query from Reuters about the layoffs. He thanked the 12 executives for their dedication and said they would leave the company on Dec. 31 to ensure a seamless transition period with the new organization.The names of the departing executives were not immediately available. It was unclear what kind of incentives they got to leave voluntarily.Bruno was named to replace Michael Gass as chief executive and president of ULA in August, shortly before the company announced it was teaming with entrepreneur Jeff Bezos to develop a new launch vehicle powered by a U.S.-built engine. Bruno told Reuters in an interview in February the company would slash costs and hunt out new customers to ensure continued growth despite the rise of its new rival,He acknowledged questions about whether the company could generate enough revenues and profits to keep both its shareholders happy, but said he planned to transform the company by halving the cost and cycle time of current launches.The management layoffs marked the beginning of a major reorganization and redesign, company officials said.

566,"  (Repeats story with no change to text)By Andrea ShalalWASHINGTON May 15 A U.S.-supplied missile shield to protect Gulf nations against Iranian attacks will take years to complete, requiring a step-up in regional trust, more U.S. sales of sensitive weapons, and intensive U.S. training to avoid mishaps in the volatile region.A renewed joint commitment to build the regional defense system was one of the few firm outcomes of Thursday's Camp David summit between President Barack Obama and Gulf allies, which were seeking fresh U.S. defense pledges ahead of a possible nuclear deal they fear will empower arch-rival Iran.Past efforts have stalled due to tension and mistrust within the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) but U.S. and Gulf officials say the time is now ripe to push ahead as Arab nations mount more joint military missions.A joint statement following the summit said that the GCC states were committed to developing a ballistic missile defense capability, including an early warning system, with U.S. technical help. Washington pledged to fast-track arms transfers to the GCC states and to send a team to the region in the coming weeks to discuss the details.The Gulf nations fear that the sanctions relief that would accompany a nuclear deal with Tehran due by June 30 could revive Iran's economy and enable it to acquire more accurate and reliable missiles.An integrated defense system would allow Gulf countries to better repel an Iranian attack, stitching together their radars and interceptors to counter a range of different missiles.The system would use U.S. early-warning satellites and a mix of U.S. and Gulf radars to detect the launch of an enemy missile and fire a ground- or sea-based missile to destroy it far above the earth. CLOSER SHARING NEEDED Lockheed Martin Corp, Raytheon Co. and Northrop Grumman Corp would be key contenders to build a central command-and-control system for the shield since they already do similar work for the U.S. military and key allies.The biggest challenge to making the shield work would be securing a broad agreement on the rules for dealing with any threats, said Anthony Cordesman, a senior analyst with the Center for Strategic and International Studies.""You have to work out the entire engagement structure before the first missile is ever launched,"" Cordesman said. Getting to that point will require unprecedented agreements between the U.S. military and the GCC, and among the often rancorous Gulf allies, to share sensitive data to avoid the risk of a friendly aircraft being shot down by mistake, experts said.Intensive U.S.-led training would also be vital to minimize the risk of mishaps, U.S. officials say.The U.S. military already has 10 Patriot missile batteries to defend against short-range ballistic missiles in the Gulf region and Jordan, as well as a powerful AN-TPY-2 radar system to scan for missile launches, according to U.S. officials.The Gulf countries are upgrading their existing Raytheon Patriot systems to incorporate new PAC-3 missiles built by Raytheon and Lockheed Martin Corp, and are starting to buy wider-area and longer-range systems like the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), built by Lockheed.Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir told reporters in Washington this week that Gulf countries would need new ground-based networks and computer terminals to manage those systems. He said the Gulf countries also wanted longer-range options like the Raytheon SM-3 missile, which has not yet been released for export to the region.Washington has balked at selling a land-based Aegis combat system to deal with missile threats and any associated SM-3 missiles to Gulf countries, largely because such a system would be best suited to dealing with threats outside the earth's atmosphere that are beyond Iran's capability, Cordesman said.Washington's decision in December to allow U.S. arms sales to the GCC as an organization - similar to its arrangement with NATO - helped pave the way for progress on integrating missile defense and maritime security systems.""That's a huge step in the right direction,"" said a U.S. official, who was not authorized to speak publicly.Cordesman said Raytheon's new SM-6 missile could prove useful to address Gulf concerns since it could address threats inside the earth's atmosphere as well as outside.U.S. officials had no immediate comment on whether the Gulf countries had made any formal request for the SM-6 system.Al-Jubeir cautioned against expecting rapid progress on missile defense integration.""Those are complicated systems that take time to acquire and then take time to put in place,"" he said.

He said the Gulf countries also wanted longer-range options like the Raytheon SM-3 missile, which has not yet been released for export to the region.Washington has balked at selling a land-based Aegis combat system to deal with missile threats and any associated SM-3 missiles to Gulf countries, largely because such a system would be best suited to dealing with threats outside the earth's atmosphere that are beyond Iran's capability, Cordesman said.Washington's decision in December to allow U.S. arms sales to the GCC as an organization - similar to its arrangement with NATO - helped pave the way for progress on integrating missile defense and maritime security systems.""That's a huge step in the right direction,"" said a U.S. official, who was not authorized to speak publicly.Cordesman said Raytheon's new SM-6 missile could prove useful to address Gulf concerns since it could address threats inside the earth's atmosphere as well as outside.U.S. officials had no immediate comment on whether the Gulf countries had made any formal request for the SM-6 system.Al-Jubeir cautioned against expecting rapid progress on missile defense integration.""Those are complicated systems that take time to acquire and then take time to put in place,"" he said. ""You can't buy these things off the shelf and take them home the day you buy them ... One has to come before the other.""

571,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON May 14 The U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee on Thursday approved a  2016 defense policy bill that maps out a series of acquisition reforms and adds funding for big weapons programs like Boeing Co's F/A-18 Super Hornets and Lockheed Martin Corp's  F-35 fighter jet.Committee Chairman John McCain, an Arizona Republican, told reporters the committee trimmed $10 billion in ""excess and unnecessary funding"" from the Pentagon's proposed budget, including $460 million removed from Air Force funding request for a new long-range strike bomber, to fund the extra weapons.Most of the funds went to ""unfunded priorities"" identified by the military services, including $1.2 billion for the 12 Boeing jets requested by the U.S. Navy, and $1 billion for six Lockheed jets requested by the Marine Corps, the committee said.McCain, a longtime critic of the $391 billion F-35 fighter jet program, the Pentagon's costliest arms project, said the program was doing better and the Marine Corps planned to declare its F-35B jets ready for initial combat use in July. The bill holds back $900 million of the Air Force's $5.2 billion F-35 budget until the defense secretary certifies that F-35 A-model planes delivered in fiscal 2018 would have full combat capability with the 3F software currently planned.The bill also added $355 million to maintain the Air Force's fleet of A-10 Thunderbolt attack aircraft, an ongoing source of friction between Congress and the Air Force. It also raised proposed funding for the Virginia-class submarine program submarines built by General Dynamics Corp  and Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc N> by $800 million to $6.1 billion, underscoring the importance of building two submarines a year from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2020.The committee limited funding aircraft carriers and coastal warships until the Navy met certain conditions. The bill would also reform what it called the Pentagon's ""woefully inefficient"" and ""broken"" acquisition system, calling it a clear and present danger to U.S. national security. It seeks to increase accountability, reach out to non-traditional suppliers, and streamline the process to save money.Senator Jack Reed, the top Democrat on the panel, and three other Democrats voted against the bill, citing concerns about using overseas contingency operations funding, or OCO, to pay for non-war items. Reed called that move a ""budget gimmick.""Representative Adam Smith, the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, voted against his committee's bill for the same reason.(Reporting by Andrea Shalal; Editing by Diane Craft)",2015-05-15,LMT,"Thu May 14, 2015 | 9:26pm EDT","U.S. Senate defense bill funds Boeing, Lockheed jets",http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-congress-arms-budget-idUSL1N0Y601J20150515?type=companyNews

573,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Lockheed Martin Corp said on Monday it is working to resolve ""relatively minor"" issues with a portable version of the F-35 fighter jet's automated logistics system, but the problems should not impede a Marine Corp milestone this summer.Jeff Streznetcky, the Lockheed executive in charge of the logistics system known as ALIS, told Reuters the company was working with the Pentagon's F-35 program office to fix the software that runs the new version of ALIS. He said the system remained on track to be deployed in late June or early July.""I'm not expecting any showstoppers that would cause me any alarm,"" Streznetcky said in a telephone interview. He stressed the system would not be deployed until it was ready to meet the Marine Corps' operating requirements.ALIS enables daily operations of the F-35 fleet, including mission planning, scheduling for flights, repairs and routine maintenance, and tracking and ordering of parts. Lockheed is scrambling to complete a smaller, lighter version of the F-35's complex Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS), ahead of July, when the Marine Corps plans to declare an initial squadron of 10 F-35s ready for combat use. Joe DellaVedova, spokesman for the Pentagon's F-35 office, confirmed that some issues were detected during testing of the latest ALIS software, but said the needed fixes should be completed in time to avoid holding up the Marine Corps' plans.Neither the F-35 program office or Lockheed gave any  details about specific problems detected with the latest ALIS software, version 2.0.1, which has been tested since late April. ALIS will serve as the management ""backbone"" for a global fleet of over 3,000 F-35s to be operated by three U.S. military services and other countries. The Pentagon expects to pay $391 billion to develop the jets and buy 2,457 jets in coming decades. ALIS is so big and costly it constitutes a major arms program on its own.Air Force acquisition chief William LaPlante last week said ALIS was ""continuing to improve"" after early problems, including slow response times. He said officials were working to speed up downloads of data from the jets and iron out problems with the system's ability to load detailed mission data files.Six U.S. Marine F-35 B-model jets, which can take off from shorter runways and land like a helicopter, are slated to begin operational testing on the USS Wasp on Monday. The larger, earlier version of ALIS was installed on the ship ahead of the test and used to maintain the jets participating in the tests, Streznetcky said. He forecast a ""seamless transition"" once the jets arrived on board from Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort in South Carolina.ALIS systems are in now use at nine air bases and a final assembly plant in Italy, Streznetcky said.

576,"  (Adds letter from German defence official, background)PARIS/BERLIN May 20 France's defence ministry has pencilled several hundreds of millions of euros into its latest defence budget for the possible purchase of four Lockheed-Martin C130 Hercules military transport planes due to problems with the rival Airbus A400M, a defence ministry source said on Wednesday.The source said a decision on whether to make the purchase would be made before the end of this year.""We have to address the problem presented to tactical air transport by the overuse of the Transall and the problems over deliveries of the A400M,"" said the source. The Franco-German C160 Transall is an older military transport plane.On Tuesday, Airbus ordered engine software checks to be carried out on A400Ms following a fatal crash of one of the troop and cargo carriers on May 9.In April, the French defence procurement agency denied a report in French aviation magazine Air et Cosmos that it was considering the purchase of four C130 Hercules airlifters. The French defence ministry source said a revised budget for 2014-19 included a provision of several hundred million euros for the possible C130 possible.Paris will also bring forward to 2017-18 the purchase of the last three of 12 Airbus aircraft refuelling planes, the source added. Originally those planes, which also serve as troop carriers, had fallen outside the 2014-19 budgeting period. The C130 budgeting exercise may increase pressure on Airbus in talks on possible penalties for delays to the A400M, though many defence analysts say it is unlikely France's plan to buy older planes is more than a contingency proposal at this stage.Airbus declined to comment.Germany has also been piling pressure on Airbus over the latest delays in supplying tactical features on the A400Ms. A senior defence ministry official told the budgetary committee that Berlin estimates it will have to keep its Transall planes in service for up to three further years as a result of the delays, according to a letter seen by Reuters.There is a risk that the A400M will get a rocket defence system 12 to 24 months later than planned and the ministry has therefore examined whether the Transall can be used up until 2021, the official, Ralf Brauksiepe, wrote.Citing comments by another official, Handelsblatt newspaper reported that using the Transall for longer could result in extra costs of up to 300 million euros.The German government was due to receive the A400M with the self-defence system by 2016 and was intending to replace the Transalls by the end of 2018.

579,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON May 19 The U.S. Marine Corps is ""tracking very well"" toward declaring a squadron of 10 F-35 jets built by Lockheed Martin Corp ready for initial combat use by July 15, Lieutenant General Jon Davis, the top general in charge of Marine Corps aviation, said on Tuesday.In a step toward that goal, the Marine Corps will use an MV-22 tilt-rotor aircraft to transport part of the engine of the F-35 fighter jet to the USS Wasp amphibious ship during two weeks of testing that began Monday, Davis said.""Unless something really weird happens, I think we'll be fine,"" he told reporters. He said he would not recommend the move until after a two-week operational readiness inspection showed the squadron was ready.Six U.S. F-35B fighter jets landed on the USS Wasp on Monday, a milestone for the $391 billion F-35 fighter jet program as it nears the July declaration of ""initial operational capability,"" or IOC. [ID:nL1N0Y92BV} Davis said he would observe the testing during a trip to the USS Wasp, operating off the coast of Virginia, on Wednesday.He will determine how easily the jets can be maneuvered around the flight deck and how well they can be repaired at sea, including possible work on the jet's F135 engine, built by Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp. The jet engine can be broken down into five parts for transport in protective cases that can be flown on an MV-22 Osprey and swapped out in case they were needed for repairs.Davis said one of the modules would be flown to the ship to assess the difficulty of completing engine repair at sea. He said no actual swapout was planned unless necessary. The testing will also assess the automated logistics system called ALIS. Davis said the system was performing ""pretty well"" and allowed jets to be serviced and returned to the flight line in about two hours, generally in line with other aircraft.A new portable version of the ALIS system was also making progress, he said, but it would not include the engine until December after more software changes. For now, he said, technicians needed separate laptops to service the engines.Lockheed on Monday said it was working to resolve ""relatively minor"" issues with the portable version of ALIS, but the problems should not impede the Marine Corps' ability to declare the jets ready for combat this summer.

582,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON United Launch Alliance, a 50-50 joint venture of Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing Co, on Thursday said it would go out of business unless it won commercial and civil satellite launch orders to offset an expected slump in U.S. military and spy launches.ULA President Tory Bruno said the company must attract those kind of orders to remain a ""viable economic entity"" so it is scrambling to restructure and develop a new rocket that in seven or eight years could launch satellites twice as fast at half the current cost.Formed by the two largest U.S. weapons makers in 2006, ULA has long been the sole company able to launch U.S. military and intelligence satellites into orbit. It will face competition for the first time when the Air Force expects to certify a rival, privately held Space Exploration Technologies, to bid on some of those launches. That certification is expected next month.ULA is also under pressure from a federal ban on use for national security launches after 2019 of the Russian RD-180 rocket engines that power its Atlas 5 rockets. Congress passed the law after Russia annexed the Crimea region of Ukraine. Bruno said the number of U.S. military and intelligence satellite launches would likely drop in coming years to about five launches a year from 10 to 12, with the smaller number to be split among two or more rivals.""We have to ... access commercial and civil opportunities. (We) cannot survive on two launches a year,"" Bruno told a lunch meeting hosted by the Washington Space Business Roundtable.Bruno last week announced a 30-percent cut in management as part of the restructuring.  On Thursday he said Boeing and Lockheed were still approving investment in the new Vulcan rocket only one quarter at a time given uncertainty about how Russian engines the company can use to compete for national security launches.He said the Air Force had a strong argument to request a Pentagon waiver if Congress continues to block use of Russian engines ordered but not paid for before the Crimea invasion. Barring a waiver or change in the current law, ULA would only be able to compete for five Air Force launches between 2019 and 2022, when the new rocket is expected to be certified. ULA says its other rocket, the Delta 4, costs too much to compete.""We must have access to the Atlas as a competitive platform until we have the replacement rocket engine. There really is no Plan B,"" he said.

585,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The U.S. Air Force on Tuesday said it has certified privately held SpaceX to launch U.S. military and spy satellites, ending a monopoly held by United Launch Alliance, a joint venture of Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing Co, since its creation in 2006.The decision follows two years of discussions, reviews and legal disputes between the U.S. Air Force and Space Exploration Technologies, known as SpaceX, and means the company founded by entrepreneur Elon Musk, can compete for national security launches with its Falcon 9 rocket.""SpaceX's emergence as a viable commercial launch provider provides the opportunity to compete launch services for the first time in almost a decade,"" Air Force Secretary Deborah James said in a statement.Leveraging SpaceX's investment in an alternate launch vehicle would help drive down the cost and help improve the U.S. military's resiliency, James said.SpaceX's first opportunity to compete against ULA would come in June, when the Air Force said it expects to kick off a competition for launches of additional Global Positioning System III satellites built by Lockheed. The certification, initially expected last December, followed two years of intensive reviews by the Air Force and SpaceX, which already has won significant contracts with NASA to launch cargo and crews to the International Space Station.The Air Force said it spent more than $60 million and dedicated 150 people to the effort, which included 2,800 discreet tasks, three certification flight demonstrations, 21 major subsystem reviews and 700 audits aimed at establishing a technical baseline for future flight worthiness determinations.Musk called the decision ""an important step toward bringing competition to national security space launch."" Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain said he hoped SpaceX's certification would bring down what he called ""unjustifiably high"" launch costs and end U.S. reliance on Russian-built RD-180 engines that power ULA's Atlas 5 rocket.The U.S. Congress has banned the use of Russian engines for national security launches after 2019. It passed the law after Russia's annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region last year. James called the news ""an important milestone"" for the Air Force and the Pentagon. An independent review in March cited a ""stark disconnect"" between the two sides about the purpose of the certification process, and said the Air Force's approach had stifled the very competition it was seeking to promote.SpaceX had shocked Air Force officials when it filed a lawsuit in April 2014 to protest its decision to award 36 rocket launches to ULA while delaying competition for 14 contracts that were meant to be open to competition.The company dropped its lawsuit in January after the two sides agreed to work collaboratively to wrap up the certification process.

589,"  (Adds details, update on Marine Corps testing)By Andrea ShalalWASHINGTON May 29 The Pentagon said Friday it would talk to U.S. lawmakers about approving a three-year block buy of Lockheed Martin Corp F-35 fighter jets beginning in fiscal 2018 that would include U.S. purchases and international buyers.U.S. Defense Undersecretary Frank Kendall told reporters via teleconference from Oslo, Norway, that such a deal would not constitute a formal ""multi-year buy,"" but would still require congressional approval.A block buy of more than 400 jets would allow for ""double-digit"" cost savings from larger economies of scale when orders reach around 150 planes a year, said Kendall, who was attending an annual meeting of top U.S., international and industry officials on the F-35 program. Kendall, the Pentagon's chief arms buyer, said the $391 billion F-35 program was meeting or exceeding performance and cost milestones set during a 2011 restructuring of the program.It remained on track for a key milestone this summer when the U.S. Marine Corps expects to declare an initial squadron of jets ready for combat use, followed by the Air Force in 2016. ""I'm very encouraged by the progress that we're making,"" he said.Kendall said he saw a ""fundamental change"" during this year's ""CEO"" meeting, away from past technical challenges and toward fielding jets, future upgrades, and how to maintain and operate thousands of jets around the world in coming years. Lowering production and operating costs remained a key priority. Lockheed and engine maker Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp, service the aircraft under traditional contracts with the Pentagon, but officials hope to shift to more fixed-price ""performance-based logistics"" deals in coming years.Such contracts typically generate savings of 15 percent by allowing companies to sign longer-term orders with suppliers.Lieutenant General Jon Davis, the top Marine in charge of aviation, said six F-35 B-model jets this week completed 108 flights and flew 85.5 total hours during operational testing on board the assault ship USS Wasp.Lockheed is building three F-35 models for the U.S. military and eight partners that funded the jet's development: Britain, Norway, Canada, Denmark, the Netherlands, Italy, Turkey and Australia. Israel, Japan and South Korea have also placed orders.

590,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Lockheed Martin Corp's F-35 fighter jet will drop weapons and take part in a major U.S. military exercise this week for the first time, another milestone for the Pentagon's largest weapons program, Air Force officials said Monday.The exercise, called ""Green Flag West,"" tests the U.S. military's ability to engage in air-to-surface conflicts and helps get ground troops who pinpoint potential air strikes ready for combat.Several F-35 A-model jets, along with a host of other warplanes and other weapons, will participate in the exercises.General Herbert Carlisle, commander of Air Combat Command, told Reuters that exercises were an important way to expose weapons and pilots to more real-world battle scenarios. ""It's incredibly important that you've got to get past just the theoretical ... to get it into the fog and friction of dynamic environment that is changing rapidly,"" Carlisle said after an event hosted by the Air Force Association.The Air Force has used aircraft equipped with F-35 sensors in past exercises, but this will be the first time that more ""operationally representative"" aircraft take part, he said. Lockheed is developing three models of the aircraft for the U.S. military, eight countries that help fund its development, and three other nations. U.S. officials say the $391 billion weapons program has been meeting or exceeding its performance and cost targets since a major restructuring in 2011.Carlisle said the Air Force was still working through some problems with how data from various radars and other sensors are fused and displayed to the pilot, but he expected the aircraft to perform well in the exercise. ""The airplane's pretty impressive,"" Carlisle said. He said the jet's radar-evading capabilities and large number of sensors would help improve the performance of all other U.S. aircraft in a fight, much like the F-22 does now.The Marine Corps is expected to declare an initial squadron of 10 F-35B jets ready for initial combat use in July, with the Air Force to follow suit in August 2016.

592,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON, June 1  WASHINGTON, June 1 The U.S. Air Force on Monday said it aims to meet electronic warfare needs using next-generation aircraft such as Lockheed Martin Corp's  F-35 fighter and a new long-range bomber, rather than older planes like Boeing Co's EA-18G Growler.Air Combat Command Commander General Herbert Carlisle said the F-35 offered ""some pretty impressive"" electronic warfare  capabilities - consisting of jamming enemy signals to make it easier for warplanes to bomb targets on the ground and other offensive actions - though he gave no details.Carlisle said a bomber for which a contract will be awarded in coming months, and the associated ""family of systems"" to be rolled out in coming years, would also give the Air Force new electronic warfare capabilities.""With the limited (budget), you've got to think harder about buying brand new legacy airplanes versus the next generation as we go forward,"" Carlisle told reporters after an event hosted by the Air Force Association booster group. The comments come as Boeing is trying to secure enough orders to keep its F/A-18E/F and EA-18G fighter lines running in St. Louis. Congress is poised to add funding for 12 more jets, but the budget measures have not yet been finalized.The Navy order, together with a likely Kuwait order for 28 jets, should keep the production line open into 2019. U.S. Navy officials have said they have enough Boeing EA-18G Growlers to meet their own needs, but that a Navy-led study of the needs of the other services could generate demand for more of the jets for the Air Force and Marine Corps.However, neither of the services have endorsed that view, and a Navy-led study of the joint needs has not been released. Carlisle said he had not been fully briefed on the study, which was completed this spring, but his preference would be to opt for newer, next-generation aircraft like the bomber or F-35.Carlisle said he expected the Air Force to pick a winner in the bomber competition in July or possibly August.Boeing and Lockheed have teamed up to compete against Northrop Grumman Corp, builder of the B-2 bomber, for a contract valued at $50 to $80 billion.Lieutenant General Jon Davis, the top Marine in charge of aviation, has also expressed skepticism about the need for more Growlers, citing the capabilities offered by the F-35.

593,"  (Adds comments from Air Force official)By Andrea ShalalWASHINGTON, June 1 Lockheed Martin Corp's  F-35 fighter jet will play a major role in a large U.S. military exercise this week for the first time, marking another milestone for the Pentagon's largest weapons program, Air Force officials said Monday.The exercise, which is called ""Green Flag West"" and runs through June 12, tests the U.S. military's ability to engage in large-scale contested operations and helps get ground troops who pinpoint potential air strikes ready for combat.One or two F-35 A-model jets will participate in the exercises each day, along with F-16 fighter planes, A-10 gunships and other weapons, said Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Cameron Dadgar, who is charge of the exercise. ""This is the first time that the F-35 will be the primary player in this exercise,"" Dadgar told Reuters.The exercise includes about 5,000 U.S. military personnel with land, sea and ground forces all working together to fight a ""near peer"" enemy such as China or Russia, although no specific countries are named, he said.General Herbert Carlisle, commander of Air Combat Command, told Reuters that exercises were an important way to expose weapons and pilots to more real-world battle scenarios. ""You've got to get past just the theoretical ... to get it into the fog and friction of a dynamic environment that is changing rapidly,"" Carlisle said after an event hosted by the Air Force Association.F-35 jets have taken part on a spot basis in past Green Flag exercises, but this is the first time the new war plane will play a role in nearly every scenario, Dadgar said. Lockheed is developing three models of the aircraft for the U.S. military, eight countries that help fund its development, and three other nations. U.S. officials say the $391 billion weapons program has been meeting or exceeding its performance and cost targets since a major restructuring in 2011.Carlisle said the Air Force was still addressing issues with how data from various radars and other sensors are fused, but he expected the aircraft to perform well in the exercise.""The airplane's pretty impressive,"" Carlisle said.

594,"  (Adds details throughout about workers, company's business)By Andrea ShalalWASHINGTON, June 2 Sikorsky Aircraft, a unit of United Technologies Corp, on Tuesday said it would cut 1,400 jobs and consolidate facilities, with lower oil prices sharply reducing demand for helicopters in the oil and gas sectors, and international military orders down.Sikorsky spokesman Paul Jackson confirmed the job cuts, in which workers and the company's union were notified earlier Tuesday, but said the move was not related to the parent company's ongoing review of strategic options for Sikorsky.""Today's announcement is based on the current challenging market conditions and is independent of United Technologies' ongoing review of strategic options for Sikorsky,"" said spokesman Paul Jackson. ""The two are completely unrelated.""Reuters reported last month that Airbus Group, Boeing and Lockheed Martin Corp were exploring options for a deal, although a steep $3 billion tax bill associated with an outright sale was dampening interest. Potential bids were due on Monday.United Technologies also shook up Sikorsky's management in April, naming Robert Leduc to succeed Mick Maurer as the company's president.""Sustained decreases in oil prices continue to drive significant declines in capital investments by oil companies in offshore oil exploration projects impacting Sikorsky and resulting in reduced production levels,"" Jackson said. He said demand for certain international military products had also dropped.United Technologies in April cited pressure in the oil and gas sector as it reported an 11 percent drop in Sikorsky's first-quarter operating profit and a 7 percent decline in sales. A huge chunk of Sikorsky's nonmilitary business is for oil industry customers shuttling workers and equipment to offshore rigs. Efforts by energy companies to reduce expenses due to the drop in oil prices are rippling through the helicopter industry.The company told workers and the Teamsters union that the  job cuts would affect Sikorsky's facilities in Poland, Pennsylvania and Connecticut, and would take place over the next twelve months starting immediately.The layoffs will affect 342 Sikorsky employees and 560 contractors in the United States, as well as 510 workers in Poland. The company has a total workforce of around 15,300.It told employees it planned to vacate smaller satellite facilities and consolidate remaining production into larger sites in Poland, Pennsylvania, and Connecticut.The company said it would also close its current facility in Bridgeport, Connecticut, and move workers to its Stratford, Connecticut facility.

595,"  (Adds comment from Lockheed Martin)By Krista HughesWASHINGTON, June 3 Ramping up a campaign to shut down the U.S. Export-Import Bank, Republican lawmakers on Wednesday accused the federal export financing bank of exposing U.S. taxpayers to losses over the foundering of an Australian satellite project.Ex-Im in 2012 authorized a $280 million loan for Australian firm NewSat's purchase of a satellite from U.S.-based aerospace group Lockheed Martin. NewSat earlier this year was placed in administration.Critics of Ex-Im, who want the bank to close when its current mandate expires on June 30, pounced on the deal to hammer home charges of taxpayer risk and accuse Ex-Im Chairman Fred Hochberg of lax management.""You've lost $100 million and you've given a several-hundred-million-dollar windfall to Lockheed Martin at the expense of the taxpayer,"" Republican Representative Mick Mulvaney said at a congressional committee hearing. Hochberg said Ex-Im's involvement was secured by NewSat, which still had control of the satellite, and it was in negotiations to find an alternate buyer.""We are working with Lockheed and other creditors to find a solution so we actually do not suffer a loss in this case,"" he said, defending the decision to fund the Jabiru-1 project, which would be Australia's only privately owned commercial satellite. The bank, which provides support to U.S. exporters as well as the buyers of U.S. goods, returned a $675 million surplus to federal coffers in 2014. It will have to halt new lending on June 30 unless its term is renewed. No date has yet been set to vote on an extension.The bank has a default rate of well below 1 percent, lower than most commercial banks, and its supporters say it plays a key role in underwriting loans shunned by commercial banks.Ex-Im said when it approved the NewSat loan, the deal would support 250 Lockheed jobs and more than 650 positions at related suppliers. But the project ran into financial difficulties, forcing the company to overhaul its board, cut costs, and raise extra capital as costs increased and its shares plummeted.NewSat was placed under administration in April, weeks after another key lender, Europe's COFACE Lender Group, withdrew support for the $650 million launch.NewSat said about $62 million was outstanding on the COFACE loan and $160 million from other backers remained frozen.The U.S. Bankruptcy Court of Delaware issued an order last month effectively terminating the contract between NewSat and Lockheed Martin, Lockheed Martin said. ""We are currently reviewing our options for the future,"" a company spokeswoman said.

598,"  (Adds details, F-35 program office comment)By Andrea ShalalWASHINGTON, June 5 The U.S. Air Force on Friday said last year's catastrophic F-35 engine failure, which grounded the entire fleet of jets built by Lockheed Martin Corp  for a month, cost over $50 million.The Air Force's Air Education and Training Command said its investigation of the June 23 mishap involving the F135 engine built for the jet by Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp, showed the mishap was caused by a failure of the third-stage rotor of the engine's fan module.The completion of the official accident investigation board confirmed details widely reported after the accident, which prevented the F-35 from making its international debut at two UK air shows last year. It also contained the first estimate of the cost of the incident, in which part of the engine broke off, cut through an internal fuel tank and triggered a fire that burned the rear two thirds of the jet.""Pieces of the failed rotor arm cut through the engine's fan case, the engine bay, an internal fuel tank, and hydraulic and fuel lines before exiting through the aircraft's upper fuselage,"" the Air Force said. ""The total mishap damage is estimated to be in excess $50 million."" The Air Force said its report covered only the immediate causes of the mishap and relied on data from the time of the incident, not further subsequent analysis.The Pentagon's F-35 program office welcomed the review and said the F-35 fleet was flying and training at full capacity today. ""Operations are fully-restored, with engine fixes in place in production and in the fleet,"" said Joe DellaVedova, spokesman for the F-35 program office.He said the program had caught up on testing and training deferred as a result of the mishap, and the incident had only a ""negligible impact"" on the planned timetable for the military services to declare the planes ready for initial combat use.Pratt spokesman Matthew Bates said the company had developed one short-term fix to allow the F-35 fleet to resume flying within 25 days and a longer-term redesign. The latter was now being incorporated into engines in current production and in the field, and should be complete by early 2016, he said.He said Pratt's engines also exceeded the government's reliability requirements by 47 percent for jets being built for the Air Force and Navy, and by 19 percent for the B-model jets, built for the Marine Corps.

601,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The U.S. Air Force said on Tuesday it will use Lockheed Martin Corp's updated A2100 spacecraft for the fifth and sixth U.S. missile early warning satellites, with no additional cost to its 2014 bulk purchase contract with Lockheed.The Air Force said by swapping out the spacecraft for the next two Space Based Infrared System satellites, it will be easier to implement new capabilities, including sensors that would allow troops to see dimmer targets more quickly.The move followed a proposal made by Lockheed last December aimed at lowering costs by increasing commonality with other space systems, making the spacecraft more resilient, and reducing the number of obsolescent parts. In a statement, the Air Force's Space and Missile Systems Center said the change also offered the potential for major cost savings on future satellite purchases, and would make it easier to modernize on-board sensors in the future. Mike Guetlein, who heads the Air Force's Remote Sensing System Directorate, said it restructured its contract to ""appropriately share cost risk"" with the company, and rebalance the incentives between cost, schedule and system performance.Mark Valerio, who oversees Lockheed's military space business, told Reuters the switch would allow Lockheed to cut the cost of the seven and eighth SBIRS satellites by 20 to 30 percent, if the Air Force decided to proceed with those orders.Air Force officials have said they expect to finish a review of alternatives for the next missile warning satellites this summer, which would pave the way for a decision about potential follow-on contracts for a seventh and eighth SBIRS satellite. Lockheed began work on the modernized A2100 satellite ""bus"" in late 2011, partly due to the high rate of obsolescent parts on the earlier SBIRS vehicle. Valerio said the obsolescence rate was now below 5 percent from around 15 percent in 2011.Switching to the new spacecraft will result in some higher integration costs initially, but should lower costs in coming years as the company benefits from larger economic order quantities and a streamlined manufacturing process, he said.

German Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen announced the decision and said MEADS would make it possible to put a protective shield around entire cities and military camps.Von der Leyen said Germany plans to keep the huge new procurement program on track by setting up specific controls and  milestones. If the companies fail to meet those targets, Germany could still cancel the contract and give Patriot maker Raytheon another chance at the deal, she said.German opposition parties criticized the decision to proceed with the MEADs program, saying there were significant technical, financial and strategic concerns about the system. Lockheed and MBDA, a consortium that includes Italy's Finmeccanica SpA, Airbus Group and Britain's BAE Systems Plc, hailed the German decision.MBDA said MEADS would give the German military a powerful state-of-the-art system that can handle current and future threats, and said it recognized its responsibility in building a solid basis for the successful introduction of the system. Lockheed, the largest U.S. weapons maker, said in a statement that it was fully committed to the success of Germany's Taktisches Luftverteidigungssystem (TVLS) with MBDA.It said the system was designed to significantly reduce operation and support costs by covering a larger area with less manpower and equipment, and less demand on airlift.Raytheon said in a statement that it had not been formally notified of any decision by the German government, and would continue to support its ""consideration of alternatives prior to a final contract award"".The United States, citing budget cuts, opted out of the system in 2012.

609,"  (Adds quotes, details)By Andrea ShalalPARIS, June 14 Lockheed Martin Corp  issued a warning on Sunday over prospects for its rocket launch joint venture with Boeing Co, saying it urgently needed the United States to waive a law banning the use of Russian engines to launch military and spy satellites.Rick Ambrose, who heads Lockheed's space business, told Reuters in an interview that concerns about the United Launch Alliance (ULA) venture's prospects had prompted the partners to approve funding for its new U.S.-powered Vulcan rocket only one quarter at time.He said it was ""prudent"" for the partners to proceed cautiously, given uncertainty about both ULA's ability to use its Russian-powered Atlas 5 rocket for military and intelligence satellites, and growing competition in the commercial market. The U.S. Air Force last month certified privately held Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX, to compete for some of the national security launches, plunging ULA into a competitive market for the first time since its creation in 2006.The company has said it needs a waiver to keep using its Atlas 5 launch vehicle, which is powered by the Russian RD-180 engine, until the new U.S. rocket is ready for use. The company also has a U.S. powered engine called Delta 4, but it is too expensive to compete against SpaceX's cheaper Falcon 9 rocket.""It's unclear whether there's sufficient market to maintain two companies,"" Ambrose said in his frankest comments to date on the difficult climate facing the launch venture. He said the Atlas 5 rocket was only now starting to break even after billions of dollars of investment by the U.S. government and the companies. That highlighted the risks involved in the space business, he said.Ambrose said the U.S. Air Force was expected to ask top Pentagon officials to waive a provision of a 2015 law that bans use of any RD-180 engines purchased after Russia's annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region in 2014. ULA argues that it should be allowed to use engines included in an umbrella contract before that had not been fully paid for. He said more details about the terms and scope of any waiver should emerge within a month. Those details would also help Lockheed and Boeing decide whether to approve another large purchase of Russian engines that ULA is considering.""We need to make sure that we can close the business case,"" Ambrose said. ""You don't know what's going to happen with U.S. policy, as well as the market shifts.""Ambrose noted that Japan and China were getting into the commercial space launch business, which could undermine ULA's push to secure more commercial launches.ULA and Air Force officials began pressing for a waiver after Senator John McCain, the powerful head of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and others rejected calls by Air Force officials to modify the existing law.

610,"  (Adds detail)By Andrea ShalalPARIS, June 14 Engine maker Pratt & Whitney said on Sunday it was ""very comfortable"" with progress on the F135 engine it builds for the Lockheed Martin Corp F-35 fighter jet, and expected to drive costs down further in the next two batches of engines.Mark Buongiorno, who heads Pratt's work on the F135 engine, said the company had submitted proposals for ninth and 10th low-rate production contracts, and hoped to reach agreement with the Pentagon before the end of the year. Pratt, a unit of United Technologies Corp, has already delivered 228 engines to the government, and the next two batches will add 160 engines.""We think the F-35 is in a very good place,"" Buongiorno told Reuters in an interview ahead of the June 15-21 Paris Airshow. ""We're feeling very comfortable with where the program is coming out of development."" He said six F-35 B-model jets, which take off from shorter runways and can land like a helicopter, had aced testing on the USS Wasp last month without requiring any major engine repairs.He said Pratt had already delivered more than 10 engines required for the U.S. Marine Corps to be able to declare the new jet ready for combat use. The Marines are expect to issue the declaration next month after a rigorous readiness inspection. Bennett Croswell, head of military engines for Pratt, said the F135 engines were achieving a mission readiness rate of 90 percent now, four years ahead of the target to hit that goal.Buongiorno and Croswell declined to give details about the extent of expected cost savings on the next two contracts, but said a 7.5 percent drop from sixth to eighth low-rate production contracts was a good indicator of the type of savings being achieved. Buongiorno said the company was meeting targets it set in 2009 for lowering the cost the engines but had no immediate details on the specific anticipated savings.He said Pratt recently completed full-life capability testing of one of the engines built as part of the sixth production batch, completing 5,200 cycles, or the equivalent of more than 1,200 F-35 missions or seven years of operation.He said Pratt was streamlining its own operations and working closely with its suppliers to ensure they were ready for the coming ramp in production, and to drive the cost of the engines further down. About 70 percent of the content on the F135 engine is produced by suppliers.The company said it had already built 21 F135 engines at a second facility it opened in West Palm Beach, Florida, to ensure a smooth transition to higher production rates.

611,"   By Andrea Shalal | PARIS, June 15  PARIS, June 15 Lockheed Martin Corp, maker of the F-35 fighter jet, said on Monday it realized it would have to generate significant savings to help justify a block buy of up to 500 aircraft beginning in fiscal 2018.Lorraine Martin, Lockheed's F-35 program manager, said her company and others involved in the program were working hard to identify ways to further drive down the cost of the $391 billion weapons program and shore up support for a multi-year purchase.U.S. lawmakers, who would need to approve any multi-year procurement deal, usually expect savings of around 10 percent to back such deals. ""We've got to have significant savings to make the commitment worthwhile to them,"" Martin said after a briefing at the 2015 Paris Airshow. ""We're working with all of the industrial base right now to figure out every trick, tool and capability to help take cost out.""Martin said longer-running procurement deals provided a more stable outlook for Lockheed and the huge number of suppliers that provide components for the F-35 jets, making it easier for even tiny suppliers to invest in new tooling or other ways to lower costs. Martin said Lockheed was due to provide an estimate of the likely cost savings to the Pentagon by the end of the summer. She said Lockheed supported the Pentagon's push given the certainty of a block buy, the sheer scale of the resulting order, and the ability to drive down costs by ordering larger quantities of titanium and other materials.Martin said a block buy could include 460 aircraft, although the number could rise to around 500 new aircraft if Canada and Denmark decided to place orders.The Pentagon's chief arms buyer, Frank Kendall, last month said the Defense Department was hoping to conclude a multi-year agreement that would cover purchases by the U.S. military and other countries involved in the program.

Northrop and Boeing Co have also said they plan to compete for the contract when the Air Force launches a competition in the coming years.The head of Lockheed's aeronautics division, Orlando Carvalho, told Reuters the project would be led by Lockheed's Skunkworks research and development shop and would feature an open architecture that would allow the government to own the technical baseline for future upgrades. Lockheed will serve as the main integrator for the project, while Raytheon will bring its expertise with various surveillance sensors, mission systems integration, and JSTARS communications.Bombardier will provide its ultra-long-range Global business jet, which Lockheed said is less expensive to operate than modern airliners and requires less refueling. ""We plan to bring all this technology and expertise together to offer what we believe will be a very competitive solution,"" Carvalho said.Lockheed said the teaming agreement matched the U.S. government's desire for strong industry partnerships and would give the Air Force superior capabilities.Carvalho said it was the first time that Lockheed had teamed up to pursue a major program with Bombardier. The Air Force already uses the Bombardier Global as the basis for its  Battlefield Airborne Communications Node, or BACN program.

619,"  (Adds Lockheed statement)By Andrea ShalalPARIS, June 17 The top U.S. Marine in charge of aviation is ""very confident"" about the $391 billion Lockheed Martin Corp F-35 fighter program ahead of a decision on the jet's combat-readiness, but said he is keeping ""a careful eye"" on the spare parts supply.Lieutenant General Jon Davis, deputy commandant for aviation, said on Tuesday the 10 jets in an initial squadron had  completed retrofits and were being repainted. Only a few items had to be checked off before the Marine Corps kicks off in mid-July a tough operational readiness review of the first F-35 squadron that could be sent into combat.The Marines would be the first military service to declare the new jets ready for combat use. ""I believe that we'll be OK, but I want to take a look if we are short on spare parts,"" Davis said in an interview at the Paris Airshow. ""I know we're going to need more than we have. I think there's risk there, and I wanted to lay out exactly what that risk is.""He said Congress had curtailed funding for F-35 spare parts in recent budgets, and he would likely need to request extra funds to avoid potential issues with the readiness of the aircraft if they had to be deployed overseas. Lockheed spokesman Michael Rein said the company was working closely with the Marines to ensure the service had ""everything it needs,"" including sufficient spare parts.Davis said he would not approve declaration of an ""initial operational capability"" unless the unit was ready. The readiness review would cover 134 items, including rigorous flight and simulator tests for pilots, random maintenance tests, and landings on land-based pads near the air base in Yuma, Arizona, he said.If the first F-35 squadron passes its review next month, officials could send it overseas to drop laser-guided bombs, provide close-air support and carry out other missions.Orlando Carvalho, who heads Lockheed's aeronautics division, said in an interview that Marine Corps action would be a ""huge milestone"" for the program that marked its transition to a real operational military asset.Carvalho said Lockheed had finished writing the 3F software that would mark the end of the jet's development program, and was starting to test and integrate the new code.

622,"   By Andrea Shalal and Mike Stone | WASHINGTON/NEW YORK  WASHINGTON/NEW YORK Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) and Textron Inc (TXT.N) have emerged as final contenders to buy United Technologies Corp's  (UTX.N) Sikorsky Aircraft business, which could be valued at around $8 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.UTC is weighing offers from the two companies and may come to a decision by the end of the month, one of the people said. The company could still decide against an outright sale and instead spin off Sikorsky to shareholders in a tax-free deal, the people added, asking not to be named because the matter is not public.Last month, UTC announced it was exiting the helicopter business and would either sell or spin off Sikorsky, which has come under pressure in the commercial market, where lower energy prices have slashed demand from the oil and gas sector.Textron, which has a market capitalization of about $12 billion and is up against a much larger suitor, has reached out to private equity firms to put together a cash bid for Sikorsky, the people said. Lockheed Martin has a market value of about $60 billion. Textron, maker of Bell helicopters and Cessna aircraft, had initially proposed a Reverse Morris Trust (RMT) merger between Sikorsky and Textron, a transaction that allows a parent company to sell its subsidiary while avoiding a hefty tax bill, Reuters previously reported.UTC made clear it was not interested in acquiring a stake in Textron as part of the more complex transaction, the sources said. People familiar with the process had said that arrangement would have had substantial tax savings.Textron then reached out private equity firms for help to make a cash offer, the sources said. Boeing Co (BA.N), which had expressed interest in a potential deal, is no longer active in the sale process, the sources said. Airbus Group SE (AIR.PA), the world's largest civil helicopter maker which has said it is keeping an eye on the fate of Sikorsky, is not in the race to acquire it, another source familiar with the situation said.Representatives for UTC, Lockheed, Textron, Boeing and Airbus declined comment.Analysts have focused on Textron as the likeliest buyer, given its interest in beefing up its existing Bell Helicopter business. But industry executives said there could be antitrust questions on the commercial side, given that both companies make helicopters in similar market segments. For Lockheed, acquiring Sikorsky would be the first major acquisition for Chief Executive Marillyn Hewson, who has helped nearly double the company's share price since taking over as CEO in January 2013.Sikorsky is seen as a ""signature company"" that could help Lockheed produce strong revenues in the medium term, when production of the F-35 fighter jet program begins to taper off, said one of the sources. ""It would certainly help Lockheed diversify its portfolio,"" said one of the sources.Lockheed and Sikorsky already work together on several major helicopter programs, including the presidential helicopter, a combat rescue helicopter and the MH-60R- and S-model helicopters built for the Navy and Marine Corps.

624,"   By Lewis Krauskopf | July 9  July 9 As United Technologies Corp nears a decision on how it will divest its Sikorsky helicopter division, the U.S. conglomerate faces challenges to its financial outlook that may limit the lift to its stock in the near term.UTC shares have declined 5 percent this year, hurt by the  global economic jitters that have spooked shareholders of many multinational manufacturers, investors and analysts said on Thursday. Stock market upheaval in China and stalled sales at some of its businesses also darken the horizon.""As long as there's economic weakness outside the U.S., which doesn't seem to be lifting anytime soon, it's going to be one of those stocks that suffers,"" said Keith Davis, principal at investment management firm Farr, Miller & Washington, which holds about 250,000 UTC shares.UTC has twice trimmed its 2015 profit forecast this year, and recently signaled further pressure. In an analyst meeting last month, it pointed to weak equipment order trends at its Otis elevators business, which accounts for about one-fourth of its operating profit and is dependent on China. Since then, the Chinese stock market rout has heightened concern about the country's economy. China has been expected to account for about two-thirds of all new elevator sales this year, analysts at William Blair said this week.Also, UTC said last month its UTAS aircraft components and systems unit would not hit sales growth targets in the commercial aftermarket business. ""It's hard to see a real catalyst"" for the stock, said Chip Pettengill, portfolio manager at Bahl & Gaynor Investment Counsel, which holds more than 520,000 shares. ""The stock is probably going to be stuck for a while.""Following UTC's June announcement that it would split off Sikorsky, Reuters reported on Wednesday that Lockheed Martin Corp and Textron Inc have emerged as final contenders to buy it, with a decision possible by month's end.  UTC, however, could decide instead to spin Sikorsky off. While a strong sale price might boost the stock, benefits from the divestment are now largely incorporated into the shares, Pettengill said.New Chief Executive Greg Hayes, who was elevated to his post in November and subsequently initiated the Sikorsky strategic review, has said he is interested in large acquisitions but that expensive valuations have undercut his desires.How the company decides to use its cash ""continues to be a focus of investors,"" said Sterne Agee CRT analyst Peter Arment.Pettengill advocates using some to buy back shares.

627,"  WASHINGTON The U.S. government on Wednesday said it had approved Lockheed Martin Corp to upgrade 134 U.S.-made F-16 jet fighters for South Korea with new mission computers, radars and other equipment in a deal worth an estimated $2.5 billion.South Korea initially chose the U.S. unit of Britain's BAE Systems Plc to do the upgrades, but canceled the deal in November 2014 after a spike in the projected $1.7 billion cost.The Pentagon's Defense Security Cooperation Agency said the State Department had notified Congress on Tuesday that it had approved the potential foreign military sale to South Korea with Lockheed and Northrop Grumman Corp as key contractors.Lawmakers now have 30 days to block the possible sale, although such action is rare. South Korea is looking to upgrade 134 Lockheed-built F-16 fighter jets to include modular mission computers, scanned array radar, friend or foe identification systems, navigation systems and radar warning systems, among other items, the agency said.Seoul also has asked to purchase a number of precision weapons, including laser-guided bombs and bomb tail kits. It also is seeking training weapons, and U.S. government and contractor technical support. BAE Systems and South Korea remain locked in a legal battle over Seoul's decision to cancel its earlier contract with BAE.Seoul has sued BAE in South Korean court to collect $43 million involved in a bid guarantee on the program. BAE, in a lawsuit filed in the United States, has said it does not believe it owes Seoul any money for the canceled upgrade program.

628,"  (Recasts with approval; adds details on approval, background on canceled deal with BAE )WASHINGTON, July 15 The U.S. government on Wednesday said it had approved Lockheed Martin Corp to upgrade 134 U.S.-made F-16 jet fighters for South Korea with new mission computers, radars and other equipment in a deal worth an estimated $2.5 billion.South Korea initially chose the U.S. unit of Britain's BAE Systems Plc to do the upgrades, but canceled the deal in November 2014 after a spike in the projected $1.7 billion cost.The Pentagon's Defense Security Cooperation Agency said the State Department had notified Congress on Tuesday that it had approved the potential foreign military sale to South Korea with Lockheed and Northrop Grumman Corp as key contractors. Lawmakers now have 30 days to block the possible sale, although such action is rare.South Korea is looking to upgrade 134 Lockheed-built F-16 fighter jets to include modular mission computers, scanned array radar, friend or foe identification systems, navigation systems and radar warning systems, among other items, the agency said. Seoul also has asked to purchase a number of precision weapons, including laser-guided bombs and bomb tail kits. It also is seeking training weapons, and U.S. government and contractor technical support. BAE Systems and South Korea remain locked in a legal battle over Seoul's decision to cancel its earlier contract with BAE.Seoul has sued BAE in South Korean court to collect $43 million involved in a bid guarantee on the program.BAE, in a lawsuit filed in the United States, has said it does not believe it owes Seoul any money for the canceled upgrade program. Company executives say the ""bid bond"" was never paid since the terms of the initial contract were changed to be a foreign military sale negotiated among the governments.

629,"   By Andrea Shalal and Lewis Krauskopf | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) has agreed to buy United Technologies Corp's (UTX.N) Sikorsky Aircraft for over $8 billion, two sources said on Sunday, cementing a deal that would confirm Lockheed's dominance in weapons making and giving the Black Hawk helicopter to the maker of the F-35 fighter jet.The deal will add further heft to Lockheed, which already has annual revenues of around $45 billion and dwarves its nearest competitors, the defense business of Boeing Co (BA.N) and Northrop Grumman Corp (NOC.N).It will make Lockheed less reliant on the $391 billion F-35 fighter jet business, while expanding its overseas sales by adding Sikorsky's iconic Black Hawk helicopters to a product line that already spans everything from satellites to naval ships.The two companies plan to announce the deal on Monday before both report second-quarter results on Tuesday, said the sources, who were not authorized to speak publicly.It will be Lockheed's largest acquisition since it bought Martin Marietta Corp for about $10 billion two decades ago. It is the first major strategic move for both United Tech Chief Executive Officer Greg Hayes, who was elevated to CEO from finance chief in November, and Lockheed CEO Marillyn Hewson, who took her job in January 2013.United Technologies and Lockheed officials declined comment. Textron Inc (TXT.N), parent of Bell Helicopter, had submitted a bid for Sikorsky, but dropped out of the bidding after the price rose, according to several sources familiar with the matter. Both helicopter makers have seen revenues drop due to lower demand from the oil and gas sector.Pentagon officials last week said they would carefully evaluate any sale of Sikorsky, saying it was important to the department to maintain competition and avoid market distortions.The U.S. Defense Department can object to a merger involving its key suppliers during a federal antitrust review, which in this case could be led by the U.S. Justice Department. Industry executives do not expect antitrust objections since Lockheed does not build helicopters, but said U.S. officials could ask for certain written assurances given Lockheed's expanded scale.""It's a big deal, but it doesn't concentrate markets any further than they already were,"" said Virginia-based defense consultant Loren Thompson. ""There's no real overlap between the fighter market and the rotorcraft market. They're discrete markets with different customers and users.""Lockheed is also looking to shed some of its lower-margin services businesses, which could help lower revenues in coming months, according to several sources familiar with the matter.Industry executives have long predicted further consolidation in the U.S. defense market after a massive contraction in the 1990s after the Cold War. The only sector that had remained largely unscathed was the helicopter market. Boeing, which makes CH-47 Chinook helicopters and works with Bell on the V-22, has already teamed up with Sikorsky to develop a next-generation helicopter for the U.S. military. UTC in March said it would explore alternatives for Sikorsky, which accounted for $7.5 billion in sales last year out of total UTC revenues of $65 billion. In June, it said it would exit the helicopter business and sell or spin off Sikorsky, which expects slower revenue growth and has lower profit margins than other UTC divisions.Sikorsky's fit with United Tech, which also makes Pratt & Whitney jet engines and Otis elevators, had been long debated on Wall Street. Sikorsky's first-quarter operating profit dropped 11 percent on a 7 percent fall in sales. In June, the unit announced 1,400 job cuts and said it would consolidate facilities.The price of the acquisition was inflated by a huge tax bill facing UTC since Sikorsky's value has appreciated so much since it became part of United Tech in 1929.UTC could use the funds for other large acquisitions, although the CEO has said the high valuations of targets have made potential transactions expensive. Lockheed decided to proceed with the deal, despite the hefty price tag, because it views Sikorsky as a ""signature company"" that will ensure strong revenues in the medium term, when F-35 production begins to taper off, according to two of the sources.Lockheed and Sikorsky already work together on several major helicopter programs, including the presidential helicopter, a combat rescue helicopter and the MH-60R- and S-model helicopters built for the Navy and Marine Corps.Sikorsky's strong foreign sales would help Lockheed expand its international footprint, said Richard Aboulafia, aerospace analyst with the Virginia-based Teal Group.""It's a great business for them to own. In addition to the F-35 and the C-130J, Sikorsky is another great brand for them to underpin their defense strategy,"" he said.Lockheed is keen to preserve the Sikorsky brand, the sources said, which means the company may well allow Sikorsky to continue functioning as a standalone business instead of integrating it into its already huge Aeronautics division, which had revenues of over $14 billion last year.Other big aerospace companies, including Italy's Finmeccanica SpA, Europe's Airbus and Textron Inc, allow their helicopter businesses to operate as separate units.

630,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Lockheed Martin Corp said Monday it would buy Black Hawk maker Sikorsky Aircraft from United Technologies Corp for $9 billion, cementing Lockheed's dominance in weapons making.Lockheed will also review the possible sale or spin off of $6 billion in other information technology and services businesses.The Pentagon's largest supplier called Sikorsky a ""national icon"" and said the net cost of the deal was around $7.1 billion, taking into account tax benefits. Lockheed also reported higher earnings and revenue for the second quarter.The deal, first reported by Reuters on Sunday, also opens key foreign markets for Lockheed, which has annual revenues of $45 billion. It already dwarves its nearest competitors, the defense business of Boeing Co and Northrop Grumman Corp.It comes just months after UTC said it would explore alternatives for Sikorsky, which it has owned since 1929 and which accounted for $7.5 billion in sales last year out of total UTC revenues of $65 billion.   This is Lockheed's largest acquisition since it bought Loral Corp's defense electronics business for $9.1 billion in 1996, and its $10 billion merger with Martin Marietta in 1994.It marks the first major strategic move for both United Tech CEO Greg Hayes, who was elevated from finance chief in November, and Lockheed CEO Marillyn Hewson, who took her job in January 2013.The two sides wrapped up key aspects of the deal late last week before Hewson jetted off to an annual UK air show, the Royal International Air Tattoo. Hewson returned in time for a telephone board meeting on Sunday evening that endorsed the deal, according to sources familiar with the process. The news buoyed Lockheed shares close to February record highs set. Shares were up 1.8 percent at $204.78; United Tech shares were about 0.4 percent lower at $110.30.""Sikorsky is a natural fit for Lockheed Martin and complements our broad portfolio of world-class aerospace and defense products and technologies,"" Hewson told analysts on an earnings call. She said the deal would give Lockheed access to a $30 billion annual military and commercial rotorcraft market, and said Lockheed expected Sikorsky's commercial helicopter business to recover from an oil-price related slump in coming years.Lockheed, which makes F-35 fighter jets, naval ships and government satellites, said it would continue to return cash to shareholders through dividends and to reduce outstanding share count to below 300 million shares by the end of 2017.  Democratic Representative Rosa DeLauro, who represents the Connecticut district where Sikorsky is based, said company President Bob Leduc assured her early Monday that Sikorsky would retain collective bargaining agreement and keep its name. Sikorsky has about 15,000 workers around the world.Pentagon officials had no immediate comment on the deal. Last week, they said they would carefully evaluate any sale of Sikorsky, saying it was important to maintain competition and avoid market distortions.The U.S. Defense Department can object to a merger involving key suppliers during a federal antitrust review, which in this case could be led by the U.S. Justice Department.Hewson said Pentagon officials planned a detailed review, but she did not expect major obstacles. Hewson said the deal would not reduce the number of competitors in the helicopter business, and Lockheed's plans to sell or spin off $6 billion in other businesses meant the company's overall size would not grow substantially.""Between those two elements, it is very positive,"" Hewson told analysts when asked about the Pentagon's initial reaction.Lockheed, advised on the acquisition by Credit Suisse and Fried Frank, said expects to close the Sikorsky transaction by late in the fourth quarter or early in 2016.Lockheed said it would complete a strategic review of its government IT infrastructure services business and the technical services business within its missiles and fire control segment by the end of the year, potentially affecting about 17,000 employees.The company said it would retain services businesses focused on defense and intelligence customers, including its extensive cybersecurity work for the U.S. government.UTC said proceeds from the Sikorsky sale would fund more share buybacks. Its board authorized a share buyback of up to 75 million shares, worth about $8.3 billion based on Friday's closing price.

Analysts and industry executives said they expected major consolidation moves in the services segment in coming months, given Lockheed's announcement and moves by other companies.But the company's decision to buy Sikorsky is unlikely to trigger a new wave of consolidation among prime contractors in the weapons market, which was already whittled down to five major players after the end of the Cold War in the 1990s.Jeff Bialos, a former senior U.S. defense official and partner with Sutherland, Asbill & Brennan, said there was no sign that the Pentagon has changed its policy to discourage hook-ups among first-tier or big prime contractors. He said he expected the Defense Department to conduct a thorough review of the Lockheed-Sikorsky deal, which would look at both the scale of the company post-acquisition, conflicts of interest, and any adverse impact on suppliers or competitors.Lockheed's agreement with UTC shows the company is bracing for possible divestments, including up to $650 million in parts of its mission systems and training business, according to the sales agreement with UTC. Sikorsky's X2 helicopter technology was exempted from potential divestments.The contract also spells out Lockheed's agreement to accept certain ""behaviorial limitations, conduct restrictions or similar commitments"" if required to do so by the government.   Bialos said there would be input from other companies and that a second 30-day review period was likely under a U.S. Department of Justice antitrust process.

640,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Lockheed Martin Corp's (LMT.N) decision to buy helicopter maker Sikorsky Aircraft and sell $6 billion in lower-margin units marks a clear turning point for Lockheed CEO Marillyn Hewson, who is shaking up the world's largest weapons maker.Thrust into the CEO job in January 2013 after retiring CEO Robert Stevens' designated successor was fired for having an affair with a subordinate, Hewson spent her first year largely executing a strategy Stevens had mapped out and repairing tense ties with the Pentagon on the $391 billion F-35 fighter program.Over the past 18 months, the seemingly mild-mannered engineer who is ranked No. 4 on Fortune's list of most powerful U.S. women executives, has grown more assertive, her power buoyed by a powerful share price rally that has earned her the respect of her board and key shareholders. Lockheed shares closed at $202.79 on Wednesday, not far off a historic high of $207 reached in February.""It's a great story. The accidental CEO steps in, doubles the share price, raises margins and then executes the biggest M&A deal the company has done in two decades,"" said one industry executive familiar with Hewson's career. ""But remember, the higher you aim, the greater the crash if things don't work out.""Indeed, the Sikorsky acquisition could test the 61-year-old executive's legacy of pleasing investors by running a tight ship. Industry executives said Hewson's track record of cutting costs - she pared the company's workforce by 8,000 people, or 6.7 percent, closed facilities and streamlined its structure - helped her convince Lockheed's generally conservative board to make a bet on the helicopter maker.That may not have been an easy call given a market downturn and uncertain outlook for near-term military sales. To seal the takeover of the unit that United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) unloaded because of its narrow margins, Lockheed agreed to pay a premium $9 billion for a company projecting revenues of just $6.5 billion. NOT WITHOUT RISKS A 30-year veteran of Lockheed, Hewson has focused on long-term investments, like ""over the horizon"" projects such as work on a portable fusion energy reactor, where she has channeled some savings from the recent cost cuts.In February, she told reporters that companies needed to ""see the big picture"" on challenges such climate change, energy and other national security threats. Her legacy and the future outlook of the Pentagon's biggest supplier will be shaped by Lockheed's ability to integrate Sikorsky, offload its services business, and keep key programs like the F-35 and Sikorsky's presidential helicopter on track.  Officials are also anxiously awaiting the outcome of two military competitions - a new Air Force bomber valued at over $80 billion for which Lockheed is teamed with Boeing Co (BA.N), and a multibillion-dollar ground vehicle competition to replace tens of thousands of military vehicles.""These deals are critical to helping her solidify her personal leadership since Lockheed has been heavily focused in recent years on share repurchases, dividends and turning F-35 around,"" said Jim McAleese, a Virginia-based defense consultant.Sikorsky is Lockheed's biggest takeover since it bought Loral Corp's defense electronics business for $9.1 billion in 1996, and is just shy of the $10 billion merger with Martin Marietta in 1994 that created the company as it stands today.An executive at another firm that looked at buying Sikorsky cautioned that the deal is not without risks, given the threat of further defense budget cuts, issues with several helicopter development programs, and overall cost of the deal. Lockheed would also face difficult contract negotiations in coming years with Sikorsky's unions. Still, Hewson was intent on adding another ""signature"" product line to help balance the company's portfolio, which is growing increasingly dependent on the F-35, according to sources familiar with the company. She had Sikorsky ""in her sights"" after her days working on the MH-60R and MH60S helicopters the two company co-produce for the Navy.Beyond the risks in Sikorsky, losing either one of the big weapons programs on the table would also be a big setback given how much the company has invested in both, analysts said.Executives who have worked closely with Hewson describe her as tough and detail-oriented, someone who demands a lot of herself and others around her. An early riser who dashes off emails well before dawn, Hewson is not someone prone to fly off the handle when something goes wrong, associates say.Married and the mother of two grown sons, Hewson promotes diversity programs within the company and writes a regular blog for networking site LinkedIn. She also often brings in writers like ""The Tipping Point"" author Malcolm Gladwell to explore new ideas and stimulate conversations with her leadership team.In a May LinkedIn posting, Hewson drew on her own experience to urge workers to push themselves beyond their comfort zone.""Don't limit yourself by doubting your ability to step up to a challenge ...

SSSI subcontracted another Sikorsky unit, Derco Aerospace, to procure spare parts. The government alleges that SSSI overbilled the Navy because Derco added profit and overhead costs to the price of the spare parts that it procured and sold to SSSI. United Tech had previously disclosed the allegations and that the U.S. government had filed a complaint in October.The company said it believes Derco was lawfully allowed to add profit and overhead to the cost of the parts.United Tech shares were off 1 percent at $100.10 on Friday morning.

Syring said the tests underscored the versatility of the latest version of the Aegis combat system built by Lockheed Martin Corp for use on Navy destroyers.The SM-6 missile intercepted a ballistic missile target in its final seconds of flight on July 28, followed by three more  tests over the next days. MDA fired two more SM-6 missiles in anti-air warfare roles to engage cruise missile targets and then an SM-2 Block IV missile against a ballistic missile threat. All the tests occurred at the Pacific Missile Range Facility in Kauai, Hawaii.The MDA said it would use the test results to improve and enhance the multilayered U.S. missile defense system, which defends against a range of ballistic missile threats in all phases of flight. Taylor Lawrence, president of Raytheon Missile Systems,  said the SM-6 missile offered the Navy greater flexibility to address a broad range of threats.""SM-6 is the only missile in the world that can do both anti-air warfare and ballistic missile defense from sea,""  Lawrence said in a statement.Raytheon said the SM-6 missile would be integrated into MDA's Sea-Based Terminal program on board U.S. Navy ships as part of the Aegis missile defense system, and was on track to be ready for combat use in 2016.Lockheed said the latest Aegis configuration for destroyers, called Baseline 9.C1, used commercial technologies and open architecture systems to merge ballistic missile defense and anti-air-warfare capabilities into an integrated system.

The contract calls for Lockheed to install the hardware and software needed for the combat system on board new Arleigh Burke-class destroyers and to modernize existing destroyers and cruisers to operate the latest version of Aegis, Baseline 9. The system allows ships to defend simultaneously against airborne threats, such as aircraft or cruise missiles, while also targeting and intercepting ballistic missiles, Lockheed said.

662,"  * Italy's Fincantieri invested $100 mln to expand shipyard* Cost of LCS ships coming down* Adopting techniques used in automotive, other sectors* Competition for next ship version could be worth billionsBy Andrea ShalalMARINETTE, Wis., Sept 6 Big investments, lean manufacturing techniques borrowed from the automotive industry, and a more engaged workforce have revamped the Wisconsin shipyard where Italy's Fincantieri SpA builds the Freedom variant of the U.S. Navy's coastal warships for prime contractor Lockheed Martin Corp.Fincantieri invested $100 million in recent years to transform the 1940s era shipyard into a state-of-the-art facility, where seven LCS ships are now under construction, including three that have already been launched into the river.Fincantieri and Lockheed hope to leverage the resulting savings in a multibillion-dollar U.S. Navy competition expected to kick off in late fiscal 2017 for 20 frigates, or upgraded versions of the current Littoral Combat Ships (LCS).The Navy plans to buy 32 of the current LCS models built by Lockheed and Australia's Austal Ltd. It is expected to decide in 2017 whether to keep ordering both models, or neck down to one provider. Jan Allman, who took over as president of Marinette Marine last year after nearly three decades in the automotive and truck business, walks the 550,000-square-foot (51,097-square-meter)shipyard every day, gathering tips from workers about how to improve production.Last month, Allman told Reuters, one worker told her she had saved hundreds of dollars a month by handing out only a small amount of titanium grease for workers' daily use, instead of a full $20 can that would be thrown away at the end of the day.""Every penny adds up,"" said Allman, who drew on her automotive industry experience to help draft new written guiding principles for the shipyard that emphasize continuous improvement, and urge workers to spend money as if it were their own.Lawmakers and watchdog groups have criticized early cost growth and technical challenges on the LCS ships, but Navy officials say costs have come down sharply, and the ships are performing well in early deployments in Asia and elsewhere. For instance, the Navy's last contract with Lockheed, for LCS 21, was priced at $362 million when it was awarded in April, compared with $537 million for the first of the steel monohull ships Lockheed built for the Navy.Lockheed is also eyeing foreign sales in coming years. Sources familiar with the talks told Reuters this week that the U.S. government was in advanced talks with the Saudi government about the sale of two Lockheed frigates in a deal worth well over $1 billion.Allman, who is pressing to meet aggressive internal cost targets, said she receives about 200 suggestions during small, quarterly meetings with nearly all 1,500 full-time employees at the yard, located about 55 miles (89 km) north of Green Bay.""She's down there with her steel-toed boots and hard hat,"" Rear Admiral Brian Antonio, the Navy's program executive officer for Littoral Combat Ships, told Reuters in a recent interview. ""We like what we see, from the way she's energizing her workforce. It makes a big difference in quality and the amount of rework because people are taking more pride in their job.""For instance, he said, the level of rework - components that must be redone due to quality problems - was halved from single-digit percentage levels on LCS 5 to LCS 9, the future USS Little Rock, which was launched into the Menominee River in July.He said the ship was also 80 percent complete when it launched, the highest level of completion seen on any LCS hull.Antonio said the Navy welcomed the improvements. ""The changes they've made to the shipyard ... will allow them to be more competitive as we move forward into the frigate.""Fincantieri's changes included paving the entire facility and doubling the indoor production space, including construction of a huge building where two of the 118-foot (36-meter) warships are now being assembled at once. It also streamlined the flow of raw materials and assembly functions to remove a full 8 miles from the production process of each ship.Other changes include higher rates of recycling, greater use of fixed assembly platforms, earlier installation of shipboard lighting rather than clamp-on lights, and more work assembling large modules on the ground, rather than on board the ships.Joe North, Lockheed's vice president of Littoral Ships and Systems, said the transformation reminds him of the scene in the movie ""The Wizard of Oz,"" when Dorothy's entire house lands squarely on the wicked witch.""If you look at the pictures, a new shipyard came down on top of the old one and brought with it a state-of-the-art capability,"" he said.

663,"  WASHINGTON, Sept 7 Italy's Lockheed Martin Corp  F-35 fighter jet completed its inaugural flight on Monday, marking the first-ever F-35 flight outside the United States and a major international milestone for the $391 billion weapons program, Lockheed said.Lockheed test pilot Bill Gigliotti completed a flight of nearly one-and-a-half hours in early afternoon European time on Monday, a key step toward planned delivery of the jet, known as AL-1, to the Italian government by the end of the year.Gigliotti said the flight went as planned, with no surprises.The jet was assembled at a final assembly and checkout plant, or FACO, in Cameri that is owned by the Italian government and managed by Finmeccanica SpA. ""Italy's 'primo volo' (first flight) sets a firm foundation for Italy's F-35 program and future opportunities for the Cameri FACO,"" said F-35 program manager Lorraine Martin. Italy's FACO facility began production in July 2013. It will assemble both Italy's F-35A conventional takeoff and landing model, as well as its F-35B model jets, which take off from shorter runways and land like a helicopter. It will also assemble F-35s for the Netherlands in coming years.Critics remain skeptical about the F-35 program, but U.S. officials say the massive weapons program has performed well in recent years after a large restructuring effort that added $6 billion to the plane's development effort. In July, the U.S. Marine Corps declared its first squadron of 10 F-35B jets ready for combat.The U.S. Air Force expects to follow suit in late 2018 or early August. Hill Air Force Base in Utah received its first two operational F-35A jets last week, a key step toward that declaration of initial operational capability.

Lockheed declined comment. No immediate comment was available from Boeing.ULA was created in 2005 after nearly two years of negotiations between the two companies, which overcome opposition from the Federal Trade Commission, arguing the venture would result in significant savings. The U.S. Air Force, eager to reintroduce competition to the market, has worked hard in recent years to certify a new competitor, Space Exploration Technologies Corp, or SpaceX, to launch certain military and spy satellites.The Air Force also plans to end certain launch support of about $1 billion a year that it had provided to ULA for years, now that another competitor is available.Aerojet Rocketdyne, which makes rocket engines, had hoped to  adapt its new AR-1 engine for use on ULA's Atlas 5 rocket, replacing the Russian-built RD-180 engine it now uses. But ULA's current plan is to use a new engine being developed by Blue Origin, owned by Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos.One of the sources said the ULA's owners might welcome the unsolicited bid, given increased competition from SpaceX that is likely to cut into ULA's revenues and earnings in coming years. Lockheed and Boeing, wary of declining revenue prospects,  have funded ULA's work on a new rocket only on a quarterly basis, given concerns about ULA's ability to use existing RD-180 engines for military and spy satellite launches.Congress banned the use of the Russian engines for such launches from 2019 after Russia's invasion of the Crimea region of Ukraine.

Big investments, lean manufacturing techniques borrowed from the automotive industry, and a more engaged workforce have revamped the Wisconsin shipyard where Italy's Fincantieri SpA (FCT.MI) builds the Freedom variant of the U.S. Navy's coastal warships for prime contractor Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N).Fincantieri invested $100 million in recent years to transform the 1940s era shipyard into a state-of-the-art facility, where seven LCS ships are now under construction, including three that have already been launched into the river.Fincantieri and Lockheed hope to leverage the resulting savings in a multibillion-dollar U.S. Navy competition expected to kick off in late fiscal 2017 for 20 frigates, or upgraded versions of the current Littoral Combat Ships (LCS). The Navy plans to buy 32 of the current LCS models built by Lockheed and Australia's Austal Ltd (ASB.AX). It is expected to decide in 2017 whether to keep ordering both models, or neck down to one provider.Jan Allman, who took over as president of Marinette Marine last year after nearly three decades in the automotive and truck business, walks the 550,000-square-foot (51,097-square-meter)shipyard every day, gathering tips from workers about how to improve production.Last month, Allman told Reuters, one worker told her she had saved hundreds of dollars a month by handing out only a small amount of titanium grease for workers' daily use, instead of a full $20 can that would be thrown away at the end of the day. ""Every penny adds up,"" said Allman, who drew on her automotive industry experience to help draft new written guiding principles for the shipyard that emphasize continuous improvement, and urge workers to spend money as if it were their own. Lawmakers and watchdog groups have criticized early cost growth and technical challenges on the LCS ships, but Navy officials say costs have come down sharply, and the ships are performing well in early deployments in Asia and elsewhere.For instance, the Navy's last contract with Lockheed, for LCS 21, was priced at $362 million when it was awarded in April, compared with $537 million for the first of the steel monohull ships Lockheed built for the Navy.Lockheed is also eyeing foreign sales in coming years. Sources familiar with the talks told Reuters this week that the U.S. government was in advanced talks with the Saudi government about the sale of two Lockheed frigates in a deal worth well over $1 billion.Allman, who is pressing to meet aggressive internal cost targets, said she receives about 200 suggestions during small, quarterly meetings with nearly all 1,500 full-time employees at the yard, located about 55 miles (89 km) north of Green Bay. ""She’s down there with her steel-toed boots and hard hat,"" Rear Admiral Brian Antonio, the Navy's program executive officer for Littoral Combat Ships, told Reuters in a recent interview.""We like what we see, from the way she’s energizing her workforce.

678,"   By Irene Klotz | CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla  CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla (Reuters) – - United Launch Alliance (ULA), the biggest supplier of rockets for the U.S. military, will ramp up rocket engine work with Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) founder Jeff Bezos' space company, the companies said on Thursday.The move comes as ULA, a partnership of Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) and Boeing Co (BA.N), is considering a $2 billion cash buyout offer from Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings (AJRD.N), sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.Aerojet also is developing an alternative engine for ULA's next-generation rocket, called Vulcan.ULA and Bezos' space company, Blue Origin, said last year the companies would jointly develop a liquid natural gas-fueled rocket engine to replace the Russian-made RD-180 engines that currently power ULA's workhorse Atlas 5 booster.  ULA can no longer import the Russian engines for U.S. military launches, the bulk of its business, under a congressional ban enacted in response to Russia's involvement in Ukraine. Aerojet is working on another engine, called the AR1, though its development is at least 16 months behind Blue Origin's BE-4, ULA Chief Executive Tory Bruno said at a congressional hearing in June. ULA has a contract with Aerojet to use the AR1 as a backup if Blue Origin's development program stumbles.  ULA, Lockheed, Boeing and Aerojet have declined to comment about the reported buyout offer. However, on Thursday ULA and Blue Origin said they had agreed to expand the production capabilities of the BE-4, which is targeted to make its debut flight in 2019. ""This new agreement is an important step toward building BE-4s at the production rate needed for the Vulcan launch vehicle,"" Bezos said in a statement. Bezos is scheduled to be in Florida on Tuesday to unveil plans for its own rocket manufacturing plant and launch pad at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, located just south of NASA's Kennedy Space Center. Blue Origin intends to use the BE-4 engine in its rockets as well as sell them to ULA and potentially other customers.

Sept 10 - United Launch Alliance (ULA), the biggest supplier of rockets for the U.S. military, will ramp up rocket engine work with Amazon.com Inc  founder Jeff Bezos' space company, the companies said on Thursday.The move comes as ULA, a partnership of Lockheed Martin Corp  and Boeing Co, is considering a $2 billion cash buyout offer from Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.Aerojet also is developing an alternative engine for ULA's next-generation rocket, called Vulcan.ULA and Bezos' space company, Blue Origin, said last year the companies would jointly develop a liquid natural gas-fueled rocket engine to replace the Russian-made RD-180 engines that currently power ULA's workhorse Atlas 5 booster. ULA can no longer import the Russian engines for U.S. military launches, the bulk of its business, under a congressional ban enacted in response to Russia's involvement in Ukraine.Aerojet is working on another engine, called the AR1, though its development is at least 16 months behind Blue Origin's BE-4, ULA Chief Executive Tory Bruno said at a congressional hearing in June. ULA has a contract with Aerojet to use the AR1 as a backup if Blue Origin's development program stumbles.ULA, Lockheed, Boeing and Aerojet have declined to comment about the reported buyout offer. However, on Thursday ULA and Blue Origin said they had agreed to expand the production capabilities of the BE-4, which is targeted to make its debut flight in 2019.""This new agreement is an important step toward building BE-4s at the production rate needed for the Vulcan launch vehicle,"" Bezos said in a statement.Bezos is scheduled to be in Florida on Tuesday to unveil plans for its own rocket manufacturing plant and launch pad at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, located just south of NASA's Kennedy Space Center. Blue Origin intends to use the BE-4 engine in its rockets as well as sell them to ULA and potentially other customers.

680,"  (Adds background, further comment from Army)WASHINGTON, Sept 11 The U.S. Army on Friday said it had issued a stop-work order to Oshkosh Corp on a contract valued at up to $6.75 billion for 17,000 new armored trucks, following a protest filed against the contract award this week by Lockheed Martin Corp.Army spokesman Michael Clow said the stop-work order, or ""stay of contract performance,"" was required under federal procurement law. Lockheed on Tuesday said it filed a formal protest against the Oshkosh contract with the Government Accountability Office, which must rule on the case by Dec. 17. The other losing bidder, privately-held AM General, which built the U.S. military's original Humvees, did not file a protest. Clow said the Army remained confident that the new Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV) to be built by Oshkosh would provide soldiers and marines a substantial capability improvement at an affordable price.

But on a conference call Wednesday, NASA Associate Administrator Robert Lightfoot told reporters the agency had lost confidence in that date.Given technical, financial and management hurdles the capsule will face during development, he said an April 2023 launch date now seemed more likely.NASA plans to spend another $6.77 billion between October 2015 and April 2023 for two of the new Orion capsules, which are currently under development by lead contractor Lockheed Martin Corp. The agency has already has paid $4.7 billion for Orion design and development, Lightfoot said.He said an unmanned Orion was still scheduled for liftoff in December 2018, carried aloft by a Space Launch System (SLS) rocket that is the focus of a separate $7 billion development effort.

689,"   By Andrea Shalal | NATIONAL HARBOR, Md.  NATIONAL HARBOR, Md. Long delays in Lockheed Martin Corp's development of a computer-based logistics system for the F-35 fighter jet pose the biggest threat to the U.S. Air Force's plan to declare the aircraft ready for combat next summer, the head of the Pentagon's F-35 program office said.""It's the thing that worries me most,"" Air Force Lieutenant General Chris Bogdan said in an interview at the annual Air Force Association conference. ""We're on a full court press with ALIS,"" the Autonomic Logistics Information System.ALIS will consolidate all functions handled separately on older aircraft programs. These include automatically capturing and disseminating data about the F-35's performance and components, pilot and technician training, scheduling, technical data, and the ordering of parts.Bogdan said his office had been working closely with Lockheed to ensure the company was putting its ""A-team"" on the project after years of delays and missed deadlines.""We're going to need it. When we start putting airplanes overseas, the expectation is that our partners will use ALIS and it has to connect to their legacy systems. It's really hard and it's not working right,"" he said late Tuesday. Israel is slated to get its first jets in December 2016.Bogdan applauded plans by Lockheed to make organizational changes to improve its performance on ALIS, and said he still hoped the new software would be completed in time for the Air Force to declare an initial squadron of jets ready for combat in August 2016. U.S. officials say the overall $391 billion F-35 program has turned the corner after years of cost and technical challenges, with production set to increase and costs coming down. Lockheed is developing three models of the jet for three U.S. military services and nine countries that have placed orders: Britain, Australia, Norway, Italy, the Netherlands, Turkey, Israel, Japan and South Korea.But the ambitious ALIS system, a project with nearly as many lines of software code as the aircraft, continues to challenge the jet's developers. Lockheed says each F-35 jet will have more than 8 million lines of code, more than any other U.S. or allied jet in history. The system has faced long delays and faulty messages caused by insufficient data about the lifespan of key parts, such as landing gear. Unexpected glitches also occurred when the system was plugged into congested computer networks at military bases.Bogdan said the key problem was that ALIS was initially viewed as a piece of support equipment, instead of an integral computer backbone for the jet, and Lockheed did not apply the same engineering ""discipline"" it had in designing the jet.He said Lockheed was paying closer attention after several missed ALIS deadlines cost it award fees on the overall program.  He said the Pentagon and Lockheed were not looking at removing planned capabilities from the system, but could likely defer upgrades planned after 2018 to focus on ""really trying to get the basic capability to work as best we can.""Lockheed said its work on the latest version of ALIS, known as ALIS 2.0.2, was on track for on-time delivery, and two earlier releases were fielded on time.""We are working closely with our customers to deliver the most effective, efficient fleet management system to sustain the F-35 over the next 50 years,"" said spokeswoman Sharon Parsley.The new software will add data about the F135 engine built by Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp, and a networking feature to more easily establish connections between deployed locations and home stations.

I think we will win. That is my view,"" Buskhe said of the competition, speaking to Reuters at a London defence exhibition.""If we don't win, we have learned a lot of other things and we have shown it is possible to work together and have created a culture between Boeing and Saab (such) that we could do more things together."" Despite being rival fighter manufacturers, Boeing and Saab already co-operate in adapting an air weapon for ground forces.In 2013, they agreed to develop a new plane to try to win the U.S. order for 350 trainers. The U.S. Air Force plans to launch that competition formally in 2017 and analysts say it could eventually buy up to 600 planes.The design of the Boeing-Saab proposal has been one of the industry's closest secrets, but Boeing offered a glimpse at an Air Force Association event in Washington this week. A teaser graphic showed a long and slender nose section and partial cockpit, with no engine inlets or wings in sight.Experts said that indicated the aircraft may be larger and more ambitious than traditional trainers such as Britain's popular Hawk, whose wings and engines sit close behind the pilot.Northrop Grumman Corp, builder of the current T-38,  had originally teamed up with Britain's BAE Systems to offer the Hawk, but tightened the contest earlier this year by announcing it had switched to an all-new model. Also offering a clean-sheet design is Textron Inc.Lockheed Martin has partnered with Korean Aerospace Industries to offer the South Korean T-50.Italy's Finmeccanica, recently abandoned by U.S. partner General Dynamics in a bid to offer a jet based on the Italian M-346 trainer, is looking for a new U.S. partner, executives said at the DSEI defence event in London.Defense News quoted U.S. Air Force officials as saying U.S. contractor Raytheon was discussing the possibility of taking over as the lead partner for Finmeccanica's aircraft.

696,"  (Adds Aerojet comment)By Andrea ShalalFORT WORTH, Texas, Sept 22 United Launch Alliance, a joint venture of Lockheed Martin Corp  and Boeing Co, on Tuesday said it had selected Orbital ATK  as the sole provider of solid rocket motors for its Atlas V and Vulcan launch vehicles from 2019.The news spells a serious setback for rival engine maker Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings Inc, which currently supplies solid rocket motors to ULA for the Atlas rocket. Industry sources said the decision could force Aerojet to re-evaluate the future of the large Sacramento facility where it builds the motors, particularly if it loses out on other orders.It follows Boeing's announcement last week that ULA's owners had rejected a $2 billion cash bid by Aerojet to take over ULA. Aerojet spokesman Glenn Mahone said the company would keep supplying solid rocket motors to ULA until 2019, and would aggressively go after a contract to replace the U.S. Air Force's intercontinental ballistic missiles, as well as potential commercial orders.""We remain committed to our solid rocket business which provides very competitive and reliable products to the marketplace,"" Mahone said.ULA said it had agreed to a ""long-term strategic partnership"" with Orbital ATK, and said the company would be the only provider of solid rocket boosters for ULA's Atlas V and Vulcan launch vehicles, effective in 2019. ""As ULA transforms the space lift industry, strong partners such as Orbital ATK are critical to reducing cost, introducing cutting-edge innovation and continuing our focus on mission success,"" Tory Bruno, ULA president and chief executive officer said in a statement.Under this partnership, Orbital ATK is investing in the design, development and qualification of two new rocket motors with design similarities, ULA said. It said the motors would help to significantly lower the price of the motors. ULA said the new solid rocket boosters would be introduced on ULA's Atlas V vehicle in late 2018 and on ULA's new Vulcan vehicle in mid-2019.Orbital ATK already supplies composite structures, nozzles, propellant tanks and booster separation motors for the current versions of Delta IV and Atlas V rockets.In addition, ULA will supply two Atlas rockets to provide launch services for Orbital ATK's Cygnus spacecraft on cargo delivery missions to the International Space Station for NASA in late 2015 and early 2016.Orbital ATK is also developing a fully integrated third stage to launch NASA's Solar Probe Plus mission on ULA's Delta IV Heavy rocket in 2018.

U.S. defense officials are in separate talks with Lockheed for the aircraft, and Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp, for the jet's F135 engines.The department in November 2014 awarded Lockheed a contract valued at $4.7 billion for an eighth batch of F-35 fighter jets, a 43-jet deal that lowered the average price per jet by 3.5 percent from the last contract.The government signed a separate contract valued at $1.05 billion for an eighth batch of engines built by Pratt & Whitney. U.S. Air Force Lieutenant General Chris Bogdan said the failure of Congress to pass a budget for fiscal 2016, which begins Oct. 1, could result in a long-term resolution continuing spending at last year's levels, which would trim the Pentagon's planned F-35 purchase by 19 jets, 16 A-model jets and 3 B-model jets.""Those airplanes are moving down the production line today, so if we’re not able to buy them in FY16, we'll have to do something to ensure that those airplanes eventually get bought,"" he said. Kendall said a long-term continuing resolution would have a ""very negative effect"" on the F-35 program, which is just preparing for a major ramp up in production that the department is counting on to lower the cost of the new aircraft.He said the department was looking at whether to hold off making some of the major commitments it planned in fiscal 2016 until the congressional budget issue was resolved.

701,"   By Andrea Shalal | FORT WORTH, Texas  FORT WORTH, Texas The U.S. Navy's next round of carrier testing of the Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) F-35C stealth fighter jet will include new helmets and jets fully loaded with internal weapons, a company official told Reuters.During the tests, scheduled for the first two weeks of October, two F-35s will also test the Joint Precision Approach and Landing System (JPALS), an all-weather, GPS-guided landing system being designed by Raytheon Co (RTN.N), Lockheed's F-35 program manager, Lorraine Martin, said in an interview. She spoke after a ceremony for the rollout of the first of the 52 F-35s that Norway will buy.Martin said the second round of testing is a milestone for the jet, which has wider wings than Air Force and Marine Corps versions, holds more fuel, and is designed to be catapulted off the deck of an aircraft carrier, and then land, using a special hook and heavy arresting gear.""We're really pleased with the momentum that we've got with the Navy,"" she said. ""If you talk to the Navy's aviators, they know the aircraft has incredible importance for their ability to do what they need to do from the ship around the world.""Lockheed is building three models of the supersonic jet for the U.S. military and nine other countries: Britain, Australia, Norway, Italy, Turkey, the Netherlands, Israel, Japan and South Korea. Denmark and Canada are also considering orders. The Pentagon plans to spend $391 billion to develop and produce 2,457 planes over the next few decades.Total procurement is now slated to reach 3,150, but could rise, Martin told reporters this week. She said the U.S. government is providing information about the aircraft to other countries, identified by sources familiar with the program as Singapore, Belgium, Switzerland, Poland, Finland and Spain. The U.S. Marine Corps in July became the first service to declare an initial squadron of its F-35B jets ready for combat, with the Air Force due to follow suit next August.The U.S. Navy, which carried out the first round of at-sea testing on the USS Nimitz last November, plans to have an initial squadron of jets ready for combat by late 2018 or early 2019.Martin said the jets' performance during the first round of carrier testing had helped build confidence in the program. This time, one Lockheed and three government pilots will be using the jet's improved Generation-3 helmet, which is already being used for testing on land. They will fly with a full store of internal weapons and full fuel tanks to test the jet's performance at higher weights. There are no plans to fire the weapons, officials said.U.S. defense officials said the tests would also include catapult takeoffs with after-burner power, more night approaches and landings, engine runs for maintainers and other parameters aimed at creating conditions that are more similar to combat.They said the tests would not include a portable version of the F-35's complex, computer-based logistics system, with the data required to be relayed via communications links instead.

707,"  (Recasts to add Carter, Lockheed comments)By Andrea Shalal and Yeganeh TorbatiWASHINGTON, Sept 30 Pentagon officials warned on Wednesday against further consolidation in the U.S. weapons industry because fewer defense contractors could lead to higher costs, decreased innovation and less competition.U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter said he does not welcome further consolidation among large U.S. weapons makers. Carter was the Pentagon's chief arms buyer in 2011, when the department established a policy that discouraging mergers among large prime contractors, but opened the door to deals among smaller firms.""What I said then and still believe is that it was important to avoid excessive consolidation in the defense industry to the point where we did not have multiple vendors who could compete with one another on many programs,"" Carter told reporters.The comments came days after the U.S. Justice Department approved Lockheed Martin Corp's $9 billion acquisition of Sikorsky Aircraft, a unit of United Technologies Corp , one of the biggest acquisitions in the weapons industry in years. Lockheed expects to close the deal by the end of November or sooner, depending on when it wins regulatory approval from China and the European Union. ""Lockheed-Sikorsky doesn't mean open season on large prime-level mergers,"" said Jeff Bialos, a former senior Pentagon official who oversaw industry mergers and acquisitions.Dozens of companies in the sector merged in the 1990s as military spending fell sharply after the end of the Cold War. The changes left five large contractors that dominate the market: Lockheed, Boeing Co, Northrop Grumman Corp , General Dynamics Corp and Raytheon Co.Defense Undersecretary Frank Kendall told reporters the U.S. Justice Department had cleared the Lockheed-Sikorsky deal because there was no direct anti-competitive issue, but the department did not want to see its industrial base whittled down to two or three very large suppliers. He said the Pentagon would continue working with the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission to ensure mergers did not reduce competition. Defense officials also planned to meet with Congress to explore legal options to preserve the diversity and breadth of the U.S. defense industry.Kendall said the deal would strengthen Lockheed, the Pentagon's largest supplier, and further reduce the dwindling number of contractors bidding for weapons contracts. Future deals would be evaluated case-by-case, he said.""This transaction is the most significant change at the weapon system prime level since the large-scale consolidation that followed the end of the Cold War,"" he said. He said the deal would move a high percentage of the military helicopter market into a company that dominates the U.S. fighter jet market, due to a winner-take-all approach adopted over a decade ago for the F-35 fighter jet program.""With size comes power, and the department's experience with large defense contractors is that they are not hesitant to use this power for corporate advantage,"" he said.Lockheed fired back in a rare display of disagreement with its largest customer.""There is no evidence to support the view that larger defense companies reduce competition or inhibit innovation,"" Lockheed spokesman Dan Nelson said in statement.""We believe that defense contractors should continue to be assessed based on the performance and effectiveness of the products and solutions offered, not on the size of their company,"" he said.

710,"   By Irene Klotz | Cape Canaveral  Cape Canaveral Fla. Oct 1 A United Launch Alliance (ULA) Atlas 5 rocket is being prepared for a commercial satellite launch on Friday, a market the Lockheed Martin  and Boeing partnership has said it aims to grow to as its monopoly on U.S. military launches ends.ULA has four commercial launches on its 2016 schedule, including an Earth-imaging spacecraft for DigitalGlobe, a communications satellite for EchoStar Corp and a pair of space station cargo ships for Orbital ATK, the company said.The unmanned rocket scheduled to launch from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida will carry a communications satellite for Mexico. Launch is scheduled for at 6:08 a.m. EDT (1008 GMT) on Friday.The Morelos 3 satellite launch will be just the 12th time in 100 missions that ULA flies for a non-U.S. government customer, a review of the company's flight records showed. ULA's growing interest in the commercial satellite launch market comes as privately owned SpaceX is poised to break ULA's nine-year monopoly on the U.S. military's launch business.SpaceX has said the cost of a Falcon 9 rocket carrying a military satellite would be well under $100 million, about $280 million less than the average price the Air Force paid for a ULA launch in 2013, company founder and chief executive Elon Musk said at a congressional hearing in March. The ULA Atlas rocket most similar to a Falcon 9 costs $164 million under its latest Air Force contract, former chief executive Michael Gass told reporters in May.ULA and SpaceX are expected to go head-to-head for the first time in November bidding for the first of nine military satellite launches. So far, SpaceX is the only company besides ULA certified to fly military missions.ULA's non-military missions are exempt from a congressional ban on imports of the Atlas 5 rocket's Russian-made RD-180 engines.ULA and Air Force officials had urged lawmakers to relax the ban, enacted last year after Russia annexed the Crimea region of Ukraine, to bridge the gap until a new ULA rocket, built with U.S. engines, is ready to fly.U.S. lawmakers on Tuesday released a compromise version of the $612 billion defense authorization bill for fiscal 2016 that would allow ULA to use a total of nine more RD-180 engines to compete for military and spy satellite launch contracts using its Atlas 5 rockets.

711,"  WASHINGTON Oct 1 The Pentagon on Wednesday said it has restricted some lighter pilots from flying the Lockheed Martin Corp F-35 fighter jet while it works to address issues with ejection seats that could injure them during a low-speed ejection from the jets.Joe DellaVedova, spokesman for the Pentagon's F-35 program office, said pilots weighing less than 136 pounds (61.69 kg) were restricted from flying the jets from Aug. 27 given concerns about the seats made by UK-based Martin Baker Aircraft Corp.He said the restriction currently affected one of the 215 pilots already trained to fly the new stealthy, supersonic jets. The aircraft is designed to be flown by pilots weighing as little as 109 pounds (49.44 kg). The ban was put in place after tests discovered that the seat would rotate too far forward during a low-speed ejection by a lighter pilot, potentially causing injury to the back or neck, according to a defense official briefed on the issue.""The safety of our pilots is paramount and the F-35 Joint Program Office, Lockheed Martin, and Martin Baker continue to work this issue with the U.S. services and international partners to reach a solution as quickly as possible,"" DellaVedova said. He said the program was still in developmental testing, which is designed to identify such problems. Lockheed referred all questions to the F-35 program office.The issue was first reported by Defense News, a trade publication.

712,"   By Mike Stone  Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) is exploring merging some of its information technology and services businesses, with a value of about $4 billion, with another government services contractor, people familiar with the matter said on Friday.The contemplated transaction would create the largest government services contractor in the United States and would generate an estimated $2 billion windfall for Lockheed, the people said.Lockheed, the Pentagon's largest supplier, is looking to pay down debt following its agreement in July to acquire Sikorsky Aircraft, the helicopter unit of United Technologies Corp (UTX.N), for $9 billion in cash.CACI International Inc (CACI.N) and Science Applications International Corp (SAIC.N) are in early-stage talks with Lockheed about a so-called Reverse Morris Trust (RMT) deal for the assets, a transaction that would avert a hefty tax bill, the people said.Lockheed has also contacted other companies to determine their interest in a potential RMT deal, including Booz Allen Hamilton Holding Corp (BAH.N) and Leidos Holdings Inc (LDOS.N), the people added. The deal under discussion is part of a strategic review that Lockheed announced on July 20. The company said it would carry out a strategic review of government information technology and technical services businesses in two divisions with total estimated 2015 revenue of $6 billion, with the goal of spinning off the units or selling them to outside investors.The sources cautioned that there was no certainty that the RMT option would be chosen, and asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Lockheed, Booz Allen Hamilton and Leidos declined to comment, while CACI and Science Applications International did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Lockheed makes F-35 fighter jets, naval ships and government satellites. It has been expanding its weapons-making capabilities and moving away from more commoditized services. The programs being reviewed for sale or spinoff are mainly in Lockheed's information systems and government services business, but also include units in its missiles and fire-control division. The programs, which have more than 17,000 employees, have been struggling due to reduced government spending, increased competition and delays in new contracts. Bethesda, Maryland-based Lockheed has forecast sales at the information systems unit to decline in the mid-single digit percentage range in 2015. It plans to cut about 500 jobs there by mid-November.Last month, Lockheed said U.S. officials had approved its acquisition of Black Hawk helicopter maker Sikorsky.

Without the waiver, he said, ULA could not compete for that launch or any other new national security launches until an American-built engine is ready in 2019.""That's not a viable business model,"" he told reporters. Bruno said the company needed a decision to be able to submit a bid for the GPS launch competition, the first time in nearly a decade that launches of large U.S. military satellites will be opened to competition.Claire Leon, director of the Launch Enterprise Directorate at Air Force Space Command, said ULA has the option of formally requesting an RD-180 waiver as part of its bid.""It is critical to the Air Force that we get more than one bidder. We are actively working different ways to make it possible for ULA to bid,"" Leon told reporters on a conference call. ""We are hoping that they will bid on this proposal."" U.S. lawmakers banned use of the Russian engines for U.S. military and spy satellite launches last year after Russia's annexation of the Crimea region of Ukraine.The Air Force earlier this year approved privately held Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX, to compete for such launches against ULA, which has been the monopoly provider for most Air Force satellite launches since its creation in 2006.The Air Force issued final rules for the GPS 3 launch competition on Wednesday, and bids are due Nov. 16. ""Today I still have no engines to bid,"" Bruno told reporters after ULA's 100th consecutive successful launch, an unmanned Atlas 5 rocket carrying a Mexican communications satellite.The ban does not affect RD-180 engines used for NASA and commercial missions, but whenever ULA taps its current RD-180 inventory for non-military flights, it cannot order a replacement for later use on a military missions.Bruno said ULA is burning through its supply of RD-180 engines at a rate of one every four to six weeks.Bruno said the ban affected 24 of 29 engines that ULA had ordered from Russia, but not paid for, before Russia invaded Crimea. The five engines that could be used under the law had already been assigned to other missions and were not available for ULA to use in a bid for the GPS III launch, he said.Bruno said he was encouraged that U.S. lawmakers had allowed use of four more engines in a compromise version of the fiscal 2016 defense authorization bill.

718,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Oct 2 Orbital ATK Inc beat out Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings Inc to become the future sole supplier of solid rocket boosters for United Launch Alliance by offering better long-term pricing agreements, substantial cost reductions and more investment, ULA said Friday.Tory Bruno, chief executive officer of the 50-50 venture owned by Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing Co, said the deal with Orbital, announced last week, was one of many strategic agreements the company was forging with big suppliers to drive down costs and prepare for more competition.He told a teleconference that ULA would release more details soon and observers would be ""amazed"" to see the savings it was able to generate through agreements with ""the most expensive parts of our supply chain."" ULA announced on Sept. 22 that Orbital would provide all solid rocket motors for its Atlas 5 and Vulcan launch vehicles from 2019, dealing a serious blow to Aerojet, which currently builds those motors for the Atlas rocket.Bruno said ULA's decision to choose Orbital did not change the fundamental nature of its relationship with Aerojet, which still provides other components to ULA, including RL-10 motors that power the upper stages of the Atlas 5 and Delta 4 rockets. He said Orbital simply offered ULA a better deal in this case, including its willingness to invest in non-recurring items to help drive down its costs.Bruno categorically declined to discuss Aerojet's $2 billion cash offer for the company, which was rejected by ULA's owners earlier this month, or reports that Aerojet and ULA remain in discussions about a number of business arrangements. He said ULA saw continued progress on the BE-4 engine being developed by Blue Origin, owned by Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos, and the engine should enter full-scale testing next year. He said Aerojet was also making ""very good progress"" on its rival AR-1 engine, but it lagged the BE-4 program by 16 months.""They're a great company. They have awesome people. We continue to need them to build the rockets,"" Bruno said.Bruno also rejected concerns raised by some analysts that ULA was taking on too much risk by switching to Orbital as its solid rocket booster supplier, noting that the company already made large boosters for NASA, and accounted for 95 percent of the overall U.S. production of solid rocket boosters.

A waiver is allowed for national security reasons, but only if ""the space launch services and capabilities covered by the contract could not be obtained at a fair and reasonable price without the use of rocket engines designed or manufactured in the Russian Federation.""Musk said a waiver was unnecessary since SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket, and ULA's Delta rockets were also available.ULA has said it plans to discontinue production of all except the heaviest Delta 4 rockets because they are not and cannot ever be competitive with SpaceX's lower prices.

730,"   By Idrees Ali | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The pending takeover of United Technologies Corp’s Sikorsky Aircraft by Lockheed Martin Corp will not affect prototype work on an aircraft that will replace thousands of helicopters, U.S. Army acquisitions chief Heidi Shyu said on Tuesday. Last year one team from Boeing Co and Sikorsky and one team from Textron Inc’s Bell Helicopter were selected to build models of a multi-role vertical-lift aircraft as a part of the U.S. Army’s plan, the JMR technology demonstrator program, to replace aging helicopters. The future vertical life aircraft will replace up to 4,000 medium class UH-60 Black Hawk utility helicopters built by Sikorsky and Boeing's Apache attack helicopter.""No, it doesn't change it because I think what is important is you've got the Boeing-Sikorsky team competing against Bell,” Shyu told reporters at the annual Association of United States Army conference in Washington. “As far I know there's two separate teams,"" Shyu said.

McCain and other lawmakers say the system is not reliable enough. They want the Navy to look at alternatives before starting a series of operational tests that would pave the way to production.McCain said he expected the reviewers to ""fully explore"" concerns raised by Michael Gilmore, the Pentagon's director of operational test and evaluation. Gilmore said the Navy inflated operating time estimates for the Lockheed system by counting hours of analysis time when it was not in the water. In an August memorandum, Gilmore said the system was breaking down after every 18.8 to 25 hours of use, far short of the Navy's 75-hour requirement. Navy officials said they ordered the review of the RMS and its core Remote Multi-Mission Vehicle (RMMV) after its poor performance in a technical evaluation that ended Aug. 30.""While the RMS has demonstrated the ability to meet operational requirements, reliability performance has not been acceptable during the most recent technical evaluation,"" said Navy spokeswoman Captain Thurraya Kent.

""Alternatives would take up to five years and significant investment to ... achieve the performance demonstrated by RMS using RMMV today,"" Little said.Defense Undersecretary Frank Kendall assured McCain in a letter dated Oct. 8 that the department would not allow further production of the Lockheed vehicle until the review was completed in November.

Such approvals, which do not guarantee a deal will be reached, are followed by negotiations about an actual sale.Saudi Arabia, a key U.S. ally, is participating in coalition efforts to fight Islamic State militants in Syria, while also battling Iranian-allied Houthi rebels in Yemen, who have already fired Scud missiles against the kingdom. Saudi Arabia also remains concerned about the growing military strength of Iran.The PAC-3 missile defends against incoming aircraft and missiles, and it is currently used by the United States, the Netherlands, Germany, Japan, Taiwan and the United Arab Emirates, according to Lockheed. Joe Garland, vice president of business development for Lockheed's missiles and fire control division, told Reuters this week that Saudi Arabia would likely follow up with a purchase next year of the remaining 280 PAC-3 missiles in the agreement.He said the Gulf country was also looking to accelerate a likely purchase of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense anti-ballistic missile system known as THAAD, which is also built by Lockheed, and a deal could be reached in 2017. Lockheed officials had previously said they were upbeat  about the prospects of reaching a THAAD deal, but that it could take three to five years to reach a deal.The U.S. State Department declined comment. Garland said evolving threats in the region had prompted Saudi Arabia to ""look at the opportunity to accelerate"" that purchase.Riki Ellison, founder of the non-profit Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance, said the urgency of Saudi's missile defense purchases was driven by Scud missile launches from Yemen and Saudi Arabia's concerns about Iran.Separately, the U.S. government said on Wednesday it has approved the possible sale to Saudi Arabia of nine UH-60M Black Hawk helicopters built by Sikorsky Aircraft, a unit of United Technologies Corp, in a deal valued at $495 million.

743,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N), the Pentagon's No. 1 supplier, has launched a review aimed at cutting corporate overhead costs by as much as 30 percent, according to two sources familiar with the initiative.Lockheed would already reduce overhead substantially as part of an announced plan to sell or spin off an array of services businesses with revenue of $6 billion. The move will eliminate one of the $45 billion company's five current business divisions.Lockheed this week confirmed plans to reduce 250 jobs at its Missiles and Fire Control division, on top of 500 lay-offs already announced for the Information Systems and Government Services division now under strategic review.Lockheed is also analyzing other possible reductions and a range of combined goals, including a 30 percent cut in overhead costs. However, a cut of that magnitude is seen as a ""high-end figure that isn't likely,"" said one of the sources, who asked not to be named since no decisions have been made.""In a large company you have a lot of overhead and it's affecting more and more bid proposals in terms of cost,"" the source said. ""You're competing against people who are really hungry and willing to offer much lower prices."" Lockheed representatives declined to comment.Lockheed and other U.S. arms makers have been consolidating facilities, laying off workers and streamlining operations in recent years to cut costs due to a downturn in U.S. military spending. Continued budget uncertainty is driving executives to dig deeper and look for more savings. Northrop Grumman Corp (NOC.N) this week said it would streamline its business sectors from four to three to better align with the U.S. Defense Department's changing needs.Howard Rubel, defense analyst with Jefferies Group, said Lockheed also faced pressure from the Pentagon to offer price concessions in several billion-dollar contracts it is negotiating: a five-year contract for up to 83 C-130J transport planes, and two separate deals for about 160 F-35 fighter jets.""They might as well use the impetus of (those contracts) to cut cost and offset the concessions they're being asked to make,"" he said. Lockheed is also restructuring the Lockheed Martin International division it first set up in July 2013 to help the company win more international orders, according to three sources familiar with the matter. Final decisions have not been made, but the business is being converted to a support function to make it work more efficiently, said one of the sources.

745,"  (Adds background about contract negotiations)By Andrea ShalalWASHINGTON Oct 15 Lockheed Martin Corp  on Thursday said it had reached a  verbal agreement with the U.S. Air Force on a five-year contract to build up to 83 C-130J Super Hercules transport planes for the Air Force, Coast Guard and Marine Corps through 2020.The company said its goal was to complete the remaining contract actions, certifications and congressional notifications and finalize the deal by the end of the year, Pentagon documents put the value of a 79-aircraft deal at around $5.9 billion in 2013, when negotiations over the agreement first began.""We have reached a verbal agreement on the C-130J multiyear II contract,"" Lockheed spokesman Joe LaMarca told Reuters in response to a query. He gave no details on the value of the multiyear deal, or the amount of savings it would provide, compared to buying the airplanes one year at a time. The agreement was reached late last week after over two years of negotiations. It was not immediately clear why the negotiations took so long to conclude. Lockheed officials told Reuters in September 2013 that they expected the multiyear agreement to generate savings of at least $600 million for the U.S. government, or more than 10 percent, compared to buying the planes one year at a time.Lockheed has sold C-130J transport planes to 16 countries, and 330 of the turboprop planes have been delivered or are currently on order. The planes, which are able to touch down on austere landing zones, are used for humanitarian relief missions, special operations, aerial refueling, close air support, and search and rescue.Air Force acquisition chief William LaPlante last week warned that the C-130J multiyear agreement could be jeopardized if Congress fails to pass a budget for fiscal 2016 and relies on a series of continuing resolutions to fund the government.

746,"  (Adds share price drop, details from earnings call)By Ankit Ajmera and Andrea ShalalOct 20 Lockheed Martin Corp, the Pentagon's No. 1 weapons supplier, on Tuesday reported better-than-expected quarterly results on higher demand for its F-35 fighter jets and said it expects full-year revenue and profit at the high end of its forecast.Lockheed shares initially fell 2.5 percent on disappointment about its forecast for flat revenues and lower margins in 2016, but they recovered to close at $208.73, down just under 1 percent from Monday.Lockheed also won U.S. government approval to sell up to four of its smaller warships to Saudi Arabia, a deal with an overall price tag of $11.25 billion. The company said it expects to finalize the deal in 2016, along with a big order from Qatar for its THAAD ballistic missile defense system.Chief Executive Marillyn Hewson told analysts that Lockheed remained on track to boost international sales to 25 percent of overall revenues in coming years.Revenue at Lockheed's aeronautics division increased about 11 percent to $3.92 billion in the third quarter, with $500 million coming from additional sales of the F-35 fighter jet, the company said. Lockheed is developing and building F-35 jets for the U.S. military and nine other countries. With estimated development and procurement costs of $391 billion for the United States alone, the F-35 is the world's most expensive weapons program.Lockheed's prospects for selling 65 F-35 jets to Canada dimmed after the election of Liberal leader Justin Trudeau as prime minister given Trudeau's vow to reject any F-35 purchases, U.S. industry and government sources said.The company said it expected to finalize its planned $9 billion purchase of helicopter maker Sikorsky Aircraft from United Technologies Corp in the fourth quarter.The company said it would revise its 2015 forecast after it closed that deal and completed a strategic review aimed at selling or spinning off its services businesses. Excluding both moves, total operating margin in 2016 should range from 11.0 percent to 11.5 percent, down from the expected margin of about 12 percent in 2015, it said.The company forecast 2015 sales of $45 billion, and segment operating profit of $5.4 billion. Its previous forecast called for sales of $43.5 billion to $45 billion and segment operating profit of $5.225 billion to $5.375 billion.Lockheed also forecast earnings per share of $11.30 in 2015, the high end of its earlier forecast of $11.00 to $11.30. Analysts, on average, look for 2015 sales of $44.82 billion and earnings of $11.38 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Lockheed said it had $2.4 billion in potential cost and termination liability exposure, given its decision to self-fund work on C-130J transport planes and F-35 jets while contracts are being negotiated with the U.S. government.It said it was finalizing both deals and expected to receive more funding this year, but about $750 million in cash payments could be delayed until 2016.For the quarter ended Sept. 27, total net sales rose to $11.46 billion from $11.11 billion a year earlier.Net income fell to $865 million, or $2.77 per share, from $888 million, or $2.76 per share, a year earlier.Analysts, on average, expected profit of $2.72 per share on revenue of $11.14 billion.

747,"  (Adds F-35, Boeing comments, further background)By Andrea ShalalWASHINGTON Oct 20 The election of Canada's Liberal leader Justin Trudeau as prime minister spells bad news for Lockheed Martin Corp's F-35 fighter jet program given Trudeau's staunch opposition to any F-35 purchases, U.S. industry and government sources said on Tuesday.Trudeau's election offers hope to Boeing Co, whose F/A-18E/F fighter jets are nearing the end of production and could be considered to replace Canada's current aging CF-18 fighter jets.Industry executives and government officials said there would be difficulty ahead for the F-35 program. Trudeau last month said that, if elected, his party would launch an open and transparent competition to replace Canada's older aging CF-18 jets with more affordable aircraft. He said his government would not buy any F-35 jets.Pentagon data show the last batch of F-35 A-model jets cost $108 million each, although that price is slated to drop to $85 million by 2018. Boeing's F/A-18E/F currently costs $60 million per aircraft, according to the U.S. Navy.For now, Canada remains one of the nine countries in the initial F-35 partnership. It pledged to invest $150 million in the program's development when it signed up in February 2002. Those funds will not be reimbursed if Canada exits the program. Many Canadian firms that supply parts worth hundreds of millions of dollars to Lockheed each year could also lose those orders, according to two sources familiar with the program but not authorized to speak publicly.Lockheed and the Pentagon's F-35 program office said they had not been notified by the Canadian government of any change in its status as an F-35 partner. Boeing said it supported competition for the CF-18 replacement to ensure the best value for Canadian taxpayers and the greatest benefits to Canadian industry.Canada's ruling Conservatives announced plans in 2010 to buy 65 F-35 jets, but scrapped those plans in 2012 after a probe found officials had played down the costs and risks of the deal.A subsequent review found that Lockheed's F-35 scored the best on various tests, but Boeing's F/A-18E/F Super Hornet was almost as capable and cheaper.The 65 aircraft orders at stake could amount to well over $6 billion in revenue for Lockheed, engine maker Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp, and other key F-35 suppliers such as Northrop Grumman Corp and Britain's BAE Systems Plc.

755,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The U.S. government said on Tuesday it has approved the sale of up to four Lockheed Martin Corp multi-mission warships, plus associated equipment, training and logistics to Saudi Arabia, a deal valued at $11.25 billion overall.The Pentagon's Defense Security Cooperation Agency, which oversees foreign military sales, notified U.S. lawmakers late Monday about the possible sale, and released a statement on its website on Tuesday.""We stand ready to support that sale,"" Lockheed Chief Executive Officer Marillyn Hewson told analysts on an earnings call. She said the deal could be completed in 2016.DSCA said the major defense equipment involved in the deal was worth $4.3 billion, with the rest going to fund extensive engineering, logistics and training required for the program.Lawmakers have 30 days to block the sale, although such action is rare since potential deals are carefully vetted before formal notification. Reuters reported in September that Saudi Arabia was in advanced discussions with the U.S. government about buying two of the ships, and could reach agreement by the end of the year. It was not immediately clear if the Gulf country would buy all four ships at once.The sale is part of a larger modernization of the Royal Saudi Navy's Eastern Fleet, and will replace older U.S.-built ships with new ships based on the Littoral Combat Ships (LCS) that Lockheed currently builds for the U.S. Navy together with its major supplier, Italy's Fincantieri.The Saudi Naval Expansion Program II, or SNEP II, has been under discussion for years. U.S. sources said Saudi Arabia's concerns about Iran accelerated the effort.  It will be the first major export in years of a newly built U.S.-manufactured surface naval vessel, and will allow the U.S. military to operate more easily with those of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.""This sale demonstrates the enduring U.S. commitment to building robust diplomatic and security partnerships essential to promoting peace and stability in the Gulf region,"" said one U.S. official who was not authorized to speak publicly. The sale would include equipment such as radar and sonar systems and munitions and fire-control systems. Lockheed and Sikorsky Aircraft, a United Technologies Corp unit, hope to finalize another key part of the modernization effort by year-end: a $1.9 billion order of 10 MH-60R helicopters, one of the sources said. Lockheed expects to complete its takeover of Sikorsky this  year.U.S. lawmakers were notified in May about the MH-60R deal.

756,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Lockheed Martin Corp has won a contract valued at $784 million to build a new long-range radar that the U.S. Missile Defense Agency considers ""critically important"" to improving its ability to protect the U.S. homeland, the Pentagon said on Wednesday.Lockheed, the Defense Department's No. 1 supplier, beat out Raytheon Co and Northrop Grumman Corp to win the contract to design and build the new Long Range Discrimination Radar.U.S. officials have said the radar, which will be built in Clear, Alaska and is due to start operating in 2020, will expand the ability of the U.S. military to detect and respond to potential missile launches from North Korea.Lockheed said it drew on its experience building Aegis radar systems for the Navy and a separate Aegis Ashore site in Romania, as well as its work on a variety of other missile defense programs in shaping its winning bid.Another key enabler, the company said, was its work on the Space Fence, another long-range radar system it is building for the U.S. Air Force that will detect, track, and catalog orbital objects to predict and prevent space-based collisions. That system passed a critical design review last month, paving the way for the start of construction on Kwajalein Island - another remote location.Vice Admiral James Syring, director of the U.S. Missile Defense Agency, told a congressional hearing in March that the new long-range radar was critically important to provide a consistent ability to track and respond to potential North Korean missile launches.“We must have consistent track and elimination capability against that threat,"" he said at the time. ""It’s a must.” The contract runs through January 2024.Brad Hicks, who heads business development for Lockheed's integrated warfare systems and sensors business, said the company used an open architecture approach, commercial technologies and very mature military systems to design the new radar, which will be the size of about four tractor-trailer trucks.Asked about the ability of the new radar to discriminate real missiles from fake warheads, or salvos of multiple missiles at a time, Hicks said only that the system was required to deal with an array of advanced threats. Raytheon said it remained confident in the solution it proposed and was awaiting a post-award briefing from the Missile Defense Agency.Northrop Grumman had no immediate comment.Analysts said they expected one or both of the losing bidders to file a protest against the decision.

ALIS will automatically capture and disseminate data about the F-35's performance and components, pilot and technician training, scheduling, technical data, and the ordering of parts. Lockheed is developing and building F-35 jets for the U.S. military and nine other countries.The company is due to complete ALIS 2.0.2 in November, paving the way for initial testing in January and formal system security testing in May, Bogdan told the Tactical Air and Land Forces Subcommittee of the House Armed Services Committee.""There is schedule pressure that we are monitoring very closely and attempting to mitigate"" to meet the Air Force's target date of Aug. 1 to declare an initial squadron of 12 F-35s ready for combat use,"" he said.

But the Pentagon was working closely with the Air Force to find solutions to the aircraft shortfall, he said. In general, he said, the F-35 program was showing increased reliability and passing significant testing milestones, including ground test firings of internal weapons.He said the department was still working to reduce Lockheed's control over the maintenance of the jets, resolve shortfalls of spare parts, reduce the cost of building the jets, and ensure completion of critical software.

773,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The U.S. Air Force is due to brief Boeing Co on Friday about its decision to award Northrop Grumman Corp a huge contract to build a next-generation long-range strike bomber, according to two sources familiar with the matter.Boeing, which had teamed up with Lockheed Martin Corp, told its staff in a memo on Tuesday that it would ""rigorously deliberate"" whether to protest the contract award, with a decision likely within two weeks. Under federal law, companies have 10 days after an agency debrief to file with the U.S. Government Accountability Office, an arm of Congress that rules on federal contract protests. The GAO then has 100 days to evaluate the case.Boeing will likely take several days to evaluate what it learned and consider whether to file a protest, the sources said.Boeing declined to comment. Air Force officials could not immediately be reached for comment. The Air Force on Tuesday selected Northrop, maker of the stealthy B-2 bomber, to develop and build the new bomber, a deal analysts value at up to $80 billion.    Boeing and Lockheed immediately said they wanted answers on how the competition was scored with regard to price and risk.Air Force officials have declined to comment publicly about how the two bids compared. They said only that Northrop's bomber represented the ""best value for the nation"" and would cost $511 million per plane, on average, in 2010 dollars, well below the program's cost cap of $550 million per plane. Boeing executives were in ""total shock"" about the contract loss, said one of the sources, given the combined strength and capabilities of the Pentagon's two largest suppliers.Executives were concerned that the Air Force had not fully accounted for risks involved in setting up a new large airplane production line, as Northrop must do given that it is not currently producing large numbers of combat aircraft.Northrop does build the center fuselage for Lockheed's F-35 fighter jet, the aft and center fuselage for Boeing's F/A-18E/F fighter jet, and the Global Hawk high-altitude drone. Boeing and Lockheed were also concerned about whether a recent warning by Pentagon acquisition chief Frank Kendall about the undue influence of increasingly large defense contractors had factored into the decision, said one of the sources.""When you make a statement like that, and then give a contract like to a smaller and less experienced company, it does raise suspicion. That will be closely looked at,"" said the source.

Lockheed last month said it had $2.4 billion in potential cost and termination liability exposure, given its decision to self-fund work on F-35 jets and C-130J cargo planes while negotiating contracts with the government.Tuesday's agreement will allow the company to continue production of the F-35 jets while it finalizes the terms of an agreement with the Pentagon, said Lockheed spokesman Michael Rein. ""This allows us to continue production with no interruptions,"" he said. The immediate funding of $625 million comes on top of $698 million in advancement procurement funding already awarded to Lockheed for the ninth batch of jets.Those sums will be deducted from the total contract when the two sides reach a final agreement. The Pentagon is negotiating a separate contract with Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp (UTX.N), for engines to power the 55 jets. Joe DellaVedova, spokesman for the F-35 program, said the program expected to reach a handshake agreement with Pratt by the end of the year, and then finalize the contract in early 2016.The ninth batch of jets includes 41 F-35 A-model jets for the U.S. Air Force, Norway, Israel and Japan; and 12 F-35 B-model jets, which can handle short takeoffs and vertical landings, for the Marine Corps and the British navy, as well as two carrier-variant F-35C jets for the U.S. Navy.

Under federal law, the U.S. Government Accountability Office, an arm of Congress that rules on federal contract protests, now has 100 days to evaluate the issue.The GAO said its ruling was due on Feb. 16, 2016. Northrop said that as the only company to design and build a stealth bomber, it was the best option. “Northrop Grumman Corporation is disappointed that its former LRS-B competitors have decided to disrupt a program that is so vital to national security,” said Randy Belote, vice president of strategic communications.The Air Force said that while Boeing had the right to protest, it was “confident that the source selection team followed a deliberate, disciplined and impartial process.”“Once resolved, we look forward to proceeding with the development and fielding of the LRS-B aircraft,” said Major Robert Leese, an Air Force spokesman.Analysts had widely expected either losing team to protest the award, given the high stakes and the dearth of other large-scale U.S. arms programs in coming years. The decision to file the protest reflected concerns about the Air Force's use of cost data from earlier bomber programs to assess the pricing of the planes, devaluing innovations and new manufacturing processes implemented in recent years, according to two sources familiar with the companies' thinking.Boeing and Lockheed also believe the Air Force failed to properly evaluate the risks involved with Northrop's bid since the company has been a supplier, not prime contractor, on military aircraft programs in recent years, the sources said.Loren Thompson, a defense consultant with close ties to Boeing and Lockheed, said the review led by Boeing General Counsel Michael Luttig, a former federal judge, concluded that there was solid grounds for challenging the award. ""This is shaping up to be a replay of the tanker award when Boeing challenged the way in which Northrop was awarded a future Air Force program,"" he said. The Air Force later canceled that contract with Northrop and ultimately selected Boeing to build the refueling planes.In a column in Forbes magazine on Friday, Thompson said the official estimate that it would cost $21.4 billion to develop the plane was roughly twice what the competing industry teams bid. It also leaves the government liable for possible cost overruns - despite repeated calls by lawmakers for a different approach.He said the Air Force chose Northrop's bid because of its ""rock-bottom"" price for developing the plane, and never rigorously analyzed the cost of production or maintenance over the life of the aircraft.

791,"   By Tim Hepher and Andrea Shalal | DUBAI  DUBAI Nov 8 After three years of record jetliner orders, planemakers are bracing for a slowdown in new commitments at the Dubai Airshow which opens on Sunday under the shadow of recently falling oil prices and conflicts in the Middle East.Barring traditional show surprises, delegates attending the biennial Nov 8-12 event predicted a drop in major commercial order announcements as Gulf airlines take stock after expansion.The aerospace industry is putting a brave face on the slowdown, saying the tally of more than 400 orders at the 2013 edition was never going to be repeatable. But analysts will be scanning the announcements for any evidence that the dip is more than a return to normality.Aerospace investors are concerned that a glut of wide-body jets rolling off production lines towards the end of this decade could put pressure on aviation, just as doubts gather over the pace of economic activity.""A lot of airlines have bought aircraft to capture the same growth,"" said Ben Moores, senior analyst at IHS Aerospace, Defence & Security. That does not mean the Nov 8-12 bazaar, where airliners and arms buyers mingle at Dubai's newest aviation hub, will be lacking in financial or military firepower.Major General Ibrahim Nasser Al Alawi, commander of the UAE Air Force and Air Defence, said over $206 billion in orders were booked at the 2013 Dubai air show, adding: ""This year's air show is on course to be even bigger and better.""Boeing said on Saturday it remained confident about long-term jetliner demand, particularly in the Middle East which is expected to need more than 3,000 jets in 20 years. Etihad Airways may emerge as the buyer of 10 777X jets listed anonymously on Boeing's website, Gulf sources said, though an announcement may not happen at the show. Both companies declined comment.DEALS  The recent commercial order boom is expected to lead to deals putting parts manufacturing back into the UAE and India at the show. And in defence, at least four Gulf nations are negotiating new fighter purchases.UAE officials told the Dubai International Air Chiefs conference it would extend spending on air power and other items, despite the cost of fighting against insurgents in Yemen.But executives see some Gulf countries pulling back on military modernisation programmes, even though IHS's Moores noted the region's biggest buyers were most able to weather lower oil revenues.Qatar is seen likely to slow plans to acquire Lockheed Martin's THAAD missile defences, but others like Saudi Arabia are accelerating their orders.""We're anxious to see what happens to the weapons projects,"" said one executive.

Lockheed has sold F-16s to Oman, Bahrain, Iraq, Jordan, Egypt and United Arab Emirates, but remains in discussions with Kuwait, Qatar and Saudi Arabia about other potential opportunities, Groesch said.He said low operating costs and the advantages of being able to operate seamlessly with other air forces were big selling points. ""They need the best bang for their dollar,"" he said. ""They're starting to see that in the F-16.""Howard said Lockheed expected a decision in the next weeks or months from Indonesia, where the F-16 is competing for an order of about 15 jets against the Gripen built by Sweden's SAAB (SAABb.ST), Russia's SU-35, and others. Lockheed is also gearing up for a potential new Indian fighter competition in coming years after India truncated its order for fighter planes from France's Dassault Aviation (AVMD.PA) from 126 to 36 jets.Lockheed Chief Executive Marillyn Hewson met with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi when he visited the United States in September, and sources say the company is ready to set up a manufacturing line for the F-16 in India, a key priority under the country's ""Make in India"" initiative.

But she said it would wait to see how the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO)ruled on a formal protest filed against the decision by Boeing Co (BA.N) and Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N).The contract to build a long-range strike bomber is expected to be worth around $80 billion to the winner in coming decades.

Boeing and Lockheed, the Pentagon's two largest suppliers who worked as a team on the bid, said last week they believed the Air Force process was ""fundamentally flawed"" and did not properly evaluate the relative or comparative risk of the competing bids.They said they were concerned about the Air Force's use of cost data from earlier bomber programs to assess the pricing of the planes, devaluing innovations and new manufacturing processes implemented in recent years, sources said at the time. Analysts had widely expected that whoever lost out on the deal, either Boeing and Lockheed or Northrop, would protest the award, given its size and a dearth of other large-scale U.S. arms programs in coming years.James told reporters that historical cost data was part of the process, but other factors also played a role.

Companies developing small satellite networks include Google’s SkyBox Imaging, BlackSky Global, which is backed by Paul Allen’s Vulcan Capital, Planet Labs, UrtheCast, PlanetiQ, GeoOptics and Spire Global.Between 410 and 543 microsatellites, weighing up to 110 pounds (50 kg) will need launches globally in 2020, compared to 92 microsatellites launched in 2013, SpaceWorks noted in a 2014 market study. The Lockheed-Boeing launch alliance will compete with several companies that are developing dedicated CubeSat and small satellite launchers.

806,"   By Phil Stewart | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Nov 21 The Pentagon expects the new Canadian government to allow Lockheed Martin Corp's F-35 fighter aircraft to compete to replace Canada's aging CF-18 jets, despite the Liberal Party's stated opposition to the planes, U.S. Deputy Defense Secretary Bob Work said on Saturday.But Work cautioned after talks in Canada that how the fledgling government sets its requirements for the competition would ultimately determine what jet the country gets.""I think they're going to have another full and open competition. I think the F-35 will be part of that but the requirements from the competition may change. We don't know,"" Work told reporters traveling with him back from Canada.Work's comments came a day after Canada's new Defense Minister Harjit Sajjan, in an interview with Reuters, said it would be ""premature"" to talk about the F-35 or any aircraft that might or might not be able to replace the CF-18. ""I'm focused on the requirements that we need ... as a nation that works with our allies as well, with NATO and our NORAD commitments,"" Sajjan said, referring to the North American Aerospace Defense Command.A decision not to go with the F-35 could raise the prospects for Boeing Co's F/A-18E/F fighters. Work said he only sounded out Sajjan when the two met in Halifax, Nova Scotia, adding: ""I wasn't here to put any pressure on.""Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau shook up his election campaign and the aerospace industry with his Sept. 20 announcement that he would not buy F-35s. He said he expected this to yield savings, which he would apply to naval ships. But Canada, one of the nine countries in the initial F-35 partnership, pledged to invest $150 million in the program's development when it signed up in February 2002.Those funds would not be reimbursed if Canada exits the program. Many Canadian firms that supply parts worth hundreds of millions of dollars to Lockheed each year could also lose those orders.Joe DellaVedova, spokesman for the F-35 program office, said on Friday that Canada remained a partner in the program and was still slated to participate in a meeting of the program's executive steering board in Italy early next month.""Similar to actions taken by other nations, the Government of Canada is working to launch an open and transparent competition to replace their legacy aircraft,"" he said.

821,"   By Irene Klotz | CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.  CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. Dec 3 A year after its Antares rocket exploded during launch, Orbital ATK is poised to resume cargo runs to the International Space Station, this time using a hired ride from United Launch Alliance, a Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing Co joint venture.Liftoff of the ULA Atlas 5 rocket is slated for 5:55 p.m. EST (2255 GMT) on Thursday from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida.Perched on top of the rocket is Orbital's fourth Cygnus spacecraft, an upgraded capsule filled with more than 7,700 pounds (3,500 kg) of food, supplies and science experiments for the station.""This is step one in the return-to-flight plan,"" said Mike Pinkston, Orbital's Antares program manager. Orbital expects to start using its own Antares rocket in May 2016. Dulles, Virginia-based Orbital had completed a test flight and two of its originally planned nine station cargo runs under a $1.9 billion contract with NASA, delivering about 8,400 pounds (3,800 kg) pounds of a promised 22 tons of supplies, when Antares faltered on Oct. 28, 2014.Investigators blamed the botched launch on a defective turbopump in one of Antares' two main engines, a Soviet-era motor refurbished and sold by Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings  . Exactly what went wrong remains a matter of debate, but Aerojet paid Orbital $50 million to settle the dispute and the companies ended their collaboration. Orbital, which already had planned to outfit Antares with new engines, grounded the rocket and quickly settled on a new supplier, Russia's NPO Energomash, the same company that supplies the RD-180 engines that power ULA's Atlas rocket.Ukraine-related trade sanctions enacted last year ban U.S. military use of the RD-180 engines. The ban does not affect  commercial and civilian government customers like the U.S. space agency, but it will keep Orbital from offering Antares as launcher for U.S. military satellites. Orbital, which competes against privately-owned Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX, and Sierra Nevada Corp for follow-on cargo delivery contracts, is counting on ULA's Atlas rocket to send its next two Cygnus capsules to the station, a $100 billion laboratory that flies about 250 miles (400 km) above Earth.Resupplying the station has been a challenge for NASA, following not only Orbital's accident, but the loss of a Russian Progress ship in April and a SpaceX Dragon capsule in June.(Reporting by Irene Klotz; Editing by Tom Brown)",2015-12-03,LMT,"Thu Dec 3, 2015 | 1:08pm EST",Orbital heading back to International Space Station on hired rocket,http://www.reuters.com//article/space-orbital-launch-idUSL8N13S47G20151203?type=companyNews

824,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Dec 4 Top U.S. arms makers are straining to meet surging demand for precision missiles and other weapons being used in the U.S.-led fight against Islamic State and other conflicts in the Middle East, according to senior U.S. officials and industry executives.Global demand for U.S.-made missiles and so-called smart bombs has grown steadily since their use in the first Gulf War. But the United States and a host of allies are now rushing to ensure a stable supply of such weapons for what is expected to be a long fight against Islamic State, whose rise has fueled conflict in Syria and across a swathe of the Middle East.U.S. officials say arms makers have added shifts and hired workers, but they are bumping up against capacity constraints and may need to expand plants or even open new ones to keep weapons flowing. That could create further log-jams at a time when U.S. allies are voicing growing concern that Washington's processing of arms sales orders is too slow.Islamic State's deadly attacks in Paris last month have added urgency to the U.S.-led bombing campaign against the group in Iraq and Syria. The campaign had resulted in 8,605 strikes at an estimated cost of around $5.2 billion as of Dec. 2.Meanwhile, a Saudi-led coalition including Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates and backed by Washington is carrying out a nine-month-old military campaign against Iran-backed rebels in Yemen. Gulf states are also supplying U.S.-made arms to rebels fighting Syria's government in that country's four-year-old war.""It's a huge growth area for us,"" said one executive with a U.S. weapons maker, who was not authorized to speak publicly.""Everyone in the region is talking about building up supplies for five to ten years. This is going to be a long fight"" against Islamic State.The impact is palpable in Troy, Alabama, where Lockheed Martin Corp builds its 100-pound Hellfire air-to-ground missiles at a 3,863-acre highly secured facility surrounded by woods and horse pastures. Realtors are adding staff in anticipation of new hiring at the plant, and the large grocery chain Publix is opening a store soon.""What's good for Lockheed is good for Troy,"" said Kathleen Sauer, president of the Pike County Chamber of Commerce, adding that the expansion was helping a local economy where unemployment rates are already among the lowest in the state.""Look at our downtown,"" she said. ""Almost all the stores are open and we have more coming in.""Lockheed has added a third shift at its plant, which employed 325 workers as of February, and is now at ""maximum capacity,"" said one executive familiar with the issue. The company announced in February that it will add 240 workers by 2020 and expand the facility, which also produces a 2,000-pound air-to-surface stealthy missile.Frank Kendall, the Pentagon's chief arms buyer, told Reuters this week there has been particularly strong demand for the Hellfire missiles. At $60,000 to $100,000 apiece they are inexpensive compared to many missiles and can be launched from everything from aircraft and helicopters and ships to destroy armored vehicles or punch into buildings.Kendall and other senior U.S. officials told Reuters they are working with Lockheed, Raytheon Co and Boeing Co.  to ramp up production of precision munitions and potentially add new capacity.""We are watching that closely. We are looking at the need to increase capacity,"" Kendall said. SALES SURGING Defense shares have performed strongly in recent months on expectations of better results, and many soared after the attacks in Paris.Total U.S. foreign military sales approvals surged 36 percent to $46.6 billion in the year through September 2015 from around $34 billion a year earlier. Approved sales of missiles, smart bombs and other munitions to U.S. allies jumped to an estimated $6 billion in fiscal 2015 from $3.5 billion a year earlier.This year alone, the U.S. government has approved the sale of Hellfires to South Korea, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, France, Italy and Britain. In June, the U.S. Army said it had asked Lockheed to boost production of the Hellfire from 500 per month to 650 by November.""There are essentially waiting lists for Hellfire. They can't make them fast enough,"" said one State Department official, who asked not to be identified.Lockheed declined to provide any details about how it is meeting increased demand for Hellfires and other munitions. In addition to approved foreign military sales, many munitions sales are overseen by the U.S. Commerce Department and negotiated directly between countries and companies. U.S. weapons makers do not routinely report such sales, and do not break down revenues by specific weapons.Also in high demand, Kendall said, are Boeing's Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) kits, which turn unguided munitions into smart bombs and have been used consistently to strike Islamic State targets in Iraq and Syria.Last month, the State Department approved a $1.29 billion deal with Saudi Arabia for more than 22,000 JDAMS and other types of precision-guided bombs.Boeing said it boosted the daily production rate of JDAMs at its facility outside St. Louis by 80 percent in July to meet demand from the U.S. military and more than 25 other countries.Raytheon, one of the largest U.S. munitions makers,  declined comment on its missile production work. The company has a large missile production facility in Tucson, Arizona, which could potentially boost production, Kendall said.REACHING CAPACITY  Kendall said U.S. manufacturers had been ""very responsive,"" but some facilities were already reaching maximum capacity and it would take years for firms to make necessary expansions.He said the U.S. government could potentially chip in to defray the cost of new facilities and tooling, but that would be addressed on a case-by-case basis.It takes time for foreign and U.S. orders to be processed by the U.S. bureaucracy and translate into contracts for companies, but that is now occurring, stretching many facilities to capacity limits, according to industry executives, who were not authorized to speak publicly.Vice Admiral Joe Rixey, director of the Pentagon's Defense Security Cooperation Agency, said industry was keeping up with demand thus far but that pressures were mounting.""We are reacting to get it done,"" Rixey told Reuters. ""We're working on purchasing capacity and shifts.""Defense shares have been buoyed by a two-year congressional budget agreement that ensures stable funding for fiscal 2016 and 2017, share buybacks and growing confidence that a revenue trough is nearly over.Raytheon told analysts in October that its missile sales - which account for about 28 percent of overall revenues - jumped 11 percent in the third quarter and looked set for further growth in the fourth quarter.Lockheed and Boeing do not provide details about their missile sales, but they account for a relatively small - albeit growing - portion of their defense businesses, according to analysts.The long-term increase in demand is also expected to boost revenues for key suppliers such as Orbital ATK and Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings Inc, which make the propulsion systems for many of the missiles.U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff General Mark Welsh said the U.S. military had increased its orders in recent years to replenish and expand its stockpiles, but more work was needed. He said Washington was encouraging its allies to do the same.""We all have to be better at pre-planning for munitions, because they're expensive and we don't have an industrial base that can spin up over night and produce them,"" he said last week after a speech hosted by the Atlantic Council think tank.For U.S. towns and cities that are reliant on the arms industry for growth, the growth is welcome economic news despite the rise in global conflicts.""It's a dangerous world,"" said Kevin Flowers, who works at Alabama Real Estate Connection in Troy, which he said was adding staff in anticipation of further expansion by Lockheed.""We have to be ready. Better safe than sorry.""

825,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Dec 3 Former U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry said on Thursday U.S. defense officials should be ""very explicit"" when urging weapons makers to reduce industry overhead costs, in order to avoid another round of consolidation.Further consolidation would be ""moving in the wrong direction,"" Perry, a close friend and mentor of current Defense Secretary Ash Carter, told a defense writers group.The legendary ""last supper"" for top industry executives that Perry hosted in 1993, as President Bill Clinton's deputy defense secretary, was aimed at reducing overhead costs instead of triggering a massive wave of ""unnecessary"" and ""undesirable"" industry mergers, he said.""We applied the right pressure back in the mid-1990s, but we got some ... unintended consequences,"" including fewer companies and less competition, Perry said. ""As we face this problem in the future, we should learn from that lesson."" U.S. officials have to be ""very explicit that we are not looking for consolidation, that we're looking for removing excess overhead from individual companies.""Dozens of companies merged in the 1990s as military spending fell sharply after the Cold War ended. The changes left five large contractors that still dominate the market: Lockheed Martin Corp, Boeing Co, Northrop Grumman Corp , General Dynamics Corp and Raytheon Co. Overhead costs fell somewhat, but the department would have been ""better off with more, smaller firms than with a few large ones,"" Perry said.His comments underscored concerns voiced by Carter and his chief arms buyer, Frank Kendall, in September, when they warned that further consolidation among large weapons makers could lead to higher costs, decreased innovation and less competition. Carter and Kendall spoke days after the U.S. Justice Department approved Lockheed's $9 billion purchase of Sikorsky Aircraft from United Technologies Corp, one of the biggest acquisitions in the weapons industry in years.Kendall told reporters at the time that he hoped to work with Congress to draft legislation that would give the government more leverage to prevent mergers that left the department dependent on a smaller number of larger contractors, even if they did not necessarily have anti-trust implications.Perry said soaring personnel costs were eating up more of the defense budget now than before, reducing the funds available for new weapons programs and increasing pressures that could trigger a new wave of consolidation.

Apollo is still negotiating terms with PAE's owner, buyout firm Lindsay Goldberg & Co LLC, and there is no certainty it will finalize a deal, the people added.The sources asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential. PAE, Apollo, Platinum Equity and American Securities declined to comment. A Lindsay Goldberg representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Its clients include the U.S. Department of State mission in Iraq in its Baghdad Embassy Compound and the U.S. Consulate General in Basrah.Buyout firms, as well as defense contractors such as Lockheed Martin Corp, have been shedding their low-margin government services because company valuations are recovering as government spending, which took a nosedive following the end of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, begins to stabilize. Earlier this week, L-3 Communications Holdings Inc  said it would sell its government services division, National Security Solutions, to smaller defense contractor CACI International Inc for $550 million in cash. Lockheed Martin sold PAE to New York-based Lindsay Goldberg in 2011 for around $350 million, Reuters reported at the time.Founded in 1955, PAE has attempted in recent years to move into more sophisticated segments of government services through acquisitions.

839,"   By Alwyn Scott and Amrutha Penumudi  United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) forecast a slight profit rise next year and announced a $1.5 billion restructuring plan to reduce costs, sending its shares up in extended trading.The U.S. aerospace and building systems conglomerate said 2016 adjusted earnings will be $6.30 to $6.60 per share on revenue of $56 billion to $58 billion. Most of the EPS gain will come from share buybacks, it noted.The company also expects 2015 adjusted earnings of $6.20-$6.30 per share, raising the lower end of the previous estimate by 5 cents.The restructuring will cost about $500 million a year over three years, Chief Executive Officer Gregory Hayes said at an investor and analyst meeting. When completed, the program is expected to generate about $900 million in annual savings, mainly through factory consolidation, Hayes said.United Technologies shares were up 1.4 percent at $95.20 in extended trading. While the restructuring and about $2 billion in research and development spending next year could cause GAAP earnings to fall in 2016, it positions the maker of maker Otis elevators, Carrier heating and cooling systems and Pratt & Whitney aircraft engines for longer-term growth, Hayes said.The company expects slowing in China and weak growth in Latin America and Europe. It also forecasts the dollar at parity with the euro, versus an average of $1.12 per euro this year.  Analysts described the forecast as conservative. But it follows a year in which United Technologies cut its 2015 profit outlook three times and saw its results dented by the strong dollar and pressures in its various businesses.The Pratt & Whitney division is expected to see a slight rise in sales next year, and it faces rising costs as it ramps up production to about 200 units. Hayes said United Technologies is focused on ""reinvigorating top-line growth"" and would tolerate lower profit margins in some areas to increase sales. ""We have lost (market) share over the last 10 years,"" as margins rose to 20 percent from 12 percent, Hayes said. Analysts expect 2016 earnings of $6.57 per share on a revenue of $58.58 billion according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. They estimate 2015 earnings of $6.27 per share.United Technologies closed the $9 billion sale of Sikorsky Aircraft to Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) last month. The company said on Thursday it expects to record a $3.3 billion after-tax gain on the sale in the current quarter.

The company this week said it was considering all options, including a federal lawsuit, after the Government Accountability Office refused to extend the deadline for ruling on the protest despite the late discovery of a large number of documents that Lockheed said provided fresh grounds for protest.The GAO cited Lockheed's intention to file a lawsuit when it dismissed the company's protest over the $6.75 billion contract, saying it does not rule on matters that are under litigation. Ralph White, the GAO's managing associate general counsel, said the agency could have considered a supplemental protest from Lockheed to address additional information about the case, but the company ""chose not to file one.""On Thursday, after filing the complaint, Lockheed said it would work ""with all parties involved on the next steps."" Oshkosh said it remained confident that the Army conducted a ""thorough, methodical procurement including exhaustive testing and evaluation,"" and that the process had been validated by the GAO review.""We are confident that the U.S. Court of Federal Claims will expeditiously reach the same conclusion and the award to Oshkosh will be upheld,"" John Urias, executive vice president of Oshkosh Corp and president of Oshkosh Defense, said in a statement.""We are hopeful that this latest protest filing will not be permitted to further delay the JLTV program and delivery of these vehicles to provide greater protection for our troops in future missions,"" he said.

The two sides had hoped to reach agreement before year end, but have pushed the date to the first quarter, said  sources familiar with the discussions. Lockheed is developing and building three models of F-35 jets for the U.S. Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps, as well as for Britain, Norway, the Netherlands, Italy, Turkey, Australia, Israel, Japan and South Korea.Key suppliers to Lockheed are Northrop Grumman Corp and BAE Systems Plc.

874,"  WASHINGTON Jan 7 The U.S. State Department has approved the sale of 5,000 Hellfire missiles to Iraq worth $800 million, the Pentagon said on Thursday.Lawmakers have 30 days to block the sale, although such action is rare. The prime contractor on the deal would be Lockheed Martin Corp.The Defense Security Cooperation Agency, which oversees foreign arms sales, told lawmakers the government of Iraq had asked to buy 5,000 of the air-to-ground missiles and 10 training missiles. The missiles would contribute to the United States' national security and ""improve the Iraq Security Forces' capability to support ongoing combat operations,"" the agency said in a notice to lawmakers posted on its website.

875,"  WASHINGTON The United States and Saudi Arabia remain in discussions about the sale of four Lockheed Martin Corp warships and other equipment despite Riyadh's rejection of the initial U.S. offer, according to sources familiar with the matter.Saudi Arabia, grappling with 12-year low oil prices, balked at both the price offered by the U.S. Navy for the four frigates, and the proposed seven-year timeframe for delivery of the first ship, said two of the sources, who were not authorized to speak publicly.The U.S. government in October approved the sale to Saudi Arabia of up to four Lockheed multi-mission warships valued at up to $4.3 billion, plus associated training, engineering and logistics, which would bring the total value of the deal up to $11.25 billion. The ships are based on the steel monohull-designed Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) that Lockheed is building for the Navy together with Italy's Fincantieri SpA.

880,"  (Adds savings on engines, other negotiations, byline)By Andrea ShalalWASHINGTON Jan 15 Engine maker Pratt & Whitney has reached an agreement with the Pentagon about two separate contracts to build 167 engines to power the F-35 fighter jet built by Lockheed Martin Corp, the company and Pentagon said in a joint statement.The statement did not include the value of the two contracts - a ninth batch of 66 engines and a 10th batch of 101 engines -  because details will only be finalized in coming weeks.However, a source familiar with the matter said the two deals, which also include engineering support, spare parts and program management, would be worth more than $3 billion to Pratt, a unit of United Technologies Corp. ""This agreement for the next two lots of F135 engines continues to drive down costs and that's critical to making the F-35 more affordable for the U.S. military and our allies,"" said Air Force Lieutenant General Chris Bogdan, who runs the $391 billion program for the Pentagon. ""We are ramping up production and witnessing tangible results.""The Pentagon's F-35 program office and the company said the agreement would lower the price of the 140 engines used for the conventional takeoff version of the jet, and the carrier variant by 3.4 percent from the previously negotiated price.The price of the 27 engines that will power the short takeoff and landing version of the jets was reduced by 6.4 percent from the previous contract, according to the statement. The eighth batch of engines had cost 3.5 percent to 4.5 percent less than the previous batch.Pratt had hoped to reach agreement on the two new contracts before the end of last year, but negotiations dragged on longer than expected. Lockheed continues to negotiate with the Pentagon about two separate contracts to build about 160 F-35 fighter jets for $15 billion.Company and Pentagon officials had also hoped to finalize those deals last year, but sources familiar with the discussions now say it may take a month or more to reach agreement.Bogdan has set a goal of reaching a price tag of $80 million to $85 million per aircraft, including the engine, by 2019.Lockheed is developing three versions of the stealthy, supersonic fighter jet for the U.S. military and key U.S. allies and nine other countries that have already ordered jets: Britain, Australia, Turkey, Italy, Norway, the Netherlands, Japan, South Korea and Israel.

886,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The USS Fort Worth, a new coastal warship built by Lockheed Martin Corp for the U.S. Navy, suffered damage to its combining gears while the ship was in port in Singapore, the Navy said on Thursday, citing an apparent crew error.The issue occurred during an operational test of the ship's port and starboard main propulsion diesel engines on Jan. 12 when a lack of lube oil triggered high temperature alarms on both sets of gears, according to a Navy official.Technical experts and shipyard personnel were on board to evaluate the gears and make needed repairs, the Navy said in a statement released late Thursday. It was unclear when the repairs would be completed, it said in the statement.  Combining gears allow the Fort Worth to configure different types and combinations of engines for propulsion at sea. The ship left her homeport of San Diego in November 2014 and is now on a 16-month rotational deployment to the U.S. 7th Fleet.Lieutenant Commander Matt Knight, U.S. Pacific Fleet spokesman, said problems involving watchstanding procedures were rare since crews were well-trained and familiar with the ship, one of two models of the Navy's Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) class.  ""We have the right resources in place to conduct the necessary inspections, determine the extent of the damage and required repairs, and return Fort Worth back to operational status,"" Knight said. ""We are working diligently to minimize the operational impact of this maintenance casualty.""The incident comes after a spate of issues involving the Navy's newest class of warships, which were designed to carry out a range of missions, including hunting for mines, submarines and surface warfare. The accident occurred just weeks after Defense Secretary Ash Carter told Navy Secretary Ray Mabus to truncate orders of the LCS class ships at 40, instead of ordering 52 ships as previously planned, a decision that Navy officials still hope to reverse.

The ship left her homeport of San Diego in November 2014 and is now on a 16-month rotational deployment to the U.S. 7th Fleet.Lieutenant Commander Matt Knight, U.S. Pacific Fleet spokesman, said problems involving watchstanding procedures were rare since crews were well-trained and familiar with the ship, one of two models of the Navy's Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) class.  ""We have the right resources in place to conduct the necessary inspections, determine the extent of the damage and required repairs, and return Fort Worth back to operational status,"" Knight said. ""We are working diligently to minimize the operational impact of this maintenance casualty.""The incident comes after a spate of issues involving the Navy's newest class of warships, which were designed to carry out a range of missions, including hunting for mines, submarines and surface warfare. The accident occurred just weeks after Defense Secretary Ash Carter told Navy Secretary Ray Mabus to truncate orders of the LCS class ships at 40, instead of ordering 52 ships as previously planned, a decision that Navy officials still hope to reverse.

Air Force officials could not be reached for immediate comment.  A fleetwide F-35 grounding ordered after an engine fire in 2014 prevented what would have been the jets' international premier at the annual Royal International Air Tatoo that year, and the world's biggest air show in Farnborough, outside London. Since then, an F-35 jet assembled in Italy has made its inaugural flight, marking the first-ever F-35 flight outside the United States.

The deployment would include pilots, mechanics, spare parts, equipment and the plane's computerized logistics system to test the ability to deploy the plane for combat, he said.The test would help the Air Force assess its ability to send the jets to other locations and ensure that they can be repaired and maintained, Silveria said.""What we’re trying to do is exercise the deployment concepts and to learn from maintenance and learn from (operations),"" Silveria said. Like any warplane, maintenance of the F-35 requires specialized tools and materials, and it was critical that all those tools travel with the jet when it deployed, he said.Silveria said the test deployment was part of an assessment of whether an initial squadron of F-35 jets was ready for combat. He said the warfare center was due to deliver that ""operational readiness assessment"" to General Hawk Carlisle, head of Air Combat Command, in July.Carlisle would use the assessment to help decide whether an initial squadron of F-35A fighter jets was ready for combat.  Silveria, a pilot who also flies the F-35, said the 12 F-35s based at Nellis Air Force Base were performing well in regular exercises with other aircraft, and had proven their ability to share data and communicate with fourth-generation jets. He said the jets were now also able to share data within a formation of four F-35 jets flying together - a capability he experienced during a flight in the past week. The Air Force hoped to declare that it had an ""initial operational capability"" of F-35s between August and December.

The Pentagon still plans to buy a total of 2,457 jets for all three military services in coming years, they added. The Pentagon's plan does not include an estimated 260 international F-35 orders over the five-year period, said the sources. Those orders could rise further over the period given potential orders from countries including Finland, Denmark, Belgium and Singapore, the sources said.The new plan calls for the Air Force to buy 243 F-35 jets through fiscal 2021, 45 fewer than planned, as the service juggles funds to pay for a new long-range bomber to be built by Northrop Grumman Corp (NOC.N), and KC-46A refueling planes to be built by Boeing Co (BA.N).  It calls for the Navy and Marine Corps to buy 64 F-35C jets, which can take off and land on aircraft carriers, over the next five years, and 97 F-35B jets, which can land like a helicopter, the sources said.Defense Secretary Ash Carter this week announced plans to buy 13 more F-35 fighter jets for the Navy and Marine Corps than planned last year, but he did not disclose the total number of jets to be purchased across the department.Two sources said the plans could actually represent an increase of 21 F-35 jets for the Navy and Marine Corps over the five-year period. No comment was immediately available on the discrepancy from Carter's office. The U.S. Marine Corps declared an initial squadron of 10 of its F-35B model jets ready for combat last July. The Air Force is due to follow suit in August, followed by the Navy in late 2018 or early 2019.

906,"   By Lewis Krauskopf | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Facing a hostile Congress in an election year, President Barack Obama will be hard-pressed to push through many of the proposals in his final budget as U.S. leader. But that could be a silver lining for investors: If the long-shot plans gain traction, companies that stand to win new business or funding from proposed spending, such as auto suppliers, hospital chains and construction firms, could get an unexpected boost to their shares.Some details of the budget plan, set to be unveiled on Tuesday, already are known. It will include $4 billion over 10 years for development of safe-driving vehicles, an area already of interest to many companies. Added funding could benefit suppliers such as Delphi Automotive, Autoliv and Mobileye, which are developing safety features for autonomously driven cars, and Lear, which makes electrical power systems, according to Brian Sponheimer, analyst at Gabelli & Co. ""The market discounts that any proposals by this administration will be if not ignored, then outright put down,"" Sponheimer said. ""There clearly is upside if it passes, but there is a very healthy skepticism that that is likely to take place.""Obama's plan to fund an overhaul of the nation's infrastructure through a $10-a-barrel tax on crude oil could also boost engineering and construction firms such as Granite Construction said Morris Ajzenman, an analyst at Griffin Securities. ""But I give very very little probability that it comes to pass.""Similarly, Ipsita Smolinski, managing director at healthcare research consulting firm Capitol Street, said it was doubtful the Republican Congress would approve Obama's plan to aid the 19 state governments that passed up an earlier offer to expand the Medicaid program for low-income Americans. Such a plan, she said, would benefit hospital companies including Tenet Healthcare and HCA Holdings and Medicaid insurers such as Centene and Molina Healthcare.More palatable to Congress could be Obama's push for $755 million to jumpstart cancer research. But that level of investment without being more targeted may not benefit any specific firms, given that so many drug and biotech companies are invested in developing cancer therapies. Major defense contractors - including Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon and General Dynamics - stand to benefit from the budget, said Sterne Agee CRT analyst Peter Arment.""It’s an election year, national security is at the top of the priority list and a lot of elected officials – they don’t want to be tied to cutting defense,"" Arment said.

The disclosure comes as the United States and its allies discuss ways to halt the spread of Islamic State in Libya and elsewhere in Africa from its self-declared caliphate in Syria and Iraq.The proposed increase in U.S. defense spending for north and west Africa is a component of a larger $7.5 billion Pentagon request for fiscal year 2017 to counter Islamic State.""The marginal increase is on the order of about $200 million associated with north Africa,"" one U.S. defense official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to a small group of reporters.Another U.S. defense official told Reuters the funds would also be directed to west Africa.Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Air Force General Paul Selva said the new funding was aimed at addressing threats from militant groups across Africa, including al Shabaab in the east, Boko Haram in the west, and Islamic State in Libya. ""The monies that we've put into the budget to address those threats in Africa are to be able to work with indigenous forces as well as partner forces to get at those three particular threats and others that might emerge,"" Selva said.U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter last week announced his intention to ramp up spending to counter Islamic State as he unveiled the broad details of Obama's proposed $582.7 billion defense budget.A key part of the $7.5 billion would go to munitions. Carter said the United States has used so many smart bombs and laser-guided rockets in Iraq and Syria that it is running low and needs to invest $1.8 billion for 45,000 more. The Air Force budget includes about 4,500 small diameter bombs, doubling the previous year's purchase. It also calls for  more than 30,000 Boeing Co (BA.N) Joint Direct Attack Munition tail kits, which turn unguided bombs into all-weather smart munitions using GPS guidance systems, compared to about 22,000 the previous year. The Navy is slated to buy 100 Hellfire missiles built by Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N), with the Air Force planning to buy around 280.The U.S. officials also said some of the $7.5 billion would go toward training and equipping Iraqi forces and fighters in Syria to counter Islamic State.Lieutenant General Vincent Stewart, director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, warned on Monday of the group's expansion to Libya, Egypt's Sinai Peninsula, Nigeria, Algeria and elsewhere.

911,"  (Adds details, byline)By Andrea ShalalWASHINGTON Feb 10 The Pentagon on Wednesday said it expects to reach agreement with Lockheed Martin Corp  in March on contracts for the next two batches of F-35 fighter jets, orders worth about a combined $15 billion that will lower the cost of each warplane to below $100 million.Air Force Lieutenant General Chris Bogdan, who runs the F-35 program for the Pentagon, said the negotiations with Lockheed were taking longer than expected because of differences over cost.""I'm not rushing into a bad deal,"" Bogdan told reporters during an update on the Pentagon's biggest weapons program. Lockheed and Pentagon officials had expected to reach a deal on contracts for the ninth and 10th batches of jets last year.Lockheed is building three models of the F-35 for the U.S. military and nine international customers - Britain, Australia, the Netherlands, Norway, Turkey, Italy, Japan, Israel and South Korea. The Pentagon expects to spend $391 billion to develop the plane and buy 2,457 of the supersonic, stealthy new warplanes.Bogdan spoke to reporters a day after the U.S. Defense Department released its fiscal 2017 budget, which calls for spending of $56.3 billion on 404 F-35 jets over the next five years, about 24 less than initially planned. Bogdan said delays in 45 Air Force orders over that time  would be offset by increased orders for the U.S. Navy, Marine Corps and foreign countries and would have a minimal effect on ongoing efforts to drive down the cost of the plane.Over six years beginning in the current fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30, the program expects to order 873 jets, 20 less than planned last year, for U.S. and foreign customers, he said. He said he still expected the jets to cost around $80    million to $85 million each by 2019, including inflation.Bogdan said the program was about 80 percent done with its $50-billion-plus development program for the jets, with the remaining flight tests to be completed in 2016 or 2017.He said the Pentagon decided to delay its participation in a planned block purchase of F-35 jets until 2019, but international partners still planned to proceed with a deal in 2018 that he said could help drive the price of the airplanes even lower than the $80 million target price.A modernization program to upgrade the jets would begin in late 2018, about six to 12 months later than expected, he said.

913,"  (Adds details from news conference, byline)By Andrea ShalalWASHINGTON Feb 9 The U.S. Defense Department on Tuesday proposed spending $56.3 billion to buy 404 Lockheed Martin Corp F-35 fighter jets over the next five years, with fewer-than-expected orders slowing the anticipated production ramp for the new jets.Pentagon Comptroller Mike McCord, briefing reporters on the overall $583 billion budget, said the number of F-35 purchases was less than planned last year but gave no details on the number of jets to be deferred over the five-year period.""We are trying to get it back up to where we wanted to be across the (future years defense plan), but ... it's unclear we'll be able to get this program back to the ramps that we had hoped for previously,"" McCord said.Reuters reported on Friday that the Pentagon would buy 24 fewer F-35s through fiscal 2021, about 5 percent to 7 percent fewer than planned last year. McCord said the Pentagon had to trim $4 billion from the F-35 program and other aircraft programs in fiscal 2017 and cut billions of dollars from other procurement accounts to bring the budget in line with a congressional budget agreement.At $391 billion, the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter is the Pentagon's largest weapons program and an easy target. In the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1, the Pentagon plans to buy 43 conventional takeoff F-35s for the Air Force, 16 F-35Bs that can land like a helicopter for the Marine Corps, and four F-35C jets, which can land on an aircraft carrier, for the Navy.The funding includes engines that will be built for the advanced warplanes by the Pratt & Whitney unit of United Technologies Corp.The Air Force had to defer purchases of 45 F-35s over the five-year period, according to Air Force officials, while the Navy and Marine Corps added 21 jets. McCord said the change was not expected to significantly increase the cost of each jet since international orders would help offset the drop in U.S. purchases.The Pentagon still plans to buy a total of 2,457 F-35 jets.The Navy also announced plans to spend $2.2 billion for 16 Boeing Co F/A-18E/F Super Hornets, including two funded as part of the fiscal 2017 war budget, and 14 in the fiscal 2018 base budget.It said it needs the extra Boeing jets given delays in the F-35 program, and longer-than-expected maintenance times for older model F/A-18s.

914,"   By Radhika Rukmangadhan and Andrea Shalal  Lockheed Martin Corp on Thursday said it would offer a modified version of its T-50 training jet developed jointly with Korea Aerospace Industries Ltd, instead of a newly designed plane, in the upcoming U.S. Air Force competition to build 350 new training planes.The U.S. Air Force aims to launch the competition in 2017 to replace its ageing fleet of T-38 planes, which are nearly 50 years old, and analysts have said it could eventually buy up to 600 planes.The competition - which industry sources say could be worth $8 billion to $10 billion for the winning bidder - is expected to be fierce. Boeing Co has teamed with Sweden's Saab to develop a new plane for the competition, while Textron Inc and Northrop Grumman Corp are designing their own new planes.Lockheed prepared a detailed proposal for both a high-end and lower-end new design as well, but decided at the end of last year to proceed with a modified T-50, Rob Weiss, who heads the company's famed Skunk Works design shop, told Reuters. He said the modified training plane would meet the government's needs at eight times less cost and three times quicker than a new design, and with far less risk. Weiss declined to provide any detailed cost data. Michael Griswold, director of T-50 business development for Lockheed, said company officials concluded they could not meet the Air Force's target of fielding an initial number of new training planes in 2024 with a new design - unless the program was structured to start production before design work was completed, something Air Force officials viewed as unacceptable.

Weiss said the Lockheed manufacturing line in Greenville was nearly complete, and the company could start accepting T-50 orders at the South Carolina plant by the end of the year.That would allow the Air Force to significantly accelerate its plans to field an ""initial operational capability"" of new training planes by four or five years, he said.

919,"   By David Ingram and Dena Aubin | NEW YORK  NEW YORK The type of accounting Boeing Co uses to reflect the enormous upfront costs of building its jetliners is unusual among large U.S. corporations and leaves a lot of judgment up to the company, accounting experts said.Shares in Boeing plunged as much as 11 percent on Thursday amid slowing sales and a report that securities regulators were investigating the company's accounting. Shares closed up 0.2 percent on Friday during a broad market rally.The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is looking into Boeing's use of a practice known as program accounting, Bloomberg reported on Thursday, citing people with knowledge of the matter. It was unclear whether the SEC would file any charges against Boeing. The SEC declined to comment.Boeing declined to comment on the reported SEC probe or its use of program accounting. Program accounting was historically used in the U.S. aerospace industry for decades as a way to spread billions of dollars in development costs over multiple years. The technique cuts the cost per plane in the early stages of a project, smoothing profit margins over time.The method is recognized under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and accountants have justified it by arguing that the upfront costs have a future ""learning curve"" benefit that should be reflected somehow. Boeing, which is the only U.S. commercial plane maker, appears to be alone in using program accounting. Accountants said they were not aware of other U.S. companies that employ it, and defense contracts are not handled that way because they have a different structure than airplane sales.McDonnell Douglas, which was acquired by Boeing in 1997, had been among the companies that used program accounting in the 1990s, according to media reports at the time. Under guidance proposed in 1981 by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, program accounting may be used only under a very narrow set of circumstances involving a recurring product that requires substantial investment and has high barriers to market entry. The method can go wrong if a company either initially overestimates the number of airplanes it plans to sell or its costs are significantly higher than planned, accountants said. Either scenario results in miscalculating the company's margin. Because of the estimates, ""you have to accept a great deal of subjectivity,"" said Robert Willens, a corporate tax and accounting consultant in New York. Because the company has the relevant information, ""it's hard for an outsider to criticize anything other than the sheer amount of costs that are capitalized,"" he said. Boeing has warned it might face about $9.7 billion in charges for the 787 and 747 programs if it cannot sell more of both aircraft. The company has more than $30 billion in deferred production and tooling costs that it has not yet charged against its income statement.Accounting is not a hard and fast science, and subjectivity comes into play in many areas. Program accounting, though, has become less common as a result of consolidation in the aerospace industry, and it is not the way that companies in other industries deal with large, early costs in a project.Even at Boeing there have been discussions about eliminating program accounting, a company spokesman told The New York Times in 1998. Boeing has stuck with it, even after it paid $92.5 million in 2002 to settle a securities fraud suit related to its accounting of costs. Boeing denied wrongdoing in the case. Boeing includes lengthy discussions of program accounting in its quarterly filings with the SEC.GAAP requires periodic assessments to make sure cost estimates are correct. If costs are more than originally estimated and a company is in a loss position, it is generally required to recognize that loss. Another accounting practice that is more common, known as percentage-of-completion accounting, is something of a mirror image of program accounting and is also used by companies with large, upfront costs.That practice allows certain companies, such as one that is constructing a unique building, to recognize revenue from the project as it is moving along rather than only at the project's completion. Lockheed Martin Corp, a defense contractor,  is among the companies that use percentage-of-completion accounting, according to its securities filings.

920,"  WASHINGTON The U.S. government said on Friday it had approved the sale to Pakistan of up to eight F-16 fighter jets built by Lockheed Martin Corp, radar and other equipment in a deal valued at $699 million.The Pentagon's Defense Security Cooperation Agency, which oversees foreign arms sales, said it had notified lawmakers about the possible deal.The agency said the F-16s would allow Pakistan's Air Force to operate in all-weather environments and at night, while improving its self-defense capability and bolstering its ability to conduct counter-insurgency and counter-terrorism operations.Lawmakers have 30 days to block the sale, although such action is rare since deals are well-vetted before any formal notification.India said it was disappointed with the U.S. decision. ""We disagree with their rationale that such arms transfers help to combat terrorism,"" Vikas Swarup, a spokesman for India's Foreign Ministry, said on Twitter. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker notified the Obama administration that he would not approve using U.S. funds to pay for the planes through the foreign military financing (FMF) program. That means Pakistan must fund the purchase itself, instead of relying on U.S. funds to cover about 46 percent of the cost. Given the funds it has available, Pakistan may be able to buy only four of the F-16 Block 52 models, and the associated radar and electronic warfare equipment, said one U.S. source familiar with the situation.Corker told Secretary of State John Kerry in a letter that he was concerned about Pakistan's ties to the Haqqani network, a militant group that U.S. officials have said is behind attacks in Afghanistan. ""I may reconsider my blanket hold on U.S. FMF assistance should the Pakistanis make progress on addressing my significant concerns about their support for the Haqqani network, but for now, if they wish to purchase this military equipment, they will do so without a subsidy from the American taxpayer,"" he wrote.One U.S. official said the administration was convinced that F-16s were the right platform to support Pakistan’s counter-terrorism and counter-insurgency operations.

Babione told reporters at the Air Force Association's annual Air Warfare Symposium in Orlando that the company and its key suppliers were continuing broad-based efforts to lower the cost of the new radar-evading warplane.Given growing international orders, the small number of jets to be deferred by the Pentagon was ""not significant,"" he said. Lockheed is continuing negotiations with the Pentagon's F-35 program office about a ninth and tenth batch of jets, and expects to reach an agreement in March, Babione said. That deal would mean that the overall cost of the planes had been reduced by well over 60 percent since the program's start in 2001.Air Force Lieutenant General Chris Bodgan, who runs the F-35 program for the Pentagon, told reporters earlier this month that he expected to reach agreement in March on the two contracts, which will be worth a combined $15 billion.

934,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON U.S. Air Force Secretary Deborah James on Friday unveiled the first image of a new Northrop Grumman Corp long-range bomber and said it would be designated the B-21, as losing bidder Boeing Co said it would forego further challenges.  James revealed the first artist's rendering of the secret bomber, an angular flying wing, at the Air Force Association's annual Air Warfare Symposium. She said the name of the new warplane would be chosen in a contest among service members.The program has been shrouded in secrecy since its inception for fear of revealing military secrets to potential enemies, and to avoid giving the losing bidders any details before their formal protest was rejected last week.Northrop won a contract worth an estimated $80 billion in October to develop and build 100 new bombers, but work on the  plane was delayed for months while federal auditors reviewed a protest by Boeing and its key supplier, Lockheed Martin Corp. Boeing said on Friday it would skip any further protests with the U.S. Government Accountability Office or in the federal courts.    The Air Force, under pressure from lawmakers and retired Air Force officers, has promised to release more information about the new plane in March.Although the program has now survived the legal protest process, it still faces hurdles in Congress.Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain said on Thursday he would block the Air Force's use of a cost-plus type of contract for the long-range bomber since it would hold the government responsible for cost overruns. The Air Force says that only the engineering and development phase of the program, valued at $21.4 billion, is structured as a cost-plus contract with incentive fees.Production of the first five sets of new bombers, usually the most expensive planes in a new class of aircraft, would be structured with a firm, fixed price, the service said. Analysts say the program will be worth around $80 billion in total, providing a boon to Northrop and its key suppliers, but the Air Force has said only that it expects to pay $511 million per plane in 2010 dollars.John Michael Loh, a retired four-star U.S. Air Force  general, has urged the Air Force to name Northrop's suppliers to shore up support in Congress, and avoid a rerun of the B-2 bomber program, which was scaled back from 132 planes to just 21, which drove the price of each plane sharply higher.

952,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Lockheed Martin Corp, known for making big, expensive military satellites that take years to complete, is setting ambitious targets for lowering costs, shortening the time it takes to build new satellites, and adopting new technologies.Rick Ambrose, who heads Lockheed's space business, said his goal over the next three to five years was to shorten the time it took to develop a new satellite by 40 percent, and to get to a point where satellites could be reprogrammed for new missions while already in orbit.Lockheed is scrambling to become more agile and lower its costs as the U.S. Air Force nears decisions on how to replace and augment the large missile warning and protected communications satellites that Lockheed builds.""Ultimately (the government) is going to go to a new architecture, so by reducing the cost, it helps the government and it also helps us get to the future,"" Ambrose told Reuters in an interview on Monday at the annual Satellite 2016 conference.Boeing Co, Northrop Grumman Corp and other firms are determined to wrestle away a portion of the satellite business that Lockheed now dominates. The Air Force has not yet released its acquisition plans for the new satellite systems. Ambrose said Lockheed had already cut $2.8 billion in cost from its main satellite portfolio, including the Space-Based Infrared System missile warning satellites and the Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) protected communications satellites.It had also lowered operating costs by shutting facilities. The company, which has built 850 satellites in past decades, was also trying to lower the cost of its Global Positioning System satellites, and had shaved 20 months off the time it took to finish the first GPS III satellite compared with the previous model it built.Increasing the number of common parts among satellites and standardizing interfaces for payloads would also help reduce the time it took to build new satellites, Ambrose said.Lockheed is adopting new technologies such as 3D printing, in which components are built by putting down layer after layer of powdered metals, he said. That process could lower costs and dramatically shorten production time, he said. Ambrose said Lockheed expected to complete testing of a 3D-printed 26-inch propellant tank in the second quarter, and had just begun work on a much larger 46-inch tank. Lockheed already has a 3D printed part on its Juno spacecraft which is due to arrive near Jupiter on July 4, and the Air Force is now testing a 3D printed part for use on the next AEHF satellite, Ambrose said.

954,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON, March 10  WASHINGTON, March 10 The selection of Pratt & Whitney to build the engines for the new Northrop Grumman Corp  B-21 bomber should help Pratt lower the cost of its F135 engines that power the F-35 fighter jet, a top Air Force general said Thursday.Lieutenant General Chris Bogdan, who runs the $391 billion F-35 program, said lessons learned from the F135 engine program, any commonality between the engines, and greater engine production could help drive down costs on both programs.""I would expect that Pratt's prices on the F135 ought to come down as a result of the work they're going to be doing on the long-range strike (bomber),"" he told reporters after speaking at an event hosted by U.S. defense consultant Jim McAleese.The Air Force last week named Pratt, a unit of United Technologies Corp, as the enginemaker for the new bomber, but gave no details about the actual engines. Pratt is also the supplier for the F135 engines that power the F-35 fighter jet built by Lockheed Martin Corp.Bogdan told the conference the bomber decision meant there could be an increase in production of the F135 engine cores, which could lead to price reductions later. ""There's spillover things that happen if you have two engines that are common,"" Bogdan said. ""There's another source of investment to improve engine manufacturing now.""He said he knew very little about the B-21 bomber program, which remains classified, and did not explicitly confirm that F135 engine cores would be used for the new bomber. Pratt spokesman Matthew Bates declined comment when asked if the the new bomber engine would use F135 engine cores.Bogdan said the Pentagon was likely to finalize by the end of the month a preliminary agreement reached in January with Pratt for 167 F135 engines under two contracts valued at more than $3 billion combined.He said the program also hoped to reach agreement in principle with Lockheed for a ninth batch of F-35 jets by the end of March, and a 10th batch of jets about a month later. The airframe deals are worth around $16 billion combined, he said.Bogdan said the F-35 program was continuing to drive down costs, but software challenges with the F-35's automated logistics system meant the Air Force could miss its Aug. 1 target date for an initial combat capability by 45 to 60 days.

The U.S. Defense Department has said it wants to build what it calls a ""prompt global strike"" capability that would enable it to hit targets worldwide within an hour with conventional or nuclear warheads.According to a report published by the Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies earlier this year, hypersonics had the potential to revolutionize the military much like stealth fighters did a generation ago.

Michael Gilmore, the Pentagon's chief weapons tester, said the program would not be ready for operational testing until mid-2018, a year later than expected, due to delays in completion of the jet's software and other issues. He said more than 300 planes would have been produced by the end of fiscal 2017, when that testing is now due to start. The software during flight test was not as stable as it needed to be, according to the statement by Sean Stackley, assistant secretary of the U.S. Navy, and Air Force Lieutenant General Christopher Bogdan, in charge of the F-35 program. ""We will be flight testing these fixes in the March-April timeframe,"" the statement said, adding that in testing the F-35C variant, cracking in part of the wing was found after a certain number of flying hours and efforts were being made to fix this.

976,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The Pentagon expects to award contracts for a $3 billion, six-year effort to upgrade its newest warplane, the Lockheed Martin Corp F-35 fighter jet, by the end of 2018, the Air Force general who runs the $391 billion program said on Wednesday.Lieutenant General Chris Bogdan rejected a call by the Government Accountability Office, the research arm of Congress, to make the $3 billion project into a separate weapons program.Michael Sullivan, director of defense weapons systems acquisition at GAO, told a hearing of the House Armed Services tactical and air land forces subcommittee that it would be difficult for Congress to oversee the upgrade unless it was carved out of the larger F-35 program.Lawmakers and independent watchdogs are anxious to keep tabs on the upgrade program after years of cost overruns and delays on the initial fighter jet program. U.S. officials said the F-35 program has made progress on cutting costs, schedule and technical issues since a major restructuring in 2010. Bogdan said the Defense Department would make every effort to ensure oversight and transparency of the modernization drive, which will give the jets improved capabilities.Bogdan said the Pentagon's chief arms buyer Frank Kendall would review the upgrade plans before allowing them to proceed, and the F-35 program office would also set up separate cost, schedule and performance metrics for the upgrade effort. Contractors will also have to set up separate systems to oversee their work on the new program. He said there were no plans to replace Lockheed as the prime contractor for the airplane, or Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp as the enginemaker.But Bogdan said the program would require a switch to a so-called open systems architecture by around 2023, which would make it easier to swap out sensors and other equipment on the aircraft in the future. He said the program would draw lessons from the Air Force's new B-21 long-range bomber program, which is being designed from the start with such an open architecture.  The Pentagon's Joint Requirements Oversight Council was expected to approve a document mapping out the upgrade plan for the F-35 this summer, Bogdan said, without giving details.Plans to make the F-35 capable of carrying nuclear weapons were also proceeding, with an eye to integrating the B61-12 weapon onto the Air Force's F-35A model in 2018, he said.

The jets have a service life of 8,000 hours, meaning they would be flying for an additional six years or 1.6 million flying hours, which in turn would add significant operating costs, Bogdan said. Barring that decision, he said, the program would have seen a $22 billion drop in operations and maintenance costs, with annual Navy and Air Force costs down between 2 to 4 percent due to the increasing maturity of the new warplane.Pentagon officials on Wednesday said the program had made steady improvements in cost, schedule and technical performance over the past year, but still faced delays in software development and a complex computer-based logistics system. Projected operating and maintenance costs, including inflation, are now seen up 10 percent to $1.12 trillion from $1.02 trillion in last year's report.But Bogdan dismissed the relevance of the long-term forecast for operating and maintenance costs, given the difficulty in forecasting fuel costs that far into the future.Lockheed is developing three models of the jet for the U.S. military and nine countries that have already placed orders: Britain, Italy, Turkey, the Netherlands, Norway, Australia, Japan, Israel and South Korea. In the statement, the program chief said the F-35A had a decrease in cost of $1.8 million per jet while the remaining two variants saw a decrease of approximately $1 million per jet.The Pentagon report forecast the average cost of the F-35A conventional takeoff and landing model would be $100.6 million, including inflation.

Lockheed is currently earning margins of 8 to 9 percent on the program and wants to boost its profits as it expands production, while the Pentagon is pressing the company to lower costs further.Lockheed has run into resistance from Northrop Grumman Corp , a key supplier to Lockheed on the program, which has refused to drop its prices significantly, said one of the sources.

997,"   By Irene Klotz | COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo.  COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. United Launch Alliance said on Wednesday its Atlas 5 rocket will need to be repaired before flights resume following an early engine shutdown on its last mission.“There will be corrective action,"" Tory Bruno, chief executive of the joint venture by Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing Co,told Reuters in an interview at the Space Symposium in Colorado Springs, Colorado.“I’m still confident that we’re going to get all the missions off within a year, but there’s going to be a little shuffling around,” Bruno said.ULA currently holds a monopoly on launching U.S. military and national security payloads.  The company’s next launch of a military communications satellite, MUOS-5, originally slated for May 5, has been delayed indefinitely, pending resolution of a problem that shut down an Atlas rocket first-stage engine 5.5 seconds early during its last flight on March 22, ULA said. The rocket’s second stage compensated for the shortfall, successfully delivering an Orbital ATK cargo ship into orbit for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The capsule later reached the International Space Station without incident.  ULA launched an immediate investigation into the premature engine shutdown. “Anytime anything happens on a rocket that’s not expected, we grind it to dust,” Bruno said.The problem involves the system that delivers kerosene fuel to the rocket’s Russian-made RD-180 first-stage engine. Bruno said he expects to know within the next few days which components are suspect.  Engineers have not found anything in the processing of the rocket for that launch on March 22 that was different from any previously flown, Bruno added.“We have a very good idea (of what the problem is), but we’re not quite done isolating it,” Bruno said. ""I think in the next few days we should be able to say which components ... we’re actually focused on.""

998,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON, April 14  WASHINGTON, April 14 A failure in the computer-based logistics system that serves as the ""brains"" of Lockheed Martin Corp's F-35 fighter jet could potentially ground the fleet because it lacks a back-up for processing data, according to a congressional report.The Government Accountability Office, the research arm of Congress, on Thursday released two reports on the $379 billion F-35 program, including one on the jet's $16.7 billion Autonomic Logistics Information System, or ALIS.The second report, on the overall health of the Pentagon's biggest weapons program, said acquisition costs had decreased since 2014 and manufacturing efficiency was improving, but the program still faces difficult software testing and big affordability challenges in coming years.ALIS supports everything from the plane's operations, pilot scheduling, mission planning and supply chain management to maintenance, making it one of the three major components of the jet, along with the airframe and engine. The Pentagon's F-35 program manager, Air Force Lieutenant General Chris Bogdan, has repeatedly cited concerns about ALIS, which is so large it could be a separate arms program.The GAO report recommended the Pentagon develop a holistic plan to address myriad issues with ALIS to ensure that the most pressing problems are resolved before the start of full production, instead of dealing with issues on a piecemeal basis. It also cited a Pentagon-commissioned study from 2013 that found any delays or problems with ALIS could drive the cost of the overall F-35 program up by $20 billion to $100 billion.GAO said one of the biggest concerns raised by 120 F-35 pilots, maintenance staff, contractors and program officials interviewed for the report was the lack of a redundant system for processing ALIS data. Reliance on a single point of entry for all ALIS data and a single main ALIS operating unit in Fort Worth, Texas, means a weather-related loss of electricity or other failure could affect fleet operations or even ground it, GAO said.Pentagon officials told GAO they recognized the risk and were in the early stages of trying to buy up to two more ALIS operating units for back-up, though no funds had been allocated for that purpose.The report also raised concerns about lack of testing of a new, more deployable version of ALIS, the inability of the system to communicate with systems used to support older fighter jets and continuing information security concerns.

""As a result of our adversaries closing the technology gap, and increasing demand from allies and partners for high-performance, multi-role aircraft to meet evolving and worsening global security threats, the committee believes that the prospect of restarting the F-22 production line is worthy of further exploration,” Turner said in a statement on Wednesday.The committee is asking for the report by Jan. 1, 2017.

Kendall and Air Force Lieutenant General Christopher Bogdan, the program executive officer for the F-35, told a Senate Armed Service Committee hearing in written testimony that the cause of the problem was the timing of “software messages from the sensors to the main F-35” computer. They added that stability issues had improved to where the sensors only needed to be restarted after more than 10 hours.“We are cautiously optimistic that these fixes will resolve the current stability problems, but are waiting to see how the software performs in an operational test environment,” the officials said in a written statement.    The statement added that a team of experts from the Navy and Air Force has been created to “develop recommendations to ensure the F-35 software is robust and resilient into the future.”The F-35 program had hoped to declare the Air Force version of the high-tech fighter ready for combat by Aug. 1, but Bogdan said difficulties with the plane's Autonomic Logistics Information System meant ""initial operational capability"" would likely be delayed by about 60 days. The system is the plane's main information infrastructure, integrating its operations, maintenance, prognostics, supply chain, training and other data. Despite that likely delay, Bogdan said the Air Force F-35 would still reach its initial operating capability by the threshold date of Dec. 1.Lockheed is developing three models of the jet, also known as the Joint Strike Fighter, or Lightning II.

""We plan to reduce risks through demonstrations and pathfinders and will rigorously analyze alternatives,"" said Lieutenant General Samuel Greaves, who heads the Air Force's Space and Missile Systems Center.""The intent is to verify if multiple GPS 3 satellite vehicle sources exist,"" the Air Force added.Lockheed took over the GPS manufacturing work from Boeing in 2008 and is currently building the first eight GPS 3 satellites in a planned network of 32. Negotiations for two more satellites from Lockheed are expected to begin this summer. The program is more than two years behind schedule, primarily due to problems with the satellite's navigation payload, developed by Exelis Corp, which is now owned by Harris Corp. The first GPS 3 satellite is now scheduled for launch in 2017.The delay has increased the cost of the first eight satellites from $4.1 billion to $4.4 billion, according to a March 2014 Government Accountability Office report. It also prompted the Air Force to ask industry to consider developing competing designs.

""We have asked the Danish Ministry of Defence to reassess its evaluation of the cost. We think their report has made the cost of the Super Hornet 50-100 per cent more expensive than in reality,"" Boeing vice president Debbie Rub told Reuters. The ministry report evaluating each fighter jet candidate was based on data estimating that the Super Hornet would have a service life of 6,000 flying hours, while Boeing thinks the right figure for Denmark is 9,500 hours.The report also compared a one-seater fighter jet F35 to a two-seater rather than a one-seater Super Hornet, Debbie Rub told Reuters. Danish defense minister Peter Christensen told Danish broadcaster TV2 that Boeing's critique would not change the government's recommendation to buy Lockheed Martin's F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. The report concluded that the total cost of the F-35 jet is 42.2 billion Danish crowns ($6.4 billion) while the Super Hornet would cost 60.6 billion crowns.

1033,"  (Recasts, adds details)BERLIN May 31 Germany is not considering cancelling the troubled Airbus Group SE A400M programme but is looking at acquiring other transport planes since the A400M cannot land at small airports, German government sources said on Tuesday.The government expects to deal with a temporary bottleneck in 2018 and 2019, caused by A400M production delays, through leasing and other bilateral solutions with France, Britain and the United States, the sources said.The government is also exploring leasing capacity from other countries, or perhaps joint purchase and operating agreements with allies, to augment its expected fleet of 53 A400M planes, the sources said. Outright procurement of other planes by the German military would also be possible if other plans did not work out, they said.The sources gave no details about which aircraft would be sought, but German parliamentary and military sources said in March that the German air force was looking at potentially acquiring up to 10 C-130J aircraft built by Lockheed Martin Corp . Lockheed had no immediate comment.German government sources said Airbus, Europe's largest aerospace company, expected to deliver four to six A400M aircraft to the German military this year. Germany has ordered 53 of the planes from Airbus, but only three planes have been delivered so far due to production delays caused in part by gearbox glitches on the plane's turboprop engines.However, neither Airbus nor enginemaker MTU Aero Engines AG  expect that current issues with the A400M engine will necessitate a major redesign of the engine, the sources said.Airbus Chief Executive Tom Enders told German newspaper Bild am Sonntag this week that a lack of quality at the MTU turboprop engine consortium for the A400M was one of the main reasons for delays in the programme.

1035,"   By Andrea Shalal | BERLIN, June 1  BERLIN, June 1 Lockheed Martin Corp said on Wednesday it is seeing some encouraging signs in the commercial helicopter market after last year's slump in demand from oil and gas companies as the sector grappled with a collapse in oil prices.Nathalie Previte, vice president of sales and marketing for Sikorsky, a unit of Lockheed, said in an interview during the Berlin airshow that she expected flat demand for commercial helicopters this year, with analysts forecasting a return to growth in 2017.Previte said Sikorsky had expected a sharp drop in flight hours in the sector in 2015, given a number of contract cancellations, but that flight hours actually rose by 1 percent in the year ended December 2015. In addition, she said Sikorsky had won several tenders in the sector this year, including two deals in Norway, one in Asia and several others that she could not identify due to customers' security concerns. The deals do not necessarily represent new helicopter sales, but they keep Sikorsky helicopters flying in the sector, she said.""So far this year, we have had great success in these competitions,"" Previte said, noting that the price of oil was also rising slowly. Previte's remarks come amid continued questions about whether Lockheed paid too much for its $9 billion Sikorsky takeover last year given the slump in oil prices and the resulting drop in sales of commercial helicopters used to ferry workers to offshore oil rigs. Previte cautioned against reading too much into the positive news given residual issues in that market, including large excess capacities.Steve O'Bryan, who heads business development for Lockheed's mission systems and training business, said he also saw  opportunities for Sikorsky to sell more search and rescue helicopters, as well as VIP transports.The company expected to land another large VIP transport order from an Asian country this summer, O'Bryan said, without providing any details.

1037,"   By Andrea Shalal | BERLIN, June 1  BERLIN, June 1 Lockheed Martin Corp aims to sweeten Sikorsky's bid to build 50 helicopters for Poland if Warsaw scraps a $3 billion plan to buy the helicopters from Airbus Group SE, a senior Lockheed executive told Reuters on Wednesday.Steve O'Bryan, head of business development for Lockheed's mission systems and training business, which includes Sikorsky, said a new bid would include weapons, combat training and pricing in the Polish currency, all elements that were not included in Sikorsky's original bid.He said Lockheed's acquisition of Sikorsky last year provided opportunities to strengthen the proposal. ""We're better together,"" O'Bryan told Reuters in an interview, underscoring the benefit of bidding as a newly joined unit.As well as boosting Poland's defence industry, buying Sikorsky helicopters could further strengthen Warsaw's ties with Washington, already its closest ally, and could help secure U.S. backing for Poland's demands for a stronger NATO presence on the alliance's eastern flank. Lockheed officials have said they are standing by to work with the new Polish government if it decides to cancel the Airbus order placed by the previous government, and even have pre-built Black Hawk helicopters on hand if needed.Earlier this year, a Polish deputy defence minister said the deal with Airbus was likely to be scrapped. Members of the new government have said they would rather see the deal awarded to a company that builds the helicopters locally. Both Sikorsky and AgustaWestland, a unit of Italy's Leonardo, formerly known as Finmecccanica SpA, have facilities in Poland. Airbus would source work on its helicopters in Poland, but Polish officials have said the aircraft would mostly be built in France.Lockheed will also display a Black Hawk helicopter built in Poland during large-scale bilateral U.S.-Polish military exercises planned in Poland next month, company officials said. Other Black Hawk helicopters will fly in the exercise, company officials said. This will take place shortly before a NATO summit in Warsaw in July, where Poland is expected to seek a greater allied presence on its territory.O'Bryan said it was increasingly important for weapons makers to involve local industry, ensure some technology transfer and help build lasting domestic industries when competing for large arms sales today, unlike the shorter term ""offset programs"" favoured in the past.Poland's previous centrist government, beaten by the eurosceptic Law and Justice (PiS) party in elections last October, agreed a provisional deal with Airbus for 50 EC-725 Caracal multi-purpose helicopters.But the negotiations have dragged on, and Polish media have reported the government may scrap all but a few of the orders.

1042,"  COPENHAGEN The Danish government reached an agreement on Thursday with coalition parties to proceed with the purchase of 27 F-35A stealth fighter jets from U.S. defense company Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N), the defense ministry said.The decision follows a May 12 announcement by Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen, who leads a minority government, supporting the acquisition of 27 fighter jets worth 20 billion Danish crowns ($3.1 billion), in line with a recommendation from an expert group appointed by the government.The coalition expects to phase in the new radar-evading fighters between 2021-2026, with the first four to be delivered in 2021, six in 2022 and the remainder between 2023 and 2026, the defense ministry said. The agreement marks a further gain for Lockheed, and comes just days before the F-35, the world's largest weapons project, is due to make its international air show premiere at Leeuwarden Air Base in the Netherlands on Saturday.Lockheed welcomed the news and said it would continue to work with the U.S. government and the Pentagon's F-35 joint program office to support Denmark's procurement of the jets.It said it would continue to work with Danish industry to map out possible supplier agreements for production and maintenance of the new jets.

""The projected industrial opportunities with the F-35 will bring long term economic benefits to Denmark for decades to come,"" Lockheed said in a statement.Denmark's decision deals a blow to rival Boeing Co (BA.N) which mounted an expensive last-ditch marketing effort for its older F/A-18E/F Super Hornet.

1045,"   By Andrea Shalal | BERLIN  BERLIN Top U.S. weapons maker Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) is studying whether to shift work on its multibillion-dollar F-35 fighter jet away from Canadian firms amid uncertainty over Ottawa's plans to buy the jet. Jack Crisler, Lockheed's vice president of business development for the F-35 program, told Reuters Lockheed was under pressure from other partner countries that had placed firm orders or accelerated orders to shift more work to them. ""This is not anything punitive. It is just business,"" he said in a telephone interview from the Netherlands, where the F-35 will fly in its first international air show on Saturday.Canadian firms will account for development and production work on the F-35 program worth about $1 billion by the end of 2016, Crisler said.But future work could be in jeopardy if Canada decides to skip a competition and order F/A-18E/F fighter jets built by rival Boeing Co (BA.N), as indicated by recent Canadian media reports, he said. A spokeswoman for Canada's defense ministry said the reports were not accurate, but gave no further information.Crisler said Lockheed had been unable to secure a meeting with the Canadian government to discuss the issue. He said F-35 supply chain contracts were competitively awarded in rough proportion to the purchase plans of the nine original partner countries that helped fund development of the radar-evading jet: the United States, Britain, Canada, Turkey, Italy, Norway, the Netherlands, Australia and Denmark.Canada's ruling Liberals won an election last October on a promise not to buy F-35s because the planes were too expensive. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told the House of Commons the opposition Conservatives had ""clung to a plane that does not work and is far from being able to work.""Joe DellaVedova, a spokesman for the Pentagon's F-35 office, said Canada remained a partner in the $379 billion program, and U.S. officials continued to provide the Canadian government information about the jets as they decided how to proceed. More than 180 of the new jets are now flying, including an initial squadron of U.S. Marine Corps F-35 jets that were declared ready for combat a year ago, he said.Crisler said if Canada held an open competition, Lockheed would retain contracts with Canadian firms, but it would need to rethink if Ottawa opted for a sole-source deal with Boeing. ""We are evaluating all that now,"" he said. ""The most important thing is that we've got to protect the enterprise as we get ready to ramp up production.""However, in a note to clients on Friday, Macquarie analyst Konark Gupta questioned Lockheed's rhetoric, noting that the company recently awarded long-term F-35 contracts to another Canadian supplier.    ""(This) suggests to us that Lockheed could simply be threatening Canada to win an F-35 order,"" Gupta wrote.Sixty Canadian firms had worked on the F-35 development program, and 70 others are now involved in production of the jets, including Magellan Aerospace (MAL.TO), Crisler said.  Canadian firms involved urged Ottawa on Thursday to hold a fair and open competition to replace its aging fleet of CF-18 fighter jets. Their supply contracts, they wrote in the joint statement, were contingent on Canada buying the F-35.""Not selecting the F-35 will set off a chain of events that will see hundreds of millions of investment dollars lost, and high-tech jobs leaving Canada, going to countries who are buying the F-35,"" they said.

1060,"  (Adds further details)By Andrea ShalalRAF FAIRFORD, England, July 7 Lockheed Martin Corp said on Thursday it expected to reach an agreement soon with the U.S. Defense Department about contracts for the next 160 F-35 radar-evading fighter jets, two long-awaited deals valued at around $15 billion.Jeff Babione, Lockheed's F-35 programme manager, told reporters he was ""very, very encouraged"" by the discussions about the ninth and 10th contracts, which are being conducted in tandem, and expected to finalise a deal with the Pentagon soon.Babione said the price of the F-35A conventional takeoff and landing version of the multi-role jet would drop to under $100 million per plane in the 10th low-rate production batch. That includes an engine built by Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp. ""I know it's going to be less, it's just how much less,"" he said. He said Lockheed was still working to drive the price of the jets down to around $85 million by 2019.Six of the F-35 Lightning IIs will fly this week at the Royal International Air Tattoo near Fairford, England, the world's largest military airshow, along with a U.S. Air Force F-22 Raptor, also built by Lockheed, the Pentagon's largest supplier. The F-35 had been due to make its international premiere at the same air show two years ago, but those plans were scrapped after an engine failure grounded the overall F-35 fleet.Two F-35s made their premier appearance at an international air show in the Netherlands last month after carrying out a series of tests that officials said showed that the new stealthy jets were no noisier than previous jets. Babione said the program had come a long way in the past two years, with more than 180 F-35s now flying and the U.S. Air Force poised to declare an initial squadron ready for combat between August and December.A year ago the U.S. Marine Corps declared as ready for combat its first squadron of F-35Bs, the short take-off and vertical landing version. It plans to deploy that first squadron to a U.S. air base in Iwakuni, Japan early next year.Babione said Lockheed was ready to invest an additional $60 million to $100 million in new technologies or changes that can further lower the cost of the jets under a program called Blueprint for Affordability.The first phase of that program involved investments of $170 million by Lockheed and primary development partners Northrop Grumman Corp and BAE Systems Plc.

1062,"  RAF FAIRFORD, England Data about Pratt & Whitney's F135 engine will be integrated into the computerized logistics system used to service the Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) F-35 fighter jet by November, the president of Pratt's military engines business said on Friday.Pratt, a unit of United Technologies Corp (UTX.N), has been providing data about the engine to Lockheed software engineers, and is standing by to test the new software, Bennett Croswell, who heads the Pratt unit, told Reuters in an interview.Lockheed's F-35 fighter jet is seeing marked improvements after years of technical issues and cost overruns, but the jet's highly complex Autonomic Logistics Information System, or ALIS, has continued to prove challenging, officials say.Adding the engine data will mark a key milestone for the system, which includes more lines of software code than the actual jet.  U.S. Marine Corps and Air Force officials told reporters at the Royal International Air Tattoo, the world's largest military airshow, that the ALIS system still needed work, but was already performing well enough to support deployments of aircraft. Marine Corps Lieutenant General Jon Davis, deputy commandant for aviation, said the current version of ALIS had worked fine since the Marines declared an initial squadron of jets combat-ready a year ago.""Our turnaround times are within reason,"" he said, referring to the system's ability to facilitate repairs and maintenance of the jets. ""It's not slowing us down at all.""  Croswell said engine data was available to F-35 technicians outside the ALIS system, and even at-sea deployments of the aircraft had gone smoothly without the engine data being fully integrated into the ALIS system.Lockheed now expects to complete the new software version of ALIS - which is due to include the engine data - by October or November, instead of August, as initially planned. U.S. Air Force General Hawk Carlisle, who heads Air Combat Command, on Monday said software delays in the ALIS system were ""not a limiting factor"" in his decision on whether to declare an initial squadron of F-35 jets ready for combat.

He declined to say if the move would happen by Aug. 1, the target set by the Pentagon's F-35 chief.He said delays in completion of the latest software for the F-35's computerized logistic system were ""not a limiting factor"" in his decision, since the current software worked during a recent test deployment from one Air Force base to another. The new software package for the jet's Autonomic Logistics Information System, or ALIS, is now expected to be completed in October or November, instead of August as expected, but Carlisle said the current version was sufficient to support a deployment.""There's nothing really red that's really limited us at all,"" Carlisle told reporters, referring to the U.S. military's practice of using traffic-light symbols to help evaluate risks to programs. ""I'm very confident in this airplane, and where we're heading,"" he added. Carlisle, speaking on the eve of the Royal International Air Tattoo, the world's largest military air show, said he was pleased by the aircraft's performance during a deployment to the second air base. The jets carried out all 88 missions planned during the deployment, he said.Jeff Babione, Lockheed's F-35 programme manager, said the decision was up to the Air Force, but Lockheed had delivered the airplanes required for the first operational squadron. The U.S. Marine Corps declared its first squadron of radar-evading F-35 fighter jets ready for combat a year ago.Carlisle said the IOC declaration meant the Air Force could use the jets for combat deployments to the Middle East or elsewhere if needed.He said the Air Force planned to continue rotating its F-22 fighter jets and other assets, including the F-35 fighter jet, through Europe. An initial deployment for the F-35 was likely planned in fiscal 2017, he said.

He said all the major issues had been resolved and the fate of the deal was largely in Lockheed's hands at the moment.Lockheed's F-35 program manager Jeff Babione had told reporters on Thursday that he expected to reach an agreement soon about contracts for the ninth and 10th production contracts for the new warplane.

Buying larger numbers of jets at a time -- starting with the 12th production batch of jets -- could generate savings of $2 billion to $2.8 billion, even if the U.S. military was not able to join in until it got congressional approval, he said. The U.S. military services would likely join in starting with the 13th and 14th production lots, which would reduce the initially anticipated savings by ""hundreds of millions of dollars,"" he said. Bogdan told reporters the program office was carefully assessing any potential impact on trade and tariffs stemming from Britain's vote to leave the European Union, but the initial expectation was that it would not have much impact.A drop in the value of the British pound could help lower some costs, since 15 percent of the jet is built by UK firms.

1070,"   By Andrea Shalal | FARNBOROUGH, England  FARNBOROUGH, England The U.S. Defense Department on Monday extended by two years a  project that has cut the cost of Lockheed Martin Corp's (LMT.N) F-35 fighter plane by more than $1 million per jet, and kicked off a similar project to cut operating and maintenance costs.The Pentagon's F-35 program office is working closely with industry to drive down the cost of the jets - now running just over $100 million per jet - to around $85 million by 2019.The F-35 program is the Pentagon's costliest arms program. The U.S. military plans to spend $379 billion to buy a total of 2,457 F-35 warplanes over the next decades.Under the Blueprint for Affordability cost-cutting program first announced two years ago, Lockheed and its key suppliers, Northrop Grumman Corp (NOC.N) and Britain's BAE Systems Plc (BAES.L) were due to invest $170 million in new technologies, materials and processes to lower production costs.They are due to recoup their initial outlays from the government once the accrued savings are verified. Specific programs included boosting efficiency through improved tooling, automating production by introducing robotics, and even modifying assembly instructions. The project funded 193 separate initiatives, of which 75 were still in process. The investments are expected to save $1.15 million per aircraft in the ninth production lot, and $1.7 million in the 10th. Over the life of the program, the changes will save around $4 billion, according to the F-35 program.Over the next two years, the companies have agreed to invest $24 million left over from the original program, and up to $170 million more on continued work to lower the cost of the jets, the program office said.In addition, the three companies agreed to invest up to $250 million in projects aimed at cutting the cost of operating and maintaining the jets, with a goal of saving $1 billion over a five-year period, the F-35 program office said. Pentagon acquisition chief Frank Kendall said the extra  investment by industry would help the military bridge to an F-35 block purchase planned in coming years for international customers that could cut the cost of building the jets by over $2 billion.Kendall told reporters that the department was ""basically ready to move forward"" on the block buy, initially with a group of other countries, and then later with the U.S. military.""We’d like to see that proceed as soon as possible,"" he said. ""We think we’re basically ready to move forward on that."" Kendall said the separate program to cut operating costs would help the Pentagon achieve its goal of lowering the overall lifecycle cost of the program - now estimated to be over $1 trillion through 2070 - by 30 percent.Bennett Croswell, who heads the military engines business of Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies which makes the F135 engine that powers the F-35, said his company would also set new cost-cutting targets after completing the engine's development program by the end of this month.He said the new program would involve Britain's Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc (RR.L), which makes the lift fan for the F-35B model, which can land vertically like a helicopter.

Edwards said it was possible that contract negotiations with the German government about the Medium Extended Air Defense System, or MEADS, could slip into early next year, as suggested by the German defense ministry document. But he said lawmakers could still approve the deal as long as it was done in the first three months of the year, before the German national election cycle kicks off in earnest ahead of the September vote. ""I think it’s important that it get done by the first quarter of next year before we get into the German election cycle,"" Edwards said.  ""But as much as I want to be under contract by December, I don’t think there’s anything magic about (that date).""Raytheon, maker of the rival Patriot missile defense system, said the comments in the ministry document were a sign parliamentary approval could slip until 2018 and it still hoped Germany's decision to buy the MEADS system instead of Patriot could be reversed. MEADS would be one of the first big arms programs to fall under new German acquisition laws, which would complicate  discussions about an already complex program. But Edwards said that had been clear to the companies involved for some time.He said Lockheed was supporting MBDA as it finalised the MEADS proposal, and the recent departure of MBDA Managing Director Thomas Homberg for health reasons should not affect the process.

1079,"   By Andrea Shalal | FARNBOROUGH, England  FARNBOROUGH, England The U.S. Air Force has developed a new framework for assessing the resilience of its satellites that should allow it to start the acquisition process for more military communication and missile detection satellites this autumn, a senior official said at the Farnborough Airshow this week.Lockheed Martin, Boeing Co, Northrop Grumman Corp and Raytheon Co are keeping a close eye on these satellite programs, which could be worth billions of dollars and represent the first big new business opportunities in the military space market for some time.U.S. officials have grown increasingly concerned about the need to protect their military satellites - which are critical to being able to identify targets, navigate, communicate and operate drones - given the growing use of electronic jammers and other threats.Winston Beauchamp, the U.S. Air Force deputy undersecretary for space, told Reuters that officials had developed a new set of criteria over the past year to help military leaders determine their options for more satellites. The Air Force had previously looked at the options for follow-on satellites in both programs but until now had not included specific criteria for their resilience, or their ability to operate in the face of ""hostile action or adverse conditions,” such as electromagnetic interference.Beauchamp said senior Pentagon leaders last week endorsed the work done so far on the framework and further work planned before it is presented to Defense Secretary Ash Carter for approval in the fall. Once that decision is made, the Air Force hopes to begin the long-awaited acquisition process to buy follow-on satellites for the Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) system built by Lockheed Martin for protected satellite communications, and new missile warning satellites, also currently built by Lockheed under the Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS) program.Work was already underway on the acquisition strategy for each of the two programs so they could begin shortly after the resilience decision this autumn, Beauchamp said. The U.S. Air Force was also focused on increasing coordination and planning among allies for its space operations, as well as more multilateral wargaming and work on developing rules of engagement and joint concepts of operations.""We are thinking more broadly about how to conduct operations in a joint manner,"" Beauchamp said. ""In the past it was tacked on at the end. But we'd like to find a way to shift the planning to the left in a number of areas.""

1085,"   By Tim Kelly and Nobuhiro Kubo | TOKYO  TOKYO Japan is upgrading its Patriot PAC-3 missile defense system in time for the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games, adding range and accuracy needed to intercept more advanced North Korean ballistic missiles, four sources with knowledge of the plan said.The move represents the most significant upgrade to Japan's missile defense system in a decade and is part of an increase in military spending in the region, where geopolitical tensions are rising. The rollout of the new advanced Missile Segment Enhancement, which could double the range of the current PAC-3 missiles to around 30 km (19 miles), will likely start next year, said the sources, who were not authorized to speak publicly about the project. ""The upgraded PAC-3 is necessary to counter the Musudan,"" said one source, referring to Pyongyang's intermediate-range ballistic missile. North Korea in June test-fired what appeared to be two Musudan rockets. The first failed, but the second traveled 400 km (250 miles), more than halfway towards the southwest coast of Japan and reached a height of 1,000 km - enough altitude to give its warhead a range of more than 3,000 km (1,800 miles).Experts said that test represented a technological advance for the Pyongyang regime, which is also developing nuclear weapons. It puts it one step closer to being able to lob a warhead that could plunge to its target at speeds of several kilometers a second, potentially too fast for the current PAC-3 batteries that are the last line of defense against missile strikes.South Korea's military operates the older PAC-2 system and has a program to replace it with the PAC-3 system by 2018, a South Korean defense ministry official said. U.S. forces based in the country were also planning to upgrade their PAC-3 batteries covering the capital Seoul, the official added.  RISING TENSIONS  Along with North Korea's missile and nuclear tests, tensions in Asia are being fueled by ongoing territorial disputes between China and Japan in the East China Sea, and between China and several Southeast Asian nations in the South China Sea. China is swiftly modernizing its armed forces, in part to counter what it sees as a strategy of containment in the United States' Asian ""pivot"".A spokesman for Japan's Defence Ministry said ""nothing has been decided"" on the PAC-3 upgrade. The International Olympic Committee's decision to grant Tokyo the 2020 games will help unlock funding for the PAC-3 upgrade despite military budget constraints, the sources told Reuters. Around 100 billion yen ($955 million) in funding would be requested in the next defense budget proposal for the year starting April 2017, one of the sources said. Funding will need cabinet approval before going into the national budget and additional funds would have to be approved for subsequent years.Japan is also considering purchasing the advanced Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD, anti-missile system, which Washington and Seoul agreed to deploy in South Korea earlier this month. That decision sparked a complaint from China, which said it would destabilize the regional security balance.The Patriot upgrade would likely be an enhancement to Japan's ballistic missile defense, rather than an alternative to THAAD or a similar system. Japan also has Aegis-equipped destroyers patrolling the Sea of Japan that are loaded with interceptor missiles designed to hit incoming projectiles. It is currently developing a new version dubbed the Standard Missile 3 (SM-3) with the United States designed to destroy ballistic warheads in space, although no decision on a roll out has yet been made.The PAC-3 system was developed by Lockheed Martin Corp and Raytheon Co. Japan's biggest defense contractor, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI), will begin work on Japan's systems under license after April next year, the sources said.MHI will upgrade 12 batteries in the first year, another 12 the following year with four in the subsequent twelve months, the sources said. Those guarding the Tokyo area will take priority and some used for training will not be upgraded.""The Ministry of Defence has not made any announcement regarding this, so as a commercial company we are not in a position to comment,"" a MHI spokeswoman said.Raytheon did not immediately respond to a request for comment, while a Lockheed spokeswoman said the company had ""a long and successful history of working with Japanese industry in their production of the PAC-3 missile system under license”.

1100,"   By Andrea Shalal | BERLIN  BERLIN The United States on Wednesday began notifying lawmakers that it has approved $7 billion in long-stalled sales of Boeing Co (BA.N) fighter jets to Kuwait and Qatar, and more than $1 billion in Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) jets to Bahrain, sources familiar with the decision said.The sales had been pending for more than two years amid concerns raised by Israel, Washington's closest Middle East ally, that arms sold to Gulf Arab states could be used against it, and criticism of Qatar for alleged ties to armed Islamist groups.U.S. officials began notifying lawmakers informally about the sale of 36 Boeing F-15 fighter jets to Qatar valued at around $4 billion, and 28 F/A- 18E/F Super Hornets, plus options for 12 more, to Kuwait for around $3 billion, the sources said.They also told lawmakers about plans to sell 17 Lockheed F-16 fighter jets to Bahrain, plus upgrades of up to 20 additional aircraft.The deals will be formally announced once the 40-day informal notification process has ended. Then lawmakers will have 30 days to block the sales, although such action is rare.Reuters reported earlier this month that the U.S. government was poised to approve the long-delayed sales to Kuwait and Qatar.The State Department said it could not comment on any ongoing government-to-government arms sales. Delays in the process had caused frustration among U.S. defense officials and industry executives, who warned that Washington’s foot-dragging could cost them billions of dollars of business if buyers grew impatient and sought other suppliers.The approval of the fighter jet sales comes as the White House tries to bolster relations with Gulf Arab allies who want to upgrade their military capabilities. They fear the United States is drawing closer to Iran, their arch-rival, after Tehran's nuclear deal with world powers last year.Sources said officials at both the State Department and Pentagon had largely agreed to the deals some time ago, but had been awaiting final approval from the White House.Qatar, home to the largest U.S. air base in the Middle East, and Kuwait have ramped up military spending after uprisings across the Arab world and amid rising tensions between Sunni Muslim Gulf Arab states and Iran, the region's Shi'ite power. Both Qatar and Kuwait are part of a 34-nation alliance announced by Saudi Arabia in December aimed at countering Islamic State and al Qaeda militants in Iraq, Syria, Libya, Egypt and Afghanistan.The sales will boost fighter production for both companies.Boeing's F-15 line is set to close in 2019 after Boeing completes work on a large order for Saudi Arabia, unless a follow-on order is approved.

1106,"  (Adds Airbus C295 refuelling trials, last 2 paragraphs)By Sabine Siebold and Andrea ShalalBERLIN Oct 5 Germany is looking at buying 4-6 new Lockheed Martin C-130J troop transport planes and operating them jointly with France, placing a further dent in plans for a fully European airlift capability based on the delayed A400M.German Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen and her French counterpart, Jean-Yves Le Drian, signed an agreement in Paris late on Tuesday to study a joint tactical airlift pool of C-130J aircraft, the German defence ministry said.The latest initiative in Franco-German defence co-operation comes against the backdrop of tough negotiations with Airbus Military over delays to the A400M, as well as growing European concerns over a possible shift in UK defence priorities away from its continental partners following the Brexit vote.France is already in the process of buying four C-130J aircraft from Lockheed partly to allow refuelling of helicopters used by its special forces, a feature originally meant to be supplied by the A400M but abandoned for technical reasons. ""We expect considerable synergies from such a move,"" Markus Grubel, parliamentary state secretary in the German defence ministry, told lawmakers in a letter about the C-130J purchase.There has been speculation that Germany could buy used C-130J aircraft from Britain to help meet near-term needs.But a German defence ministry source said Berlin would buy up to six new aircraft directly from the United States. Such a deal could be worth close to half a billion euros, based on the 330 million euros ($370 million) budgeted by France for its earlier purchase of four C-130Js.""Current plans call for the procurement of new aircraft. There are no specific timelines for that purchase,"" a defence ministry source said.The German-French agreement foresees the new joint tactical airlift capability being operational by 2021, but it is not certain Germany will have all its C-130Js by then. Von der Leyen told Reuters last week Germany would make a decision soon on acquiring C-130s to cover what Berlin views as a gap in capabilities once the elderly Transall leaves service in 2021.Germany is the largest customer for the A400M, initially developed for seven European NATO nations at a cost of 20 billion euros but mired in delays and heavy cost overruns.Airbus declined to comment on Germany's C-130 proposals, but sought to dampen the political attention being given to its rival warplane by announcing separately that it had carried out successful trials of its C295 turboprop as a refuelling tanker.The company, partly owned by the French and German governments, had lobbied France in vain to reject the C-130 for its special forces and to take the Spanish-built C295 instead.($1 = 0.8921 euros)   (Additional reporting by Tim Hepher; Editing by Elaine Hardcastle and Mark Potter)",2016-10-05,LMT,"Wed Oct 5, 2016 | 11:43am EDT",UPDATE 1-Germany looks into buying new Lockheed transport planes,http://www.reuters.com//article/lockheed-germany-france-idUSL5N1CB4OQ?type=companyNews

1111,"   By Tim Kelly | TOKYO  TOKYO Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) wants Japan to do more work on the F-35 program after earlier attempts to tempt Japanese companies such as Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (7011.T) with component supply contracts failed, a senior Lockheed executive said.""There are industrial opportunities that are still available for Japan. The action is on their side of the ledger right now,"" Steve Over, director of international business development for the F-35 program, said in an interview at the Japan Aerospace 2016 show in Tokyo.Japan has ordered 42 F-35 to replace its fleet of aging F-4s. Most of those will be put together by Mitsubishi Heavy at a final assembly and check out plant in Japan.Japan's government and its companies declined to join the F-35 build at the start of the program as constraints on arms exports at the time meant they could not make components for defense equipment that would be used by foreign militaries.  Prime Minister Shinto Abe's government lifted that export ban in April 2014, but it was too late for Japanese industry to join the F-35 as top tier profit sharing partner. Subsequent talks for Mitsubishi Heavy to supply aft fuselage parts for BAE Systems Plc (BAES.L), one of the F-35 partners, fell through without agreement.Japan, Over said, could still do that fuselage work or bid for other contracts if it wants to.  ""In our heart and soul we would like to have more opportunity in Japan.""Getting Japan more involved in the F-35 could bolster Lockheed's chance of selling more of the stealth fighters to Japan.

Northrop Grumman Corp (NOC.N) and Raytheon Co (RTN.N) are due to report quarterly results later this week.The company said third-quarter sales in its rotary and mission systems business unit jumped 55 percent to $3.35 billion, which included about $1.2 billion from sales of Sikorsky military and commercial helicopters. Lockheed completed the $9 billion acquisition of Sikorsky from United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) last year.Lockheed said sales in its aeronautics business, the  biggest division, increased 6.8 percent due to higher net sales of approximately $300 million for the F-35 jet program due to higher aircraft production and sustainment activities.  Only 10 F-35 aircraft were produced this quarter compared with 12 for the same period last year. On their quarterly results conference call, management said a problem with the insulation in the F-35's fuel lines and fuel tanks, and the subsequent fix for aircraft still on the production line, was the reason for ""lighter"" F-35 deliveries this quarter.Lockheed is developing and building F-35s for the U.S. military and eight other countries. With estimated development and procurement costs of $391 billion for the United States alone, the F-35 is the world's most expensive weapons program.Lockheed's space systems division, the third largest unit at the Bethesda, Maryland-based company, delivered $185 million in additional operating profit for the quarter, a 70 percent increase over the same period last year. According to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S calculations, the company's income from continuing operations was $3.27 per share, versus the average analyst estimate of $2.87. Net income more than doubled to $2.40 billion, or $7.93 per share, in the third quarter ended Sept. 25, from $865 million, or $2.77 per share, a year earlier.""Most investors who take a look at the trading chart will conclude that this result is more than enough for a stock that has underperformed sharply of late,"" Barclays analyst Carter Copeland said in a research note. Lockheed's net income included a one-time special cash payment of $1.8 billion from the company's $5 billion tax-free deal to merge its information systems and global solutions business with Leidos Holdings Inc (LDOS.N) earlier this year.The company said it expected 2017 net sales to increase by 7 percent compared to 2016. The company also said it expected business segment operating margins to be between 10 and 10.5 percent.Lockheed raised its adjusted outlook 2016 profit forecast of $11.15 to $11.45 per share to $12.10 and said its forecast for adjusted sales of $45 billion to $46.2 billion had been raised to $46.5 billion.Net sales rose to $11.55 billion from $10.06 billion a year earlier.

1126,"   By Allison Lampert | OTTAWA  OTTAWA The operator of Lockheed Martin Corp's (LMT.N) blimp-like hybrid airships on Wednesday announced its first customer, a Canadian mining company that expects to lease seven of the heavy-lift cargo aircraft for a decade starting in 2019.Quest Rare Minerals Ltd (QRM.TO) will lease the airships from operator Straightline Aviation in the first commercial use deal for the airships, which are filled mostly with helium, said Hybrid Enterprises LLC, which sells the aircraft for Lockheed.Quest signed a memorandum of understanding with Straightline  on the sidelines of a Canadian aerospace conference. The deal between Straightline and Quest is valued at US$850 million, including fuel costs, over the 10-year period.   Lockheed, the U.S. Defense Department's No. 1 supplier, has said the airships will revolutionize the way oil and mining companies haul equipment to the Arctic and other remote areas without roads. They can move 20 tons of cargo and set down on nearly any flat surface, including sand, snow and water, the company said. Quest is in the early stages of developing a rare earth metal project in northern Quebec and does not yet have an operating mine. The airship is still awaiting certification from Transport Canada.Lockheed has long been trying to secure a customer for the airships. Lockheed is working with Hybrid to target a commercial market for the slow-moving airships.The airships would be used by Quest to provide dedicated air services between the company's Strange Lake complex mine site in Northern Quebec and Schefferville, which has a rail link to the Port of Sept-Iles. Straightline, the only announced operator of the airships, expects to convert a letter of intent into a firm order for 12 of the aircraft in early 2017, chief operating officer Mark Dorey said on Wednesday.

1135,"  SIMI VALLEY, Calif. Frank Kendall, the Pentagon's chief arms buyer, said on Saturday he was hopeful that a proposed three-year block buy of Lockheed Martin Corp F-35 fighter jets, expected to generate large savings, would go ahead.""I can't say what's in the final budget, but I'm very hopeful that the block buy will proceed as planned, Kendall told Reuters at the annual Reagan National Defense Forum in southern California.Kendall said Pentagon officials had debated postponing or scrapping the block buy, which would cover more than 400 aircraft and includes purchases by the U.S. military and other countries participating in the F-35 program, until after operational testing and evaluation had been completed.The Pentagon's chief weapons tester, Michael Gilmore, has long argued about the need to test the planes before buying and building larger quantities.The Pentagon and its international buyers have pushed hard for the block buy to help drive costs lower via bigger economies of scale.Partners counting on the ""block buy"" include Norway which is banking on saving about $50 million (400 million Norwegian kroner) when it buys 12 F-35 warplanes from Lockheed in the proposed group purchase. News that the bundled purchases were likely to continue come after tense negotiations between Lockheed and the government about the latest F-35 contracts.In November, negotiations on buying the ninth batch of F-35 warplanes broke down and the government imposed a contract on the U.S. arms maker after more than a year of negotiations had failed to culminate in a suitable agreement. Ultimately, the DOD priced the 57 jets in ninth batch of F-35s at $6.1 billion. In a statement at the time, Lockheed said it was disappointed the contract had not been mutually agreed.Scrapping the block buy, which covers fiscal years 2018 through 2020, would have been another blow to the F-35 program, and allies counting on the deal to lower production costs. Lockheed and its key partners, Northrop Grumman Corp, Pratt & Whitney and BAE Systems, are developing and building three variants of the F-35s for the U.S. military and 10 allies including: Britain, Australia, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, Italy, Turkey, Israel, Japan and South Korea.
