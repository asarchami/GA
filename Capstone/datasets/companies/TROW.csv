6,"   By Linda Stern | NEW YORK, March 12  NEW YORK, March 12 In the retirement planning space, there are two realities.The first consists of spreadsheets, calculators and frightening rules of thumb to guide workers and retirees in their saving and spending decisions.The other reality exists in the space where Mom and Pop Retiree actually live. That is the true reality, the one you'll probably be living in yourself when you leave your last job.It is little examined, despite the heavy volume of regularly published reports on retirement expectations and projections.Yet we know a few things about the way real people actually retire. Typically, they haven't saved 25 times their annual spending, as is often recommended. Nor do they switch from stocks to bonds on the day they retire, which incidentally is probably before they reach the Social Security Administration's ""full retirement age"" of 66.They don't carefully calculate their monthly spending plans based on their Excel spreadsheets (unless they are engineers). They don't change their personalities when they retire. They typically enjoy retirement life and enjoy participating in the same kinds of activities that gave them pleasure before they retired.Workers should plan and prepare for retirement. But they're more likely to succeed if they plan for what actually lies ahead. Here are a few things we know to be true about retirement now. - Reality: You'll spend less than you think. But only after you spend more than you think.Much is made of the idea that you need to plan on spending 80 percent to 100 percent of the amount you spend in your final years of work. But that isn't even close to true. Most people spend a  lot in their first year or two of retirement when they take long deferred trips, fix up the house, invest in hobbies and the like.But over time, retiree spending drops substantially. Households headed by people over the age of 75 spend just 72 percent of what households headed by people between the ages of 65 and 74 do, and they spend just 63 percent of what households headed by people 55-64 do, according to an analysis of U.S. Department of Labor figures by J.P. Morgan Asset Management. The firm recently did a wide-ranging review of retirement practices. Household spending actually peaks in households led by 48 year olds; their spending is almost cut in half by the time they are over 75. - Reality: You won't work until you are 70. Now, workers are regularly told that they will benefit greatly if they work until they are 70, and hold off until that age before collecting Social Security benefits. That's true - but not very realistic.In fact, fewer than 2 percent of retirees make it to 70 before they start drawing on Social Security, JPMorgan found. The average retirement age is 61, according to a recent Gallup survey. Many people who intend to work until they are 70 find themselves pushed out of jobs or having to retire for health reasons far earlier than they expect. Given this reality, it's smart for early retirees to get professional help figuring out whether they are better off drawing down savings and deferring Social Security benefits or starting those benefits earlier and protecting their savings.- Reality: Your spending won't be stable and you may not want your income to be. Retirees spend much of their money in chunks. They buy a car one year, take a trip in another, reach into their savings to help grandchildren go to college. Sometimes they have lean years, where they stay home and concentrate on their gardens and reading. As their health falters, they spend large sums of money in short amounts of time paying for care.Retirees also don't inflate their spending on an annual basis to match the Consumer Price Index, investment firm T. Rowe Price has found. They tend to hold savings withdrawals somewhat stable from one year to the next. And they do allow their spending to be somewhat responsive to market returns, cinching those belts tighter after losing years and spending a little more freely after experiencing high returns. That means that a proper retirement nest egg allows for that variability - it keeps some money liquid and doesn't tie up too much in annuity products that pay out the same amount of money month in and month out.JP Morgan Asset Management's chief findings were in this area. It found that the so-called 4 percent rule of thumb for retirement withdrawals may not be the best way to calculate them. Retirees willing to adjust their withdrawals annually based on market returns, and willing to forego annual inflation adjustments can actually start their retirements withdrawing 5 percent or more of assets in their first year of retirement, depending on their age.- You probably won't run out of money. Most retirees don't spend blithely at a pre-conceived rate until their larders are empty and the money's all gone. They constrain their spending more gradually to match their resources. Those people who do literally run out of money tend to be older, sicker people who depend upon Medicaid funding to pay for costly nursing home care.- Reality: You'll have fun. It doesn't take huge amounts of money to build a successful retirement, and in fact, happiness doesn't always build along with individual retirement account balances. In the JP Morgan Asset management research, the amount of increased satisfaction that a retiree gets seems to flatten once their spending tops $40,000 a year.  Some 68 percent of retirees in a 2011 Consumer Reports survey said they were ""highly satisfied"" with their retirement lives. Reality: The best things in life are free.",2014-03-12,TROW,"Wed Mar 12, 2014 | 3:01pm EDT",Stern Advice - Getting real about retirement,http://www.reuters.com//article/column-stern-advice-idUSL2N0M71M020140312?type=companyNews

31,"   By Herbert Lash | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Asset management firm T. Rowe Price Group conducted a trade last year as an experiment that a top trader at the firm said underscored the shortcomings of a U.S. stock market dominated by high-frequency trading.Andrew Brooks, the firm's head of U.S. equity trading, said T. Rowe (TROW.O) used a reputable broker-dealer algorithm to buy shares of a heavily traded stock. He was surprised that in order to purchase 2.5 million shares, the firm had to indicate an interest in buying 750 million shares, or 300 times that amount.""It's dysfunctional,"" Brooks told the audience at a Baruch College conference on financial markets in New York in October 2013.But this year, the fund manager is taking a fresh approach to understand high-frequency trading. A group of T. Rowe's traders paid a visit in September to Virtu Financial, a firm known for its technological prowess.The visit was described by two sources, one from T. Rowe and one from Virtu. Other firms have also made the pilgrimage to the company as investors try to get a handle on what makes the market-making firm tick, a source at Virtu said.These trips, along with other industry developments, suggest some money managers know they are ignorant about much of what happens to orders once they are sent to be executed.Last spring, Virtu was vilified after divulging in March that it had posted only one losing day in five years of trading. Critics pointed to that revelation as a sign high-frequency traders were getting away with murder.Then came the best-selling book ""Flash Boys,"" in which author Michael Lewis said the market is rigged in favor of high-frequency traders. Virtu was forced to delay plans to go public. Asset holders have been pressuring their money managers to learn more about how their orders are routed. They want to understand whether cost, liquidity or trading strategy were the best available, and whether the routing process budged a security's price. Finding that information has not been easy.Investors know the price, size and where a trade was executed. But it is hard to find information about where an order was routed before it was filled, or why some shares were executed on one venue and not another.""When you get at the most granular level, the routing strategy and how they approach the market, it's just impossible to find information,"" said Larry Tabb, founder and chief executive of TABB Group, a capital markets advisory firm.Clive Williams, global head of trading at T. Rowe, and six other traders traveled to New York in September to watch Virtu trade 50,000 shares of an unnamed stock, the sources told Reuters. Williams wanted to learn about how Virtu routes trades across asset classes and markets, a key concern for T. Rowe, a global firm with $731.2 billion in assets under management as of Sept. 30.Brooks, who has been critical of the market's structure, has urged an exhaustive audit of order routing. The source at T. Rowe said few investors have tried to get to the bottom of why Virtu or other high-frequency firms are so profitable.""Why aren't you asking the question, 'What are they doing that we are not?'"" said the T. Rowe source, adding that Virtu traded the 50,000 shares ""very efficiently.""The T. Rowe source acknowledged Virtu has great technology. Still, it remained hard to compare the small trade that T. Rowe traders witnessed with the larger, experimental one that was conducted using another firm's algorithm. Details of that earlier trade are lacking: for example, how the algorithm was programmed to buy 2.5 million shares, and the market's condition at the time. At the heart of Virtu's operations is an order management system that measures many key risks: Whether a trade is the right amount at the right price, if too many shares have been sent to a venue where they may not all get executed, and how price will be affected.The system and the technology behind it are key for Virtu, which trades in more than 210 markets around the world, in stocks, foreign exchange and commodities. Order management systems are not novel, and knowing which is best is subjective.Brian Lees, the trading applications manager at Capital Group Cos., the parent company of American Funds, is leading an initiative of about 20 asset management firms to better understand what happens to orders by gleaning routing and other information on order tickets. The effort is organized through the FIX Trading Community, which sets global trading standards.After more than four years of effort, information is still lacking because of different vendor systems and broker reluctance to provide the data. ""There's an expectation that we understand what's being done on our behalf when we go into the market. It's not our algorithms that we wrote but it's our order that's out there, and we're expected to understand how it's behaving. If we don't have this information how are we going to know that?"" Lees said.

36,"   By Tom Hals | WILMINGTON, Del  WILMINGTON, Del An increasingly popular tactic used by hedge funds and others to extract more money from buyouts could soon face a major courtroom test when a big investor in Dell Inc may argue that it should be paid a higher price for the 2013 acquisition of the PC maker.    The strategy, known as ""appraisal,"" usually involves an investor who opposes a buyout price asking a judge to determine the fair value for the stock. The tactic is also known as ""dissenter's rights"" and is meant to protect investors from underpriced buyouts, but some Wall Street dealmakers say hedge funds use it as a hold-up strategy to squeeze extra money from mergers.    The question in the Delaware litigation is whether an investor can come back to seek an appraisal once it emerges that the investor voted for, not against, the deal. The investor, T Rowe Price, is seeking a higher price for its Dell stock than the $13.75 per share offered in the $26 billion buyout led by Michael Dell and Silver Lake Partners. Some holdout Dell investors have said fair value of Dell's stock was up to $25 per share. That could mean hundreds of millions of dollars are on the line for T Rowe Price and Michael Dell.DISCOVERY     T Rowe Price's case began in February 2014 when the company asked Delaware judge Travis Laster to appraise its roughly 27 million Dell shares, according to court records. It said it had notified Dell and had not voted its stock for the deal, satisfying the legal requirements for appraisal.    However, in an apparent about-face, the money manager reported to securities regulators in August that it voted for the deal across its funds. That vote came to light earlier this month, based on a review of filings by USA Today.    Asked if it had voted for the Dell deal, T Rowe Price did not directly respond.    ""We are aware of a discrepancy in the communication of our voting instruction on the Dell buyout,"" the company said in a statement.  At a court hearing on Monday, Gregory Williams, a lawyer for Dell, briefly addressed T Rowe Price's appraisal and told Laster the computer maker would soon begin ""aggressive, limited discovery"" into the fund manager's vote. Williams said Dell might ask Laster to toss T Rowe Price's appraisal claim.    One Delaware law specialist said that if regulatory filings are correct, T Rowe Price's gamble on appraisal may be over.    ""I think there is a pretty serious question of their continued ability to pursue appraisal rights,"" said Larry Hamermesh, a professor at the Widener University School of Law in Wilmington, Delaware.      T Rowe Price is one of scores of Dell holders to seek appraisal claims, covering more than 38 million shares in total, according to court records.     Laster heard arguments on Monday that many of those claims should be tossed for technical reasons. He did not say when he would rule. WALL STREET CRITICISM T Rowe Price's appraisal claims were not among those challenged by Dell on Monday and the fund manager's attorney, Stuart Grant, did not discuss his client's appraisal claim at the hearing.    One corporate law professor said T Rowe Price will be able to continue seeking appraisal even if it voted for the deal.    This is because the law governing appraisal looks not to the vote of the beneficial holder of the stock, which is T Rowe Price, but to the record-holder of the stock. For the vast majority of investors, including T Rowe Price, the record holder was Cede & Co, which aggregates stock certificates.     Delaware judges have found that so long as an investor's appraisal claim is covered by an outstanding number of Cede-held shares that abstained or voted no on the deal, the appraisal case can proceed.    Brian Quinn, a professor at Boston College Law School, acknowledged T Rowe Price's situation looks bad from a public relations standpoint. ""But when you look at the law, I don't think it will matter,"" he said.    That law has fueled Wall Street criticism of appraisal, which has been used by a growing number of hedge funds to wring a bit more money from a merger.    The funds often seek appraisal using stock they bought after the record date for determining who casts a ballot on the deal. As companies see it, the hedge funds are pursuing dissenter's rights without voting on the deal.     Quinn said that T Rowe Price is distinct from the hedge funds, even if it is using the law in the same way.    Hedge funds buy their stock at the last minute and often seek a quick settlement.    T Rowe Price was a long-term holder of Dell stock and a vocal critic of the price of the Dell deal. Its large appraisal claim is the kind of action that Delaware judges have said can act as a necessary deterrent against underpriced deals.

43,"   By David Randall and Chuck Mikolajczak | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Oct 13 The era of making a broad bet on mutual fund companies as a way to play America's self-funded retirement boom appears to have ended.After outpacing the market during both the 1990s and early 2000s bull runs, the stocks of standalone mutual fund companies such as T. Rowe Price Group Inc, Eaton Vance Corp  and Franklin Resources Inc have fallen behind, gaining just half the amount of the broad S&P 500 over the last five years.Analysts say there is little reason to expect a broad snapback in shares anytime soon, largely because the firms, big in the retirement space that mushroomed once 401ks and IRAs began to replace traditional pensions in the early 1980s, are now facing the flip side of those savings plans: withdrawals.Last year marked the first time that more money came out of 401(k) plans than was added, with $377 billion in withdrawals outpacing $338 billion in deposits, according to Cerulli Associates. Those declines are expected to accelerate as the baby boom generation ages.At the same time, standalone fund firms are losing assets to lower-cost and less-profitable passively managed mutual funds and exchange traded funds. Private firm Vanguard, best known for its index funds, is the world's second-largest asset manager, behind only BlackRock Inc, whose iShares line makes it the world's largest ETF provider, according to IPE Research.Even fund companies that establish their own ETFs may find themselves retaining assets by cannibalizing their own more fee-intensive funds. Adding insult to injury, fund company margins have been hurt in recent years by near-zero short-term interest rates that have prompted companies to waive fees on some funds.After selling off since peaking late in 2014, many fund companies have become cheap when compared with their historical standard and the broader S&P 500 index. T. Rowe Price's price-to-earnings ratio hit a 20-year low of 14.3 on Oct. 7 and has edged up slightly to 14.5. Franklin Resources'  forward PE stood at 12.1, up slightly from a 3-year low. As of Oct. 12, BlackRock Inc's forward PE was at a 1-year low of 15.1, even with the S&P's. In the past, these companies have had PEs in the high 20s. Thomson Reuters Starmine holds an intrinsic value of  $49.80 for Franklin Resources stock, $407.90 for BlackRock and $90.15 for T. Rowe Price, all well above their recent trading levels.TAILORED BETS Mutual fund companies still have a lot of money in their coffers. Actively managed funds oversee a total of approximately $8.1 trillion in assets, compared with $1.6 trillion invested in ETFs, according to Lipper data. But analysts and fund managers say they have to be much more selective to make money by buying shares of fund companies. Even with their depressed share prices, not every one is a bargain.Investors say it requires specific attributes - a fund lineup with a history of beating peers or a sizable money market business - to help a company expand while the broad industry slows.""Not everyone is going to be comfortable going with a completely passive approach, especially if the market continues to be volatile,"" said Stephen Biggar, an analyst at Argus Research.Judson Brooks, an analyst who works on the $17.5 billion Oakmark Fund, said his fund owns shares of T. Rowe Price - down 14 percent year to date - largely because its track record of beating its peers should continue to attract assets. The company announced in July that 76 percent of its funds outperformed their Lipper averages over the last three years, and 86 outperformed their peers over the last 10 years.""The essential element of the company is that they have been able to maintain their outperformance, and we think they have a culture where that is going to continue,"" Brooks said.Higher interest rates, meanwhile, should help the companies expand their margins. A 0.25 percent increase in interest rates would allow mutual fund companies to recoup 65 percent of fee waivers, while a 1.0 percent increase in rates would allow firms to eliminate fee waivers entirely, analysts say.T. Rowe Price waived $12.5 million in fees last quarter to maintain positive yields for investors in money market accounts, an amount roughly equal to what it spent on advertising and marketing. Once interest rates rise high enough, ending fee waivers should boost its revenues by about 1.3 percent, analysts say.Higher rates would especially help Federated Investors, which has approximately 69 percent of its $354 billion in assets under management in money market funds, said Argus' Biggar. Shares of the company are down 9.8 percent for the year to date and trade at a forward price to earnings ratio of 16.1, according to Thomson Reuters data.(Reporting by David Randall with additional reporting by Chuck Mikolajczak; Editing by Linda Stern and Dan Grebler)",2015-10-13,TROW,"Tue Oct 13, 2015 | 11:48am EDT",End of an era: Mutual fund companies no longer a market bright spot,http://www.reuters.com//article/fund-stocks-idUSL1N12C0MX20151013?type=companyNews
44,"  (Adds details from Bernstein poll in third paragraph)By Tim McLaughlinNov 19 Several large U.S. funds that boosted their stakes in Allergan Plc in recent months appear to be optimistic about the company's growth prospects, even before Pfizer's reported $150 billion takeover bid for the botox maker.Pfizer Inc is negotiating to buy Allergan, which also makes dry eye treatments, for $370 to $380 per share, a person familiar with the discussions said, compared to its current traded value of around $301.There is some dissatisfaction, however, with that price range, according to a poll by Sanford C. Bernstein research. Its poll of 87 investors showed that 54 percent wanted $390 to $400 a share, but 36 percent were satisfied with the lower reported price range.Wells Fargo senior portfolio manager Margaret Patel, whose  Diversified Capital Builder Fund owned $2.7 million worth of Allergan at the end of September, said on Thursday Pfizer's reported bid is plenty good.""I think it's a big premium over the current valuation, and at some point you have to say, 'Is there any more new good news to be uncovered?"" Apparently so.Third-quarter fund disclosures reveal that existing Allergan shareholders added a net 10.4 million shares to their holdings. There were newcomers, too.Geode Capital, the hedge fund unit of Boston-based Fidelity Investments, bought 3.1 million Allergan shares, fund disclosures show. Takeovers have been a staple for the pharmaceutical industry, but investors are not necessarily making acquisition premiums a part of their investment thesis. In a note last month to investors, hedge fund Lone Pine Capital said it expects Allergan's profits to grow at double-digit rates even without acquisitions that have historically been part of their value-creation formulas. At the end of September, Lone Pine reported owning 2.6 million shares worth $709 million.Polen Capital sold its remaining stake in Allergan at the end of last year, but only after generating a nearly six-fold return for clients, according to analyst Stephen Atkins.Funds run by Vanguard Group and T. Rowe Price Group Inc  are among Allergan's largest investors, owning about 6 percent each of the company's outstanding stock, according to Thomson Reuters data. A takeover deal would redomicile U.S. drug giant Pfizer in Ireland just as the U.S. Treasury is preparing to clamp down on so-called inversions that limit a company's tax liability. Inversions typically involve a U.S. multinational buying a smaller foreign competitor and relocating to its home country, if only on paper, to escape U.S. taxation.Inversions figure to be a hot topic in 2016 in a national election year that will determine the next U.S. president.""We shall see whether the administration and Congress are able to block deals that are largely done based on tax inversions,"" said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors' U.S. Intermediary Business in Boston.Mario Gabelli, whose Gamco Investors owned $23 million worth of Pfizer stock at the end of September, said he would commend Pfizer for making a move to get Allergan and lower its tax rate.""The U.S. corporate tax structure is uncompetitive,"" Gabelli said.

Portfolio managers can vote counter to the policy, where warranted, the asset manager said.Still, the change at one the largest publicly traded fund firms, with $763 billion in assets under management at the end of last year, sends a message to boardrooms and could boost efforts by activists to equalize voting rights at some established companies.At Viacom, investors are calling for controlling shareholder Sumner Redstone to end a dual-class structure, saying it insulates leaders from investor pressure.Meanwhile, Rupert Murdoch maintains his influence at Twenty-First Century Fox Inc and News Corp thanks to a similar structure, as do the founders of Google parent Alphabet Inc. In all, more than 10 percent of companies in the Russell 3000 Index have unequal voting of shares, according to FactSet. Donna Anderson, head of T. Rowe Price's corporate governance efforts, said the Baltimore-based company adopted the new policy last month after becoming alarmed by the rising number of initial public offerings with dual-class structures, mimicking the larger companies.Proponents of new rules say outside investors should have an equal vote in corporate decisions, while backers of dual-class structures say they help ensure that founders and other trusted leaders can plan for the long term - and that outside investors understand the rules when buying shares.There were no immediate signs that other big fund firms would make a similar change. A spokeswoman for Vanguard Group said it had no plans to change its voting policies to follow T. Rowe Price’s lead. A spokesman for BlackRock Inc declined to comment on the matter and Fidelity Investments did not immediately return a request for comment. T. Rowe Price and other fund firms have backed efforts for change before, but the new policy specifically focuses on directors the company has backed in the past. ""To just endorse their re-election every year sends the wrong message,"" Anderson said in an interview this week. Under the new policy, at dual-class U.S. companies with unequal voting rights, T. Rowe Price funds now will vote against lead independent directors, or independent chairs, and all nominating and corporate governance committee members.  While the new policy may not determine whether directors are re-elected, T.

48,"   By Trevor Hunnicutt | NEW YORK, March 10  NEW YORK, March 10 With its pitch to sell a new kind of exchange-traded fund held up by regulators, T. Rowe Price Group Inc may turn to traditional ETFs to get started in that market, a spokesman told Reuters.The Baltimore fund company, which manages $766 billion in mutual funds and other investment products, is one of the top asset managers not to offer a lineup of ETFs, in part because traditional ETF structures require that stockpickers disclose their holdings daily.Fund managers, who want to protect the privacy of their investment-choosing strategy, view the disclosures as a threat.T. Rowe Price applied to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in 2013 to introduce so-called ""non-transparent"" ETFs, which allow for the kind of active management its traditional funds are known for, but with less frequent portfolio disclosures. But it now finds that application on the slow track in Washington. Instead, the company now may explore offering ETFs that use quantitative methods to pick stocks and other securities, or to offer bond ETFs, said T. Rowe Price representative Brian Lewbart, who spoke to Reuters last week. He declined to comment further.""We are not prepared to discuss potential specific products at this time, and don't have a set time frame,"" said Lewbart. Just one fund company has found a way for so-called active managers to bypass the daily-disclosure requirements. The company, Eaton Vance Corp, launched its first such ""NextShares"" fund on Feb 26 and is licensing the right to launch such funds to its industry competitors.But T. Rowe Price and other asset managers, including BlackRock Inc, have applications pending before the SEC for their own ""non-transparent"" ETFs. The timeline for considering such applications has been pushed out, Lewbart said, following a bout of volatility on Aug. 24 that caused a number of popular ETFs to trade at prices far below the quoted value of their holdings.The dysfunctional trading that day raised new questions for regulators about the ability of the funds and equity markets more broadly to manage a spell of heavy selling pressure.A spokesman for the SEC declined to comment.

54,"   By Tom Hals | WILMINGTON, Del.  WILMINGTON, Del. T. Rowe Price Group Inc  cannot sue computer maker Dell Inc for a higher price in the 2013 buyout by its founder because  the fund company voted, albeit mistakenly, in favor of the deal, a Delaware judge has ruled.The unusual dispute leading to Wednesday's decision stemmed from the mutual fund company's bid to recoup more for its 27 million Dell shares than the $13.75 per share paid in the buyout, by using a type of lawsuit known as appraisal.After Michael Dell and private equity firm Silver Lake took the computer maker private, hundreds of shareholders unhappy with the terms, egged on by billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn, sought to have a judge review whether the price was fair.The initial amount of Dell stock being appraised made it one of the biggest cases of its kind.To qualify for an appraisal, a shareholder must not vote for a deal and must continuously hold the stock until the deal closes. T. Rowe Price actively opposed the buyout and thought it voted against it.But according to Wednesday's decision, its voting system generated instructions to vote in favor of the merger. The instructions were passed through stockholder service firms including Institutional Shareholder Services Inc, Broadridge Financial Solutions and Cede & Co.The error proved fatal. ""The T. Rowe Petitioners' shares do not qualify for appraisal,"" Judge Travis Laster of Delaware's Court of Chancery wrote in a 70-page opinion. Bill Benintende, a T. Rowe Price spokesman, said: ""We're disappointed in the ruling and are in the process of reviewing the opinion and evaluating our options.""Hedge funds that specialize in arbitration cases have been criticized for buying stock of companies involved in mergers so late in the process that they are not entitled to vote. Delaware courts have found that as long as they did not vote for deals, they can seek appraisals.But mutual funds, unlike hedge funds, must report how they voted, which is how T. Rowe Price's Dell vote came to light.Last year, Laster ruled that T.

The 10-million share offering was priced at $15 each, above the expected range of $12-$14.Twilio's IPO, the first offering from a technology ""unicorn"" this year and only the third by a tech company this year, was seen as a test of investor appetite for IPOs.Up to Tuesday, the U.S. technology IPO market had raised just $322 million this year, down from $3.35 billion in the same period last year, hurt by the poor performance of many recent IPOs.

60,"  (Repeats to widen distribution)By Tim McLaughlin and Heather SomervilleBOSTON/SAN FRANCISCO Aug 11 Some U.S. mutual funds are boosting their performance with relatively big bets on private companies such as Uber and Pinterest, which they have been marking up at a rate far greater than the broad stock market.Relied upon by millions of Americans to save for their retirement, mutual funds emphasize that their investments in young tech companies ahead of their initial public offerings are relatively small.A Reuters analysis of fund filings and other data shows, though, that some have taken a more aggressive approach, boosting the share of these companies to more than 5 percent of assets and awarding them rich valuations that in some cases have helped them beat their benchmarks and peers by a wider margin.Mutual funds' involvement also helped boost the number of so-called unicorns - private companies valued at $1 billion or more.These private investments come at a risk, though. Many are young companies that have yet to make a profit. They are also  harder to price and to sell than publicly traded stocks.That could hurt investors in a downturn because fund managers forced to meet investor redemptions may have to sell liquid public companies while marking down the unlisted ones, said Larry Swedroe, director of research at Buckingham Asset Management in St. Louis.""Private companies typically trade at significant discounts for that reason,"" Swedroe said.In a rising market, though, they help shore up performance.  Bets on Uber Technologies and other unlisted companies, for example, helped the Hartford Growth Opportunities Fund deliver a 12.7 percent return in 12 months to Oct. 31 compared with a peer fund average of 5.2 percent, according to Lipper Inc.The $4.5 billion fund cited Uber among top contributors to performance in its report for fiscal 2015, alongside Amazon.com Inc and Netflix Inc. The ride-services company's valuation in the fund surged 156 percent to $82.5 million, Hartford disclosures show. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2b05PIu)Its pre-IPO stakes accounted for nearly 6 percent of net assets while most of its peers have kept their exposure below 1 percent, fund holdings show. Hartford declined to comment. Pre-IPO investments can amplify a fund's relative performance because they are not included in a comparison benchmark index and some have far outpaced the stock market.Fidelity Investments' valuation of Contrafund's Series E stake in content sharing company Pinterest has tripled to $480 million since an initial investment in October 2013, compared to the S&P 500's 25 percent rise.In a statement, Fidelity said such investments were ""very small positions in the relatively few Fidelity funds that make such investments."" (Graphic:  tmsnrt.rs/2beUO6y)Over the long term, the impact of those stakes on performance may be less significant in a fund as large as the $109 billion Contrafund, than in some smaller peers.OUTSIZED EFFECT  Mutual fund investments, however, have measurable effect on companies' valuations. Those that received such financing last year saw their valuations more than double over their previous funding round. In contrast, valuations of companies that raised cash without mutual fund investors grew 1.5 times, according to PitchBook, a private equity, M&A and venture capital database.The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been asking mutual fund companies how they value their stakes in companies like Uber, Pinterest Inc and Airbnb.The regulator is worried investors could get hurt in case of a sharp tech downturn, according to two people familiar with the SEC's queries. They were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter.Pre-IPO investments can have an outsized negative impact when marked down, which happened to startups such as cloud storage firm Dropbox or software startup Zenefits.Facing a tough challenge from index-tracking funds, actively-managed mutual funds led by Fidelity Investments, BlackRock, T.

Their investments helped boost inflows that year to $51 billion, a 14-year high, according to Thomson Reuters data. Since then mutual funds have dialed down their pre-IPO deals after several Silicon Valley companies missed growth targets, even though they took part in a $1.3 billion funding of messaging app Snapchat earlier this year and are buying shares from employees and founders to raise their stakes in companies.Some funds count Uber, Pinterest and WeWork Companies Inc, among their largest holdings, filings show. For example, Uber is a top 15 holding in the $19 billion Fidelity Blue Chip Growth fund.At T. Rowe Price, private investments made up about 4 percent of assets of its $16 billion New Horizons Fund   at the end of 2015.

74,"  NEW YORK Shares of cloud storage company NetSuite Inc dipped 1 percent to $92.80 on Friday, after surging the day before, maintaining a wide discount from Oracle Inc's takeover offer price that expires on Friday.Oracle, the software giant run by founder Larry Ellison, agreed to buy NetSuite in July for $109 per share, or $9.3 billion, to better compete with nimbler rivals such as Workday Inc and Salesforce.com Inc that specialize in cloud-based offerings.In September, NetSuite disclosed that it received a formal letter from T. Rowe Price, the company's second-largest shareholder behind Ellison, opposing the deal price. The letter criticized the process behind the deal and said T. Rowe would not tender its shares.Oracle was forced to extend its tender offer deadline to Friday. T. Rowe sent a letter last week to Oracle suggesting the company raise its offer to $133 per share. Oracle has said it will not raise its bid.  NetSuite shares soared by more than 6 percent on Thursday, prompting the stock to be temporarily halted. The stock has steadily declined since resuming trading on Thursday afternoon.According to terms of the Oracle agreement, a majority of NetSuite's 40.8 million unaffiliated shares, or shares not tied to Ellison and other insiders, must be tendered for the deal to be completed.  As of July, T. Rowe owned 12.2 million NetSuite shares, meaning if one of the other large fund managers in the stock, Capital World or Brown Advisory, also refuse to tender their shares, the agreement will struggle to get the majority it needs. Capital World is NetSuite's third-largest shareholder and Brown Advisory is the fourth largest, according to Thomson Reuters data.  Spokeswomen for NetSuite and Oracle could not immediately be reached on Friday to comment about the results of the tender offer.

75,"  (Repeats for wider distribution)By Michael FlahertyNEW YORK Nov 4Tensions between Ultratech, Inc  and one of its largest shareholders got so high that by the spring, the chief executive was calling the investor a ""cockroach"" and refusing to meet with him.The target of the CEO's ire was not a brash activist investor seeking a quick shake-up but Benjamin Nahum, a portfolio manager at Neuberger Berman, the mutual fund company that had held stock of the tech industry supplier for over a decade.Neuberger Berman, along with Franklin Resources, Artisan Partners and several other large mutual fund firms are part of a growing band of traditional U.S. money managers that are taking a page out of the activist investor playbook by publicly agitating for change at companies they believe can perform better.In the past, so-called active fund managers that aim to pick the best stock and bond performers rather than passively follow an index, would have voiced concerns to CEOs in private, if they chose to speak up at all. Public agitation has normally been the realm of activist hedge funds and a cadre of smaller funds.By voicing frustrations for all to see, large active fund managers open the door even further for other major shareholders to join the public fight and add pressure on CEOs and boards to address the proposed strategy shifts, leadership shuffles and other changes.T. Rowe Price, historically the most outspoken of the big active managers, is currently pushing Oracle Corp to improve its $9.3 billion offer for cloud storage company NetSuite Inc, which expires on Friday. The fund, which manages $763 billion, has sent a detailed letter to each company and has said it will not tender its shares.The mutual funds' public efforts to wring more value out of their holdings is in part a response to the rising competition from the low-fee index-tracking funds.""You just can't follow the herd anymore. The idea of active means defending and enhancing your investment,"" said Nahum, the Neuberger portfolio manager. The more aggressive approach seems to be working for T. Rowe Price, Franklin Resources and Neuberger Berman. Active equity funds of the first two have outperformed their active and passive peers this year, while Neuberger was just behind its rivals, according to data from Thomson Reuters Lipper (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2ej2ogj).Shares of Ultratech have risen 35 percent since August 2015 when Nahum sent a private letter to CEO Arthur Zafiropoulo and his management team, which kicked off the fight over the company's stock performance and its executive compensation plan, filings show.In April of this year, Neuberger, which oversees $255 billion in assets, informed the company it was nominating two board candidates. The fight was on.A Zafiropoulo representative later met with Nahum to tell him that the CEO thought the portfolio manager was a ""cockroach"" who was disrupting the company and should back off, according to people familiar with the matter. Shareholders voted Neuberger's nominees onto the board at the July annual meeting.Ultratech declined to comment on Neuberger Berman's campaign and was unable to make Zafiropoulo available to comment on what transpired publicly or privately between him and the fund. OUTFLOW Investors have been moving away from active fund managers to index tracking funds that charge about eight times less than the active funds and yet have outperformed them by 149 basis points over the past five years, according to Thomson Reuters Lipper.Speaking up in public risks alienating CEOs and their teams, but private dialogue, which mutual fund managers have preferred in the past, is easier to ignore than public protests.Forced to compete both against their peers and passive investors, active funds are more willing to put their access to management on the line, according to Bruce Goldfarb, the founder of proxy advisory firm Okapi Partners. ""We're seeing more cases where active managers are putting their mouth where their money is,"" Goldfarb said.Franklin Resources, with assets of $771 billion, is a case in point.In its September profile of activist investors, investment bank Lazard described Franklin as increasingly willing to take its discussions public. The fund pushed chemicals firm Axiall Corp to review its strategic options, which ultimately led to the company's $2.3 billion sale in June of this year to fellow chemical company Westlake Chemical Corp.It also struck a deal with drug maker BioPharmX Inc in August, which resulted in an independent director being added to the board.
