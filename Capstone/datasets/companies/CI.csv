1,"   By Caroline Humer | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Cigna Corp has enrolled between 75,000 and 100,000 people in Obamacare health plans for 2014, Chief Executive David Cordani said on Tuesday at the Reuters Health Summit.Among those, about two-thirds signed up through the public exchanges created as part of President Barack Obama's healthcare reform law, popularly called Obamacare, Cordani said on the day after the enrollment period for the plans ended. The rest signed up directly with Cigna.Cigna, whose health insurance business focuses on large corporations, began offering the new individual plans in Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Tennessee and Texas this year. The federal enrollment website HealthCare.gov sells plans for 36 states, while 14 others, including Colorado, run their own exchanges.Enrollment began slowly because of technology problems on most exchanges, but a spike in demand before the March 31 sign-up deadline boosted enrollment to higher than expected levels. Obama said on Tuesday that 7.1 million people had signed up for coverage under the Affordable Care Act and declared the law was achieving its goals despite a messy rollout. HealthCare.gov experienced sporadic outages on Monday under the load of traffic.Technology issues and slow enrollment also contributed to a mix of customers that skewed toward people older than expected during the early months. Cordani said that compared with that group, more younger people began signing up for the plans in recent weeks. More people are paying their first month's premiums now than they were earlier this year, Cordani said. About 75 to 80 percent of people had paid their premiums in January and gotten coverage. That percentage has now risen to the low 80s, he said.Cigna is looking at its new customers and trying to ascertain as much information as possible to decide about its participation in 2015 and if it will expand to more markets, Cordani said.

5,"   By Caroline Humer  U.S. health insurer Cigna Corp (CI.N) on Thursday said that early enrollees in new plans created under President Barack Obama's healthcare law used medical services more than it expected, confirming early forecasts it would lose money on the business in 2014.The loss tied to Obamacare, which accounts for 3 percent of Cigna's revenue, did not prevent Cigna's first-quarter earnings from beating Wall Street expectations.Company shares gained 3.5 percent as its much larger employer-based and government Medicare businesses improved, due to stronger cost controls and relatively light use of medical services by customers, partly due to a moderate flu season.The report by Cigna follows earnings beats by larger competitors WellPoint Inc WLP.N and Aetna Inc (AET.N) for the first quarter as well. They also said visits to doctors and hospitals were light.Cigna Chief Executive Officer David Cordani said the company now expects to sign up about 116,000 people for 2014 health plans that have the new benefits required under Obama's Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, about 20 percent more than it had expected.The mix of new members who signed up close to an April deadline for coverage matched Cigna's expectations in terms of age and type of plans selected, Cordani said. But people who had signed up earlier in the enrollment process, which began in October, are accounting for higher medical costs than the company had planned for.Nationwide, more than 8 million have signed up for Obamacare plans, according to federal data. The Obama administration is expected to give a final tally soon. ""The early look at results from the Wave 1 enrollees ... is less attractive versus our expectation and less attractive than any of our business norms as relates to medical cost and medical service consumption,"" Cordani said in an interview, referring to people who signed up in the first few months of enrollment.Cordani said Cigna may expand into several new Obamacare markets in 2015 on the expectation that there is long-term opportunity in the business. Health insurers are due to submit their proposed plans, including pricing, to regulators by the end of next month.OBAMACARE'S BUSINESS MODEL Cigna's commentary on Obamacare adds to a developing picture on whether the exchanges will be sustainable in the long run. Their insight on the shift in enrollee age - and possibly health - matches those from larger competitors Aetna and WellPoint. But it was the first to provide details on medical use by early customers. Aetna has only said it expects the Obamacare business to be a ""headwind"" this year while WellPoint said on Wednesday it will earn a profit of 3 to 5 percent.The differences could reflect each company's own experiences in the individual market, which has long been dominated by Blue Cross Blue Shield plans, one analyst said. That can help with setting the right level of plan premiums to cover costs.""The individual market relies heavily upon how much of your presence is in the market currently. So WellPoint tends to have a lot of deep membership in certain markets. Cigna may not have that advantage,"" Morningstar Research analyst Vishnu Lekraj said. Cigna's overall quarterly financial performance improved from the previous quarter, when it missed analysts' earnings estimates, saying costs in its Medicare business were higher than expected.Cigna reported first-quarter net income of $528 million, or $1.92 per share, up from $57 million, or 20 cents per share, a year earlier, when it took a charge for exiting a business.The company reported earnings of $1.83 per share, excluding investment gains. On that basis, analysts on average were expecting $1.54, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Revenue grew in the quarter as the company added members and collected more premiums. It also beat expectations, reaching $8.5 billion, compared with analysts' estimates of $7.7 billion.Cigna ended the quarter with 14.17 million medical customers, up from 14.08 million at the end of 2013.The company raised its 2014 earnings outlook to a range of $7.05 to $7.35 per share. In February, it said it had expected $6.80 to $7.20.(Reporting by Caroline Humer; Editing by Michele Gershberg, Lisa Von Ahn and Chris Reese)",2014-05-01,CI,"Thu May 1, 2014 | 11:57am EDT",Cigna says early Obamacare enrollee costs are high,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-cigna-results-ceo-idUSBREA400GJ20140501?type=companyNews

7,"  May 1 Cigna Corp Chief Executive Officer David Cordani on Thursday said the health insurer expected to lose money on its new individual insurance business this year, based on what it has seen in the first quarter.Cordani said that people who signed up during the early months of enrollment for the new Obamacare plans were older than it expected, bought richer coverage and used medical services more. Later enrollees were younger and in line with the company's outlook, he said, but they have not yet begun to use their services so medical utilization rates remain unknown.  When asked if the company would lose money on the business, Cordani replied: ""Correct.""

8,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, July 09 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has upgraded Cigna Corp's (Cigna)  long-term IDR to 'A-' from 'BBB+' and unsecured senior debt ratings to 'BBB+'  from 'BBB'. In addition, Fitch has upgraded the Insurer Financial Strength (IFS)  ratings of various Cigna subsidiaries to 'A+' from 'A'.  The Rating Outlook is  Stable. A complete list of rating actions is listed below. KEY RATING DRIVERS: The rating upgrade reflects Cigna's strong operating results relative to current  rating category guidelines that Fitch believes are sufficient to overcome  expectations for margin pressure industry-wide. The upgrade also reflects  Cigna's improved credit profile after addressing variable annuity and  under-funded pension obligation issues. Balanced against these strengths is potential for a generally challenged  earnings environment following changes in the healthcare industry from  implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Consistently solid profitability and interest coverage are key rating components  partially offsetting high financial leverage.  During first quarter-2014  (1Q'14), annualized EBITDA/revenue was 12.6% and annualized return on capital  was 13.8%.  Both ratios are better than Fitch's guidelines for the 'A' rating  category.  EBITDA covered interest expense by 15.3 times during 1Q'14.  This  level of interest coverage is above Cigna's recent average which was in the low  double digits.  Interest coverage exceeded Fitch's median guideline for Cigna's  current rating category. Fitch's view is that the employer group market for health insurance is likely to  see membership dislocation to the individual market, largely though the public  exchanges with the implementation of the ACA.  In the intermediate term, Fitch  believes that Cigna is likely to be impacted by this trend, but to a lesser  degree than peers. Cigna's debt-to-rolling four-quarter EBITDA was 1.4x at March 31, 2014,  improving due to stronger earnings and exceeding Fitch's median guideline for  the current rating category.  Cigna's debt-to-total capital ratio was 34% at  March 31, 2014 and remains elevated relative to Fitch's guideline of 28% for the  current rating category.  Fitch expects the debt-to-total capital ratio to  gradually be reduced through capital retention over the next 2 years to the low  30% range.   Cigna addressed a potential source of earnings and capital volatility by  reinsuring most of its variable-annuity reinsurance business with Berkshire  Hathaway in 1Q'13.  A combination of rising interest rates and favorable equity  markets during 2013 increased the funded status of Cigna's pension plan.  Fitch  believes this improvement reduces the potential for future mandatory funding  requirements. Cigna offers healthcare products in all 50 states and internationally, reporting  14 million medical members and revenue of $32 billion in 2013.  Consequently,  Cigna's market position and size/scale are considered ""Large"" under Fitch's  sector credit factors.  Cigna's market position based on membership ranked  fourth behind UnitedHealth Group, Inc., WellPoint, Inc., and Aetna Inc. RATING SENSITIVITIES: The key rating triggers that could lead to a downgrade include: -- Elevated financial leverage measured by debt-to-total capital exceeding 35%  or debt-EBITDA above 1.8x;  -- Deterioration in capitalization, measured by an NAIC RBC ratio below 270% of  the CAL; -- Disruption in Cigna's earnings profile as evidenced by EBITDA/revenue below  8% and net return on average capital ratios below 10%. The key rating triggers that could result in an upgrade include: -- Lower financial leverage ratios, specifically debt-EBITDA better than 1.2x  and debt-to-total capital near 25%;  -- Stronger risk-based capitalization measured by a NAIC RBC ratio near 350% of  the company action level; -- Enhanced market position and size/scale comparable to peers rated in the 'AA'  category. Fitch has taken the following rating actions: Cigna Corp. --IDR upgraded to 'A-' from 'BBB+'; --Senior unsecured notes upgraded to 'BBB+' from 'BBB'. --Short-term IDR affirmed at 'F2'. Cigna Corp. Subsidiaries: Connecticut General Life Insurance Company Life Insurance Company of North America Cigna Life Insurance Company of New York Cigna Worldwide Insurance Company -- IFS upgraded to 'A+' from 'A'.

9,"  U.S. health insurer Cigna Corp (CI.N) said on Thursday that medical costs for its individual customers were higher than expected in the second quarter, adding to investor worries that spending is on the rise.Cigna shares fell 5 percent, and a sell-off begun early this week in other insurers including Aetna Inc (AET.N) and WellPoint Inc WLP.N continued. Investors are on the watch for any signs that medical spending, long at historical lows, is on the rise, which could limit insurer profits. Aetna's and Humana Inc's (HUM.N) quarterly results this week had also raised cost concerns.Cigna said medical costs as a percentage of total premiums collected from its fully insured commercial business came in higher than it had expected, driven by the rise in use among individual customers.Even so, Cigna lowered it overall medical cost growth expectations for 2014. Cigna has more than 100,000 individual customers with policies created by President Barack Obama's national healthcare reform law. The balance of its 275,000 to 300,000 individual customers are in plans that do not comply with the law but which have been extended for a year or more. Some insurers like WellPoint are profiting from the new individual business created by the law, but many including Cigna and Aetna say they are not.Cigna said that the first group of customers who signed up under the law are using more services like oncology and maternity than expected. There are some signs that customers who signed up near the April 1 close of enrollment on the exchanges are younger and healthier, it said. Still, Chief Executive Officer David Cordani said he sees long-term possibilities in the business and plans to offer plans in three additional states in 2015 for a total of eight. The declines in share prices for health insurers came even as Cigna's profit beat analysts' expectations, in line with the trend this quarter from larger competitors. Much of Cigna's healthcare business comes from fees it charges large corporations to manage plans for their employees. The company, which also has Medicare and Medicaid customers and sells dental, life and disability insurance, said growth in second-quarter profit was driven by higher revenue and by management of expenses and medical costs overall.  Cordani said he expects a continuation of a trend of low use among employer-based customers, in part due to collaborative efforts with doctors and more preventive services.Cigna lowered it medical cost growth expectations for 2014 to a range of 4.5 percent to 5.5 percent this year, below competitors. The company had previously forecast cost growth at 5 to 6 percent.For the quarter, Cigna's net income rose to $573 million, or $2.12 per share, from $505 million, or $1.76 per share, a year earlier. Excluding investment gains, the company earned $1.96 per share. Analysts, on average, expected $1.84, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Revenue rose 9 percent to $8.7 billion.Cigna had 13.8 million people in its commercial business, up from 13.6 million a year earlier.

13,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, September 22 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has published a new report detailing  key credit metrics of nine-publicly-traded U.S. health insurance and managed  care companies that are either rated or followed by Fitch: Aetna, Inc., Centene  Corp., Cigna Corp., Health Net Inc., Humana, Inc., Molina Health Care Inc.  UnitedHealth Group, Incorporated, WellCare Health Plans, Inc. and WellPoint,  Inc.  The report is meant to be used as a desktop guide, providing financial data and  rankings, key credit strengths and concerns, and current ratings levels and  rating sensitivities. Fitch views the key credit metrics of these nine publicly traded health insurers  as improving in the first half of 2014 compared to the prior year period. Strong  revenue growth driven by the Affordable Care Act's (ACA) exchanges and Medicaid  expansion, continuing popularity of Medicare Advantage products and  acquisition-related growth generated increases in EBITDA that more than offset  declining margins. Interest coverage ratios improved, and leverage ratios  declined modestly. The first section of the report includes company rankings based on revenue  growth, EBITDA margin and returns on capital as well as capitalization measures  such as debt-to-EBITDA and financial leverage. The second section of the report  provides a more detailed discussion of the nine individual companies including  credit strengths and concerns, ratings and rating triggers (where applicable),  and detailed information about each company's capital structure.

15,"   By Caroline Humer  Cigna Corp. said on Thursday that financial losses from the new Obamacare health insurance eased in the third quarter, becoming the second insurer this week to say that business was improving.The U.S. Affordable Care Act, often called Obamacare, created national exchanges that sell health plans to individuals regardless of age or health. Previously, individual plans could deny coverage to people and charge more based on age, health or gender.Cigna, Aetna Inc and Humana Inc have said since the beginning of the year that they were posting losses on the plans because their patients were older and sicker than what they had anticipated when they set premiums. Others, like WellPoint Inc., are making a profit, a fact WellPoint confirmed this week was the case in the third quarter. Humana reports next week.This week, Aetna said it had signed up more patients than it expected and it began making a slight profit on the business during the third quarter as the high volume helped defray fixed costs. On Thursday, Cigna CEO David Cordani said that while it was still losing money on the new patients, the rate of losses had slowed with a decrease in medical use by the first group of customers who had coverage in January as soon as the plans were available.  A second group who signed up later and appeared to be skewing to be healthier were also using medical services at a lower rate, he said.""The rate of loss decreased somewhat, but it is still a loss,"" Cordani said in an interview. ""There was somewhat of a decrease in the rate of acceleration of service consumption and a little more visibility into (government risk payments)."" REVENUE INCREASED Cigna, which manages insurance plans for large corporations for a fee and sells health plans on the government exchanges created under healthcare reform as well as dental and other benefits, said the company's total revenue increased to $8.8 billion from $8.1 billion.The company said revenue was held back by its exit from limited benefit plans, which are no longer allowed under Obamacare. It also said premium rates were pressured in its Medicare business for older people and the disabled. Cigna had 14.4 million medical customers at the end of September, up about 100,000 from a year earlier. The company reported a profit of $1.95 per share, excluding investment gains and the business it is exiting.

22,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, March 11 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'BBB+' rating to Cigna  Corp's (Cigna) planned issue of up to $900 million senior unsecured notes due  2025. The rating is equivalent to Fitch's ratings on Cigna's currently  outstanding senior notes. Cigna is expected to use issuance proceeds to redeem all outstanding $600  million 2.75% notes due in 2016 and $251 million 8.5% notes due in 2019 with any  remaining proceeds being used for general corporate purposes. The company has  estimated that $936 million is required to redeem both of these issues in their  entirety.  KEY RATING DRIVERS The rating reflects expectations that the net effect of the planned issuance and  redemptions will not materially change Cigna's financial leverage and interest  coverage ratios from levels reported at year-end 2014.  Cigna's ratings reflect the company's large market position, solid profitability  and well capitalized operating subsidiaries. Balanced against these strengths is  the company's high financial leverage ratio. Cigna's debt-to-EBITDA was 1.2x at Dec. 31, 2014, exceeding Fitch's median  guideline for the current rating category. Cigna's financial leverage ratio was  35% at Dec. 31, 2014 and remains elevated relative to Fitch's guideline of 28%  for the current rating category. Fitch expects the debt-to-total capital ratio  to gradually be reduced through capital retention toward the 30% range. Consistently solid profitability and interest coverage are key rating components  partially offsetting the rating implications of high financial leverage. During  2014 EBITDA/revenue was 11.9% and return on capital was 13.4%. Both ratios are  better than Fitch's guidelines for the 'A' rating category.  Operating EBITDA covered interest expense by 15 times during 2014, which is  above the company's recent low double digits average. Interest coverage exceeded  Fitch's median guideline for Cigna's current rating category. RATING SENSITIVITIES: The key rating triggers that could lead to a downgrade include: --Elevated financial leverage measured by debt-to-total capital exceeding 35% or  debt-EBITDA above 1.8x;  --Deterioration in capitalization, measured by an NAIC RBC ratio below 270% of  the CAL; --Disruption in Cigna's earnings profile as evidenced by EBITDA/revenue below  8.0x and net return on average capital ratios below 10%. The key rating triggers that could result in an upgrade include: --Lower financial leverage ratios, specifically debt-EBITDA better than 1.2x and  debt-to-total capital near 25%;  --Stronger risk-based capitalization measured by a NAIC RBC ratio near 350% of  the company action level; --Enhanced market position and size/scale comparable to peers rated in the 'AA'  category. Fitch has assigned the following rating: --$900 million senior unsecured notes maturing in 2025 'BBB+'  Fitch took no action on the following ratings: Cigna Corp. --Issuer Default Rating 'A-'; --Senior unsecured notes 'BBB+'; --Short-term IDR 'F2'.

23,"   By Caroline Humer | NEW YORK, April 12  NEW YORK, April 12 Medical researchers call it the ""Angelina Effect,"" the surge in demand for genetic testing attributable to movie star Angelina Jolie's public crusade for more aggressive detection of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer.But there's a catch: Major insurance companies including Aetna, Anthem and Cigna are declining to pay for the latest generation of tests, known as multi-gene panel tests, Reuters has learned. The insurers say that the tests are unproven and may lead patients to seek out medical care they don't need.That's a dangerous miscalculation, a range of doctors, genetic counselors, academics and diagnostics companies said. While they acknowledge that multi-gene tests produce data that may not be useful from a diagnostic standpoint, they say that by refusing or delaying coverage, insurance companies are endangering patients who could be undergoing screenings or changing their diets if they knew about the possible risks.The tests have come a long way since Jolie, 39, went public in 2013, revealing that she underwent a double mastectomy after a genetic test found she carried mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, indicating a high risk of breast and ovarian cancer. She disclosed last month that she had her ovaries and fallopian tubes removed.The new panel tests, which can cost between $2,000 to $4,900, analyze 20 or more genes at once. That allows healthcare professionals to establish possible DNA links to other cancer-related conditions such as Lynch syndrome and Li-Fraumeni Syndrome earlier. Humans have about 23,000 genes.Susan Kutner, a surgeon at a Kaiser Permanente hospital in San Jose, California, who serves on a U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advisory committee on young women and breast cancer, said more women with a family history of cancer should be able get these tests.""If we have members who are not being tested in a timely manner, we know that their risk of cancer in the long run costs us and them a lot more,"" Kutner said.Kaiser, which insures its own members, covers panel tests for patients with family histories of cancer.That's not so at three of the four largest managed care companies. Aetna Inc, Anthem Inc and Cigna Corp  state in their policies that in most cases they don't cover multi-gene panel tests. The fourth, UnitedHealth Group, covers the tests if patients meet certain criteria. All insurers cover screenings for BRCA1 and BRCA2 and for certain other genes for women who have family histories of cancer. Indeed, such coverage is mandated by the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare.But many insurers said they simply don't know enough about the specific risk of other mutations to justify coverage of the new family of tests.They also say that the tests may find mutations with a well-established link to a disease, but which are difficult to interpret. These results could lead to patients taking misguided actions about medical care, such as preventive chemotherapy and surgery.Aetna's medical director of quality management, Robert McDonough, said Aetna pays for testing of individual genes but that ""the routine application of a panel would be considered unproven.""Cigna's David Finley, national medical officer for enterprise affordability, said multi-gene tests are more likely to find unknown mutations for which there are no care guidelines. ""This is where there is controversy and disagreement,"" Finley said. ""My problem is what do you do with that information?""Instead, he said, there need to be more clinical trials and research to establish exact risks and medical guidelines for each type of gene mutation.Healthcare professionals said that while they recognize the downside of patients getting unclear information about their genetic makeup, genetic counseling and support from doctors can mitigate risks.CATCH-22  Mary Daly, a physician who chairs the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines panel for breast and ovarian cancer, oversees the process for setting guidelines that most doctors in this field follow. She points to what is, in effect, a ""Catch 22:"" Without insurance coverage of these tests, there isn't enough data to analyze how effective they are.""If we don't start looking at these genes, we'll never obtain the data we need,"" she said.Leading academics in genetic research also dispute the claim that multi-gene tests produce too much confusing information, saying they often lead to beneficial steps such as cancer screenings.""The utility of panel testing is that we know there are a lot more genes beyond BRCA1 and BRCA2 that are associated with cancer predisposition,"" said Colin Pritchard, a University of Washington geneticist.Pritchard said the understanding of the link between genetic mutations and cancer is evolving quickly. A recent study in the New England Journal of Medicine established rates of breast cancer associated with a mutation in one of the genes included in many of these panel tests, known as the PALB2 gene.Hereditary cancers are expected to account for about 5 percent of the 230,000 cases of invasive breast cancer that will be diagnosed this year in the United States. In the year Jolie went public about her testing, an AARP Public Policy Institute study found that BRCA testing had risen 40 percent. Jolie's spokesperson did not return a call requesting comment on the multi-gene testing trend.Myriad Genetics Inc, which accounts for 90 percent of the hereditary cancer-testing market, said 15 of the 25 genes that National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines indicate should be included in multi-gene testing are in its ""MyRisk"" panel test. The business represents a $5 billion global market opportunity for Myriad, the company said in January.Other lab companies including Ambry Genetics, Quest Diagnostics Inc  and Invitae Corp each offer a variety of panels that start at about seven genes and go up to 40 genes.""In general, the trend is moving toward more genes,"" said Carin Espenschied, a senior products manager at Ambry and a genetic counselor.

The insurers say that the tests are unproven and may lead patients to seek out medical care they don't need.That's a dangerous miscalculation, a range of doctors, genetic counselors, academics and diagnostics companies said. While they acknowledge that multi-gene tests produce data that may not be useful from a diagnostic standpoint, they say that by refusing or delaying coverage, insurance companies are endangering patients who could be undergoing screenings or changing their diets if they knew about the possible risks.The tests have come a long way since Jolie, 39, went public in 2013, revealing that she underwent a double mastectomy after a genetic test found she carried mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, indicating a high risk of breast and ovarian cancer. She disclosed last month that she had her ovaries and fallopian tubes removed.The new panel tests, which can cost between $2,000 to $4,900, analyze 20 or more genes at once.

They also say that the tests may find mutations with a well-established link to a disease, but which are difficult to interpret. These results could lead to patients taking misguided actions about medical care, such as preventive chemotherapy and surgery.Aetna's medical director of quality management, Robert McDonough, said Aetna pays for testing of individual genes but that ""the routine application of a panel would be considered unproven.""Cigna's David Finley, national medical officer for enterprise affordability, said multi-gene tests are more likely to find unknown mutations for which there are no care guidelines.  ""This is where there is controversy and disagreement,"" Finley said.

37,"   By Caroline Humer | NEW YORK  NEW YORK U.S. health insurer Anthem Inc (ANTM.N) said on Saturday it had offered $47 billion in cash and stock for smaller rival Cigna Corp (CI.N), signaling a pick-up in the industry's long-awaited consolidation.The biggest U.S. health insurers are seeking acquisitions to boost membership in government-paid healthcare plans and the employer-based insurance that is Cigna's specialty. Being bigger can help them negotiate better prices and improved networks of doctors, they said.Anthem's offer comes as Cigna, as well as insurer Aetna Inc (AET.N), are participating in an auction to acquire another rival, Humana Inc (HUM.N), according to a person familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because the sale process is confidential. Humana was first reported to be considering a sale in May.Humana declined to comment. Aetna was not immediately available for comment. Cigna declined to comment on the Humana auction or the Anthem offer.Anthem, the second largest U.S. health insurer, said in a statement it had made four offers for Cigna in June, but that the deal was stalled over Cigna Chief Executive David Cordani's role in the merged company. The Wall Street Journal first reported on the rejected offers last week.In a letter published as part of the company's statement on Saturday, Anthem detailed its weeks-long attempts to reach a deal with Cigna, including the steps by which it raised its offer to $184 per share. Based on that price and 257,370,000 shares outstanding, the deal is worth about $47 billion.Cigna shares closed on Friday at $155.26, down $1.15 or 0.7 percent, making the $184 offer a premium of about 18 percent. The offer consists of 68.6 percent cash and 31.4 percent stock. CEO Joseph Swedish wrote that the company did not think investors supported Cigna's rejection of the deal because of Anthem's refusal to guarantee that the CEO role would eventually go to Cordani. The letter also said Cigna had refused to sign a two-week standstill agreement with Anthem that would prevent both sides from having other deal talks.A combined Cigna and Anthem would have 53 million customers in commercial, government, consumer and other kinds of health insurance plans. Anthem, which offers Blue Cross Blue Shield plans in 14 states, said the purchase would boost earnings more than 10 percent in the first year and double that in the second year.DEAL MAKING   The deal making comes as insurance companies have adjusted to the major changes introduced by President Barack Obama's national healthcare reform law, which has created new kinds of insurance, cut government payments for medical services and introduced new healthcare taxes. The news broke in May that Humana, which specializes in Medicare Advantage plans for older people and the disabled, was considering selling itself, a source familiar with the matter said.The Wall Street Journal last month reported that Aetna and Cigna were possible buyers. Both companies declined to comment on the report at the time. Last week, the Journal reported that Cigna had turned down Anthem after two offers and also said UnitedHealth Group Inc was interested in buying Aetna.Aetna itself has for years been speculated to be a buyer for Cigna, but Wall Street analysts have said one barrier would be finding a role for the CEO of each company. Leerink Partners analyst Ana Gupte said she thought the Anthem-Cigna deal would close and that Aetna had an 80 percent or more chance of buying Humana. She also wrote in a research note that she expects UnitedHealth to try to buy Aetna, but that it could face too many regulatory barriers.Regulatory issues would likely not be an issue with Anthem as the buyer and Cigna as a target, Wall Street analysts have said, while Anthem and Humana is another combination that could pass regulatory scrutiny. Swedish wrote in a letter to Cigna's board that Anthem had proposed that Cordani could be president and chief operating officer of the new company during a two-year period while Swedish remained CEO. After that time, Swedish said he would step down and that the board could appoint a new CEO.

If two deals were announced in the insurance industry, that would likely trigger more scrutiny from antitrust enforcers,  said Barak Richman, who teaches at Duke University School of Law. ""The economics of the health insurance market makes it a complicated analysis. These are not doomed transactions,"" Richman said.The Justice Department has been aggressive, one expert said, pointing to Comcast’s failed bid for Time Warner Cable.

The Blue Cross Blue Shield Association is made up of 37 different health plans, of which Anthem is the largest, who work together to create a national network of health insurance coverage.""We believe there is a consensus of where there is overlap between our companies and that no substantive antitrust or insurance regulatory issues are present that would prevent completion of the transaction,"" Anthem CEO Joseph Swedish said during a conference call.Anthem and Cigna overlap in several lines of the insurance business, including Medicare for older people and the disabled, as well as insurance for companies and in administering insurance benefits for large employers who provide health plans. For instance, according to an analyst report from Wall Street firm Oppenheimer, the companies may need to address overlap in the large group insurance market in Indiana, Maine and New Hampshire, where combined they would have more than 40 percent of the market.The U.S. Department of Justice will look at how the proposed combination - with deal values estimated in the tens of billions of dollars - would increase market share in each county or region for each type of health insurance plan that the companies offer, antitrust experts say. They may need to review a second deal at the same time. Humana Inc has sought to sell itself through an auction process and both Cigna and Aetna are participating, a source familiar with the situation previously told Reuters.""It's a dynamic analysis, right? There's a lot going on here. There's a lot that can happen and it (the antitrust review) really is market by market, geography by geography, product line by product line,"" said Jonathan Lewis, an antitrust lawyer at BakerHostetler in Washington DC. Lewis predicted ""a long review process.""Cigna shares were trading up 5.7 percent at $164.18 Monday while Anthem shares were up 4.3 percent at $172.11.

52,"   By Greg Roumeliotis and Pamela Barbaglia | NEW YORK/LONDON, June 29  NEW YORK/LONDON, June 29 Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) worldwide in the second quarter of 2015 almost matched the record set in the second quarter of 2007, according to preliminary Thomson Reuters data, as big companies turned to deals to boost their market share.Low interest rates and stronger confidence among chief executives have led to a steady rise in M&A activity in the last two years to close to pre-2008 financial crisis levels. The second quarter of 2015, however, stands out for the number of mega deals that were clinched or attempted.These include Royal Dutch Shell Plc's $70 billion acquisition of British rival BG Group Plc, cable operator Charter Communications Inc's $78.7 billion merger with Time Warner Cable Inc, and chip maker Avago Technologies Ltd's $37 billion acquisition of peer Broadcom Corporation.Such large deals drove M&A volumes globally in the second quarter of 2015 up by 34.6 percent year-on-year to $1.33 trillion as of June 26, shy of the record $1.41 trillion seen in the second quarter of 2007.""Given the consolidation that is going on across numerous sectors, to be a bystander could mean losing ground from a competitive standpoint,"" said Gary Posternack, global head of mergers and acquisitions at Barclays Plc.""Companies are mapping out their industry landscapes, focusing on transactions that could position themselves as industry leaders, and acting aggressively to try to bring them to fruition,"" Posternack added. Consolidation was often sparked by one company exploring a sale and spurring its rivals into action. In the United States, for example, health insurer Humana Inc's decision to put itself on the block prompted peers Cigna Corp, Aetna Inc , Anthem Inc and UnitedHealth Group Inc  to also explore other deals.To be sure, there were several takeover approaches in the quarter that were rebuffed. Cigna has so far snubbed Anthem's $53.8 billion acquisition proposal, natural gas pipeline company Williams Companies Inc rejected a $53.1 billion offer from peer Energy Transfer Equity LP, and generic drug maker Mylan NV is resisting a roughly $50 billion bid by  Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd, while also seeking to acquire rival Perrigo Company Plc in a hostile $35 billion bid.""The public markets have become more receptive to companies taking control of another company in a transformational way, even when the target may be reluctant to sell or merge,"" said Robin Rankin, global M&A co-head at Credit Suisse Group AG . STRATEGIC DEALS A major difference between the recent M&A boom and that  seen in 2007 is that the latter was to a large extent fueled by private equity-backed leveraged buyouts, as opposed to this year's strategic corporate deals. In fact, the first half of 2015 has seen the slowest six-month period for private equity-backed acquisitions since 2012.""For private equity investors, one of the main issues is the limited supply of assets. They have money to put to work but it proves hard for them to compete against industry players or new money pools in fiercely competitive auctions,"" said Luigi Rizzo, head of M&A for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at Bank of America Corp Despite the near-record M&A volumes, and the frothy valuations that have accompanied them, dealmakers say companies that see a strong strategic rationale remain committed to acquisitions.""When you are in the boardroom, discussion is not generally focused on whether we are in a bubble or not, or how long will this M&A trend continue. The discussion is rather about fundamentals, what is happening to operations and how much is the business worth,"" said Stephen Arcano, M&A head at law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP.M&A volumes jumped in all three regions. More companies showed appetite for cross-border dealmaking, with U.S. agrochemicals company Monsanto Co launching a bid for Switzerland's Syngenta AG, and Potash Corp of Saskatchewan Inc going after German peer K+S AG .""Buyers are looking for growth and borders do not represent obstacles. If they can buy something in emerging markets, developed Asia or in Europe, that is consistent with their strategy, that will be what they want to do,"" said Bob Eatroff, Americas M&A co-head at Morgan Stanley.Macro-economic concerns such as Greece's debt crisis and China's interest rate policies did not dampen M&A sentiment in Europe and Asia in the second quarter. Dealmakers say this could change if concerns over Greece or other issue curb risk taking.""The market backdrop in Europe could be described as a form of surreal stability; markets are favorable, but there are potential risks on the horizon which may not yet have been factored in,"" said Robert Leitão, head of Rothschild's global financial advisory team.

55,"  (Adds no comment from Cigna, regulators involved in deal, paragraphs 2, 8)By Luciana LopezNEW YORK, July 3 Aetna Inc's $37 billion deal to buy smaller health insurer Humana Inc will face rigorous scrutiny from U.S. regulators, which antitrust experts said could also make other large-scale mergers in the sector more difficult.The Aetna-Humana tie-up would be the largest such deal among health insurers. Friday's announcement starts the clock on an examination by regulators of whether consumers will be hurt by diminished competition. Competition regulators include the Department of Justice and various state-level agencies.The deal follows weeks of intense discussions about potential combinations among the five biggest U.S. health insurers: Aetna, Humana, Cigna Corp, Anthem Inc  and UnitedHealth Group.Insurers want more leverage in a healthcare system that has seen major consolidation among hospitals and doctor practices, as well as mergers between medical device makers and other suppliers. The cost of new drugs has soared, and President Barack Obama's healthcare law has made it harder for insurers to pass on higher costs to customers.Last month, Anthem offered to buy Cigna for $47 billion. The combined company would have surpassed UnitedHealth to become the single largest U.S. health insurer.Cigna, which had also considered purchasing Humana, has so far rejected the buyout approach. Some industry watchers expect a potential buyout of Cigna to be revived after Aetna's deal.Industry sources said Cigna and Anthem may have just a few months to sign a deal if they want it to be considered by antitrust authorities along with the Aetna-Humana deal. Cigna declined to comment about the Aetna-Humana deal. Anthem said it had nothing to say about other potential mergers.Regulators ""should be exceedingly skeptical of this deal"" between Aetna and Humana, said Diana Moss, president of the American Antritrust Institute. ""Depending on who merges and the change to the market structure, that affects the concerns about the competition.""Aetna said it is ready to address regulatory concerns.""Obviously this is something that we expect will get a thorough and careful review,"" Shawn Guertin, Aetna's chief financial officer, said in an interview. ""We've spent a lot of time looking at this at a fairly detailed level, and we certainly think that's a manageable situation."" Guertin conceded that a combined company could have some overlap, but declined to name possible divestitures that regulators might seek.""We're in the same business at the highest level, and so there certainly is an overlap in that regard,"" he said.""It's really about local markets,"" Guertin said. RECENT DEALS SCUTTLED Antitrust experts said a regulatory review of Aetna and Humana could also factor in whether there is another major deal in the industry.Regulators are expected to scrutinize how competition in local markets will be affected for each line of insurance: Medicare for the elderly, Medicaid for the poor, individual insurance, commercial insurance for small and large business and the large employer business.Regulators have recently scuttled deals in other industries that would have created mega players. In April, Comcast Corp abandoned its $45 billion offer for Time Warner Cable Inc because of antitrust worries.This month, the U.S. Justice Department sued to stop Sweden's Electrolux AB from buying General Electric Co's appliance business.""Agencies are becoming increasingly skeptical about whether you can remedy anti-competitive mergers by having some kind of divestiture,"" said David Balto, formerly the policy director of the Bureau of Competition of the Federal Trade Commission.Mergers might give insurers more punch to negotiate lower prices with pharmaceutical companies, Balto said. But he called that a ""Faustian bargain.""""Maybe they have more buying power, but then they're going to have more selling power.""

59,"  (Recasts to include merger talk)By Caroline HumerJuly 16 UnitedHealth Group Inc, the largest U.S. health insurer, on Thursday forecast higher profit and said medical costs were under control, pushing off any discussion about its role in a frenzy of insurer consolidation.UnitedHealth is the first of the national health insurers to report second quarter earnings amid dealmaking in the industry. Aetna Inc and Humana Inc have recently struck a deal, and Anthem Inc is in pursuit of Cigna Corp . UnitedHealth has also been reported to have looked at Aetna and Cigna.Companies are having to adjust to the national healthcare reform law, the Affordable Care Act, and have sought to cut costs and grow larger to use size to negotiate better contracts with doctors.""We are well positioned across virtually all of the key markets and...have plenty of scale across all our business segments,"" Chief Executive Stephen Helmsley told investors on a conference call. ""We are just going to continue to run our business."" UnitedHealth said medical cost trends remained controlled and were consistent with management expectations. The company's medical loss ratio - or percentage of premiums paid out for medical services - was 81.4 percent, a decline of 20 basis points but 60 basis points higher than Wall Street estimates.Shares fell about 1.8 percent after missing Wall Street cost estimates. They recovered some ground as the company attributed the shortfall to a miscalculation by the Street on the mix of its business.Executives said customer medical costs were higher for  Medicaid, Medicare and exchanges, where enrollment grew, than in the commercial sector. Disappointment that it did not announce a deal with its earnings report may have influenced the shares as well.""Certainly there has been speculation about what United is doing, or saying to Cigna,"" Leerink Partners analyst Ana Gupte said.The company said it expected medical spending to increase in the lower half of a range of 5.5 percent to 6.5 percent.

68,"   By Ankur Banerjee and Ransdell Pierson  Anthem Inc said on Friday it would buy Cigna Corp for about $54.2 billion, creating the largest U.S. health insurer by membership and accelerating the industry's consolidation from five national players to three.The proposed acquisition, the health insurance industry's largest, comes three weeks after Aetna Inc agreed to buy Humana Inc for $37 billion.Health insurers are finding it tougher to raise prices following the roll-out of President Barack Obama's healthcare law, while grappling with soaring expenses of medications including cancer drugs that can cost each patient more than $100,000 a year. Anthem said buying Cigna would help it reduce costs and negotiate lower prices with doctors and hospitals.State insurance regulators and federal antitrust authorities are expected to scrutinize how the Anthem-Cigna and Aetna-Humana deals would affect competition for Medicare and individual and commercial insurance.Within a few hours of the announcement, several U.S. lawmakers and a leading physicians group said they feared the pending acquisitions would hurt consumers by raising prices or limiting access to healthcare providers.""The lack of a competitive health insurance market allows the few remaining companies to exploit their market power, dictate premium increases and pursue corporate policies that are contrary to patient interests,"" the American Medical Association (AMA) said in a statement.Under the deal, which the companies expect to close in the second half of 2016, Anthem Chief Executive Joseph Swedish would serve as CEO and chairman. Cigna CEO David Cordani would be president and chief operating officer.In a joint conference call, Swedish told analysts Anthem had no prior discussions ""at all"" with regulators about the deal, but was confident about approval.Shares of Cigna on Friday fell 5.6 percent to $145.72, far below the $188 offered in the buyout, suggesting major Wall Street concern over the antitrust risk. ""Strategically and financially it's very attractive, but they will face regulatory scrutiny,"" said Ana Gupte, analyst with Leerink Partners. ""They also both possibly face divestitures and may have to make concessions to consumers to make the merger go through.""The AMA said its own analysis shows 41 percent of U.S. metropolitan areas already have a single health insurer with a commercial market share of 50 percent or more. It believes the Anthem-Cigna merger would be presumed anticompetitive in at least nine of the states where Anthem operates. ""It is imperative that we closely examine changes in the healthcare market, and what has caused these changes, to ensure that consumers are not harmed,"" said Senator Mike Lee, a Republican from Utah who is chairman of the Senate's antitrust panel.Apparent worries about regulatory scrutiny have also hit Humana shares, which closed at $181.76 on Friday, well below the value of Aetna's cash-and-stock offer of $230 per share when it was announced on July 3.BIGGER THAN UNITEDHEALTH Cigna has 15 million members, and about 80 percent of its business is with self-insured companies which pay it a management fee, according to Leerink. It also serves large and small employers, Medicare Advantage customers and individuals. About 61 percent of Anthem's 39 million members are served through self-insured companies, while 15 percent have Medicaid coverage. Large and small group policies make up about 12 percent of its business, while Medicare Advantage accounts for 1 percent.The combined company would have about 53 million members, surpassing UnitedHealth Group's 45.86 million as of June 30.Anthem said it will pay $103.40 in cash and 0.5152 of its shares for each Cigna share. The deal is valued at $181.12 per share based on Anthem's Friday close of $150.86.    Anthem said on Friday the offer was valued at $188 per share based on its stock price on May 28 before media reports surfaced that the two companies were in talks.The offer's equity portion is valued at $49.11 billion, according to Reuters calculations based on 261.2 million Cigna shares outstanding as of March 31.Another question is whether Anthem would violate rules of  the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association, a federation of 36 independent insurers of which it is the biggest member. The association collectively insures 106 million Americans. Anthem provides coverage to the most people and operates in 14 states. No other Blue Cross member operates in more than five states.Blue Cross operators are not supposed to compete with one another, but Cigna does compete against Blue Cross members in a handful of states, which could cause controversy in the association.""There will no doubt be debate among the board of directors,"" said a person knowledgeable about Blue Cross who requested anonymity to protect business relationships.""We will remain Blue,"" Swedish said on the conference call, adding that Anthem feels confident that even after acquiring Cigna, the combined company will satisfy ""the Blue rules.""Swedish said he would serve as CEO for only two years, and remain as chairman afterward. Cordani could be a contender for the CEO role at that point, but no guarantees were provided, said a source familiar with the matter who requested anonymity because the person was unauthorized to publicly discuss details of the transaction.Both Anthem and Cigna would be liable to pay the other a fee equivalent to 3.8 percent of the deal's value if either walks away from the planned merger.Anthem's lead financial adviser is UBS Investment Bank. Credit Suisse also served as financial adviser, and White & Case LLP as legal adviser. Morgan Stanley is Cigna's financial adviser and Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP its legal adviser.

72,"  * Combined company would be No. 1 insurer, cover 53 mln members* Antitrust review would include proposed Aetna buy of Humana* U.S. lawmakers, medical group express concern for consumers   (Adds details on antitrust review, concerns from lawmakers, Breakingviews link)By Ankur Banerjee and Ransdell PiersonJuly 24 Anthem Inc said on Friday it would buy Cigna Corp for about $54.2 billion, creating the largest U.S. health insurer by membership and accelerating the industry's consolidation from five national players to three.The proposed acquisition, the health insurance industry's largest, comes three weeks after Aetna Inc agreed to buy Humana Inc for $37 billion.Health insurers are finding it tougher to raise prices following the roll-out of President Barack Obama's healthcare law, while grappling with soaring expenses of medications including cancer drugs that can cost each patient more than $100,000 a year. Anthem said buying Cigna would help it reduce costs and negotiate lower prices with doctors and hospitals.State insurance regulators and federal antitrust authorities are expected to scrutinize how the Anthem-Cigna and Aetna-Humana deals would affect competition for Medicare and individual and commercial insurance.Within a few hours of the announcement, several U.S. lawmakers and a leading physicians group said they feared the pending acquisitions would hurt consumers by raising prices or limiting access to healthcare providers.""The lack of a competitive health insurance market allows the few remaining companies to exploit their market power, dictate premium increases and pursue corporate policies that are contrary to patient interests,"" the American Medical Association (AMA) said in a statement.Under the deal, which the companies expect to close in the second half of 2016, Anthem Chief Executive Joseph Swedish would serve as CEO and chairman. Cigna CEO David Cordani would be president and chief operating officer.In a joint conference call, Swedish told analysts Anthem had no prior discussions ""at all"" with regulators about the deal, but was confident about approval.Shares of Cigna on Friday fell 5.6 percent to $145.72, far below the $188 offered in the buyout, suggesting major Wall Street concern over the antitrust risk. ""Strategically and financially it's very attractive, but they will face regulatory scrutiny,"" said Ana Gupte, analyst with Leerink Partners.

77,"  (Adds Saunders interview)By Caroline HumerNEW YORK, July 27 Allergan plc CEO Brent Saunders is ready to put the $36 billion his company will net from the sale of its generics business to Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd to work, possibly with another large, ""transformational"" merger.The readiness for a new transaction just after the Teva deal was announced on Monday represents what Saunders calls a strategy to remain nimble and open to opportunity as the healthcare sector remakes itself.Saunders has already shown a penchant for quick deal-making. Just last year, he helped orchestrate the $25 billion sale of Forest Laboratories Inc, where he was CEO, to Actavis Plc.As head of Actavis, he then sealed a $66 billion purchase of Botox-maker Allergan, beating out rival suitor Valeant Pharmaceuticals and its acquisition partner, hedge fund billionaire William Ackman.The latest deal had just closed in March and Saunders was busy integrating the two companies under the Allergan name. At the time, he did not consider unloading the generics assets of Actavis.""While I had a different strategy a few months ago, the thing that sets us apart ... is our strategy to be nimble,"" Saunders said in an interview. Saunders now plans to use the proceeds from its $40.5 billion asset sale to Teva to increase the size of existing drug businesses, expand into new therapy areas and pursue larger deals.He declined to discuss any specific targets, a list Wall Street that analysts speculated may include Biogen Inc, AbbVie Inc and Amgen Inc.""Clearly we are watching many companies - we have been for some time - but what has changed is our timeline for being able to execute has accelerated, if the opportunity presents itself,"" Saunders said.The $40.5 billion cash-and-stock sale of generic drugs business to Teva is expected to close in the first quarter of 2016. That will essentially ""reload"" Allergan's balance sheet for more acquisitions, Saunders added. When asked if Allergan planned to spend the cash within 18 months, he replied that the company would, as long as it could maintain its investment-grade credit rating.CONSOLIDATION AHEAD Saunders said his change of direction for Allergan came only a few weeks ago when Teva CEO Erez Vigodman called to make an offer. Vigodman had already approached Actavis earlier in the year, but the company was not interested at that time. ""To be fair, I didn't think it was a good idea to sell it until Erez called me and put a compelling offer on the table,"" Saunders said. ""It caused me to step back and think about the industry and the dynamics.""The healthcare industry has consolidated in the past year, with pharmacies and distributors aligning through merger deals or purchasing agreements that give them more leverage over prices for generic drugs.These deals, such as CVS Health's purchases of Target Corp's pharmacies and the Omnicare specialty pharmacies and distributor McKesson Corp's purchasing agreement with pharmacy Rite Aid Corp, will force more consolidation among generics makers so they can compete, Saunders said.Two of the largest U.S. health insurers - Humana Inc  and Cigna Corp - have also agreed to be bought in the past month, signaling fresh pressure on prices, Saunders said.Of the seven main therapeutic areas that Allergan will focus on after the generics sale, he said there are four with the strongest opportunities in terms of unmet medical care: aesthetics, eye care, central nervous system therapies and gastrointestinal therapies.Les Funtleyder, healthcare portfolio manager for E Squared Asset Management, which owns Allergan shares, said Saunders should look for something with a reasonable risk versus reward profile.""If it were my $40 billion, I would probably do four or five deals in the $10 billion range, aiming for late-stage drug programs where you have some idea if the drug works,"" Funtleyder said. If two of those deals panned out, ""that would be a good use of capital.""

78,"  (Updates deal value to exclude debt in 1st, 6th paragraphs, updates stock action)By Caroline HumerJuly 29 Health insurer Anthem Inc, which plans to buy rival Cigna Corp for $47 billion, on Wednesday said medical costs, particularly in its Medicaid and Medicare businesses, were at the low end of expectations and helped boost second-quarter profit.Anthem raised its profit outlook for 2015 and said it expects health spending to increase at the lower end of a range of 6.5 percent to 7.5 percent this year. It also said that a key financial measure of medical costs fell during the quarter.Health insurers closely manage costs to contend with a constant rise in medical spending. Cost increases had been held back for many years by the weak economy, but began picking up in 2014 with the improved economy and as the national healthcare reform law extended insurance to millions more people.A few months ago, the largest U.S. insurers began scrambling to line up merger partners that would give them leverage to contend with the trend and negotiate lower prices with medical providers.Consolidation has heated up across the healthcare industry, including among hospitals, doctor groups, pharmacy benefit managers, pharmacies and drugmakers. On July 3, No. 3 health insurer Aetna Inc said it would buy rival Humana Inc and Anthem on Friday said it would acquire Cigna for $47 billion in cash and stock to create the No. 1 U.S. health insurer with 53 million members.Anthem, which operates Blue Cross Blue Shield plans in more than a dozen states, said on Wednesday that spending on medical claims as a percentage of premiums fell to 82.1 percent from 82.7 percent a year ago. That is about 30 basis points better than Wall Street estimates, according to Leerink Partners analyst Ana Gupte.Anthem is the first insurer to report earnings since UnitedHealth Group Inc two weeks ago missed analyst expectations for that key ratio, a harbinger of cost increases.""(Anthem's) loss ratios came in very favorably. That's a big plus considering there were some concerns about the UnitedHealth report,"" Gupte said. Anthem shares were up 0.24 percent at $154.77.REVENUE TOPS EXPECTATIONS  Anthem's net income rose to $859.1 million, or $3.13 per share, from $731.1 million, or $2.56 per share, a year earlier. Revenue increased 8.3 percent to $20.02 billion, topping analysts' expectations of $19.63 billion.The company cited strong growth in its government Medicaid and Medicare businesses, where revenue rose 25.7 percent. Medicaid membership increased 11 percent.Medicaid enrollments began to increase in earnest starting in July of last year as the expansion of Medicaid coverage for the poor kicked in, Anthem Chief Financial Officer Wayne DeVeydt said during a conference call.Anthem expects 2015 adjusted net income to be more than $10 per share, up from its previous forecast of more than $9.90.Analysts expected full-year earnings of $10.11 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Excluding items, Anthem earned $3.10 per share in the second quarter, well above the average analyst estimate of $2.77.

80,"   By Caroline Humer  Health insurer Cigna Corp, which agreed last week to be bought by Anthem Inc for $47 billion, said on Thursday that medical services use was low in the second quarter, helping to keep costs in check and beat Wall Street profit estimates.Cigna's report of a continued low utilization trend backs up a growing industry view of this closely watched component of insurer profitability. Anthem made similar comments on Wednesday, when it reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings.Health insurers have benefited from low medical services use during the past five years as the weak economy has kept down doctor visits and hospitalizations and membership growth has helped increase revenues.But the rate of overall health spending has begun to increase and medical use is expected to rise more as the economy improves. The national healthcare reform law, also known as Obamacare, has contributed to the increase as millions of people gained health insurance coverage in the past two years.That is driving insurers to consolidate to build scale to help keep costs down and negotiate better deals with doctors and hospitals.""The reason why there is so much consolidation is because utilization and the cost trend overall will go up, which will pressure the profitability for these companies long term,"" Morningstar Research analyst Vishnu Lekraj said. Aetna Inc agreed to buy smaller rival Humana Inc in early July, just weeks before Anthem and Cigna reached a deal.The mergers are expected to face antitrust scrutiny as regulators consider their effect on insurance premium rates. The concerns have kept Cigna shares far from Anthem's offer price of more than $183.Cigna shares dipped 0.4 percent at $144.81 on Thursday.Cigna Chief Executive Officer David Cordani said on CNBC on Thursday that the companies were already talking to state and federal regulators. ""We will fully engage with state leaders and federal leaders and those conversations have already started,"" Cordani said. Cigna said its ratio of medical claims paid as a percentage of premiums taken in, or MCR, was 77.5 percent for its commercial business and 84.4 percent for its government business. It expects medical costs to rise 5 percent to 6 percent in 2015.Net profit rose to $588 million, or $2.26 per share, for the second quarter, from $573 million, or $2.12 per share, a year earlier.Excluding items, Cigna earned $2.55 per share, beating the average analyst estimate of $2.31, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. On Friday when it announced the Anthem deal, Cigna said second-quarter earnings would be at least $2.50 per share. Cigna manages insurance plans for large companies and sells health plans to individuals on government exchanges created under the U.S. Affordable Care Act. It also manages government Medicare and Medicaid plans.Premiums and fees in Cigna's commercial and government businesses rose 10 percent in the second quarter, boosted by the addition of 524,000 customers.Revenue rose about 9 percent to $9.49 billion, just below the average analyst estimate of $9.53 billion.

The company said it would focus on building scale in its existing markets in the United States, but was open to entering new markets. WellCare currently has greater presence in Florida, Georgia and Kentucky.Last month, Anthem Inc said it would buy Cigna Corp  and Aetna Inc announced the acquisition of Humana Inc.The deals could present acquisition opportunities for WellCare and rival Centene Corp as Anthem and Aetna might have to sell some Medicare Advantage plans to satisfy antitrust regulators. Centene, which has said it was looking to buy Medicare Advantage plans, is also acquiring Health Net Inc for $6.3 billion to scale up its government plans business.WellCare raised its adjusted earnings forecast for 2015 to $3.30-$3.45 per share from $3.15-$3.40.Memberships in the company's Medicaid plans, which offer government-sponsored insurance to low-income families, rose 10.8 percent to 2.4 million in the second quarter. Adjusted medical benefits ratio, the share of premium WellCare spends on claims, improved to 88.8 percent from 93.5 percent in the business.

92,"   By Caroline Humer | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Health insurer Anthem's planned $47 billion takeover of rival Cigna will not hurt consumers but increase choice and affordability, Cigna CEO David Cordani said, defending the merger against widespread criticism that it will harm competition.The Anthem-Cigna deal and a plan by Aetna Inc to buy Humana have come in the wake of the implementation of the Affordable Care Act and amid pressure on insurers to keep healthcare spending down for their biggest customers - employers and the U.S. government. ""It's going to increase choice, not decrease choice. It's going to increase affordability, not decrease affordability,"" Cordani told Reuters in an interview, saying results-oriented contracts with doctors and hospitals would help consumers be healthier and trim medical spending.Cordani said the biggest overlap in a combination of their $115 billion businesses is their large employer-based divisions and asset sales may be necessary to win regulatory approval, though he expects that would only be on a limited basis.""Divestitures through the DOJ process should be modest and manageable. And we've leaned on the conservative side of the business case that supports this,"" he said, but added it was too early to say what might be offered up. About 150 million Americans get their health insurance through their employers, many of which are large companies.In the past few weeks, both the American Medical Association and the American Hospital Association have issued written criticisms of the deal. Congress held a hearing on insurer competition last week and another hearing is scheduled in the Senate next week in which Anthem CEO Joseph Swedish and Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini are scheduled to appear.The company expects the Department of Justice review to take 12 to 18 months during which it will look at the extent of their overlap in market share for Medicaid for the poor, Medicare Advantage for seniors, individual insurance, small employers and large employers. Cordani said the detailed nature of the review would show few competitive issues. There was little geographical overlap in their Medicaid and Medicare businesses and he is also not anticipating issues with the individual business, where Cigna is a new player, nor with small employer-based plans.He added that insurers would not see outsized benefits from cutting costs through their combinations because customers typically demand that spending savings be passed onto them. So far, Cordani said, employers have been optimistic that the combination will enable them to combine the results-oriented care management programs for diseases like diabetes that Cigna has used to cut healthcare spending in Medicare and commercial plans, and combine them with the Anthem's strong Blue Cross Blue Shield networks. ""Within that, there may be deemed by the DOJ some overlap that is not acceptable and we'll deal with that,"" he said.On branding, he said that in a state like Georgia, where Cigna and Anthem both operate, the companies can continue with their Cigna and Anthem branded plans and designs.

93,"   By Brendan Pierson  Oct 9 Health insurer Cigna Corp on Friday agreed to drop its requirement that patients with HIV/AIDS get some of their medications exclusively through its mail-order pharmacy, settling a consumer lawsuit.California-based advocacy group Consumer Watchdog, which announced the settlement on Friday, had sued Cigna in April in Florida federal court on behalf of a Fort Lauderdale man. They claimed the mail-order requirement discriminated against HIV/AIDS patients in order to boost profits.When the settlement takes effect on Dec. 1, Cigna patients will be able to get their drugs at any in-network pharmacy.The group sought to represent a nationwide class of HIV/AIDS patients, but Cigna agreed to the settlement before the court certified the case as a class action.

97,"  (Recasts to focus on individual exchange business, adds CFO and analyst comments, share prices)By Caroline HumerOct 28 Health insurer Anthem Inc said on Wednesday that its Obamacare insurance business is being hampered by lower-than-anticipated enrollment due to fewer applicants than expected and cheaper premium rates at competitors.Anthem has been one of the biggest and most profitable insurers in the new individual market, which was overhauled in 2014 with new government subsidized plans sold on exchanges created under Obamacare. Now Anthem says that business will drag on profit growth in 2016 and could even affect its long-term 2018 financial target.The comments from the second-largest U.S. health insurer came in its third-quarter financial report, which showed that other government-based businesses had outperformed expectations.Shares of Anthem were down 5.1 percent at $137.35 in morning trading. Cigna Corp, which Anthem has announced plans to buy, was down 3.2 percent while shares of Aetna Inc, which reports on Thursday, were down 2.8 percent.""We're trending the wrong direction on enrollment,"" Anthem Chief Financial Officer Wayne DeVeydt told investors on a conference call. The company lost 69,000 exchange customers during the quarter, ending with 824,000 customers. It has 1.75 million total individual customers. Anthem, which operates Blue Cross Blue Shield plans in more than a dozen states, said it expects continued enrollment declines in the fourth quarter and that 2016 will be weak as competitors undercut prices. After that, it is counting on improvements in 2017 and 2018 when it expects to be able to compete better on prices.Many of its individual customers buy their insurance on the exchanges created under President Barack Obama's national healthcare reform law and receive subsidies from the government aimed at making it more affordable. The government expects about 9.1 million people to have this insurance at the end of 2015, a lower target than the 15 million it once aimed for, and for next year expects 10 million people to enroll.Earlier this week, the U.S. government said that in the 37 states where it runs exchanges, the monthly premium rate of the benchmark health insurance plan will increase 7.5 percent on average. DeVeydt said the company was not seeing what hospitals attested to this week: patients dropping coverage because of premium prices.Two weeks ago, UnitedHealth Group Inc disappointed investors when it told them the individual business was cutting into profit this year. Unlike Anthem, it said it expected 2016 to improve.Leerink Partners analyst Ana Gupte described Anthem's commentary on the call as being ""very cautious"" and noted the pressure from market share losses to other plans that had priced below them in 2016. Anthem said its other businesses did well as more people enrolled for its government plans in Medicare for the elderly and disabled and Medicaid for lower-income families. Medicaid enrollment rose by 786,000 members in the third quarter.Anthem said earnings rose to $654.8 million, or $2.43 per share, from $630.9 million, or $2.22 per share, a year earlier.The company said spending on medical claims as a percentage of premiums rose to 83.6 percent from 82.5 percent a year ago, due to expenses in its individual business. The metric is keenly watched for signs of rising costs.On an adjusted basis, Anthem earned $2.73 per share, well above analysts' average estimate of $2.33 according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Revenue rose to $19.77 billion from $18.37 billion. Analysts were expecting revenue of $19.64 billion.The company also forecast full-year profit of $10.10-$10.20 per share, below analysts' expectations of $10.22.

On Monday, the Institute for Supply Management will publish its survey of purchasing managers; poor sentiment there, coupled with a weak jobs report on Friday could paradoxically strengthen stocks if investors thought the Fed would sit tight on its zero interest rate policy.

Should the economic data come in strong, bonds and stocks could end the week with more selling than buying, while the dollar would strengthen against other major currencies.

103,"   By Simon Johnson and Diane Bartz | STOCKHOLM/WASHINGTON  STOCKHOLM/WASHINGTON General Electric on Monday walked away from a $3.3 billion agreement to sell its appliances business to Sweden's Electrolux, terminating the deal after months of opposition from U.S. antitrust regulators.  GE (GE.N) said it would pursue other suitors for its century-old appliance unit but declined to say who they might be. ""The appliances business is performing well and GE will continue to run the business while it pursues a sale,"" the company said in a statement. Shares of Electrolux, which sought to double its U.S. sales with the purchase, tumbled on the news, and the company said it will now focus on developing existing brands such as Frigidaire, Kenmore and Tappan and could look at other acquisitions. The U.S. Justice Department had filed a lawsuit in July asking a judge to stop the deal, arguing that it would push appliance prices up by 5 percent. Electrolux, GE and larger competitor Whirlpool (WHR.N) make up more than 90 percent of major kitchen appliances sold to homebuilders, according to the lawsuit.""This deal was bad for the millions of consumers who buy cooking appliances every year. Electrolux and General Electric could not overcome that reality at trial,"" said Deputy Assistant Attorney General David Gelfand of the department’s Antitrust Division.This has been a year of megadeals but also a year of aggressive deals killed by equally aggressive U.S. antitrust authorities.Dead deals include Comcast's (CMCSA.O) bid to buy Time Warner Cable TWC.N, Sysco's (SYY.N) plan to buy US Foods, Thai Union's plan to buy Bumble Bee tuna and Applied Materials' (AMAT.O) scrapped plan to merge with Tokyo Electron (8035.T). More mergers are under review including two insurance deals, Aetna's (AET.N) deal for Humana (HUM.N) and Anthem's (ANTM.N) planned merger with Cigna (CI.N), along with a deal between Baker Hughes (BHI.N) and Halliburton (HAL.N) and Staples' (SPLS.O) merger with Office Depot (ODP.O).Electrolux shares fell 13.4 percent to 207 Swedish crowns, the biggest fall by a European blue-chip stock on Monday. They earlier touched a 14-month low of 203.2 crowns. GE closed 0.4 percent lower at $30.37.FUTURE OF ELECTROLUX The acquisition of GE's appliance business would have seen Electrolux leapfrog Whirlpool as the world's biggest appliances maker, strengthening its position in North and South America. ""We're disappointed but we're certainly not defeated,"" Chief Executive Keith McLoughlin told a conference call.

128,"   By Caroline Humer | NEW YORK, April 19  NEW YORK, April 19 UnitedHealth Group Inc's  decision to exit most of its Obamacare health insurance exchanges next year means rivals will need to raise prices further to prop up an unprofitable business, healthcare analysts and policy experts said on Tuesday.The largest U.S. health insurer's move would likely reduce consumer choices, particularly in states where UnitedHealth has been one of only a handful of players to offer insurance under President Barack Obama's healthcare law, they said.Large pullbacks by providers like Anthem Inc and Aetna Inc are unlikely as they each await approval from the administration for proposed merger deals with smaller rivals, some analysts said.Spokespeople for Aetna and Anthem declined to comment on Tuesday.UnitedHealth is one of the biggest sellers of Obamacare plans, offering them in 34 states in 2016. The company warned in November that it was losing too much money on the business due to low enrollment and high service costs. On Tuesday, it said it would exit all but a handful of those markets.Many of the estimated 650,000 UnitedHealth plan members at the end of 2016 would need to find another insurer.""You will see significant rate increases for 2017 as the (health) plans try to figure out what is a premium at which (they) can make money,"" said Caroline Pearson, senior vice president at research firm Avalere Health. The government provides income-based tax credits to most exchange users, which would help soften the blow from any higher premiums, she said.""In terms of viability of the exchanges, I don't think that this is going to affect that in the long term,"" said Yevgeniy Feyman, deputy director of health policy at the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research.Even if other insurers decided to leave, he said, he could not envision the exchanges being so unprofitable that they ceased to work.A recent Kaiser Family Foundation study found UnitedHealth's departure would leave only one insurer in 29 percent of the 1,855 counties where it offered health plans. The report found that if United had not participated in the exchanges in 2016, the national weighted average benchmark ""silver"" plan would have been about 1 percent higher in 2016. Republican lawmakers have repeatedly sought to repeal the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, which provides tax credits to help uninsured individuals buy medical coverage. They have said it creates unwarranted government intervention in personal healthcare and have warned that insurers would be left to cover sicker and older individuals.TOUGH BUSINESS U.S. health insurers including Aetna and Anthem have also lost money on the exchanges, but have not said they would exit. The Obama administration estimates more than 12 million people signed up for private insurance on the exchanges for 2016.Insurers are in the midst of submitting proposed premium rates for 2017 ahead of mid-May deadlines set by state exchanges and insurance regulators. Aetna Chief Executive Officer Mark Bertolini has questioned whether the Obamacare business was sustainable, but said he was working with the government to improve it. Anthem CEO Joseph Swedish has said that the company was committed to the exchanges.""I would still be surprised if other major insurers followed United's lead. United was in some sense in a category all its own,"" Kaiser Family Foundation Senior Vice President Larry Levitt said.Health plans sold to individual members represented a small part of UnitedHealth's revenue compared to large-scale contracts with employers, while Aetna and Anthem both had substantial business serving individuals.Aetna and Anthem are undergoing a U.S. Department of Justice review of what would be an historic consolidation in the health insurance industry.

Ever since the deals were announced, investors have worried that one or both may not close because of antitrust issues.Anthem has not changed its expectations, Anthem spokeswoman Jill Becher said in a statement. ""Although our merger agreement with Cigna gives us until April 30, 2017 to obtain regulatory approvals, we continue to believe that we will obtain such approvals and close in the second half of 2016,"" she said.Cigna said in the filing that it continues to target closing in the second half of 2016 but that the closing hinges on regulators' timing and approval. ""In light of the complexity of the regulatory process and the dynamic environment, it is possible that such approvals may not be obtained in 2016,"" Cigna said in its first quarter financial filing on Friday.In a February regulatory filing it said that the merger was expected to close in the second half of 2016.

131,"   By Caroline Humer | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Health insurer Cigna Corp (CI.N), which announced plans to be bought by larger Anthem Inc (ANTM.N) 10 months ago, on Friday said the deal may close in 2017 rather than 2016 due to the complexity of the regulatory process, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.The U.S. Department of Justice is currently reviewing the Cigna-Anthem deal, which would create the nation's largest health insurer, offering Medicare, Medicaid and commercial health insurance. The Justice Department is reviewing that deal in conjunction with Aetna Inc's (AET.N) proposed purchase of Humana Inc (HUM.N), which was also announced last summer. Ever since the deals were announced, investors have worried that one or both may not close because of antitrust issues.Anthem has not changed its expectations, Anthem spokeswoman Jill Becher said in a statement.      ""Although our merger agreement with Cigna gives us until April 30, 2017 to obtain regulatory approvals, we continue to believe that we will obtain such approvals and close in the second half of 2016,"" she said.Cigna said in the filing that it continues to target closing in the second half of 2016 but that the closing hinges on regulators' timing and approval.""In light of the complexity of the regulatory process and the dynamic environment, it is possible that such approvals may not be obtained in 2016,"" Cigna said in its first quarter financial filing on Friday. In a February regulatory filing it said that the merger was expected to close in the second half of 2016.  A Cigna spokesman declined to comment beyond the filing. Shares in Cigna, which also reported first quarter earnings on Friday, fell 2 percent to $2.64 in midday trading. Anthem shares fell 0.4 percent to $136.55.

132,"  U.S. health insurer Cigna Corp (CI.N), which is being bought by larger rival Anthem Inc (ANTM.N), reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit as more customers signed up for its Medicare Advantage business, boosting premiums.Memberships in Cigna's government business, which sells Medicare and Medicaid plans, rose 10 percent in the first quarter.This was partially offset by a reduction in Medicare Part D and individual customers, the company said on Friday.Cigna's premium and fees in the global healthcare business, its biggest, rose 4.8 percent to $7.06 billion in the three months ended March 31. The company said shareholder's net income fell to $519 million, or $2 per share, from $533 million, or $2.04 per share.On an adjusted basis, it earned $2.32 per share, beating analysts' estimates of $2.15, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Operating revenue rose 5.6 percent to $9.92 billion, but fell shy of analysts' estimates of $10 billion.Cigna raised its full-year adjusted income from operations forecast to $8.95 to $9.35 per share from $8.85 to $9.25.

134,"   By Bill Berkrot and Caroline Humer | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Cigna Corp signed deals that will pay the makers of two potent but pricey cholesterol-lowering treatments based on how well their customers respond to the medications, the health insurer said on Wednesday.The treatments, Repatha from Amgen Inc and Praluent sold by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc and Sanofi, hit the market last summer with a list price of more than $14,000 per year. They were approved for patients unable to tolerate or who are not able to adequately control ""bad"" LDL cholesterol with statins, such as Lipitor, the most commonly prescribed drugs for cholesterol. Statins typically cost only hundreds of dollars a year.The deals are the highest profile examples to date of insurers basing payments on how well medicines perform for patients. Cigna and Aetna Inc signed deals this year for Entresto, a heart failure drug from Novartis that had slow sales because of its high price.With no price controls on prescription medicines in the United States, as they have in Europe and elsewhere, insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) have become far more aggressive in demanding price discounts and limiting access to expensive new medicines.Under the new agreements, if customers do not reduce LDL to levels seen in clinical trials, the drugmakers will further discount the cost. If the treatments meet or exceed anticipated cholesterol reduction, the negotiated price remains in place, Cigna said.Cigna declined to disclose the prices negotiated, or level of LDL reduction it will use to determine if further discounts are in order. In extensive clinical trials, the drugs reduced LDL by 60 percent or more.Regeneron's head of commercial operations, Robert Terifay, said he expects insurers to increasingly use value analyses to determine payment for chronic conditions, including asthma and heart disease. He said Regeneron had signed deals with other payers to assess the value of Praluent, but declined to identify them. The drugmakers have reported meager sales of Repatha and Praluent, injectable biotech drugs called PCSK9 inhibitors, as insurers have been slow to approve customers seeking the treatments.Amgen last month said some three-quarters of Repatha prescriptions have been denied, and doctors have expressed frustration over the barriers to getting the new medicines to patients. ""We continue to work with payers to help them see the unintended consequences of an onerous system, resulting in patients with high LDL levels not getting access to Repatha,"" Amgen said in a statement. Cigna has a process in place ""that ensures timely access to these very important breakthrough medications for the population that really needs these medications, while ensuring that there isn't a lot of inappropriate or unnecessary utilization,"" Chris Bradbury, senior vice president of Cigna Pharmacy, said in an interview.    Some reimbursement barriers are expected to be removed if large ongoing trials demonstrate that the drugs prevent heart attacks and deaths in addition to dramatically lowering LDL. The first of those results are expected later this year.Aetna said it chose not to engage in a similar performance-based reimbursement arrangement at this time. ""As more cardiovascular outcomes data becomes available, we’ll revisit our options,"" Aetna spokesman T.J. Crawford said. Cigna said it will analyze integrated medical and pharmacy claims data to determine if its customers treated with PCSK9s experience cardiovascular improvements to get a sense of the drugs' benefits outside of the clinical trial setting.It will look for reductions in heart attacks and strokes, for example, Bradbury said.Cigna is seeking to understand the level of medical cost avoidance in order to determine ""a fair market value for the price of the drugs,"" Bradbury said.Amgen shares closed down nearly 2 percent on Wednesday, while Regeneron shares fell 3.6 percent, both on Nasdaq.

National hospitals and doctors groups have spoken out against the deal, saying it would hurt Americans.Zielinski also told investors on Tuesday that he was considering several different ways that he could meet any conditions regulators might set. He did not provide details on those alternatives, but said that there were interested buyers for assets if sales were required.

152,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, May 27 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has maintained the Rating Watch Negative  for Cigna Corporation's (Cigna) 'A-' Issuer Default Rating (IDR), 'BBB+' senior  unsecured notes, and the 'A+' Insurer Financial Strength (IFS) ratings of  certain subsidiaries.  Today's action follows the completion of a periodic review of Cigna's ratings.  Fitch had placed Cigna's ratings on Negative Watch on July 24, 2015 following  the announcement of a definitive agreement to be acquired by Anthem, Inc.  (Anthem). Excluding the ratings-negative aspects of that planned acquisition,  Fitch believes that today's review would have resulted in the affirmation of  Cigna's ratings with Stable Outlooks.   Cigna's Negative Watch status reflects Fitch's expectation that Anthem's  post-acquisition financial leverage metrics will be meaningfully higher and its  interest-coverage ratios will be meaningfully lower than Cigna's have been in  recent years. The Negative Watch status also reflects potential earnings  disruptions that could arise in the short term subsequent to the acquisition's  close as Anthem integrates Cigna from an operational and management perspective. KEY RATING DRIVERS The primary drivers of Cigna's ratings going forward will be financial leverage  and debt service. Anthem is expected to issue an estimated $22 billion of debt  to partially fund its acquisition of Cigna, significantly weakening financial  leverage ratios. Cigna reported a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.3x and a financial  leverage ratio of 30% at March 31, 2016. Fitch estimates that following the  close of the merger, Anthem's consolidated debt-to-EBITDA and financial leverage  ratios will equal 4.0x and 48%, respectively.  Cigna's debt service capabilities and financial flexibility continue to be  strong measured by interest coverage of 16.3x for the full-year 2015 and 17x  through the first three months of 2016. Fitch estimates interest coverage for  the combined Anthem-Cigna to deteriorate to approximately 6x following the  merger. Fitch also expects near-term financial flexibility of Anthem-Cigna to be  somewhat constrained after funding the merger.  Favorably, the combined Anthem-Cigna would be the largest health insurance  company ranked by membership with greater than 50 million medical members. The  combined organization would be expected to benefit from enhanced size and scale  as profit margins are pressured under the Affordable Care Act.  Potential disruption from merger activities has not shown up in Cigna's  operating results, which continue at a level above the company's current  ratings. Specifically, EBITDA margins were strong at 11% for the full- year 2015  and 10.5% in the first quarter of 2016 (1Q16). Similarly, return on capital was  solid at 12.9% for the full year 2015 and 12.1% in 1Q16. RATING SENSITIVITIES Fitch plans to resolve the Negative Rating Watch upon the close of the merger.  If the merger proceeds along the terms announced in the agreement, Fitch expects  to affirm the IFS ratings with a Negative Outlook and downgrade the IDR and  senior debt ratings by one notch to match Anthem's expanded notching. Subsequent to the planned acquisition's close, Cigna's ratings and Rating  Outlook will be most sensitive to Anthem's mid-to-long-term financial leverage  metrics, ability to generate consistent earnings in light of its rapid  membership growth and efforts to integrate Cigna, and benefits from the combined  Cigna-Anthem organization's larger market position and size/scale  characteristics. Fitch would likely remove Cigna's ratings from Negative Rating Watch and affirm  its ratings if the Cigna-Anthem merger failed to close. Fitch has maintained the Negative Rating Watch on the following ratings:  Cigna Corp. --Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'A-'; --Short-term IDR 'F2'; --$1.2 billion commercial paper program 'F2'; --$250 million 5.375% senior notes due March 15, 2017 'BBB+';  --$131 million 6.35% senior notes due March 15, 2018 'BBB+'; --$300 million 5.125% senior notes due June 15, 2020 'BBB+'; --$250 million 4.375% senior notes due Dec. 15, 2020 'BBB+'; --$300 million 4.500% senior notes due March 15, 2021 'BBB+'; --$750 million 4.000% senior notes due Feb. 15, 2022 'BBB+'; --$17 million 8.300% senior notes due Jan. 15, 2023 'BBB+'; --$100 million 7.650% senior notes due March 1, 2023 'BBB+'; --$900 million 3.250% senior notes due April 15, 2025 'BBB+'; --$300 million 7.875% debentures due May 15, 2027 'BBB+'; --$83 million 8.300% senior notes due Jan. 15, 2033 'BBB+'; --$500 million 6.150% senior notes due Nov. 15, 2036 'BBB+'; --$300 million 5.875% senior notes due March 15, 2041 'BBB+'; --$750 million 5.375% senior notes due Feb. 15, 2042 'BBB+'.

""We'll go all the way we need to to make this happen.""Anthem had a more muted response, saying it was committed to working toward a settlement with the Justice Department for its $45 billion transaction, but would challenge the lawsuit if necessary.

170,"   By Caroline Humer and Carl O'Donnell | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Health insurer Aetna Inc (AET.N), whose $33 billion purchase of Humana Inc (HUM.N) has been spurned by the U.S. government, faces a tough but not impossible legal battle to try to reinstate the deal.Aetna vowed to fight “to the very end” after the Department of Justice filed suit earlier on Thursday to block the merger, which had been in the works for more than a year. Antitrust reviewers say the combination will hurt consumers and the companies' proposed fix - selling some health plans to a competitor - is insufficient. The Justice Department simultaneously sued to block Anthem Inc’s (ANTM.N) proposed $45 billion deal for Cigna Inc (CI.N), moving against an unprecedented effort to consolidate the U.S. health insurance market.Of the two deals, analysts and investors see Aetna and Humana as having a slight chance to reverse the decision through a court battle. They face a Justice Department empowered by a series of high-profile successes against mega-mergers, scuttling deals in industries from oil services to retail stores and telecommunications.""My initial impression from the complaint ... is that the Justice Department and the states are on much safer ground"" in their argument against an Aetna-Humana tie-up, said Beau Buffier, co-head of the antitrust group at Shearman & Sterling in New York.The Justice Department lawsuit focused on a county-by-county analysis of where Aetna and Humana have what is deemed too much market share in providing Medicare Advantage for elderly people and in the individual health plans created under President Barack Obama's healthcare reform law. Aetna will argue in court that the Justice Department defined the market for Medicare Advantage too narrowly, which has caused it to see competition issues where they do not exist, Chief Executive Officer Mark Bertolini said in an interview. The government has failed to take into account that seniors can not only choose between Medicare Advantage plans sold by private players, but also have the government-run Medicare program as an option.""Let a judge decide. Is Medicare Advantage competitive with Medicare fee-for-service? If that is indeed the case, then there isn't any market we need to divest,"" Bertolini said. ""If we have to divest, can we provide an appropriate remedy? And we have.""The Justice Department has already rejected that argument. However, Aetna will use evidence that the Obama administration envisioned Medicare and Medicare Advantage as direct competitors as it sought support for the Affordable Care Act passed in 2010. Aetna and Humana also have an answer to the concerns over the Obamacare market, since Humana has already announced plans to cut back dramatically on its presence in that business.""We think over time, that becomes less of an issue,"" Humana CEO Bruce Broussard said in an interview. Humana will in 2017 offer Obamacare plans in only about 160 U.S. counties, compared with 1,351 counties this year. The Justice Department has signaled antitrust concerns in 19 counties.Aetna may also gain some leverage if the Anthem-Cigna deal breaks up first, according to some antitrust experts. In that scenario, Anthem could become a buyer of some Medicare Advantage business they need to divest. “If Cigna-Anthem craters, I wouldn’t be surprised to see the Justice Department agreeing to some kind of divestiture package,” said Matthew Cantor, an antitrust lawyer at Constantine Cannon.Bertolini said Aetna has presented a package of assets to sell that nearly matches up with the 364 counties in 21 states where the Justice Department cites a lack of competition. Aetna has two buyers for those health plans that have experience in Medicare Advantage, he said. A source familiar with the situation said the two companies that have offered to buy all the assets are WellCare Health Plans Inc (WCG.N) and Molina HealthCare Inc (MOH.N).The Justice Department has argued that the proposed buyers are not strong enough players on their own. ""Overall, this will be all about litigating the fix,"" said Andrea Murino, co-chair of Goodwin's antitrust group based in Washington D.C. ""What DOJ wants when they come up with a remedy is an immediate and expansive competitive response - to substitute one company in for another without missing a beat.""

So anything that indicates that would have to be considered a rumor,"" CEO Michael Neidorff said on a post-earnings conference call on Tuesday.Neidorff said Centene's target customers for Medicare Advantage plans were seniors from lower socio-economic background and that businesses from Aetna, Humana and the others served customers who were at a higher level.""That's not our business and we would not build a network for it. So I guess somebody was spreading some rumors,"" he said.Centene's shares fell 13.3 percent to $65.16 despite the company reporting a better-than-expected quarterly profit and increasing its forecast for full-year earnings. Last week, U.S. antitrust officials sued to block the unprecedented consolidation in the national health insurance market, filing a lawsuit against Anthem Inc's proposed purchase of Cigna Corp and Aetna's planned buy of Humana.EARNINGS BEAT  On an adjusted basis, Centene earned $1.29 per share in the second quarter ended June 30, beating the average analyst estimate of $1.09, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.The results were helped by lower medical costs and an increase in Medicare and commercial customers from Centene's acquisition of Health Net.Centene set aside a reserve of $300 million related to Health Net's operations. This reserve did not impact results given the nuances of accounting, but analysts said investors could grow frustrated over Health Net's performance, which has been below expectations so far. The company raised its full-year earnings forecast range to $2.65-$3.00 per share from $2.45-$2.80.Centene's health benefits ratio, or the amount it spends on medical claims compared with its income from premiums, improved to 86.6 percent from 89.1 percent.The ratio, watched closely by investors for increased medical costs and usage, improved largely due to a higher mix of commercial and Medicare patients who have lower expenses.The company's revenue nearly doubled to $10.90 billion.

WEAK QUARTER Cigna slashed its full-year forecast for adjusted income from operations to $7.75-$8.10 per share from $8.95-$9.35, saying it expected medical costs to rise further.  In the second quarter, medical loss ratio - the percent of premiums spent on claims - rose to 78.8 percent in its commercial business from 77.5 percent a year earlier.Like larger rivals UnitedHealth Group Plc (UNH.N) and Anthem, the company was hurt by losses in its individual insurance business, which sells plans under Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare.Cigna said its group disability and life insurance business recorded a loss following modifications to its claims management process implemented earlier in the year. Cigna said shareholders' income fell 13 percent to $510 million, or $1.97 per share, in the quarter ended June 30.Excluding items, the company earned $1.98 per share, well below the average analyst estimate of $2.39, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Total revenue rose nearly 5 percent to $9.96 billion, but missed the average estimate of $9.97 billion.

180,"   By Rishika Sadam  IT services provider Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp (CTSH.O) forecast current-quarter revenue below analysts' estimates, citing the impact of Brexit vote on its clients from the financial services industry.The company, which gets more than a third of its revenue from the financial services sector, said clients were being cautious about their IT spending as they gauge the impact of Britain's vote in June to leave the European Union.""Certainly we see a more a cautious approach in our financial services segment since the UK vote ... more importantly due to the impact it has on the outlook for near term interest rates,"" President Gordon Coburn told Reuters.This week, Wall Street bank Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) said Brexit might hurt some of its operations in the EU and could require restructuring of some of its businesses.JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) Chief Executive Jamie Dimon has also said the event could lead to duplicate costs to provide banking services to European customers. Shares of Cognizant, which gets about 16 percent of its total revenue from Europe, recouped early losses and were up 1.6 percent on the Nasdaq.Coburn said healthcare clients were holding back on spending due to delayed M&A regulatory process in the United States.Big healthcare deals, including Anthem Inc's (ANTM.N) acquisition of Cigna Corp (CI.N) and Aetna Inc's (AET.N) deal to buy Humana Inc (HUM.N), have been delayed as U.S. regulators have sued to block them on antitrust concerns.  Cognizant is betting big on digital services such as cloud and analytics and recently acquired Idea Couture, a digital design firm.The company forecast third-quarter revenue of $3.43 billion to $3.47 billion, below the average analyst estimate of $3.54 billion.Revenue from its business that caters to the financial services industry rose 8.1 percent to $1.35 billion, while healthcare services revenue rose 6.9 percent to $958.8 million in the quarter.

186,"   By Caroline Humer | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Aetna Inc (AET.N) warned in July that it would exit much of the individual Obamacare health insurance market if the government challenged its deal to buy rival Humana Inc (HUM.N), according to a letter it sent to the U.S. Department of Justice.The public release of the letter came after Aetna said on Monday that it would pull out of selling individual insurance on the government-run websites in 11 states, citing financial losses on the business.The company's withdrawal followed similar moves by UnitedHealth Group Inc (UNH.N) and Humana, representing a blow to the marketplace for the government-subsidized insurance plans created under President Barack Obama's signature healthcare reform law.In the July 5 letter, Aetna Chief Executive Officer Mark Bertolini said it would have to cut back because it would be some time before the company recouped the investment it had made in this market over the past 2-1/2 years.""Our ability to withstand these losses is dependent on our achieving anticipated synergies in the Humana acquisition,"" Bertolini wrote. A copy of the letter was posted on the Huffington Post website, which obtained the document though the Freedom of Information Act. ""Unfortunately, a challenge by the DOJ to that acquisition and/or the DOJ successfully blocking the transaction would have a negative financial impact on Aetna and would impair Aetna's ability to continue its support,"" he wrote. Many insurers have said they are losing money because the Obamacare population is sicker than foreseen and the risk-adjustment payments from the government are insufficient. The government has made changes aimed at helping the insurers, which say it has not gone far enough to make the business sustainable.The Justice Department moved on July 21 to block Aetna's acquisition of Humana and Anthem Inc's (ANTM.N) purchase of Cigna Corp (CI.N) after an antitrust review, saying the two deals would lead to higher prices. Aetna spokesman TJ Crawford said the letter was a response to the department's written request for information. The company's ultimate decision was based on financial information obtained after the letter was sent, he said. ""That deterioration, and not the DOJ challenge to our Humana transaction, is ultimately what drove us to announce the narrowing of our public exchange presence for the 2017 plan year,"" Crawford said.The release of the documents is unusual in a Justice Department antitrust investigation. So was the review, which was conducted in tandem with the Anthem-Cigna investigation and involved a business in which the Obama administration was deeply invested.In June, ongoing dialogue between Aetna and the department about the exchanges turned to discussions about the potential impact of a failed deal on those markets, according to a person familiar with the situation.  Assistant Attorney General William Baer, who was leading the review, sent a June 30 request to Aetna for information on the consequences of not completing the deal. A copy of the government document sent to Aetna shows the Justice Department asked for data on costs such as the breakup fee; the impact on Aetna's business strategy, including participation on the Obamacare exchanges; and documents related to a June board meeting, the Humana deal or the exchanges.Aetna shares rose 1 percent to $120.09. Humana fell 0.5 percent to $178.69.

192,"   By Natalie Grover  Health insurer Cigna Corp has discontinued its policy of requiring doctors to seek authorization before treating opioid addicts, as part of a fight against an epidemic of opioid abuse, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said on Friday.The policy change will apply nationally, said Schneiderman, who has been pushing for easier access to treatments for an estimated 2.2 million American addicts.Preauthorization requirements can lead to significant delays in treatment, and other health insurers are encouraged to follow Cigna's lead, Schneiderman said.The abuse of opioids — a class of drugs that include heroin and prescription painkillers — has long been a concern. An overdose can cause euphoric highs and even disrupt parts of the brain that control breathing.Lawmakers across the country are seeking ways to stem the  epidemic, which kills 78 Americans every day. Fewer than half of addicts are receiving help, according to the U.S. Centers for Human and Health Services. The two drugs predominantly used to treat opioid addiction are methadone, which is dispensed only in government-endorsed clinics, and the less-addictive buprenorphine, which exists as a pill, a strip of film, or as part of an implant.These treatments are generally administered along with behavioral therapy and recovery support.Drugmakers including BioDelivery Sciences International Inc, Indivior Plc and privately owned Braeburn Pharmaceuticals have approved buprenorphine treatments for opioid dependency and are developing more. ""Reducing red tape like this is exactly the kind of thinking we need to see from all stakeholders,"" Braeburn CEO Behshad Sheldon told Reuters.  Evidence suggests that the use of these drugs as part of the overall treatment program is more effective than short-term detoxification programs aimed at abstinence, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.Cigna previously required doctors to submit a prior-approval form for medication-assisted treatment (MAT) requests, answering questions about the patient's current treatment and medical history. Waiting for days to obtain medication to treat opioid addiction represents an unnecessary risk for a deadly outcome, said Kelly Clark, president elect of the American Society of Addiction Medicine.Under current law, a doctor can treat a maximum of 275 addicts at a time, and only after obtaining certification and procuring a special Drug Enforcement Administration license.This is done to minimize the risk of illicit drug redistribution, but opponents argue that the approach has left the healthcare system unable to cope with the rising number of addicts.

Evidence suggests that the use of these drugs as part of the overall treatment program is more effective than short-term detoxification programs aimed at abstinence, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.Cigna previously required doctors to submit a prior-approval form for medication-assisted treatment (MAT) requests, answering questions about the patient's current treatment and medical history. Waiting for days to obtain medication to treat opioid addiction represents an unnecessary risk for a deadly outcome, said Kelly Clark, president elect of the American Society of Addiction Medicine.Under current law, a doctor can treat a maximum of 275 addicts at a time, and only after obtaining certification and procuring a special Drug Enforcement Administration license.This is done to minimize the risk of illicit drug redistribution, but opponents argue that the approach has left the healthcare system unable to cope with the rising number of addicts.

194,"  Oct 21 Health insurer Cigna Corp has discontinued its policy of requiring doctors to seek authorization before treating opioid addicts, as part of a fight against an epidemic of opioid abuse, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said on Friday.The policy change will apply nationally, said Schneiderman, who has been pushing for easier access to treatments for the estimated 2.2 million Americans who need treatment for abuse of heroin or prescription painkillers.Preauthorization requirements can lead to significant delays in treatment, and other health insurers are encouraged to follow Cigna's lead, Schneiderman said in a statement. Lawmakers around the country are seeking ways to stem the  epidemic, which kills 78 Americans every day. Fewer than half of addicts are receiving help, according to the U.S. Centers for Human and Health Services.
