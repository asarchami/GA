5,"  * S&P/Case-Shiller home price index up 0.8 pct in December* Conference board says consumer confidence slipped in February* Toll Brothers', Home Depot's results cloud housing outlookBy Rodrigo CamposFeb 25 U.S. home price gains slowed in December, according to a closely watched housing survey on Tuesday that underscored a loss of momentum in the housing recovery, while consumer confidence drifted lower this month.The S&P/Case-Shiller 20-city home price index rose a seasonally adjusted 0.8 percent in December, down from a 0.9 percent rise in November. For the 12 months to December, prices were up 13.4 percent, below the peak of 13.7 percent in November and the first decline in the rate of change since June. ""Recent housing data has shown that activity at the outset of 2014 has slowed down,"" said Jefferies economists in a note regarding the Case-Shiller gauge.""It is possible that the index has reached a near-term top.""Recent data have shown the housing recovery losing steam in the early part of the year. Housing starts dropped 16 percent in January, the biggest decline in almost three years, and home resales slid to a 1-1/2 year low last month. Bitter cold and serial snowstorms this winter have been blamed in part for the weakness in the housing sector, though analysts say higher mortgage rates and low inventories have hurt as well.On Tuesday, Toll Brothers, the largest U.S. luxury homebuilder, reported a fall in quarterly orders for the first time in three years as a severe winter deterred buyers. Home Depot's higher-than-expected profit came in as cost cuts offset weak sales.A Reuters poll showed U.S. home price inflation, as measured by the S&P/Case-Shiller index, is seen slowing to less than 7 percent this year as mortgage rates rise and there is a gradual transition away from a market driven by institutional buyers looking for bargains. A sentiment survey on Tuesday suggested consumers were wary of future economic conditions.Consumer confidence slipped in February, according to a private sector report. The Conference Board, an industry group, said its index of consumer attitudes fell to 78.1 from a downwardly revised 79.4 in January. Economists in a Reuters poll had expected 80.0.""While expectations have fluctuated over recent months, current conditions have continued to trend upward,"" Lynn Franco, director of economic indicators at The Conference Board, said in a statement.""This suggests that consumers believe the economy has improved, but they do not foresee it gaining considerable momentum in the months ahead.""",2014-02-25,HD,"Tue Feb 25, 2014 | 1:27pm EST","WRAPUP 1-U.S. home price rise momentum weakens, consumer confidence falls",http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-economy-idUSL1N0LU1F220140225?type=companyNews

The comments will be scoured for insight into the extent to which bad weather has affected economic activity, as well as for confirmation that the Fed will not make any changes to its schedule for trimming stimulus.* S&P 500 futures fell 3.3 points and were below fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures lost 30 points and Nasdaq 100 futures slid 5 points. * Tenet Healthcare Corp late Monday swung to a net loss in its fourth quarter, though adjusted earnings were better than expected.* Biocryst Pharmaceuticals Inc rose 3.3 percent to $11.99 in light premarket trading after the company said the Food and Drug Administration had accepted the New Drug Application for its Peramivir product.* Sina Corp shares fell in premarket trading a day after the company reported adjusted earnings that beat estimates by a penny, even as revenue jumped 43 percent.* SolarCity Corp, the largest residential solar installer in the United States, said it expects to install fewer panels in a seasonally weak first quarter due to cold weather.* Perry Ellis International Inc late Monday forecast a fall in quarterly revenue, sending shares sharply lower after the market closed.",2014-02-25,HD,"Tue Feb 25, 2014 | 7:20am EST",US STOCKS-Futures slip; results lift Home Depot in premarket,http://www.reuters.com//article/markets-usa-stocks-idUSL1N0LU0RP20140225?type=companyNews

25,"   By David Beasley | ATLANTA  ATLANTA A suburban Atlanta man jailed on charges he murdered his 22-month-old son by intentionally leaving the child strapped in an overheated car to die has been fired from his job at Home Depot Inc, the company said Thursday.A spokeswoman for the Atlanta-based home improvement chain confirmed that Justin Ross Harris, 33, of Marietta, Georgia, had been terminated from the company, which had employed him as a computer specialist.But the spokeswoman, Catherine Woodling, declined to give a reason for the company's action.“We don't discuss the details of individual personnel matters,” Woodling said. At a preliminary court hearing last week, a police detective testified that Harris was exchanging nude pictures over the Internet with women other than his wife while his son, Cooper, was strapped in a car seat on June 18 in the Home Depot parking lot, dying from the heat.Harris told police he forgot to drop Cooper off at the daycare center on his way to work and only discovered the child after he left the office that afternoon and was driving to a movie theater.Prosecutors, however, said Harris deliberately left Cooper in the car to perish because he wanted to live a “child free life.” A judge ordered Harris to remain jailed without bond, ruling there was probable cause for felony murder and child cruelty charges against him. Harris’ wife, Leanna, has not been charged in the case, but Atlanta attorney Lawrence Zimmerman confirmed to Reuters Thursday that he has been retained to represent her. Zimmerman declined further comment.Cobb County police spokesman Michael Bowman would neither confirm or deny on Thursday that Leanna Harris is a suspect. “She has been interviewed, and this case is still active and fluid,” Bowman said.Authorities said Cooper Harris died of heat stroke. Results of toxicology tests on the child were normal, police said Thursday.

29,"   By Sruthi Ramakrishnan  Home Depot Inc said it expected same-store sales to grow faster in the second half of the year as customers renovate homes with big-ticket purchases such as wood and laminate flooring in a recovering U.S. housing market.Shares of the world's largest home improvement chain rose as much as 6.5 percent to an all-time high of $88.99, adding more than $7 billion to the company's market value after it also reported better-than-expected quarterly results. An improving U.S. jobs market is encouraging people to undertake larger home remodeling projects, David Crowe, chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders, said in July. (bit.ly/1w5iXUB)People also spent more on repairing winter-related damage to their houses, helping Home Depot recover most of sales it lost in the first quarter, Wedbush Securities analyst Seth Basham wrote in a note on Tuesday.Home Depot expects same-store sales growth in the second half to be 80 basis points higher than the first half, Chief Financial Officer Carol Tome said on a conference call. The company, however, maintained its full-year sales growth forecast of about 4.8 percent, which Canaccord Genuity analyst Laura Champine called ""somewhat conservative.""She said Home Depot was expected to gain market share on the strength of its product assortment and in-store execution. The company controlled 19.2 percent of the U.S. home improvement market in 2013, up from 17 percent in 2006, according to Euromonitor International. In the period, smaller rival Lowe's Cos Inc's share grew to 15.6 percent from 12 percent.Lowe's, the world's second-largest home improvement company, is scheduled to report results on Wednesday.  Lowe's shares rose 3 percent to $51.98 on Tuesday. Tome said there was a ""nice recovery"" in demand from building contractors as ""customers clearly feel better about investing in their homes."" Home Depot gets much of its business from building contractors. Purchases of over $900 rose 8.4 percent in the second quarter ended Aug. 3, driven by sales of appliances, windows, water heaters, wood and laminate flooring.

Blake will stay on as chairman, the company said in a statement.Menear, 56, joined Home Depot in 1997 as a merchandising manager. He held various management positions before being named senior vice president of merchandising in 2003, according to the company's website.The move comes as Home Depot tries to steer through a slow recovery in the U.S. housing market, where rising interest rates and low wage growth have stifled spending on new homes.The company, on Tuesday, maintained its full-year sales growth forecast but offered a positive outlook for the rest of the year. Home Depot said it expected same-store sales to grow faster in the second half of the year as homeowners spend more on repairing and remodeling their homes after a severe winter season.Menear's move will be effective on Nov. 1, the company said. Before joining Home Depot, Menear worked at furniture companies Ikea [IKEA.UL], Builders Emporium, Grace Home Centers and Montgomery Ward.Blake, who led Home Depot through the financial recession, drove sales at the world's largest home improvement retailer from $66 billion in 2010 to $78 billion in 2013 - levels last seen before the recession. The company's stock more than doubled during his six years at the helm.Home Depot shares were little changed in extended trading after closing at $91.15 on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday.

52,"  Home Depot Inc (HD.N) is being tight-lipped about its possible credit card breach, the opposite approach to the one Target Corp (TGT.N) took nearly a year ago.Almost a week after security blogger Brian Krebs warned that Home Depot could be the victim of a breach extending to more than 2,000 U.S. stores, the home improvement chain has not confirmed or denied that one had occurred. The company said Tuesday that it was working with authorities to investigate the matter.By contrast, Target made initial disclosures on its breach's scope but later revised them in a series of updates that confused and angered consumers, hitting sales and contributing to Chief Executive Officer Gregg Steinhafel's departure. In its minimalist communication strategy, Home Depot likely is drawing lessons from Target, avoiding an incremental approach that risks giving the impression that it does not have a complete grasp of the problem, crisis management experts said.""When you have criminal behavior, you don’t know right away what all the ramifications are,"" said Davia Temin, head of a consultancy focused on crisis and reputation management. ""It’s really hard when you are trying to overcommunicate not to misstate reality."" Target in December used its first disclosure to say 40 million credit and debit cards might have been compromised. A week later it said encrypted PIN data had been stolen. And in January, it said data on up to 70 million people might have been taken.Target spokeswoman Molly Snyder said the company had moved quickly to inform customers as facts were uncovered during a complex investigation. To be sure, the situations facing Target and Home Depot are not exactly the same. While Target knew it was dealing with data theft, Home Depot has held on to the possibility that no breach has occurred.  ""When you are in a situation like this you have a choice,"" Home Depot CEO Frank Blake said at an investor conference on Thursday. ""On the one hand, you can wait to communicate anything until you have the facts at hand, or you can communicate the facts as you know them.

53,"  Sept 8 Home Depot Inc is being tight-lipped about its possible credit card breach, the opposite approach to the one Target Corp took nearly a year ago.Almost a week after security blogger Brian Krebs warned that Home Depot could be the victim of a breach extending to more than 2,000 U.S. stores, the home improvement chain has not confirmed or denied that one had occurred. The company said Tuesday that it was working with authorities to investigate the matter.By contrast, Target made initial disclosures on its breach's scope but later revised them in a series of updates that confused and angered consumers, hitting sales and contributing to Chief Executive Officer Gregg Steinhafel's departure.In its minimalist communication strategy, Home Depot likely is drawing lessons from Target, avoiding an incremental approach that risks giving the impression that it does not have a complete grasp of the problem, crisis management experts said.""When you have criminal behavior, you don't know right away what all the ramifications are,"" said Davia Temin, head of a consultancy focused on crisis and reputation management. ""It's really hard when you are trying to overcommunicate not to misstate reality."" Target in December used its first disclosure to say 40 million credit and debit cards might have been compromised. A week later it said encrypted PIN data had been stolen. And in January, it said data on up to 70 million people might have been taken.Target spokeswoman Molly Snyder said the company had moved quickly to inform customers as facts were uncovered during a complex investigation. To be sure, the situations facing Target and Home Depot are not exactly the same. While Target knew it was dealing with data theft, Home Depot has held on to the possibility that no breach has occurred.""When you are in a situation like this you have a choice,"" Home Depot CEO Frank Blake said at an investor conference on Thursday. ""On the one hand, you can wait to communicate anything until you have the facts at hand, or you can communicate the facts as you know them. We chose the latter path.""

Most of these expenses were for settling actual and potential breach-related claims, mainly by payment card networks.

65,"   By Suzanne Barlyn | Sept 10  Sept 10 Cyber security breaches are rare among investment advisory firms registered with U.S. states, but improvements to technology and procedures could still bolster protection of client information, state securities regulators said on Wednesday.Just 4 percent of advisers reported having a ""cyber security incident"" during the years in which they have been registered in their respective states, according to a study by the North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA). The incidents were as diverse as website breaches and hackers impersonating clients via email.Theft and unauthorized use of confidential data were problems for 1 percent of advisers, NASAA said. The study did find problems, however. For example, nearly a third of advisers that contact clients via email do not send messages through a secure system that prevents them from being read by hackers and other third parties. Also, fewer than half of the firms surveyed, or 44 percent, had policies, procedures and training in place related to cyber security. State-registered investment advisers account for more than half of the registered investment advisers in the United States, NASAA said. The group released the cyber-security study on Wednesday at its annual conference in Indianapolis.Financial services firms have been jittery about information security after several high-profile data breaches at major retailers, including Target Corp and Home Depot Inc.  JPMorgan Chase & Co is also investigating a possible cyber attack, a spokeswoman said on Aug. 29. NASAA's study included 440 state-registered investment advisory firms in nine states. U.S. state securities regulators oversee small and mid-sized investment advisers who manage up to $100 million. Larger investment advisers register with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.Other states are now using NASAA's pilot study to collect information from advisers in their jurisdictions. NASAA plans to develop guidance for advisers about cyber security practices based on the results, Valerie Mirko, NASAA deputy general counsel, said in a telephone interview. NASAA expects the additional results by yearend, Mirko said.

The news also caught the attention of credit ratings agency Moody's, which said the attack is a ""negative"" factor, though there was no immediate rating impact.The effort by five U.S. states was disclosed just a day after the largest U.S. home improvement retailer confirmed it had been breached.A spokeswoman for Connecticut Attorney General George Jepsen said that California, Connecticut and Illinois would lead the multistate effort. New York and Iowa said they would also participate. ""We have had initial contact with the company,"" said Jaclyn Falkowski, director of communications for Jepsen.Meanwhile, U.S. senators Edward Markey of Massachusetts and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut called on the Federal Trade Commission to investigate.""If Home Depot failed to adequately protect customer information, it denied customers the protection that they rightly expect when a business collects such information,"" the senators said in a statement. ""Such conduct is potentially unfair and deceptive, and therefore could violate the FTC Act.""An FTC spokesman declined comment. The agency investigates breaches but tends to focus on cyberattacks that are partially the result of poor security on the part of the victim.Home Depot spokeswoman Paula Drake said in response to the possible FTC probe that the company will continue to cooperate with lawmakers and others. She declined to comment on the multistate investigation.The retailer said on its website that banks and law enforcement warned of unusual activity related to its payment systems on Sept. 2, prompting it to hire security experts who confirmed it had been breached.When asked if investigators had confirmed the attackers had been removed from the company's network, Drake declined to comment.The company has advised customers to examine statements carefully for unusual charges, saying they will not be held responsible for fraudulent activity. It has arranged for free credit monitoring.Home Depot shares fell 2.1 percent to $88.93 on Tuesday, wider than the 0.7 percent decline in the S&P 500 Index    (Additional reporting and writing by Nandita Bose in Chicago, with Jim Finkle in Boston and Diane Bartz in Washington; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama, Matthew Lewis and Lisa Shumaker)",2014-09-10,HD,"Tue Sep 9, 2014 | 8:35pm EDT","UPDATE 3-U.S. states probe Home Depot breach, senators seek FTC investigation",http://www.reuters.com//article/home-depot-dataprotection-breach-probe-idUSL1N0RA1DL20140910?type=companyNews
68,"  (Adds detail on card security breaches, byline)By David HenryNEW YORK, Sept 17 JPMorgan Chase & Co is replacing some credit and debit cards following the security breach at Home Depot Inc, a company spokesman said.The company began sending notices on Tuesday to some card holders, advising them that they will soon receive new cards because the breach put them ""at risk.""One of the notices said the company would mail a new card on Sept. 30. The existing card can be used in the meantime, but the notice advised monitoring the account for unrecognized purchases.JPMorgan spokesman Paul Hartwick could not immediately say how many cards are likely to be replaced. Home Depot disclosed on Sept. 8 that its payment security systems had been breached. The company is investigating how much account data might have been taken as customers paid for purchases in the United States and Canada from April through August.The spokesman could not immediately say why the bank moved now to replace the cards or discuss how it balanced the goals of thwarting fraud and minimizing inconvenience to customers.After card data was taken from Target Corp stores in December, JPMorgan quickly canceled some debit cards that were threatened and asked customers to go to branches for replacements. JPMorgan is the biggest U.S. bank by assets and one of the biggest card issuers. It issues cards under its Chase brand and under co-branding relationships with some airlines and hotel chains, such as United, Southwest and Marriott.The notice to card holders said customers will not be liable for unauthorized transactions that they report promptly to the company. The company said it would continue to monitor accounts to help identify unusual activity. After confirming the breach, Home Depot promised free identity-protection services, including credit monitoring, to any potentially affected customers.The retailer had said earlier it will roll out PIN- and chip-enabled cards at all its U.S. stores by the end of the year to prevent card fraud.Brian Krebs, who runs the security website KrebsOnSecurity and first reported the Home Depot breach, said earlier this month that it could be larger than the attack on Target in which hackers stole at least 40 million payment card numbers and 70 million other pieces of customer data during that retailer's busiest season.Target has spent $146 million to resolve data breach-related issues since the fourth quarter of 2013. Most of the expenses were for settling actual and potential breach-related claims, mainly by payment card networks.The largest known breach at a U.S. retailer was uncovered in 2007 at TJX Cos Inc TJX.N, operator of the T.J. Maxx and Marshalls chains, which had more than 90 million credit cards stolen over about 18 months.

Home Depot, in providing the first clues to how much the breach would cost, said that so far it has estimated costs of $62 million. But it indicated that costs could reach much higher.It will take months to determine the full scope of the fraud, which affected Home Depot stores in both the United States and Canada and ran from April to September.Retailer Target incurred costs of $148 million in its second fiscal quarter related to its breach. Target hackers stole at least 40 million payment card numbers and 70 million other pieces of customer data.Home Depot said that criminals used unique, custom-built software that had not been seen in previous attacks and was designed to evade detection in its most complete account of what had happened since it first disclosed the breach on Sept. 8. The company said that the hackers’ method of entry has been closed off, the malware eliminated from its network, and that it had rolled out ""enhanced encryption of payment data"" to all U.S. stores.""We apologize to our customers for the inconvenience and anxiety this has caused and want to reassure them that they will not be liable for fraudulent charges,"" Chief Executive Frank Blake said in a statement. Of the estimated cost so far of $62 million, which covers such items as credit monitoring, increased call center staffing, and legal and professional services, Home Depot said it believes that $27 million of the amount will be paid for by insurers.But the company said it has not yet estimated the impact of ""probable losses"" related to the possible need to reimburse banks for fraud and card replacement, as well as covering costs of lawsuits and government investigations.""Those costs may have a material adverse effect on The Home Depot’s financial results in the fourth quarter and/or future periods,"" the company said in its statement. Wesley McGrew, an expert of retail breaches who is an assistant research professor at the department of computer science at Mississippi State University, said that Home Depot is going to be expected to bear the costs related to fraud and payment card replacement.  Banks typically seek to get retailers to cover those costs if there are any indications of shortcomings in their security.Criminals have frequently used software that evades detection, but retailers are expected to closely monitor their networks using tools that are designed to uncover signs of a crime in progress, McGrew said. ""It’s hard to feel sorry for them when there are things they could have done to improve the security of these transactions,"" McGrew said.  Hitesh Sheth, chief executive of Vectra Networks, a cybersecurity firm in San Jose, California, said Home Depot's breach exposes a weakness, noting that the company said hackers used unique, custom-built malware.That ""essentially means the technology they are using is only designed to detect malware that has already been used in a previous attack, and that is symptomatic of the retail industry,” Sheth said.“Retailers need to upgrade to technology that is available and detects behavior of malware that is new because these attacks are not going to stop anytime soon.”For its fiscal year ending in February, Home Depot revised its earnings estimate to $4.54 per share from $4.52.

Penney's shares rose as much as 5.3 percent to $7.50 in early trading as the company ended a year-long search for a replacement for interim CEO Myron Ullman.Ellison, who will take over as CEO on Aug. 1, 2015, held a variety of roles at Target Corp over 15 years before joining Home Depot Inc in 2002.

Ullman, who was J.C. Penney's CEO from 2004 to 2011, was brought back by J.C.

Its parent company, struggling retailer Sears Holdings Corp, recently cut its stake in the Canadian chain to 12 percent from 51 percent.   JA Solar Holdings Co Ltd, the Chinese solar panel maker is expected to post a quarterly profit versus a year-ago loss, helped by strong demand from new markets such as the Middle East, Africa and Latin America. The company's third-quarter revenue is expected to jump 48 percent. JA Solar had earlier said it plans to set up factories in North America to bypass U.S. duties on solar panels made in China.

88,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, December 05 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has upgraded its long-term Issuer  Default Rating (IDR) on The Home Depot, Inc. to 'A' from 'A-', and its  short-term IDR to 'F1' from 'F2'.  The Rating Outlook is Stable. Home Depot had  $16.7 billion of debt outstanding as of Nov. 2, 2014. A full rating list is  shown below.   Key Rating Drivers The upgrade reflects the strong improvement in Home Depot's comparable store  sales (comps), operating margins and free cash flow (FCF) over the past five  years, and Fitch's expectation that the company will be able to sustain this  performance going forward. Compared with its nearest competitor, Home Depot has  generated superior operating margins (400 basis-point gap) and consistently  stronger comps over the past five years. The ratings further consider Home Depot's leading position in the home  improvement retail sector in North America and steady adjusted debt/EBITDAR at  or under 2x. In addition, the ratings consider the cyclical nature of home  improvement retailing and the challenges posed by a slow economic recovery.  Home Depot is the world's largest home improvement retailer with a 25% market  share in the $312 billion U.S. home improvement market using the U.S. Census  Bureau's NAICS codes. Lowe's has a 17% share, and Menards has sizable presence  in the Midwest. Defining the market more broadly to include wholesalers, mass  merchants, and online sellers suggests that Home Depot and Lowe's have a  combined 20% of the market. Home Depot has been able to generate strong operating momentum in the midst of a  home improvement industry that has seen consumers focus on repair and  maintenance projects. Home Depot's comparable store sales (comps) have been positive since 2010.  Faster growth of seasonal and big ticket items helped to drive healthy 4.6% comp  growth in the first nine months of 2014. Comp sales are expected to grow at  3%-5% over the next two years, supported by a continued recovery in the housing  market and the company's investments in its multi-channel activities. Online  sales represented 4.4% of Home Depot's total sales in the third quarter of 2014,  but grew almost 40% in the quarter and the nine months, adding 1.7% to top-line  growth.   There has been no discernible impact on sales from Home Depot's September 2014  announcement of a data breach in which 56 million credit card numbers and 53  million emails were stolen. Fitch believes that the ultimate cash costs from  this breach to cover fraud reimbursement and credit card reissuance, among other  things, can be covered by FCF, although it would reduce the amount available for  share repurchases. Home Depot has produced a strong margin recovery on expense leverage, with EBIT  margins improving to 12.6% in the 12 months ending Nov. 2, 2014, from 11.9% in  2013 and 10.9% in 2012. The company targets a 13% operating margin and a 27%  ROIC by 2015 (from 11.9% and 20.9%, respectively, in 2013). Fitch believes this  is achievable, and sees moderate margin upside longer-term from fixed expense  leverage and the investments the company is making in technology and its supply  chain.  Home Depot is maintaining a very slow pace of new-store expansion, with plans to  build only six new stores in 2014, focused primarily in Mexico. Low levels of  capital expenditures (less than 2% of sales) have resulted in strong FCF after  dividends, which is expected to track around $4 billion annually going forward.  Fitch expects Home Depot would remain FCF positive in an economic downturn, as  it did through the last recession.  Financial leverage (adjusted debt/EBITDAR) was 1.8x as of November 2014, in-line  with year-end 2013. Fitch expects FCF and some incremental borrowings to be  directed to share repurchases, as the company manages its financial leverage at  or under 2x. Home Depot has a solid liquidity position supported by a cash balance of $2.2  billion at Nov. 2, 2014, together with an undrawn $2 billion credit facility.  The company also benefits from owning 90% of its stores.  Rating Sensitivities  Weaker operating trends or a move by management to more shareholder-friendly  policies that cause adjusted leverage to increase to the low 2x range on a  sustained basis could lead to a negative rating action.  Continued positive operating trends together with a sustained reduction in  adjusted leverage to below 1.5x could lead to a positive rating action.  Fitch has upgraded Home Depot as follows: --Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to 'A' from 'A-';  --Senior unsecured notes to 'A' from 'A-'; --Bank credit facilities to 'A' from 'A-'; --Short-term IDR to 'F1' from 'F2'; --Commercial paper to 'F1' from 'F2'.

He discussed the legislation on Tuesday with House Speaker John Boehner and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and said they agreed cybersecurity needs to be addressed.

And it would make selling stolen credit card information overseas a crime and would allow authorities to prosecute the sale of botnets, computer networks linked to cybercrime.He also wants to require companies to tell consumers within 30 days from the discovery of a data breach that their personal information has been compromised.

92,"   By Nandita Bose | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Results from Home Depot Inc (HD.N) and Toll Brothers Inc (TOL.N) bode well for a continued recovery in the housing market this year, thanks largely to an improving jobs market and low gasoline prices, industry officials and analysts said. On Tuesday, the world's largest home-improvement chain, Home Depot, posted its strongest-ever fourth quarter in terms of sales growth, driven by demand for home renovations. Luxury home builder Toll Brothers also lifted its full-year home delivery forecast. Shares of both companies rose nearly 4 percent.The pickup in home renovations, reflected by demand for paint, flooring and appliances, can be explained in part by the improved financial position of many households over the past three months due to lower gasoline prices, said Neil Saunders, chief executive of retail research firm Conlumino.The improved picture for many U.S. households is supported by data that measures consumer spending on new homes and home improvement, he said. Private residential fixed investment topped $577 billion in the fourth quarter of last year, the highest amount since the fourth quarter of 2007 when it stood at $616.4 billion. This comes even though total homes sold decreased in 2014,  Saunders said.He cautioned, however, that the sudden spurt in renovations could be short-lived if gasoline prices continue to inch up. Prices have risen every day for the past 28 days to an average of $2.30 for a gallon, up from a low of $2.03 last month.U.S. home prices also rose in December and experts said sales and prices of existing homes remained close to normal but construction of new home sales remain weak. But analysts said overall housing demand would continue to show an uptick, helped by growth in the number of jobs, higher wages and the recent federal initiatives to increase mortgage availability.For example, Toll Brothers is finding it easier to raise prices of its homes now and said there are more buyers in its key markets including Arizona, Colorado, Nevada and Washington. Another sign is the monthly principal and interest payments for single-family homes as a percentage of disposable income. It stood at 23 percent in December, much lower than the average of 35 percent since 1990, said RBC Capital Markets analyst Robert Wetenhall.Wetenhall expects wage inflation in the second half of 2015 to more than offset higher interest rates and a low single-digit price appreciation in home prices. This he said adds to both affordability and the broader outlook for housing demand this year.

104,"   By Nandita Bose | CHICAGO, March 30  CHICAGO, March 30 Amazon.com Inc is launching a home services marketplace that will connect customers with electricians, plumbers and painters in a move to have its services tied to every product sold on its website.Amazon Home Services, which will launch on Monday, will allow customers to buy 700 services such as car maintenance, TV wall-mounting and house cleaning at upfront prices. The quality of the service will be backed with an Amazon guarantee, which the retailer uses to vouch for products sold by third-party sellers on its website.A home services marketplace will extend Amazon's role as a middleman for third-party vendors, which account for about 40 percent of its sales. It would also help Amazon gain an edge in the fast-growing services industry in the U.S. which the retailer estimates to be around $630 billion. ""Third party estimates show that customers spend four times more on services each year than they do on physical products,"" Peter Faricy, vice-president, Amazon Marketplace told Reuters.""So for us the opportunity is very big,"" he said. Around 85 million Amazon shoppers buy products that require servicing or installation, the company said. Amazon will roll out the service nationwide with ""high coverage"" in Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles and New York.Services marks a new frontier for Amazon, which has focused on selling products as it expanded from books into consumer goods, groceries and media. Local services have been tough for marketplace companies to turn a profit, since offerings must be tailored to each city or region. Amazon will be in direct competition with Angie's List Inc , Craigslist Inc, and Yelp Inc as well as U.S. home improvement chains like Home Depot Inc and Lowe's Companies Inc, which have invested in ways to link customers with local plumbers, painters and other service providers.Amazon will hand pick service professionals after running background checks and offer to match prices if customers get a lower price for the same service and professional on another site, store or directly from the professional within 30 days of a purchase, Faricy said.Amazon Home Services will have a revenue share model with the service providers. The retailer will charge a 5 percent transaction fee, along with platform fees ranging from 10 percent for custom services and 15 percent for standardized services.

WEEK AHEAD      The stragglers for the earnings season - Home Depot, Wal-Mart and a few others - will report results to close out the quarter next week, with expectations that retailers would see decent sales after recent revisions show better-than-expected activity in the second quarter. The markets will also continue to watch the Chinese yuan after its unexpected devaluation this week, with anticipation that the dollar will strengthen a bit more, boosting bond-market activity in what is otherwise expected to be a slower week.      Fed minutes are released on Wednesday and will be parsed for clues of an interest rate rise. The Changes in the July statement pointed to an improving economy and labor markets. Characterization of the debate in the minutes could indicate how firm opinions are about the state of the U.S., and how confident members are that inflation and employment will move towards the Fed's target levels. Investors will also look for the Labor Department's Consumer Price Index on Wednesday, which is expected to have increased 0.2 percent in July, a bit down from a rise of 0.3 percent in June. Housing data, including housing starts and building permits on Tuesday and existing home sales on Thursday will be in focus. The Conference Board releases its Leading Economic Index, a gauge of future U.S. economic activity on Thursday.      Retailer Wal-Mart Stores Inc and Target Corp release its results for the second quarter. Wal-Mart is expected to report better-than-expected quarterly sales on Tuesday, while Target is expected to miss estimates when it reports on Wednesday. Also on Tuesday, TJX Cos Inc is expected to report second-quarter profit and sales above analysts' average estimates. The off-price retailer is expected to be helped by lower gas prices, wage growth, and higher traffic to its stores as more consumers hunt for bargains. A hike in the number and quality of brands in its stores and merchandise that reflects popular fashion trends is also expected to drive sales. Investors will look for third-quarter forecast, commentary on industry trends and plans to expand in international markets.      Home Depot Inc, the world's No. 1 home improvement chain, is likely to report second-quarter sales below analysts' average estimate on Tuesday. Strong housing market data over the last few months is expected to have kept overall demand for home improvement goods steady. However, record rainfall in May and June in large parts of the United States is likely to have kept a lid on sales of products in the home exterior improvement categories, such as paint and gardening supplies. Lowe's Companies Inc, the second-largest U.S. home improvement chain, is likely to report second-quarter sales below analysts' average estimates on Wednesday.      Hardware and software maker Hewlett-Packard Co is expected to report third-quarter earnings slightly above analysts' average estimate on Thursday. HP has been cutting costs and focusing on higher-margin sales in the face of a strong dollar and weak enterprise demand for its services. The company is also in the processes of separating its computer and printer businesses from its faster-growing corporate hardware and service operations.      Salesforce.com Inc, the world's biggest maker of online sales software, is expected to report a second-quarter profit above analysts' average estimate. Salesforce has struggled to earn consistent profits despite strong revenue growth over the past few years, hurt by higher spending on hiring. The company reported a profit for the first time in seven quarters in May. On Thursday, the investors will look for improvement in margins in the quarter and merger-related comments.      Data storage equipment maker NetApp Inc is expected to report first-quarter revenue on Wednesday slightly above average analysts' estimate. NetApp, which cut about 500 jobs in May, has been trying to boost growth by focusing on cloud-based products as businesses cut spending on high-end storage systems. The company appointed George Kurian as its new CEO in June to replace Tom Georgens. Investors would be looking for second-quarter forecast.      On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis President Narayana Kocherlakota speaks before the ""Macroeconomic Policy and Price Measurement Issues in a Low Inflation Environment"" conference, in Seoul, South Korea. On Thursday, the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco releases the text of the speech Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco President John Williams delivered before the Bank Indonesia-BIS Research Conference in Jakarta, Indonesia.      Apparel retailer Gap Inc is expected to report a second-quarter profit below analysts' estimates on Thursday. Out of fashion merchandise and a general lack of trendy products have led to a decline in sales at the company's flagship Gap brand, leading to heavy discounts. Shipment delays caused due to disruptions at the West Coast ports early this year and a strong dollar are also expected to hurt the company's results in the quarter. Investors will look for comments on recovery at the Gap brand and performance in the current quarter.      On Wednesday, teen apparel retailer American Eagle Outfitters Inc is expected to report second-quarter profit and sales above analysts' average estimates. The earnings beat is expected to be driven by trendy, fashionable merchandise, lower discounts, benefits from lower cotton prices and tight inventory controls. American Eagle is also benefiting from a new multi-channel distribution center that allows it to control inventories more efficiently by enabling it to supply to its brick-and-mortar as well as online stores. Investors will look for third-quarter forecast, commentary on promotions and trends, and expectations for the back-to-school shopping season.      Agriculture equipment maker Deere & Co has been hurt by a strong dollar as well as weak demand for its farm and turf equipment, which make up about two-thirds of its annual revenue. Falling U.S. farm income and weak commodity prices have reduced spending on new equipment by farmers. In May, Deere forecast a fall in global sales for its farm equipment in 2015 and said it would close plants and cut jobs. When the company reports its third-quarter results on Friday, the investors will be looking for an update on the company's plans to shutter more factories to adjust to lower demand, as well as whether it is expected to take a hefty charge on a tractor recall announced earlier in August. They will also be looking for more information on a fire in a chemical warehouse in China last week that left some Deere workers critically injured.      Friday data is expected to show that Canada's June retail sales have increased a little, compared with the previous month's reading. It is likely to have risen 0.2 percent, compared with a rise of 1.0 percent in May. Canada's inflation data is also out on Friday. Country's annual inflation is likely to have advanced 1.4 percent in July, up from 1.0 percent in June. Statistics Canada releases June wholesale trade data on Thursday.      On Thursday, Mexico's statistics institute will release GDP data for the second quarter, after the central bank said it sees quarter-on-quarter growth of 0.3 percent for the period, slackening from the first quarter after weaker-than-expected exports and a slump in domestic oil output. The same day, data with show how economic activity fared in June, after slowing to a nine-month low in May. On Friday, retail sales data for June will show how domestic spending performed after rebounding by 0.2 percent in May.           MONDAY, AUGUST 17      U.S. homebuilder sentiment is expected to stay strong in August as the National Association of Home Builders's NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market index is likely to show an increase to 61 from 60 in July, which was the highest since November 2005. (1000/1400) Also, the New York Federal Reserve releases its New York Fed's Empire State general business conditions index for August. (0830/1230)      Beauty products company Estee Lauder Co Inc has been seeing a revival in sales in North America, helped by product launches and acquisitions. However, Estee has to increase promotions in its flagship Clinique and Estee Lauder brands which have shown some weakness. The company's smaller brands such as Smashbox and Bobbi Brown have seen a rise in demand, helped by their extensive online presence. Even as sales in overseas markets like the UK and China grow by double digit percentages, a stronger dollar in the past few quarters has stripped their value. The company is expected to beat revenue and profit estimates for the fourth quarter. Investors will be keen on 2016 forecast, updates on acquisitions and the impact of the dollar.      Apparel retailer Urban Outfitters Inc is expected to report second-quarter profit and sales slightly above analysts' average estimates. The beat is expected to be driven by strong performance at the flagship Urban Outfitters brand, which accounts for a majority of sales, but margins are expected to be pressured by higher promotions at the Anthropologie brand, where sales growth has slowed in recent quarters. The company is also benefiting from investments in its fast-growing e-commerce and online division. Investors will look for commentary on sales recovery at the Anthropologie brand, promotions, and updates on performance for the back-to-school shopping season.      Data from Statistics Canada will show the holdings of Canadian securities by non-residents for June. Foreign investors sold C$5.45 billion in Canadian assets in May.

The stock has far outperformed the broader market this year with a 17-percent gain.""The pace of growth was always bound to moderate as we came out of the exceptionally bad winter ...

Despite moderate 2015 U.S. GDP projections, housing data pointed to continued growth in the home-improvement industry,  Chief Executive Craig Menear said on a conference call. U.S. housing starts rose to a near eight-year high in July as builders ramped up construction of single-family homes, suggesting the economy was firing on almost all cylinders.

Same-store sales rose 4.2 percent, also ahead of estimates, according to research firm Consensus Metrix. U.S. same-store sales rose at a faster clip.  Home Depot raised its profit forecast for the year ending in  January to a range of $5.31 to $5.36 per share, from its earlier estimate of $5.24 to $5.27 per share. The forecast reflects this year's estimated $7.0 billion in share buybacks.The company said it now expected sales to grow 5.2 percent to 6.0 percent, above its earlier 4.2 percent to 4.8 percent range, partly due to last month's $1.63 billion acquisition of supplier Interline Brands.Smaller rival Lowe's Cos Inc (LOW.N) is scheduled to report results on Wednesday.

Fitch expects the  company to maintain leverage (adjusted debt/EBITDAR) in line with its publicly  stated commitment of at or modestly below 2.0x over the forecast horizon. With $89 billion in 2015 sales, Home Depot holds the leading position in the  U.S. home improvement industry, which is amidst a recovery from the prior  housing recession. Fitch's rating anticipates a continued recovery as well as a  benign competitive environment. However, Fitch believes that should the housing  recovery stall, Home Depot has the willingness and ability to use its cash flow  generation to maintain its leverage commitments. Solid Track Record Home Depot has grown comps and EBITDA margin every year since 2010, with 5%  average annual comps and EBITDA improvement of over 500bps from 2009 to 15.8% in  2015. Operating momentum has been supported by improvement in home improvement  industry fundamentals, especially regarding repair and maintenance projects.  Home improvement retailers have further benefited from benign industry square  footage growth (including very modest unit expansion from Home Depot and chief  competitor Lowes) and competitive resilience to the discount and online  channels.  Success in the home improvement industry requires significant investments in  inventory breadth and customer service, and discounters generally focus on  categories with narrow assortment needs and limited customer service. Online  competition, meanwhile, has been limited due to short purchase windows and the  bulky/heavy nature of home improvement inventory (note that nearly half of Home  Depot's existing online sales involve in-store merchandise pickup). Continued Growth Expected Fitch anticipates continued sales and EBITDA growth over the forecast horizon,  predicated on a continued U.S. housing market recovery and Home Depot's focus on  its strategic pillars of customer service, product leadership, and  interconnected retail. The company's growth initiatives are designed to leverage  Home Depot's existing scale to broaden its customer base and share of wallet.  For example, the recent acquisition of Interline Brands gives Home Depot access  to the underpenetrated residential facility maintenance and repair market.  Meanwhile, Home Depot is using its online infrastructure to expand product  assortment and offer customers increased product knowledge, while promoting its  in-store pickup capability. Fitch believes successful execution of its initiatives, coupled with industry  tailwinds, will allow Home Depot to generate 2-4% annual comps and revenue  growth. EBITDA margins are expected to remain around 16% though Home Depot could  leverage fixed expenses at the high end of its comps range. Modest annual EBITDA  growth is projected to yield annual free cash flow (FCF) of $4.0 - $4.5 billion  after dividends of approximately $3.5 - $4.0 billion. Disciplined Capital Allocation Home Depot's scale and stable growth has allowed it to comfortably manage to its  adjusted leverage target of at or below 2.0x for several years (1.9x at year-end  2015). Fitch expects management to continue to balance its leverage target  against its goal to return cash to shareholders, with incremental debt issuance  expected to support share purchases. Given Home Depot's leverage commitment,  Fitch believes management could pull back on share repurchase to maintain or  reduce debt levels should economic or operating headwinds limit EBITDA growth. KEY ASSUMPTIONS --Fitch expects comp sales to grow approximately 3% over the next two years,  supported by a continued recovery in the housing market and the company's  strategic investments; --EBITDA margin is expected to remain close to 16%, yielding 3 - 4% average  EBITDA growth; --Fitch expects $4.0 - $4.5 billion of annual FCF after dividends going forward; --Fitch expects FCF and some incremental borrowings to be directed to share  repurchases, as the company manages its adjusted leverage at or under 2.0x. RATING SENSITIVITIES Weaker operating trends or a move by management to more shareholder-friendly  policies that cause adjusted leverage to increase to the low 2x range on a  sustained basis could lead to a negative rating action. Continued positive operating trends together with a sustained reduction in  adjusted leverage to below 1.5x could lead to a positive rating action. LIQUIDITY Home Depot has a strong liquidity position supported by a cash balance of $2.2  billion at Jan. 31, 2016, together with an undrawn $2 billion credit facility.  The company also benefits from owning 90% of its stores. Home Depot is maintaining a very slow pace of new-store expansion, with plans to  build only five new stores in 2016. Low levels of capital expenditures (less  than 2% of sales) have resulted in strong FCF after dividends, which is expected  to track more than $4 billion annually going forward. Fitch expects Home Depot  would remain FCF positive in an economic downturn, as it did through the last  recession. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has affirmed Home Depot's ratings as follows: --Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A';  --Senior unsecured notes at 'A'; --Bank credit facilities at 'A'; --Short-term IDR at 'F1'; --Commercial paper at 'F1.'

142,"  SAN FRANCISCO Amazon.com Inc said on Wednesday customer orders for home services like plumbing and mounting TVs had increased 20 percent per month on average since the online retailer launched the platform last year. The marketplace allows Amazon, the world's largest online retailer, to enter the lucrative field of local services that is already crowded with review sites like Yelp Inc, Angie's List and start-ups like TaskRabbit.Adding local services to its offering makes sense for Amazon, which has said that over 85 million U.S. customers shop for products that require additional services like installation.   Erika Takeuchi, a spokeswoman for Amazon Home Services, declined to disclose the number of contractors that have so far signed up for the service but said it now offers 36 million pre-packaged services on the site, up from 2 million when it first began offering local services last year.Customers buying appliances like washing machines or TVs can choose to include professional installation services at checkout, making it attractive to buyers who might ordinarily make similar purchases at home improvement stores like Home Depot Inc.  Home services are now available across the country in 30 metropolitan areas and customer orders have been particularly brisk in New York, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., Amazon said.

Lowe's stock rose only 5 percent in the period. Investors had been relatively negative on Lowe's stock prior to the earnings and the stock was ""cheap"" compared to the past three years, J.P. Morgan analyst Christopher Horvers wrote.The outlook for the home-improvement industry remained positive for the rest of the year as gains in the job market and disposable income drive consumer spending, Chief Executive Robert Niblock said on a conference call on Wednesday.U.S. housing starts rose a stronger-than-expected 6.6 percent in April, data showed on Tuesday.Rising home prices were also encouraging consumers to invest in their houses, Niblock added.""The home improvement industry once again shows its resilient nature in an increasingly more difficult environment for retailers,"" Horvers wrote. Retailers such as Macy's Inc (M.N) and Target Corp (TGT.N) reported quarterly sales that missed Wall Street's estimates as consumer spending shifts away from apparel and accessories to big-ticket items including cars and homes.Separately, New York's Attorney General Eric Schneiderman reached a settlement with Lowe's and Home Depot over alleged violations of a 2010 state law designed to reduce water pollution.The attorney general alleged that 90 percent of Home Depot and Lowe's stores in New York violated the law by displaying phosphorus-containing lawn fertilizers without the required signage or failing to separate phosphorus-containing fertilizers from those without it.Lowe's agreed to pay $52,000 and Home Depot $78,000 in fines. Lowe's told Reuters that most of its fertilizers did not contain phosphorous and that its signage complied with the law. The company, however, agreed to settle to avoid lengthy litigation. SAME-STORE SALES BEAT  Lowe's raised its full-year profit forecast to about $4.11 per share from about $4.00. The company's same-store sales rose 7.3 percent in the first quarter, handily beating the 4.3 percent increase expected by analysts polled by research firm Consensus Metrix.   The jump also outpaced the 6.5 percent rise reported by Home Depot, only the second time Lowe's has outpaced its rival in nearly seven years.  The rise in Lowe's same-store sales increase also handily beat the 4.3 percent increase expected by analysts polled by research firm Consensus Metrix.  Mild weather in February helped drive outdoor construction projects, boosting demand for lumber, building materials and millwork, the company said.Excluding items, Lowe's earned 87 cents per share, beating the average analyst estimate of 85 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Net sales rose 7.8 percent to $15.23 billion, above analysts' average estimate of $14.87 billion.

159,"   By Steve Gorman and Nichola Groom | LOS ANGELES  LOS ANGELES California's power grid operators warned homes and businesses on Monday to conserve electricity as rising demand for air conditioning stoked by a record-setting heat wave across the U.S. Southwest tested the region's generating capacity.The so-called Flex Alert was posted until 9 p.m. Pacific time during a second day of triple-digit temperatures that strained Southern California's energy production, creating a potential for rolling blackouts on the first official day of summer.But the peak hour for energy demand came and went Monday evening without disruption of the region's power delivery network, the California Independent System Operator (ISO) reported.""Since we're past that and have not experienced any trouble, I think we're headed into the safe zone,"" agency spokeswoman Anne Gonzales told Reuters.Temperatures were expected to begin abating on Tuesday, according to weather forecasts. As of Monday night, there were no plans to extend the Flex Alert, ISO officials said.Monday's alert was the first big test of power generators' ability to meet heightened energy demands in the greater Los Angeles area without natural gas supplies normally furnished by the now-crippled Aliso Canyon gas storage field, effectively idled since a major well rupture there last fall.The oven-like heat prompted the city of Los Angeles to keep its network of public ""cooling centers"" - libraries, recreation centers and senior centers - open for extended hours as a haven for people whose homes lack air conditioning.Area home improvement and hardware merchants were doing a brisk business in fans and AC window units. Brett Lopes, 31, a freelance lighting technician, stopped in a Home Depot outlet near downtown to buy supplies for a homemade air conditioner he called a ""swamp cooler"" to use while he waited for his landlord to repair his broken AC unit.""It's brutal,"" he said of the heat, explaining that he looked up directions on YouTube for assembling the makeshift cooling device. ""It doesn't work as well as AC, but it's better than sitting in 100 degrees.""Others flocked to public swimming pools. ""It was really refreshing today, but more crowded than usual,"" said Paul Stephens, 31, a pastor who was swimming laps at the Rose Bowl Aquatic Center in Pasadena, where the mercury climbed to 108 Fahrenheit (42 Celsius) . BALANCING THE GRID The ISO, which runs the state's power grid, urged consumers on Monday to cut back on electricity usage, especially during late-afternoon hours.Utility customers were advised to turn off unnecessary lights, set air conditioners to 78 degrees Fahrenheit or higher, and wait until after 9 p.m. to run major appliances, such as clothes washers and dryers.Gonzales credited public cooperation with the flex alert for likely helping avert widespread outages on Monday. Large stretches of three states sweltered in a second straight day of record, triple-digit temperatures, as the National Weather Service posted excessive-heat warnings through Wednesday for southern portions of California, Arizona and Nevada, though the hot spell appeared to have peaked on Monday.Power customers ranging from homes and hospitals to oil refineries and airports are at risk of losing energy at some point this summer because a majority of electric-generating stations in California use gas as their primary fuel. Since the energy crisis of 2000-2001, the ISO has imposed brief, rotating outages in 2004, 2005, 2010 and 2015, mostly related to unexpected transmission line or power plant failures during periods of unusually high demand.With California's largest natural gas storage field shut down indefinitely at Aliso Canyon, state regulators have warned that Los Angeles faces up to 14 days of gas shortages severe enough to trigger blackouts this summer.     Aliso Canyon, owned by Southern California Gas Co, a division of San Diego-based utility giant Sempra Energy, normally supplies the region's 17 gas-fired power plants, hospitals, refineries and other key parts of California's economy, including 21 million residents.The gas leak there, ranking as the worst-ever accidental methane release in the United States, forced thousands of nearby residents from their homes for several months after it was detected last October.

160,"   By David Randall | NEW YORK, June 24  NEW YORK, June 24 Britain's unexpected decision to leave the European Union spurred a global stock market selloff that has inspired some opportunistic U.S. investors to move in the opposite direction.Operating on the belief that the initial rout might be an overreaction, even in some European stocks, several fund managers said on Friday they were buying up shares of big blue chips, domestic companies that are insulated from a lot of European activity and even European companies that might have been oversold.""We are looking to put cash to work in some of our favorite companies which are cheaper today,"" said Kevin Dreyer, the co-chief investment officer at Gamco Investors Inc, noting holdings such as razor blade and sunscreen-maker Edgewell Personal Care Co that were down more than 3 percent in morning trading.The benchmark S&P 500 was also down about 3 percent in midday trading.Still, some investors gravitated toward U.S. companies that are relatively insulated from Europe and can withstand what many expect are coming referendums in France and Scotland over their EU membership. U.S. stocks and bonds are a ""great"" buying opportunity on Brexit, said Gregory Peters, a senior investment officer at Prudential Fixed Income with more than $621 billion of assets.""Uncertainty will be a multi-year event, which will clearly benefit the U.S. from rates to risk assets (except for financials), as the U.S. will benefit from capital flows,"" he said. Several fund managers said they were drawn to U.S. companies that had little exposure to Europe.John Boland of Maple Capital Management, an investment manager based in Vermont, said his firm has been considering some stocks that look too beaten-down because of Brexit-induced turmoil. For example, he bought shares of Chipotle Mexican Grill  when it was below $400 a share early Friday.""They're a U.S.-focused company, so it was illogical for them to be down. That's what we're looking for, companies that have no ties or minimal ties to the EU market,"" Boland said. Salesforce.com Inc ""looks to be the most mispriced based on the Brexit vote"" among technology stocks because Europe accounts for only 17 percent of its revenue, FBN Securities said. And Gary Bradshaw, a portfolio manager at Hodges Capital Management, said he had put in buy orders Friday for companies such as Home Depot Inc that are more domestically oriented.Those who did take a chance on European shares during a selloff that sent the Euro Stoxx 50 index of blue-chips down about 7 percent said they focused on infrastructure companies with high recurring cash flows.Michael Underhill, a portfolio manager at RidgeWorth Investments, said that he was buying shares of Groupe Eurotunnel SE, which were down 14.5 percent, and Italian airport operator Atlantia SpA, which has fallen 9 percent, because he expects the market is over exaggerating the impact that the so-called 'Brexit' will have on European travel.""You will see some more passport controls and higher security, but at the end of the day the business of logistics and travel will keep grinding higher,"" he said.

161,"   By David Randall | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Fund managers on the hunt for dividends find themselves wading into the shares of consumer companies that typically attract investors looking for growth instead. One big reason for the move: traditional yield-heavy sectors like utilities and telecoms are trading at some of their highest valuations on record relative to the broad market. Fund managers see more to gain by buying companies that may offer capital gains alongside growing dividends at a time of low unemployment and an improving housing market. Also, some consumer stocks look relatively cheap at a time when Amazon.com Inc and fast online shopping have been threatening to upend the retail sector.""We've been nibbling at very high quality discretionary companies that are now cheaper because of 'Brexit' and worries about Amazon,"" said Ramona Persaud, a co-portfolio manager of the $7.8 billion Fidelity Equity-Income fund.  Companies that look poised to grow their dividends thanks to improving free cash flows are one standard deviation cheaper than traditional income-oriented companies measured by either price to earnings or price to book, she added.Overall, income-oriented funds have 10.1 percent of their portfolios invested in consumer discretionary companies, up from 8.1 percent three years ago, according to fund-tracker Morningstar. Cruise line operator Carnival Corp and big box retailers Home Depot Inc and Best Buy Co Inc are among those seeing new interest from income-oriented managers.  Each company offers a yield of 3.6 percent or less, on par with the 3.8 percent yield of utility-giant Duke Energy Corp. At the same time, Duke trades at a trailing price to earnings ratio of 21.6, compared with a 15.1 P/E of Carnival, which increased its dividend by 17 percent in April. The broad S&P 500 trades at a trailing P/E of 19.6, according to Thomson Reuters data.Scott Moore, a portfolio manager of the $37 million Buffalo Dividend Focus fund, said his fund holds Home Depot in large part as a play on the housing market that will not be hurt by online shopping.  ""This is a company in the discretionary space that's not going to be disrupted by Amazon,"" Moore said.

167,"   By Sruthi Ramakrishnan  Home improvement chain Lowe's Cos Inc (LOW.N) reported a lower-than-expected quarterly profit and cut its full-year earnings forecast, hurt by a shorter spring in the northern United States and fewer big-ticket purchases at its stores.Lowe's shares were down 6.8 percent in late morning trading on Wednesday.While Home Depot's sales got a big boost from big-ticket items such as appliances and roofing products, Lowe's reported average sales.Number of transactions worth over $500 rose 2.9 percent in the second quarter ended July 29, Lowe's said. In contrast, Home Depot reported a 9.5 percent rise in big-ticket purchases worth over $900.Sales in northern United States were challenged by a short spring, which hindered outdoor projects, Lowe's Chief Customer Officer Mike Jones said on a conference call.

Lowe's also lowered its full-year earnings forecast to $4.06 per share from $4.11, saying the cut reflected its acquisition of Canada's Rona Inc that was completed in May.Net sales rose 5.3 percent to $18.26 billion, below the $18.45 billion analysts had expected.

171,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, September 06 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A' rating to The  Home Depot, Inc.'s (Home Depot) proposed issuance of senior unsecured notes. The  approximately $2 billion of expected proceeds from the issue will primarily be  used for general corporate purposes including share repurchases. A full list of  ratings follows at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS The rating reflects Home Depot's strong track record of comparable store sales  (comps) growth, margin expansion and cash flow generation. Fitch expects the  company to maintain leverage (adjusted debt/EBITDAR) in line with its publicly  stated target of 2.0x over the forecast horizon. With $89 billion in 2015 sales, Home Depot holds the leading position in the  U.S. home improvement industry, which is amidst a recovery from the prior  housing recession. Fitch's rating anticipates a continued recovery as well as a  benign competitive environment. However, should the housing recovery stall,  Fitch believes Home Depot has the willingness and ability to use its cash flow  generation to maintain its leverage commitments. Solid Track Record Home Depot has grown comps and EBITDA margin every year since 2010, with 5%  average annual comps and EBITDA improvement of over 500bps from 2009 to 15.8% in  2015. Operating momentum has been supported by improvement in home improvement  industry fundamentals, especially regarding repair and maintenance projects.  Home improvement retailers have further benefited from benign industry square  footage growth (including very modest unit expansion from Home Depot and chief  competitor Lowes) and competitive resilience to the discount and online  channels.  Success in the home improvement industry requires significant investments in  inventory breadth and customer service, and discounters generally focus on  categories with narrow assortment needs and limited customer service. Online  competition, meanwhile, has been limited due to short purchase windows and the  bulky/heavy nature of home improvement inventory (note that nearly half of Home  Depot's existing online sales involve in-store merchandise pickup). Continued Growth Expected Fitch anticipates continued sales and EBITDA growth over the forecast horizon,  predicated on a continued U.S. housing market recovery and Home Depot's focus on  its strategic pillars of customer service, product leadership, capital  allocation, and interconnected retail. The company's growth initiatives are  designed to leverage Home Depot's existing scale to broaden its customer base  and share of wallet. For example, the recent acquisition of Interline Brands  gives Home Depot access to the underpenetrated residential facility maintenance  and repair market. Meanwhile, Home Depot is using its online infrastructure to  expand product assortment and offer customers increased product knowledge, while  promoting its in-store pickup capability. Fitch believes successful execution of its initiatives, coupled with industry  tailwinds, will allow Home Depot to generate 2% - 4% annual comps and revenue  growth over time. EBITDA margins are expected to remain around 16% though Home  Depot could leverage fixed expenses at the high end of its comps range. Modest  annual EBITDA growth is projected to yield annual free cash flow (FCF) of $4.0 -  $4.5 billion after dividends of approximately $3.5 - $4.0 billion. Disciplined Capital Allocation Home Depot's scale and stable growth has allowed it to comfortably manage to its  adjusted leverage target of 2.0x for several years (1.9x at year-end 2015).  Fitch expects management to continue to balance its leverage target against its  goal to return cash to shareholders, with incremental debt issuance expected to  support share purchases. Given Home Depot's leverage commitment, Fitch believes  management could pull back on share repurchase to maintain or reduce debt levels  should economic or operating headwinds limit EBITDA growth. KEY ASSUMPTIONS --Fitch expects Home Depot to produce comps in the 3% - 5% range over the next  two years, supported by a continued recovery in the housing market and the  company's strategic investments; --EBITDA margin is expected to remain close to 16%, yielding 3 - 4% average  EBITDA growth; --Fitch expects $4.0 - $4.5 billion of annual FCF after dividends going forward; --Fitch expects FCF and some incremental borrowings to be directed to share  repurchases, as the company manages to its adjusted leverage target of 2.0x. RATING SENSITIVITIES Weaker operating trends or a move by management to more shareholder-friendly  policies that cause adjusted leverage to increase to the low 2x range on a  sustained basis could lead to a negative rating action. Continued positive operating trends together with a sustained reduction in  adjusted leverage to below 1.5x could lead to a positive rating action. LIQUIDITY Home Depot has a strong liquidity position supported by a cash balance of $4.0  billion at July 31, 2016, together with an undrawn $2 billion credit facility.  The company also benefits from owning 90% of its stores. Home Depot is maintaining a very slow pace of new-store expansion, with plans to  build only five new stores in 2016. Low levels of capital expenditures (less  than 2% of sales) have resulted in strong FCF after dividends, which is expected  to track more than $4 billion annually going forward. Fitch expects Home Depot  would remain FCF positive in an economic downturn, as it did through the last  recession. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch currently rates Home Depot's as follows: --Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'A';  --Senior unsecured notes 'A'; --Bank credit facilities 'A'; --Short-term IDR 'F1'; --Commercial paper 'F1'.

174,"   By Sruthi Ramakrishnan  Home Depot Inc (HD.N), the No. 1 U.S. home improvement chain, did not lift its full-year sales forecast, implying a weaker-than-expected fourth quarter amid an improving housing market and higher consumer spending in the United States.The company also raised its full-year earnings forecast only to account for lower tax provisions and outstanding share count.Home Depot shares fell as much as 3 percent on Tuesday morning, reversing course from premarket when they gained after the company reported third-quarter profit and sales that beat analysts' estimates.The company, along with smaller rival Lowe's Cos Inc (LOW.N) is benefiting from higher wages and as rising home values as well as tightening for-sale inventories in many markets spur remodeling activity by homeowners.Recent housing data has also suggested that overall residential construction may rise again in the current quarter.However, Home Depot said it expects full-year net sales to rise about 6.3 percent and comparable sales to increase about 4.9 percent, maintaining a forecast that it first gave in mid-May when it reported first-quarter results. Home Depot raised its adjusted earnings forecast by 2 cents to $6.33 per share for the year ending January 2017.Analysts on average were expecting Home Depot's net sales to increase 6.4 percent and the company to earn $6.33 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.The full-year forecast implied that Home Depot was expecting comparable store sale to increase 3 percent in the fourth quarter, less than analysts' estimates of 4 percent and the 5.5 percent growth in the third quarter, Credit Suisse analyst Seth Sigman wrote in a note. ""We don't think there is anything in the Q3 results that would indicate a slowdown ... and the outlook for 2017 seems quite healthy at this point,"" Sigman said.Home Depot said the number of customer transactions rose 2.4 percent in the third quarter.

175,"   By Lucia Mutikani | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON U.S. retail sales rose more than expected in October as households bought motor vehicles and a range of other goods, pointing to sustained economic strength that could allow the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates next month.The Commerce Department said on Tuesday retail sales increased 0.8 percent last month, also boosted by demand for building materials, likely as households cleaned up and made repairs in the wake of Hurricane Matthew. ""This is just the kind of data the Fed doves need to see to convince them to hike rates in December. The economy is doing pretty well, this data is bullish for the economic outlook in the months ahead,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York. Adding to the report's strong tone, September retail sales were revised up to show a 1.0 percent increase instead of the previously reported 0.6 percent rise. The combined September and October sales gain was the largest two-month rise since early 2014. Sales were up 4.3 percent from a year ago. Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales jumped 0.8 percent last month after an upwardly revised 0.3 percent gain in September.These so-called core retail sales, which correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product, were previously reported to have risen 0.1 percent in September. Economists had forecast overall retail sales increasing 0.6 percent and core sales advancing 0.3 percent last month. The strong sales report is a good omen heading into the holiday shopping season. Last week, Macy's and Kohl's Corp expressed optimism about the holiday shopping season, despite reporting a decline in sales in the third quarter. U.S. stocks were trading mostly higher, while the dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasuries rose after declining for five straight trading sessions.SUSTAINED STRENGTH  September's upward revision to core retail sales suggests that the economy's 2.9 percent annualized growth rate in the third quarter could be raised when the government publishes its second GDP estimate later this month. Coming on the heels of data this month showing a rapidly tightening labor market and signs of a turnaround in the manufacturing sector, the upbeat retail sales report implied a pickup in economic activity early in the fourth quarter.  The Atlanta Fed lifted its fourth-quarter GDP growth estimate by two-tenths of a percentage point to a 3.3 percent rate after Tuesday's data.     The report also reinforced views that the Fed will raise interest rates at its Dec. 13-14 policy meeting. Rate hike prospects have also been boosted by a rally in U.S. stocks in the wake of the last week's election of Republican candidate Donald Trump as the next president, despite a lot of hand-wringing over his proposed policies.The Fed this month left interest rates unchanged but said its monetary policy-setting committee ""judges that the case for an increase in the federal funds rate has continued to strengthen."" The U.S. central bank raised its benchmark overnight interest rate last December and has held it steady since, largely because of concerns over low inflation. But inflation is creeping higher. A separate report on Tuesday from the Labor Department showed import prices increased 0.5 percent in October after gaining 0.2 percent in September.     In the 12 months through October, import prices fell 0.2 percent, the smallest decrease since July 2014, after declining 1.0 percent in September. Retail sales last month were driven by a 1.1 percent increase in auto sales and a 1.5 percent surge in receipts at online retailers. Online retailers like Amazon have been grabbing market share from traditional department chains like Macy's and Kohl's. Sales at building material stores increased 1.1 percent following a 1.8 percent rise in September. The strength in this category was reflected in Home Depot's robust third-quarter profit and sales reported on Tuesday.Receipts at sporting goods and hobby stores rose 1.3 percent. Sales at restaurants and bars, however, fell 0.7 percent, likely as the stormy weather kept people at home.Households also spent more on clothing, groceries and grooming last month, but cut back on furniture. Receipts at service stations advanced 2.2 percent on rising gasoline prices. ""As uncertainty over the election outcome remains elevated, October's retail sales performance provides some comfort that the primary driver of U.S. GDP growth remains on solid footing,"" said Sam Bullard, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.

177,"   By Sruthi Ramakrishnan  Home Depot Inc (HD.N), the No. 1 U.S. home improvement chain, did not lift its full-year sales forecast, implying a weaker-than-expected fourth quarter amid an improving housing market and higher consumer spending in the United States.The company also raised its full-year earnings forecast only to account for lower tax provisions and outstanding share count.Home Depot shares fell as much as 3 percent on Tuesday morning, reversing course from premarket when they gained after the company reported third-quarter profit and sales that beat analysts' estimates.The company, along with smaller rival Lowe's Cos Inc (LOW.N) is benefiting from higher wages and as rising home values as well as tightening for-sale inventories in many markets spur remodeling activity by homeowners.Recent housing data has also suggested that overall residential construction may rise again in the current quarter.However, Home Depot said it expects full-year net sales to rise about 6.3 percent and comparable sales to increase about 4.9 percent, maintaining a forecast that it first gave in mid-May when it reported first-quarter results.

""We don't think there is anything in the Q3 results that would indicate a slowdown ... and the outlook for 2017 seems quite healthy at this point,"" Sigman said.Home Depot said the number of customer transactions rose 2.4 percent in the third quarter.
