1,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, May 29 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a rating of 'BBB+' to Marsh  & McLennan Companies, Inc.'s (MMC) new issue of $600 million of 3.50% senior  notes due 2024. Fitch has also affirmed MMC's Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at  'BBB+'. A full list of rating actions follows at the end of this release. The  Rating Outlook is Stable. KEY RATING DRIVERS The affirmation reflects Fitch's expectation for a continuation of MMC's trend  of improved operating performance and stronger credit metrics that has persisted  for several years. MMC's consolidated EBIT operating margin, debt-to-EBITDA  ratio, and EBITDA-to interest coverage ratios have each been consistently strong  relative to the current rating category and are projected to remain so following  the incremental debt issue. In 2013, MMC's debt-to-EBITDA ratio and EBITDA-to interest coverage ratios both  improved year over year and are strong for the current rating category at  approximately 1.2x and 15x, respectively. Fitch estimates that pro forma for the  new debt issue, MMCs 2013 debt-to-EBITDA and EBITDA-to interest coverage ratios  would have been 1.4x and 13x respectively.  MMC appears positioned to sustain its recent performance levels in the near to  medium term due to a largely stable commercial pricing environment and gradually  improving macroeconomic environment.  In the first quarter of 2014, MMC's consolidated EBIT operating margin improved  to 21.2% versus 20.2% in the first quarter of 2013. The company's Risk &  Insurance Services (RIS) and Consulting segments both reported organic revenue  growth and margin expansion during the period.  Given MMC's prospects for solid earnings growth in 2014, Fitch therefore expects  these key credit metrics to remain strong for MMC's current rating category.  MMC's rating rationale includes the company's competitive position as one of the  world's largest diversified services firms, with major operations in insurance  brokerage and consulting.  The ratings also reflect MMC's strong financial flexibility. MMC reported  approximately $1.3 billion of cash and cash equivalents on its balance sheet as  of March 31, 2014, and also maintains a $1.2 billion multicurrency unsecured  revolving credit facility that expires in March 2019. There were no borrowings  under this facility as of March 31, 2014. Partially offsetting these favorable factors is the fact that, similar to other  insurance brokers that Fitch rates, MMC faces contingent risks, including  reputational risk and as an occasional target of litigation and regulatory  actions that can have a significant financial impact.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Longer-term rating triggers that could result in a rating upgrade include  sustained consolidated EBIT operating margins of 15% or better, accompanied by  debt-to-EBITDA ratios consistently under 1.3 and EBITDA-to-interest ratios  consistently in excess of 12.0x.  Key ratings triggers that could lead to a rating downgrade if observed over a  sustained period of time include MMC's debt-to-EBITDA multiple exceeding 2.0x or  the company's EBITDA-to-interest coverage ratio deteriorating to levels below  8.0x. Additionally, Fitch could downgrade MMC's ratings if the company incurred  additional, material charges arising from litigation or regulatory rulings. Fitch assigns the following rating with a Stable Outlook: Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. --$600 million 3.50% senior debt due 2024 'BBB+'. Fitch has affirmed the following ratings with a Stable Outlook: Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. --Long-term IDR at 'BBB+'; --Short-term IDR at 'F2';  --Commercial paper at 'F2';  --$320 million 5.375% senior debt due 2014 at 'BBB+';  --$230 million 5.75% senior debt due 2015 at 'BBB+'; --$250 million 2.30% senior debt due 2017 at 'BBB+'; --$250 million 2.55% senior debt due 2018 'BBB+';  --$400 million 9.25% senior debt due 2019 at 'BBB+';  --$500 million 4.80% senior notes due 2021 at 'BBB+'; --$250 million 4.05% senior debt due 2023 at 'BBB+'; --$300 million 5.875% senior debt due 2033 at 'BBB+'.

2,"   By Jon Herskovitz | AUSTIN Texas  AUSTIN Texas Stanley Marsh 3, who rose to prominence for his whimsical Cadillac Ranch art installation in the Texas Panhandle and whose latter years were tainted by accusations of sexually abusing children, has died at the age of 76, his lawyer said on Tuesday.    Marsh was an oil multi-millionaire and known throughout Texas for quirky feats such as building what he said was the world's biggest pool table in a cow pasture on the Texas plains. Marsh had been in failing health and died in hospice care, according to TV broadcaster KVII, a station Marsh owned from 1967 until 2002.Marsh was indicted in 2013 on more than a dozen counts involving the sexual molestation of children and was to stand trial later this year.The allegations first surfaced in a civil lawsuit filed by two boys who were 15 and 16 years old when the incidents allegedly happened in 2010. That suit was to have gone to trial in September. ""We had been looking forward to the opportunity to clear Stanley's good name,"" his lawyer Paul Nugent said.""The world has lost Stanley's grand imagination, philanthropic generosity and prankster personality,"" Nugent said.    Marsh, who considered the Roman numerals ""III"" to be pretentious and preferred the suffix ""3,"" is best known as the owner of Cadillac Ranch, which features 10 brightly painted Cadillac cars buried nose-first in the ground along Interstate 40 in the Texas Panhandle. Cadillac Ranch, built in the mid-1970s just off the fabled Route 66, is still a major tourist destination and has became a part of American culture as the subject of everything from a Bruce Springsteen song to an episode of the animated television show ""King of the Hill.""Marsh's pranks included making a 40-foot-long (12 meter) necktie that he placed around the chimney of his mother's home and throwing a party for a group of Japanese businessmen where he invited local men over 6 feet 4 inches (213 cms) to reinforce the idea of the long tall Texan, Texas Monthly reported. A separate lawsuit filed against Marsh in 2012 claimed he paid 10 teenage boys to engage in sexual acts both at his office in Amarillo and at his home, called Toad Hall, a reference to the Kenneth Grahame novel ""The Wind in the Willows.""

7,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, September 05 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a rating of 'BBB+' to  Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc.'s (MMC) new issues of $300 million of 2.35%  senior notes due 2019 and $500 million of 3.50% senior notes due 2025. A full  list of MMC's ratings follows at the end of this release. The Rating Outlook is  Stable. KEY RATING DRIVERS Fitch expects MMC to use the net proceeds of this offering for general corporate  purposes, which may include the redemption of the outstanding principal amount  of its existing $230 million 5.75% senior notes due 2015 and its existing $399  million 9.25% senior notes due 2019. As proceeds appear likely to be used  largely to refinance existing debt at a lower coupon rate, Fitch expects that  MMC's key credit ratios will continue to approximate recent levels once the  transactions are complete. Fitch generally views the prefunding of maturing debt favorably since it  eliminates refinancing risk and improves the company's long-term liquidity  profile from lower interest expense and extended debt maturities. MMC's consolidated EBIT operating margin, debt-to-EBITDA ratio, and EBITDA-to  interest coverage ratios have each been consistently strong relative to the  current rating category and are projected to remain so following the incremental  debt issue. In the first half of 2014, MMC's EBITDA-to interest coverage ratio and trailing  12 month debt-to-EBITDA ratio were strong for the current rating category at  approximately 18.1x and 1.4x, respectively.  MMC appears positioned to sustain its recent performance levels in the near to  medium term due to a largely stable commercial pricing environment and gradually  improving macroeconomic environment. In the first half of 2014, MMC's  consolidated EBIT operating margin was 20.3%. The company's Risk & Insurance  Services (RIS) and Consulting segments both reported organic revenue growth and  year over year margin expansion during the period.  Looking forward, MMC's operating results could benefit from moderate growth in  underlying insured exposure growth derived from a modestly growing global  economy. This benefit will be partially offset by a flattening primary insurance  pricing improvement and significant rate softening in most reinsurance lines.  These trends should have a modest net favorable impact on top-line growth in  MMC's RIS and Consulting segments. RATING SENSITIVITIES Longer-term rating triggers that could result in a rating upgrade include  sustained consolidated EBIT operating margins of 15% or better, accompanied by  debt-to-EBITDA ratios consistently under 1.3 and EBITDA-to-interest ratios  consistently in excess of 12.0x.  Key ratings triggers that could lead to a rating downgrade if observed over a  sustained period of time include MMC's debt-to-EBITDA multiple exceeding 2.0x or  the company's EBITDA-to-interest coverage ratio deteriorating to levels below  8.0x. Additionally, Fitch could downgrade MMC's ratings if the company incurred  additional, material charges arising from litigation or regulatory rulings. Fitch assigns the following ratings with a Stable Outlook: Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. --$300 million 2.35% senior debt due 2019 'BBB+'; --$500 million 3.50% senior debt due 2025 'BBB+'. Fitch's current ratings for MMC are as follows: Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. --Long-term IDR 'BBB+'; --Short-term IDR 'F2';  --Commercial paper 'F2';  --$230 million 5.75% senior debt due 2015 'BBB+'; --$249 million 2.30% senior debt due 2017 'BBB+'; --$248 million 2.55% senior debt due 2018 'BBB+';  --$399 million 9.25% senior debt due 2019 'BBB+';  --$497 million 4.80% senior notes due 2021 'BBB+'; --$595 million 3.50% senior notes due 2024 'BBB+'; --$248 million 4.5% senior debt due 2023 'BBB+'; --$297 million 5.875% senior debt due 2033 'BBB+'.

11,"  Shares of OnDeck Capital Inc, an online lender to small businesses, rose as much as 39 percent in their debut, valuing the company at about $1.84 billion.The company's successful debut follows that of online loan marketplace LendingClub Corp, whose shares rose as much 67 percent in their debut last week.The company's shares touched a high of $27.74 amid heavy trading on Wednesday. The stock was the biggest gainer on the New York Stock Exchange.Companies such as OnDeck Capital and LendingClub are cashing in on the demand created by the reluctance of cash-strapped traditional banks to lend to small businesses.OnDeck makes loans using its own pool of funds to small businesses such as hair salons and doctor's offices, unlike LendingClub, which connects borrowers with lenders on its peer-to-peer network. Jay Ritter, an IPO expert at the University of Florida, said  investors were showing optimism that LendingClub and OnDeck could compete profitably with traditional banks.OnDeck has lent more than $1.7 billion to small businesses and collected more than 4.4 million payments since its launch in 2007.

12,"   By Jonathan Stempel | NEW YORK  NEW YORK A lawsuit by two former Marsh & McLennan Cos managing directors seeking severance pay and stock awards after they were exonerated in a bid-rigging probe was dismissed by a judge on Monday.U.S. District Judge Paul Oetken said William Gilman and Edward McNenney did not show that their employment contracts entitled them to the awards, even accepting their claim that Marsh fired them in 2004 ""to appease"" then-New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, who was investigating the company.The insurance company reached an $850 million civil settlement in the probe.Oetken also said a jury could conclude that Marsh acted reasonably in asking that Gilman and McNenney be interviewed in connection with Spitzer's probe. Marsh had contended that their refusal could justify their being terminated for cause. ""There is, indeed, a limit to what corporations can ask employees to do in the context of government investigations,"" wrote Oetken, who sits in Manhattan.

Gilman and McNenney had worked at New York-based Marsh for a respective 28 years and 14 years.They claimed that Marsh, whose chief executive Michael Cherkasky was once Spitzer's boss in the Manhattan district attorney's office, subjected them to criminal prosecution in exchange for not being prosecuted itself. A New York state judge in February 2008 found Gilman and McNenney guilty of one felony antitrust charge after a non-jury trial.But in July 2010, the judge threw out the convictions, citing new statements by witnesses and the suppression of ""invaluable"" documents by prosecutors.Spitzer in October 2004 accused Marsh of rigging bids for insurance contracts and steering clients to favored insurers in exchange for kickbacks.

19,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, April 27 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has upgraded Marsh & McLennan Companies,  Inc.'s (MMC) long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) and senior unsecured debt  ratings to 'A-' from 'BBB+'. Fitch has also affirmed MMC's short-term ratings at  'F2'. A full list of MMC's ratings follows at the end of this release. The  Rating Outlook is Stable. KEY RATING DRIVERS The ratings upgrade reflects MMC's continued trend of improved operating  performance and stronger credit metrics that has persisted for several years.  The company has met all of Fitch's prior upgrade rating triggers and has  exceeded expectations on an absolute basis and relative to peers.  MMC's consolidated EBIT operating margin, debt-to-EBITDA ratio, and EBITDA-to  interest coverage ratios have each been consistently strong relative to its  ratings. Given MMC's prospects for solid earnings growth in 2015, Fitch expects  these key credit metrics to remain well within guidelines for MMC's current  rating category.  The company has successfully demonstrated consistent and material key credit  metric improvement over the past several years. MMC's 2014 EBITDA-to-interest  coverage continued to be excellent at roughly 16x, and financial leverage as  measured by debt-to-EBITDA remained moderate at 1.3x.  MMC has sustained improved performance levels due in part to a largely stable  commercial pricing environment, an improving global macroeconomic environment,  and reduced expenses. In 2014, MMC's consolidated EBIT operating margin was  solid at 17.2%. Both the company's Risk & Insurance Services (RIS) and  Consulting segments reported organic revenue growth and year over year margin  expansion during the period.  The ratings also reflect MMC's strong balance sheet and financial flexibility.  The company reported $2 billion of cash and equivalents at year-end 2014 versus  $2.3 billion in 2013, and also maintains a $1.2 billion multicurrency unsecured  revolving credit facility that expires in 2019. There were no borrowings from  this facility as of Dec. 31, 2014. Fitch expects free cash flow to continue  increasing over time due in part to expense reductions and projected earnings  growth. Favorably, pension plans are nearly fully funded, restructuring expenses  have recently been immaterial, and share repurchases are considered to be  discretionary in order to preserve liquidity. Looking forward, MMC's operating results could benefit from underlying insured  exposure growth derived from a modestly growing global economy. Exposure growth  benefits are partially offset by weakening primary insurance market pricing and  significant rate softening in many reinsurance lines. These trends should have a  modest net favorable impact on top-line growth in MMC's RIS and Consulting  segments. The rating rationale also considers MMC's top-tier competitive position as one  of the world's largest diversified services firms, with major operations in  insurance brokerage and consulting.  Partially offsetting these favorable factors is the fact that, similar to other  insurance brokers that Fitch rates, MMC faces contingent risks, including  reputational risk and as an occasional target of litigation and regulatory  actions that can have a financial impact.  The affirmation of Fitch's 'F2' short-term ratings is based on MMC's 'A-'  long-term IDR and continues to reflect MMC's strong liquidity position and  supporting contingency programs, and proven access to the capital markets. MMC  does not currently have any commercial paper outstanding. RATING SENSITIVITIES  Key rating triggers that could lead to a downgrade if observed over a sustained  period of time include:  --Debt-to-EBITDA exceeding 2.0x; and  --EBITDA-to-interest expense coverage deteriorating to levels below 10.0x; or --If MMC incurred material charges arising from litigation or regulatory rulings  that could affect long-term performance;  --If MMC were to report a material goodwill impairment that casts doubt on its  ability to generate future earnings and cash flows. Longer term key rating triggers that could lead to an upgrade if observed over a  sustained period of time include:  --Consolidated EBIT operating margins of 20% or better; and  --Debt-to-EBITDA approaching 1.0x; and  --EBITDA-to-interest expense in excess of 18.0x.  Fitch has upgraded the following ratings: Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. --Long-term IDR to 'A-' from 'BBB+'; --$250 million 2.30% senior debt due 2017 to 'A-' from 'BBB+'; --$250 million 2.55% senior debt due 2018 to 'A-' from 'BBB+';  --$300 million 2.35% senior debt due 2019 to 'A-' from 'BBB+'; --$500 million 2.35% senior debt due 2020 to 'A-' from 'BBB+'; --$500 million 4.80% senior notes due 2021 to 'A-' from 'BBB+'; --$250 million 4.05% senior debt due 2023 to 'A-' from 'BBB+'; --$600 million 3.50% senior notes due 2024 to 'A-' from 'BBB+'; --$500 million 3.50% senior debt due 2025 to 'A-' from 'BBB+'; --$300 million 5.875% senior debt due 2033 to 'A-' from 'BBB+'.  Fitch has affirmed the following ratings: Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. --Short-term IDR at 'F2';  --Commercial paper at 'F2'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.
