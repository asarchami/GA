1,"  * Challenge to GrainCorp emerges in Newcastle* Rivals consider further expansion into storage* Analysts say supply chain costs risk Australian goalsBy Colin PackhamSYDNEY, Jan 27 Still rattled by the veto of a A$2.8 billion ($2.5 billion) takeover by Archer Daniel Midland, Australian grains handler GrainCorp is facing aggressive competition that could cut costs for farmers but hit earnings at the country's biggest listed agribusiness.Lower costs could also help Australia, the world's second-biggest wheat exporter, fend off a challenge from lower cost producers such as the United States in its key Asian markets, including Indonesia, South Korea and Japan.GrainCorp operates eastern Australia's biggest grain port, handling as much as 60 percent of the region's wheat, barley, canola, chickpea and sorghum crops, and has more than 280 inland grain handling sites.Western Australian grain exporter CBH Group and commodity trader Glencore Xstrata are among backers of a new grains terminal in Newcastle on Australia's east coast due to open next month near GrainCorp's own terminal.GrainCorp's storage and handling business is facing rivals such as Singapore-based Olam International and Emerald Grain, half-owned by Japan's Sumitomo Corp, as mainly state-based groups and new foreign players move into each other's territory after a period of industry consolidation.""Given the decision regarding GrainCorp, I think there's an opportunity for organisations like ourselves to get into the grains sector,"" said Bob Dall'Alba, head of Olam Australia, which has also taken a stake in the Newcastle terminal.Analysts say Australia needs to improve its agriculture infrastructure to meet its goal of feeding the swelling middle class in fast-growing Asian markets.""Improving the efficiency of the entire supply chain is extremely important if Australian wheat is going to find a home at a profitable level for farmers,"" said Luke Mathews, commodities strategist at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. ""We need investment all the way through from the farm gate to shipping capacity.""A tonne of Australian wheat sells for around A$300 ($270) but the cost of production is about $6 higher than in the United States, the world's largest wheat exporter, said Graydon Chong, senior grains analyst at Rabobank.Although Australia enjoys a freight advantage into Asia, it risks lose its strong grip on the region.""We have seen (U.S. stocks) displace Australian wheat into markets throughout the Middle East and North Africa, and there's the potential to take market share in Asia,"" said Chong. CHALLENGERS MULTIPLY The new Newcastle Agri Terminal is located just a short walk from the existing Carrington Port owned by GrainCorp, which is regrouping after the planned takeover by Archer Daniels Midland  was rejected by the Australian government.Widely expected to go through, the takeover would have put GrainCorp in the hands of one of the world's largest grain handlers, giving it the muscle to consolidate its role as eastern Australia's dominant grain handler.Rejecting the bid last November, Treasurer Joe Hockey argued that the wheat industry had not become a fully competitive market since a national wheat marketing monopoly system was dissolved, making it a bad time to sell to a foreign company.Many local commentators also saw politics at play, as the takeover was vehemently opposed by the rural-based National Party, the junior partner in the new coalition government.GrainCorp's shares have since fallen 28 percent to a 22-month low, its then-CEO has left to run soft-drink bottler Coca-Cola Amatil and its regional grip is under challenge. The Newcastle Agri Terminal will provide an alternative shipping route for Australia's east coast farmers, allowing CBH and Glencore Xstrata to offer genuine competition.Rivals are also looking to build new storage faculties across the eastern seaboard, challenging revenues GrainCorp receives from farmers for using its up-country storage sites and potentially siphoning off users of its rail and port network.""The new providers are coming in and building their own storage sites, which they hope will operate more efficiently ... and offer them the potential to move grain cheaper,"" said CBA's Mathews.Small Melbourne-based grain handler Emerald, which is 50 percent owned by Japan's Sumitomo Corp, is building up-country silos, while CBH Group is assessing whether to build storage sites in the eastern states, industry sources said.The challenge for GrainCorp would be to find funds to invest in its existing system or mothball ineffecient facilties, said a Sydney-based grains analyst.GrainCorp said it was prepared for increased compeition.""We operate in a very competitive marketplace,"" said Angus Trig, the company's Director, Government & Media Relations. ""There is competition at each point of the supply chain ... We are used to competition.""The competiton meanwhile bodes well for the industry.""We are going through growing pains, but competition should eventually ... improve port access,"" Emerald CEO John Murray said in a speech last year.

ADM's agricultural services segment struggled to capitalize on the U.S. grain bounty as some farmers resisted selling at lower prices, striking a blow to its grain trading returns.Poor international merchandising results further dragged on the segment, including a small impact from cancellations of U.S. corn sales to China amid a dispute over an unapproved biotech variety.ADM viewed the slow farmer sales of corn in the United States mostly as a delay, similar to limited South American sales in the first quarter last year.

8,"   By Karl Plume | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Feb 12 U.S. agribusiness Archer Daniels Midland is tightening its grain moisture guidelines for corn shipped on barges to U.S. Gulf Coast export terminals beginning in August to better meet export standards, trade sources said on Wednesday.From Aug. 1, ADM will discount yellow corn barges with grain moisture above 14.5 percent, versus 15 percent previously, they said.The move would bring moisture specs for incoming corn in line with standards written into most export contracts, analysts said. Top importer Japan has been requiring 14.5 percent moisture U.S. corn for years, they said. It could also make it easier for ADM to manage corn export supplies in future seasons when a larger-than-normal share of incoming grain has a high moisture content. Last autumn, many exporters struggled to source enough dry corn to blend with wetter grain, which has less value in the export market.""The export market is pretty much 14.5 (percent) at the Gulf so I think they're trying to get some similarity there. Everybody got caught last fall with a high moisture crop that didn't make some of the specs they wanted,"" said Dan Basse, president of Chicago-based consultancy AgResource Co. Lower moisture guidelines by one of the world's largest grain handlers could prompt other exporters to make similar changes, Basse said. But the stricter guidelines could also make it tougher for ADM river elevators to source corn from farmers as long as competing corn buyers accept grain with 15 or 15.5 percent moisture without any penalty, trade sources said.It would also raise grain drying costs for farmers, they said.ADM did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",2014-02-12,ADM,"Wed Feb 12, 2014 | 5:31pm EST",ADM tightens barge corn moisture guidelines from August-trade,http://www.reuters.com//article/grains-adm-corn-idUSL2N0LH26S20140212?type=companyNews
9,"  * Farmers asked to exchange seed containing Duracade trait* Duracade corn plantings seen below 300,000 acres in U.S.* Gavilon, in deal with Syngenta, to accept crops with traitBy Tom PolansekCHICAGO, Feb 21 Archer Daniels Midland Co , one of the world's top grain traders, said on Friday it will not accept crops containing a new genetically modified Syngenta AG corn trait until major importers approve the strain.ADM said it will not take any commodity with Syngenta's Agrisure Duracade trait for domestic processing or export, joining rivals Cargill Inc and Bunge Ltd which have signaled they will limit their handling of the product.Corn seeds containing the Duracade trait are available for planting in the United States for the first time this year after U.S. authorities cleared the strain in 2013. The trait has not been approved for import by China or the European Union, both major buyers of U.S. crops.""For now, we reserve the right to test deliveries and decline those that contain Duracade,"" ADM spokeswoman Jackie Anderson told Reuters. The commercialization of Duracade has split the U.S. farm sector and pitted global grain merchants against Swiss-based Syngenta, the world's largest crop chemicals company. Some U.S. growers have said they want access to the new trait, which is engineered to fight pests called rootworms, while exporters warn it threatens to disrupt trade.ADM's decision was another blow to Syngenta after Cargill, the top exporter of U.S. grain and oilseeds, said last week it will not accept crops containing Duracade for delivery against export contracts. Bunge has signaled it will not handle crops containing the trait until it is cleared by major overseas buyers.GMO crops are controversial because critics say they are harmful to the environment and that food made with them can be harmful to humans.ADM said it was asking farmers to try to exchange any seed they had purchased for planting this spring that was not approved for all major export markets, including China. ""We recognize it's an extra step, but we're confident it's in the best interests of everyone involved in U.S. agriculture,"" Anderson said of the move.Syngenta on Thursday said grain trader Gavilon, owned by Marubeni Corp, had agreed to accept Duracade ""at market price while providing stewardship and distribution services for producers."" Representatives of Syngenta and Gavilon did not immediately respond to questions about the deal on Friday.The agreement will help balance farmers' access to new seed technology with ""maintaining markets for U.S. corn,"" the National Corn Growers Association said.Still, grain traders are wary of the new trait following China's rejection of more than 600,000 tonnes of U.S. corn and corn products containing another unauthorized GMO Syngenta corn trait, Agrisure Viptera, since November. Known as MIR 162, the trait has been awaiting Beijing's approval for more than two years. The National Grain and Feed Association (NGFA) and North American Export Grain Association last month asked Syngenta to suspend the commercial use of Duracade and MIR 162 in the United States until China and other export markets have granted regulatory approval.Duracade already has approval from buyers including Mexico, South Korea and Japan.Syngenta has declined the groups' request, saying the trait will be available in limited quantities and that growers need new technologies. The company has not said how many acres of U.S. farmland it expects to be planted with corn seeds containing Duracade.During a meeting with NGFA representatives in December, a Syngenta representative estimated Duracade could be grown on as many as 700,000 acres, the association said. However, ""recent indications from other sources"" indicate plantings may be somewhat less than 300,000 acres, according to the group.Corn was planted on 95.4 million acres in the United States last year.Even if corn containing Duracade is planted on a small number of acres, it could accidentally be shipped to China, exporters have said. Varieties are often mixed with each other because they are grown in fields close to each other and then harvested, transported and stored together.""Accidents happen no matter how rigorous a stewardship program is,"" NGFA President Randy Gordon said in an interview.",2014-02-21,ADM,"Fri Feb 21, 2014 | 6:26pm EST",UPDATE 1-ADM will not accept crops with new Syngenta GMO corn trait,http://www.reuters.com//article/syngenta-corn-adm-idUSL2N0LQ2BZ20140221?type=companyNews

11,"  CHICAGO Feb 25 Archer Daniels Midland Co  on Tuesday said its chief executive officer will give up the title of president to the agribusiness company's chief operating officer, effective immediately.Juan Luciano, who has been COO since 2011, will take on the role of president from Patricia Woertz, who had held the titles of CEO and president since 2006, according to a statement. Luciano will continue to be COO and to report to Woertz.Luciano's promotion ""recognizes the excellent results Juan has achieved over the last three years as he has focused the ADM team on improved returns and laid the groundwork for enhanced earnings power,"" Woertz said in a statement. An ADM spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for additional information. ADM, one of the world's top grain traders, suffered a blow last year when Australia rejected its bid to acquire grain handler GrainCorp Ltd. The acquisition was intended to increase ADM's access to fast-growing markets in Asia. Charges relating to the failed GrainCorp deal contributed to a 27-percent drop in ADM's fourth-quarter profit, overshadowing strength in its corn processing and oilseeds businesses as lower crop prices boosted margins.Shares of ADM on Tuesday were up 0.8 percent at 40.47.",2014-02-25,ADM,"Tue Feb 25, 2014 | 11:02am EST",Archer Daniels Midland CEO gives up title of president,http://www.reuters.com//article/adm-ceo-president-idUSL1N0LU1AH20140225?type=companyNews

13,"   By Tom Polansek | CHICAGO, March 3  CHICAGO, March 3 Bunge Ltd and Archer Daniels Midland Co, two of the world's top agricultural trading houses, on Monday said political tensions in Ukraine, a major grain exporter, were not affecting operations but that they were monitoring the unrest.""We have not seen any significant impact to business and continue to monitor the situation,"" ADM said in a statement.U.S. grain futures have climbed on concerns about potential trade disruptions in Ukraine. ADM, which has port facilities, an inland grain elevator system and an oilseed processing plant in Ukraine, said its primary concern was the safety of its employees. All were safe, according to the company.Bunge said its businesses were ""operating normally in Ukraine"" and that the company would monitor the situation. Bunge has a port in Nikolaev, a crush plant and packaging facility in Dnepropetrovsk, and an office in Kiev. Grain traders have focused their attention on Ukraine as tensions have mounted amid Russian military intervention on the Crimean peninsula. The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that Russia and Ukraine will export a total 26.5 million tonnes of wheat in the 2013/14 marketing season, or 17 percent of global shipments. In corn, Ukraine alone is forecast to export 18.5 million tonnes, or 16 percent of total exports.Ukraine will ensure that political turmoil does not reduce spring grains sowing, the country's new agriculture minister said.",2014-03-03,ADM,"Mon Mar 3, 2014 | 3:10pm EST","ADM, Bunge say Ukraine operations normal; monitoring situation",http://www.reuters.com//article/adm-bunge-ukraine-idUSL1N0M01JK20140303?type=companyNews

He said, however, he was open to ADM increasing its stake in GrainCorp to nearly 25 percent. Robb said he thought the opportunity for ADM to increase its stake was ""intended as a signal that the timing was wrong"" for its initial takeover attempt.""At the time, it was seen primarily from a competitive point of view,"" Robb said about the deal. There were concerns ""that it would cut across some very constructive transition and the buildup of competition that had been taking place in that sector after many years of being under a statutory authority,"" he added. A spokeswoman for ADM declined to comment.ADM Chief Executive Patricia Woertz last month said the company was pleased with its 19.8 percent stake in GrainCorp and had no plans to sell it.

16,"  (Updates with comments from Cargill and analysts)By Tom PolansekCHICAGO, April 8 Cargill Inc said on Tuesday its quarterly earnings fell 28 percent, making it one of the largest companies yet to demonstrate how big commodity market disruptions this year have hurt its bottom line.Minneapolis-based Cargill, a top global commodities trader, was hit by a triple-whammy of unexpected events, including a surge in energy prices in January, rail backlogs, and the rejection of U.S. corn shipments by China.The problems are likely to have also hit Cargill peers such as Archer Daniels Midland Co and Bunge Ltd, which are due to report financial results in the coming weeks.The coldest winter in 30 years catapulted regional U.S. natural gas prices to record highs, while power markets gyrated as producers struggled to keep supplies flowing to consumers. The harsh weather also snarled rail transport for products as diverse as coal, grain and ethanol.""In North America, we had record harvests and this extreme weather, so that created a backlog,"" Cargill spokeswoman Lisa Clemens said about the rail disruptions. ""We couldn't move grain or deliver products as fast as we would otherwise.""Cargill, one of the world's largest privately held companies, reported net earnings of $319 million for the third quarter ended Feb. 28, down from $445 million a year earlier. Revenue was $32 billion, nearly even with a year earlier.A trading loss in U.S. power markets was related to an ""unprecedented price spike"" in late January, Cargill said. It added that part of the loss has been recovered but provided no details. In February, the head of physical trading at Cargill's North American thermal energy arm left the company. Cargill was reported by an industry publication to have lost more than $100 million in U.S. energy markets.Cargill said last month it would stop trading coal and dealing in gas and power in Europe, but denied the moves were linked to the U.S. loss.The company's focus historically has been on grains and agricultural markets, rather than energy. ADM, Bunge, Cargill and Louis Dreyfus Corp make up the so-called ABCD firms that dominate agricultural commodities. RAIL SLOWS DOWN Cargill said earnings for its grain sector were down from a year earlier because of costs related to China's rejection of genetically modified U.S. corn. Further, there were generally ""limited opportunities"" in grain trading and storage, the company said.Grain dealers have struggled to find empty railway cars amid competition with oil shippers for track capacity.The surprise rejections by China were notable because it is important for Cargill to accurately assess the risks associated with counterparties in its transactions, said Chris Johnson, a credit analyst at Standard & Poor's. ""The fact that there is a bit of a counterparty surprise in the corn thing, that's the one that is more of an eyebrow-raiser,"" he said.Johnson said he was confident Cargill's overall loss exposure was ""well contained"" and that the Chinese rejections were likely not material to the company's credit rating.OUTLOOK FOR RIVALS Cargill's comments about limited opportunities for grain handling were ""somewhat surprising"" and offer a mixed outlook for ADM and Bunge, said Ken Zaslow, analyst at BMO Capital Markets.Cargill said export demand for beef was strong, which is a positive sign for meat companies Tyson Foods Inc and Hormel Foods Corp, Zaslow said.Shares of ADM were down 0.9 percent at $43.20, while Bunge shares were up 1.7 percent at $79.73. Tyson Foods shares were up 0.2 percent at $41.20, and Hormel was down 0.6 percent at $47.77.

17,"   By Marcy Nicholson and Tom Polansek | NEW YORK/CHICAGO  NEW YORK/CHICAGO Archer Daniels Midland Co (ADM.N) on Tuesday said it will keep its cocoa presses but still wants to sell its chocolate business after long-running negotiations to sell the money-losing operations to a buyer collapsed.Global agribusiness ADM said in a statement that extensive negotiations with a potential buyer did not reach an ""outcome that met ADM's objectives."" It did not name any suitors.Sources familiar with the discussions told Reuters last year that Cargill Inc CARG.UL had been in final-stage talks with ADM to buy ADM's cocoa and chocolate businesses. With ADM representing about a quarter of global cocoa bean processing capacity, the deal would have created a company big enough to compete with Barry Callebaut AG (BARN.S), the world's largest maker of industrial chocolate. Cargill declined to comment on ADM's cocoa or chocolate businesses.Legal experts have warned that the two companies' global reach and the concentration of capacity in Europe would have raised antitrust issues. ADM and Cargill make up part of a group of companies known as the ""ABCD"" that dominate the flow of agricultural commodities around the world. The other two are Bunge Ltd (BG.N) and Louis Dreyfus Corp LOUDR.UL.The news came as ADM announced plans to buy the remaining 20 percent stake of grain trader Alfred C. Toepfer International to give it 100 percent ownership. Since 2002, ADM has owned 80 percent of Toepfer; Union InVivo has held the remaining 20 percent since 2010. ADM's pursuit of a buyer for its chocolate business and its sale of South American fertilizer operations show that the company is focusing on its core grain operations, said Philippe de Laperouse, director of HighQuest Partners' global food and agribusiness practice and a former Bunge executive.ADM said it struck a deal to sell its fertilizer business in Brazil and Paraguay to Mosaic Company (MOS.N) for $350 million.(Additional reporting by Josephine Mason in New York; Editing by Leslie Adler and Lisa Shumaker)",2014-04-15,ADM,"Tue Apr 15, 2014 | 5:50pm EDT",ADM to keep its cocoa presses but to sell chocolate business,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-adm-cocoa-deals-idUSBREA3E1ZK20140415?type=companyNews

21,"  * Worldwide freeze order on Akhras's assets* ADM's lawyers taking steps to enforce jail term* Akhras based in BeirutBy David BroughLONDON, April 15 Britain's High Court has ordered a 12 month jail term for a Syrian businessman, Tarif Akhras, for contempt of court due to breach of contract in a deal with Archer Daniels Midland for food imports to Syria. Akhras, a relative of the wife of Syrian leader Bashar al Assad, had failed to pay $26 million to ADM for corn and soybeans supplied by the commodities house for import to Syria in 2011, according to ADM's lawyers.Under five separate contracts with the Tarif Akhras Group, the foodstuffs were shipped to Syrian port Tartous on two vessels, they added.Akhras, a Beirut resident and a well known commodities trader, had recently paid $2 million of the debt. ""We now have this order in place, and we are taking steps to enforce it,"" said Christopher Swart, partner for London lawyers Holman Fenwick Willan acting for ADM, referring to the jail order dated April 11.Legal representatives of Akhras could not immediately be reached for comment. ADM sold the foodstuffs to the Tarif Akhras Group before imposition of EU and Swiss sanctions against Akhras for giving support to Syrian authorities.In October lawyers for Holman Fenwick Willan won a worldwide freezing order against Akhras, in relation to the outstanding payment.The freezing order prohibited Akhras of disposing of his assets worldwide up to the value of $26 million.The prohibition includes Akhras's interests in a number of Syrian companies in which he is associated and is believed to trade, including Al Fagir for Trade Co, Tarif Akhras and Partners, and Middle East Factories Co.

22,"  (Updates with details on deal, background)April 15 U.S. fertilizer producer Mosaic Co  said on Tuesday it will buy Archer Daniels Midland Co's  fertilizer distribution business in Brazil and Paraguay for $350 million.Mosaic will acquire four blending and warehousing facilities in Brazil, one such facility in Paraguay and additional warehousing and logistics service capabilities. The deal is subject to regulatory approvals.The acquisition gives Mosaic ""a critical distribution platform in one of the world's fastest growing agricultural regions,"" Chief Executive Officer James Prokopanko said in a statement. ADM said it had been ""difficult for this business to consistently meet our return objectives"". Brazil is one of the world's biggest fertilizer importers due to nutrient-deficient soil and its huge annual crops of corn, soybeans and sugar cane. However, it can be difficult to move crops and nutrients because Brazil's transportation system is prone to bottlenecks.The acquisition of ADM's distribution business will accelerate Mosaic's growth plans in Brazil and ""replace a substantial amount of planned internal investments"" in the country, Mosaic said. As part of the deal, Mosaic agreed to supply ADM's fertilizer needs in Brazil and Paraguay for five years.Last year, Bunge Ltd completed the sale of its Brazilian fertilizer operations to Yara International  for $750 million in a move to streamline its agribusiness dealings. Through a long-term agreement with Yara, Bunge continues to supply fertilizer to farmers in Brazil.

25,"  (Corrects to two days from one day in paragraph 2)PARIS, April 17 French cooperative group InVivo said it would strengthen ties with agricultural trading house Archer Daniels Midland through their British joint venture - grain trader Gleadell.The announcement came two days after ADM, the ""A"" of a group of companies known as the ""ABCD"" that dominate global agricultural commodities trading, said it would buy InVivo's 20 percent stake in German grain trader Alfred C. Toepfer International for 83 million euros ($115 million). ""This transfer is accompanied by a strengthening of the strategic and operational partnership between the two companies, which each hold 50 percent of Gleadell, a major operator on the British grain market,"" InVivo said in a statement on Thursday. InVivo, a grouping of more than 200 farmer-owned cooperatives, declined to provide further details on exactly how the two companies would strengthen their ties in Gleadell. InVivo's chief executive said last year the two companies were considering developing operational ties in grain trading to increase their clout in volatile and highly competitive international markets.Gleadell is the third-largest grain buyer in Britain, trading over 2 million tonnes of grain per year, and a major supplier of seeds and fertiliser. It has been jointly owned by Toepfer and InVivo since 2001, according to its website.

26,"   By Marcy Nicholson | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Easter came early for the global chocolate makers this year.Just days before one of the busiest holidays for chocolate sales, Archer Daniels Midland Co (ADM.N) on Tuesday ditched long-running efforts to sell its niche cocoa business, easing concerns that have weighted on the market for months about a possible tie-up with ADM's closest rival.Minneapolis-based Cargill had been in late-stage talks to buy the business, which spans bean pressing in Abidjan in Ivory Coast to fine chocolate making in Belgium. The combined company would have been big enough to rival Swiss chocolate maker Barry Callebaut, the world's largest industrial chocolate producer.In the close-knit industry dominated by a handful of players, news that the ADM-Cargill deal was off the table brought relief to dealers, grinders and confectioners who had worried about erosion of their bargaining power.""A lot of people in the industry were concerned about the merger. A large merger the size of ADM/Cargill was going to have a significant impact (on) the market,"" said Julio Sera, senior risk management consultant for INTL FCStone in Miami.The combination would have created a cocoa powerhouse to challenge Barry Callebaut, and put at least half the global 4-million-tonne market in the hands of two players.In a short statement, ADM said it will now look to divest only its chocolate operations, a smaller business with six plants in Europe and North America. It plans to retain the bean processing business, maker of its premium-fetching ""deZaan"" cocoa powder brand. For ADM, the move marks a refocus on a business that makes cocoa butter and powder used in chocolate that has been one of the industry's largest for almost two decades, competing with Barry Callebaut, Cargill and other big cocoa traders Olam International Ltd (OLAM.SI) and Ecom Agroindustrial Corp.For players along the supply chain, the dust in the volatile, competitive industry has settled for now.COST-CUTTING PAYS OFF In announcing its about-face on Tuesday, ADM said extensive negotiations with a potential buyer did not reach an ""outcome that met ADM's objectives,"" but it did not name any suitors. Industry sources say that as cocoa prices have recovered from multi-year lows last summer, ADM may have haggled over the value of the business, estimated last summer to be worth $2 billion.Potential antitrust issues also likely played a big role in talks too. The firms' bean processing operations in Europe would have drawn regulatory scrutiny, legal experts had said.The region is by far the biggest for grinding beans used to make butter and powder that go into chocolate bars and cookies. Removing one of the biggest players could have forced Cargill to sell some assets to placate regulators, market participants said.Confectioners like Hershey Co (HSY.N) and Mars may have been big enough players in their own right to protect themselves from any undue influence over prices, but small- and medium-sized buyers would have struggled to maintain market share.In shifting its strategy, ADM must now find a buyer for the chocolate business, at a critical time for the downstream industry.Its cocoa processing has returned to profit after a cost-cutting drive and helped in part by a surge in butter prices, traders said. But the smaller chocolate business in an even more competitive market is still making a loss, the spokeswoman said.Some source suggested Cargill may be interested in the chocolate business.""I think it's a sign of the times,"" said Philippe de Laperouse, director of HighQuest Partners' global food and agribusiness practice.

Confectioners like Hershey Co (HSY.N) and Mars may have been big enough players in their own right to protect themselves from any undue influence over prices, but small- and medium-sized buyers would have struggled to maintain market share.In shifting its strategy, ADM must now find a buyer for the chocolate business, at a critical time for the downstream industry.Its cocoa processing has returned to profit after a cost-cutting drive and helped in part by a surge in butter prices, traders said. But the smaller chocolate business in an even more competitive market is underperforming, the spokeswoman said.Some source suggested Cargill may be interested in the chocolate business.""I think it's a sign of the times,"" said Philippe de Laperouse, director of HighQuest Partners' global food and agribusiness practice.

This is Pinner's second job in as many months. In April, he was made president of corporate strategic and financial planning, a new job created to drive ADM's business performance plans. He will relinquish that position. He is replacing Scott Walker who will become vice president of oilseeds portfolio optimization and will lead the sale of the underperforming chocolate business, it said. The changes come as ADM prepares to divest its chocolate manufacturing operations after ditching plans to sell the cocoa business in its entirety following the collapse of long-running talks.

46,"  SAO PAULO, July 31 The Brazilian arm of U.S. commodities trader Archer Daniels Midland Co received final government approval to ship soybeans and corn from its new terminal at the mouth of the Amazon, Brazil's official gazette said.The terminal outside Belem in Para state will have an initial annual capacity of 1.5 million tonnes of grain and will expand to 6 million tonnes per year by 2016, taking pressure off Brazil's crowded southern shipping routes.""The first trucks are already unloading soy,"" ADM said in a statement on Thursday. Of the initial volume, 80 percent will move on waterways, mostly from Porto Velho, Rondonia, in Brazil's interior. The rest will be trucked in until a railway is finished. The company said the new route will shave 34 percent off its freight costs from shipping out of Brazil's main port of Santos, thousands of kilometers south. ADM received approval for terminal use from waterway regulator Antaq last month in what it said was the first contract awarded under Brazil's new port law, which was passed in 2013 in an attempt to draw more private investment.Rivals Bunge and Cargill also plan to increase exports through northern Brazil, and dozens of companies are expected to follow as Brazil prepares to plant what could be yet another record soybean crop.

Cargill had been in final-stage talks to buy the combined operation, sources told Reuters last year.The sale will also allow ADM to ""redeploy capital for higher-return investments,"" ADM Chief Executive Patricia Woertz said.The agri-merchant has recently made a push into the food ingredient market, scooping up Swiss-German natural ingredient company Wild Flavors for about $3 billion. ADM's stock rose 1 percent to $50.37.DIVERGING STRATEGIES The deal highlights diverging strategies by two of the world's largest players in the niche cocoa market where merchants struggle with higher costs and tighter margins due to increased cocoa bean processing capacity. The move downstream into value-added chocolate products may protect Cargill from intense competition among cocoa processing, which make butter and powder used in chocolate, traders said. The company is one of the industry's largest bean processors.Late last year, it announced plans double capacity at its biggest European chocolate facility in Belgium. The acquisition is also a bet on long-term growth in demand in Asia, where consumers' appetites for candy and cookies is burgeoning, and in North America, the world's second-largest consumer of chocolate, where consumption has outpaced Europe and Asia.Adding ADM's facilities will double the number of facilities Cargill operates in North America and significantly increase its European footprint where it operates seven plants.

58,"  (Recasts, adds details, analyst quote and byline)By Karl PlumeSept 30 Archer Daniels Midland Co  strengthened its hand in the global grains marketplace by acquiring a stake in a second export terminal in the U.S. Pacific Northwest, a vital gateway for U.S. agricultural shipments to Asia.Illinois-based ADM said on Tuesday that it gained an ownership stake in the Columbia Grain export terminal in Portland, Oregon, by expanding its Kalama Export Company joint venture with Japanese grain trader Marubeni Corp, previously the terminal's sole owner.Export facilities in the Pacific Northwest handle about 30 percent of U.S. grain and oilseed exports, including about 50 percent of U.S. wheat exports, offering shippers the shortest route to lucrative markets in Asia. China is by far the world's largest soybean importer and Japan is the top corn importer. ""There's a lot of competition in the Pacific Northwest and having the option to export from two elevators rather than just one can make the logistics of exporting grain much easier. And if you increase competition, it increases flow and brings in more competitive prices,"" said Terry Reilly, grains analyst with Futures International.Kalama Export Company currently operates a bulk grain terminal in Kalama, Washington, about 40 miles (64 km) upriver from the Columbia Grain terminal. ADM and Marubeni each owned 45 percent of the Kalama terminal, with Mitsubishi Corp holding the remaining 10 percent. Under the expanded joint venture, ADM will own 32.2 percent of the two elevators, Marubeni will own 60.6 percent and Mitsubishi 7.2 percent, said ADM spokeswoman Jackie Anderson.The 50/50 ADM and Marubeni governance structure remains unchanged, she added. ADM did not disclose the value of the transaction but said the company expects to record a gain in the quarter ended Sept. 30. That preliminary value may be adjusted in the company's fourth quarter results, Anderson said.ADM and Marubeni also announced plans to rename its joint venture Pacificor LLC.Shares of ADM were 0.4 percent lower at $51.10 on Tuesday while Marubeni shares fell about 3.6 percent.(Reporting by Karl Plume in Chicago; Editing by Matthew Lewis and Tom Brown)",2014-09-30,ADM,"Tue Sep 30, 2014 | 6:29pm EDT",UPDATE 1-ADM-Marubeni venture expands in U.S. Pacific Northwest,http://www.reuters.com//article/adm-marubeni-grains-idUSL2N0RV2GC20140930?type=companyNews

He said the two groups were already working together on origination but did not give further details.InVivo had said earlier this year it would reinforce ties with ADM in their British joint venture Gleadell, after InVivo sold a minority shareholding in Toepfer International to ADM to give the U.S. group full control of the German-based trader. ""We're in the process of developing partnerships in order to have a more global outlook ... instead of having a trading branch that just markets the French origin,"" Blandinieres said.InVivo has been making changes at its trading division in response to stiff competition in export markets and after losses for the division in the past two years. To extend the international reach of the trading branch, which InVivo has separated into a entity called InVivo Trading, the group also plans to develop trading offices outside Europe, Blandinieres said.It intends to open a trading office in Singapore as part of a new group platform there targeting Asia, and wants to develop a similar hub in Brazil, he said.The overhaul of the trading operation is in turn part of a shake-up of InVivo's strategy that Blandinieres, who took up his post a year ago, is leading with the aim of doubling the group's sales within 10 years from just over 6 billion euros in 2012/13.InVivo's activities also span animal nutrition, farm supplies and garden retail.

65,"   By Karl Plume | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Nov 4 U.S. agribusiness Archer Daniels Midland Co on Tuesday forecast tighter U.S. ethanol margins in the fourth quarter following a steep drop in oil prices, but said its biofuel business will remain strong in 2015 due to the low cost of corn.Ethanol prices dropped in tandem with plunging energy prices in recent months as the summer driving season ended and inventories of the corn-based biofuel ballooned, eroding the strongest margins in years to the lowest in seven months.But margins improved modestly last month as producers curbed output and supplies and demand were now more in balance, Juan Luciano, ADM president and chief operating officer, said during a call with analysts following its quarterly earnings release on Tuesday. ""Ethanol margins were very healthy in Q3 and they dropped significantly as inventories climbed... We expect some of this volatility to continue, but the industry is behaving in a much better way than we saw last year,"" he said.ADM, among the country's top ethanol makers, said Tuesday its net third-quarter profit rose 57 percent from a year ago partly due to strong corn processing margins. Earnings in its bioproducts business, which includes ethanol, jumped more than 150 percent to $185 million. U.S. corn prices are hovering near the lowest level in four years, offering ADM and other U.S. producers of corn-based ethanol a cheap feedstock for the year ahead. ADM said domestic ethanol demand in 2015 is expected to be around 13.5 billion gallons, similar to this year, while exports could rise as much as 25 percent from an expected 800 million gallons this year.Lower oil prices have not dented ethanol export demand, but ADM is preparing for the possibility that oil prices remain depressed next year.""Brent, which is the big driver for our exports, is still at $82 and at $82 ethanol still does very well,"" Luciano said. ""At these oil prices we continue to see exports growing.""

73,"  (In 10th paragraph of Nov. 6 story, corrects name to Aakash Doshi, not Aakosh; clarifies his forecast is for production capacity not actual production)By Tom PolansekCHICAGO Nov 6 When Juan Luciano becomes chief executive officer of Archer Daniels Midland Co in the new year he will face easing demand for ethanol and increasing competition from global competitors.Falling gasoline prices and waning U.S. government support for ethanol are confronting Chicago-based ADM eight years after the company hired outgoing CEO Patricia Woertz, a former Chevron executive, in part to lead the company's growth in biofuels.ADM on Thursday said Luciano, chief operating officer since 2011 and president since February, will replace Woertz as boss on Jan. 1. Woertz, 61, will remain chairman of the board and is expected to retire in May 2016.Since Woertz became CEO in April 2006, ADM shares are up about 49 percent, compared to gains of 59 percent for rival Bunge Ltd and 99 percent for The Andersons, a smaller agribusiness firm. Woertz and Luciano declined interview requests from Reuters. A company spokeswoman offered no immediate comment beyond statements of confidence from the executives.Analysts were guarded about expectations once Luciano takes over.""I wouldn't say I'm expecting some kind of transformational event in how the company runs its business,"" said Jeff Stafford, equity analyst for Morningstar. ""There's only so much you can do."" Earnings in ADM's bioproducts business, which includes ethanol, in the third quarter jumped more than 150 percent on the year to $185 million. The coming years will likely be leaner, analysts said.The ethanol business has relied heavily on support from government mandates, and a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency proposal to lower its mandated renewable fuel targets is ""a long-term negative"" for ADM and other ethanol producers, said Joseph Agnese, S&P Capital IQ equity analyst.U.S. ethanol production capacity by the end of the decade may increase to 16 billion gallons from 13.3 billion in 2013, said Aakash Doshi, vice president of commodities research for Citigroup. That is slow compared to the 8.4-billion gallon production increase since Woertz became CEO in 2006. ADM's global footprint is another challenge for the new CEO because the company is more focused on the United States than competitors Bunge and Cargill Inc. Traders said they expect Luciano to look for expansion opportunities, particularly in China.Australia last year rejected ADM's planned takeover of grain handler GrainCorp Ltd, an acquisition intended to provide access to fast-growing markets in Asia.Last month, ADM completed a $3 billion deal for natural ingredient company Wild Favors, its biggest acquisition ever.""With ADM, it's a question of balancing their activities,"" said Philippe de Laperouse, director of consultancy HighQuest Partners' global food and agribusiness practice and a former Bunge executive.Massive U.S. harvests are positive for ADM because they increase the volume of crops available to trade, process and transport. But it is difficult for ADM to differentiate itself because rivals have similar assets around the world, traders said.

The firm was majority owned by Goldner Hawn Johnson & Morrison, a private equity investment firm.Campbell, through an ADM spokeswoman, declined to be interviewed. She said she did not know who would replace him in the oilseeds unit.The management change illustrates the emphasis ADM is placing on growing its ingredients business as it tries to improve returns and is the latest shake-up in leadership at the agribusiness company. Last month, ADM named Greg Morris, who oversaw all North American oilseeds processing, as president of its new Wild Flavors and Specialty Ingredients business unit, which will include Specialty Commodities. ADM is creating the unit as part of this year's $3 billion acquisition of natural flavorings firm Wild Flavors. Morris also had led ADM’s specialty products business.

She said she did not know who would replace him in the oilseeds unit. The management change illustrates the emphasis ADM is placing on growing its ingredients business as it tries to improve returns and is the latest shake-up in leadership at the agribusiness company.Last month, ADM named Greg Morris, who oversaw all North American oilseeds processing, as president of its new Wild Flavors and Specialty Ingredients business unit, which will include Specialty Commodities. ADM is creating the unit as part of this year's $3 billion acquisition of natural flavorings firm Wild Flavors. Morris also had led ADM's specialty products business. ADM on Nov. 4 reported that adjusted third-quarter earnings jumped 72 percent as gains in corn processing and agricultural services more than offset flat results in oilseed processing. However, revenues fell from a year earlier and missed Wall Street estimates.Operating profits for oilseeds processing in the nine months ended Sept. 30 were $1 billion, up 2.8 percent from the same period the previous year.ADM is increasing its focus on ingredients ahead of the departure of Chief Executive Patricia Woertz. Earlier this month, the company said she will step down at the end of the year and be replaced by Juan Luciano, chief operating officer and president.

76,"  (Adds details, background, ADM quote, Syngenta comment; adds byline)By Karl PlumeNov 19 Archer Daniels Midland Co sued seed company Syngenta AG on Wednesday over sales of a genetically modified corn variety not approved for import by China, joining more than 100 farmers and exporters in pursuing damages from the Swiss-based company.The lawsuit alleges that Syngenta commercialized the MIR162 corn variety, also known as Agrisure Viptera, without creating an effective stewardship program to ensure the grain would not be shipped to markets that have not approved it. China has over the past year rejected shipments of more than 1 million tonnes of U.S. corn and corn products because they contained MIR162 grain.The variety, planted on about 3 percent of U.S. corn acres during the past two years, can be found throughout the American supply chain because it has not been segregated from other varieties since its launch in 2011. ""These rejections have resulted in very substantial losses to U.S. exporters who have had their shipments to China turned away, including tens of millions of dollars in damages to ADM,"" the Chicago-based company said in its lawsuit, which was filed in a state court in Louisiana.ADM's lawsuit alleges that Syngenta did not effectively put into effect a stewardship program designed to keep the MIR162 strain out of export channels until import approvals were granted by all major foreign markets. Syngenta said the lawsuit was without merit.Fellow grain exporters Cargill Inc and Trans Coastal Supply Co have also sued Syngenta seeking damages linked to China's rejection of shipments. A group of Midwest farmers filed coordinated lawsuits last month seeking damages suffered from the drop in corn prices tied to the trade disruption, which the National Grain & Feed Association has estimated at more than $1 billion.The case is Archer Daniels Midland Company v. Syngenta Corporation, Syngenta Seeds Inc and Syngenta Crop Protection LLC, 29th Judicial District Court for the Parish of St. Charles, State of Louisiana, No. 79219.

82,"  (Adds details on sellers, buyers, background, futures prices)By Karl PlumeCHICAGO Dec 16 Chinese buyers signed nine contracts for a total of more than 1 million tonnes of U.S. soybeans at a ceremony in Chicago on Tuesday.The purchases are for delivery to China, the world's top soy importer, in calendar year 2015, said a U.S. trader at the ceremony. The ceremony was held on the first day of the U.S.-China Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade, which runs through Thursday.Buyers included state importers COFCO and Sinograin Oil Corp as well as Yihai Kerry Group, Chinatex Grains & Oils, Yuntianhua USA Inc and Jiusan USA Inc. They signed deals to buy from Archer Daniels Midland Co, Zen-Noh Grain, Louis Dreyfus, Cargill, Gavilon and Noble-Agri. ""These contracts were maybe for 100,000 or 200,000 tonnes apiece,"" said a U.S. soy trader who requested anonymity. ""We know they are going to buy the beans every year, but this type of ceremony really reinforces the relationship with our biggest customer.""The deals had little impact on soybean futures prices at the Chicago Board of Trade, which languished near the session lows they hit before the ceremony. CBOT January soybeans were down 13-1/2 cents at $10.26 a bushel at 12:10 p.m. CDT (1810 GMT). Traders said the agreements were relatively small for China, which is expected to import 74 million tonnes of the oilseed in the 2014/15 marketing year. The U.S. Agriculture Department's export inspections report issued on Monday showed more than 1.3 million tonnes of soybeans destined for China were inspected in the past week.Traders do not expect all of the agreed-upon contracts to show up in the USDA's daily reporting system, which requires exporters to report large sales to a single destination within a day. Some of the signings on Tuesday will remain ""frame contracts"" with no specified price or shipping terms until a later date.A similar signing ceremony in Milwaukee in September yielded purchase agreements for 4.8 million tonnes of U.S. soybeans. The USDA confirmed nearly 2 million tonnes in Chinese soy purchases over the next three days.

84,"  Olam International Ltd's $1.3 billion deal to buy Archer Daniels Midland Co's cocoa business will create one of the world's top cocoa bean processors and traders, rivaling Barry Callebaut AG and Cargill Inc.With eight facilities from Singapore to the Ivory Coast, ADM has bean processing capacity of 600,000 tonnes per year, equating to about 14 percent of annual global output.Global grinding capacity is expected to hit a record of 4.2 million tonnes in 2013/14, according to the most up-to-date estimates from the International Cocoa Organization, mainly due to expansion in Asia to meet burgeoning demand for chocolate in emerging economies.Grinding beans produces butter, used in chocolate bars, as well as powder, which is used for chocolate flavoring in cookies, ice cream and drinks.Here are some key facts about the two companies' cocoabusiness.ADM:   The Chicago-based firm has eight cocoa bean processing facilities: Ontario, Canada; Koog aan de Zaan and Wormer, the Netherlands; Mannheim, Germany; Ilheus, Brazil; Abidjan, Ivory Coast; Kumasi, Ghana; and, Singapore.Earlier this year, ADM said it would close its ninth and only U.S. grinding facility in Hazleton, Pennsylvania.The facilities have total annual capacity of 600,000 tonnes per year in the 4 million-tonne industry. Olam:The Singapore-based commodity merchant has five cocoa processing plants: Nigeria, United Kingdom, Spain, Ivory Coast and Indonesia, the last of which opened in May. Olam has a cocoa processing capacity of 100,000 tonnes per year. With the ADM assets, its total capacity will reach 700,000 tonnes, or 16 percent of the world's total capacity.  Olam said it is the largest player in cocoa sourcing in the world and expects to be sourcing 900,000 tonnes of beans per year after the deal is closed, or just over 20 percent of the world's total production. The Indonesian plant will have capacity of 60,000 tonnes per year and its facility in the Ivory Coast, the world's top grower, will have annual capacity of 75,000 tonnes.The company sources most of its beans in Africa, with an extensive footprint spanning Ivory Coast, Ghana, Nigeria, Cameroon and Republic of Congo in West Africa as well as Tanzania and Uganda in East Africa, its website says.The cocoa business is headquartered in London, with marketing offices in New Jersey, Singapore, Spain, Kiev and Moscow.

It repeated those expectations in a briefing on Tuesday, arguing that growing emerging market demand for chocolate would necessitate additional grinding and pressing capacity, despite concerns about over-capacity as some bean processors have cut back on grinding amid high stocks of butter powder.

90,"   By Chris Prentice | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Feb 3 U.S. agribusiness Archer Daniels Midland Co on Tuesday said ethanol producers will have to cut output amid high stocks and stagnating demand, as the industry's woes deepen with the oil rout and squeezed margins.Inventories have swelled to two-year highs as demand struggles to keep pace with high output. U.S. ethanol makers ramped up production as ethanol futures rose through early December, bucking pressure from falling global oil prices and as corn input costs declined.But front-month ethanol futures have tumbled nearly 40 percent from those December highs to about $1.45 a gallon.Those conditions will spur ""some rationalization of capacity,"" Juan Luciano, ADM's president and chief executive officer, said on a call with investors to discuss last quarter's earnings.ADM was still booking ethanol profits, but pressured margins are leaving higher-cost producers with ""some problems,"" Luciano said. A significant chunk of biofuels manufacturers are facing margins at or below costs, according to industry estimates.""Production will be falling in the coming months, because about 20-30 percent of the industry is at break-even or losing money,"" said Farha Aslam, an analyst with Stephens Inc in New York, noting she expects domestic demand to remain around 13.5 billion to 14 billion gallons.Until the industry works through those stocks, margins will remain ""challenged,"" said Luciano. U.S. supplies have risen to the highest since December 2012, U.S. Energy Information Administration data showed last week.ADM forecast total U.S. exports in 2015 to remain stable from the prior year at about 800 million gallons, a dampening of the company's outlook last quarter of exports to increase as much as 25 percent.That arrives against a backdrop of uncertainty over biofuels policy, as the industry awaits finalized mandates from the U.S. government on how much biofuel needs to be blended into gasoline. U.S. producers generated record volumes of ethanol last year, exceeding targets mandated by the U.S. government, but have swiftly approached the so-called ""blend wall,"" the maximum amount of biofuel that can be blended into gasoline.ADM's bleaker outlook arrives after crude oil prices  have slumped more than 40 percent over the last year.""With oil so cheap, why would you blend more than you have to?"" said Steve Nicholson, a grains and oilseed analyst with Rabobank AgriFinance in St. Louis, Missouri.The situation is similar to one two years ago, when squeezed margins prompted a wave of shutdowns.""Smaller, less efficient plants shut down from six to nine months,"" Nicholson said. ""There's no reason that won't happen again.""

91,"   By Karl Plume | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Feb 3 Plans by commodities trading rivals Archer Daniels Midland Co and Glencore PLC  to jointly develop an export terminal in northern Brazil promise to shift grain flows both within South America's largest producer and to Asian importers.ADM will give Glencore 50 percent in its Barcarena export terminal in Brazil's Para state, it said on Tuesday, the Swiss-based company's first foray into Brazilian grain ports.The companies plan to quadruple the facility's annual capacity to 6 million tonnes, making it one of the country's largest grain export terminals.Terms of the deal and the timeline for expansion were not disclosed. The two grains heavyweights hope to tap rising crop production in northern Brazil, eyeing the upcoming expansion of the Panama Canal for a more direct route to Asia, industry analysts said. Northern ports are also easier and cheaper for exports from northern Mato Grosso, Brazil's top soybean state.Brazil currently exports the majority of its crops through southern ports such as Santos and Paranagua, which have become congested as a result. Investments in better roads in recent years have opened a path to northern ports. ""The global players are all lining up to participate in what is expected to be a boom,"" said Pedro Dejneka, managing partner with AGR Brasil, a unit of consultancy AgResource Co.""The pie is plenty large for everyone to participate but these northern ports need to exist if Brazil wants to expand production in the next decade"" and be competitive globally, he added. Accessing Barcarena from Brazil's center-west grain belt requires trucking over the BR-163 highway to river ports in the Amazon, where grains are sent by barge to ports for loading into bulk grain ships.Rival grain trader Bunge Ltd started shipping out of Barcarena last year. Cargill Inc has moved only a small amount of grain on barges deep in the Amazon to northern ports over the past decade.Glencore's South American grain port facilities include a wholly-owned terminal in Bahia Blanca and a joint venture in Timbues, both in Argentina. Its Brazilian assets include wheat and sugar mills and a soy processing plant but no port facilities.Brazil's ports minister said last year grains shipments through northern ports could rise from 3 to 4 million tonnes to 15 million tonnes by 2020. Brazil's total corn and soybean exports are projected to top 65 million tonnes this season.

94,"   By Karl Plume | CHICAGO  CHICAGO U.S. agribusiness Archer Daniels Midland Co (ADM.N) on Tuesday reported higher quarterly earnings as a record-large U.S. harvest boosted grain volumes and supported strong exports, though revenue fell short of expectations.Earnings in agricultural services, ADM's biggest business segment in terms of revenue, grew as bumper U.S. corn and soybean crops replenished thinned inventories of the crops that the Illinois-based company buys, sells, stores and processes.ADM is one of four large agribusinesses known as the ABCDs that dominate the global grain trade. The others are Bunge Ltd (BG.N), Cargill Inc [CARG.UL] and Louis Dreyfus Corp [LOUDR.UL].Cargill Inc last month reported a 41-percent profit surge in its latest quarter as lower grain prices raised demand for crops and padded margins on its meat sales.Good oilseed crush margins in North America and Europe underpinned ADM's soybean processing results, but that was offset by slow farmer sales in South America.Higher profits from ethanol underpinned corn processing results for ADM, one of the country's top producers of the corn-based biofuel, although rising grain costs in the quarter partly offset the gains.  The company warned of headwinds from deteriorating ethanol margins in 2015.""While U.S. ethanol demand was seasonally strong, boosted by the domestic response to lower gasoline prices, high industry production has built excess inventories. Margins in this industry should remain challenged until supplies are better aligned with demand,"" Chief Executive Juan Luciano said.ADM reported net earnings of $701 million, or $1.08 per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, up from $374 million, or 56 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding special items such as charges related to ADM's purchase of flavorings company WILD Flavors, earnings were $1.00 per share, up from 95 cents a year earlier and above the analysts' average estimate of 94 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.ADM finalized its purchases of WILD Flavors and natural ingredients company Specialty Commodities Inc during the fourth quarter and will include those results in a new business segment beginning with the first quarter 2015.Revenue fell to $20.89 billion from $24.14 billion, missing the consensus expectation of $23.85 billion.

103,"   By Rod Nickel and Chris Prentice | WINNIPEG/NEW YORK  WINNIPEG/NEW YORK Feb 25 Archer Daniels Midland , one of the world's top biofuels producers, has slowed North American biodiesel output, the latest sign the industry is battling uncertainty over U.S. renewable fuel policy while the oil rout curbs demand.The Chicago-based agri business has ""temporarily"" shifted production at its Velva, North Dakota, oilseeds processing facility from biodiesel to other products and cut production at its other North American facilities, ADM spokeswoman Jackie Anderson said in an emailed statement.""We will continue to evaluate the market, and look forward to resuming production when conditions improve,"" she said.With 140 million gallons of annual capacity at its wholly-owned Velva site and two joint ventures in Missouri, ADM is a sizeable player in the 2-billion gallon U.S. industry.It also runs a plant with 70 million gallons of capacity in Lloydminster, Canada. The ADM spokeswoman declined to give the timing and size of the cutbacks. The Northern Canola Growers Association said the switch in North Dakota took place a few months ago.The move is a sign of the ""strain"" being felt across the industry after a year-long drop in biodiesel prices and oil's second-worst rout in history, said Steve Nicholson, an analyst with Rabobank AgriFinance in St. Louis, Mo. ""There's no question we'll see idling of plants and we may see consolidation or people getting out altogether,"" he said.Late last year, diesel's discount to B99/B100 biodiesel was at its widest since 2011, according to the latest data from the U.S. Department of Energy.Other major U.S. producers include Renewable Energy Group Inc. and Cargill Inc., but the industry also has many small, independent players. Uncertainty over decade-old federal policy aimed at energy independence and cutting carbon emissions has added to the industry's woes.The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which implements the Renewable Fuels Standard program has not yet set biofuel blending requirements for last year, 2015, and 2016.A $1-per-gallon tax credit expired in December.Biodiesel producers represent a sliver of the 17 billion-gallon U.S. renewable fuels market, but they are not alone: ethanol makers, which produce a corn-based fuel, are also feeling the crunch. A Reuters analysis showed average ethanol margins are at their lowest levels since 2005.

107,"  BARCELONA, March 31 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Leading agricultural processor and food-ingredient supplier Archer Daniels Midland Company has agreed to stop deforestation due to soy and palm oil production in its global supply chains, according to investors.Chicago-based ADM, one of the world's biggest soy traders and a top soy exporter in Latin America, joins a growing group of multinational firms that are taking action to ensure their businesses do not destroy forests around the globe.New commitments from companies related to reducing deforestation jumped 80 percent in 2013-14, meaning more companies are taking the problem seriously, according to a recent report from Forest Trends, a Washington-based NGO.ADM's move came in response to pressure by shareholders Green Century Capital Management, which manages fossil fuel-free mutual funds, and the New York State Common Retirement Fund. They have now withdrawn a proposal outlining the investment risks associated with deforestation.""ADM's commitment to using only sustainably sourced palm and soy products validates our message that strong environmental policies make economic sense,"" said New York State Comptroller Thomas P. DiNapoli.""Business practices that destroy the environment and foster climate change can not only harm the public, but can damage corporations' reputations, their bottom line and their investors,"" he added.Since 2000, more than 60 million hectares of tropical forest have been converted to agriculture, according to Forest Trends.Agriculture is widely recognised as the largest driver of deforestation globally, and is linked to 80 percent of forest loss around the world, the London-based Overseas Development Institute (ODI) says in a new report. The report, published on Monday, argues that government subsidies for agricultural commodities are undermining international aid to protect forests, and should be reformed.""While international forest aid seeks to promote private investment in forest protection, governments around the globe are incentivising commodities that drive deforestation,"" said Will McFarland, the report's co-author.In Brazil and Indonesia, where over half the world's deforestation occurs, an average of $41 billion of domestic public finance has been spent each year subsidising some of the leading causes of that forest loss, around 127 times what the two countries received in annual forest aid, the ODI said.Subsidies influence both investment and consumption patterns by reducing the price of a natural resource. ""Subsidies can accelerate environmental degradation through resource inefficiency, over-capitalisation, over-consumption and by depriving the state of resources to support sustainable management,"" the report said.It can be difficult to track their impact, as they come in various forms and are often not directly earmarked for a particular commodity, it added.The researchers identified 48 different domestic subsidies to support Indonesia's palm oil and timber industries and Brazil's beef and soy sectors.PILOT SOY STANDARD  In addition, even though agreements may be in place to prevent the cultivation of a crop causing deforestation, they may not work, the study said.In Brazil, for example, under a private-sector led moratorium in place since July 2006, groups representing 90 percent of the soy market committed not to buy soy grown on land cleared of trees in the Amazon rainforest.But soy is still linked to deforestation because cattle pastures have been converted to grow it, displacing beef production to areas where forest loss is occurring, the report said.ADM - which purchases soy but does not farm its own - plans to launch a ""Responsible Soy Standard"" in Brazil on a pilot basis, with a group of growers who will be assessed on their adherence to standards covering labour practices, water and soil usage and observance of land rights, among other things.Some international aid should be used to reform subsidies in a way that safeguards forests, as well as livelihoods and food security, the ODI report urged.""Through subsidy reform, modest sums of forest finance can be used to ensure any subsidies are provided in a manner that both protects forests and the poor,"" the ODI's McFarland said.Incentives could be shifted towards boosting yields or making subsidies conditional on following environmental regulations, as has been done in Brazil with loans to cattle farmers, the report said.

109,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, April 20 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Archer Daniels Midland  Co.'s (ADM) Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A'. The ratings apply to  approximately $5.7 billion of total outstanding debt. The Rating Outlook is  Stable.  See a full list of ratings at the end of this release.  KEY RATING DRIVERS  --EBITDA margin increased significantly to 4.8% in 2014 from 3.4% in 2013  concomitant with a 27% increase in EBITDA as ADM successfully executed upon its  operating strategy. Fitch sees EBITDA margin expanding to more than 5.0% in 2015  with continuation of the current commodity-pricing environment backstopped by  consecutive bumper harvests in South America and North America, integration of  Wild Flavors and Specialty Commodities, and sustained cost reduction efforts. --Gross leverage dropped to 1.46x in 2014 from 2.23x in 2013 as ADM repaid  maturing convertible notes early in the year. ADM demonstrated financial  discipline during 2014 with the use of cash on hand and forgoing long-term  borrowings to fund heavy business development. Fitch sees relatively steady  leverage at the present level over the next two years given no long-term debt  maturities until 2017, and Fitch's expectations that EBITDA will continue to  improve. --Shareholder returns may take precedence in ADM's typically balanced capital  plan this year given a 17% increase in dividends and a publicly stated target of  share repurchases in the range of $1.5 billion to $2 billion. Fitch sees the  heavier shareholder returns as well as increased capital spending as manageable  within expected cash flow generation, coupled with expected proceeds from  near-term business divestments. --ADM has significant sources of internal and external liquidity, arising from  free cash flow (FCF) of $3.4 billion in 2014 as well as access to $6.6 billion  in unused lines of credit at Dec. 31, 2014. The company has no debt due over the  next two years with the next long-term debt maturities being $300 million and  $700 million maturing in 2017 and 2018, respectively.  Profitability Increasing: EBITDA grew almost 27% in 2014 to $3.9 billion as ADM  executes upon its operational strategy, which calls for, to name a few, improved  returns via cost reduction, capital discipline, and portfolio optimization.  Accordingly, EBITDA margin expanded to 4.8% in 2014 from 3.4% in the prior year  with achievement of more than $400 million in cost savings coupled with  divestment of the non-core South American fertilizer business and intention to  sell its underperforming cocoa and chocolate businesses. Fitch sees EBITDA  margin expanding to more than 5.0% in 2015 with continuation of the current  commodity-pricing environment backstopped by consecutive bumper harvests in  South America and North America. In addition, annualization of the recently  acquired value-added ingredients businesses, Wild Flavors and Specialty  Commodities, and continued cost initiatives of $550 million over the next five  years further support margin expansion in the absence of commodity price spikes. Leverage Improvement: Gross leverage dropped to 1.46x at the end of 2014 from  2.23x in 2013 with the payment of convertible notes early in the year. ADM  demonstrated financial discipline during 2014 with the use of cash on hand and  forgoing long-term borrowings to fund heavy business development, notably the  $3.3 billion acquisition of Wild Flavors in December. Fitch sees relatively  steady leverage over the next two years given no long-term debt maturities until  2017, and Fitch's expectations that EBITDA will continue to improve in the  current commodity pricing environment. The expected leverage measure is below  Fitch's comfort level in the 2.0x to 2.5x range; however, ADM remains vulnerable  to often volatile agricultural commodity pricing swings stemming from periodic  supply/demand imbalances that may quickly revert leverage to within the range. Abundant Harvests Sustain Lower Pricing: ADM, along with other agricultural  processors, is subject to variation in commodity pricing affected by a range of  unpredictable macro-environmental conditions, including weather, crop disease  outbreaks, and government agricultural policy changes. Agricultural commodity  pricing has moderated from highs experienced in 2012 due to severe drought, as  seed and grain supplies have increased following consecutive record harvests in  2013 and 2014. With less strain on working capital, FCF increased significantly  to $3.8 billion and $3.4 billion in 2013 and in 2014, respectively, from $631  million for fiscal 2012. Fitch sees adequate FCF, averaging a historical margin  of around 1%, continuing over the next two years, that incorporates the higher  dividend and an increase in capital spending, supported by a beneficial pricing  environment. Balanced Capital Plan: Fitch sees capital deployment balanced between capital  spending and shareholder-friendly activities during 2015. Shareholder returns  may take precedence this year as ADM increased dividends by 17% to achieve a  higher payout ratio, and declared a target of share repurchases in the range of  $1.5 billion to $2 billion. Capital expenditure including value-generating  projects will also rise to between $1.1 billion and $1.3 billion in 2015 to help  drive ADM's operational strategy. These amounts compare to share repurchases of  $1.1 billion and capital spending of $894 million in 2014, when ADM devoted the  majority of its capital to acquisitions. Fitch sees the heavier shareholder  returns and capital spending as manageable within expected cash flow generation,  and expected proceeds from the near-term divestment of the company's cocoa and  chocolate businesses. However, Fitch is concerned about rising dividends in  light of inherently volatile cash flow linked to uncertainties surrounding  commodity pricing. However, a significant increase in contributions from less  susceptible value-added businesses may offset this risk in the long term. RMI Supports Ratings: In addition to evaluating traditional leverage metrics,  Fitch also considers leverage ratios that exclude debt used to finance readily  marketable inventories (RMI). RMI is hedged and very liquid. Including Fitch's  discretionary 10% haircut to reported RMI, RMI adjusted leverage was 0.1x for  fiscal 2014. Since RMI adjusted metrics are generally strong for the rating  level at around 1.0x or below even when the company has stressed operating  earnings and cash flow, Fitch places more emphasis on gross leverage.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Future developments that may individually or collectively, lead to a negative  rating action: --Fitch is comfortable with ADM operating with gross debt leverage in the range  of 2.0x to 2.5x. However, rating pressure will arise if EBITDA compression  and/or a higher debt load leads to sustained unadjusted leverage exceeding 2.5x;  --Sustained lack of FCF generation lasting over two annual crop seasons;  --A material increase in leverage from a significant debt-financed transaction,  most likely a large acquisition. Fitch sees a positive rating action as unlikely over the intermediate term given  ADM's historically high gross debt leverage for the rating category, periodic  negative FCF, and vulnerability to significant periodic supply/demand  imbalances. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Key assumptions within Fitch's rating case for ADM include: --EBITDA margins increasing to more than 5% over the next two years in a  steady-state low pricing environment; --Gross debt leverage remaining consistent with current levels supported by no  long-term debt maturities in 2015 and 2016 and Fitch's expectation for EBITDA  improvement; --Capital spending increasing to a more traditional amount though 2016 after  successive years of capital discipline in 2013 and 2014; --FCF margin around historical levels incorporating a growing dividend and  heavier capital spending; --Share repurchases at the top-end of the publicly stated range in 2015; --Modest acquisition activity focused on manageable, tuck-in purchases.  Fitch affirms ADM's ratings as follows: --Long-term IDR at 'A'; --Senior unsecured bank facility at 'A'; --Senior unsecured notes at 'A'; --Short-term IDR at 'F-1'; --Commercial paper at 'F-1'.

110,"   By Karl Plume | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Archer Daniels Midland Co plans to use drones to gather data on crop insurance claims as soon as the summer of 2016, its risk services head told Reuters on Wednesday.ADM's Crop Risk Services Inc won clearance to use drones earlier this month from the Federal Aviation Administration, which currently bans their commercial use, and will begin testing the technology in the U.S. Midwest this year.The unmanned aircraft can gather data about crop damage from   hail, wind, flooding and drought, and automatically upload the information to the company's claims software, Greg Mills, president of ADM CRS, said in a telephone interview.The company is one of a small number of businesses with agriculture connections, including Monsanto Co's Climate Corp and Trimble Navigation Ltd, that have received exemptions to the FAA's ban on commercial use.The FAA proposed rules on commercial drones in February that limit their use, but final regulations may not be in place for two years. Mills said cost savings from using the drones were likely to be ""significant"" for ADM CRS, but declined to give any detailed estimate.""I think it will create some general efficiencies and some specific efficiencies for claims,"" Mills told Reuters, adding the company already owns two drones and has contracted for another two. The FAA exemption allows ADM CRS to use only Phantom 2 Vision quadcopters made by Shenzhen, China-based Da-Jiang Innovations, which according to the company's website, cost about $900 apiece. ADM CRS would need further FAA approval to fly different aircraft.Drones can be deployed to find and assess multiple areas of crop damage over a broad area. Currently, claims adjusters often have to physically walk out into a field to measure the extent of crop damage, Mills said.""The goal is to test the savings to the business in the Midwest and then potentially release nodes of equipment by next spring to be used for the summer of 2016 for use in a larger area,"" he said. The FAA exemption allows ADM CRS to fly its drones only within 400 feet of the ground and within sight of the operator. Pilots must also have a farmer's permission to fly over their land.Crop insurance is used by farmers to protect their income from losses caused by natural disasters. About 90 percent of planted farmland is covered by insurance every year.

114,"  May 5 Archer Daniels Midland Co, one of the world's largest grain traders, announced on Tuesday a deal to acquire full ownership of two Romanian export terminals on the Black Sea, bolstering its ability to export grain from Eastern Europe.ADM said it has agreed to acquire North Star Shipping and Minmetal, a 50-50 joint venture with North Star, which have grain handling and storage assets at the Port of Constanta. ADM previously held about 45 percent of the companies.The assets include 10 vessel berths, 330,000 tonnes of grain storage capacity, export terminals capable of loading 6 million tonnes annually and two floating cranes to transfer grain to ocean-going vessels from barges. In 2011, ADM bought a network of grain elevators along the Danube River in Romania and it operates six tow boats and 50 barges on the waterway. ""By becoming full owners of these facilities on the Black Sea, we're building on the investments we have made in our Danube River network since 2011, which enhances our origination, logistics and export capabilities in Eastern Europe,"" said Joe Taets, president of ADM Europe Middle East and Africa. ADM did not disclose the terms of the acquisition. The deal is the latest move by ADM to expand its global grain handling network as it works toward a goal of doubling the volume of grain it can originate over the next decade.In February, ADM entered a 50-50 joint venture with commodities trader Glencore in a northern Brazilian port, aiming to quadruple the facility's export capacity to take advantage of rising Brazilian crop production and growing global demand.

115,"  (Adds segment results, revenues)By Karl PlumeCHICAGO May 5 U.S. agribusiness Archer Daniels Midland Co on Tuesday reported higher-than-expected quarterly profit on strong oilseed crushing margins and robust global demand for soybean meal.Revenue, however, fell 15 percent as the strong dollar limited U.S. grain exports, and corn processing profit fell on weak ethanol margins and lower biofuel production volumes.Chicago-based ADM's first-quarter net profit rose to $493 million, or 77 cents per share, from $267 million, or 40 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, earnings increased to 80 cents per share from 64 cents a year ago, topping the average analyst estimate of 71 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Revenue dropped to $17.51 billion from $20.70 billion a year earlier. Analysts, on average, expected revenue of $20.58 billion. ADM's agricultural services business, its largest in terms of revenue, posted a net profit of $194 million, up from $142 million a year earlier. Higher global merchandising volumes and margins boosted results for the unit, which buys, sells, stores and transports grains and other agricultural products.Oilseeds processing profit surged 58 percent to $469 million from $297 million a year earlier on record-large soy crushing volumes in Europe and North America and rising volumes in South America, where farmers are harvesting a bumper crop. Poor ethanol margins and lower production in the quarter dragged down results at ADM's corn processing segment. The unit earned a net $113 million, down 39 percent from $186 million a year earlier.ADM's new ingredients segment's quarterly profit jumped 17 percent to $68 million from $58 million a year earlier.ADM shares closed at a four-month high on Monday.

117,"  CHICAGO May 21 U.S. agribusiness Archer Daniels Midland Co said on Thursday it is expanding grain export capacity at an Argentine port to help boost shipments from the world's No. 3 corn and soybean supplier and top exporter of soymeal and soyoil.The expansion of ADM's Puerto San Martin port terminal in Santa Fe state, to be completed by early 2016, will include a new berth for unloading barges and additional grain storage.""This is a 25 percent increase in our capacity that will allow us to continue to export from Argentina and increase our exports, but also reduce the utilization of ports in Uruguay that are very congested,"" Chief Executive Juan Luciano said at a BMO investor conference in New York. The terminal's capacity will increase from about 2 million tonnes currently to about 2.5 million tonnes, the company said.The investment comes after several recent strategic deals by ADM aimed at increasing the volume of grain and agricultural products it can buy, sell, store and transport around the world. The Chicago-based company has said it wants to double its grain origination over the next decade. ADM entered a 50-50 joint venture with commodities trader Glencore in February to develop a port in northern Brazil in a bid to quadruple the port's capacity to take advantage of expanding crop production in the region.

118,"   By Karl Plume | CHICAGO  CHICAGO The world's largest corn processor, Archer Daniels Midland Co, is shifting focus from its long-standing cash generator ethanol into developing new food ingredients as the biofuel boom that underpinned its financial success has cooled.The shift could be one of the most transformative moves ever made by 113-year-old ADM, triggered by signs of strain in its legacy products. Demand for the gasoline additive ethanol is forecast to remain flat over the next decade while its other mainstay, high fructose corn syrup (HFCS), is beset by health concerns.""Coming up with new products is really what keeps us up at night,"" said Chris Cuddy, president of corn processing.Critics associate HFCS with obesity, and companies including Panera Bread Co and Kraft Foods Group Inc  are cutting it from their goods.ADM's corn business profit dropped 39 percent in the first quarter due to poor ethanol margins. Demand is flattening as government targets for ethanol use in gasoline have been reached and increasingly efficient vehicles consume less fuel. But its ingredients business, currently just a tiny revenue generator for the $31.6 billion company, posted a 17 percent profit jump in the same period.It invested $3 billion in that business last summer with the purchase of natural flavorings company Wild Flavors, ADM's largest-ever acquisition.Analysts say it is too early to tell if the strategy will be successful.""They did deliver a higher return on invested capital in their business last year. Now, it's hard to tell if that's just low corn prices for the ethanol side or whether it's a combination of lower input cost plus better strategy, so it remains to be seen if those returns are sustainable,"" said JP Morgan analyst Ann Duignan.     FLEXIBILITY EQUALS PROFITABILITY ADM has three domestic corn wet mills with the flexibility to make more of what is in demand and profitable and less of what is not.It grinds about 3 million bushels of corn a day worldwide and produces about 11 percent of U.S. ethanol, so even a tiny change can resonate in the commodity supply chain.The mills break corn into the oil-rich germ, high-protein gluten, fiber and the versatile starch which can be processed further with enzymes, yeast or bacteria.At ADM's Decatur, Illinois, plant, the world's largest, computer operators in a tiny, air conditioned control room tucked among towering grain tanks, can tweak output in a couple of key strokes. ""Every day we have to figure out new homes for that starch capacity,"" Cuddy said, holding up for scrutiny one of nine jars, each filled with a different corn byproduct.He said ethanol and corn syrup currently account for over half of the starch but declined to elaborate.Competitors like Cargill Inc [CARG.UL] and Bunge Ltd are also aiming for higher-margin businesses in corn and other crops. Cargill last August opened an expanded food and beverage ingredient research and development facility in Minnesota.THE HUNT FOR RARE SUGAR  Today, half of ADM's research dollars go into finding ways to make food and drinks taste better. Some of its initial forays - such as Fibersol, an odorless, tasteless soluble fiber that helps dieters feel fuller - are slowly gaining traction among the food industry.But it is still seeking the next killer application to transform the market, as ethanol or HFCS did. It hopes to find ""Rare Sugar,"" the proposed name for ""the holy grail of sweeteners"" with all the taste and baking ability of sugar but without the calories.ADM said is has increased research in low-calorie sweeteners since 2010 when it hired a sweetener development expert to lead the effort but would not provide details.More niche products would help ADM deliver more consistent returns by reducing exposure to oil markets through reliance on a gasoline-blending component.In 2008, ADM posted a record quarterly profit after oil roared to an all-time high but turned in its worst performance in five years two quarters later after oil plummeted.Whether the strategy is working is unclear. Analysts say the corn unit's 46-percent profit surge last year was at least partly due to plentiful cheap grain.Either way, Cuddy is confident.""Our customers rely on us so we can't pull in and out of markets to huge degrees. But with the amount of flex we have, given our size, it doesn't take much to influence our bottom line."" (Editing by P.J.

128,"   By Chris Prentice | KANSAS CITY, Kansas  KANSAS CITY, Kansas Archer Daniels Midland Co and ethanol supporters on Thursday challenged a U.S. government plan for biofuels use, saying it will not push past the ""blend wall"" because of a niche market for biofuels credits. Hundreds gathered in Kansas City, Kansas, for a hearing to criticize the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on a proposal for biofuels announced in late May. The hearing comes just weeks after the EPA proposed cutting volumetric use targets below those laid out by Congress in 2007.EPA said its proposal will push, rather than break, through the blend wall, which some say is impossible to get through without major infrastructure changes.It is a key pillar of Big Oil's criticism of the Renewable Fuel Standard program. Companies including Chevron Corp said on Thursday it is reason for reform or repeal.But biofuels supporters said that blend wall may not even be breached with the proposal for next year's use, looking to the niche ethanol compliance credit market for proof. Weak targets and a ""significant carryover"" mean the proposal will not push through that threshold, said Craig Willis, president of ADM's ethanol group, at the hearing. ADM produces some 1.7 billion gallons of the biofuel each year.Refiners will buy the excess supplies, built up over the past year or so, rather than blending greater amounts of fuels.Prices of ethanol Renewable Identification Number (RIN) credits have plunged this month as blenders and traders offloaded them after the EPA unveiled biofuel quotas that were considered easy to each. The hearing offered the first public insight into the arguments that two of the most powerful U.S. sectors will use over the coming months to influence the nation's biofuels policy.For corn farmers and ethanol producers that have plowed billions of dollars into biofuels and created new jobs, the quota is not high enough. Oil companies can blend a gallon of ethanol into gasoline to generate a RIN or buy a credit from another company.  The EPA has underestimated the amount of credits available by 400 million gallons, said Geoff Cooper of the Renewable Fuels Association, a biofuels group.Refiners have complained about high costs of RINs compliance.

133,"  (Adds 2015/16 soy estimate, byline, quotes from Brazil's soy producers' association)By Gustavo BonatoSAO PAULO Aug 3 Archer Daniels Midland Co  expects average profit margins in Brazil's 2015/16 soy production to fall 77 percent from the previous season after two years of falling soybean prices, the company's South America president said on Monday.Valmor Schaffer projected profit margins of 122.20 reais ($35.42) per hectare, down from 539.03 reais in 2014/15, and said average margins would only remain positive because of a weakening Brazilian currency.""This harvest (2015/16), we still have (positive) margins... but not everyone sold soy with the dollar at 3.4 reais,"" Schaffer said at a conference sponsored by Brazil's Agrobusiness Association (Abag) in Sao Paulo.Brazil's currency is 35 percent weaker than it was a year ago and is trading around its lowest in 12 years just as farmers are making final decisions for planting the upcoming 2015/16 crop that will be planted starting in September. A weaker local currency means farmers bring home more reais for each dollar earned for exporting a bag of soybeans, even as the price of the underlying commodity weakens in dollars.But it also means they can pay more for dollar-denominated imports like fertilizers and insecticides, which become more expensive in local currency terms. It particularly hurts farmers who rely on a bartering system in which they buy fertilizers and other inputs in exchange for promising to deliver a portion of the upcoming crop.""The terms of bartering soy for inputs has deteriorated for the producer,"" according to a local farming consultant Clarivi said in a report released on Monday, adding that fertilizer prices have risen 40 percent.The consultant said the terms of trade for a tonne of fertilizer rose to 22.2 60-kg bags of soybeans in 2015/16, from 19.8 bags last crop and 18.56 bags the crop before. Despite falling profit margins, farmers are still expected to increase the area planted with soybeans when they plant the 2015/16 crop starting in September, though less than in recent years. Soybean prices are still more competitive than corn.Local consultancy Celeres estimated on Monday that area would increase 2.3 percent to a record 32.2 million hectares, for a potential record crop of 97 million tonnes, citing a favorable exchange rate and lack of more lucrative planting options.""This is not the time to expand into new area,"" said Almir Dalpasquale, president of Brazil's soy producers' association Aprosoja.

135,"   By Tom Polansek | CHICAGO  CHICAGO U.S. agribusiness group Archer Daniels Midland Co (ADM.N) reported a lower-than-expected quarterly profit on Tuesday following declines in ethanol margins and exports from North America.The Chicago-based grain trader and processor became the second major crop handler to disappoint investors with second- quarter results after rival Bunge Ltd (BG.N) last week posted  sharply lower earnings.Commodity trader Cargill Inc [CARG.UL] is due to report results on Thursday.ADM and Bunge, which make money by trading, transporting, processing and storing crops, have struggled despite massive U.S. harvests last year that increased the volume of available grain.Still, ADM's stock price jumped as much as 3.8 percent on Tuesday on hopes that large upcoming harvests will boost financial results. Shares are down about 6 percent for the year, compared to a 12 percent decline for Bunge shares. ADM expects U.S. exports to improve in the second half of the year as the autumn harvest will weigh on grain prices, Chief Executive Officer Juan Luciano said. Exports have been sluggish because the strong dollar makes U.S. crops expensive compared to grain from other countries, such as Russia.""We expect a very strong second half,"" Luciano told analysts on a conference call.  ADM has been refocusing its operations on grain trading, selling its fertilizer operations in South America last year and striking deals to sell its cocoa and chocolate businesses. Merchandising and handling earnings in quarter slumped 64 percent to $41 million in the quarter as robust exports from South America reduced margins and volumes of exports from North America, the company said.    Net earnings dropped to $386 million, or 62 cents per share, from $533 million, or 81 cents per share, a year earlier. Adjusted earnings declined to 60 cents per share from 79 cents a year ago, missing the average analyst estimate of 66 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Profits for bioproducts, such as corn-based ethanol, slid 70 percent to $43 million in the quarter as record-large industry ethanol production reduced margins from a year ago.

136,"  (Adds details from conference call, stock price)By Tom PolansekCHICAGO Aug 4 U.S. agribusiness group Archer Daniels Midland Co reported a lower-than-expected quarterly profit on Tuesday following declines in ethanol margins and exports from North America.The Chicago-based grain trader and processor became the second major crop handler to disappoint investors with second- quarter results after rival Bunge Ltd last week posted  sharply lower earnings.Commodity trader Cargill Inc is due to report results on Thursday.ADM and Bunge, which make money by trading, transporting, processing and storing crops, have struggled despite massive U.S. harvests last year that increased the volume of available grain. Still, ADM's stock price jumped as much as 3.8 percent on Tuesday on hopes that large upcoming harvests will boost financial results. Shares are down about 6 percent for the year, compared to a 12 percent decline for Bunge shares.ADM expects U.S. exports to improve in the second half of the year as the autumn harvest will weigh on grain prices, Chief Executive Officer Juan Luciano said. Exports have been sluggish because the strong dollar makes U.S. crops expensive compared to grain from other countries, such as Russia.""We expect a very strong second half,"" Luciano told analysts on a conference call. ADM has been refocusing its operations on grain trading, selling its fertilizer operations in South America last year and striking deals to sell its cocoa and chocolate businesses.Merchandising and handling earnings in quarter slumped 64 percent to $41 million in the quarter as robust exports from South America reduced margins and volumes of exports from North America, the company said. Net earnings dropped to $386 million, or 62 cents per share, from $533 million, or 81 cents per share, a year earlier. Adjusted earnings declined to 60 cents per share from 79 cents a year ago, missing the average analyst estimate of 66 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Profits for bioproducts, such as corn-based ethanol, slid 70 percent to $43 million in the quarter as record-large industry ethanol production reduced margins from a year ago.ADM would have to pull off ""a pretty heroic recovery"" to bounce back from weak results in the first half of the year, said Robert Moskow, an analyst at Credit Suisse.""It just looks like the year as a whole is going to be below what your internal expectations might have been,"" he told Luciano on the call.The stock was up 2.4 percent at $48.84 at midday.

Those represent increases of 15 percent or more from pricing for noncontracted business as of Aug. 31, 2015, quoted in its letter.

143,"  * More than 6,500 tonnes of rice in dispute* Court imposes jail terms of up to 18 monthsBy David BroughLONDON, Aug 13 London's High Court has issued an arrest order against the owner and a senior officer of a Nicaraguan grains business for failing to pay millions of dollars owed to commodities house Archer Daniels Midland  for rice imports, ADM and court papers said.The case highlights a trend in which falling commodity prices have led to an increase in requests through courts for worldwide asset-freezing orders against companies that have not met the terms of their sales contracts.Some lawyers in London say applying for such orders from the English High Court has become more common as commodities companies, among others, use this mechanism as a key weapon in a creditor's armoury against defaulting counterparties.A dozen worldwide freezing order and contempt cases have been heard by the London High Court over the last couple of years, these lawyers say. In the ADM case, over 6,500 metric tonnes of U.S.-origin rice was shipped to the importer, Corcosa - Corporacion Comercializadora de Granos Basicos, in 2011 and 2012, under six sale contracts in dispute.Each of those contracts is governed by English law and subject to arbitration by London-based GAFTA - the Grain and Feed Trade Association.ADM spokeswoman Jackie Anderson said, ""On July 21, ADM and its subsidiary ADM Rice, Inc. obtained sanctions from the UK High Court in London against a Nicaraguan company named Corporación Comercializadora de Granos Básicos (""Corcosa""); its owner and president, Enrique Jose Delgadillo Aguirre; and Mr. Delgadillo's daughter and the executive director of the company, Vanessa Auxiliadora Delgadillo Sacasa."" The court imposed prison sentences of up to 18 months on Enrique and Vanessa Delgadillo after it found they had disregarded its orders, Anderson said.The move followed a 2014 arbitration award in which the GAFTA Tribunal in London determined that Corcosa and the Delgadillos had misappropriated $2.5 million in rice shipped to Nicaragua by ADM, lawyers close to the case said.Court papers seen by Reuters confirmed the sanctions against Enrique and Vanessa Delgadillo. A source close to ADM said Corcosa had not engaged with the court so no defence was filed. Reuters could not independently confirm this.Reuters visited Corcosa's registered address in Managua but was unable to locate the family. Attempts by Reuters to contact lawyers for Corcosa and Enrique and Vanessa Delgadillo were unsuccessful.Nicaragua's Chamber of Commerce said its files on the company had not been updated for two years, and that it did not know whether Corcosa remained in business.Previously, Corcosa had paid for rice it received from ADM.ADM is studying options for executing the arrest warrants in Britain, the United States or other countries, and for seizing assets belonging to Corcosa or the Delgadillo family, Anderson said.Christopher Swart of Holman Fenwick Willan, ADM's lawyers, called the case ""another example of the English courts' willingness to engage in international disputes where a link to this jurisdiction can be established"".

145,"   By Karl Plume | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Oct 7 A 20 percent quarterly profit jump for global grains trader Cargill Inc suggests recent disappointing quarterly earnings from rival agribusinesses Archer Daniels Midland Co and Bunge Ltd  may be more of a blip than long- term concern, analysts said.Cargill's strong results, reported on Wednesday, seem to indicate surprising strength for traders of agricultural commodities, as compared to those exposed to industrial and precious metals which have fallen sharply and rattled Glencore Plc and Noble Group.Privately held Cargill navigated sinking crop prices, volatile currencies and slowing growth in top grains importer China to turn in a net $512 million profit in its fiscal first quarter, bouncing back from a $51 million loss due to one-time charges in the prior quarter.The core businesses of companies like ADM, Bunge and Cargill make money by buying, selling, transporting, storing and processing grains and oilseeds. Margins are typically thin, but volumes are massive when crop supplies are ample - and prices low - as they currently are.""Historically, the way a commodity firm gets in trouble is when they get too far away from that model. ... That does take some discipline and that's something that Cargill has learned exceedingly well,"" said Scott Irwin, an agricultural economist at the University of Illinois. U.S. farmers are currently harvesting among their largest-ever corn and soybean crops, adding to already record-high global stocks.Meanwhile, farmers in South American grains powerhouse Brazil have been actively marketing crops as their real currency has plunged to around 13-year lows against the dollar. Sales of the crops are typically made in dollars, meaning that farmers realize greater earnings for their crops when the currency weakens against the dollar.""For the last two years, farmers have held on to their crops in the third (calendar) quarter so results were weaker for all these companies,"" said John Rogers, a senior vice president and team leader for chemicals and commodities at Moody's. ""This year, because crop prices are down and stocks-to-use ratios are pretty high, there's not much hope for further price increases through next year, so there's more opportunity for these companies to make money.""Disappointing results for ADM and Bunge in their most recent quarters were blamed on turbulent global markets. An unexpected spike in crop prices late in their quarter also negatively skewed results as inventories were temporarily valued at higher prices, making margins on sales seem tighter. In comparison, Cargill's most recent fiscal quarter ended on Aug. 31, allowing the company favorable comparisons with losses that arose from an unexpected surge in crop prices in late June, Rogers said.Analysts at BMO Capital Markets and Credit Suisse upgraded Bunge to ""outperform"" last week on expectations that a weak Brazilian real swelled supplies of soybeans available to the company for processing and helped boost the export of Brazilian soybeans.Analysts also expected ADM to benefit from the weaker real and bumper crops in the United States, home to most of its assets, although weak margins in ethanol biofuel could partly offset gains.ADM is to report its quarterly results on Nov. 3. Bunge has not yet announced a reporting date.ADM shares hit a one-month high on Wednesday and Bunge shares rallied to a two-month peak, though both are down about 15 percent on the year.

(ADM.N) in a deal valued at $1.2 billion, the companies said on Friday.The deal, first announced in December last year, catapults the Singapore-based commodities firm into the top tier of global suppliers to the chocolate business.It boosts Olam's processing capacity to about 700,000 tonnes, behind only Barry Callebaut (BARN.S) and Cargill Inc. with operations in major producing countries Ivory Coast, Nigeria, Ghana and Brazil as well as coming markets in Europe, the United States, Canada and Asia.The combined entity will be looking to source from around 850,000 tonnes to 900,000 tonnes annually, Gerry Manley, Olam’s head of cocoa said.""We want to be really focused on the cocoa products market and supplying the chocolate industry, cocoa powder users, and really not set ourselves up in competition to chocolate manufacturers,"" Manley said. ""Most importantly of all for us from a producing country point of view and indeed a consuming country point of view, we get Brazil. It’s the largest producing country where Olam has not been involved before.""Manley said Olam was also looking at increasing its interest in the Japanese market. Japanese trading house Mitsubishi Corp (8058.T) bought a 20 percent stake in Olam in August.""Clearly in the joint venture Mitsubishi are looking to see how they can increase the links with Olam in Japan and indeed understand more about the various agricultural businesses that we’re involved with,"" he said.Olam's cocoa business will continue to be headquartered in London although the company has opened a new office outside of Geneva where the Switzerland-based staff from ADM will be relocating. Olam said the acquisition was expected to be earnings, returns and cash flow accretive in the first full year of consolidation.The company said the acquired business was expected to generate earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of between $180 million and $200 million including synergies in 2018.

148,"   By Karl Plume | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Shares of Archer Daniels Midland Co (ADM.N) tumbled more than 8 percent on Tuesday after the agribusiness group reported a lower third-quarter profit due to weak ethanol margins and slumping North American grain exports.The decrease in profit, below Wall Street's expectations, came despite rising global demand for food and ample global supplies of corn, soybeans and other crops following massive harvests in North and South America and other key production areas around the globe.Chicago-based ADM, one of the world's top producers of corn-based ethanol, said earnings in its corn processing unit tumbled 62 percent due to thin margins and high inventories of the biofuel.Oilseeds processing profit fell 21 percent in the quarter while earnings at its agricultural services, ADM's largest segment in terms of revenue, dipped 3 percent. The core businesses of ADM and its rivals Bunge Ltd (BG.N) and Cargill Inc [CARG.UL] buy, sell, transport, store and process grains and oilseeds. Margins are typically thin, but volumes are massive when crop supplies are good and prices are low, as they currently are.Lighter-than-normal grain sales by U.S. farmers have hurt ADM this season, Chief Executive Juan Luciano said. To date, U.S. growers have sold only about 30 percent of the latest corn crop and 35 percent of their soybean crop, compared with 45 and 60 percent normally, he said.Meanwhile, a strong U.S. dollar made crop exports from the United States less competitive on the world market and also raised the cost of the dollar-denominated raw materials that ADM buys and processes in other countries. A weak Brazilian real triggered active farmer selling in that country, flooding the global market with cheaper supplies. ""ADM shares are weak, reflecting the third quarter earnings miss as well as anticipation that fourth-quarter results will continue to be hampered by slow farmer selling, weak export demand for U.S. grain and lackluster ethanol profitability,"" said Farha Aslam, an analyst with Stephens Inc.ADM said that net third-quarter profit tumbled to $252 million, or 41 cents per share, from $747 million, or $1.14 per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, earnings fell to 60 cents per share from 86 cents a year ago. Analysts expected 70 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Shares of ADM were down 8.4 percent at $42.39 on Tuesday and are off nearly 19 percent from the beginning of the year.

Oilseeds processing profit fell 21 percent in the quarter while earnings at its agricultural services, ADM's largest segment in terms of revenue, dipped 3 percent.The core businesses of ADM and its rivals Bunge Ltd  and Cargill Inc buy, sell, transport, store and process grains and oilseeds. Margins are typically thin, but volumes are massive when crop supplies are good and prices are low, as they currently are. Lighter-than-normal grain sales by U.S. farmers have hurt ADM this season, Chief Executive Juan Luciano said. To date, U.S. growers have sold only about 30 percent of the latest corn crop and 35 percent of their soybean crop, compared with 45 and 60 percent normally, he said.Meanwhile, a strong U.S. dollar made crop exports from the United States less competitive on the world market and also raised the cost of the dollar-denominated raw materials that ADM buys and processes in other countries. A weak Brazilian real triggered active farmer selling in that country, flooding the global market with cheaper supplies. ""ADM shares are weak, reflecting the third quarter earnings miss as well as anticipation that fourth-quarter results will continue to be hampered by slow farmer selling, weak export demand for U.S. grain and lackluster ethanol profitability,"" said Farha Aslam, an analyst with Stephens Inc.ADM said that net third-quarter profit tumbled to $252 million, or 41 cents per share, from $747 million, or $1.14 per share, a year earlier.Excluding one-time items, earnings fell to 60 cents per share from 86 cents a year ago. Analysts expected 70 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Shares of ADM were down 8.4 percent at $42.39 on Tuesday and are off nearly 19 percent from the beginning of the year.

152,"   By Dan Levine  Nov 4 Big sugar processors are set to take on major corn refiners including Archer Daniels Midland Co  and Cargill Inc before a U.S. jury on Wednesday in a billion-dollar lawsuit that could shape how consumers view two bitter foes in the sweetener market.Several sugar refiners including global leader ASR Group sued in 2011, alleging that a corn trade group's ad campaign describing high fructose corn syrup as ""corn sugar"" and ""natural"" was false. The corn refiners countersued, saying the Sugar Association falsely claimed in its newsletter that corn syrup causes obesity and cancer.The case, which is scheduled for opening statements on Wednesday in federal court in Los Angeles, comes amid a decline in sweetener demand. The U.S. slowdown is due in part to concerns about high rates of obesity and diabetes.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2012 ruled that corn syrup, used to sweeten foods including soda, could not be called sugar. The sugar growers are seeking $1.1 billion in compensatory damages over the prior advertising campaign, plus punitive damages and fees, their attorney W. Mark Lanier said. The corn refiners are seeking about $530 million in their countersuit.Asked if a negative verdict would materially impact ADM, spokesman David Weintraub said the company has ""ample flexibility to handle any range of situations"" with access to $6.4 billion of short-term liquidity. The sugar processors in their lawsuit argue that corn syrup is a man-made product composed almost entirely of dextrose, while sugar is natural sucrose found in cane and beet plants.Corn refiners launched an advertising campaign in 2008 calling syrup ""corn sugar,"" and saying it is natural and ""nutritionally the same as table sugar."" The sugar processors' lawsuit said those statements are false. In their countersuit, ADM and corn refiners said that sugar and corn syrup are nutritionally equivalent.""The Sugar Association preys on consumers' fears by falsely representing that HFCS will cause obesity, cancer, and cirrhosis of the liver,"" the counterclaim said, ""while at the same time creating a health halo for processed sugar.""Corn refiners say sugar growers benefit from generous U.S. government subsidies. The Corn Refiners Association, one of the defendants, said earlier this year it had hired a Washington lobbyist to challenge sugar's protected status.The trial is expected to last about three weeks.

The corn refiners countersued, saying the Sugar Association falsely claimed in its newsletter that corn syrup causes obesity and cancer. The case comes amid a decline in sweetener demand.

An attorney from the sugar group did not ask how much of that came from ADM. Cuddy also was asked about an internal corn association email that outlined the ad campaign.

154,"  (Adds quote from attorney for sugar companies)By Dan LevineNov 20 Major sugar companies and corn refiners, including Archer Daniels Midland Co, have settled high stakes litigation that probed the health claims of each industry amid falling demand for sweeteners.Terms of the settlement, which was reached in the middle of trial, were not disclosed in a joint statement on Friday.""The parties had been trying to work on an agreement for a month before trial, and these things take time,"" W. Mark Lanier, an attorney for the sugar processors, told Reuters.A representative for corn refiners declined to comment. Several sugar refiners including global leader ASR Group alleged in a 2011 lawsuit that a Corn Refiners Association advertising campaign describing high fructose corn syrup as ""corn sugar"" and ""natural"" was false. The corn refiners countersued, saying the Sugar Association falsely said in its newsletter that corn syrup caused obesity and cancer.Trial began earlier this month, and had been expected to be decided by jury in December. While the implications for the companies are unclear, the settlement means consumers will not receive an impartial verdict about which industry's health claims are more accurate. The case came amid an overall decline in sweetener demand, particularly of corn syrup. The U.S. slowdown is due in part to concerns about high rates of obesity and diabetes.Corn refiners argued that sugar processors were not damaged because they enjoyed record sales and profits during the ad campaign. The sugar growers sought $1.1 billion in compensatory damages over the campaign. The corn refiners asked for about $530 million in their countersuit.The case involved voluminous scientific evidence and heated arguments from both sides, but a joint statement on Friday was neutral about which product is healthier. Both industries ""continue their commitments to practices that encourage safe and healthful use of their products, including moderation in the consumption of table sugar, high fructose corn syrup and other sweeteners,"" the parties said.In 1999, the average American consumed 85.3 lb of corn sweeteners per year, compared with 66.4 lb of sugar, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data. However, by 2014 corn sweetener consumption had dropped to 60.7 lb, while sugar consumption stood at 68.4 lb.Overall, the average American consumed 131.1 lb of sweetener in 2014, down from 153.2 lb in 1999.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2012 ruled that corn syrup, used to sweeten foods including soda, could not be called sugar.

158,"   By Tracy Rucinski  and P.J. Huffstutter | CHICAGO  CHICAGO With agricultural lenders fearing a tidal wave of farm bankruptcies as soon as this spring, lawyers in the Midwest say they want U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa to raise the debt limit for so-called ""family farmer"" bankruptcies.Farmers in states like Illinois, Indiana and Iowa are scrambling to secure lending for the 2016 growing season at a time when prices for their corn have halved from three years ago.Many younger farmers, who tend to be more cash poor than their elders, are expected to be among the hardest hit by stubbornly high input costs such as fertilizer and seeds and souring export sales.As they seek restructuring advice, many are told their debts surpass the $4 million limit for a Chapter 12 family farm bankruptcy, said at least five lawyers who represent either debtors or creditors.They say the $4 million cap is out of touch with most farms' current operating size, often thousands of acres of land paid for by expensive leases and worked using tractors that can cost more than $250,000. ""The debt limit for Chapter 12 bankruptcies should be raised to at least $10 million,"" said Joseph Peiffer, a bankruptcy attorney in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.Chapter 12 was created during the 1980s farm crisis as a simple court procedure to let farmers keep operating while working out a plan to repay lenders. Without a new limit, farmers would be forced into a Chapter 11 filing, which is more costly and onerous.Peiffer has presented his proposal to Grassley, who also heads the Senate Judiciary Committee which oversees bankruptcy law.Grassley's office said the senator had seen a proposal to raise the Chapter 12 debt limit and was still gathering information. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has estimated that net farm income plummeted in 2015 to $55.9 billion, down nearly 55 percent from an all-time high in 2013. The final data is set for release next month.The USDA has also forecast that the data will show farmers' debt-to-asset ratio grew to 12.8 in 2015 from 11.3 in 2013.Last spring, some farmers took the extreme step of breaching their lease contracts, reducing how much land they will sow this spring and risking years-long legal battles with landlords.Since then, leading players in the agricultural sector have seen their businesses hurt by lower farm income and grain prices. These include tractor maker Deere & Co, seeds and chemical leader Monsanto Co. and top grain buyer Archer Daniels Midland Co.",2016-01-16,ADM,"Fri Jan 15, 2016 | 7:13pm EST","Fearing wave of bankruptcies, U.S. corn belt wants new debt cap",http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-agriculture-bankruptcy-idUSL2N15000G?type=companyNews

163,"   By Chris Prentice, Michael Hirtzer and Karl Plume | NEW YORK/CHICAGO  NEW YORK/CHICAGO When Archer Daniels Midland opened two of the country's largest ethanol plants in Nebraska and Iowa six years ago, the biofuels market was on the cusp of a boom with prices and profits on the rise.Now, the plants are more of a headache for the Chicago-based company, considered an industry pioneer, amid crushed margins and weak prices as the financial success of its almost 40-year- old business fades.In the industry's first major capitulation to depressed market conditions, ADM's chief executive, Juan Luciano, on Tuesday said he would consider options, including a sale, for those two plants as well as another in Peoria, Illinois. The three dry-mill ethanol plants, some of the largest in the country, represent just under half of ADM's 1.8-billion-gallon-per-year U.S. ethanol capacity.The news came as ADM blamed weaker-than-expected quarterly profits on poor ethanol margins and depressed U.S. grain exports, sending its shares tumbling almost 9 percent for their worst day in 6-1/2 years.The review also comes as the 114-year-old company continues to shift its focus on developing new food ingredients as domestic demand for gasoline additive ethanol is forecast to remain flat over the next decade. Still, the fact that the country's biggest ethanol producer and a mainstay of the U.S. industry is considering options like a partnership or sale of some of its previously prized assets caught many industry experts by surprise, because ethanol prices have been withstanding the broader commodities rout in recent days.But it may point to a gloomy long-term outlook for energy prices.""Maybe they see it as a boom time that's ending,"" said Scott Irwin, an economist with the University of Illinois.ADM is not alone as sinking ethanol prices and relatively stable corn prices squeeze margins and as crude oil prices tumbled to their lowest level in over a decade.  Last week, Valero Energy Corp, one of the largest U.S. producers, reported a 76 percent plunge in income from its ethanol business in the final four months of last year.Ethanol margins have been under pressure, below break-even, as prices hold around $1.43 per gallon. WET VS DRY Divesting from the dry mills would leave the company with five wet mills, which experts say are more flexible and potentially a savvy way of navigating the torrid market conditions. The five wet mills are able to churn out multiple products, including higher margin ones, like corn syrup, made from the same corn starch that produces ethanol.Most of the country's production comes from dry mills, which crush corn into ethanol and distillers' grains for animal feed. They tend to be more efficient ethanol producers than wet mills, but do not offer as much flexibility. The industry has undergone multiple busts in just over a decade, plagued by controversy over the country's renewable fuel standard, which requires use of ethanol in gasoline.ALMOST 40 YEARS  Selling or finding partners for the plants would be a major overhaul of ADM's ethanol business since it started production at its first mill in Decatur, Illinois.

181,"  (Adds details on global trading desk's quarterly loss, CEO comments)By Tom Polansek and Arunima BanerjeeMay 3 Sharp moves in crop prices caught Archer Daniels Midland Co wrong footed in the first quarter, leaving its global trading team with a loss and contributing to a 53 percent decline in profit, its chief executive officer said on Tuesday.""Our positions were not immune to the end of the quarter movements,"" CEO Juan Luciano told analysts on a conference call.Weak U.S. grain exports also hurt earnings and revenue at Chicago-based ADM, one of the world's top agricultural trading houses, as crop handlers coped with a global glut of supply.The trading desk's loss in the quarter ended on March 31 was a swing from positive results a year earlier, indicating how price swings jolted even the biggest dealers. ADM makes money by buying, selling, transporting, storing and processing grains and oilseeds around the world. The company, Bunge Ltd, Cargill Inc and Louis Dreyfus Corp make up the so-called ABCD firms that have traditionally dominated the flow of agricultural commodities.Net income attributable to ADM fell to $230 million, or 39 cents per share, in the quarter, from $493 million, or 77 cents per share, a year earlier. On an adjusted basis, the company earned 42 cents per share, below analysts' expectations for 45 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue fell 18 percent to $14.38 billion.ADM said ""unfavorable merchandising positions"" contributed to its trading team's loss but did not specify what the positions were.It linked the loss to price moves at the end of March, a month in which U.S. soybean futures jumped 6.8 percent as poor weather threatened to limit crop exports from South America. On March 31, corn futures dropped more than 4 percent, erasing gains built over the rest of the month. Luciano said he was ""cautiously optimistic"" that reduced South American soybean and corn production could shift export business to the United States in the second half of the year. That would benefit ADM, as many of its assets are in the country.Still, the biggest impact of such a shift would not take place until after U.S. farmers harvest their next crops in the autumn, he said.Second-quarter results in ADM's agricultural services unit, which includes exporting and trading operations, will likely be similar to those in the first quarter, when operating profits fell 61 percent from a year earlier to about $75 million, Luciano said.ADM shares were down 2 percent at $39.40.

185,"   By Tom Polansek and Karl Plume  Across the U.S. Farm Belt, top grain handlers have banned genetically modified crops that are not approved in all major overseas markets, shaking up a decades-old system that used the world's biggest exporting country as a launchpad for new seeds from companies like Monsanto Co.Bold yellow signs from global trader Bunge Ltd are posted at U.S. grain elevators barring 19 varieties of GMO corn and soybeans that lack approval in important markets.CHS Inc, the country's largest farm cooperative, wants companies to keep seeds with new biotech traits off the market until they have full approval from major foreign buyers, Gary Anderson, a senior vice president for CHS, told Reuters.""I think that would be the safest thing for the supply chain,"" he said. CHS implemented a policy last year under which it will not sell seeds or buy grain that contains traits lacking approvals needed for export.The U.S. farm sector is trying to avoid a repeat of the turmoil that occurred in 2013 and 2014, when China turned away boatloads of U.S. corn containing a Syngenta AG trait called Viptera that it had not approved. Viptera corn was engineered to control insects.Cargill Inc and Archer Daniels Midland Co  each said the rejections cost them millions of dollars, and both companies have sued Syngenta for damages. ADM is refusing GMO crops that lack global approval. Cargill did not respond to requests for comment.The United States is the biggest producer of GMO crops and has long been at the forefront of technology aiming to protect crops against insects or allow them to resist herbicides.That innovation is now seen as a risk to trade because it is hard to segregate crops containing unapproved traits from the billions of identical-looking bushels exported every year. Soren Schroder, chief executive officer for Bunge, said the practice of launching GMO seeds without full approval is ""very risky.""""It's an uncomfortable position for the industry when there are traits out there that haven't had major market approval,"" he said in an interview.The latest crop being banned is Monsanto's Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybean, whose seeds are genetically engineered to resist the herbicides glyphosate and dicamba. It is being sold for the first time in the United States and Canada this year despite lacking clearance from the European Union, an important export market for North American soybeans.Monsanto said it expects EU approval soon. It initially projected farmers would plant the seed on 3 million acres in the United States, roughly 4 percent of overall plantings, and 420,000 acres in Canada. Plantings have already begun in North America, and Monsanto spokeswoman Trish Jordan said that each passing week without EU authorization lowers the forecast for acreage in Canada.The company is allowing growers to switch to another variety and has not yet shipped Xtend seeds to farmers who have ordered it in Canada. Monsanto has not publicly lowered its U.S. forecast.ADM, Bunge and CHS have said they will not accept Xtend soybeans until the trait is fully approved by major markets. Bunge also declined to accept Viptera corn before China cleared it in December 2014.The company's list of banned traits on its yellow posters contains products from Monsanto, Syngenta, Dow AgroSciences, Stine Seeds, DuPont Pioneer and Bayer, many of which are not commercially available to farmers yet. CHS has its own list of restricted traits that includes products from Monsanto, Syngenta and DuPont Pioneer.Seed companies, including Syngenta and Dow, are addressing industry concerns by selling biotech products under programs that restrict where growers can deliver their harvests to keep crops out of unapproved markets.Farmers also produce crops containing biotech traits from Monsanto and DuPont Pioneer under contracts with end users that designate approved locations where they can be delivered.However, such approaches are not fool-proof methods of protecting the supply chain, Anderson said.Stine Seed and Bayer said they have policies against selling seed traits that lack approvals in major export markets.Bayer this week seized on concerns about Monsanto's launch of Xtend soybeans to promote its own brand, LibertyLink.""Soybeans, once considered such a simple crop to grow and market, is becoming more complicated,"" Bayer said. It called the situation faced by growers ""downright confusing.""(Additional reporting by Rod Nickel in Winnipeg)",2016-05-06,ADM,"Fri May 6, 2016 | 5:13pm EDT",U.S. traders reject GMO crops that lack global approval,http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-gmo-crops-idUSL2N18323B?type=companyNews

199,"   By Colin Packham | SYDNEY  SYDNEY Shares in GrainCorp fell as much 7 percent on Wednesday after its largest shareholder, Archer Daniels Midland Co, failed to find a buyer to sell its 20 percent stake in Australia's largest listed bulk grain hander.ADM was shopping its stake in GrainCorp, but after muted interest the U.S. agribusiness giant canceled the sale process, two sources familiar with the matter said.Lazard was advising on the sale, but a buyer could not be found for the entire stake and interested parties were only keen to buy at around A$8 ($6.00) per share, the sources said.One of the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said after being contacted about a possible sale, while there could have been upside, there was also a risk ""we could have lost millions"" if the deal went wrong.  Shares in GrainCorp last traded at A$8.12 by 0535 GMT, down around 6 percent.  An ADM spokesperson did not confirm the attempted sale but said: ""We regularly review our business portfolio and consider a wide range of strategic opportunities to determine how best to maximize shareholder returns. There can be no assurance these discussions will result in a transaction.""GrainCorp Chief Executive Mark Palmquist was quoted by the Australia Broadcasting Corporation as saying he had not spoken to ADM about its plans and did not want to speculate.ADM's attempt to sell out of GrainCorp comes nearly three years after its A$2.8 billion bid was rejected by Australia's government, citing national interest concerns. GrainCorp has been hit by prolonged drought in parts of Australia's east coast, curbing grain production and revenues for storing gain on behalf of farmers and from trading.The bulk grain handler in May said underlying net profit for the first half was A$32 million, down from A$35 million a year earlier and with full-year forecasts of A$40 million-A$55 million.Should profit come in at the bottom end of the forecast, it would be GrainCorp's lowest earnings since 2008. Australia is the world's fourth-largest exporter of wheat, but after three years of dry weather the country's competitiveness in the global market has waned.Australia's chief commodity forecaster last month raised its forecast for wheat production in the 2016/17 season to a four-year high of 25.4 million tonnes.But with plentiful global supplies, Australian wheat exporters are losing market share to cheaper sellers, particularly from the Black Sea region.

The once lucrative business has seen U.S. ethanol demand plateau and inventories rise, while significant export market growth remains uncertain.ADM's second-quarter earnings fell short of analysts' expectations as volatile grain prices and weak trading and processing margins, including for ethanol, dragged down results. But ADM forecast improved market conditions in the second half of 2016 as U.S. farmers are expected to harvest bumper corn and soybean crops this fall, which should boost margins and exports from the United States.""The first half of the year was very challenging. However, with improved fundamentals, we anticipate a more favorable second half of the year,"" Chief Executive Juan Luciano said.Still, ADM warned that losses at Singapore-based vegetable oils processor Wilmar International Ltd (WLIL.SI), in which ADM holds a 22 percent stake, would result in $50 million in equity losses in the third quarter. The losses will reduce ADM earnings by 17 cents a share, said CFO Ray Young.ADM makes money by buying, selling, transporting, storing and processing grains and oilseeds around the world.The company, along with rivals Bunge Ltd (BG.N), Cargill Inc [CARG.UL] and Louis Dreyfus Corp LOUDR.UL, makes up the so-called ABCD firms that have traditionally dominated the flow of agricultural commodities. Net earnings attributable to ADM fell to $284 million, or 48 cents per share, for the quarter ended June 30 from $386 million, or 62 cents per share, a year earlier.Excluding items, profit was 41 cents per share, below the average analyst estimate of 45 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.ADM shares fell about 2.6 percent to $43.07.

The company is looking to sell or find a partner for the assets amid frustration over a persistent oversupply in the market that has thinned margins for making the biofuel.Results in the oilseeds processing business were dragged down by weak soy processing margins, reduced South American crop supplies and a steep quarterly loss at Wilmar International Ltd (WLIL.SI).

214,"   By Karl Plume | CHICAGO  CHICAGO U.S. agricultural commodities trader Archer Daniels Midland Co (ADM.N) has sold its 19.9 percent stake in GrainCorp Ltd (GNC.AX) to underwriters UBS just three years after a failed bid to wholly acquire the Australian grain handler, ADM said on Thursday.The sale to the Swiss bank was valued at A$387 million  ($286.92 million), or A$8.53 a share, ADM said.ADM's A$2.8 billion bid to buy Australia's largest listed grain handler was blocked by government regulators in 2013 near the peak of a grain market boom. Commodities prices have since tumbled and ADM and rival agribusinesses are focusing increasingly on higher-margin businesses such as natural food ingredients and specialty commodities to boost slumping returns.""This transaction will allow us to further reduce our invested capital, and it will provide cash that we can redeploy to higher-return investments,"" ADM Chief Executive Officer Juan Luciano said in a statement. ADM had been shopping its GrainCorp stake this year, but was unable to find a buyer for the entire stake and canceled the sale process in July 2016, sources said.ADM shares were up about 2.5 percent on Thursday at $44.31, up nearly 21 percent since the beginning of 2016. GrainCorp shares drifted lower to A$8.71 in early trading on the Australian Stock Exchange on Friday, up less than 1 percent on the year.
