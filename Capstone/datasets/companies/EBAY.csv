0,"  * Britain seen with biggest online trade surplus of $1 bln* eBay, Amazon, Zalando, ASOS leaders at pure e-commerce* Sweden's IKEA, H&M exploiting online to grow fasterBERLIN, Jan 20 The value of online exports in six of the top e-commerce markets will grow fivefold to $130 billion by 2020, with Britain currently generating the biggest online trade surplus by selling more goods abroad, research showed on Monday.The study by London-based management consultancy OC&C and U.S. search engine Google estimated the value of cross-border online trade in the United States, Britain, Germany, the Nordics, the Netherlands and France at $25 billion for 2013. E-commerce is expanding at breakneck pace, with online retail sales in Europe seen doubling by 2018 to 323 billion euros ($437.91 billion), market research firm Mintel forecasts.""Over the next decade, online retail will become even more international. This represents a great opportunity for retailers by providing a new, capital-light approach to grow rapidly,""  OC&C partner Anita Balchandani said in a statement. Britain, the most advanced e-commerce market in the world, generated the biggest online trade surplus in 2013 of more than $1 billion, OC&C estimated, followed by the United States with a surplus of $180 million and Germany on $35 million.While OC&C said U.S. online pioneers eBay and Amazon were the top international players in pure e-commerce, German online fashion retailer Zalando and British rival ASOS were next in their ranking. ASOS said on Jan. 14 that retail sales rose 38 percent to 335.7 million pounds in the four months to Dec. 31, helped by a jump of 69 percent in Europe even as growth in the United States and Australia slowed.Swedish furniture retailer IKEA topped the OC&C ranking of traditional players using e-commerce to speed their international expansion, followed by fashion retailer H&M  and U.S. cosmetics seller Avon Products Inc.German sportswear maker Adidas led the OC&C ranking of brands which have used e-commerce to build their international standing, followed by France's Louis Vuitton  and Hermes, and Britain's Burberry.",2014-01-20,EBAY,"Mon Jan 20, 2014 | 6:29am EST",Online cross-border trade seen growing fivefold by 2020-study,http://www.reuters.com//article/retail-online-idUSL5N0KU1BY20140120?type=companyNews

The results followed disappointments from Verizon, Travelers and Johnson & Johnson, which weighed on the blue-chip index on Tuesday.IBM's decline offset modest gains from fellow component United Technologies Corp, which rose 1 percent to $116.12 after it reported fourth-quarter earnings that topped Wall Street estimates, although revenue was shy of expectations.""We've seen significant decreases in a company's ability to deliver on earnings this quarter ... however, we've also seen signs that the top-line growth we've been looking for is starting to emerge,"" said Kristina Hooper, head of portfolio strategies at Allianz Global Investors in New York.""Seeing a broad-based top-line growth trend would really speak to the health of the economy ... that's allowed for the market to hang in there despite some disappointments."" With 16 percent of the S&P 500 having reported, about 61 percent have topped profit expectations, according to Thomson Reuters data, compared with the average of 67 percent over the past four quarters. More than 66 percent have topped revenue expectations, above the 55 percent average over that timeframe.About eight companies have issued negative outlooks for every positive one, which would mark the lowest ratio on record should it continue.After the market closed on Wednesday, Netflix Inc  reported a rise in fourth-quarter earnings, helped by subscriber growth. Shares surged 17 percent in after-hours trading.Online auction site eBay Inc surged 11 percent to $60.44 after the bell following its results. The Dow Jones industrial average was down 41.10 points, or 0.25 percent, at 16,373.34. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index was up 1.06 points, or 0.06 percent, at 1,844.86. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 17.24 points, or 0.41 percent, at 4,243.00.After a 29.6 percent jump in 2013, buoyed by the Federal Reserve's massive stimulus, the S&P 500 is down 0.2 percent this year as investors look to corporate profits to justify current prices. The index is 0.2 percent away from its all-time closing high.""In general, valuations are stretched, though there are still areas of opportunity for investors who are able to be more selective,"" said Hooper, who helps oversee $436 billion in assets under management. ""Focusing on areas with more growth may be worth paying up for.""Also in earnings, Advanced Micro Devices Inc slumped 12 percent to $3.67 after forecasting a steeper-than-expected fall in current quarter revenue, while Coach Inc tumbled 6 percent to $49.38 as the S&P's worst performer after it said sales in North America fell further in the final quarter of 2013.On the upside, Norfolk Southern Corp jumped 4.8 percent to $92.94 after its earnings beat expectations, helping lift the Dow Jones Transportation average to a record high.Nuance Communications rose 7.8 percent to $16.05 after giving a first-quarter outlook, helping to boost the Nasdaq. U.S.-listed shares of BlackBerry also buoyed the tech-heavy index, jumping 8.6 percent to $10.78.

9,"   By Maria Kiselyova and Olga Sichkar | MOSCOW  MOSCOW Express delivery companies DHL and FedEx (FDX.N) said on Thursday they had suspended foreign shipments to individual customers in Russia because of stricter customs procedures, making it harder for internet users to buy goods from abroad.President Vladimir Putin ordered a campaign late last year to ""put into order"" a booming e-commerce sector. One of the proposed measures was lowering a value threshold for purchases in foreign online stores that are subject to customs duty.According to DHL Express, part of Deutsche Post (DPWGn.DE), Russian authorities from January 2014 expanded the list of documents required to ship goods to individual customers, which has significantly slowed customs clearance.DHL will suspend all shipments of goods for personal use to Russia from January 27, the company said in emailed comments, after already suspending most such imports already in 2010. A Moscow call-centre operator for FedEx said shipments to individual customers in Russia were ""temporarily suspended"". The FedEx press office was not immediately available for comment.According to a draft letter to clients from Russia's Association of Express Carriers, seen by Reuters, other providers such as UPS (UPS.N), TNT TNTE.AS, and DPD also decided to suspend imports. UPS said it had seen significant delays in delivery of packages to private individuals in Russia due to the additional customs procedures. TNT TNTE.AS and DPD could not be reached.Maxim Andryukhin, head of representation for Russia at Bay.ru, a company which helps Russians buy products from sites such as eBay (EBAY.O) and Amazon (AMZN.O), said the procedures meant it was now asking customers to provide more documents such as a scanned copy of their passports. Alexei Zhukov, head of marketing at express delivery firm SPSR, said the customs rules had not changed, but there had been a shift in practice.""A customs officer could always request (additional) information if he had any doubts, and there were selection checks. Now, these requirements apply to all parcels,"" he said.(Reporting by Maria Kiselyova and Olga Sichkar; editing by Tom Pfeiffer)",2014-01-23,EBAY,"Thu Jan 23, 2014 | 1:18pm EST","DHL, FedEx suspend shipments to Russian customers",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-dhl-russia-idUSBREA0M1JX20140123?type=companyNews

And third, eBay funds PayPal's growth,"" Chief Executive John Donahoe told analysts on a post-results conference call.Some analysts, however, said that operating as a separate entity would encourage other online retailers to adopt the service and help retain key executives, with a spinoff that could unlock the value of a service that grew 19 percent during the holiday quarter.Shares of eBay, which also reported earnings per share a penny above Wall Street expectations, jumped as much as 12 percent. The stock was up 7 percent at $54.41 after hours.Donahoe said he had heard Icahn out but rejected his proposal. He added that the company intended to step up investments to safeguard the market position of the thriving payments service, which may exert pressure on margins.Donahoe told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday that his company started seeking advice from its financial adviser, Goldman Sachs, five days ago, following Icahn's letter to eBay.Icahn's proposal comes as the billionaire investor is urging Apple Inc to share more of its $146 billion cash pile with shareholders. The activist is demanding Apple do an additional $50 billion in share buybacks, which the company is advising shareholders to reject. Icahn did not respond to requests for comment.""I expect it to be a battle,"" BGC Partners analyst Colin Gillis said, citing eBay's longstanding opposition to a PayPal spinoff. ""One of the reasons for that is because for commerce and payments, you need to remove as much friction from those two systems as possible. If you separate it out, you put more friction between"" them.PayPal started life as an independent company, founded in the late 1990s by technology entrepreneurs including venture capital investor Peter Thiel. ECOMMERCE SUPREMACY PayPal battled with eBay for supremacy in the then-emerging online payments market. But soon after it went public in 2002, eBay acquired PayPal for $1.5 billion. Today, its growth outpaces the rest of the company and it accounts for a large chunk of eBay's overall stock market value.The unit has been a key driver of eBay's share value, as the company struggles to compete with larger rival Amazon.com Inc .Analysts have estimated that PayPal, which already yields 40 percent of the company's revenue, may account for as much as half of the corporation's market value, which now stands at about $70 billion.Icahn is known for decades of strong-arm tactics including proxy fights against major corporations. This month, he bought shares and derivatives giving him a 0.8 percent economic interest in eBay, and also nominated two of his employees to the eBay board. Those employees were not identified. ""Our directors have deep experience in the technology and financial services sectors, and a track record of value creation. This is the standard by which all future candidates will be assessed,"" Donahoe said on the call.The eBay board includes prominent Silicon Valley venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, Ford Motor Co Executive Chairman William Ford Jr., and eBay founder Pierre Omidyar.Donahoe, who spoke briefly to Icahn last week, told Reuters that he did not know Icahn's nominees and that the activist investor had not put forth any other proposals.Revenue at eBay's PayPal division rose 19 percent during the holiday quarter, fueled by the growing use of mobile phones to shop. PayPal's total payments volume, a gauge of how much it is used to complete a transaction, rose 25 percent to $180 billion worth of transactions.Companywide, revenue rose 13.5 percent to $4.53 billion for the quarter ended Dec. 31.For 2014, eBay forecast revenue of between $18 billion and $18.5 billion, while analysts expected a forecast of $18.5 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Net income for the fourth quarter was $850 million, or 65 cents a share, up from $751 million, or 57 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding some items, eBay earned 81 cents per share, a penny better than expected.On Wednesday, the company also said it had authorized an additional $5 billion in stock buybacks.",2014-01-23,EBAY,"Wed Jan 22, 2014 | 7:48pm EST",UPDATE 4-EBay dismisses Icahn proposal to spin off Paypal,http://www.reuters.com//article/ebay-results-idUSL2N0KW1UI20140123?type=companyNews

At the same time China's dominant e-commerce company is gearing up for an expected public offering later this year which will value the company at around $140 billion, according to a Reuters poll of eight analysts.The foray into boutique e-commerce was conceived and created by Vendio and Auctiva, which Alibaba.com acquired in 2010 and helped businesses sell on eBay Inc's and Amazon.com Inc's websites.

18,"   By Sam Forgione | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Feb 12 Corporate bylaw amendments that prohibit a prospective board member from gaining a board seat if the person receives compensation from a shareholder undermine shareholders' rights, activist investor Carl Icahn said on Wednesday.Icahn, in a posting on his website, said that 33 public companies had adopted such a bylaw amendment without shareholder approval as of late November.The billionaire investor, who is known for taking large stakes in companies and pushing for corporate management change, cited Service Corporation International, an operator of cemeteries and funeral homes, and gaming company International Game Technology as two companies that have adopted such measures, which he called Director Disqualification Bylaws.Icahn, in the article on his website, Shareholders' Square Table, said such measures bar a person from obtaining a spot on a company's board of directors if a shareholder nominated the person and agreed to pay the nominee a fee, including compensation for a proxy fight. ""It is absolutely offensive for an incumbent board to unilaterally adopt a Director Disqualification Bylaw without shareholder approval, and shareholders should also reject a Director Disqualification Bylaw if their incumbent board puts one up for a vote in the future,"" Icahn said.He said that since shareholders are already fully informed of compensation arrangements between activist investors and board nominees under federal securities laws, the bylaw amendment ""undermines the most basic right of shareholders"" to decide who should join a company's board.Icahn is chairman of investment firm Icahn Enterprises L.P.  and holds substantial stakes in companies including Apple Inc, Ebay and Talisman Energy Inc . ""We'll continue to hold CEOs & boards more accountable & grow partnerships btwn activists & institutional investors to help #ShareholderValue,"" Icahn wrote on social media platform Twitter on Jan. 8.On Wednesday, Icahn noted that proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. said in mid-January that it may recommend a vote against such bylaws. ""The adoption of restrictive director qualification bylaws without shareholder approval may be considered a material failure of governance because the ability to elect directors is a fundamental shareholder right,"" ISS said on Jan. 13.ISS in its statement said that it has not recommended voting against directors and boards that have adopted bylaws prohibiting nominees who fail to disclose third-party compensation from taking board seats, saying that ""such provisions may provide greater transparency for shareholders.""Icahn recently took a more than $4 billion stake in Apple Inc. and had waged a public campaign to get Apple to return more cash to shareholders.In a letter to Apple shareholders on Monday, Icahn said he was ditching his non-binding proposal to force Apple to add another $50 billion to its stock buyback plan, citing the company's recent repurchases as well as ISS's call against his proposal.",2014-02-12,EBAY,"Wed Feb 12, 2014 | 12:36pm EST",Icahn says bylaw amendments on directors undercut shareholder rights,http://www.reuters.com//article/investing-bylaws-icahn-idUSL2N0LH14P20140212?type=companyNews
19,"   By Svea Herbst-Bayliss  Top U.S. hedge fund managers in the fourth quarter focused on the consumer sector, with investment plays ranging from high-end auction house Sotheby's to eBay Inc, the multinational Internet consumer-to-consumer corporation.General Motors also became the flavor of the quarter with many hedge funds as the U.S. government exited its position. This year, however, the stock price has fallen nearly 14 percent, making for a rough start for new CEO Mary Barra.But on Friday, the automaker's stock rose 62 cent, or 1.76 percent, to $35.82.The quarterly disclosures of manager stock holdings, in so-called 13F filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, are always intriguing for investors trying to divine a pattern in what savvy traders are selling and buying.But relying on the filings to develop an investment strategy comes with some peril because the disclosures are backward looking and come out 45 days after the end of each quarter.Still, the filings offer a glimpse into what hedge fund managers saw as opportunities to make money on the long side. The filings don't disclose short positions, bets that a stock will fall in price. And there's also little disclosure on bonds and other securities that do not trade on exchanges.Upon request, the SEC also permits managers to omit sensitive stock positions from 13F filings. As a result, the public filings don't always present a complete picture of a manager's stock holdings.Here are some of the hot stocks and sectors in which hedge fund managers either took new positions or exited from in the fourth quarter.SOTHEBY'S Activist investor Marcato Capital Management, run by Mick McGuire, boosted the firm's holdings of Sotheby's by 35 percent, having bought an additional 1,200,000 shares in the auction house to now own 4,562,991.eBAYFarallon Capital Management put on a new position in the online auction house and bought 3,295,000 shares.

Scout Capital may be going on a junk food diet, as it liquidated its entire position in Whole Foods and Starbucks but added 3.9 million shares in Yum!

21,"   By Sam Forgione | NEW YORK  NEW YORK E-commerce auction house eBay Inc became a darling among top U.S. hedge funds in the fourth quarter just before billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn urged the company to spin off its PayPal payments business, regulatory filings showed on Friday.Farallon Capital Management took a new stake of 3,295,000 shares in the online auction house and Leon Cooperman's Omega Advisors also took a new stake of 854,800 shares ahead of Icahn's proposal, which the company rejected.The enthusiasm for eBay further spotlights the company after it announced on January 22 that Icahn had taken a 0.82 percent stake earlier that month. Icahn, chairman of Icahn Enterprises L.P., is known for taking large stakes in companies and pushing for management change.Icahn's latest quarterly disclosures appeared to confirm eBay's timeline, since they did not show a stake in the company as of December 31, 2013.Reuters reported a day after eBay announced Icahn's stake that the activist investor had taken a larger stake of close to 2 percent, according to a source.The confidence in eBay's shares suggests that key investors see further gains. The company's stock price rose 7.6 percent in 2013 and is up 7.4 percent so far this year. The stock price jumped as much as 12 percent after it reported better-than-expected earnings and Icahn's stake on January 22. Not all hedge funds showed their love for eBay in the fourth quarter. Eric Mindich's Eton Park Capital Management cut its position in the company by more than 2 million shares in the fourth quarter, still leaving the stake at a sizeable 2.4 million shares, according to the regulatory filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, known as 13Fs.Ebay was not the only stock that Icahn and others agreed on in the fourth quarter. Icahn, who announced a ""large position"" in Apple Inc via Twitter in mid-August, found kindred spirits in activist investor Daniel Loeb and Blue Ridge, both of whom opened new positions in the company.Loeb's Third Point hedge fund took a stake of 100,000 shares in Apple, while Blue Ridge took a new position of 320,000 shares. David Tepper's Appaloosa Management was an exception, cutting its stake by 12 percent to 215,320 shares. For his part, Icahn's stake of 4.7 million shares at the end of December showed that he did not buy any shares of the company between October 24 and the end of last year.In a letter to Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook made public on October 24, Icahn revealed that he owned 4,730,739 shares in the company as of that morning, the same amount disclosed in the regulatory filing for the period ended December 31.In late January, however, Icahn tweeted that he had bought another half-billion dollars of Apple stock, boosting the value of his stake in the company to more than $4 billion. Icahn waged a public campaign to get Apple to return more cash to shareholders but said earlier this week in a letter to shareholders that he was ditching his non-binding proposal to force Apple to add another $50 billion to its stock buyback plan.He cited the company's recent repurchases as well as influential proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services Inc's call against his proposal.Icahn's latest regulatory filings also showed that he owned 60.8 million shares of Nuance Communications, marking a 15.9 percent increase from his stake in the third quarter. Nuance makes the software that runs the Siri feature on Apple's iPhones.Icahn did not show a stake in car rental company Hertz Global Holdings Inc in his fourth-quarter regulatory filings.

Loeb's Third Point hedge fund took a stake of 100,000 shares in Apple, while Blue Ridge took a new position of 320,000 shares. David Tepper's Appaloosa Management was an exception, cutting its stake by 12 percent to 215,320 shares.For his part, Icahn's stake of 4.7 million shares at the end of December showed that he did not buy any shares of the company between October 24 and the end of last year.In a letter to Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook made public on October 24, Icahn revealed that he owned 4,730,739 shares in the company as of that morning, the same amount disclosed in the regulatory filing for the period ended December 31. In late January, however, Icahn tweeted that he had bought another half-billion dollars of Apple stock, boosting the value of his stake in the company to more than $4 billion.Icahn waged a public campaign to get Apple to return more cash to shareholders but said earlier this week in a letter to shareholders that he was ditching his non-binding proposal to force Apple to add another $50 billion to its stock buyback plan.He cited the company's recent repurchases as well as influential proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services Inc's call against his proposal.Icahn's latest regulatory filings also showed that he owned 60.8 million shares of Nuance Communications, marking a 15.9 percent increase from his stake in the third quarter. Nuance makes the software that runs the Siri feature on Apple's iPhones.Icahn did not show a stake in car rental company Hertz Global Holdings Inc in his fourth-quarter regulatory filings. CNBC television reported on January 3 that the investor had acquired between 30 million and 40 million shares in the company, which sent its shares up about 1.7 percent.

38,"   By Phil Wahba and Nadia Damouni | NEW YORK  NEW YORK EBay Inc CEO John Donahoe said on Wednesday that several of the online retailer's most active shareholders have assured him they support his efforts to resist demands by activist investor Carl Icahn for a spin-off of the PayPal unit.Donahoe told Reuters on Wednesday he has spoken with as many as 16 of the 20 most-active shareholders in eBay, and most favored hanging on to the fast-growing PayPal payments unit. He did not say what percentage of the company's shares were held by the investors who agreed with his resistance to Icahn.""I met with 15, 16 of our top 20 active investors, have engaged back and forth in dialogue with them,"" Donahoe told Reuters in an interview.""The majority of them understand that they're stronger together,"" he said. PayPal had become the preferred online payment method of the online marketplace's customers when eBay acquired it for $1.5 billion in 2002. The top 20 shareholders hold a combined 42 percent of eBay shares, according to Thomson Reuters. Its top shareholder, eBay founder Pierre Omidyar, holds 8.4 percent of the shares and has repeatedly expressed support for eBay's plan to stay intact.Icahn owns just over 2 percent of the eBay. Management has sparred relentlessly with him since January, when the company announced that the pugnacious billionaire had made an unsolicited proposal that eBay hive off PayPal. Until now, neither side had addressed the question of how other investors viewed a prospective spinoff.Icahn was not immediately available for comment. Earlier on Wednesday, he said corporate governance at eBay was the worst he had ever seen, the latest volley in a feud that has included several press releases by Icahn and television appearances. Icahn has sent letters to shareholders accusing two eBay directors of conflicts of interest, and calling the board dysfunctional. He has proposed two new directors.In the past, eBay has considered spinning off the multibillion-dollar payments service. But the company concluded that PayPal would lose synergies with the overall e-commerce business if it were an independent unit. Donahoe suggested that activist shareholders can play a constructive role, under some circumstances.""If you were to look at a spectrum of activists, you see a different playbook, you see different approaches,"" Donahoe said.A case in point, Donahoe said, is Ralph Whitworth, co-founder of activist investment fund Relational Investors LLC, whom Donahoe praised for ""not playing it out in the media"" prior to winning a seat on Hewlett-Packard Co's board.

""The noise is going to get louder over the next four to six to eight weeks,"" Donahue said in a video addressed to employees. ""Don't pay attention to the noise. Stay focused, and don't be distracted.""The thing to keep in mind is that we have more insight around our own company than anyone on the outside can,"" he said. ""It's easy to say when you're sitting on the outside, 'Oh, simplistically separate, and we'll do some short-term financial maneuvering to drive the share price up.'"" Icahn, who owns just over 2 percent of eBay, has sparred with eBay management via open letters and press releases since January, when the pugnacious billionaire made an unsolicited proposal for eBay to spin off PayPal.

52,"  (Adds eBay comment)By Phil WahbaMarch 19 Activist investor Carl Icahn on Wednesday called on eBay Inc to sell 20 percent of its PayPal payments unit in an initial public offering, a change in tack from his previous call for a complete spinoff.Icahn in January called for eBay to hive off its fast growing PayPal business, arguing the unit is undervalued as part of eBay.In recent weeks, Icahn has sent a series of open letters critical of eBay Chief Executive John Donahoe, the board, and corporate governance at the e-commerce company. In his latest missive to fellow eBay shareholders, he said selling off only part of PayPal would retain the benefits of a stand-alone PayPal while maintaining the efficiencies of having eBay and PayPal together.""A partial separation of PayPal is not a new idea, and we're glad to see that Mr. Icahn now seems to agree that a full separation of PayPal is not a good idea,"" eBay said in a statement, re-iterating its position that the two businesses are better off under the same umbrella.As a public company, the payments firm should also command a higher valuation than as part of a larger corporation, shedding the ""conglomerate discount,"" Icahn said. Its stock could then also be used to bankroll future acquisitions. ""Conducting a 20% IPO of PayPal - and creating two dedicated and highly-focused independent businesses - will provide the best opportunity for these businesses to remain competitive over the long-term,"" said Icahn, who owns more than 2 percent of eBay.EBay bought PayPal for $1.5 billion in 2002. The billionaire Icahn said eBay and PayPal could enter into a long-term commercial contract that does not require eBay to own all of PayPal, to preserve their ties.He also said PayPal has a significant opportunity to offer new services such as check writing and direct deposits.A standalone PayPal and eBay would benefit from having their own independent management teams, Icahn argued.PayPal needs to be independent to compete in the mobile payments industry, Icahn said, repeating an assertion he has frequently made in a series of open letters in recent weeks.

But in a concession to the famously pugnacious activist investor, eBay added David Dorman, a founding partner of investment firm Centerview Capital Technology, as a 10th independent director.The settlement caps a months-long acerbic war of words and marked a reversal for Icahn, who had accused eBay Chief Executive Officer John Donahoe of ""inexcusable incompetence"" and attacked the company's board repeatedly for shoddy governance.He appeared to soften his stance on Thursday, saying he found several of Donahoe's ideas ""compelling"" and looked forward to working with eBay's board.In an interview with Reuters, Icahn said he might add to his eBay holdings. He added that while he supported a PayPal split in the near future, now was not the time.""If they did the split-up now, yes, the stock would go up,"" Icahn said.

Both the Nasdaq biotechnology index and the NYSEArca biotech index  lost more than 2 percent. The S&P technology sector  shed 0.5 percent as one of the worst-performing S&P sectors.

Britain's Reckitt Benckiser Group Plc  confirmed talks to buy Merck's consumer health business, the latest asset up for grabs in a wave of recent pharmaceutical deals. ""Investors are viewing (that activity) as a signal for positive conditions in which businesses are willing and able to offer substantial sums of cash and/or stocks,"" said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia.Also supportive: most S&P 500 companies are beating earnings forecasts, albeit on lowered expectations, he said.Earnings estimates have rebounded, however, as more companies have reported results.

The stock was down 10.2 percent in after-hours trading.Also after the bell, shares of eBay fell 3.8 percent to $52.45 as its second-quarter forecast fell short of estimates. During the regular session, Sprint Corp shares jumped 11.3 percent to $8.27. The No. 3 U.S. mobile provider reported an increase in quarterly revenue, as expected, due to a new billing plan that lowered wireless expenses.On the down side, Coach Inc reported a sharp drop in North American sales and the stock slumped 9.3 percent to $45.71.Archer Daniels Midland Co finished down 2.6 percent at $43.23 after its first-quarter profit and sales missed Wall Street estimates.About 6.3 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, below the 6.6 billion average this month, according to data from BATS Global Markets.The Fed's two-day policy meeting began on Tuesday, with the central bank expected to again scale back its monthly bond purchase program.

74,"   By Deepa Seetharaman | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO The online payment company PayPal is getting a shiny new look and its first-ever global marketing push as parent eBay Inc tries to wrest attention away from the growing number of rivals piling into the mobile payments market.The brand overhaul unveiled on Wednesday includes a more vibrant, simple logo designed to suit mobile phones and wearable devices like wristbands and PayPal's first-ever television ads in the U.S. market. The campaign will last throughout the summer and into fall 2014.The move comes as PayPal, the dominant online payment processor, shifts its focus toward mobile phones and the fast-growing market to enable consumers to pay for physical goods and services with their smartphones.""If you look at us visually online, we look very similar to financial service companies,"" said Christina Smedley, vice president of global brand and communications at PayPal.""Our brands and the ways consumers are going to experience them, the way people are going to touch us, is going to change hugely in coming years,"" she said. The company declined to specify the total cost of the marketing campaign, but said it was the largest ever planned for PayPal, which accounts for a large chunk of eBay's overall stock market value and its growth outpaces the rest of the company.The U.S. mobile payment market will reach $90 billion by 2017, up from $12.8 billion in 2012, according to Forrester Research. Research firm Gartner expects the global market will see a more than threefold rise by 2017 to $721 billion.That potential has attracted the likes of Amazon.com Inc, Google Inc and Square Inc. Between 3 percent and 7 percent of consumers worldwide use in-store mobile payments, but up to 27 percent are willing to try, according to Bain & Company. With 143 million active users at the end of 2013, PayPal is the dominant online payment provider, but it is not used widely for in-store payments in the United States, Bain said.""Our research showed that people needed to be reminded of some of the core benefits that we have and this felt like a way we could bring it together,"" Smedley said. This is the first makeover for PayPal since 2007. The logo was developed by the firm led by designer Yves Behar, who is also chief creative officer for Jawbone, a maker of headsets and a fitness-tracker product.The marketing efforts come a few weeks after activist investor Carl Icahn dropped his efforts to force eBay to hive off PayPal, eBay's most attractive and fastest-growing unit.During a call on Tuesday to discuss first-quarter earnings, Chief Executive John Donahoe said eBay was focused on extending PayPal's scope and its marketing spending for PayPal will ramp up in coming quarters.""Our focus at this stage is extend the reach and if we extend the reach over time, we will have plenty of opportunity to monetize,"" Donahoe said.(Editing by Matt Driskill)",2014-04-30,EBAY,"Wed Apr 30, 2014 | 6:13pm EDT",PayPal burnishes brand image as mobile use surges,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-ebay-paypal-marketing-idUSBREA3T0PE20140430?type=companyNews

That will keep it on track to end the program as soon as October. That the Fed looked past a dismal reading on first-quarter growth reinforced the view that weather was to blame for the weakness, analysts said.""They are seeing some economic activity pick up after the slowdown during the winter,"" said Joe Bell, senior equity analyst at Schaeffer's Investment Research in Cincinnati. That ""is one positive sign.""Nine of the 10 S&P 500 sectors ended in the black, led by the economically-sensitive S&P materials sector, up 0.8 percent. Exxon Mobil, up 0.9 percent at $102.41, led gains on the S&P 500. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 45.47 points or 0.27 percent, to 16,580.84, a record high close. It was the first record close of the year for the Dow.The S&P 500 gained 5.62 points or 0.3 percent, to 1,883.95 and the Nasdaq Composite added 11.013 points or 0.27 percent, to 4,114.556.For the month, the Dow and S&P 500 posted slight gains, while the Nasdaq dropped 2 percent following weeks of heavy selling in tech and biotech ""momentum"" stocks. The Dow was up 0.7 percent in April; the S&P 500 was up 0.6 percent.Stocks were near steady for most of the session, then slowly edged to session highs following the Fed announcement. EBay was among the biggest negative influences on both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq.

80,"   By Deepa Seetharaman | SAN FRANCISCO, April 30  SAN FRANCISCO, April 30The online payment company PayPal is getting a shiny new look and its first-ever global marketing push as parent eBay Inc tries to wrest attention away from the growing number of rivals piling into the mobile payments market.The brand overhaul unveiled on Wednesday includes a more vibrant, simple logo designed to suit mobile phones and wearable devices like wristbands and PayPal's first-ever television ads in the U.S. market. The campaign will last throughout the summer and into fall 2014.The move comes as PayPal, the dominant online payment processor, shifts its focus toward mobile phones and the fast-growing market to enable consumers to pay for physical goods and services with their smartphones.""If you look at us visually online, we look very similar to financial service companies,"" said Christina Smedley, vice president of global brand and communications at PayPal.""Our brands and the ways consumers are going to experience them, the way people are going to touch us, is going to change hugely in coming years,"" she said. The company declined to specify the total cost of the marketing campaign, but said it was the largest ever planned for PayPal, which accounts for a large chunk of eBay's overall stock market value and its growth outpaces the rest of the company.The U.S. mobile payment market will reach $90 billion by 2017, up from $12.8 billion in 2012, according to Forrester Research. Research firm Gartner expects the global market will see a more than threefold rise by 2017 to $721 billion.That potential has attracted the likes of Amazon.com Inc , Google Inc and Square Inc. Between 3 percent and 7 percent of consumers worldwide use in-store mobile payments, but up to 27 percent are willing to try, according to Bain & Company. With 143 million active users at the end of 2013, PayPal is the dominant online payment provider, but it is not used widely for in-store payments in the United States, Bain said.""Our research showed that people needed to be reminded of some of the core benefits that we have and this felt like a way we could bring it together,"" Smedley said. This is the first makeover for PayPal since 2007. The logo was developed by the firm led by designer Yves Behar, who is also chief creative officer for Jawbone, a maker of headsets and a fitness-tracker product.The marketing efforts come a few weeks after activist investor Carl Icahn dropped his efforts to force eBay to hive off PayPal, eBay's most attractive and fastest-growing unit.During a call on Tuesday to discuss first-quarter earnings, Chief Executive John Donahoe said eBay was focused on extending PayPal's scope and its marketing spending for PayPal will ramp up in coming quarters.""Our focus at this stage is extend the reach and if we extend the reach over time, we will have plenty of opportunity to monetize,"" Donahoe said.(Editing by Matt Driskill)",2014-04-30,EBAY,"Wed Apr 30, 2014 | 12:00pm EDT",PayPal burnishes brand image as mobile use surges,http://www.reuters.com//article/ebay-paypal-marketing-idUSL2N0NH20O20140430?type=companyNews

86,"   By Jonathan Stempel  A former executive at an e-commerce company that was acquired in 2011 by online retailer eBay Inc pleaded guilty on Friday to insider trading in connection with the takeover.Christopher Saridakis, 45, who had led the marketing solutions division of GSI Commerce Inc, pleaded guilty to one count of securities fraud for leaking material nonpublic information in March 2011 about the planned merger.The defendant entered his plea before U.S. District Judge Stewart Dalzell in Philadelphia, and was released on $300,000 bail, court records show. Saridakis faces a maximum 20 years in prison at his sentencing, which is scheduled for September 19.""Mr. Saridakis has pleaded guilty and accepted responsibility,"" said his lawyer, Richard Zack, a partner at Pepper Hamilton. ""He has done everything he can to make things right, and he regrets the pain that his conduct has caused his family and friends."" GSI shares rose nearly 51 percent on March 28, 2011, after eBay announced its $1.96 billion purchase of the King of Prussia, Pennsylvania-based company.Investigators said Saridakis encouraged two relatives and two friends to trade on his tips, leading to more than $300,000 of illegal profit. On April 25, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said Saridakis, of Greenville, Delaware, agreed to pay $664,822 and accept an officer and director ban to settle related civil charges.Six other defendants, including a Manhattan hair salon owner, settled SEC charges over trading ahead of the merger. One of the settling defendants was an unnamed trader who the SEC said provided ""early, extraordinary and unconditional"" cooperation.

87,"   By Sam Forgione  May 15 Top U.S. hedge fund managers in the first quarter zoned in on the consumer sector, with investments that included eBay Inc, Dollar General Corp and Walgreen Co.Leon Cooperman's Omega Advisors opened a new stake of 1.7 million shares in discount retailer Dollar General, while Barry Rosenstein's Jana Partners increased its stake in drug store operator Walgreen by 4.8 million shares to 12.1 million shares, regulatory filings showed on Thursday.EBay, which became a darling among top U.S. hedge funds in the fourth quarter just before billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn urged the company to spin off its PayPal payments business, continued to find fans in the first quarter.Omega increased its stake in eBay to 2.9 million shares from 854,800 shares and Jana opened a new stake of 3.9 million shares during the first quarter.The quarterly disclosures of manager stock holdings, in what are known as 13F filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, are always intriguing for investors trying to divine a pattern in what savvy traders are selling and buying.But relying on the filings to develop an investment strategy comes with some peril because the disclosures are backward looking and come out 45 days after the end of each quarter.Still, the filings offer a glimpse into what hedge fund managers saw as opportunities to make money on the long side. The filings do not disclose short positions, bets that a stock will fall in price. And there is also little disclosure on bonds and other securities that do not trade on exchanges. Upon request, the SEC also permits managers to omit sensitive stock positions from 13F filings. As a result, the public filings don't always present a complete picture of a manager's stock holdings.Here are some of the hot stocks and sectors in which hedge fund managers either took new positions or exited from in the first quarter.COCA-COLA ENTERPRISES  Tiger Global Management LLC, led by Chase Coleman and Feroz Dewan, slashed its stake in soft drink producer and distributor Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc by 14.5 percent to 6.7 million shares.JPMORGAN CHASE & CO Omega Advisors increased its stake in JPMorgan Chase & Co  by 1.6 million shares to 1.7 million shares in the first quarter. The bank's shares rose 3.8 percent in the quarter, compared with a 2.2 percent gain in the S&P financial index , which includes all financial shares in the benchmark S&P 500 stock index. GROUPON INC Jana Partners increased its stake in Groupon Inc's  class A shares by 9.8 million shares to 40.8 million class A shares. Chase Coleman and Feroz Dewan's Tiger Global Management got rid of its entire stake in the operator of a ""deal-of-the-day"" website.GENERAL MOTORS CO Jana Partners sold nearly all of its stake General Motors Co , cutting its holding by about 8 million shares to just 7,100 shares. Omega Advisors sold its entire stake of 1.05 million shares. Shares of the automaker fell 15.8 percent in the first quarter.Since February GM has recalled 2.6 million cars because of   defective ignition switches prone to being jostled into accessory mode while the cars are moving. That would shut off engines and disable power steering, power brakes and air bags. The problem has been linked to at least 13 deaths.

88,"   By Jim Finkle, Soham Chatterjee and Lehar Maan | BOSTON/BANGALORE  BOSTON/BANGALORE EBay Inc said on Wednesday that a cyber attack carried out three months ago has compromised customer data, and the company urged 145 million users of its online commerce platform to change their passwords.The company said unknown hackers stole email addresses, encrypted passwords, birth dates, mailing addresses and other information in an attack carried out between late February and early March. The files did not contain financial information.An eBay spokeswoman said a large number of accounts may have been compromised, but declined to say how many. EBay said it found no evidence of unauthorized access to financial or credit card information at its PayPal payments subsidiary, which encrypts and stores its data separately.EBay shares were down 0.2 percent late Wednesday afternoon, compared with a 0.9 percent rise in the Nasdaq Composite Index.The e-commerce company's stock has steadily fallen since late March as part of a broader slide in technology shares. Last month, eBay reached an accord with activist investor Carl Icahn, who had been calling for the company to spin out PayPal, which is growing quickly.FRAUD ALERT Security experts advised EBay customers to be on the alert for fraud, especially if they used the same passwords for other accounts.""This is not a breach that only hurts EBay.

The files did not contain financial information.An eBay spokeswoman said a large number of accounts may have been compromised, but declined to say how many. EBay said it found no evidence of unauthorized access to financial or credit card information at its PayPal payments subsidiary, which encrypts and stores its data separately.EBay shares were down 0.2 percent late Wednesday afternoon, compared with a 0.9 percent rise in the Nasdaq Composite Index.The e-commerce company's stock has steadily fallen since late March as part of a broader slide in technology shares.

Story originally said that hackers copied the entire database.)* Poised to go down as 2nd largest breach in U.S. history* EBay says encrypted passwords were taken* Says no reason to believe they have been unscrambledBy Jim FinkleBOSTON, May 21 EBay Inc said that hackers raided its network three months ago, accessing some 145 million user records in what is poised to go down as one of the biggest data breaches in history, based on the number of accounts compromised.It advised customers to change their passwords immediately, saying they were among the pieces of data stolen by cyber criminals who carried out the attack between late February and early March.EBay spokeswoman Amanda Miller told Reuters late on Wednesday that those passwords were encrypted and that the company had no reason to believe the hackers had broken the code that scrambled them. ""There is no evidence of impact on any eBay customers,"" Miller said. ""We don't know that they decrypted the passwords because it would not be easy to do.""She said the hackers gained access to 145 million records of which they copied ""a large part"". Those records contained passwords as well as email addresses, birth dates, mailing addresses and other personal information, but not financial data such as credit card numbers.Miller also said the company has hired FireEye Inc's  Mandiant forensics division to help investigate the matter. Mandiant is known for publishing a February 2013 report that described what it said was a Shanghai-based hacking group linked to the Peoples Liberation Army.EBay earlier said a large number of accounts may have been compromised, but declined to say how many. Security experts advised EBay customers to be on the alert for fraud, especially if they used the same passwords for other accounts.""People need to stop reusing passwords and should change their affected passwords immediately across all the sites where they are used,"" said Trey Ford, global security strategist with cybersecurity firm Rapid7.Michael Coates, director of product security with Shape Security, said there is a significant risk that the hackers would unscramble the passwords because typically companies only ask users to change passwords if they believe there is a reasonable chance attackers may be able to do so. Still, eBay said it had not seen any indication of increased fraudulent activity on its flagship site and that there was no evidence its PayPal online payment service had been breached.EBay said the hackers got in after obtaining login credentials for ""a small number"" of employees, allowing them to access eBay's corporate network.It discovered the breach in early May and immediately brought in security experts and law enforcement to investigate, Miller said.""We worked aggressively and as quickly as possible to insure accurate and thorough disclosure of the nature and extent of the compromise,"" Miller said when asked why the company had not immediately notified users.The breach could go down as the second-biggest in history at a U.S. company, based on the number records accessed by the hackers.Computer security experts say the biggest such breach was uncovered at software maker Adobe Systems Inc in October 2013, when hackers accessed about 152 million user accounts.It would be larger than the one that Target Corp  disclosed in December of last year, which included some 40 million payment card numbers and another 70 million customer records.

105,"   By Nandita Bose | MUMBAI  MUMBAI Online retailers jostling for a chunk of India's $13 billion e-commerce trade are so desperate to avoid snarled roads and inefficient railways that they fly their packages in the passenger cabin of costly commercial flights. The cargo, however, often gets bumped off.India's largest domestic e-tailer Flipkart as well as bigger global rivals like Amazon and eBay Inc are widening their supplier networks or racing to build multi-million dollar logistics networks to circumvent crumbling infrastructure, keen to attract customers by shrinking delivery times to same-day or even as short as nine hours.In the meantime, they remain at the mercy of commercial airlines, which frequently remove their parcels to make room for passengers, highlighting one of the challenges to expanding in an e-commerce market that consultants say is growing at a compound rate of 34 percent a year, and which saw online retail sales of $1.6 billion last year.   ""It is unfortunate, but offloading does happen and we have to make sure our delivery promises take that into consideration,"" Rahul Chari, vice-president, supply chain technologies at Flipkart, told Reuters. Up to 90 percent of goods ordered online in India are moved by air, which pushes up delivery costs by around half, according to several online retailers and logistics companies. Road and rail transport networks remain woefully underdeveloped and entangled in graft and bureaucracy.With a population exceeding 1.1 billion, a burgeoning middle class and better Internet access, India's e-commerce potential is huge. Online retail sales are expected to surge to $76 billion by 2021, according to consultants Forrester, and the segment is growing at a much slower pace than other emerging markets, including China.E-commerce is poised to get a boost as early as next month, when the government is expected to allow online retailers to sell directly to consumers. Logistics, however, remains the biggest barrier to growth and transport troubles are just the tip of the iceberg.Most e-tailers use sometime unreliable third-party delivery firms, more than half of sales are paid for with cash-on-delivery, return rates are high and orders made to fake addresses are all too common.""The biggest advantage of e-commerce is the instant nationwide reach it enables sellers of all sizes, however, it is the delivery of that opportunity that requires significant focus and investment from the industry,"" Amit Agarwal, Amazon's vice president and country manager, told Reuters in an e-mail. MOVING IN-HOUSE With India's perennial infrastructure failings far from being resolved, most e-tailers are focusing their investment on setting up their own capital-intensive logistics businesses.Flipkart, founded by two former Amazon executives in 2007 is aggressively growing its logistics arm E-Kart. Amazon, the world's biggest online retailer, is pumping up the capacities at Amazon Logistics. That's in addition to existing partnerships with third-party logistics firms including GATI, Blue Dart and FedEx Corp. ""Having a control over what customers want is a big driver because now we are able to have a channel through which we can gather a lot of feedback and tailor our services accordingly,"" said Flipkart's Chari. The company counts South Africa's Naspers Ltd as an investor.To reduce air shipments, Flipkart is setting up regional warehouses and signing up more suppliers across the country to ensure customers get orders delivered by the nearest supplier, he said.Having its own network now means Flipkart can handle delivery rescheduling requests better, manage product returns faster and help customers exchange products, services that are time-consuming when handled by a third-party operator. Amazon is using a similar strategy. In addition to building its own warehouses, it is trialing using neighborhood grocery stores and petrol stations as delivery points.It also struck agreements with the Indian Postal Service to reach far-flung places in the country, Agrawal said.eBay, by contrast, is working with external logistics firms to cut back on multiple state taxes for products shipped by road and the excessive documentation required to move every parcel.It is also intensively training its 45,000-strong supplier base, which hold all the inventory eBay sells on its platforms,  to improve efficiency.""In this business, it is important we do what we are good at and let our logistics partners do what they are good at,"" said Latif Nathani, eBay India's managing director. FROM LAPTOPS TO REFRIGERATORS The anticipated boom in online retail is encouraging logistics firms to better their services, but it will take several years before India gets an efficient network, said Bablu Tewari, chief operating officer for e-commerce and international business with Gati. The company is one of India's largest logistics firms, delivering for Amazon and eBay.""Nobody shipped products which weighed more than two kilos like say laptops and now suddenly people are moving refrigerators,"" Tewari said.For the many Indian e-tailers that lack the deep pockets of Amazon and Flipkart, air freight and couriers are not an option. Instead, they are altering their packaging and product lines to ensure they can reach customers via road and rail.Pepperfry, one of India's largest online furniture and home products retailer, is training suppliers to make knock-down, foldable products, similar to IKEA furnishings.Flat-packaged goods reduce shipping costs, said founder and Chief Executive Officer Ambareesh Murty. The company also provides carpenters to assemble the items once delivered.Industry consultants say companies like Pepperfry that are able to adapt their business to the ailing infrastructure are better placed to take advantage of the expected e-commerce boom.

112,"   By Zachary Fagenson | MIAMI  MIAMI Auction website eBay has refused to list a World War II-era Mercedes Benz once owned Hermann Goering, a Nazi leader who commanded the German air force, citing a policy prohibiting the sale of offensive items.The 1941 Mercedes Benz 540 K Cabriolet B, custom built by Daimler-Benz for Adolf Hitler’s close confidant, is currently in pieces in a high-end south Florida automobile shop, where owners said they plan to spend about $750,000 to restore it to working condition.“We’ve located all the replacement parts and we can make parts,” said High Velocity Classics co-owner David Rathbun.eBay, however, asked the owners to take down the auction after learning it would go live in early July. “eBay has policies in place that prohibit the sale of offensive materials and content, which includes listings that promote or glorify hatred, violence or racial, sexual or religious intolerance,” spokesman Ryan Moore wrote in an email.According to Rathbun, the car was seized by the U.S. Army’s 7th Infantry Division in Berchtesgaden, a town in the Bavarian Alps where Hitler built a sprawling residence.After the war it became army surplus and was eventually sold by the head of a psychology institution in Heilbronn to Master Sergeant Sam Hosier, who drove it in occupied Germany. Hosier brought it to the United States and in 1955 sold it to a North Carolina man, who owned it until this year. The owners would not say how much they paid for the car, only that they hope it will sell for $5 million to $7 million.Another of Goering's cars, a convertible Mercedes 540 K nicknamed the Blue Goose, was auctioned in 2011 in Italy by Ontario, Canada-based RM Auctions for about $2 million. The owners lamented having to turn to traditional high-end auto sales auctions to sell the stretch coupe once work is finished.“eBay is all over the world, it has hundreds of millions of users, and it was the biggest venue anyone could find,” Rathbun said.

Adidas had previously said it wanted its products to be sold only via expert and specialist retailers rather than eBay and Amazon to ensure they were presented ""in the best possible way and in the right environment"". Adidas said on Tuesday it had made the change because the functionality of e-commerce distribution channels had improved as the market had evolved. A spokesman for the German cartel office, which in April expressed concern over similar restrictions imposed by rival sportswear firm Asics Corp, said on Tuesday it was close to concluding an investigation into Adidas.The Cartel Office, which is still investigating Asics, has said the ban of the sale of its products via market-place sites amounts to a way of limiting price competition.

He also claimed he was not involved in money laundering because bitcoins are not money.In a 51-page decision, U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest in Manhattan said, ""the design and operation"" of Silk Road and Ulbricht's role as an ""intermediary"" between website users justified letting prosecutors pursue their case.""The allegations amount to Ulbricht acting as a sort of 'godfather' - determining the territory, the actions which may be undertaken, and the commissions he will retain; disciplining others to stay in line, and generally casting himself as a leader,"" Forrest wrote.

124,"   By Edwin Chan | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO EBay Inc posted a 13 percent rise in quarterly revenue on Wednesday, as better-than-expected results from its fast-growing PayPal division helped the online retailer overcome increasing competition from Amazon.com Inc and a well-publicized cyber attack.Investors had been braced for a tough quarter. Ebay's stock has fallen more than 8 percent since April, hurt by the cyber attack disclosed in May that compromised data for some 145 million customers, the departure of highly regarded PayPal chief David Marcus, and intensifying competition from both online and offline rivals.EBay was also hurt by a change in Google Inc's algorithm, which pushed eBay results lower in search rankings, slowing traffic.That slowdown was seen in June in a measure of transactions across eBay's core Marketplaces platform, known as gross merchandise value, with the growth rate falling to 7 percent from around a double-digit pace in previous months.""We had a challenging first half of the year with several distractions,"" Bob Swan, the chief financial officer, told analysts on a conference call, noting that the cyber attack and the Google search engine changes ""had an immediate and dramatic impact."" Executives said eBay will spend more on measures to entice users back, including coupons, seller incentives and increased marketing.Several investment brokerages had downgraded their forecasts ahead of Wednesday's results. The second-quarter results and eBay's revenue outlook were roughly in line with those tempered expectations.    Revenue rose to $4.37 billion for the quarter, compared with $3.88 billion a year ago; Wall Street had forecast revenue of $4.38 billion, on average.Payment volume leaped a better-than-expected 29 percent. Gross merchandise value grew 12 percent, in line with or slightly better than analysts' forecasts. Going forward, eBay will have to grapple with stiffening competition across its businesses.Marcus departed for Facebook's messaging team in June. The payments service faces a growing challenge from the likes of Amazon, which launched a recurring payments program in June. Google is also expected to delve further into this field.    Brick-and-mortar retailers are investing to boost their online presence. EBay also has to fend off a growing coterie of fast-growing retail upstarts that focus on specific categories such as home and apparel.Longer term, industry analysts speculate that Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holdings Ltd, which is going public this year in what could be the largest-ever tech IPO, is preparing to leverage its U.S. investments into a play for the U.S. retail arena, the world's largest.

125,"  (Adds executives' comments)By Edwin ChanSAN FRANCISCO, July 16 EBay Inc posted a 13 percent rise in quarterly revenue on Wednesday, as better-than-expected results from its fast-growing PayPal division helped the online retailer overcome increasing competition from Amazon.com Inc and a well-publicized cyber attack.Investors had been braced for a tough quarter.Ebay's stock has fallen more than 8 percent since April, hurt by the cyber attack disclosed in May that compromised data for some 145 million customers, the departure of highly regarded PayPal chief David Marcus, and intensifying competition from both online and offline rivals.EBay was also hurt by a change in Google Inc's  algorithm, which pushed eBay results lower in search rankings, slowing traffic.That slowdown was seen in June in a measure of transactions across eBay's core Marketplaces platform, known as gross merchandise value, with the growth rate falling to 7 percent from around a double-digit pace in previous months. ""We had a challenging first half of the year with several distractions,"" Bob Swan, the chief financial officer, told analysts on a conference call, noting that the cyber attack and the Google search engine changes ""had an immediate and dramatic impact.""Executives said eBay will spend more on measures to entice users back, including coupons, seller incentives and increased marketing.Several investment brokerages had downgraded their forecasts ahead of Wednesday's results. The second-quarter results and eBay's revenue outlook were roughly in line with those tempered expectations. Revenue rose to $4.37 billion for the quarter, compared with $3.88 billion a year ago; Wall Street had forecast revenue of $4.38 billion, on average.Payment volume leaped a better-than-expected 29 percent. Gross merchandise value grew 12 percent, in line with or slightly better than analysts' forecasts.Going forward, eBay will have to grapple with stiffening competition across its businesses. Marcus departed for Facebook's messaging team in June. The payments service faces a growing challenge from the likes of Amazon, which launched a recurring payments program in June. Google is also expected to delve further into this field.Brick-and-mortar retailers are investing to boost their online presence. EBay also has to fend off a growing coterie of fast-growing retail upstarts that focus on specific categories such as home and apparel.Longer term, industry analysts speculate that Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holdings Ltd IPO-BABA.N, which is going public this year in what could be the largest-ever tech IPO, is preparing to leverage its U.S. investments into a play for the U.S. retail arena, the world's largest.On Wednesday, eBay forecast third-quarter revenue of $4.3 billion to $4.4 billion, compared with expectations for $4.4 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.For the second quarter, it posted non-GAAP earnings per share of 69 cents, a penny better than forecasts for 68 cents.Shares in eBay rose slightly to $50.94 after hours, from a close at $50.70 on the Nasdaq.

They include a Russian national who was detained while vacationing in Spain, along with three others arrested in London, two in the United States and one in Canada. They were charged with involvement in a cybercrime ring that used stolen credit card numbers to purchase thousands of tickets to events, including concerts of Justin Timberlake and Jay-Z as well as games for sports teams including the Boston Red Sox and New York Giants, according to court documents unsealed Wednesday.The charges include money laundering, possession of stolen property and identity theft.

Amazon and Flipkart are joined in India's $13 billion e-commerce sector by marketplace Snapdeal, fashion e-tailer Jabong, and U.S. auctioneer eBay Inc.""With this additional investment of $2 billion, our team can continue to think big, innovate, and raise the bar for customers in India,"" Chief Executive Jeff Bezos said in a statement. ""At current scale and growth rates, India is on track to be our fastest country ever to a billion dollars in gross sales."" Amazon had not previously disclosed Indian investment plans.

The government is considering allowing foreign retailers to sell directly to customers. It recently took a step in that direction by allowing retailers to sell online products manufactured in India.Indian e-commerce is expanding at a compound annual growth rate of 34 percent, according to a joint report by consultants Digital-Commerce, the Internet Mobile Association of India and the Indian Market Research Bureau. That rate, however, is slower than in some other emerging nations such as China.Of the $13 billion market, travel services account for about 70 percent, according to consultancy Technopak. The type of goods sold through Amazon made up $1.6 billion of the total last year, according to researcher Forrester, and Technopak expects that figure to swell to $76 billion by 2021.By comparison, e-commerce sales in China are likely to surpass $180 billion this year, according to researcher eMarketer.

153,"  * Rocket seeks to raise about 750 mln euros via new share issue* Biggest European tech flotation since 2011* Six major shareholders pledge not to sell for 12 months* Rocket hopes to move to main Frankfurt bourse within 2 years* Graphic on biggest IPOs: link.reuters.com/dev88v   (Adds comments from conference call)By Emma ThomassonBERLIN, Sept 10 German venture capital firm Rocket Internet unveiled plans for a stock market listing that could value the company behind dozens of online start-ups at $6.5 billion, riding a wave of e-commerce flotations.Rocket's announcement on Wednesday of plans to raise about 750 million euros by selling new shares pits it against Europe's biggest online fashion firm Zalando and China's Alibaba IPO-BABA.N in the quest for investors this month.Alibaba's initial public offering is expected to cap the flurry as the biggest technology flotation ever, surpassing Facebook Inc's $16 billion listing in 2012, while Zalando's share sale would value it at about $5.8 billion.Berlin-based Rocket said in a statement its offer would consist solely of new shares and it would use the proceeds to fund growth by launching new businesses and providing more capital to its existing companies.A source with knowledge of the plans said Rocket planned to list a stake of about 15 percent, giving the group a total value of some 5 billion euros ($6.5 billion).Rocket Internet wants to replicate the success of Amazon.com Inc and Alibaba in markets the U.S. and Chinese e-commerce groups have yet to dominate, such as Africa, Latin America, Russia and other parts of Asia. Founded in 2007 by brothers Oliver, Alexander and Marc Samwer, Rocket is active in more than 100 countries, with sales of $1 billion in 2013 via e-commerce and online marketplaces for everything from taxis to meal deliveries.""We believe the Internet will play a transformational role in people's lives everywhere, particularly in emerging markets,"" said Oliver Samwer, chief executive, adding he was not concerned about competing with Alibaba for attention.""Ultimately we are a very unique story ... We believe investors will value the exposure that they can get through us to those fastest growing markets.""The Samwer brothers own 52.3 percent of the existing Rocket stock and hold 17 percent of Zalando, a company Rocket helped launch, so the two listings would make them billionaires.The Rocket businesses have succeeded in attracting a raft of high-profile investors - most recently securing 768 million euros from German service provider United Internet AG  and Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company. BIGGEST IN EUROPE The Rocket and Zalando listings are the biggest technology offerings in Germany since the bursting of the dot-com bubble more than a decade ago and the Rocket flotation would be the biggest in Europe since Russia's Yandex in 2011.Rocket is expected by analysts to appeal more to technology or emerging market funds, and Zalando to those looking for exposure to booming e-commerce in Europe. Zalando hopes to raise more than 500 million euros by listing a stake of 10-11 percent.""Rocket has an extremely interesting business model - they are taking quite simple business models which work well in Europe and launching them in emerging markets,"" said analyst Bjorn Gustafsson, analyst at brokerage Kepler Cheuvreux. The Samwer brothers have gained notoriety for cloning businesses pioneered in Silicon Valley in new markets, such as a German online auction site which they sold to eBay Inc  and Zalando, inspired by Amazon-owned fashion site Zappos.Rocket says it can launch a company within 100 days by drawing on expertise in areas such as finance, communications, marketing and business intelligence at its Berlin head office, helping it start an average of three to six new firms a year.Rocket plans to apply to list its shares in Frankfurt via the ""entry standard"", which requires less detailed financial information than the ""general"" or ""prime"" standard that Rocket hopes to reach within 18-24 months.Rocket has released limited financial details so far. Its top 10 e-commerce ventures - including fashion sites such as Lamoda in Russia and online furniture stores Home24 - had sales of 743 million euros in 2013 and an operating loss of 431.6 million, according to figures from major investor Kinnevik.Samwer said Rocket would publish more figures with its listing prospectus and would report results on a half-yearly basis in future, but said profits were not an immediate goal.""We are in a high growth phase and investing for growth ... we do have a clear path to long-term profitability,"" he said.Rocket's six main shareholders - including Sweden's Kinnevik  and the Samwer brothers' fund - would sign lock-up commitments not to sell their shares for at least 12 months.Kinnevik, a major investor in Rocket and Zalando, has seen its shares soar in the last year as investors sought exposure to e-commerce but analysts say it might lose some appeal now both are firms listing. The stock was down 0.3 percent at 1204 GMT.Last week, Rocket and Kinnevik announced plans to combine Rocket's five emerging market online fashion start-ups to create a new group they said was worth 2.7 billion euros, but Samwer declined to comment on speculation they might ultimately spin out that business from Rocket.Berenberg, JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley are joint coordinators of the Rocket share offer, while BofA Merrill Lynch, Citigroup and UBS are joint bookrunners.

166,"   By Deepa Seetharaman and Supantha Mukherjee  EBay Inc's agreement on Tuesday to spin off PayPal next year will give the unit more flexibility to strike deals in the rapidly evolving payments space as growth at the company's traditional e-commerce business slows.The surprise move is a huge about-face for eBay's leadership, including Chief Executive Officer John Donahoe, who resisted shareholder activist Carl Icahn's calls for a split earlier this year and led a months-long campaign to convince investors that eBay should remain intact.Icahn, eBay's sixth-largest shareholder, eventually backed off in April.

175,"   By Sarah McBride and Deepa Seetharaman | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO PayPal's biggest threat as it prepares to split from eBay (EBAY.O) next year may come from former employees who back a crop of new businesses serving shoppers who increasingly prefer to pay with mobile phones rather than personal computers.Though none of the new companies have the breadth of services offered by PayPal, which has more than 152 million users and deep ties to merchants like Home Depot both online and off, they are entering areas that the once-nimble online-payments service should own - but doesn't.Stripe, which helps merchants like Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and car-sharing service Lyft accept payments made by smart phones, is backed by PayPal co-founder and former chief executive Peter Thiel and former chief financial officer Roelof Botha. Thiel co-founded Founders Fund while Botha is a partner at Sequoia Capital.Square, a start-up that lets merchants accept credit-card payments over mobile phones and tablets with smaller fees than they had been paying via traditional credit-card networks, is also backed by Botha. Affirm, founded by Max Levchin, PayPal's former chief technology officer, offers split-second financing to shoppers.""The reality is that innovation of payments is moving so fast and PayPal is behind the curve on every dimension,"" said Keith Rabois, a former PayPal vice president who now backs both Stripe and Square through Khosla Ventures and sits on Affirm's board. ""I would expect that both (Stripe and Square) could be larger than PayPal."" PayPal's spinoff, announced on Tuesday, comes as Apple prepares to launch its own mobile wallet, Apple Pay, a move that payments experts said may fundamentally shift the payments landscape by letting customers pay for goods in stores by tapping their phones at a compatible point-of-sale system. The payments are authorized by their fingerprint and incorporate some aspects of Stripe.Ebay said that as an independent company PayPal will be able to compete in all kinds of electronic payments. ""PayPal's opportunities have never been greater – it is a rapidly growing global leader in digital payments and the most trusted digital wallet,"" an eBay spokeswoman said.  Some early PayPal employees, known as the PayPal ""mafia"" around Silicon Valley, think the company still has some zip. ""Most former senior PayPalians have been predicting some form of independence for a while,"" said Levchin, adding that PayPal would be a more formidable competitor as a separate company. Other PayPal mafiosi said the company's upcoming independence won't be enough to overcome its reputation as risk-averse and late to adopt new technology, hampering its ability to recruit top engineers. ""It's a necessary, but not necessarily sufficient step, for PayPal,"" Rabois said.The new competitors are poised to overtake PayPal when mobile transactions exceed those made using personal computers, analysts said.EBay bought payment gateway Braintree last year for about $800 million to bolster its presence on mobile devices, where PayPal has lagged other fast-growing startups. Braintree's Venmo app allows consumers to make payments on their mobile phones and tablets. The deal may have come too late to compete with Stripe, founded in 2010 and now valued at $1.75 billion, which is now considered the leader in mobile transaction payments. General Catalyst, a venture fund that has backed Stripe since its founding, announced a program Tuesday that makes investments of up to $500,000 in start-ups that are built on top of Stripe, including Baremetrics, a company that helps businesses analyze data they get from Stripe. These upstarts have taken payment in directions PayPal was slow to try. Stripe, for example, pioneered a system where the user never leaves the merchant's page to pay, compared with the PayPal method of drawing users temporarily to its own site to log in. Stripe's technology, adopted by companies such as Lyft and delivery service Postmates, is especially effective for companies that use mobile apps.Stripe is also working with Alipay, the payments unit affiliated with Alibaba Group, the Chinese online juggernaut. Amazon (AMZN.O) and Google (GOOG.O) also beefing up their own payment services.""They have a lot of ground to make up,"" John Collison, co-founder of Stripe, said of PayPal. ""Maybe they can, maybe they can't."" (Reporting by Sarah McBride and Deepa Seetharaman.

178,"   By Valerie Volcovici | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON More than 80 environmental, labor and civic groups on Tuesday urged eBay Inc to end its association with the political group the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), weeks after Google Inc abruptly left ALEC over its views on climate change.Civic groups such as Common Cause and the Environmental Defense Fund and unions including the International Brotherhood of Teamsters wrote to the e-commerce company's management asking it to reconsider involvement in ALEC because of what they called its ""extreme agenda.""ALEC is a coalition of about 2,000 state lawmakers and corporations that promotes free markets and limited government. It often drafts legislation for states to adopt, a handy service for often resource-strapped state lawmakers.  ALEC did not respond to requests to comment.      Critics fault ALEC for promoting measures to deny the existence of climate change, defund public services, oppose  Internet neutrality and limit workers’ protections.Google Chief Executive Eric Schmidt said in September that his company wanted out because ALEC was “literally lying” about climate change.  Yahoo Inc, Facebook Inc and Yelp Inc left ALEC soon after.“The Google announcement made it difficult for some of these companies to hide in the shadows anymore,” said Nick Surgey, director of the Center for Media and Democracy, a watchdog group. Companies such as Microsoft Corp and Google have touted renewable energy programs or voluntary carbon emission targets, contrary to some of the policies promoted by ALEC.Microsoft ended its membership in August, citing changing priorities and budget issues.

179,"   By Valerie Volcovici | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Oct 7 More than 80 environmental, labor and civic groups on Tuesday urged eBay Inc to end its association with the political group the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), weeks after Google Inc  abruptly left ALEC over its views on climate change.Civic groups such as Common Cause and the Environmental Defense Fund and unions including the International Brotherhood of Teamsters wrote to the e-commerce company's management asking it to reconsider involvement in ALEC because of what they called its ""extreme agenda.""ALEC is a coalition of about 2,000 state lawmakers and corporations that promotes free markets and limited government. It often drafts legislation for states to adopt, a handy service for often resource-strapped state lawmakers.ALEC did not respond to requests to comment.Critics fault ALEC for promoting measures to deny the existence of climate change, defund public services, oppose  Internet neutrality and limit workers' protections.Google Chief Executive Eric Schmidt said in September that his company wanted out because ALEC was ""literally lying"" about climate change.  Yahoo Inc, Facebook Inc and Yelp Inc left ALEC soon after. ""The Google announcement made it difficult for some of these companies to hide in the shadows anymore,"" said Nick Surgey, director of the Center for Media and Democracy, a watchdog group.Companies such as Microsoft Corp and Google have touted renewable energy programs or voluntary carbon emission targets, contrary to some of the policies promoted by ALEC.Microsoft ended its membership in August, citing changing priorities and budget issues.

It added that investors would likely welcome a split into what Third Point calls MatureCo and GrowthCo.Loeb, who has been making more activist bets and is known to lob sharply worded directives at underperforming chief executives, called Amgen CEO Bob Bradway open-minded and receptive to the idea of a split. Amgen, the world's largest biotech company by sales, needs to improve its research and development evaluation, Third Point said, adding that recent cost cuts did not even scratch the surface.Amgen said it appreciates the perspectives of all of its shareholders, including Third Point.""The board and management continually assess Amgen's strategic priorities - and, when appropriate, take action - to set the best path forward to increase shareholder value,"" the company said.

192,"  (Adds Breakingviews link)By Deepa SeetharamanSAN FRANCISCO Oct 23 Amazon.com Inc's  sales projections for the crucial holiday quarter disappointed Wall Street and third-quarter results missed forecasts, sending the online retailer's shares 9 percent lower on Thursday.After an unusually busy first half of the year that saw the online retailer spend on developing everything from mobile phones and Hollywood-style production to grocery deliveries, investors were ready to see it curtail its ambitions and start delivering sustainable profits.But not only did it post a much larger loss than expected, Amazon also projected 7 to 18 percent revenue growth over the busiest shopping period of the year, a far cry from the 20 percent-plus pace that had convinced investors to overlook its persistent lack of profit in the past.""That kind of takes the topline growth story off the table. And now they've got to deliver on profit margins,"" said Rob Plaza, senior analyst at Key Private Bank.""Because of all that money they need to spend to drive growth, it becomes an expensive proposition."" Thursday's after-hours share losses wipe more than $15 billion off of Amazon's market value. The stock had already been down 13 percent since Amazon's last quarterly results announcement in July, when it also missed targets and ignited a debate about its free spending ways.Some analysts fear that the U.S. holiday shopping season, the biggest quarter for most retailers, might turn out weaker than anticipated.Amazon projected on Thursday net sales of between $27.3 billion and $30.3 billion for the holiday quarter, lagging the $30.89 billion analysts had expected on average. Chief Financial Officer Tom Szkutak told reporters a stronger dollar had reduced its fourth-quarter revenue forecast by about 2.5 percentage points. A stronger dollar means overseas revenue translates to less in the home currency.He added that Amazon sales in Japan in the third-quarter failed to recover from their second-quarter decline.The earnings report comes about a week after e-commerce rival eBay Inc trimmed its own full-year revenue outlook due in part to the stronger U.S. dollar. For the just-finished third quarter, Amazon missed on virtually every metric that Wall Street tracks.Its third-quarter net loss widened to $437 million or 95 cents per share in the third quarter, from $41 million a 9 cents a year ago.

Son's global ambitions flared into public view last year when SoftBank bought No. 3 U.S. mobile carrier Sprint Corp for $21.6 billion.The Snapdeal purchase comes as international investors hunt deals in online retail in India, which has the world's third-largest Internet user base but where e-commerce is still relatively underdeveloped. For cash-rich SoftBank, owner of a third of newly listed Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, the move is the latest in a series of deals designed to counter sluggish growth at home.""I have a strong willingness to invest more like $10 billion in the next 10 years,"" Son said in an interview on Indian CNBC after his company announced plans to buy in Snapdeal, which connects small businesses with customers in an online marketplace. ""I strongly believe that Snapdeal has the potential to be like the Alibaba of India.""In a separate deal announced on Tuesday, SoftBank said it will lead a $210 million investment round with existing investors in ANI Technologies Pvt. Ltd, which owns a mobile application for taxi bookings that competes with the likes of Uber. SoftBank didn't disclose how big a stake it will have in Snapdeal, which will use funds to expand operations to compete with bigger, free-spending rivals Flipkart.com and Amazon.com .The company did say it will become the biggest investor in Snapdeal, where sales of everything from clothes to computers have brought in around 25 million registered users and 50,000-plus merchants, attracting international shareholders like e-commerce operator eBay Inc and investment firm BlackRock Inc.One person with knowledge of the deal told Reuters SoftBank will own about 30 percent of New Delhi-based Snapdeal, buying new shares in the firm, valuing all of Snapdeal at around $2 billion. Snapdeal declined to comment on the terms of the deal.""SoftBank is a major investor in the internet space and them putting in a large sum of money validates the growth of Indian e-commerce,"" said Niren Shah, managing director at venture capital firm Norwest Venture Partners. FLIPKART, AMAZON PUSH Kunal Bahl, co-founder and chief executive of Snapdeal, said the two sides were quick to negotiate a deal, taking just three weeks. ""Most of the capital investment we're going to make is in technology,"" he said in an interview, signalling about $250 million will be spent next year.Bahl said the company plans to open a Bangalore innovation centre in two weeks, and Snapdeal was planning to hire about 500 engineers.Pressure had been growing on Snapdeal to raise funds to compete as online retail surges in India, with local industry leader Flipkart raising $1 billion in July, and global e-commerce giant Amazon.com pledging to invest a further $2 billion in its India unit.The SoftBank investment is in line with the $600 million-$650 million sources told Reuters Snapdeal had been seeking, and is the biggest investment by a single investor in the e-commerce sector in India. With this round of investment, Snapdeal, co-founded by Bahl and Rohit Bansal four years ago, has raised about $1 billion this calendar year. The company said it plans to use the money to ramp up technology and supply chain management systems, and add order fulfilment centres to 30 cities. The company currently has 40 fulfilment centres in 15 cities.Snapdeal will also look at making three or four bolt-on acquisitions in the coming few months specifically in the area of mobile technology and set up an incubation centre to work with start-up businesses in the mobile technology space, the company said.CEO Bahl, who has said he also wants Snapdeal.com to become ""the Alibaba of India"", told Reuters in September that the company was focusing on improving its technology platform so that it could connect more small-scale enterprises with buyers. Snapdeal plans to expand its merchant base to 1 million in the next three years.ARORA RISING Both deals were negotiated under newly appointed SoftBank Vice chairman Nikesh Arora, reflecting the company's recent aggressive overseas expansion.""India has the third-largest internet user base in the world, but a relatively small online market currently. This situation means India has, with better, faster and cheaper Internet access, a big growth potential,"" Arora, a former Google executive, said in a statement.Arora will be joining both Snapdeal and ANI's boards as part of the investment, SoftBank said.The India growth plan rolled out by SoftBank on Tuesday doesn't indicate the company will take its eye off other investment openings.Earlier this month it announced plans to lead a $100 million investment in Indonesian e-commerce giant PT Tokopedia.

But the hostile bid soon brought scrutiny from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which began looking at the potential deal in August.Jana added more than 12 million shares of eBay, bringing its total stake to 13.063 million shares.EBay this year bowed to pressure from activist investor Carl Icahn to spin off its PayPal payments service. The action is expected to give PayPal more flexibility to make deals in the rapidly evolving payments sector as growth in eBay's traditional e-commerce business slows. Jana declined to comment. Messages to eBay and Valeant requesting comment were not immediately returned.Rosenstein's fund also increased its stakes in Groupon Inc  by 10 percent, for a total of 51.68 million shares, and increased its stake in Walgreen Co, by 12.5 percent, for a total 12.5 million shares. In September Rosenstein won a seat on the Walgreen board.Also in the third quarter, Jana took a new stake, of 300,000 shares, in Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba Group Holding Ltd  and a new stake, of 842,268 shares, in fast-food company McDonald's Corp.Jana became the latest among activist investors - those sensing the opportunity to help turn around struggling businesses - to focus on McDonald's.

""As always, our focus is on maximizing shareholder value through initiatives that ultimately benefit our customers.""After Don Thompson became chief executive in July 2012, business at McDonald's, which outperformed its peers during the recession, began to slow.The 13F filings with regulators made by Jana and other funds provide a window onto the strategies of some of the world's biggest investors. But the view is limited.

210,"  HONG KONG Jan 14 China has allowed foreign investors to fully own e-commerce companies in Shanghai's free trade zone as part of a pilot scheme, the official Xinhua news agency said on Wednesday, citing the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology.Foreign investors previously required a Chinese joint-venture partner to operate an e-commerce firm in the highly competitive market. The pilot scheme could provide an easier route for overseas companies to enter the ring and fight for a slice of one of the world's biggest e-commerce markets.Telecommunications authorities in Shanghai will regulate the scheme and the foreign investors, according to a Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) statement reported by Xinhua. Since the launch of the free trade zone (FTZ) in September 2013, policy makers have trumpeted reforms and relaxed regulations to boost China's e-commerce industry, dominated by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.But foreign e-commerce firms have struggled in China against the likes of Alibaba and No.2 JD.com Inc. Amazon.com Inc  only holds a sliver of the market, while eBay Inc  pulled out of the country in 2006 after a long and bitter battle with Alibaba. In August, Amazon said it would set up shop in the Shanghai free trade zone, hoping to benefit from less stringent trade regulations to sell a wider range of products in the country. Going in the opposite direction, Alibaba has been making forays into the United States, as it looks to link up American retailers and merchants with Chinese consumers.At the same time, it has made moves to assure regulators of its good intentions. Alibaba agreed to prevent the sale of 15 illegal or dangerous toys in the United States, the country's Consumer Product Safety Commission said on Tuesday.

217,"  (Adds background, Kingsborough quotes)SAN FRANCISCO Feb 4 Paypal executive Don Kingsborough, who helped orchestrate the payments company's move into physical retail stores, stepped down in January, the company said on Wednesday.His departure, which tech blog Re/code first reported, comes as the company competes with the likes of fast-growing startup Square to get its payments system adopted in more retail chains across the United States.PayPal, which is slated to split from eBay Inc  later this year, will keep testing and investing in various in-store payments systems, eBay spokeswoman Amanda Miller said in a statement. Kingsborough was instrumental in PayPal's attempts to push innovations such as in-store ordering and pickup and physical-checkout payment at chains ranging from Home Depot Inc  to Jamba Juice. But the company increasingly has had to contend with rivals such as Square, which is popular with smaller businesses, and Apple Inc's Apple Pay. Online commerce foe Amazon.com Inc is also beginning to explore in-store payments.It is unclear how much progress PayPal has made on that front. eBay said it enjoys ""a strong foothold in offline retail,"" but analysts say it has been difficult for the tech companies vying for checkout space to contend with the simple convenience of debit or credit cards. eBay did not say why Kingsborough decided to step down or where he might be going. In an interview with Re/code, he said, ""I think we were able to move the needle, but I have to say I leave a little frustrated in that I wish we as an executive team would have done more.""His departure comes as eBay prepares to lay off some 7 percent of its workforce, or 2,400 jobs, including PayPal employees, before the two companies split in the second half of 2015.

220,"   By Svea Herbst-Bayliss and Sam Forgione | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Feb 17 Top U.S. hedge fund management firms, including David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital and Philippe Laffont's Coatue Management, reduced their stakes in Apple Inc  during the fourth quarter, ahead of the iPhone maker's strong rally in 2015, according to regulatory filings.Apple was a big winner in 2014, with its shares rising nearly 38 percent. The company's stock is up more than 16 percent year to date and reached an intraday record high of $129.45 per share. Last week, its stock market value rose above $700 billion, bigger than Switzerland's gross domestic product.Although Apple is the biggest position in Coatue Management's portfolio, the firm sold 1.7 million shares at the end of the quarter, or more than 15 percent of its stake, leaving it with 8.9 million shares, according to a regulatory filing on Tuesday.In a filing on Friday, Greenlight said it cut Apple holdings by 6.2 percent to 8.6 million shares during the quarter.Eric Mandelblatt's Soroban Capital Partners sold 4.3 million Apple call options, liquidating the fund's position. And David Tepper's Appaloosa Management hedge fund said it had dissolved its stake in Apple, while Leon Cooperman's Omega Advisors sold 808,000 Apple shares to own 383,790 shares at the end of the fourth quarter.Last week, billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn said the technology company's shares should be trading at $216 apiece, equivalent to a market capitalization of $1.26 trillion.The actions by Greenlight and Coatue were revealed in quarterly disclosures of manager stock holdings, known as 13F filings, with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. They are of great interest to investors trying to divine a pattern in what savvy traders are selling and buying.But relying on the filings to develop an investment strategy comes with some peril because the disclosures are backward-looking and come out 45 days after the end of each quarter.Still, the filings offer a glimpse into what hedge fund managers saw as opportunities to make money on the long side.The filings do not disclose short positions, or bets that a stock will fall in price. As a result, the public filings do not always present a complete picture of a management firm's stock holdings.The following are some of the hot stocks and sectors in which hedge fund managers either took new positions or exited existing positions in the fourth quarter.ACTAVIS PLC Coatue Management opened a new position, buying 964,155 shares, as drugmaker Actavis won a high-stakes battle to buy Botox maker Allergan Inc.Daniel Loeb's Third Point upped its stake by 20 percent to 3.5 million shares. But Neil Chriss' Hutchin Hill cut its position by 13 percent, selling 17,201 shares to own 28.3 million at the end of the quarter.Omega Advisors upped its stake by 237,100 shares to own 943,572 shares.AGRIUM INC Activist investor ValueAct bought 2.9 million shares of the Canadian fertilizer producer to own 8.2 million at the end of the quarter. AMGEN INC The biotechnology company is being pressured by hedge fund investor Daniel Loeb to break itself apart.Alex Denner, who now runs Sarissa Capital after working for  Carl Icahn, upped his stake by 165 percent to 50.6 million shares.BAKER HUGHES INC Farallon Capital Management bought 3.5 million shares, a new position, of the oilfield services company, which will be bought by rival Halliburton Co.Activist fund ValueAct Capital took an even bigger new position, buying 14.9 million shares. ValueAct also took a 20.9 million-share stake in Halliburton.Omega Advisors took a new stake in Baker Hughes of 65,500 shares and sold its entire 1.9 million-share stake in Halliburton.BANK OF AMERICA CORP John Burbank's Passport Capital, which made money early this year by betting against energy exchange-traded funds, added a position in Bank of America, buying 2.8 million shares. CITIGROUP Leon Cooperman's Omega Advisors cut its stake in the bank by 915,200 shares to 4.2 million shares.EBAY INC Jon Jacobson's Highfields Capital upped its stake in online commerce company eBay by 39 percent by adding 1.8 million shares to own 6.5 million at the quarter's end.

231,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, April 01 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has maintained the 'A-' long-term  ratings for eBay, Inc. (eBay) on Rating Watch Negative in anticipation of the  PayPal separation in the form of a tax-free spin-off in the second half of 2015.  Fitch also has affirmed the short-term ratings at 'F2'.  The ratings affect approximately $10.5 billion of debt, including the $3 billion  revolving credit facility (RCF). A full list of current ratings follows at the  end of this release. This release and the maintenance of the Watch is in  accordance with Fitch's guidelines related to the review of Rating Watch status  following Fitch's placement of the company's rating on Rating Watch Negative on  Oct. 1, 2014.  Fitch believes eBay's operating profile could support the 'A-' rating, given  solid secular growth prospects and strong profit margins and free cash flow  (FCF). However, the Negative Watch reflects the potential for more aggressive  financial policies after the separation, given the lack of strategic rationale  for strong investment grade ratings.  Fitch believes eBay would have meaningfully greater financial flexibility at a  mid- to high-'BBB' for increased shareholder returns and to make larger  acquisitions amidst current operating challenges and intensifying competition. Pro forma for the separation, eBay will consist of the Marketplace and  Enterprise segments, although the company is exploring a potential sale or  initial public offering (IPO) of Enterprise. As a result, Fitch estimates  operating EBITDA will decline by roughly $1.5 billion to $3.5 billion and eBay  currently plans to retain all $7.6 billion of existing debt. As a result, Fitch estimates total leverage (total debt to operating EBITDA)  will increase to 2.2x from 1.5x for 2014. With expectations for continued  pressure from activist shareholders for robust stock buybacks and faster FCF  growth outside the U.S., Fitch believes it unlikely eBay will commit to  returning and maintaining total leverage at or below 2x.  eBay plans to capitalize both businesses for investment grade ratings, including  a $2 billion net cash position at eBay and $5 billion net cash position at  PayPal. Fitch expects to resolve the Negative Watch or provide expected ratings  upon confirmation of eBay's financial policies, ultimate capital structure and  liquidity profile.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Strengths include: --Leading e-commerce platform with strong brand recognition and technology; --Significant number of active accounts provides substantial customer  diversification; --High profitability and low capital intensity resulting in strong and  consistent FCF generation; --Solid secular growth from increasing e-commerce penetration, particularly in  international markets with comparatively lower e-commerce penetration and rapid  mobile adoption.  Concerns include: --Expectations for more aggressive post-separation financial policies, which  could be exacerbated by the company's significant offshore cash balances and FCF  generation. --Potential dis-synergies or shift in economics between Marketplaces and PayPal  post-spin. A material increase in PayPal's take rate could adversely affect  eBay's profitability since PayPal currently represents 80% of the transactions  conducted on eBay. eBay intends to put in place arm's-length, long-term  operating agreements to minimize dis-synergies post spin;  --Challenges gaining e-commerce platform traction in fastest growing  international markets; --Challenges accelerating new customer additions following Google's search  engine optimization (SEO) changes and the cyber-attack-driven password reset in  2014. RATINGS SENSITIVITIES Negative rating actions could occur if Fitch expects: --eBay's post-separation total leverage will remain above 2x, consistent with  more aggressive financial policies;  --Normalized FCF to total adjusted debt will approach the 10% level, from a  combination of higher debt levels and sustained operating weakness in  Marketplaces. Fitch believes positive rating actions are unlikely, given continued activist  shareholder pressures and in the absence of management's commitment to debt  reduction and a more conservative capital structure.  As of Dec. 31, 2014, Fitch believes eBay's liquidity was strong and supported  by: --$6.3 billion of cash and equivalents;  --$8.3 billion of non-restricted and non-equity short- and long-term  investments;  --An undrawn $3 billion RCF expiring Nov. 22, 2016 that fully supports the $2  billion commercial paper (CP) program, under which there were no borrowings as  of Dec. 31, 2014;  --Annual FCF of roughly $4 billion.  Of the $14.6 billion of cash and cash equivalents and short- and long-term  non-restricted and non-equity investments, $10.1 billion was located outside the  U.S. and would be subject to tax liabilities if repatriated.  Total debt was $7.6 billion and consisted of; --$600 million 1.625% notes due October 2015;  --$250 million 0.7% notes due July 2015;  --$1 billion 1.35% notes due July 2017; --$450 million Floating Rate notes due July 2017; --$400 million Floating Rate notes due January 2019; --$1.1 billion 2.2% notes due August 2019; --$500 million 3.25% notes due October 2020; --$750 million 2.875% notes due August 2021;  --$1 billion 2.6% notes due July 2022; --$750 million 3.45% notes due August 2024; and --$750 million of 4.0% notes due July 2042. KEY ASSUMPTIONS --Low single digit FX-neutral revenue growth for Marketplaces in the near-term,  driven by weak first performance as the company rebuilds its new user base  resulting in the resumption of revenue growth in the second half.  --Mid-teen FX-neutral Payments revenue growth from increased ubiquity and  transaction payment value (TPV) growth. --Mid-single digit FX-neutral revenue growth for Enterprise, driven by  increasing e-commerce penetration.  --Profitability will be constrained by increased investments driving new users  in Marketplaces and increased ubiquity in Payments, despite the company's  recently announced headcount reductions.  --Fitch uses available cash and domestic FCF to exhaust the $3 billion  outstanding share repurchase program in 2015. --Fitch's rating case assumes 2015 debt maturities are refinanced. Fitch maintains the following ratings on Rating Watch Negative: --Long-term IDR 'A-'; --Senior unsecured revolving credit facility 'A-';  --Senior unsecured notes 'A-'; Fitch affirms the following ratings:  --Short-term IDR at 'F2';  --$2 billion CP program at 'F2'.

234,"   By Svea Herbst-Bayliss | BOSTON, April 9  BOSTON, April 9 Tactics that activist investors say will benefit a company's shareholders may also raise the risk for the firm's  creditors, a leading credit rating agency warned on Thursday.Investors who push companies to consider tactics to boost stock prices via share buybacks, spin-offs, purchase of another company or other means also raise anxiety about a change in corporate strategy, Moody's Investors Services said in its annual report on shareholder activism.""Often these changes are aimed at carving out value for shareholders and this may come at bondholders' expense,"" Chris Plath, vice president and senior analyst at Moody's, said in an interview. For example if activist investors win a seat on the board of a company, as Third Point's Daniel Loeb did last year at auction house Sotheby's, there is often increased uncertainty about a company's strategic direction, Plath said. ""If Bill Ackman or Dan Loeb get a seat on the board, there is an entirely new board room dynamic,"" he said.Plath pointed to two examples where Moody's has acted. Only days after activist hedge fund Casablanca Capital in July won six seats on the board of iron-ore producer Cliffs Natural Resources, Moody's cut the company's debt to speculative from investment grade.Similarly when e-commerce company eBay Inc last year took investor Carl Icahn's suggestion to spin off its PayPal subsidiary, Moody's put the company on review for a downgrade, saying it would be smaller and consequently have a weaker credit profile. Activists have flexed their muscle in the last years, leading high profile battles at companies including Darden Restaurants, Allergan, and more recently at General Motors and DuPont. Moody's, like other researchers, expect the number of campaigns to rise.""The bulk of corporate governance is played out between companies and their shareholders and bondholders are, for better or worse, only along for the ride,"" Plath said.(Reporting by Svea Herbst-Bayliss; Editing by Steve Orlofsky)",2015-04-09,EBAY,"Thu Apr 9, 2015 | 12:05am EDT",Investor activism may be hard on corporate creditors -Moody's,http://www.reuters.com//article/hedgefunds-activists-creditors-idUSL2N0X522320150409?type=companyNews
235,"   By Paul Carsten | BEIJING, April 15  BEIJING, April 15 JD.com Inc, China's No. 2 e-commerce player, on Wednesday launched its JD Worldwide cross-border online shopping platform, a challenger to Alibaba Group Holding Ltd's Tmall Global service.JD Worldwide will allow Chinese shoppers to buy imports from U.S. firms such as Nike Inc, Starbucks Corp and Ocean Spray Cranberries Inc, as well as products from countries like Australia, France, Germany, Japan, South Korea, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, JD.com said in a press release.Overseas suppliers will provide more than 1,200 brands, without those merchants requiring a presence in China.The venture adds to a host of online retail rivals for Alibaba and Amazon.com Inc catering to fears about the quality and safety of Chinese goods after a number of scares, and comes on the back of a Chinese government push to promote e-commerce and relax import restrictions. But JD.com still trails far behind Alibaba in Chinese e-commerce. Alibaba's high profile since its record-breaking $25 billion U.S. listing in September is a huge lure for brands looking to enter or raise their presence in China, which some analysts estimate as the world's biggest online shopping market.""Imported goods have always been huge sellers on JD.com, and this massively expands the range of products available to Chinese consumers,"" said Leo Li, who oversees JD Worldwide, in an e-mail to Reuters. Using China's e-commerce free trade zones and the firm's own logistics network, JD.com can ""offer international brands a direct channel to Chinese consumers with preferential tax rates to make prices highly competitive,"" he said, adding that JD.com would also do marketing for its overseas partners.""We are currently providing free advertising so that they get good traffic and don't become ghost stores. We're playing the long game with our partners."" JD.com, backed by Alibaba arch-rival Tencent Holdings Ltd , also said it launched with eBay Inc a programme to allow Chinese shoppers to buy select goods from U.S. eBay sellers.A spokeswoman for eBay confirmed the partnership.Shares of JD.com, which markets itself as a seller of authentic goods, have risen 44 percent since the beginning of the year. Alibaba's stock price, on the other hand, has fallen 18 percent in the same period.Analysts have expressed concern over counterfeits on the world's largest e-commerce firm's platforms, as well as lacklustre earnings and investor excitement wearing off after the initial public offering.

236,"   By Devika  Krishna Kumar and Kshitiz Goliya  E-commerce company eBay Inc reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit as revenue surged from its payments business that includes PayPal, which the company said would be spun off in the third quarter. Revenue from eBay's payments business rose 14 percent to $2.11 billion in the first quarter, accounting for nearly half of its total revenue.  EBay's shares rose 5 percent in extended trading on Wednesday.""The upside all came from PayPal,"" Benchmark Co analyst Daniel Kurnos said.EBay has relied heavily on its payments business to offset sluggishness in its marketplace business, which includes its core global e-commerce platform ebay.com. Increasing competition and slowing customer additions have hurt the company's marketplace business, which reported a 4 percent fall in quarterly revenue. PayPal said in April it would continue charging eBay merchants less than it does other merchants and the two companies would stay interdependent for the next five years. The business has benefited from a surge in payments using mobile devices as customers increasingly use their smartphones and tablets for online shopping. PayPal's mobile payment transactions, which account for nearly one-third of its total transactions, rose more than 40 percent.Average transactions per PayPal account rose to 23 in the quarter from 21, said PayPal President Daniel Schulman, who is set to be appointed the chief executive of the spunoff company.

237,"  * First-qtr profit 77 cents/share vs est. 70 cents* Revenue from payments business surges 14 pct* Shares up 5 pct after market   (Adds forecast, details, analyst comments; updates shares)By Devika  Krishna Kumar and Kshitiz GoliyaApril 22 E-commerce company eBay Inc  reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit as revenue surged from its payments business that includes PayPal, which the company said would be spun off in the third quarter.Revenue from eBay's payments business rose 14 percent to $2.11 billion in the first quarter, accounting for nearly half of its total revenue.EBay's shares rose 5 percent in extended trading on Wednesday.""The upside all came from PayPal,"" Benchmark Co analyst Daniel Kurnos said. EBay has relied heavily on its payments business to offset sluggishness in its marketplace business, which includes its core global e-commerce platform ebay.com.Increasing competition and slowing customer additions have hurt the company's marketplace business, which reported a 4 percent fall in quarterly revenue.PayPal said in April it would continue charging eBay merchants less than it does other merchants and the two companies would stay interdependent for the next five years.The business has benefited from a surge in payments using mobile devices as customers increasingly use their smartphones and tablets for online shopping. PayPal's mobile payment transactions, which account for nearly one-third of its total transactions, rose more than 40 percent.Average transactions per PayPal account rose to 23 in the quarter from 21, said PayPal President Daniel Schulman, who is set to be appointed the chief executive of the spunoff company.EBay forecast revenue of $4.40 billion-$4.50 billion for the second quarter, below the average analyst estimate of $4.57 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.The company's full-year revenue forecast of $18.35 billion-$18.85 billion also missed analysts' expectations of $18.96 billion, which EBay blamed on a strong dollar.

248,"   By Lionel Laurent | LONDON  LONDON Scotland-based investment strategist Russell Napier gave up his high-powered finance job as a star analyst bankrolled by a big-name broker in order to go it alone last year.Fifty-year-old Napier now sells written research, phone calls and meetings directly through an online marketplace he helped to launch in 2014. It's called ERIC and it allows investment professionals to bid for research as if it were eBay. ERIC is one of several new platforms inspired by regulators' efforts to narrow the scope for conflicts of interest in financial trading. It aims to reinvigorate a research industry that has long relied on fund managers' customers paying an all-in commission on every trade. These commissions, worth about 2.5 billion euros annually in Europe, cover not only the execution of the deal but research and other services, prompting criticism that clients aren't sure what they're paying for or how impartial the trading advice is.With commissions under threat, the response of more than 40 research providers has been to sell their wares through ERIC. Users can bid for a phone call with Gluskin Sheff strategist David Rosenberg, a research note from broker Mainfirst or a chat with an analyst at a rate of $375 per hour. Around 1,200 fund managers have signed up, according to Napier.""Any seller can put up any research they want, at any price they like,"" said Napier. ""You are buying analysts' time ... It's the cutting edge of capitalism.""ERIC is not alone. Paris-based Alphametry plans to sell trading ideas offered by anyone from bank analysts to academics, U.S.-based Airex offers financial apps and reports and London-based RSRCHXchange offers a further independent option. The appeal of these new distribution channels is much enhanced by the expectation that European regulations due to come into force in 2017 will require more fund managers to pay for research using hard cash. Two-thirds of investors surveyed by consultancy TABB Group said new rules would mean they spend less on research. Neil Scarth of Frost Consulting expects brokers' research budgets to fall to $3.4 billion by 2017 from around $4.5 billion in 2015.For upstart platforms like ERIC, this expected squeeze is a  chance to reinvent a market that has grown stale: data from research tracker Mereus suggests less than 6 percent of most research notes received by e-mail are opened. By forcing investors to count the cost of research, only the best analysts should be rewarded. ""Less research will be produced ... But more bad research will be lost than good,"" said Frost Consulting's Scarth.INCREASED COSTS The proposed rules have yet to be finalised and not all fund managers welcome the changes. Some say increasing regulatory costs will put smaller funds at a disadvantage and that European investors overall will have less access to research than those in the United States, where no changes are due. But executives at several bulge-bracket investment banks and brokers told Reuters that different packages were being negotiated with clients, from pay-as-you-go to all-in subscriptions.""Research providers will win for bespoke analysis and original 'alpha' (added-value) ideas,"" said Adam Toms, European head of Nomura-owned brokerage Instinet. ""There could be a great deal of competition to access the best super-league of analysts.""For analysts who have made their name, like Napier, there may be more money in going solo. For relative unknowns without a bank brand to promote them, it could get a lot harder.""Market forces must be allowed to set the price of research ...And it is the reputation of the author that will set that price,"" said Alphametry head Fabrice Bouland.

254,"   By MacDonald Dzirutwe | HARARE  HARARE On online auction site eBay, a 100 trillion Zimbabwean dollar note is a collector's item fetching up to $35, a small fortune  compared with the 40 U.S. cents on offer from the central bank as it seeks to officially bury the worthless currency.The unloved Zimbabwean dollar, ravaged by hyperinflation that peaked at 500 billion percent in 2008, ceased to be legal tender on Friday as the southern African country switches fully to the U.S. dollar.The central bank says citizens have until September to exchange their remaining quadrillions of local dollars for a few greenbacks.But economists say 90 percent of the economy has been based on the U.S. dollar since 2009, so few people are expected to make a beeline to banks to cash in old notes - especially as they could get a far better deal elsewhere.""I think this is a waste of time. I would rather sell the money to tourists,"" said Shadreck Gutuza, a former currency trader who now buys and sells used cars from Japan. ""Most people either burned that money or dumped it,"" he told Reuters.On eBay a seller was offering a hundred 50 trillion Zimbabwean dollar notes for $1,000. Zimbabwe's hyperinflation was considered by the International Monetary Fund as the worst for any country not at war, and the 100 trillion dollar Zimbabwean dollar note was the single largest known note to be printed by any central bank.Tourists are known to pay up to $20 for a single note in the resort town of Victoria Falls.""I buy a 100 trillion note for $10 if they are many, but they have to be clean,"" said an Indian trader who sells fabrics in downtown Harare. The government has set aside $20 million to mop up Zimbabwean dollar notes and to compensate customers who had local currency bank balances before March 31, 2009.Bank accounts with balances of up to 175 quadrillion Zimbabwean dollars - that's 175,000,000,000,000,000  - will be paid $5. Those with higher balances will get a rate of $1 to 35 quadrillion Zimbabwean dollars.

261,"   By Mari Saito | SAN FRANCISCO, June 24  SAN FRANCISCO, June 24 Amazon.com Inc  and eBay Inc sharply cut the number of Confederate flag products on their sites a day after vowing to remove them, but in a sign of the difficulty of removing controversial content, Nazi-era memorabilia are listed on both sites.EBay specifically bans their sale while Amazon bans the sale of ""products that promote or glorify hatred, violence, racial, sexual or religious intolerance or promote organizations with such views.""It is difficult to enforce a complete ban on controversial products, analysts said, because of technological hurdles in flagging and pulling down banned items. ""For Amazon and eBay, it's a question of scale. eBay has had to work on everything from Nazi memorabilia to counterfeit jewelry and one of the hardest parts at their scale is to look at keywords, identify sellers with problems and flag issues,"" said Derek Bambauer, a professor at the University of Arizona who specializes in Internet law.Amazon, which on Tuesday had listed nearly 30,000 items in a search for ""Confederate flag"", had almost nothing for sale with the flag late afternoon Wednesday. Dylann Roof, the white 21-year-old charged with nine counts of murder in connection with the killings at a historically black church in South Carolina last week, posed with a Confederate flag in photos posted online.The shooting has spawned a nationwide movement to eradicate symbols of the Confederacy from public spaces, license plates and retail stores, with both Wal-Mart Stores Inc and Sears Holdings Corp stopping sales. Ebay's Tuesday listing of 1,377 items had shrunk to 466. The company said it uses a combination of automated and manual steps to flag and remove problematic listings, and it did not say why so many items remained.Another challenge to keeping controversial products off the sites involves the guidelines the companies use. Despite its general ban on Nazi memorabilia, eBay list certain items from that era, which a representative said recognized the historical significance of World War II.A search by Reuters found numerous coins and stamps from that era available for sale, including some bearing the image of Adolf Hitler or Nazi swastikas.

268,"   By Liana B. Baker and Greg Roumeliotis | July 9  July 9 Private equity firm Thomas H. Lee Partners LP is in advanced talks to acquire the enterprise business of eBay Inc for close to $1 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.Thomas H. Lee has so far outbid other parties in the auction for the business, though disagreements over price persist and there is no certainty that a deal will be reached, the people said this week.The sources asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential. A spokesman for Thomas H. Lee  declined to comment, while eBay did not respond to a request for comment. eBay's enterprise business, formerly known as GSI Commerce, helps retailers around the world beef up their online presence and e-commerce capabilities. eBay said in January that it would explore strategic alternatives for the unit, which does not fit neatly with its PayPal and marketplace divisions. GSI Commerce was acquired by eBay for $2.4 billion in 2011. It has lost customers and seen sluggish growth in the past few years as its clients move their online operations in-house.Toys ""R"" Us Inc, a client of GSI Commerce since 2006, announced on Thursday it was launching its own online platform, a move that could take away more business from the unit. Based in Boston, Thomas H. Lee has raised approximately $21 billion of equity capital and invested in more than 130 portfolio companies with an aggregate value of over $150 billion since it was founded in 1974.Bloomberg News reported last month that Thomas H. Lee was one of the remaining bidders for eBay's enterprise unit.    (Reporting by Liana B.

269,"   By Devika  Krishna Kumar and Kshitiz Goliya  E-commerce company eBay Inc (EBAY.O) said it was selling its enterprise business to a consortium led by private equity firm Permira for $925 million, as it streamlines its operations ahead of the separation from PayPal Holdings Inc (PYPLV.O).Shares of eBay, which also reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit and boosted its share buyback plan by $1 billion, rose as much as 5 percent in early trading. PayPal was up 4.5 percent on a ""when issued"" basis.The deal leaves eBay with its slow-growing marketplace business, which faces stiff competition from rivals such as Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O).Analysts, however, were bullish on eBay's prospects as a standalone company.""Ebay will not grow nearly as fast as PayPal but it is a very profitable business that generates tremendous amount of cash - some of which they will be able to return to shareholders,"" Wedbush Securities analyst Gil Luria told Reuters.EBay's enterprise business, the company's smallest, was formerly known as GSI Commerce. The business, which eBay purchased in 2011 for $2.4 billion, helps retailers strengthen their online presence and e-commerce capabilities.The business has since lost customers and seen sluggish growth in the past few years as retailers increasingly move their online operations in-house. The unit suffered a blow this month when ToysRUs Inc, one of its largest customers, ended a near decade-long contract to launch its own online platform.The Permira-led consortium of buyers includes Sterling Partners, Longview Asset Management, Innotrac Corp and companies owned by Permira funds. LAST BOOST FROM PAYPAL The sale was announced alongside eBay's second-quarter results, where it reported a 7 percent jump in net revenue.Sales were driven by higher demand in the PayPal business it plans to spin off on Friday.PayPal is slated to begin trading separately on the Nasdaq on July 20, creating a new company that some analysts say will be worth $40 billion. Revenue in the company's marketplace business fell 3 percent, hurt by a strong dollar. Excluding the impact of currency, revenue rose 5 percent.Based on proceeds from the enterprise business sale, the company recorded an impairment of goodwill of about $786 million. It said it expected the deal to close later this year.Excluding items, eBay earned 76 cents per share in the quarter. Net revenue rose to $4.38 billion from $4.10 billion.Analysts on average expected the company to earn 72 cents per share on revenue of $4.49 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

EBay's enterprise business, the company's smallest, was formerly known as GSI Commerce. The business, which eBay purchased in 2011 for $2.4 billion, helps retailers strengthen their online presence and e-commerce capabilities.The business has since lost customers and seen sluggish growth in the past few years as retailers increasingly move their online operations in-house.The unit suffered a blow this month when ToysRUs Inc, one of its largest customers, ended a near decade-long contract to launch its own online platform.The Permira-led consortium of buyers includes Sterling Partners, Longview Asset Management, Innotrac Corp and companies owned by Permira funds. LAST BOOST FROM PAYPAL The sale was announced alongside eBay's second-quarter results, where it reported a 7 percent jump in net revenue. Sales were driven by higher demand in the PayPal business it plans to spin off on Friday.PayPal is slated to begin trading separately on the Nasdaq on July 20, creating a new company that some analysts say will be worth $40 billion.Revenue in the company's marketplace business fell 3 percent, hurt by a strong dollar. Excluding the impact of currency, revenue rose 5 percent.Based on proceeds from the enterprise business sale, the company recorded an impairment of goodwill of about $786 million.

294,"   By Sam Forgione | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Nov 16 Billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn swapped his entire equity stake in eBay Inc  for the same number of shares in PayPal Holdings Inc in the third quarter, regulatory filings showed on Monday.The filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission showed that Icahn sold his stake of 46.3 million shares in eBay and reported the same number of shares in PayPal, which completed its spinoff from eBay in mid-July.Icahn, whose PayPal stake as of Sept. 30 amounted to 3.8 percent of the company, had pushed for eBay to spin off PayPal last year and has board representation at PayPal through Icahn Capital managing director Jonathan Christodoro. Icahn eventually backed off from his push for the spinoff in April of last year. But eBay directors and executives shifted their stance on the split in June of last year after a six-month internal study of the payments landscape. Icahn, who is known for taking large stakes in companies and pushing for management change, also showed that he took a 1.36 million share stake in American International Group Inc  during the third quarter, ahead of publicly pressuring the insurer to split into three companies.In a letter to AIG CEO Peter Hancock in late October, Icahn blasted AIG as ""too big to succeed,"" a riff on the popular ""too big to fail"" phrase that emerged from the financial crisis. The size of Icahn's AIG position had not been previously disclosed, and Icahn may have increased the stake by the time he tweeted that he owned a ""large"" position in the company on Oct. 28.Icahn was not immediately available for comment.

296,"  (Adds analysts' comments, background)By Arathy S Nair and Anya George TharakanNov 23 Activist investor Carl Icahn disclosed a stake in Xerox Corp and called the printer and copier maker's shares ""undervalued,"" sending the stock up 7.6 percent in extended trade.The billionaire revealed a 7.13 percent stake in Xerox in a securities filing on Monday, making him the second-largest shareholder of the 109-year-old company.Icahn, who recently took stakes in American International Group and Freeport-McMoran Inc, said he would look at getting representation on Xerox's board, as well as pursuing strategic alternatives. (1.usa.gov/1Xacd5o)""We are aware that Carl Icahn has made an investment in the company,"" Sean Collins, a Xerox spokesman said. ""Xerox welcomes open communications with shareholders and values constructive dialogue."" Ivan Feinseth, a Tigress Financial Partners LLC analyst, offered a cautious view. ""I like Icahn. He has done well but I just don't know what he can do here,"" Feinseth said.On the other hand, Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP analyst James Friedman said there are multiple things that Icahn can push for in the company, including selling the equity stake in its joint venture Fuji Xerox and separating the Documents business and the IT services business.Xerox's IT services business offers business process outsourcing while the document outsourcing business primarily includes sales of printers and copiers. Friedman thinks Icahn can position himself for a board seat in the upcoming May elections.""Getting on the board is the easy part, actually fixing the business is harder,"" Friedman said.Susquehanna Financial has a valuation on Xerox of $13 per share based on a sum of the parts model, with $9 weighted on the documents business, $3 on the services business and the remaining on the Fuji Xerox business. Xerox, whose shares have fallen more than 22 percent this year, is trying to turn itself around, shifting focus to software and services as corporate customers cut printing costs and consumers shift to mobile devices.It reported its first quarterly net loss in five years in October, which prompted it to review its businesses and capital allocation options. The company, however, said it was not considering a sale.Icahn has considerable success with spinoffs including the split of ebay Inc and Paypal Holdings Inc, and Manitowoc Company Inc's separation of its crane manufacturing business from its food service business.More recently, Icahn has been urging a breakup of American International Group.Vanguard Group Inc, with an 8.37 percent stake, is Xerox's top shareholder, according to Thomson Reuters data.

299,"  NEW YORK Dec 17 Electronic payment company PayPal Holdings Inc said on Thursday it will increase its paid maternity and sick leave programs and offer time off for U.S. employees to volunteer and care for ill family members.Beginning Jan. 1, expectant mothers will receive eight weeks of maternity leave at full pay, an increase from 80 percent. They can also take eight weeks of paid bonding leave for a total of 16 weeks. Fathers, same-sex spouses and domestic partners also are eligible for the new bonding benefit.The company also will provide eight weeks of paid family care leave so workers can assist a seriously ill spouse, child or parent, 40 hours of sick time each year and up to five paid days for volunteering.Marcia Morales-Jaffe, PayPal's chief people officer, said the changes are designed to promote healthy living and to give the company's nearly 10,000 U.S. employees more control over their lives. ""These programs include taking time to celebrate a birth or adoption, to care for a seriously ill family member or simply to take a couple of days rest when needed,"" she said in a blog post. California-based PayPal is the latest in a list of companies that have enhanced benefits for employees. Earlier this month, global technology giant eBay Inc increased its maternity pay for new mothers from 10 weeks at 80 percent pay to 24 weeks at full pay. New dads were also offered 12 weeks off at full pay.Video streaming company Netflix Inc, Microsoft Corp , software company Adobe Systems Inc  and Facebook also have revealed enhanced benefit programs. The United States lags behind other developed countries in the amount of leave given to employees. Only 21 percent of U.S. employers offer paid maternity and 17 percent have programs for paternity leave, according to the Society for Human Resource Management.PayPal, which was founded in the late 1990s, went public in 2002 and was later acquired by eBay. The company separated from eBay's marketplace division earlier this year.

A full  list of ratings follows at the end of this release. Ebay issued the senior notes under the indenture dated Oct. 28, 2010. The notes  are callable in five years and rank pari passu with Ebay's existing senior  unsecured debt. Fitch expects Ebay will use net proceeds from the issuance for  general corporate purposes, including share repurchases and acquisitions.  KEY RATING DRIVERS The ratings and Outlook reflect Fitch's expectations for solid operating  performance, despite a challenging operating environment. Fitch expects low  single digit foreign exchange (FX) neutral revenue growth over the intermediate  term, driven by increasing gross merchandise value (GMV) and mid- to high-single  digit growth in international markets. FX translation should remain a  significant headwind over at least the near-term. Fitch anticipates investments  in cataloging unstructured data to improve search results and incentivizing the  return of lapsed users following the 2014 password reset will drive longer-term  demand. Fitch expects profitability will remain solid with operating EBITDA margin  between 38% and 40%. The benefits of restructuring should offset stand-up costs  related to Ebay's separation from Paypal Holding Inc. (Paypal) at the end of  2015. As a consequence, Fitch expects credit protection measures to remain solid  with total leverage (total debt to operating EBITDA), pro forma for the  issuance, in the 2-2.5 times (x) range. Cash location could drive continued  borrowing over the longer-term, although Fitch expects total leverage will  remain below 3x. Fitch expects the continuation of robust annual FCF of more than $2 billion.  Fitch expects Ebay will use FCF for share repurchases and, to a lesser extent,  acquisitions through the intermediate term Fitch expects intensified share  repurchases in line with eBay's commitment to buying back up to $6 billion of  stock through 2017. Fitch expects Ebay will limited share repurchases to offset  dilution beyond the intermediate term, given significant cash balances outside  of the U.S. The ratings and Outlook are supported by: --Fitch's expectations for significantly higher profitability versus retail  industry peers and low capital intensity resulting in strong and consistent FCF; --Solid financial flexibility supported by $8.5 billion of cash of which $1.5  billion is located within the U.S. and more than $2 billion of annual FCF; --eBay's leading e-commerce platform, especially for specialized product  offerings, with strong brand recognition and technology capabilities; --Large active accounts base and focus on serving small- to medium-sized sellers  provides significant customer diversification. Ratings concerns center on: --Fitch's expectations for revenue growth challenges from increased competition,  as well as periodic changes to Google's search engine algorithm; --Fitch's expectations for more aggressive financial policies over the  longer-term, given reduced strategic rationale for strong investment grade  ratings following the separation of Paypal and likely exacerbated by significant  offshore cash and FCF; --Fitch's expectations for ongoing challenges gaining e-commerce platform  traction in faster growing developing markets with rapid mobile adoption. KEY ASSUMPTIONS --Low single digit FX neutral revenue growth through the intermediate term; --Consistent profitability with operating EBITDA margin of 38% to 40%; --Capital spending remains elevated to accelerate growth opportunities,  including investments in structured, catalogued merchandise; --Incremental debt issuance to support share repurchases and acquisitions, given  cash location. RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive rating actions could occur if Fitch expects: --Management commits to curtailing share repurchases and managing debt to  maintain total leverage closer to 2x; or  --Sustained low- to mid-single digit FX neutral organic revenue growth,  supporting eBay's mobile strategy and resulting in higher and more predictable  FCF. Negative rating actions could occur if Fitch expects: --Operational weakness or more aggressive financial policies will result in  total leverage sustained above 3x; or  --Sustained negative FX neutral revenue growth, indicating an uncompetitive  mobile strategy. LIQUIDITY Fitch believes Ebay's liquidity was strong at Dec. 31, 2015 and supported by:  --$8.5 billion of cash and equivalents, of which $1.5 billion was in the U.S.; --$2 billion undrawn RCF expiring November 2020.  Fitch's expectations for more than $2 billion of annual FCF also supports  liquidity. Total debt as of Dec. 31, 2015, pro forma for the issuance, was $7.5 billion and  consisted of: --$1 billion 1.35% notes due July 2017; --$450 million floating rate notes due July 2017; --$400 million floating rate notes due January 2019; --$1.15 billion 2.2% notes due August 2019; --$500 million 3.25% notes due October 2020; --$750 million 2.875% notes due August 2021; --$1 billion 2.6% notes due July 2022; --$750 million 3.45% notes due August 2024; --$750 million of 4% notes due July 2042; --$750 million of senior notes due 2046.  FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has affirmed the following ratings for eBay: --Long-term IDR at 'BBB';  --Senior unsecured revolving credit facility at 'BBB'; --Senior unsecured notes at 'BBB'; --Short-term IDR and commercial paper at 'F2'. Fitch has assigned a 'BBB' rating to the 40-year senior notes. Contact:  Primary Analyst Jason Pompeii Senior Director +1-312-368-3210 Fitch Ratings, Inc. 70 W.

315,"   By Julia Fioretti | BRUSSELS  BRUSSELS Online retailers would be banned from stopping a customer in one EU country buying from a website based in another, under a proposal issued on Wednesday to make it easier for consumers to shop across the bloc.The European Commission said its law would stop ""geoblocking"" where companies limit access to their websites based on user location, often forcing customers to use versions based in their own country, sometimes with higher prices.""In the online world, all too often consumers are blocked from accessing offers in other countries,"" the Commission said in a statement.""Such discrimination has no place in the single market.""The law would affect companies such as Amazon, eBay and Zalando as well as to sales of services provided in a specific location, for example car rental, accommodation and concert tickets.It would not initially apply to copyright-protected items such as e-books, music and games, although those might be included soon, the Commission said. So for the time being a German citizen would still be unable to buy a Spotify subscription in, for example, Estonia, where it is much cheaper. The music industry welcomed the exemption, saying that to include such services in the geoblocking proposal would be ""a serious blow for cultural diversity.""Under Wednesday's proposal, which requires the approval of the European Parliament and national governments to become law, retailers would not be allowed to block access to websites based on a user's location or to re-route customers to a website version based in their own country without their consent.Amazon already makes its websites accessible to customers anywhere in Europe, and says 98 percent of its own stock is available to shoppers from any European country. While e-commerce websites will not be allowed to prevent customers in one EU country buying products in another, they will not be forced to deliver cross-border.Therefore, an Italian buying a TV from a German website would either have to arrange their own delivery or collect it at the trader's premises.The Commission hopes the new rules will increase the proportion of consumers who buy online from another country, currently only 15 percent. ""The European Commission is doing the right thing by helping solve practical problems faced by online businesses, particularly small and medium sized businesses,"" said eBay's' Paul Todd, Senior Vice President of EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa).A business group said the proposal failed to address the reasons companies use geoblocking, such as differing VAT rates and consumer protection rules.""This is like putting a sticking plaster on a broken leg,"" said John Higgins, director general of DIGITALEUROPE, which represents companies such as Sony, Google and Dropbox.In a separate proposal, the EU executive sought to increase the transparency of prices for cross-border parcel delivery and to give national authorities the power to assess whether they are affordable.

316,"  * EU wants more consumers to buy online from other countries* EU to ban online discrimination based on country of residence* Exemption for copyright-protected services such as music* Separate proposal seeks to make postage prices more affordableBy Julia FiorettiBRUSSELS, May 25 The European Commission proposed on Wednesday to ban Internet retailers from treating customers differently depending on where they live to encourage consumers to shop across the bloc for online products.The legislative proposal will apply to e-commerce websites such as Amazon, eBay and Zalando as well as to sales of services provided in a specific location, for example car rental, accommodation and concert tickets. Geoblocking, limiting services to a country or region, is anathema to the EU executive, which last year presented a wide-ranging plan to knock down national barriers in the online world to create a digital single market.""When a consumer enters a shop in another EU country, the owner does not ask for the consumer's ID in order to accept a purchase or to adjust the price or conditions,"" the Commission said in a statement.""But in the online world, all too often consumers are blocked from accessing offers in other countries... Such discrimination has no place in the single market.""Under the proposal, e-commerce websites will not be allowed automatically to re-route customers to their home version without their consent or block their access entirely. Amazon already makes it retail websites accessible to customers anywhere in Europe, and says 98 percent of its own stock is available to shoppers from any European country.E-commerce websites will also not be allowed to prevent customers in another member state from buying products there, although they will not be forced to deliver cross-border.Therefore, an Italian buying a TV off a German website will either have to arrange their own delivery or collect it at the trader's premises. Only 15 percent of consumers buy online from another country, the Commission said, either because it is too complicated or expensive.However the Commission for the time being exempted copyright-protected online services such as e-books, music and games from the geoblocking ban, saying that could change in the future depending on a review.It thus avoided a showdown with the industry which had argued that it could have a waterbed effect on prices if a German citizen could suddenly buy a Spotify subscription in, say, Estonia, where it is much cheaper.In a separate proposal, the EU executive sought to increase the transparency prices for cross-border parcel delivery and to give national authorities the power to assess whether they are affordable.In addition, national postal operators will have to give other operators access to cross-border parcel delivery services.The proposals will become law once they are approved by the European Parliament and national governments.

321,"   By Heather Somerville  PayPal Holdings Inc (PYPL.O) moved to extend the reach of its online payments business through a deal with Visa Inc (V.N) that is expected to boost the revenue and number of users of the money-transfer service.The partnership announced on Thursday is intended to make it easier for customers to use Visa credit and debit cards in PayPal transactions and allow shoppers to use PayPal in brick-and-mortar retail locations. It is PayPal's latest effort to bring its internet payments service to the physical checkout line.In the year since its spinoff from e-commerce company eBay Inc (EBAY.O), becoming an independently traded company on Wall Street for the second time, PayPal has grown aggressively. Its revenue for the second quarter is up more than 15 percent to $2.65 billion from a year ago and the volume of payments it processes is up 28 percent to $86.21 billion, the company said in its quarterly earnings report.The Visa partnership positions PayPal to sign more deals with major financial institutions. On a call with investors on Thursday, PayPal President and Chief Executive Dan Schulman said: ""We are in discussions with a variety of players in our ecosystem.""The partnership with Visa allows PayPal users to withdraw cash from their PayPal accounts instantly by using a Visa debit card. The process used to take several hours or days, said Bill Ready, PayPal's global head of product and engineering.In exchange, Visa will integrate PayPal into its tap-and-pay feature - which allows the shopper to wave a card or mobile phone over a reader to pay - at certain retail locations. PayPal agreed to share data about those transactions. The company declined to offer specifics on the timeline or locations, and some investors questioned the difficulty of getting agreement from merchants. The deal removes some cost uncertainty for PayPal, as it locks in a set fee PayPal will pay to Visa. Any fee hikes by Visa would be a threat to the company's profitability.""The partnership with Visa has removed an overhang on our business,"" said company Chief Financial Officer John Rainey. But, he added, it also comes with some additional costs from more Visa transactions, at least initially.Still, many investors cheered the partnership as driving ""meaningful upside"" for PayPal, analyst Bill Carcache of Nomura Securities said in a research note.""A collaboration between PayPal and Visa could present a formidable obstacle to Apple Pay (and) Google Wallet,"" added Charles King, principal analyst at Pund-IT. Shares of San Jose, California-based PayPal shares fell about 2 percent in after-hours trading following the call with investors. At their closing price on the Nasdaq of $40.13, shares are up more than 28 percent over the last six months.Visa shares rose less than 1 percent after the closing bell.Eighteen-year-old PayPal has 188 million active customer accounts, an 11 percent increase over a year ago and a 2 percent rise over the first quarter this year, the company said. About 28 percent, or $24 billion, of its payments are now processed on mobile phones.
