0,"   By Dan Levine | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO A gay man was improperly excluded from jury service because of his sexual orientation, a federal appeals court has ruled, illustrating the widening influence of a key U.S. Supreme Court decision on gay rights.The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco on Tuesday ordered a new trial for GlaxoSmithKline Plc against an Abbott Laboratories spinoff because Abbott excluded the potential juror.The case involved Abbott's pricing of HIV medications, a controversial issue in the gay community. Glaxo accused Abbott of improperly hiking the price of one drug, Norvir, to help it preserve sales growth of one of its other HIV blockbusters, Kaletra.The jury returned a mixed verdict in 2011, and Glaxo was awarded far less money than it had originally sought. However, Glaxo appealed the lower court's decision to allow Abbott to exclude the juror, and the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the constitution prohibits jury strikes because of sexual orientation.""Strikes exercised on the basis of sexual orientation continue this deplorable tradition of treating gays and lesbians as undeserving of participation in our nation's most cherished rites and rituals,"" 9th Circuit Judge Stephen Reinhardt wrote for a unanimous three-judge panel.Glaxo spokeswoman Mary Anne Rhyne said the company is pleased with the ruling. Abbott spokesman Scott Stoffel said Abbott passed its HIV portfolio to a new company, AbbVie Inc, last year. AbbVie representative Adelle Infante said the company is evaluating its options. The 9th Circuit on Tuesday cited United States v. Windsor, the U.S. Supreme Court decision last year that struck down part of the federal Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). In that case, Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote that the law defining marriage as between one man and one woman violated the U.S. Constitution's guarantee of equal protection.However, Kennedy's ruling was ambiguous on just how far gay rights protections should extend, Northwestern University law professor Andrew Koppelman said. Since the ruling was issued, judges around the country have grappled with how to apply it in a variety of gay rights cases, including rulings that permitted same-sex marriage in Oklahoma and Utah. Those cases are currently under appeal.""The big difference between now and Windsor is a shift in the culture,"" Koppelman said. ""Discrimination that made intuitive sense to people before doesn't make a whole lot of sense anymore."" Norvir plays a key role in AIDS-fighting cocktails because it can boost the effectiveness of other drugs. Glaxo accused Abbott of raising Norvir's price by 400 percent in 2003, as part of an effort to harm competitors whose drugs were dependent on being used in combination with Norvir.During jury selection in an Oakland, California federal court, a potential juror discussed his partner by using the masculine pronoun ""he"" several times. The juror also said he did not know whether any of his friends were taking the medications at issue in the case.Abbott's attorney sought to exclude the juror, and Glaxo objected, saying that Abbott was attempting to use a peremptory challenge in a discriminatory way. However, U.S. District Judge Claudia Wilken allowed Abbott to exclude the juror. Glaxo had sought $571 million, but after a four-week trial the jury awarded Glaxo $3.5 million.Given the legal reasoning in Windsor, the 9th Circuit held that gays and lesbians deserve the same constitutional protections during jury selection as those enjoyed by African-Americans and women.Juror strikes based on sexual orientation ""deprive individuals of the opportunity to participate in perfecting democracy and guarding our ideals of justice on account of a characteristic that has nothing to do with their fitness to serve,"" Reinhardt wrote.The case in the 9th Circuit is Smithkline Beecham Corp dba GlaxoSmithKline vs. Abbott Laboratories, 11-17357.(Editing by Matthew Lewis)",2014-01-21,ABT,"Tue Jan 21, 2014 | 5:46pm EST",Gay juror's ouster forces new U.S. pharma trial,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-gsk-abbott-ruling-idUSBREA0K1B320140121?type=companyNews

3,"  * Sector dogged by patent rows, price cuts, quality issues* Market leader Abbott, others still investing in India* GlaxoSmithKline spends $1 bln to raise India unit stake* Huge long-term demand seen underpinning double-digit growthBy Ben Hirschler and Zeba SiddiquiMUMBAI, March 12 Global drugmakers have had a nauseous time in India's $14 billion market. Prices have dropped and valuable patents have been overruled as the authorities strive to make medicines affordable for the 70 percent of people living on less than $2 a day.From a regulatory perspective, the government has ""messed up"", as one top industry consultant put it. But with 1.2 billion people increasingly seeking both on- and off-prescription drugs, the market is too big for firms to simply throw in the towel.The two top foreign players, Abbott Laboratories and GlaxoSmithKline Plc, are actually stepping up investment, and others such as AstraZeneca Plc are considering doing so.GSK has just spent $1 billion on raising its stake in locally listed GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals Ltd and plans to double Indian drug production by building a second factory for about $140 million.""There is a real excitement about India in GSK, in both consumer products and pharmaceuticals,"" said Roger Connor, GSK's global head of manufacturing on a visit to Mumbai.India harbours an army of companies driving prices down with copies of off-patent drugs. It also has a government imposing wide-ranging price reductions and a legal system with a history of disallowing patent protection. Perturbed, global drugmakers are soldiering on.Abbott, local No. 1 since buying Piramal Healthcare for $3.7 billion in 2010, has launched 40 drugs in India in the last two years and will open a new factory for nutritional products later this year, said head of Indian operations Bhasker Iyer.Other drugmakers may raise stakes in local units made cheaper by a rupee that has fallen 12 percent in value over the past year compared with the U.S. dollar, said Aditya Khemka of brokerage Ambit Capital. AstraZeneca has said it hopes to take full control of AstraZeneca Pharma India Ltd, at a cost of more than $100 million, to give it greater flexibility in India.Khemka believes Sanofi SA, which has said emerging markets are important for growth, could well be the next to raise its stake in Sanofi India Ltd. A Sanofi spokesman declined to comment.Even Novartis AG, whose cancer drug Glivec was refused a patent by the Supreme Court last April, is launching new drugs.COMPULSORY LICENCE India stunned the pharmaceutical industry in 2012 by overriding a valid patent on cancer drug Nexavar from Bayer AG  and issuing a so-called compulsory licence to Natco Pharma Ltd, allowing the local firm to sell a copy for a fraction of the price. The threat of more such licences has since been hanging over the sector like a Sword of Damocles, said Ranjit Shahani, head of Novartis' India unit.Yet the long-term prospects of the Indian market have not deterred Shahani from launching new patented drugs.""Based on activities on the ground, multinational companies are actually taking larger bets on India,"" said Sujay Shetty, pharmaceuticals leader for PricewaterhouseCoopers in India.""Of course, there is dissatisfaction - but if you really analyse the problems, many of them are working their way out of the system. From a regulatory shock point of view, pretty much everything the government could do to mess up, it has messed up. So this is the worst you're going to see.""The probable handover of government following an upcoming election to the pro-business Bharatiya Janata Party means the threat of compulsory licences may be receding, Shetty said. PRICE CUTTING Market growth fell below 10 percent last year, largely due to government-imposed price cuts on many basic drugs, while even high-end biotech specialist Roche Holding AG agreed to voluntary price cuts for some cancer drugs to improve market access.Pricing pressure was a factor in researcher IMS Health projecting India will be the world's 11th biggest pharmaceutical market by 2017, from 13th in 2012, rather than eighth by 2016 as forecast less than two years ago.Nevertheless, growth should return to double digits in 2014 and stay there for years to come, said Hasit Joshipura, the head of GSK's local subsidiary.GSK is working within the low-price environment by chasing volume. In some cases, the company charges just 10 percent of international prices.""On a volume basis, 20 percent of what I make globally is sold in India, so it is a massive business,"" said GSK's Connor. Yet that makes up only around 3 percent of revenue.The strategy's success depends on an efficient supply chain, in a country where local companies such as Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd have been banned from exporting drugs or drug ingredients to the United States because of quality concerns.""You can be absolutely successful in India from a quality and safety perspective,"" said Connor.GSK not only makes medicines in the country but also buys ingredients from local suppliers which are audited by GSK staff.The U.S. regulator last month called on its Indian counterpart for more collaboration on drug safety. In the meantime, Indian officials have tightened rules surrounding clinical trials to the extent that local firms Biocon Ltd  and Lupin Ltd have moved studies offshore.Uncertainty over patent security and obstacles to clinical trials are discouraging Western companies from conducting drug research in India, though that was not enough to deter Novartis from recently launching patented drugs such as Tasigna and Jakavi for cancer and Galvus for diabetes.""While we certainly would be cautious in our investments in innovation, we do consider India to be an important market,"" said Novartis' Shahani. ""You have to bet on demographics.""",2014-03-12,ABT,"Wed Mar 12, 2014 | 7:49am EDT","Big Pharma still betting on ""messed up"" Indian drugs market",http://www.reuters.com//article/india-bigpharma-idUSL6N0M60JO20140312?type=companyNews
4,"   By Soyoung Kim and Olivia Oran | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Abbott Laboratories (ABT.N) is considering selling a big chunk of its mature drugs, joining a list of large drugmakers seeking to sell their older products in an effort to focus on high-growth areas, people familiar with the matter said.Abbott's portfolio of mature drugs being reviewed for sale has around $2 billion in annual revenue and could fetch more than $5 billion, the people said.The U.S. drugmaker is working with Morgan Stanley (MS.N) to find a buyer for the off-patent, or established products, the people added, asking not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Representatives for Abbott and Morgan Stanley declined to comment.Abbott has a big lineup of established pharmaceuticals, whose sales fell 3 percent last year to $4.97 billion. Analysts have been grumbling for the past year about the performance of the business, which has dragged down overall company results. But Abbott Chief Executive Miles White previously expressed faith in the business, and appreciation for the cash flow it provides that can be used to fund research and other company operations.Abbott's divestiture plans for part of its established products come at a time when its larger competitors are also looking to sell their own line-up of legacy drugs.U.S. drugmaker Merck & Co (MRK.N) is considering selling a big portfolio of mature drugs that could fetch more than $15 billion, Reuters reported on Wednesday. French pharmaceutical company Sanofi SA (SASY.PA) has also been talking to buyers about selling $7 billion to $8 billion worth of mature products in the past few months, people familiar with the matter told Reuters earlier this week.Those drug portfolios would provide good acquisition opportunities for generic drugmakers and specialty pharmaceutical companies, including Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc (VRX.TO), Actavis Plc ACT.N and Mylan Inc (MYL.O), people familiar with the matter and analysts said. Faced with healthcare spending cuts and generic competition, the pharmaceutical industry is undergoing a major restructuring, with companies playing to their strengths by building up certain businesses and divesting others.Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), which spun off its animal health and infant formula businesses in recent years, is also considering whether to divest the hundreds of off-patent drugs that are mostly sold in emerging markets. But Pfizer has said it would be unable to do so until 2017, after the company has better examined the unit's financial performance.Merck's plan to sell its established products is ""highly consistent"" with the company's refocusing strategy and could allow for more meaningful earnings growth, JPMorgan analyst Chris Schott said in a research note on Thursday.(Additional reporting by Ransdell Pierson in New York; editing by Matthew Lewis)",2014-05-02,ABT,"Fri May 2, 2014 | 4:36pm EDT",Exclusive: Abbott taps Morgan Stanley to sell mature products - sources,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-abbott-sale-exclusive-idUSBREA410VJ20140502?type=companyNews

Fitch has affirmed the company's ratings, including the long-term Issuer Default  Rating (IDR), at 'A+'.  A full list of ABT's ratings follows at the end of this  release, and the ratings apply to approximately $7.8 billion of debt outstanding  as of March 31, 2014. KEY RATING DRIVERS While Fitch believes the acquisition of CFRP makes strategic sense, it limits  the company's willingness and ability to reduce leverage (total debt/EBITDA) to  below 1.5x. The rating action also incorporates the following: --That ABT will, in part, focus on shareholders when deploying cash, balancing  the return opportunities of share repurchases, acquisitions and dividends  (regular dividend recently increased by 57%); --That Abbott generates strong free cash flow (FCF) of $1.3 billion-$1.4  billion, which incorporates the recent dividend increase; --That ABT's diversified product portfolio continues to produce mid-single-digit  organic growth with incrementally improving margins in the intermediate term;  --That sales of Nutritionals, Diagnostics, and Established Pharmaceuticals, in  particular, should benefit from the rapidly growing middle class in emerging  markets; and --Fitch expects a continued weak employment environment in the U.S. and  government austerity measures in Europe to weigh on Abbott's growth and margins  in the developed markets;  --Fitch anticipates that ABT's efforts to improve gross and operating margins  will continue to yield results, more than offsetting the aforementioned  headwinds . Acquisition May Limit Deleveraging Fitch believes that the CFRP acquisition may limit ABT's ability and willingness  to reduce total debt leverage to below 1.5x. While Fitch forecasts the  acquisition to increase Abbott's pro forma total debt leverage only modestly,  the company is currently operating with leverage of 1.76x, higher than the  1.3x-1.5x range expected for this issuer's 'A+' credit rating. With available  cash and short-term investments of approximately $7 billion at March 31, 2014  and forecasted 2014 FCF of $1.3 billion-$1.4 billion, the company may choose to  build cash balances rather than pay down short-term debt. In Fitch's view, the acquisition of CFR Pharmaceuticals makes strategic sense,  as it would increase Abbott's already strong position in the fast-growing Latin  American branded-generic pharmaceutical market. ABT expects CFRP will contribute  $900 million to annual sales in 2015. Developing markets such as Latin America  are expected to provide the bulk for growth of this product segment. The  acquisition does pose some integration risk, but Abbott has stated that the  financial success of this acquisition does not rely on anticipated significant  cost synergies. In addition, the company has successfully integrated  significantly larger acquisitions in the past. The transaction is expected to  close by the end of the third quarter of 2014. Shareholder-Focused Cash Deployment Fitch believes ABT will be opportunistic with cash deployment as it weighs  potential returns for shareholders. As such, the company will likely remain  acquisitive, focusing on companies or device platforms that offer innovation and  growth, as technological advancement in the device sector remains relatively  fragmented.  ABT may also consider targets that offer further expansion opportunities into  favorable geographies, as evidenced by the announced CFRP acquisition. Fitch  expects share repurchases will likely continue, especially in the absence of  viable acquisition targets. The company has demonstrated commitment to its  dividend, as evidenced by the recently announced 57% dividend increase beginning  February 2014.  Solid FCF Fitch estimates that ABT will generate solid FCF of $1.3 billion-$1.4 billion in  2014, below the 2013 level due to the $500 million increase in the company's  dividend. Nevertheless, positive FCF is expected to be supported by dependable  revenue growth and incrementally improving margins. FCF should be sufficient to  fund moderate share repurchases and targeted acquisitions.  Stable Operations Expected Fitch forecasts that ABT's diversified product portfolio will continue to  produce mid-single-digit organic growth in the intermediate term, given the  strength of its product offerings and its geographic mix. Emerging markets will  represent a larger portion of ABT's revenue. Increasing revenues and margin  support should provide for solid FCF generation. Emerging Markets Support Growth Fitch expects the majority of ABT's growth will come from emerging markets  during the next two years. Abbott expects that in the coming years, a greater  portion of its revenues will be generated in faster growing geographic markets,  including the developing markets versus the developed markets of the U.S.,  Western Europe and Japan.  Nutrition and Established Pharmaceuticals should benefit from the rapidly  growing middle class in these markets.  The vast majority of purchases in these  markets are paid for by consumers.  The Diagnostics and Medical Devices business  should benefit from the growing importance of accessible healthcare as  healthcare expenditures become a greater part of these countries' economies.  This is in contrast to the developed markets, where the vast majority of  purchases involve third-party payers. As such, rising disposable income is an  important driver of demand in these markets. Developed Markets to Remain Soft Fitch expects demand trends in developed markets (U.S., Europe and Japan) to  remain relatively soft during the next 12 months. A weak employment environment  in the U.S. and government austerity measures in Europe will likely persist in  the near term. These trends will affect ABT's Established Pharmaceuticals and  Medical Devices segments the most.  Efforts to Support Margins Fitch anticipates that ABT will continue efforts to drive efficiencies across  business segments, resulting in improving margins. Most recently, the company is  focused on improving the cost structure in its Nutrition, Established  Pharmaceutical and Diagnostic segments. In addition, it has taken out some  general and administrative corporate costs.  Adequate Liquidity  Fitch expects ABT to maintain adequate liquidity, as the company had  approximately $7 billion in cash and short-term investments at March 31, 2014  and its unused $5 billion revolving credit facility that expires in July 18,  2017. However, the company had roughly $4.4 billion in short-term debt. In  addition, the company will likely continue to have ample access to public debt  markets. Manageable Debt Maturities  At March 31, 2014, ABT had approximately $7.8 billion in debt outstanding,  including $4.4 billion in short-term debt. Fitch believes the company's debt  maturities are manageable with roughly $947 million maturing in 2019 and $597  million in 2020. Fitch's forecasts assume that ABT will refinance most of these  maturities with the proceeds from new debt issuances. RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive While Fitch does not anticipate a positive rating action in the near- to  intermediate-term, revision of the Outlook to Stable could result from ABT  committing to and operating with leverage stronger than 1.5x, which would likely  require some paydown of short-term debt in the next 12-18 months. In addition,  Fitch would expect the company to achieve and maintain relatively stable  operations and solid FCF. Negative Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a one-notch  downgrade to 'A/F1' include debt remaining above 1.5x EBITDA without the  prospect for timely deleveraging (i.e. within the next 12-18 months), which  could be the result of operational stress and weakening FCF and capital  deployment that does not consider possible debt reduction, if needed.  Fitch has revised ABT's Rating Outlook to Negative and affirmed its ratings as  follows: --Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A+';  --Senior unsecured bank loan at 'A+'; --Senior unsecured debt at 'A+'; --Short-term IDR at 'F1'; --Commercial paper at 'F1'.

12,"   By Megan Davies | MOSCOW  MOSCOW U.S. healthcare firm Abbott Laboratories (ABT.N) is to buy Russian drugmaker Veropharm VRPH.MM for up to $495 million, giving it a manufacturing presence in a country where it has been operating for nearly 40 years, Abbott said on Tuesday.The deal bucks a drought in Russian M&A activity this year due to the country's faltering economy and the Ukraine crisis. U.S. companies have been particularly stymied from investing here with Washington advising top executives to steer clear of a major Russian investment forum in May. Abbott's purchase is the largest acquisition by a U.S. company in Russia since Philip Morris International Inc (PM.N) and Japan Tobacco Inc (2914.T) in December announced plans to buy stakes in cigarette distributor Megapolis for $750 million each, according to Thomson Reuters data. Shares in Veropharm, one of Russia's biggest drugmakers with a market capitalization of $300 million, shot up 34 percent to a three-year high by early afternoon trading in Moscow.""Russia's middle class is growing and when the middle class grows the sector that grows is healthcare,"" said one trader. ""There is an aging population and it is a country that really needs good pharma. If you want to get a part of that market you've got to be a local producer and this is a way for Abbott to be locally producing.""  It is the latest foray by Abbott into emerging markets, following a $2.9 billion deal earlier in the year to buy Chile's CFR Pharmaceuticals SA CFR.SN. Abbott, which sells healthcare devices and branded generics in 150 countries, last year split into two businesses and spun off its blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drug in a new company, AbbVie Inc (ABBV.N). It has said it plans to focus the branded generics business on about 14 or 15 fast-growing emerging markets.Under the deal, Abbott will buy Garden Hills, a holding company which owns a controlling interest in Veropharm, for a range of $395 million to $495 million, depending on Garden Hills' ownership of Veropharm at the time of closure, Abbott said.  Garden Hills currently owns more than 80 percent of Veropharm but is expected to own more than 95 percent when the deal closes, Abbott said. Abbott will assume net debt of $136 million and plans to fund the transaction with cash on the balance sheet, it said. It expects the deal, to close in the fourth quarter, to add $150 million in sales in 2015. The Illinois-based company, which has been operating in Russia since 1978, said the deal would allow it to establish a manufacturing presence in the country. Veropharm has three pharmaceutical manufacturing sites in Pokrov, Belgorod and Voronezh. Abbott employs 1,400 staff in Russia in research and development, logistics, sales and marketing, according to its website.

14,"  WELLINGTON, July 11 New Zealand dairy co-operative Fonterra and U.S. healthcare company Abbott are planning to build up to five dairy farms in China to secure domestic supply to meet rising demand for milk in the world's second-largest economy.In a statement issued on Friday, the world's largest dairy exporter and Abbott, a major infant formula seller in China, said they had signed a $300 million agreement to build up the  farms in one of the world's fastest growing dairy markets, which would produce up to 160 million litres of milk each year.The planned hub, whose location is yet to be decided, would be Fonterra's third, following similar dairying centres in China's Shanxi and Hebei provinces. If the plan is approved by Chinese authorities, the companies said the first farm would begin producing in early 2017.""Farming hubs are a key part of our strategy to be a more integrated dairy business in Greater China, contribute to the growth and development of the local Chinese dairy industry and help meet local consumers' needs for safe, nutritious dairy products,"" Fonterra Chief Executive Officer Theo Spierings said in a statement. The deal would build on the existing relationship between the two companies, as Fonterra counts Abbott as a wholesale client of its milk powder products, which include Similac infant formula brand.Abbott is expanding its production capabilities in China, opening an infant formula plant near Shanghai in June. ""This strategic partnership gives us flexibility for the future on however we use milk,"" an Abbott spokesman said.Abbott recalled some of its milk formula brands in China and Vietnam in August after a contamination scare involving  products containing Fonterra-produced ingredients, which proved to be false. Abbott in April said the recall crimped sales of milk formula products by $75 million in the first quarter.Global milk formula makers are pushing to capitalise on increasing dairy demand from China, where growing middle classes are developing a voracious appetite for cheese, milk formula and other products.(Reporting by Naomi Tajitsu; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)",2014-07-10,ABT,"Thu Jul 10, 2014 | 6:30pm EDT","Fonterra, Abbott to build dairy farms in China",http://www.reuters.com//article/abbott-fonterra-china-idUSL4N0PL5JI20140710?type=companyNews
15,"   By Soyoung Kim | NEW YORK  NEW YORK U.S. generic drugmaker Mylan Inc is in advanced talks to acquire a multibillion-dollar portfolio of established products from Abbott Laboratories, people familiar with the matter said.The proposed transaction, which is in late-stage discussions, would see Mylan acquire a big chunk of Abbott's Europe-based mature drugs for several billion dollars, said the people, who asked not to be named because the matter is not public.The acquisition of the foreign assets, according to some of the people, could also allow the U.S. company to change its tax address to overseas, a practice known as inversion that has become popular among healthcare companies seeking to cut their tax bills and gain access to cash held offshore.The exact value of Mylan's bid could not be learned, but people familiar with the matter previously told Reuters that Abbott was looking to sell a portfolio of mature drugs that could fetch more than $5 billion.    A deal could come as soon as next week, but the discussions are continuing and could still fall apart, the people cautioned.Abbott’s established pharmaceuticals division is headquartered in Basel, Switzerland and had 2013 sales of roughly $5 billion. About half of the sales come from emerging markets, and the remainder from other international markets.    Representatives for Mylan declined to comment, while Abbott did not respond to requests for comment. A potential deal with Abbott would come after Mylan's failed attempt to buy Swedish drugmaker Meda AB earlier this year. Meda in April rejected Mylan's revised $6.7 billion takeover bid, saying its biggest shareholder did not back a deal.Mylan was looking to do an inversion deal partly because it was at a disadvantage compared with foreign rivals as well as other U.S. generic drugmakers that have redomiciled to a low-tax country.Major competitors include Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd, which is based in Israel, and Actavis Plc, which re-domiciled to Ireland through a 2013 acquisition of Warner Chilcott. Both face lower tax rates. Tax inversions allow U.S. companies, which face one of the highest tax rates in the world - a federal tax rate of 35 percent, and an overall rate that can be close to 40 percent, including state and local taxes - to move to a lower-tax country by buying or creating a new holding company.The deal would add to a flurry of dealmaking in the healthcare sector, which more than tripled to $317.4 billion in the first half of 2014 from the same period last year. Reuters first reported in May that Abbott has tapped Morgan Stanley to find a buyer for the off-patent drugs so that it can free up resources to invest in high-growth areas.Other large pharmaceutical companies including GlaxoSmithKline Plc, Sanofi SA and Merck & Co Inc are also looking to shed older drugs, many of which have lost patent protection and face shrinking sales.Faced with healthcare spending cuts and generic competition, the pharmaceutical industry is undergoing a major restructuring, with companies playing to their strengths by building up certain businesses and divesting others.

""We see Mylan creating a platform for potential future acquisitions with this deal,"" thanks to revenue from the Abbott products and a lowered tax rate of 20 to 21 percent in the first full year and high-teens later on, said JP Morgan analyst Chris Schott.Mylan shares were up 2.7 percent at $51.55 on the Nasdaq in early afternoon, while Abbott shares were up almost 1 percent at $41.66 on the New York Stock Exchange. Abbott will transfer assets - now sold in Europe, Japan, Canada, Australia and New Zealand - to a new publicly traded company in the Netherlands that will also include Mylan's existing businesses.Abbott will receive 105 million shares of the combined company, giving it an ownership stake of about 21 percent that is worth $5.3 billion based on Mylan's closing stock price on Friday.  Abbott will continue to sell its branded generics, however, in emerging markets, where strong sales growth is expected because of rising numbers of middle-class patients. By contrast, its sales of generics in developed markets have been steadily declining in recent years due to price pressures in Europe.Although the deal would hurt Abbott's 2015 earnings, the suburban Chicago company said it plans relatively quickly to sell its stake in the new company and use the proceeds to boost Abbott's earnings, such as by acquiring more medical devices or buying back its shares.""While we have a very positive view toward Mylan stock, we do not expect to be a long-term shareholder in Mylan,"" Abbott Chief Executive Miles White told investors in a conference call on Monday. Reuters had reported on Friday that Mylan was in advanced talks to buy a multibillion-dollar portfolio of established products from Abbott.

20,"  * Move aimed towards making drugs more affordable in India* New price caps effective July 11 - govt official* Sanofi India MD says ""shocked and disappointed"" by price cap decision* Sanofi India closes down 10 pct in Mumbai   (Adds comments from analysts, drugmakers, share price, context)By Zeba SiddiquiMUMBAI, July 14 India has capped the prices of more than 100 drugs used to treat diseases ranging from diabetes to HIV, a move likely to hit the profit margins of drug firms such as Sanofi SA, Abbott Laboratories and Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd.The drug pricing regulator's decision, aimed at improving affordability, was slammed by the drugmakers in India, where  prices of generic drugs sold are already low compared with international markets.India, an emerging market for drugmakers, last year raised the number of drugs that are subject to price control to cover up to 30 percent of the total medicines sold in the country, according to industry officials.""While we appreciate the government's intent to improve affordability ... the manner and method in which this unilateral decision has been taken, is untenable,"" Sanofi India's  Managing Director Shailesh Ayyangar said on Monday. ""We are evaluating the impact of this order on our ability to continue offering our products with the same value proposition,"" he said, adding the decision has ""shocked and disappointed"" the pharmaceutical industry.The notice by the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA), published on its website on Friday, coincides with moves by the health ministry to widen the list of essential medicines that will be subject to a price cap, people familiar with the matter said last month.The move is aimed at making medicines more affordable in a country where 70 percent of the population lives on less than $2 a day. More than four-fifths of India's 1.2 billion also have no health insurance.The new price caps took effect on July 11, an NPPA official said. Injeti Srinivas, who took charge as NPPA's chairman in June, was not immediately available for comment.""This is very unexpected and unfortunate. One would expect them to proceed with revising the list of essential medicines, but this has caught people by surprise,"" said Sujay Shetty, PwC's India leader of pharmaceuticals and life sciences. ""They should have done a little more thinking and consultations. This way, they're going to drive out the better players from the market, and the quality of drugs could be compromised.""Shares in Sanofi India closed down 10 percent at 2,923.05 rupees on Monday and Ranbaxy fell 0.4 percent to 553.70 rupees, while the main Mumbai market index ended little changed from its previous close.PUBLIC INTEREST  Analysts at Nomura on Sunday named Sanofi India, the Indian unit of French drugmaker Sanofi, Abbott Healthcare Private Ltd, a unit of U.S.-based Abbott Laboratories, and local firm Ranbaxy as among companies that will be most impacted by the price cap.Abbott and Ranbaxy did not respond to requests for comment.""Though the impact is limited, the move by the NPPA has increased the risk of additional controls in the future,"" Nomura analysts Saion Mukherjee and Lalit Kumar wrote in the report.The drug pricing regulator invoked a rarely-used provision that gives the agency the right to fix the prices of any drug ""in extraordinary circumstances, if it considers necessary so to do in public interest"".A spokesman for Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Ltd, India's second-largest drugmaker by sales, said the company was assessing its next step, but does not expect the price caps to have a material impact on its financial results.""At an industry level, there may be some discussion to see whether one can challenge this,"" he said, but added that the regulator's decision to invoke the ""public interest"" provision would make the options limited.Drugs included in the price cap list are ""fairly meaningful molecules,"" so companies would not exit the market, said Arvind Bothra, an analyst at brokerage Religare Capital.""They will take the price cut, increase their volumes, and move on. The bigger problem for the industry is the uncertainty this ad-hoc expansion brings.""

22,"   By Zeba Siddiqui | MUMBAI, July 14  MUMBAI, July 14 India's pharmaceutical pricing regulator has cut and capped the prices of more than 100 drugs used to treat diseases ranging from diabetes to HIV to malaria, a move likely to hit the profit margins of drug firms like Sanofi SA, Abbott Laboratories and Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd.The notice by the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA), published on its website on Friday, coincides with moves by the health ministry to widen the list of essential medicines which will be subject to a price cap, people familiar with the matter told Reuters last month.India last year raised the number of drugs that are subject to price controls to cover up to 30 percent of the total medication sold in the country, according to industry officials. The new price caps took effect on July 11, an NPPA official said. Injeti Srinivas, who took charge as NPPA's chairman in June, was not immediately available for comment.Controlling the prices of drugs will help provide affordable medicine for the 70 percent of the population who live on less than $2 a day. More than four-fifths of India's 1.2 billion also have no health insurance. Prices of the generic drugs sold in India are already low compared with international markets, a factor that pressures drug companies' revenue.The NPPA said it was using its right to fix the prices of any drug ""in extraordinary circumstances, if it considers necessary so to do in public interest"". In a research note on Sunday, analysts at Nomura named Sanofi India, the Indian unit of French drugmaker Sanofi SA, Abbott Healthcare Private Ltd, a unit of U.S.-based Abbott Laboratories, and local firm Ranbaxy as among companies that will be most impacted by the price cap.The companies did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.""Though the impact is limited, the move by the NPPA has increased the risk of additional controls in the future,"" Nomura analysts Saion Mukherjee and Lalit Kumar wrote in the report.

23,"   By Ransdell Pierson  Abbott Laboratories Inc (ABT.N) reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings on Wednesday as demand for its recently-recalled infant formulas began to recover and profit margins improved for other business segments.Sales of nutritional products, the company's biggest product line which includes Similac infant formula and Ensure beverages for adults, rose 1.6 percent to $1.73 billion, following declines in previous quarters.""The business seems to be stabilizing,"" said Edward Jones analyst Jeff Windau. ""Customers are getting more comfortable now with the quality of Abbott's formulas, so we expect better growth in the second half of the year.""   A recall of pediatric milk formula brands in China and Vietnam last August, due to fears an ingredient provided by an outside supplier might be contaminated, crimped sales of the products by $40 million in the second quarter.    But that was less than the $75 million hit seen in the prior quarter. Abbott said it is quickly recapturing share in the affected markets, having just introduced several new products and by opening a new Similac manufacturing plant in China.""We're recovering as well as we could in that one-year time frame,"" Abbott Chief Executive Miles White told analysts on a conference call. ""We're getting back to the track we want to be on."" Abbott said it earned $466 million, or 30 cents per share, in the quarter. That compared with $476 million, or 30 cents, in the year-earlier period, when Abbott took charges for cost-saving initiatives and other expenses.    Excluding special items, Abbott earned 54 cents per share, topping Wall Street expectations of 51 cents. The company said the outperformance was due to improved profit margins for its diagnostics and vascular products.Global company sales rose 1.9 percent to $5.55 billion, a bit above Wall Street estimates of $5.52 billion. Diagnostics posted the best showing in the quarter, growing 4.8 percent to $1.19 billion, with double digit sales growth in the United States. Sales of medical devices rose 1.2 percent to $1.37 billion.Abbott early last year spun off its branded patent-protected prescription drugs into a new publicly traded company, Abbvie Inc (ABBV.N), but continued to sell generic medicines.Abbott generics have suffered declining sales over the past year and hurt overall company results. But the flat sales in the second quarter, of $1.22 billion, were a welcome contrast to the 6.6 percent slump seen in the prior quarter. In a move cheered by investors, Abbott on Monday said it would sell its generics business in developed markets outside the United States to Mylan Inc MYL.N in a deal valued at $5.3 billion. But Abbott will continue to sell its generic brands in fast-growing emerging markets. The suburban Chicago-based company raised its full-year profit forecast to between $2.19 and $2.29 per share, from  $2.16 to $2.26 per share.Company shares slipped 0.3 percent at $41.04 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange, amid modest declines for the drug sector.

25,"   By Natalie Huet | PARIS  PARIS Sanofi (SASY.PA) has held talks with Abbott Laboratories (ABT.N), Mylan (MYL.O) and private equity firms over the possible sale of a 6.3 billion euro ($8.5 billion) portfolio of mature drugs, according to an internal document seen by Reuters.The 25-page document, a copy of which was circulated by the CGT union on Wednesday, details a plan presented to the company's investment committee on May 6 dubbed the ""Phoenix project"".It shows Sanofi is considering whether to sell, carve out or create a joint venture for a portfolio of some 200 mature drugs that includes blood thinner Plavix, anti-epileptic Depakine and antibiotic Pyostacine.The portfolio currently accounts for annual sales of about 2.1 billion euros but these are projected to drop by two-fifths in the next decade as European countries tighten healthcare budgets and impose lower drug prices.No decision has yet been made on the portfolio, a Sanofi spokesman said.  ""Materials and studies on different topics are regularly presented to the investment committee, and it doesn't always take action or render decisions based on presented materials,"" he said in an emailed statement.    Reuters had reported in April that Sanofi was looking to sell a multi-billion portfolio of mature products, as drugmakers worldwide seek to shed non-core assets and focus on high-growth areas. The Phoenix project aims to minimize exposure to price cuts, reduce Sanofi's manufacturing in Europe and free up cash, according to the document. It would concern six manufacturing and distribution sites and some 2,600 staff in Europe, mainly in France, Spain, Italy and Germany.     The document shows that as of May, Sanofi had begun talks with Abbott, Mylan and private equity firms TPG and Warburg Pincus as potential buyers or venture partners.    It adds that Pfizer (PFE.N), Otsuka (4768.T) and Teva (TEVA.TA) were not interested in the portfolio, while talks with AstraZeneca (AZN.L) and GSK (GSK.L) were still pending.     The CGT union said in a statement it planned to bring the document to the attention of the French government to denounce what it called Sanofi's ""capitalist Monopoly game"" and to protect local jobs.     ""It shows that management's strategy is to withdraw from Europe and particularly from France,"" the union said.    Drug companies are increasingly looking to shed smaller divisions they view as non-core so they can better focus on their mainstay products. They have also shown willingness to consider large asset swaps with rivals to exit weaker businesses and reinforce core areas where they are already top players.

30,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, August 29 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings maintains CFR Pharmaceuticals S.A. and  its subsidiary CFR International SpA on Rating Watch Positive in anticipation of  their acquisition by Abbott Investments Luxembourg S.A.R.L., a subsidiary of  Abbott Laboratories (Abbott; rated 'A+' by Fitch). A complete list of rating  actions follows at the end of this press release. KEY RATING DRIVERS Rating Watch Positive  Fitch initially placed the companies on Positive Watch in May following the  announcement that Abbott's subsidiary had entered into a definitive agreement to  acquire 72.62% of CFR's issued and outstanding shares from its controlling  shareholder and would conduct a public cash tender offer for all of CFR's  outstanding shares. Assuming all publicly-held shares are tendered, the total  purchase price would be approximately USD2.9 billion, plus the assumption of net  debt of approximately USD430 million. Fitch expects the transaction to close in the fourth quarter at which time the  Rating Watch Positive will be resolved. Assuming the transaction is consummated  on the agreed upon terms, the outcome is expected to result in at least a  one-notch upgrade of CFR's long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) and senior  unsecured debt. The upgrade could be significantly more than one notch if CFR's  debt is guaranteed by Abbott and if it successfully integrates CFR both  financially and operationally.  Fitch believes Abbott's acquisition of CFR makes sense strategically, as it  would increase Abbott's already strong position in the fast growing Latin  American branded-generic pharmaceutical market. Developing markets such as Latin  America are expected to provide the bulk of growth for this product segment.  Abbott expects CFR to contribute approximately USD900 million to its annual  sales by 2015. The acquisition does pose some integration risk, yet Abbott has  stated that the financial success of this acquisition does not rely on  anticipated significant cost reductions resulting from potential synergies. Deleveraging Expected to Continue CFR's net leverage has declined to 2.9x at March 31, 2014 since reaching its  peak of 3.6x after acquiring Lafrancol, a Colombian pharmaceutical company, in  2012. A full year's consolidation of Lafrancol pushed net leverage down to 3.1x  in 2013. The company's goal is to reach net leverage at or below 2.5x; Fitch  expects CFR to lower its leverage to 2.5x by the end of 2015 after a full year  of ownership by Abbott. Strong Operational Performance Revenues increased 34% to USD768 million in 2013 mainly as a result of  Lafrancol's consolidation. Revenues were USD782 million as of the last 12 months  (LTM) ended March 31, 2014. CFR's EBITDA was USD153 million in 2013, up almost  60% from 2012. CFR has been able to capture short-term cost savings in Colombia  of approximately USD10 million to USD12 million from improving its distribution  system and reducing its back office. EBITDA was USD150 million as of the March  31 LTM. Fitch expects continued strong performance as Abbott has a larger sales  force and wishes to grow in emerging markets, and CFR will benefit from stronger  negotiation power when purchasing raw materials. Strong Business Position CFR is a market leader in the branded-generics segment. It has a market share of  7% in Chile and 11% in Peru. Through the integration of Lafrancol's business,  CFR was able to position itself as the leading pharmaceutical company in  Colombia with a market share of 9%. In Argentina the company is the leader in  complex injectable products. Abbott's acquisition of CFR should further solidify  CFR's position in the region. Geographic Diversification CFR has operations in Colombia, Chile, Argentina, and Peru, and a commercial  presence in about 20 emerging market countries. Nearly 70% of sales are  generated in investment-grade countries such as Colombia, Chile, and Peru. CFR's  ratings are constrained by the risks of operating in Argentina and Venezuela,  each accounting for 12% of consolidated sales. Fitch maintains the following ratings on Rating Watch Positive: CFR Pharmaceuticals S.A. --Long-term IDR 'BBB-'; --Local currency long-term IDR 'BBB-'; --National long-term rating 'A (cl)'; --National scale issue ratings and debt programs 'A (cl)'. CFR International SpA --Notes due in 2022 'BBB-'. Fitch has affirmed the following rating: CFR Pharmaceuticals S.A. --National Equity Rating 'Primera Clase Nivel 3(cl)' RATING SENSITIVITIES --A positive rating action would likely coincide with the successful completion  of the acquisition, at which time the linkage between CFR and its new parent  will be analyzed under Fitch's parent-subsidiary methodology. If the linkage is  viewed as strong, CFR's ratings could be upgraded significantly. A final  decision will depend on the assessment of legal, operational and strategic ties  between the two companies --A negative rating action would result from the acquisition falling through. In  this case, the Rating Watch Positive would be removed and the ratings affirmed  at their current levels.

31,"   By Bill Berkrot  Abbott's Absorb dissolving heart stent proved as safe and effective one year after being placed in a diseased artery as the company's market-leading Xience drug coated metal stent with a significantly lower rate of chest pain, according to data presented at a medical meeting on Sunday.Absorb works in the same way as traditional heart stents, propping open arteries that have been cleared of blockages to restore normal blood flow. But unlike metal stents that remain permanently in place, Absorb softens over several months and  dissolves in two to three years, allowing the treated artery to regain more normal flexibility to expand and contract.In the 501-patient study called Absorb II - the first randomized head-to-head trial using Absorb - the stent technology was found to be as good as, or non-inferior to, Xience, researchers said.The most notable difference observed after one year in the European study was the rate of angina, a type of chest pain associated with diminished blood flow to the heart. Angina can add to healthcare costs, requiring repeat doctor or hospital visits and the use of more diagnostic testing. It can also hamper patient activity. Over the course of the year, the rate of angina in patients who received Absorb was 16.4 percent versus 25.6 percent for Xience patients, which was viewed as statistically significant.  ""The lower rate of chest pain observed in people treated with Absorb is a promising finding that shows that Absorb may offer people unique quality of life benefits beyond the excellent clinical outcomes already offered with drug eluting stents,"" Dr. Patrick Serruys, the study's lead investigator who presented the data at the Transcatheter Cardiovascular Therapeutics (TCT) meeting in Washington, said in a statement.The combined rate of death for any cause, all heart attacks and the need for repeat procedures was 7.3 percent for Absorb and 9.1 percent for Xience. The target lesion failure rate - a composite of cardiac death, heart attack caused by a reblockage of the vessel and need for another procedure - was 4.8 percent for Absorb and 3.0 percent for Xience.  The rate of definite or probable stent thrombosis - a blood clot forming at the site of the stent - was 0.9 percent for the dissolving device, researchers reported.Absorb is approved in Europe, but Abbott said it believes many doctors were waiting for data from a randomized trial to ensure confidence in the device, which had been previously tested in single arm studies. ""We wanted to put it head-to-head against what is considered best in class technology,"" John Capek, Abbott's head of medical devices said, referring to the company's Xience stent. A similar U.S. trial involving more than 2,200 patients  will be the basis of the company's application seeking approval with the Food and Drug Administration expected to be filed in the second half of 2015, Abbott said.

But unlike metal stents that remain permanently in place, Absorb softens over several months and  dissolves in two to three years, allowing the treated artery to regain more normal flexibility to expand and contract.In the 501-patient study called Absorb II - the first randomized head-to-head trial using Absorb - the stent technology was found to be as good as, or non-inferior to, Xience, researchers said.The most notable difference observed after one year in the European study was the rate of angina, a type of chest pain associated with diminished blood flow to the heart. Angina can add to healthcare costs, requiring repeat doctor or hospital visits and the use of more diagnostic testing. It can also hamper patient activity. Over the course of the year, the rate of angina in patients who received Absorb was 16.4 percent versus 25.6 percent for Xience patients, which was viewed as statistically significant.""The lower rate of chest pain observed in people treated with Absorb is a promising finding that shows that Absorb may offer people unique quality of life benefits beyond the excellent clinical outcomes already offered with drug eluting stents,"" Dr. Patrick Serruys, the study's lead investigator who presented the data at the Transcatheter Cardiovascular Therapeutics (TCT) meeting in Washington, said in a statement. The combined rate of death for any cause, all heart attacks and the need for repeat procedures was 7.3 percent for Absorb and 9.1 percent for Xience. The target lesion failure rate - a composite of cardiac death, heart attack caused by a reblockage of the vessel and need for another procedure - was 4.8 percent for Absorb and 3.0 percent for Xience.The rate of definite or probable stent thrombosis - a blood clot forming at the site of the stent - was 0.9 percent for the dissolving device, researchers reported. Absorb is approved in Europe, but Abbott said it believes many doctors were waiting for data from a randomized trial to ensure confidence in the device, which had been previously tested in single arm studies.""We wanted to put it head-to-head against what is considered best in class technology,"" John Capek, Abbott's head of medical devices said, referring to the company's Xience stent.A similar U.S. trial involving more than 2,200 patients  will be the basis of the company's application seeking approval with the Food and Drug Administration expected to be filed in the second half of 2015, Abbott said.

""That's what happened here, there had to be some tweaks"" in the Abbott/Mylan contract.Windau said many investors had feared the new Treasury rules might derail the deal, and they took comfort in statements by both Abbott and Pittsburgh-based Mylan on Wednesday that the transaction would go through in the first quarter of 2015. ""People assume this has to do with proposed regulatory  actions by Treasury,"" said Josh Jennings, an analyst with Cowen and Co. ""I don't know what their advisors told them to do. I would have appreciated more information.""Concern about the Treasury rule changes prompted AbbVie (ABBV.N), an Abbott spinoff, earlier this week to walk away from its planned $55 billion purchase of Ireland-based drugmaker Shire Plc (SHP.L).Provisions of the Abbott/Mylan deal have been changed, Mylan said in a regulatory filing on Wednesday. One change is that Mylan will get better pricing terms at Abbott facilities that will make and supply products for Mylan. Another change, Mylan said, is that it will issue 110 million shares in the newly formed company to Abbott, 5 million more than the original terms dictated. Abbott plans to transfer generic drugs that it sells in Europe, Japan, Canada, Australia and New Zealand to a new company in the Netherlands that would also include Mylan's existing businesses. Mylan shareholders will now own 78 percent of the company and Abbott will own 22 percent. The original terms called for a 79 percent/21 percent split.Under long-standing Treasury rules, a company that wants to take up tax citizenship in a new country must be less than 80-percent owned by its original U.S. investors. That rule was tightened last month to make it harder for companies to evade the 80-20 rule by slimming down on the U.S. side, or bulking up on the non-U.S. side, through financial maneuvers.Christopher Geier, partner in charge of the investment banking practice at Sikich, a professional services firm in Naperville, Illinois, said the contract changes apparently were made to help ensure that old Mylan shareholders own less than 80 percent of the new company. As for why the companies have not more fully explained the tweaks to their deal, Geier said, “To the extent they can do these things and not violate any sort of disclosure things they will, and you almost can’t blame them for that.”Abbott spokesman Scott Stoffel and Mylan spokeswoman Nina Devlin said they could not comment about the contract changes, beyond the limited details included in their separate regulatory filings and on an Abbott conference call.Abbott earlier on Wednesday said its third-quarter sales, including generics to be sold to Mylan which are now considered discontinued products, rose 4.7 percent to $5.6 billion, which was in line with Wall Street expectations.

37,"  Oct 22 Abbott Laboratories and Mylan Inc  on Wednesday said they would go ahead with their $5.3 billion deal in which Mylan will buy part of Abbott's overseas generics business and set up headquarters in the Netherlands, but they tweaked the terms of the transaction.The move comes after the U.S. Treasury on Sept. 22 made changes to the corporate tax rules that govern such ""inversion"" merger deals, in which companies move their operations to countries with lower taxes than in the United States. The new rules raise the bar for this tax treatment and also make it harder to reap other tax benefits of an inversion.About ten U.S. companies had deals in the works when the Treasury changed the rules. Some, including Salix Pharmaceuticals and former Abbott business Abbvie, pulled out of their own inversion-based deals, while others decided to go forward with their deals.Investors and analysts were not certain where Abbott and Mylan would fall. ""The positive takeaway is that Abbott still plans to close its deal with Mylan in the first quarter of 2015, despite the pressure on inversions from the U.S. Treasury, and some walking away by other companies from inversions,"" said Jeff Windau, an analyst with Edward Jones.

46,"  NEW YORK/SANTIAGO Dec 22 A former board member of Chile's CFR Pharmaceuticals SA was charged Monday by U.S. regulators with insider trading on information regarding Abbott Laboratories' $2.9 billion acquisition of CFR earlier this year.The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil lawsuit accusing Juan Cruz Bilbao Hormaeche of reaping more than $10.1 million of profit by trading on key non-public information he learned from CFR board meetings ahead of the deal, which was announced in May and finalized in September.The lawsuit also charged a business associate of Bilbao, Tomas Andres Hurtado Rourke, with processing securities transactions for Bilbao and himself through an offshore entity. Rourke earned nearly $500,000 in profits, according to the SEC.Bilbao, 55, and Hurtado, 40, are Chilean citizens who live in Santiago, according to the lawsuit. Lawyers for the two men could not immediately be identified.Bilbao is the president of banking and insurance company Consorcio Financiero SA, and Hurtado is a director of the company's banking unit, according to Consorcio's website. Representatives at Consorcio were not immediately available to comment.According to the SEC, Bilbao first learned of Abbott's confidential offer to acquire CFR at a board meeting March 10. Between March 12 and May 7, Bilbao used Hurtado to purchase more than 700,000 American depositary shares of CFR for a total of $14.35 million in the name of a British Virgin Islands entity, Somerton Resources Limited, the lawsuit said.Hurtado also bought $700,000 of CFR shares, it said. Bilbao and Hurtado tendered their shares after CFR's stock price rose following Abbott's announcement of the acquisition, the SEC said.The SEC is seeking an order freezing Bilbao, Hurtado and Somerton's assets and requiring them to be repatriated.Spokespeople for Abbott did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The case is U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission v.

Under the latest offer, Bidvest would pay about 6 billion rand ($515 million), or 52 rand per share, which represents a 3.6 percent premium to Adcock's closing price on Friday.Shares in Adcock jumped as much as 6.6 percent during the session. By 1410 GMT, the stock had given up some its gains to trade 4.3 percent higher at 52.34 rand.""OPPORTUNISTIC""  Adcock reported a 38 percent rise to 83.8 cents in half-year headline earnings per share on Monday, a sign that a turnaround plan that include cost cuts and adopting a centralised business model is gaining traction.It has not commented on the Bidvest approach.""Considering the potential turnaround of the company, I think it is definitely an opportunistic bid,"" said Simon Mather, analyst at Barclays, who has a ""neutral"" rating on the stock. ""In a more optimistic scenario about the prospects of Adcock, we got to a fair value of 69.5 rand per share provided management is able to orchestrate a meaningful turnaround of the business.""Bidvest's offer values Adcock at around 9.1 billion rand -- below its enterprise value of about 10 billion rand, according to Thomson Reuters data.Bidvest has been trying to take control of Adcock since 2013, seeing an opportunity to turn around an underperforming company and add painkillers and cough syrups to its stable of products.Last year, it sank a 12.8 billion rand, or 74.5 rand per share, takeover offer for Adcock from CFR by building a blocking stake that gave it the current holding.In March 2013, Bidvest offered a 10 percent premium for a 60 percent stake in Adcock, a bid spurned by Adcock's board at the time as opportunistic.($1 = 11.7232 rand)   (Additional reporting by Helen Nyambura-Mwaura; Editing by Jane Merriman and Keith Weir)",2015-02-23,ABT,"Mon Feb 23, 2015 | 9:11am EST",UPDATE 3-Bidvest makes $515 million bid for rest of Adcock Ingram,http://www.reuters.com//article/adcock-ma-bidvest-group-idUSL5N0VX0PC20150223?type=companyNews

The company said it still expects to launch a generic version of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd's  top-selling multiple sclerosis drug, Copaxone, in the second half of the year, despite a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in favor of Teva in January.Net profit attributable to the company's common shareholders rose to $189.2 million, or 47 cents per share, in the fourth quarter, from $180.2 million, or 45 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding special items, the company earned $1.05 per share, matching the average analyst estimate, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Revenue rose 15 percent to $2.08 billion, edging past the Wall Street estimate of about $2.06 billion.

65,"  * Drugmaker taking personalised healthcare beyond cancer* Deal with Abbott to develop diagnostic for asthma drug* Tie-up with Montreal scientists on heart disease genesBy Ben HirschlerLONDON, May 13 AstraZeneca is diving deeper into personalised healthcare with two projects that move the concept beyond cancer into respiratory disorders and heart disease.Personalised or precision medicine, which tailors treatment to a patient's genetic profile, is an increasing focus for drug companies, especially after an initiative from U.S. President Barack Obama in January.Until now, however, the focus has been on cancer, where genetic mutations are well-known drivers of disease. ""The time is now right to extend the personalised healthcare approach and the benefits it brings to all of our therapy areas,"" Ruth March, who heads the initiative at the British drugmaker, told reporters.""Up to now the science of personalised healthcare has been slower to reach those common disease areas such as cardiovascular and respiratory disease.""To redress the balance, AstraZeneca said on Wednesday it had signed two deals, one with Abbott Laboratories for a diagnostic test to accompany an experimental asthma drug and another with Canadian scientists on genes associated with heart disease. Abbott will develop a diagnostic test to identify patients with severe asthma who are most likely to benefit from AstraZeneca's new antibody drug tralokinumab, which is in final-stage Phase III clinical tests.To date, there are no such approved blood tests for use in asthma.A separate tie-up with the Montreal Heart Institute will screen samples from up to 80,000 patients for genetic traits linked to cardiovascular disease and diabetes, in a programme that may help doctors work out which patient should take which drug. By 2020, AstraZeneca expects half of its new drug launches will come with so-called companion diagnostics to identify those patients most likely to benefit from different treatments.This approach is already used in cancer, with Roche's  breast cancer drug Herceptin and AstraZeneca's lung cancer medicine Iressa, for example, given to patients with particular genetic profiles.Cancer has long been a key area for AstraZeneca, which was the target of a $118 billion attempted takeover last year by Pfizer.Along with rivals in the field, AstraZeneca will showcase its latest cancer drug advances at the May 29 to June 2 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) annual meeting in Chicago.Industry analysts say most attention will be focused on the latest clinical data on AstraZeneca's combination of two experimental medicines, MEDI4736 and tremelimumab, in treating lung cancer.

66,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, May 18 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has downgraded Abbott Laboratories'  (Abbott) long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) by one notch to 'A' and revised  the Rating Outlook to Stable from Negative. In addition, the company's  short-term IDR has been affirmed at 'F1'. Abbott had $8.9 billion in outstanding debt at March 31, 2015. A full list of  Fitch's ratings actions follows at the end of this release.  KEY RATING DRIVERS -- Fitch expects Abbott will operate with debt leverage (total debt/EBITDA) of  1.7x to 1.9x, consistent with an 'A' credit rating for this issuer.    -- Abbott's diversified product portfolio is positioned to deliver  mid-single-digit organic growth with incrementally improving margins in the  intermediate term. -- The company's Nutrition, Diagnostics, Medical Devices and Established  Pharmaceuticals segments are expected to benefit from the growth in emerging  markets.   -- Abbott's ongoing focus on new product introductions across virtually all of  its business segments bodes well for growth and margins. -- The company faces challenges regarding reimbursement for some of its  products, as well as near-term adverse foreign exchange movements. -- Fitch anticipates that Abbott's efforts to improve gross and operating  margins will continue to yield results, more than offsetting the aforementioned  headwinds.  -- Fitch forecasts Abbott generating relatively strong free cash flow (FCF) of  $1.4 billion - $1.6 billion during 2015. -- Fitch believes that Abbott will focus primarily on shareholders when  deploying cash, balancing the return opportunities of share repurchases with  acquisitions, while steadily increasing its dividend.  --Fitch expects that Abbott will maintain adequate liquidity through cash  generation, bank credit and access to the capital markets. Leverage Consistent with 'A' Rating: Abbott's current leverage (total  debt/EBITDA) of 1.9x and above 1.5x for the most recent five quarters is more  consistent with an 'A' credit rating for its operating profile. Fitch now  expects that Abbott will balance its investment needs with shareholder-focused  activities, so that it operates with leverage of 1.7x-1.9x. Adequate growth,  margin support and solid FCF (cash flow from operations minus capital  expenditures and dividends) should mitigate the need for significant increases  in the company's total debt. Stable Operations: Fitch forecasts that Abbott's diversified product portfolio  will continue to produce mid-single-digit organic growth in the intermediate  term, given the strength of its product offerings and its geographic mix.  However, adverse foreign exchange movements will likely hamper reported growth  in the near term, although margins should remain fairly insulated from the  trend. Revenue growth and margin support should provide for solid FCF  generation. Emerging Markets Supporting Growth: Fitch expects the majority of Abbott's  growth will continue to come from emerging markets. Abbott expects to generate  roughly 50% of its revenues from emerging markets in 2015, fueled by the strong  growth in those markets, as well as the divestiture of its developed-market  Established Pharmaceuticals business. Nutrition, Diagnostics and Established  Pharmaceuticals, in particular, should benefit from the rapidly growing middle  class.  Nearly all purchases in these markets are paid for by consumers. This is in  contrast to developed markets, where the vast majority of purchases involve  third-party payers. As such, rising disposable income is an important driver of  demand in these markets. As evidence of the company's commitment to emerging  markets, it opened two nutritional manufacturing plants last year in China and  India, plus a pilot plant in Singapore. New Product Flow: Abbott continues to refresh its product portfolio across all  of its business segments, helping to drive growth through market expansion  and/or market penetration. Newer products with improved efficacy and safety  profiles often garner value-added prices, offering support for margins. Many of  the company's launches are tailored to specific geographies. For example Abbott  recently launched new infant nutritional formulas (Similac QINTI and Eleva) in  China.  In the self-testing diabetic market, the company launched FreeStyle Libre, an  improved blood glucose monitor. Abbott is developing and launching its  next-generation diagnostic platforms, including the IRIDICA (molecular  diagnostic platform to quickly detect and identify the causative organisms  causing infections in patients) launch in Europe.  MitraClip, a medical device for mitral regurgitation, is relatively new and is  gaining traction in the market. XIENCE Alpine, a drug-eluting stent for treating  de novo chronic total coronary occlusions, was recently launched in the U.S.   TECNIS Multifocal Low Add is an intraocular lens with an improved ability to  reduce color distortion at near focus and at a distance. Select Market Headwinds: Abbott faces a few challenges in select geographic  markets, including restrictive reimbursement rates for diabetic supplies in the  U.S. Restrained budgets in Europe pose headwinds, although they appear to be  moderating. Unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements are expected to hamper  reported top-line growth. However, the negative effect on margins is muted,  given that the company has significant operations (costs) in the same  geographies that are experiencing currency devaluation. Durable Margin Improvement Fitch anticipates that Abbott will continue to focus on driving efficiencies  across its business segments, in an effort to support/improve margins. During  2014, the company made progress in improving the cost structure in its  Nutrition, Established Pharmaceutical and Diagnostic segments, while also taking  out some general and administrative corporate costs. Fitch believes the margin  improvements are largely sustainable over the intermediate term and bode well  for cash generation and debt leverage.  Solid FCF: Fitch estimates that Abbott will generate solid cash flow of roughly  $1.6 billion - $1.7 billion in 2015, driven by incremental revenue growth and  moderately improving margins. Capital expenditures and dividends are expected to  steadily increase during the forecast period, as the company invests for growth  and aims to satisfy shareholders' return requirements. FCF should be sufficient  to fund moderate share repurchases and targeted acquisitions.  Growth/Shareholder-Focused Cash Deployment: Fitch believes Abbott will be  opportunistic with cash deployment as it weighs potential returns for  shareholders. As such the company will likely remain acquisitive, focusing on  companies or device platforms that offer innovation and growth, as technological  advancement in the device sector remains relatively fragmented. Abbott may also  consider targets that offer further expansion opportunities into favorable  geographies. Share repurchases will likely continue, especially in the absence  of viable acquisition targets, and the company will likely pursue a policy of  consistently increasing its dividend. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case for Abbott include: -- Low-single-digit reported revenue growth with organic growth in nutrional  products and pharmaceuticals being offset by negative foreign exchange rate  effects.  -- Gradually improving margins, particularly in Nutritional Products and  Diagnostics, given Abbott's efforts to improve efficiencies in these two  segments. --Annual FCF (cash flow from operations minus capital expenditures minus  dividends) of $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion during 2015. --Targeted acquisitions with no strategic, transformative transactions. --Continued share repurchases, especially in the absence of viable acquisition  targets. --Leverage to range between 1.7x-1.9x during the next few years driven by a  growth/shareholder-return capital deployment posture offsetting a steadily  improving operating profile.  LIQUIDITY Fitch expects Abbott to maintain adequate liquidity, as the company had  approximately $9.9 billion in cash and short-term investments at March 31, 2015  and its unused $5 billion revolving credit facility that expires in July 2019.  However, the company had roughly $2.9 billion in short-term borrowings backed by  the credit facility. Abbott generated approximately $920 million in FCF during  the latest 12-month (LTM) period ended March31, 2015. In addition, the company  should continue to have ample access to public debt markets. At March 31, 2015, Abbott had approximately $8.9 billion in debt outstanding  (including the $2.9 billion in short-term borrowings). Fitch believes the  company's debt maturities are manageable, with no significant maturities until  2019. Fitch's forecasts assume that Abbott will refinance most of these  maturities with the proceeds from new debt issuances. RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: While Fitch does not anticipate an upgrade in the near to intermediate  term, future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  positive rating action include the following: -- Abbott committing to and operating with leverage stronger than 1.5x;  --Maintaining relatively stable operations and solid FCF that would support a  lower-leveraged capital structure. Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  negative rating action include the following: -- Debt above 2.0x EBITDA without the prospect for timely deleveraging, which  could result from a scenario in which revenue and margins are significantly  stressed (more than Fitch anticipates); -- Resulting FCF weakens and capital deployment is not adjusted to reduce the  company's need for debt financing; -- Significant debt-financed share repurchases or acquisitions in the near term  could prompt a negative rating action, as Abbott has limited flexibility  associated with the company's current leverage. RATING ACTIONS Fitch has downgraded Abbott's ratings as follows:   --Long-term IDR to 'A' from 'A+';  --Senior unsecured debt rating to 'A' from 'A+'; --Bank loan rating to 'A' from 'A+'. Fitch has affirmed Abbott's short-term ratings as follows: --Short-term IDR at 'F1'; --Commercial paper rating at 'F1'. The Rating Outlook on the long-term ratings is Stable.

69,"  * New drugs join price control list of more than 500 drugs* Abbott, GSK, Lupin and Ipca among firms affected   (Adds details on government's position, results of new study )By Zeba SiddiquiMUMBAI, July 16 India has extended price caps to an additional 39 drugs ranging from commonly used diabetes treatments to antibiotics, in the government's latest effort to improve the affordability of medicines. Wide-ranging price cuts over the past year have hit several drugmakers in India and have been opposed by many in the industry, who say drug prices in the country are already among the lowest in the world. The new drugs join a price control list that covers more than 500 drugs.The latest move will include medicines made by foreign drugmakers such as Abbott Laboratories and GlaxoSmithKline Plc, as well as domestic firms such as Lupin Ltd, Cadila Healthcare Ltd and Ipca Ltd. The move comes after a parliamentary committee said in April that the scope of price control needed to be enlarged even further. In India, the majority of people live on less than $2 a day and health insurance is scarce. But a study conducted by healthcare research firm IMS and sponsored by the main business association of multinational drugmakers operating in India argues that price controls are not an effective strategy to improve healthcare access for Indian patients.Price caps benefit high-income patients rather than the low-income patients and put pressure on profit margins for small and mid-sized companies, said the study, which was released on Tuesday.(Reporting by Zeba Siddiqui; Editing by Clara Ferreira Marques and Edwina Gibbs)",2015-07-16,ABT,"Thu Jul 16, 2015 | 1:52am EDT",UPDATE 1-India expands medicine price control list to include 39 more drugs,http://www.reuters.com//article/india-drug-prices-idUSL4N0ZW1SU20150716?type=companyNews

74,"   By Vidya L Nathan  Drugmaker Abbott Laboratories (ABT.N), knocking down a report in the Financial Times, denied on Thursday that it was preparing a bid for medical device maker St Jude Medical Inc (STJ.N).The FT, citing people familiar with the matter, reported that Abbott has been working with advisers for several weeks to line up financing for a $25 billion cash and stock bid for St. Paul, Minnesota-based St Jude. St Jude's shares, which jumped 15 percent premarket trading following the report, were up 3.4 percent at $71.72 in early trading.The company had a market value of about $19.5 billion as of Wednesday's close. ""I can tell you that we are not pursuing an offer for St Jude,"" Abbott spokesman Scott Stoffel told Reuters.St Jude did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A source familiar with Abbott's thinking said he did not believe a deal was seriously contemplated, while Evercore ISI analyst Vijay Kumar said Abbott was more likely to do medium-sized deals than a big transaction.Abbott Chief Executive Miles White said last month that he was interested in acquisitions, including in the device sector,  but would be cautious because a flurry of deals in the healthcare industry had pushed up valuations.

Abbott Laboratories also has a listed subsidiary in India, Abbott India Ltd.Three months ago, Nestle was forced to withdraw its Maggi instant noodles from Indian shelves because the food safety authority banned the snack after its tests showed excess lead.A court later overturned the ban in a partial victory for the Swiss food giant, but the allegations hurt the company's reputation and that of the country's regulators, who operate with few staff and poorly equipped facilities.In the latest dispute, the laboratory found that a sample of Phensedyl contained more than twice the labeled amount of codeine, according to several state drug officials and correspondence between regulators and Abbott seen by Reuters.Phensedyl sales are estimated to be more than 3 percent of Abbott's $1 billion India revenue. The sales are dwarfed by Abbott's global annual sales of over $20 billion, but, as the Nestle case shows, fallout from safety scandals is unpredictable.The excessive codeine, an opium derivative, would violate Indian drugs law. It triggered a ""show cause"" notice against Abbott, which was sent in March by the drug regulator in Himachal Pradesh state, where Phensedyl is manufactured.In its response in late April, Abbott denied the allegations and urged regulators to not take any action. Abbott said it had found nothing unusual in its own and third party testing of a retained sample from the same batch of Phensedyl. The company also asked regulators to give it more information about the source of the suspect sample and the manner in which it was collected, so that it could establish whether it was genuine and proper process was followed.""We are awaiting response from the authorities,"" the company said in answer to Reuters questions.DRUG SEIZURE The original test was carried out by West Bengal after Phensedyl bottles were seized near the border with Bangladesh, said Samit Saha, a state drug inspector involved in the case.Codeine-based cough syrups are banned in Bangladesh, and smuggling is rife as people profit from higher prices there compared to India. According to a copy of the inspector's report, the sample contained 21.37 mg of codeine per 5 ml dosage, instead of 10 mg specified on the label.Saha said two other samples from different batches, however, showed normal codeine levels.Excessive consumption of cough syrup with high levels of codeine can lead to health implications such as sedation, behavioral changes and drug dependence, said Amitabh Parti, a doctor at Fortis Memorial Research Institute.In February, West Bengal listed the potentially tainted batch as ""not of standard quality"" in a monthly publication. The bulletin, which is posted on the regulator's website, is supposed to alert consumers and pharmacies in the state to suspect drugs. But the West Bengal drug controller, C. M. Ghosh, said he does not have the resources to follow it up. STATES OF CONFUSION  Navneet Marwaha, the drug controller in Himachal Pradesh, said in an interview that Phensedyl, which accounts for about a third of the Indian cough syrup market, is often copied by counterfeiters. He said Abbott's stocks of codeine were accounted for.""They (Abbott) are saying 'show us the sample so we can see whether it is genuine.' They have not been provided with the sample,"" Marwaha said.He added that it was up to West Bengal to provide the information to Abbott.West Bengal's Ghosh said it was Himachal Pradesh's prerogative and the company can only challenge the test's findings at a federal drug lab with a court's permission. Safety breaches and scares are common in India. According to a 2012 parliamentary report, nearly one in 22 locally produced drug samples is of sub-standard quality in India.India has just 1,500 drug inspectors responsible for more than 10,000 factories, supplying medicines for a population of 1.2 billion and exporting to nearly 200 countries. Ghosh said he has 140 drug inspectors to monitor more than 50,000 pharmacies in the state.The federal government wants to improve regulation of the key sector, and plans to spend $263 million in the next three years to strengthen the national and state regulatory system with additional equipment and staff and new laboratories.

87,"  Abbott Laboratories Inc (ABT.N) reported better-than-expected quarterly sales as demand rose for its generic drugs in emerging markets, including Latin America and China. Abbott said on Wednesday sales of its generic drugs grew in double digits in emerging markets, helped by the acquisition of Chilean drugmaker CFR Pharmaceuticals SA last year.Sales of generic drugs rose to $961 million in the third quarter, contributing about 19 percent to Abbott's total sales. Revenue from its nutritional products business, its largest, rose 6.5 percent. The business accounts for more than a third of the company's total sales. Abbott also raised the lower end of its full-year profit forecast range and cut the upper end, to $2.14-$2.16 per share from $2.10-$2.20. The developer of anesthetic Pentothal said total revenue rose 2 percent to $5.15 billion in the quarter ended Sept. 30, while net profit rose 8 percent to $580 million, or 38 cents per share. Excluding items, Abbott earned 54 cents per share. Analysts on average had expected a profit of 53 cents per share and revenue of $5.14 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Abbott's shares closed at $41.74 on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday.

88,"   By Nate Raymond | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Oct 23 A former board member of Chile's CFR Pharmaceuticals SA has reached a $13.2 million settlement to resolve charges by a U.S. regulator that he engaged in insider trading ahead of Abbott Laboratories'  $2.9 billion acquisition of the drug company.The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, in papers filed on Friday in Manhattan federal court, said the sum would be paid by a British Virgin Islands entity through which Juan Cruz Bilbao Hormaeche of Chile conducted the alleged insider trading.The SEC also agreed to drop charges against a business associate of Bilbao, Tomas Andres Hurtado Rourke, who it said placed the trades in an account of the entity, Somerton Resources Limited, and made trades in his own brokerage account. The trading took place after Bilbao participated in a March 2014 meeting via telephone in which CFR's board considered a confidential proposal by Abbott to buy the company.The announcement by Abbott days later of an agreement to buy CFR in a $2.9 billion deal enabled Bilbao and Hurtado to reap about $10.6 million in illicit profits, the SEC said. The SEC filed its lawsuit in December against Bilbao, the president of banking and insurance company Consorcio Financiero SA, and Hurtado, who was a director of the company's banking unit. Both men were Chilean citizens living in Santiago, the lawsuit said. The SEC subsequently obtained a court order freezing $42.8 million of Bilbao's and Somerton's assets.Lawyers for Bilbao and Hurtado did not respond to requests for comment.The case is U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission v.

90,"   By Aditya Kalra and Paritosh Bansal | NEW DELHI  NEW DELHI Indian regulators are privately pressuring major drug firms to better police how they sell popular codeine-based cough syrups to tackle smuggling and addiction, a move that is reducing supplies of a medicine doctors say is an effective treatment.India's Cipla stopped making the product last year owing to regulatory demands, and U.S.-based Abbott Laboratories and Pfizer have had to reduce batch sizes by up to half, cutting how much medicine their factories can produce.But they are pushing back against other demands, a Reuters review of correspondence between companies and regulators showed, including selling one batch to only one buyer and printing labels that specify where the drug would be sold.Regulators want to make it easier for law enforcement agencies to track cough syrup abuse in the country and bottles smuggled to neighbouring Bangladesh, where it was banned in the 1980s but is still sought by addicts.Retailers worried about liability from potential abuse by people addicted to the opiate codeine are in some cases refusing to stock the cough syrup, said J.S. Shinde, president of pharmaceutical lobby group All India Organization of Chemists and Druggists.    Sales of the drug in India fell 4 percent to 121 million bottles in the year through August, and 15 percent in the year before, according to IMS Health, a healthcare statistics provider.For drug regulators, the challenge is to strike a balance.""Any non-therapeutic usage is a concern, but you have to weigh the risks versus benefits,"" said an official at the federal drugs controller in New Delhi.RISING COSTS According to an industry executive, the likes of Pfizer and Abbott, who control most of the $103 million market for the drug, face a ""significant"" increase in costs as plants run well below capacity because of changes demanded of them.And the regulatory regime could get tougher.According to minutes of a July meeting of state and federal drug regulators, there was a recommendation to ban the sale of the syrup altogether because of ""rampant misuse and its illegal exports to neighbouring countries.""""A large number of regulators were in favour of strict control,"" said Akun Sabharwal, drugs controller for Telangana, who attended the meeting. The federal drugs official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said an outright ban would not be easy to impose, given the medicine's importance. Abbott estimates roughly 60 million people suffer from regular dry cough in India.Pfizer's India unit said in a statement the company takes all steps to maintain the highest standards of regulatory compliance, including supply-chain audits.Abbott India said they believed existing Indian drug laws were adequate to control the abuse and the company had taken steps to support enforcement agencies.RUINED LIVES Last year, the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB) billed the abuse of medicines containing narcotics and their smuggling from India among the ""greatest drug-related challenges"" facing South Asia.About 83,000 bottles of codeine-based cough syrups were seized in India in the six months through March. In meetings with companies, Indian regulators called the ""menace of abuse"" a ""growing concern"".Abuse is particularly common in Bangladesh. At a treatment centre in the capital Dhaka, tales abound of ruined careers and family struggles. A 40-year-old former banker at the Bangladesh Rehabilitation and Assistance Center for Addicts said his addiction was so bad he felt he loved cough syrup more than his four-year-old son.""I felt I must recover from this menace,"" he said, requesting anonymity because of the shame associated with addiction.The regulatory crackdown in recent years appears to have curtailed smuggling. About 750,000 bottles were seized in Bangladesh in 2014, 24 percent lower than 2013, the INCB said.Still, a fifth of Bangladesh's estimated 4 million drug users are addicted to such syrups, said Sayedur Rahman, a professor at the Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University.Inside Bangladesh, the cost of a bottle has more than tripled, indicating scarcity. Still, drug officials say the problem is underreported and more should be done.Graphic: Codeine seizures in Bangladesh, click link.reuters.com/sad85w Video: Bangladesh's codeine cough syrup crisis, click reut.rs/1ZBxqnhINCREASING PRESSURE The latest crackdown on companies dates back to at least February 2014, the review shows.Indian narcotics officials told companies to take several measures, including reducing batch sizes and printing where it would be sold on the label.They also asked them to sell drugs from one batch to one stockist only, a measure the executive said was impractical.That summer, regulators temporarily held back Cipla's allocation of codeine, manufactured solely in government factories, after the company failed to inform the government about steps it had taken to comply with the directive.Cipla said it never received the request for information.A Cipla spokeswoman said the company stopped making the drug last year after ""considering the business environment ... and the fact that this product was regulated by multiple agencies.""At another meeting in October, government officials again pressured pharmaceutical companies to comply with their demands.In August this year, regulators sent a letter asking for updates on further steps they had taken, an industry executive said.

91,"   By Susan Kelly | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Dec 2 Top medical device makers are investing heavily in a new way to treat leaky mitral heart valves, a serious condition affecting millions of people, but it will be at least four years before the technology reaches the U.S. market.The minimally invasive treatment, called transcatheter mitral valve replacement, lets a doctor implant an artificial valve using a catheter inserted through the arteries. The technique spares the patient from open-heart surgery, the traditional approach to valve replacement that is considered too risky for many people, especially the elderly.Medtronic Plc, Abbott Laboratories, Edwards Lifesciences Corp and HeartWare International Inc  in recent months have spent a total of $2 billion to buy young companies developing versions of the technology.Boston Scientific Corp has an option to buy an early-stage company developing a mitral replacement system.Nearly 6 million people in the United States may suffer from mitral disease, and Wall Street analysts say it could be the next multibillion-dollar market. But the rush by leading device makers into mitral replacement has raised questions for some investors and heart doctors.Fewer than 100 people worldwide have undergone the procedure, and it is far from clear whether this technique will be significantly better than other treatments or how many patients would be candidates for the surgery.""All these things are still several years away, especially from the U.S. market,"" said Jeff Jonas, a portfolio manager with Gabelli & Co, which holds shares of Medtronic. Mitral disease is ""something that very gradually develops. A ton of people may have it, but a smaller number have it at a life-threatening stage."" The mitral valve helps regulate blood flow from the heart's left atrium into the left ventricle. Mitral valve regurgitation occurs when the valve does not close properly to prevent backflow. It can cause extreme fatigue and shortness of breath and increase the risk of stroke, heart failure and death.""If we have a way where we can replace the valve without surgery, that is where all the excitement is,"" said Dr. Mathew Williams, chief of cardiac surgery at New York University's Langone Medical Center.REPAIR, OR REPLACE Abbott's MitraClip is the only minimally invasive product on the U.S. market for the condition. It repairs, rather than replaces, a patient's own mitral valve. It is approved for a limited group of severely ill patients and its performance improves when certain anatomical characteristics are present. Annual sales are about $250 million worldwide. Abbott sees room for both repair and replacement in treating mitral disease and projects strong double-digit annual growth for the MitraClip over the next several years, said John Capek, a company executive vice president.Rivals Edwards and Medtronic have found huge success with a minimally invasive technique for replacing malfunctioning aortic valves, and some see that as a benchmark for the mitral market.Edwards projects the aortic market will grow to $3 billion in worldwide sales in five years, double its 2014 sales, driven by advancements in the technology and approvals to treat additional patient populations. Some Wall Street analysts, including Morgan Stanley's David Lewis, predict the mitral market could be two to three times larger because more patients have mitral valve disease than aortic.""What you've got is this huge market opportunity. But the challenges are huge, and it's going to take some time,"" said Edwards Chief Executive Michael Mussallem. Edwards may be the first to launch a transcatheter replacement product in Europe, possibly by late 2017, with a U.S. approval possible by 2019.Replacing a mitral valve is particularly tricky, partly due to the valve's asymmetrical structure, which varies by patient and is more difficult to address than the circular aortic valve, according to doctors. It can also be tougher to guide a mitral valve to the heart through the arteries because of its larger size, and harder to reach the original valve due to its location.Results will not come until the end of 2017 from a key study enrolling up to 430 patients to determine whether repairing the valve using Abbott's MitraClip is better than medications alone.Doctors say the research could bolster the case for minimally invasive approaches if the results support the procedure's effectiveness. Patients with mitral valve regurgitation often take medicines used to treat heart failure, but these do not correct the valve condition.""It is a very interesting space, and there is a need for mitral valve replacement,"" said Dr. Saibal Kar, director of interventional cardiac research at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. But he cautioned it is much too early to predict it will become the industry's next multi-billion-dollar market.""It is unbridled enthusiasm,"" he said.

96,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, February 02 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has placed Abbott Laboratories'  (Abbott) ratings on Negative Rating Watch following its announced intention to  acquire Alere, Inc. (ALR). Abbott had $8.4 billion in outstanding debt at Sept. 30, 2015. A full list of  Fitch's ratings actions follows at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS Sound Acquisition, Increased Leverage: Abbott plans to acquire ALR for roughly  $5.8 billion cash and approximately $2.6 billion of assumed net debt. The  company intends to finance the transaction with debt. Fitch believes the  acquisition makes sense strategically, as the acquisition will increase  Abbotts's presence in point of care diagnostics and has prospects to expand  Alere's products in international markets. Abbott already has a strong position  in the medical diagnostics market and a demonstrable record of successfully  acquiring and integrating acquisitions. Abbott expects to achieve nearly $500 million in pre-tax synergies in 2019, and  more thereafter. Despite the favorable strategic and operational aspects of  adding Alere's products to Abbott's existing portfolio, Fitch expects leverage  to increase significantly because of the transaction. Pro forma leverage could  approach or exceed 3x immediately after the acquisition close, if Abbott does  not pay down any debt beforehand. As such, the degree to which and the pace at  which the company deleverages will factor heavily in Fitch's rating  determination for Abbott. A downgrade could occur if leverage does not decrease  to below or around 2x within 18-24 months after the deal closes. Based on its  operating forecast for the combined company, Fitch believes Abbott will generate  enough free cash flow (FCF) to accomplish this level of debt reduction, but  uncertain as to the company's commitment to deploy capital for this purpose.  Stable Operations: Fitch forecasts that Abbott's diversified product portfolio  will continue to produce low- to mid-single-digit organic growth in the  intermediate term, given the strength of its product offerings and its  geographic mix. However, adverse foreign exchange movements will likely hamper  reported growth in the near term. Revenue growth and relatively stable margins  should provide for solid FCF generation. Emerging Market Tailwinds with Some Headwinds:  Fitch expects the majority of Abbott's growth will continue to come from  emerging markets. Abbott will generate roughly 50% of its revenues from emerging  markets in 2016, due to strong demand-driven growth in those markets. Nutrition,  Diagnostics and Established Pharmaceuticals, in particular, should benefit from  the rapidly growing middle class in these markets, and nearly all purchases are  paid for by consumers. This is in contrast to developed markets, where the vast  majority of purchases of prescription pharmaceuticals, clinical diagnostic tests  and medical devices involve third-party payers. As such, rising disposable  income is an important driver of demand in these markets.  Abbott faces a few challenges in select geographic markets, including  restrictive reimbursement rates for diabetic supplies in the U.S. and  macroeconomic distress in Venezuela. Restrained budgets in Europe pose  headwinds, although they appear to be moderating. Unfavorable foreign exchange  rate movements will likely continue to hamper reported top-line growth in the  near term. However, the negative effect on margins is muted given that the  company has significant operations (costs) in the same geographies that are  experiencing currency devaluation. New Product Flow: Abbott continues to refresh its product portfolio across all  of its business segments, helping to drive growth through market expansion  and/or market penetration. Newer products with improved efficacy and safety  profiles often garner value-added prices, offering support for margins. The  company often launches new products that are tailored to specific geographies.  Durable Margin Improvement Fitch anticipates that Abbott will continue to focus on driving efficiencies  across its business segments, in an effort to improve margins. The company made  progress in improving the cost structure in its Nutrition and Diagnostic  segments, while also taking out some general and administrative corporate costs.  Fitch believes the margin improvements are largely sustainable over the  intermediate term and bode well for cash generation and debt leverage.  Solid FCF: Fitch estimates that Abbott will generate solid cash flow of at least  $1 billion in 2016, driven by incremental organic revenue growth and moderately  improving margins. Capital expenditures and dividends are expected to steadily  increase during the forecast period as the company invests for growth. FCF  should be sufficient to fund what Fitch expects will be moderate share  repurchases and increasing dividends.  KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case for Abbot Laboratories include:  --Leverage to increase significantly in the near- to intermediate-term, if the  Alere acquisition is completed. --Low single-digit reported revenue growth with organic growth offset by  negative foreign exchange rate effects.  --Incrementally improving margins, particularly in Nutritional Products and  Diagnostics, given Abbott's efforts to improve efficiencies in these two  segments. --Annual FCF (cash flow from operations minus capital expenditures minus  dividends) of at least $1 billion during 2016. --Continued share repurchases and dividend increases. RATING SENSITIVITIES Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  negative rating action include: --Debt above around 2x EBITDA within 18-24 months after the Alere acquisition; --Significant operational stress, which may include an inability to successfully  integrate the planned Alere acquisition and achieve expected synergies; --Resulting FCF weakens to a level where the company cannot meaningfully reduce  debt following the Alere acquisition.  Positive: Fitch does not anticipate an upgrade in the near- to  intermediate-term. LIQUIDITY Fitch expects Abbott to maintain adequate liquidity, as the company had  approximately $6.1 billion in cash and short-term investments at Sept. 30, 2015.  The company has an unused $5 billion revolving credit facility that expires in  July 2019, although Abbott had roughly $2.4 billion in short-term borrowings  backed by the credit facility. Abbott generated approximately $809 million in  FCF during the latest 12-month period ended Sept. 30, 2015. In addition, the  company should continue to have ample access to public debt markets. At March 31, 2015, Abbott had approximately $8.4 billion in debt outstanding  (including the $2.4 billion in short-term borrowings). Fitch believes the  company's debt maturities are manageable, with no significant maturities until  2019.  FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Abbott Laboratories Fitch has placed the following ratings on Negative Watch:  --Long-term IDR 'A';  --Bank loan rating 'A'; --Senior unsecured debt rating 'A'; --Short-term IDR 'F1'; --Commercial paper program 'F1'.

97,"   By Zeba Siddiqui and Aditya Kalra | MUMBAI, March 13  MUMBAI, March 13 A powerful antibiotic combination that is marketed in India by U.S. pharmaceutical giant Abbott Laboratories is among 344 drug combinations that have been banned by the Indian health authorities.A Reuters investigation revealed in December that a unit of Abbott in India was selling a combination of the antibiotics cefixime and azithromycin without approval from the central government. The combination is not approved for sale in major pharmaceutical markets, including the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, France and Japan.Abbott markets the combination of cefixime and azithromycin under the Zimnic AZ brand. At least 15 other companies in India manufacture and market the same combination under different brand names.A notice issued by the Indian Health Ministry at the weekend said that a government-appointed committee of experts had found that the banned combinations were ""likely to involve risk to human beings, whereas safer alternatives to the said drug are available.""The government notice said the ban would take effect immediately. Besides antibiotic combinations, the list of banned drugs also included analgesic combinations containing nimesulide, and codeine-based drugs.Anand Kadkol, a spokesman for Abbott in India, said the government announcement had been made late on Saturday and the company was ""reviewing the notification."" Fixed-dose combination drugs, or FDCs, combine two or more drugs in a single pill. In India, many pharmaceutical companies have obtained a license from a state to make FDCs, like Abbott's Zimnic AZ, and sell them across the country without the consent of the central government.India's drug regulators have made intermittent efforts over the years to shut down this avenue, but enforcement has been patchy and success limited. In 2007, for instance, the government instructed states to withdraw close to 300 combination drugs that were being sold without the approval of the central government. But drug companies and industry associations took the government to court and the order was stayed.D.G. Shah, the secretary general of the Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance, which represents 20 of India's biggest drugmakers, questioned the legality of the government's decision and said ""the lack of transparency raises doubts about the merits and the process followed or not followed."" Shah said companies that were affected by the ban could challenge the order in court.K.L. Sharma, a senior Health Ministry official who issued the ban order, was not immediately available for comment.In its notice, the government said a panel of experts had found that there was ""no therapeutic justification"" for any of the 344 FDCs it was banning. The panel reviewed 6,700 drug combinations. In its investigation, Reuters interviewed former and current medical representatives for Abbott who said Zimnic AZ had been promoted and administered as a treatment for a broad array of illnesses, including colds, fevers, urinary tract infections, drug-resistant typhoid and sexually transmitted diseases. Reuters also found chemists who were selling the drug to prevent post-operative infection and for respiratory problems.Medical experts told Reuters that combining cefixime and azithromycin was risky, and said that prescribing the combination for cold symptoms did not make sense.While combination drugs are used worldwide to improve patients' compliance, in India they have proliferated to the point where in 2014 nearly half the drugs on the market were combinations. Companies in India have increasingly added ingredients to existing drugs so they can promote a new product to doctors and chemists in an effort to increase market share.Doctors and health experts say the spread and misuse of antibiotic combinations may be contributing to antibiotic resistance in India. Some superbugs, which are strains of bacteria that have become resistant to antibiotics, have been found in patients who travelled from India to countries including the United States and Britain.(Editing by Peter Hirschberg.)",2016-03-13,ABT,"Sun Mar 13, 2016 | 8:17am EDT",Antibiotic combination marketed by Abbott in India on list of banned drugs,http://www.reuters.com//article/india-antibiotics-idUSL3N16L07Q?type=companyNews
98,"   By Aditya Kalra | NEW DELHI  NEW DELHI India has banned the manufacture and sale of more than 300 combination medicines, including two widely used cough syrups, being sold without government approval, a senior health ministry official said on Saturday.The move is aimed at curbing the misuse of such medicines in India, where nearly half the drugs sold in 2014 were so called ""fixed dose combinations.""Combination drugs are used worldwide to improve patients' compliance, as it is easier to get patients to take one drug rather than several. But inconsistent enforcement of drug laws in India has led to the proliferation of hundreds of such medicines entering the market based on approval from regulators of individual states, rather than the central government.In 2014, India set up a committee to review more than 6,000 combinations that had entered the market based only on state regulators' approval. Policymakers gave pharmaceutical companies a chance to retroactively prove the safety and efficacy of these drugs by submitting data on their drugs. The committee was tasked with classifying the drugs into rational, irrational, and those that need further studies, said KL Sharma, a joint secretary at the health ministry. ""Now based on responses (and) assessment of products, more than 300 drugs have been prohibited,"" he told Reuters. He did not name the medicines, but said an official notice announcing the ban would be issued ""in a few days."" The Drug Controller General of India was not immediately available to comment.The banned medicines include the codeine-based cough syrups Phensedyl and Corex, the Times of India said in a report earlier on Saturday, citing unnamed sources.Phensedyl, made by U.S. drug maker Abbott Laboratories, accounts for about a third of the Indian cough syrup market, and its sales are estimated to make up more than 3 percent of Abbott's $1 billion India revenue. Corex is sold by Pfizer Inc . Reuters reported last October that Indian regulators were privately pressuring drug firms to better police the selling of popular codeine-based cough syrups to tackle smuggling and addiction. Neither company responded to requests for comment on Saturday.Doctors and public health experts in India and abroad have warned that increasing use of antibiotic combinations in India may be contributing to antibiotic resistance. India is a particular concern as the market share of combination drugs versus single drugs is bigger than anywhere in the world. Reuters reported in December how a powerful antibiotic cocktail being marketed in India by a unit of Abbott and many other local companies did not carry approval from the central government.The combination was not approved for sale in major markets such as the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, France, Japan and Australia. Several medical experts said it did not make sense to prescribe the cocktail for cold symptoms. However, Abbott's former and current medical representatives said the combination was being promoted and administered as a treatment for a wide variety of illnesses, including colds and fevers.

99,"   By Susan Kelly  U.S. government scientists have raised questions about the potential risks to patients of heart attacks and blood clots from Abbott Laboratories' novel coronary stent that dissolves after it is implanted.Abbott is seeking U.S. approval to sell the stent, called Absorb, as an alternative to metal stents currently used to prop open arteries cleared of blockages. Unlike traditional stents that remain in place after implantation, Absorb is designed to  disappear within three years of the procedure.U.S. Food and Drug Administration staff, in documents released before an advisory panel meets on Tuesday to consider whether to recommend approval of the device, said they would ask the outside experts about data showing more heart attack and stent-related blood clots compared with Abbott’s drug-coated metal Xience stent. FDA said it also will ask the panel to address risks  associated with the device when used in smaller arteries.  A large clinical trial released in October concluded that the Absorb stent, which is made of a plastic similar to dissolving sutures, was comparable to Xience in overall safety and effectiveness. Although Xience appeared to be numerically better than Absorb at one year on a variety of secondary measures, the differences were not considered statistically significant.“These results are from physicians using a new therapy for the first time. Consequently, we expect them to improve with time and experience,” said Abbott spokesman Jonathon Hamilton.In the Absorb III clinical study, patients with small vessels comprised less than 20 percent of the total and experienced relatively low rates of adverse events even though many had known risk factors, including diabetes, Hamilton said. More than 125,000 patients already have been treated with Absorb in more than 100 countries where it is commercially available.If approved in the United States, Absorb would compete with Xience, the market-leading stent, and with Medtronic Plc’s Resolute stent and Boston Scientific's Synergy and Promus stents. Synergy’s polymer coating used to deliver a drug disappears over time, leaving a bare metal stent in place. Wells Fargo analyst Larry Biegelsen said he expects Absorb to get a positive recommendation from the advisory panel, followed by FDA approval later this year. “In the U.S., we estimate Absorb will capture about 5 percent of the total drug-eluting stent market, although our estimate may prove conservative if the post-approval data and experience with Absorb improves,” Biegelsen wrote in a note to clients.

Pfizer shares closed down 9 percent in Mumbai, before the stay order was issued.The court said the government had not issued Pfizer a ""show cause notice"" before banning the medicine, two lawyers for the drugmaker told Reuters, declining to be named.The next hearing by on Pfizer's plea is slated for March 21.The ban also applied to Abbott Laboratories'  Phensedyl cough syrup and Abbott's Indian subsidiary also filed a writ petition at the same court, which will come up for hearing on Tuesday, local television channels said.Sanjay Jain, a lawyer representing the health ministry, wasn't immediately available to comment. Abbott's Phensedyl commands around a third of India's cough syrup market and makes up over 3 percent of the company's $1 billion in revenue in India.

103,"   By Zeba Siddiqui and Aditya Kalra | MUMBAI/NEW DELHI  MUMBAI/NEW DELHI An Indian court granted U.S. drugmaker Pfizer (PFE.N) (PFIZ.NS) an interim injunction on a ban on its popular cough syrup Corex, days after the government ordered it to be prohibited citing a potential risk to humans.India's health ministry banned the combination of chlorpheniramine maleate and codeine syrup, which Pfizer sells as the cough syrup Corex, in a notice over the weekend.Pfizer's Indian subsidiary appealed the ban through a writ petition in the New Delhi High Court, which granted the company a stay on Monday, pending the next court hearing, Pfizer said in a statement.Pfizer's Indian business said earlier on Monday it had stopped selling Corex, and expected its profit to be hit, as the brand generated sales of about $26 million in the nine months through December. Pfizer shares closed down 9 percent in Mumbai, before the stay order was issued.The court said the government had not issued Pfizer a ""show cause notice"" before banning the medicine, two lawyers for the drugmaker told Reuters, declining to be named.The next hearing by on Pfizer's plea is slated for March 21.The ban also applied to Abbott Laboratories' (ABT.N) Phensedyl cough syrup and Abbott's Indian subsidiary also filed a writ petition at the same court, which will come up for hearing on Tuesday, local television channels said. Sanjay Jain, a lawyer representing the health ministry, wasn't immediately available to comment.

105,"   By Zeba Siddiqui and Aditya Kalra | MUMBAI  MUMBAI A powerful antibiotic combination that is marketed in India by U.S. pharmaceutical giant Abbott Laboratories is among 344 drug combinations that have been banned by the Indian health authorities.A Reuters investigation revealed in December that a unit of Abbott in India was selling a combination of the antibiotics cefixime and azithromycin without approval from the central government. The combination is not approved for sale in major pharmaceutical markets, including the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, France and Japan. (For the full investigation: reut.rs/1J9azFo)Abbott markets the combination of cefixime and azithromycin under the Zimnic AZ brand. At least 15 other companies in India manufacture and market the same combination under different brand names.A notice issued by the Indian Health Ministry at the weekend said that a government-appointed committee of experts had found that the banned combinations were “likely to involve risk to human beings, whereas safer alternatives to the said drug are available.”The government notice said the ban would take effect immediately. Besides antibiotic combinations, the list of banned drugs also included analgesic combinations containing nimesulide, and codeine-based drugs.Anand Kadkol, a spokesman for Abbott in India, said the government announcement had been made late on Saturday and the company was “reviewing the notification.” Fixed-dose combination drugs, or FDCs, combine two or more drugs in a single pill. In India, many pharmaceutical companies have obtained a license from a state to make FDCs, like Abbott’s Zimnic AZ, and sell them across the country without the consent of the central government.India’s drug regulators have made intermittent efforts over the years to shut down this avenue, but enforcement has been patchy and success limited. In 2007, for instance, the government instructed states to withdraw close to 300 combination drugs that were being sold without the approval of the central government. But drug companies and industry associations took the government to court and the order was stayed.D.G. Shah, the secretary general of the Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance, which represents 20 of India’s biggest drugmakers, questioned the legality of the government’s decision and said “the lack of transparency raises doubts about the merits and the process followed or not followed.” Shah said companies that were affected by the ban could challenge the order in court.K.L. Sharma, a senior Health Ministry official who issued the ban order, was not immediately available for comment.In its notice, the government said a panel of experts had found that there was “no therapeutic justification” for any of the 344 FDCs it was banning. The panel reviewed 6,700 drug combinations. In its investigation, Reuters interviewed former and current medical representatives for Abbott who said Zimnic AZ had been promoted and administered as a treatment for a broad array of illnesses, including colds, fevers, urinary tract infections, drug-resistant typhoid and sexually transmitted diseases. Reuters also found chemists who were selling the drug to prevent post-operative infection and for respiratory problems.Medical experts told Reuters that combining cefixime and azithromycin was risky, and said that prescribing the combination for cold symptoms did not make sense.While combination drugs are used worldwide to improve patients' compliance, in India they have proliferated to the point where in 2014 nearly half the drugs on the market were combinations. Companies in India have increasingly added ingredients to existing drugs so they can promote a new product to doctors and chemists in an effort to increase market share.Doctors and health experts say the spread and misuse of antibiotic combinations may be contributing to antibiotic resistance in India. Some superbugs, which are strains of bacteria that have become resistant to antibiotics, have been found in patients who travelled from India to countries including the United States and Britain.

115,"   By Caroline Humer and Bill Berkrot  Abbott Laboratories (ABT.N) said on Thursday that it would buy St. Jude Medical Inc (STJ.N) in a $25 billion deal to expand its heart device business, but investors worried that the acquisition would not pay off as promised.Medical equipment makers are under pressure to offer a wider portfolio of products to hospital customers, which have also been through a wave of mergers that have increased their power to negotiate on pricing.Abbott said its deal would help it compete more effectively against larger rivals Medtronic Plc (MDT.N) and Boston Scientific Corp (BSX.N), but its shares fell nearly 6 percent. Abbott Chief Executive Officer Miles White defended the deal on a conference call with analysts, saying it would add to earnings per share in the first full year after it closes. The company said St. Jude's devices to treat heart failure and abnormal heart rhythm complement its own cardiovascular products. White also said on CNBC that while St. Jude has had low-growth years, it has new products to introduce over the next few years.""St. Jude is in more mature cardiac rhythm management markets, so does this really become additive to the overall Abbott revenue growth rate?” BMO Capital Markets analyst Joanne Wuensch said. Abbott is also trying to buy diagnostics company Alere Inc (ALR.N) for $5.8 billion and has a plan in place to borrow money for both it and St. Jude. Still, some investors have doubts it will complete the Alere deal because the U.S. government is investigating that company over sales practices. “Abbott as serial acquirer has built up its medical device division,"" Morningstar analyst Debbie Wang said. ""Once they make those purchases, it does not seem like management is very good at producing meaningful innovation.”   With St. Jude, Abbott could compete better in an environment where hospitals prefer to deal with only two or three vendors, White said. ""Price pressure has been a way of life for a couple of years, so you have to make it up on volume,"" said Gabelli Funds portfolio manager Jeff Jonas, adding that there is ""really no overlap"" in the companies' products.Abbott, which also sells nutritionals such as baby formula, generic pharmaceuticals and diagnostics, said the combined cardiovascular device unit would have annual sales of $8.7 billion.Shares of St. Jude were up 27.3 percent at $78.10 in midday trading, while Abbott was down 5.6 percent after a sharper drop. CASH AND STOCK St. Jude shareholders will receive $46.75 in cash and 0.8708 of an Abbott share for each of their shares. Based on Abbott's closing stock price on Wednesday, the deal is worth $25 billion, or about $85 per share, a 37 percent premium.The acquisition will add 21 cents per share to earnings, excluding special items, in 2017 and 29 cents in 2018, Abbott said. Abbott said it would take on or refinance about $5.7 billion of St. Jude's net debt. It sees $500 million in cost savings by 2020.The move comes after years of speculation about the two medical device companies merging. Bloomberg reported last summer that a deal was under discussion, but Abbott denied it.Responding to analysts' questions on Thursday, White said the talks did not begin until late last year.""I don't know that anything has changed,"" White said. ""I've been open about being interested in M&A.""Evercore and Bank of America Merrill Lynch are advising Abbott on the St. Jude deal, while Guggenheim Securities is the financial adviser to St. Jude.Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz was legal counsel to Abbott, while Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher advised St. Jude.

116,"   By Michelle Sierra | NEW YORK  NEW YORK A US$17.2bn bridge loan that backs Abbott Laboratories’ US$25bn acquisition of medical device maker St. Jude Medical will boost investment grade loan volume that so far this year has been depressed by volatility in equities and global economic uncertainty.The Bank of America Merrill Lynch-led transaction will hike merger and acquisition-related volume of investment grade deals after issuance dropped to US$28.5bn in the first quarter from US$46.6bn in the fourth quarter of 2015 and US$71.6bn in the third quarter of last year.Abbott’s new loan will bring bridge loan volume to US$24.5bn early in the second quarter of 2016, surpassing the US$15.3bn seen last quarter.Freeman Consulting Services estimate the fees for the US$17.2bn bridge to be between US$50m to US$75m.“If this is a catalyst to jumpstart the market, that’d be great,” a banker said.Abbott will assume or refinance St. Jude's net debt, which is currently US$5.7bn.STILL I-GRADE Abbott is still in the process of completing the US$8.5bn acquisition of Alere Inc, provider of health information through diagnostic tests, announced in February.The significant debt component would bring leverage to 5.0 times, according to an Intraday comment issued by Carol Levenson, director of research at Gimme Credit. Leverage was about 2.0 times before either of the two pending acquisitions as of the last published balance sheet in December, Levenson said in a follow-up email.  An Abbott conference call transcript Thursday morning indicated the company remains committed to maintaining an investment grade credit rating by deleveraging the combined entity.“Abbott appears to have brokered the financing structure with the rating agencies to preserve investment grade ratings,” Levenson said in the note. “The consideration is balanced between cash and equity, with a strong 45% equity component.” In order to further rebalance its capital structure, Abbott also expects to issue US$3bn of common stock, according to the transcript. “Although modestly dilutive to Abbott's adjusted earnings per share, this issuance provides important financial flexibility and liquidity to achieve our broader business objectives,” said Brian Yoor, Abbott’s senior vice president and chief investment officer, on the call.Standard & Poor’s Ratings Service said in a note Thursday it kept Abbott Laboratories’ A+ rating on CreditWatch with negative implications where it placed it in February following the Alere acquisition announcement.M&A UPSWING  The St. Jude acquisition announcement raised questions among analysts listening to the call on how Abbott’s pending US$8.5bn purchase of Alere fits into the picture. Abbott financed the Alere transaction with a US$9bn bridge loan that closed in February. Moody’s Investors Service placed Abbott 's A2 senior unsecured on review for downgrade following the Alere combination news in February.“There is no relationship between Alere and St. Jude here in any of this,” said Miles White, Abbott’s chairman and chief operating officer, on the call. “These are completely independent events. And yet the company can finance both and remain investment grade, we are quite confident.”“Alere still seems to be ‘on’ for the moment, as management said the financing it has lined up is sufficient for both deals,” said Levenson in her intraday comment.As per the terms of the acquisition announced Thursday, St. Jude shareholders will receive US$46.75 in cash and 0.8708 Abbott shares, representing a total consideration of about US$85 per share. The offer represents a 37% premium to St. Jude's Wednesday closing. St. Jude's shares were trading up more than 27% from Wednesday, at US$78.44 late Thursday. The deal will add to Abbott's adjusted earnings per share in the first full year after the close of the transaction, the company said. It will add 21 cents per share in 2017 and 29 cents in 2018.Abbott's cardiovascular device unit will have annual sales of US$8.7bn after the businesses are combined.Bank of America Merrill Lynch declined to comment. Abbott did not provide comment beyond the press release.St. Jude and Alere were not immediately available for comment.

117,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, April 28 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has maintained Abbott Laboratories'  (ABT, Abbott) 'A'/'F1' ratings on Rating Watch Negative. The rating action  follows the announcement of Abbott's intention to acquire St. Jude Medical Inc.  (STJ, St. Jude) and its previously announced agreement from February 2016 to  acquire Alere Inc. (Alere). Fitch will resolve the Rating Watch as more details regarding the transactions  become available. However, given the currently available information and  assuming Abbott acquires both Alere and St. Jude, Fitch will likely downgrade  Abbott to 'BBB'/'F2'. Abbott had approximately $9 billion in outstanding debt at Dec. 31, 2015. A full  list of rating actions follows at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS --St. Jude and Alere are good strategic fits, but the acquisitions will  significantly stress leverage for at least two years. --Abbott's diversified product portfolio is positioned to deliver  mid-single-digit organic growth with or without the additions of St. Jude and  Alere. --Fitch anticipates that Abbott's efforts to improve operating margins will  continue to yield results through organic improvements in sales mix and cost  control plus integration-related synergies. --Fitch forecasts Abbott generating positive free cash flow (FCF) excluding the  near-term negative effect of one-time acquisition/integration related costs.  --Fitch expects the company's Nutrition, Diagnostics and Established  Pharmaceuticals segments to benefit from the growth in emerging markets.  --Abbott's ongoing focus on new product introductions across virtually all of  its business segments bodes well for growth and margins. --The company faces challenges regarding reimbursement for some of its products,  as well as near-term adverse foreign exchange movements and select international  economic stress. --Fitch expects that Abbott will maintain adequate liquidity through cash  generation, bank credit and access to the capital markets. Sound Acquisitions/High Leverage: Abbott's planned acquisitions of St. Jude and  Alere are good strategic fits. Both expand Abbott's market presence in segments  that the company currently operates, by providing the company with broader  product offerings. The acquired portfolios, in aggregate, will also offer  organic growth potential. Abbott should be able to realize the combined  forecasted pre-tax synergies (from St. Jude and Alere) of roughly $800 million  within four years of the acquisitions. The equity value of the St. Jude  transaction is approximately $25 billion ($46.75 in cash and 0.8708 shares of  Abbott common stock per share of St. Jude) plus roughly $5.7 billion assumed net  debt. Abbott intends to acquire Alere for $5.8 billion cash (equity value) and  around $2.6 billion of assumed net debt.  The two acquisitions will significantly increase debt, with leverage forecasted  to remain above 3.0x through 2019. Fitch expects Abbott will reduce leverage to  durably below 3.0x thereafter, through a combination of debt reduction and  increased EBITDA. Operating margins will likely improve because of favorable  shifts in sales mix, good cost control and synergies. FCF should stay  significantly positive (excluding one-time restructuring costs). The potential  BBB'/'F2' post-transaction rating assumes Abbott will pursue a more conservative  approach to capital deployment, with share repurchases, dividend increases and  acquisitions remaining modest. The transaction is likely to close near year-end 2016 pending regulatory  approvals and St. Jude shareholder approval. The addition of St. Jude's products  will significantly expand Abbott's medical device portfolio, particularly in the  area of cardiovascular disease. The deal will position Abbott as the number-one  or number-two player in many of the sub-segments of the cardiovascular device  market. The combination provides minimal overlap in product categories and  offers Abbott a larger presence in the faster growing device areas of atrial  fibrillation, structural heart and neuromodulation. Abbott estimates that it will realize roughly $500 million in annual synergies  by 2020 from the St. Jude acquisition. Broader portfolios within the  sub-segments of cardiovascular should provide Abbott with increased  contracting/shelf space opportunities when contracting with hospital management  and purchasing groups. Cost-related synergies in the areas of sourcing plus some  overlap in sales force and administrative functions should be attainable. In  addition, Abbott has a demonstrable record of accomplishment of acquiring and  successfully integrating acquisitions. Alere Expands Point-of-Care Diagnostics: Fitch believes the acquisition of Alere  makes sense strategically, as the combination will increase Abbott's presence in  point-of-care diagnostics and prospects to expand Alere's products into  international markets. Abbott already has a strong position in the medical  diagnostics market. The point-of-care segment of the diagnostics market will  likely grow faster than the in vitro diagnostic market during the intermediate  term. The company also expects to achieve nearly $300 million in pre-tax  synergies by 2019 and more thereafter. Durable Margin Improvement: Abbott will likely focus on improving margins  through cost control and generating a favorable shift in sales mix. In addition  to securing the forecasted acquisition-related synergies, Fitch looks for Abbott  to continue driving efficiencies across its business segments. Innovative,  value-added product launches should be able to secure attractive pricing. Fitch  expects margin improvements will be durable during the intermediate term. Stable Operations Prior/Post Acquisition: Fitch forecasts that Abbott's  diversified product portfolio (with or without the two acquisitions) will  continue to produce mid-single-digit organic growth in the intermediate term,  given the strength of its product offerings and its geographic mix. However,  adverse foreign exchange movements will likely hamper reported growth in the  near term, although margins should remain moderately insulated from the trend.  Revenue growth and margin support should provide for solid free cash flow  generation. Positive FCF/Conservative Capital Deployment: Fitch estimates that Abbott will  generate normalized free cash flow in 2018 and 2019 of roughly $1.5 billion to  $1.6 billion, with one-time transaction-related costs hampering FCF before then.  Forecasted revenue growth and moderately improving margins will drive cash  generation. Capital expenditures and dividends incrementally increase during the  forecast period, as the company focuses on strengthening its balance sheet and  credit profile. FCF should be sufficient to fund debt reduction, modest share  repurchases and small acquisitions. Select Market Headwinds: Abbott faces a few challenges in select geographic  markets, including restrictive reimbursement rates for diabetic supplies and  infant nutritionals in the U.S. Unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements and  economic stress in Venezuela will likely hamper reported top-line growth.  However, foreign exchange affects margins less than reported revenues because  the company has significant operations (costs) in some geographies that are  experiencing currency devaluation. Emerging Markets Supporting Growth: Fitch expects a significant portion of  Abbott's growth will come from emerging markets, fueled by favorable  demographics, economic growth. Nutrition, Diagnostics and Established  Pharmaceuticals, in particular, should benefit from the rapidly growing middle  class in these markets. Consumer out-of-pocket purchases account for a large  portion of revenues in these markets. This contrasts to developed markets, where  the vast majority of purchases involve third-party payers. As such, rising  disposable income is an important driver of demand in these markets New Product Flow: Abbott continues to refresh its product portfolio across all  of its business segments, helping to drive growth through market expansion  and/or market penetration. Newer products with improved efficacy and safety  profiles often garner value-added prices, offering support for margins. Many of  the company's launches are tailored to specific geographies. Fitch expects the  potential addition of Alere's and St. Jude's pipelines will further support  innovative product introductions over the long term. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case for Abbott Laboratories  (excluding the St. Jude acquisition) include:  --Leverage to increase significantly in the near to intermediate term, if the  Alere acquisition is completed. --Mid single-digit organic revenue growth with organic growth offset by negative  foreign exchange rate effects.  --Incrementally improving margins, particularly in Nutritional Products and  Diagnostics, given Abbott's efforts to improve efficiencies in these two  segments. --Modest annual FCF (cash flow from operations minus capital expenditures minus  dividends) during 2016 but significantly improving throughout the forecast  period. --Continued share repurchases and dividend increases. RATING SENSITIVITIES Fitch will resolve the Rating Watch once more details regarding the transaction  are available. However, given the currently available information and assuming  Abbott acquires both Alere and St. Jude, Fitch expects that Abbott's ratings  would likely move to 'BBB'/'F2'. The following rating sensitivities exclude the potential acquisition of St.  Jude:  --Leverage to increase significantly in the near to intermediate term, if the  Alere acquisition is completed. --Mid-single digit organic revenue growth with organic growth offset by negative  foreign exchange rate effects.  --Incrementally improving margins in Nutritional Products and Diagnostics as  well other areas within the firm.  --Continued share repurchases and dividend increases. LIQUIDITY Adequate Liquidity: Fitch expects Abbott to maintain adequate liquidity, as it  will term out all of its and STJ's short-Term borrowings ($3.5 - $4 billion) and  ultimately end up with full availability on its $5 billion revolving credit  facility that expires in July 2019 and availability on its CP program.  Independent of the St. Jude acquisition, Abbott also plans to issue $3 billion  of its common stock in the secondary market to provide further flexibility. Manageable Debt Maturities: At Dec. 31, 2015, Abbott had approximately $9  billion in debt outstanding (including $3.1 billion in short-term borrowings).  Fitch believes the company's debt maturities are manageable, with no significant  maturities until 2019.

118,"  (Adds expected bank fees, updates throughout.)By Michelle SierraNEW YORK, April 28 A US$17.2bn bridge loan that backs Abbott Laboratories' US$25bn acquisition of medical device maker St. Jude Medical will boost investment grade loan volume that so far this year has been depressed by volatility in equities and global economic uncertainty.The Bank of America Merrill Lynch-led transaction will hike merger and acquisition-related volume of investment grade deals after issuance dropped to US$28.5bn in the first quarter from US$46.6bn in the fourth quarter of 2015 and US$71.6bn in the third quarter of last year.Abbott's new loan will bring bridge loan volume to US$24.5bn early in the second quarter of 2016, surpassing the US$15.3bn seen last quarter.Freeman Consulting Services estimate the fees for the US$17.2bn bridge to be between US$50m to US$75m.""If this is a catalyst to jumpstart the market, that'd be great,"" a banker said.Abbott will assume or refinance St. Jude's net debt, which is currently US$5.7bn.STILL I-GRADE Abbott is still in the process of completing the US$8.5bn acquisition of Alere Inc, provider of health information through diagnostic tests, announced in February.

127,"   By Susan Kelly  U.S. health regulators said on Tuesday they approved a stent by Abbott Laboratories that is the first designed to be absorbed into the bloodstream after it is implanted.The stent, called Absorb, is made of a plastic similar to dissolving sutures and offers patients an alternative to metal stents currently used to prop open arteries cleared of blockages.Unlike traditional stents that remain in place after implantation, Absorb is designed to disappear fully within three years of the procedure.Absorb’s appeal is that it allows the blood vessel to return to a natural state, free from a permanent metal implant. The approach holds particular promise for patients whose coronary artery disease could require multiple implants over the course of several decades, said Mitchell Krucoff, a professor at Duke University Medical Center who has advised Abbott on Absorb. ""This is a game changer,"" he said in an interview. ""There are no longer going to be permanent metal implants in the artery.""Absorb releases the drug everolimus to combat the growth of scar tissue that can form within a stent and cause the artery to narrow again, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which approved the stent, said. ""No metal means the treated artery can pulse and flex naturally as demands on the heart change with everyday activities,"" said Gregg Stone of Columbia University Medical Center, who led clinical trials for Absorb. ""No metal may also reduce the potential of future blockages that occur with permanent metallic stents.""Data released in October concluded Absorb was comparable to Abbott’s own Xience drug-coated metal stent in safety and effectiveness but showed a higher risk of heart attacks and blood clots. Abbott said it expects the risks to lessen as surgeons gain experience with it.     Absorb also will compete with Medtronic Plc's traditional drug-coated Resolute stent and Boston Scientific Corp's Synergy and Promus stents. Synergy’s polymer coating disappears over time after delivering a drug that helps prevent the artery from re-clogging, leaving a metal stent in place.    Abbott plans to roll out the device to about 100 hospitals in the next several months as it trains surgeons on the implant procedure before ramping up sales, said spokesman Jonathon Hamilton. Absorb will be priced at a ""modest"" premium to Xience, he said.    Analysts have predicted Absorb will gain a market niche but not surpass drug-dispensing metal stents such as Xience in share until longer-term data show more favorable clinical results.

132,"   By Amrutha Penumudi  Abbott Laboratories reported better-than-expected quarterly sales and profit as strong sales in its medical device business more than made up for the hit from an economic turmoil in Venezuela.Abbott is one of the major U.S. companies to be affected by troubled operations in Venezuela.The Latin American nation's economy contracted by 4.5 percent in the first nine months of last year as plunging oil prices, and what critics of President Nicolas Maduro see as policy missteps, took an increasing toll.Venezuela's official annual inflation rate was the world's highest at 141.5 percent in the nine months.Abbott, which rakes in two-thirds of its revenue from outside the United States, said emerging market sales increased 1.1 percent but would have risen 4.8 percent excluding the impact of Venezuelan operations.The company's results, however, beat Wall Street estimates, largely helped by its booming medical device business, where sales rose 6.4 percent to $1.37 billion in the second quarter.

Defensive sectors such as utilities and telecom have led the market's gains in 2016, while groups such as financials and tech have trailed.""It seems like the weaker parts of the market are starting to at least try and keep pace with the stronger parts and there really hasn't been a big selloff in the big winners to this point,"" said Rick Meckler, president of LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey.The Dow Jones industrial average rose 45.09 points, or 0.24 percent, to 18,604.1, putting it on pace for its ninth straight day of gains.The S&P 500 gained 10.27 points, or 0.47 percent, to 2,174.05 and the Nasdaq Composite added 56.85 points, or 1.13 percent, to 5,093.22.

134,"   By Amrutha Penumudi  Abbott Laboratories reported better-than-expected quarterly sales and profit as strong sales in its medical device business more than made up for the hit from an economic turmoil in Venezuela.Abbott is one of the major U.S. companies to be affected by troubled operations in Venezuela.The Latin American nation's economy contracted by 4.5 percent in the first nine months of last year as plunging oil prices, and what critics of President Nicolas Maduro see as policy missteps, took an increasing toll.Venezuela's official annual inflation rate was the world's highest at 141.5 percent in the nine months.Abbott, which rakes in two-thirds of its revenue from outside the United States, said emerging market sales increased 1.1 percent but would have risen 4.8 percent excluding the impact of Venezuelan operations.The company's results, however, beat Wall Street estimates, largely helped by its booming medical device business, where sales rose 6.4 percent to $1.37 billion in the second quarter.

137,"   By Jim Finkle and Dan Burns  The stock of pacemaker manufacturer St. Jude Medical Inc (STJ.N) fell sharply on Thursday after short-selling firm Muddy Waters said it had placed a bet that the shares would fall, claiming its implanted heart devices were vulnerable to cyber attacks.St. Jude, which agreed in April to sell itself for $25 billion to Abbott Laboratories (ABT.N), said the allegations were false. St Jude shares closed down 4.96 percent, the biggest one-day fall in 7 months and at a 7.4 percent discount to Abbott's takeover offer.Muddy Waters head Carson Block said the firm's position was motivated by research from a cyber security firm, MedSec Holdings Inc, which has a financial arrangement with Muddy Waters. MedSec asserted that St. Jude's heart devices were vulnerable to cyber attack and were a risk to patients.A MedSec report warned of two primary hacks on St. Jude pacemakers and defribillators: One that could cause implanted devices to pace at potentially dangerous rates and one that drains their batteries.MedSec approached Muddy Waters about three months ago and the two struck a deal under which Block agreed to hire MedSec as a consultant, pay it a licensing fee for research and a percentage of any profits from the investment, Block told Reuters. Reuters was not able to confirm the allegations by Block and MedSec, a firm founded 18 months ago focusing on cyber vulnerabilities in the healthcare industry. The allegations were detailed in a report published on the Muddy Waters website. The Department of Homeland Security and the Food and Drug Administration, which work together to investigate and remediate life-threatening cyber vulnerabilities in medical equipment, declined comment on St. Jude.Josh Corman, co-founder of I am the Cavalry, a group that has worked to establish standard procedures for privately disclosing vulnerabilities to manufacturers, said he was surprised St. Jude had been singled out. He said he was aware of other non-public research showing other device makers have cyber vulnerabilities. ""They may have a basis for singling out this one company, but it feels arbitrary and capricious. It doesn't ring true,"" said Corman. UNPRECEDENTED APPROACH Cyber security experts said that it was unprecedented for a cyber security researcher to go public with research about cyber bugs as part of a short-selling strategy. Researchers typically disclose bugs by approaching affected firms, working through intermediaries who communicate on their behalf, or presenting them at peer-reviewed cyber conferences.MedSec Chief Executive Justine Bone told Reuters that her firm decided to not adhere to those practices.  ""We have expenses we incur. This is a business relationship,"" she told Reuters. ""But our goal here is to bring this to the attention of the public.""MedSec's report said ""low-level"" hackers could exploit security vulnerabilities in devices that St. Jude uses to enable doctors to remotely access data on their patients' implanted pacemakers and defibrillators, which use electricity to stabilize.St. Jude Chief Technology Officer Philip Ebeling said there were several layers of security in place for its devices.""We conduct security assessments on an ongoing basis and work with external experts specifically on Merlin@home and on all our devices,"" Ebeling said in a statement. Block also said he has taken a ""long"" position in Abbott, a bet that its stock will rise. A representative for Abbott had no comment.Abbott dropped 0.76 percent to close around a one-month low of $42.84. At that price, Abbott's takeover offer for St. Jude was valued at $84.06 a share.Were St. Jude’s fortunes to deteriorate significantly, Abbott could seek to cite a material-adverse-effect clause built into most acquisition contracts to back out of its merger agreement. Abbott would not be required to pay a termination fee.In practice, such moves are rare, because the legal threshold is high for showing an adverse impact on business. Abbott is already seeking to pull out of one deal this year. The company offered Alere up to $50 million to terminate its $5.8 billion acquisition after the medical testing device maker was hit by accounting issues. Alere, however, has so far resisted efforts by Abbott to end that deal.  Block, who announced his firm's position on Twitter, told Reuters that his firm felt that MedSec was correct to single out St. Jude because ""none of their competitors are anywhere close to this bad."" He said that one of his firm's researchers had replicated some of MedSec's findings.Researchers tested second-hand Merlin@home devices obtained on eBay, among the hundreds of thousands that are in use, the report said. It said St. Jude pushed out a software update to some Merlin@home devices but that it ""represented a very slight change in security."" (Reporting by Jim Finkle in Toronto and Dan Burns in New York.

""But there are a few paths that could lead to problems.""     Abbott could decide to back out of the St. Jude deal or push for a lower valuation ""if they were to conclude remediation steps must be taken with St. Jude's technology,"" Jason Mills, an analyst at Canaccord Genuity, said in a note.      One concern being voiced is that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration could demand a full-scale product recall, which in turn could trigger a ""material adverse change"" clause in St. Jude's merger agreement.That would give Abbott the ability to walk away from the deal, according to investors and analysts interviewed by Reuters.    If the deal were called off due to an adverse event, St. Jude would probably fall below the approximately $60 per share that it was trading at before the Abbott deal was announced, investors said. A forced recall, though, is unlikely, according to Mills.

146,"   By Carl O'Donnell  Alere Inc (ALR.N) alleges Abbott Laboratories (ABT.N) is trying to stymie its planned $5.8 billion takeover of the diagnostics company by purposefully delaying key submissions to anti-trust regulators, according to a lawsuit made public on Tuesday.Alere claims in its complaint that Abbott has avoided responding to a second request by the Federal Trade Commission in a bout of ""buyer's remorse"" spurred by a desire to free up capital for Abbott's other major planned deal - a $24 billion acquisition of rival St. Jude Medical (STJ.N).Abbott denied the allegations, arguing that Alere's financial problems and related delays in filing its financial statements had slowed the deal's progress. Abbott also said it had been approached by a whistleblower who alleges that Alere is deliberately hiding information about its Indian operations.""Alere’s complaint is nonsense and without merit,"" Abbott said in a statement. ""Their description of events is fiction and nothing but a publicity stunt. Abbott is compliant with its obligations under the merger agreement."" Alere's planned deal with Abbott ran into trouble when it revealed that it was under investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice for some of its foreign sales practices and that it would not be able to provide certain key regulatory filings on time.Prior to the deal, Alere already had revealed that its accounting practices had been under scrutiny by the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Abbott agreed to acquire Alere in February. In late April, Abbott struck an even bigger deal to buy St. Jude to position itself as the dominant player in the market for cardiovascular devices. After the second deal was announced, Alere said in a filing that it had declined an offer from Abbott to pay it up to $50 million to break off their merger agreement.

167,"  Abbott Laboratories, which is in the process of buying St. Jude Medical Inc for $25 billion, said the companies would sell some of their medical devices to Japan-based Terumo Corp for about $1.12 billion.Abbott said on Tuesday the deal is an important step toward completion of the St. Jude acquisition, which is scheduled to close by the year-end.The deal is subject to the successful completion of Abbott's acquisition of St. Jude and other approvals.The divestiture was a nice win for the companies as it signaled that the deal remained on track to close before the year-end and the price seems ""extremely lucrative"", Canaccord Genuity analysts wrote in a client note. St. Jude's shares rose 1.93 percent, their biggest intraday percentage jump since the deal with Abbott was announced in April, to $79.16. Abbott's shares gained about 1 percent to $40.96.     St. Jude has been under pressure after short-seller Muddy Waters and research firm MedSec Holdings alleged in August that the company's heart devices were riddled with defects that make them vulnerable to cyber hacks. St. Jude has denied the allegations and sued both companies.The company said last week it would recall some of its 400,000 implanted heart devices due to risk of premature battery depletion, a condition linked to two deaths in Europe. The all-cash transaction will include St. Jude Medical's Angio-Seal and Femoseal vascular closure products and Abbott's Vado Steerable Sheath, the companies said on Tuesday. Abbott said it would retain its vascular closure products.

187,"   By Foo Yun Chee  EU antitrust regulators are expected to give conditional clearance to U.S. medical device maker Abbott Laboratories' (ABT.N) $25 billion bid for rival St. Jude Medical Inc (STJ.N), a person familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.A spokesman for the European Commission, which is due to decide on the deal by Nov. 23, declined to comment. Abbott, which also makes prescription drugs and diagnostics, had no immediate comment. St. Jude officials could not be reached for comment.Abbott Chief Executive Miles White in October said he hoped to acquire St. Jude by the end of the year, despite lingering questions about the safety of its implantable heart devices.The suburban Chicago company announced the St. Jude deal in April to expand its heart device business and help it compete against larger rivals Medtronic Plc (MDT.N) and Boston Scientific Corp (BSX.N).The companies offered concessions to address the European Commission's concerns on Oct. 31 but did not disclose details.  However, two weeks before that, they announced the sale of some of their medical devices worth about $1.12 billion to Japanese company Terumo Corp (4543.T), saying the move was part of their deal.The all-cash transaction included St. Jude Medical's Angio-Seal and Femoseal vascular closure products and Abbott's Vado Steerable Sheath.St. Jude is facing multiple problems, including an investigation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration over claims its heart devices have defects that make them vulnerable to fatal cyber hacks. The company sued short-seller Muddy Waters and its investment partner, cyber research firm MedSec Holdings, after they claimed flaws in the cyber security of its devices. MedSec warned the alleged flaws could cause implanted devices to pace at potentially dangerous rates or have their batteries drained.After Abbott reported stronger than expected earnings on Oct. 19, White praised the way St. Jude has handled Muddy Waters' allegations. In an unrelated matter last month, St. Jude said it will recall some of its 400,000 implanted heart devices due to the risk of premature battery depletion, a condition linked to two deaths in Europe.Shares of Abbott and St. Jude both closed 1.6 percent higher on Tuesday amid moderate gains for the broad stock market.Mergers in the sector have underscored the pressure felt by medical equipment makers to scale up and offer a wider range of products to hospital customers.

189,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, November 18 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A(EXP)' rating with  a Negative Rating Watch to Abbott Laboratories' (ABT, Abbott) notes offering.  The net proceeds are expected to be used to fund the company's acquisition of  St. Jude Medical Inc. (STJ, St. Jude). Abbott is also in the process of  potentially acquiring Alere Inc. (Alere). Fitch will resolve the Rating Watch as more details regarding the transaction  become available. Fitch expects to downgrade Abbott to 'BBB'/'F2'. A full list of ratings follows the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS --St. Jude is a good strategic fit, but the acquisition will significantly  stress leverage for at least two years with or without the acquisition of Alere. --Abbott's diversified product portfolio is positioned to deliver  mid-single-digit organic growth with the acquisition(s) and on a standalone  basis. --Fitch anticipates that Abbott's efforts to improve operating margins will  continue to yield results through organic improvements in sales mix and cost  control plus integration-related synergies. --Fitch forecasts Abbott generating positive free cash flow (FCF) excluding the  near-term negative effect of one-time acquisition/integration related costs.  --Fitch expects the company's Nutrition, Diagnostics and Established  Pharmaceuticals segments to benefit from the growth in emerging markets.  --Abbott's ongoing focus on new product introductions across virtually all of  its business segments bodes well for growth and margins. --The company faces challenges regarding reimbursement for some of its products,  as well as near-term adverse foreign exchange movements and select international  economic stress. --Fitch expects that Abbott will maintain adequate liquidity through cash  generation, bank credit and access to the capital markets. Sound Acquisitions/High Leverage: Abbott's planned acquisitions of St. Jude and  Alere are good strategic fits. Both expand Abbott's market presence in segments  that the company currently operates, by providing the company with broader  product offerings. The acquired portfolios, in aggregate, will also offer  organic growth potential. Abbott should be able to realize the combined  forecasted pre-tax synergies (from St. Jude and Alere) of roughly $800 million  within four years of the acquisitions. The equity value of the St. Jude  transaction is approximately $25 billion ($46.75 in cash and 0.8708 shares of  Abbott common stock per share of St. Jude) plus roughly $5.7 billion assumed net  debt. Abbott intends to acquire Alere for $5.8 billion cash (equity value) and  around $2.6 billion of assumed net debt.  The two acquisitions will significantly increase debt, with leverage forecasted  to remain above 3.0x through 2019. Without the Alere acquisition, forecasted  leverage would likely remain at or above 3.0x through 2018. Fitch expects Abbott  will reduce leverage to durably below 3.0x thereafter, through a combination of  debt reduction and increased EBITDA. Operating margins will likely improve  because of favorable shifts in sales mix, good cost control and synergies. FCF  should stay significantly positive (excluding one-time restructuring costs). The  potential BBB'/'F2' post-transaction rating assumes Abbott will pursue a more  conservative approach to capital deployment, with share repurchases, dividend  increases and acquisitions remaining modest. The transaction is likely to close near year-end 2016 pending regulatory  approvals. The addition of St. Jude's products will significantly expand  Abbott's medical device portfolio, particularly in the area of cardiovascular  disease. The deal will position Abbott as the number-one or number-two player in  many of the sub-segments of the cardiovascular device market. The combination  provides minimal overlap in product categories and offers Abbott a larger  presence in the faster growing device areas of atrial fibrillation, structural  heart and neuromodulation. Abbott estimates that it will realize roughly $500 million in annual synergies  by 2020 from the St. Jude acquisition. Broader portfolios within the  sub-segments of cardiovascular should provide Abbott with increased  contracting/shelf space opportunities when contracting with hospital management  and purchasing groups. Cost-related synergies in the areas of sourcing plus some  overlap in sales force and administrative functions should be attainable. In  addition, Abbott has a demonstrable record of accomplishment of acquiring and  successfully integrating acquisitions. Alere Expands Point-of-Care Diagnostics: Fitch believes the acquisition of Alere  makes sense strategically, as the combination will increase Abbott's presence in  point-of-care diagnostics and prospects to expand Alere's products into  international markets. Abbott already has a strong position in the medical  diagnostics market. The point-of-care segment of the diagnostics market will  likely grow faster than the in vitro diagnostic market during the intermediate  term. The company also expects to achieve nearly $300 million in pre-tax  synergies by 2019 and more thereafter. Durable Margin Improvement: Abbott will likely focus on improving margins  through cost control and generating a favorable shift in sales mix. In addition  to securing the forecasted acquisition-related synergies, Fitch looks for Abbott  to continue driving efficiencies across its business segments. Innovative,  value-added product launches should be able to secure attractive pricing. Fitch  expects margin improvements will be durable during the intermediate term. Stable Operations Prior/Post Acquisition: Fitch forecasts that Abbott's  diversified product portfolio (with or without the two acquisitions) will  continue to produce mid-single-digit organic growth in the intermediate term,  given the strength of its product offerings and its geographic mix. However,  adverse foreign exchange movements will likely hamper reported growth in the  near term, although margins should remain moderately insulated from the trend.  Revenue growth and margin support should provide for solid FCF generation. Positive FCF/Conservative Capital Deployment: Fitch estimates that Abbott will  generate normalized FCF in 2018 and 2019 of roughly $1.5 billion to $1.6  billion, with one-time transaction-related costs hampering FCF before then.  Forecasted revenue growth and moderately improving margins will drive cash  generation. Capital expenditures and dividends incrementally increase during the  forecast period, as the company focuses on strengthening its balance sheet and  credit profile. FCF should be sufficient to fund debt reduction, modest share  repurchases and small acquisitions. Select Market Headwinds: Abbott faces a few challenges in select geographic  markets, including restrictive reimbursement rates for diabetic supplies and  infant nutritionals in the U.S. Unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements and  economic stress in Venezuela will likely hamper reported top-line growth.  However, foreign exchange affects margins less than reported revenues because  the company has significant operations (costs) in some geographies that are  experiencing currency devaluation. Emerging Markets Supporting Growth: Fitch expects a significant portion of  Abbott's growth will come from emerging markets, fueled by favorable  demographics, economic growth. Nutrition, Diagnostics and Established  Pharmaceuticals, in particular, should benefit from the rapidly growing middle  class in these markets. Consumer out-of-pocket purchases account for a large  portion of revenues in these markets. This contrasts to developed markets, where  the vast majority of purchases involve third-party payers. As such, rising  disposable income is an important driver of demand in these markets. New Product Flow: Abbott continues to refresh its product portfolio across all  of its business segments, helping to drive growth through market expansion  and/or market penetration. Newer products with improved efficacy and safety  profiles often garner value-added prices, offering support for margins. Many of  the company's launches are tailored to specific geographies. Fitch expects the  potential addition of Alere's and St. Jude's pipelines will further support  innovative product introductions over the long term. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case for Abbott Laboratories  (excluding the St. Jude acquisition) include:  --Leverage to increase significantly in the near to intermediate term, if the  Alere acquisition is completed. --Mid single-digit organic revenue growth with organic growth offset by negative  foreign exchange rate effects.  --Incrementally improving margins, particularly in Nutritional Products and  Diagnostics, given Abbott's efforts to improve efficiencies in these two  segments. --Modest annual FCF (cash flow from operations minus capital expenditures minus  dividends) during 2016 but significantly improving throughout the forecast  period. --Continued share repurchases and dividend increases. RATING SENSITIVITIES Fitch will resolve the Rating Watch once more details regarding the transaction  are available. However, given the currently available information and assuming  Abbott acquires both Alere and St. Jude, Fitch expects that Abbott's ratings  would likely move to 'BBB'/'F2'. The following rating sensitivities exclude the potential acquisition of St.  Jude:  --Leverage to increase significantly in the near to intermediate term, if the  Alere acquisition is completed. --Mid-single digit organic revenue growth with organic growth offset by negative  foreign exchange rate effects.  --Incrementally improving margins in Nutritional Products and Diagnostics as  well other areas within the firm.  --Continued share repurchases and dividend increases. LIQUIDITY Adequate Liquidity: Fitch expects Abbott to maintain adequate liquidity, as it  will term out all of its and STJ's short-term borrowings ($3.5 billion- $4  billion) and ultimately end up with full availability on its $5 billion  revolving credit facility that expires in July 2019 and availability on its CP  program.  FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch maintains the following ratings on Negative Watch:  Abbott Laboratories  --Long-Term IDR 'A';  --Bank credit facility 'A'; --Senior unsecured debt 'A'; --Short-Term IDR 'F1'; --Commercial paper program 'F1'.
