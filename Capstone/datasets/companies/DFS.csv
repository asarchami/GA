9,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, January 13 (Fitch) Draft terms agreed to by the European Parliament  and the European Council in December that cap interchange fees on some European  debit and credit card transactions will likely have a manageable financial  impact on American Express (AmEx, 'A+') and Discover Financial Services  (Discover, 'BBB+'), Fitch Ratings says.  We expect that the effect will also be manageable but more felt at banks with  operations concentrated in the EU that issue payment cards on the Visa and  MasterCard networks. However, the interchange fee caps have been widely  anticipated, and we believe that issuers have had time to prepare for the impact  on revenue. Fitch believes increased regulation could have some unintended consequences. For  example, card members could face higher fees and/or reduced benefits as banks  re-assess these programs and seek to maintain appropriate profitability targets.  Fitch believes these could potentially take the form of annual membership fees,  account maintenance or other fees and/or more limited rewards. At the same time,  it remains unclear if merchants will be willing to pass through the savings to  consumers.  According to the European Commission, the new rules would introduce maximum fees  for consumer debit and credit cards and establish transparency rules for all  transactions, among other points. The agreement is in line with expectations  that interchange fees paid by merchants will become capped at 0.2% for debit  card transactions and 0.3% for credit card purchases. The primary targets of the  proposals are four-party payment networks (e.g. Visa and MasterCard), although  three-party payments systems that rely on bank issuers are also likely included  in the new rules. Three-party systems that rely on bank issuers would include  AmEx's Global Network Services (GNS) business and Discover's Diner's Club,  although neither is a material earnings contributor to their respective  franchises. The core proprietary card businesses of Amex and Discover (which do  not rely on bank issuers), are not included in the recent agreement, consistent  with the prior proposal. The agreement remains subject to final endorsement by EU member states and by  the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee, before being put to a vote by the  full Parliament, which is expected in early 2015, according to the European  Commission. The caps are expected to take effect six months after the  legislation enters into force.
