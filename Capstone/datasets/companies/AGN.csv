0,"   By Deena Beasley | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO A Texas judge has upheld U.S. patents covering Allergan Inc's Lumigan glaucoma drug through 2027, the company said in a regulatory filing on Tuesday, helping to send its shares up 6 percent.Separately on Tuesday, Allergan, which also makes wrinkle-fixing Botox, said it had been issued a new U.S. patent, expiring in 2024, covering its Restasis eye drops.The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas ruled in favor of Allergan in a patent infringement case filed against several drugmakers seeking to market generic versions of the 0.1 percent formulation of Lumigan.That formulation of the drug was introduced in 2010 to replace a stronger 0.3 percent solution that caused some patients to temporarily experience red eyes.""We believe with these two developments, the two biggest overhangs to the Allergan story will be removed,"" BMO Capital Markets analyst David Maris said in a research note. Allergan Chief Executive Officer David Pyott, in comments e at the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference, said the Texas court decision upholds Allergan's five Lumigan patents through 2027, but ""of course this will get appealed.""He added that Allergan can maintain exclusivity of the drug as long as one of the patents is ultimately upheld. Pyott said Allergan is unaware of whether any generic drugmakers have sought U.S. regulatory approval to sell copies of Restasis.Sales of Allergan's eye care pharmaceuticals totaled $2.12 billion in the first nine months of last year.Pyott said Allergan, which last year spent $1 billion to acquire MAP Pharmaceuticals and its Levadex experimental migraine drug, remains interested in acquiring new companies or products, particularly in areas like neurology and urologics, where it is not already a dominant player. ""In opthalmics and medical aesthetics, everyone already comes to us,"" he said.Allergan is not interested in adding slow-growth segments to its product mix, he said, adding that any deal ""would have to have the potential for double-digit growth.""Shares of Allergan, based in Irvine, California, rose $6.80, or 6 percent, to close at $121.22 on the New York Stock Exchange.(Reporting by Deena Beasley; Editing by Dan Grebler)",2014-01-14,AGN,"Tue Jan 14, 2014 | 6:48pm EST","Court upholds Allergan Lumigan patents, shares rise 6 percent",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-allergan-patents-idUSBREA0D1MN20140114?type=companyNews

2,"   By Lawrence Hurley | WASHINGTON, March 31  WASHINGTON, March 31 The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday left intact an appeals court ruling that endorsed patent protections for Combigan, Allergan Inc's glaucoma drug. The high court declined to hear an appeal filed by Novartis AG's Sandoz Inc, which had challenged several patents held by Allergan that do not expire until 2022. Sandoz wanted to sell a generic version of the drug, which also is used to treat ocular hypertension. In May 2013, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit decision ruled in favor of Allergan. The case is Sandoz v. Allergan, U.S. Supreme Court, 13-889.

5,"   By Svea Herbst-Bayliss, Rod Nickel and Olivia Oran | BOSTON/NEW YORK  BOSTON/NEW YORK Activist investor William Ackman has acquired a nearly 10 percent stake in wrinkle-treatment maker Allergan Inc and is working with Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc to buy the company, sources said on Monday.Ackman's Pershing Square, a $13 billion hedge fund, spent roughly $4 billion on acquiring the stake, its biggest-ever investment which comes less than a year after the hedge fund took a stake in Air Products & Chemicals.Pershing Square began buying stakes in Allergan in February, according to a regulatory filing, with money it had freed up by trimming its stake in Beam and getting out of General Growth Properties, one of its biggest winners ever.Valeant, a Canadian pharmaceutical company known for skin care products and generic drugs, has been on a buying spree and most recently acquired Bausch & Lomb Holdings.It has been eager to make a bid for Irvine, California-based Allergan for over a year but has been turned away, a source familiar with the matter said.In the regulatory filing, Ackman said Valeant will pay with a combination of stock and cash and expects the cash component to total around $15 billion. Barclays and Royal Bank of Canada have said they are ready to help with financing.A Valeant spokesperson said that a merger with Allergan would create an ""unrivaled platform for growth and value creation,"" and said that the company would soon finalize its proposal and then announce it. The potential deal also seems to be finding favor with analysts. ""The deal also looks attractive because of a ""massive amount"" of potential operating synergies from the two companies' overlap and Valeant's lower tax rate in Canada, Morningstar analyst David Krempa said.A spokeswoman for Pershing Square declined to comment.Traditionally, activist investors like Ackman take a stake in a company and then wait for a catalyst like a takeover to push the share price higher. In this case, Pershing Square is working together with Valeant as a group, according to a regulatory filing, so that Valeant can then push ahead on a takeover.Hedge fund ValueAct, also known for pursuing activist strategies, sits on the Valeant board but has historically shied away from getting involved in hostile takeovers. Pershing Square does not shy away from controversy, having waged a very public battle against nutrition and weight loss company Herbalife with a $1 billion short bet unveiled in December 2012. This year, Pershing Square is delivering some of the hedge fund industry's best returns with a gain of roughly 10 percent through the middle of April, a Pershing Square investor said, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500 index is largely flat.If the companies were to unite, the deal would bring together two mid-sized pharmaceutical companies with expertise in skin care and eye care products.Allergan, which also has a lucrative portfolio of ophthalmic drugs to treat conditions such as glaucoma and dry eye, reported $6.3 billion in revenue last year and forecast 2014 revenue of $6.65 billion to $6.95 billion. Valeant, reported $5.8 billion in revenue last year.There may be some push back from Allergan's board however, Morningstar analyst Michael Waterhouse said, noting that Valeant's reputation of slashing research and development might make some uneasy.Also Waterhouse said one big downside of a takeover, might be the loss of Allergan's longtime CEO David Pyott, an avid dealmaker who built Botox into a blockbuster by continuously testing it for new uses.Investors liked the news and sent shares up on Monday, with Allergan rising 6 percent to close at $142 per share. Valeant climbed 3.24 percent to close trading at $126.01.But one Valeant shareholder thought the deal might be too pricey. Allergan shares closed on Monday up 28 percent so far in 2014, trading at all-time highs.""It's almost impossible to turn it into a high return investment if you pay that kind of price,"" said Glenn Greenberg, managing director of Brave Warrior Advisors, a Valeant shareholder.(Additional reporting by Bill Berkrot, Ransdell Pierson; Editing by David Gregorio and Jonathan Oatis)",2014-04-21,AGN,"Mon Apr 21, 2014 | 6:22pm EDT",Ackman working with Valeant to press for Allergan takeover,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-hedgefunds-ackman-idUSBREA3K17N20140421?type=companyNews

10,"   By Svea Herbst-Bayliss | NEW YORK  NEW YORK William Ackman's $47 billion joint bid with Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc to buy Botox maker Allergan Inc may become a model for future deals, rival fund managers said.The unsolicited bid, the plans for which were revealed late on Monday, was unusual for a so-called activist investor such as Ackman. Usually, large acquisitions are the realm of private equity investors and corporations, not activist shareholders.Ackman, who runs the $13 billion Pershing Square Capital Management hedge fund, typically first buys a stake in a company and then agitates for change, sometimes leading to a sale. By having a bidder lined up in Valeant, Ackman essentially skipped that step, speeding the deal up and making his returns more likely.He already has a massive paper profit on his 9.7 percent stake in Allergan, built over February and March. Allergan's shares rose more than 15 percent on Tuesday.At the Active-Passive Investor Summit, an industry conference in New York on Tuesday, fund managers and investors said they expected more activists and companies to explore this route, and it could help speed up the pace of merger and acquisition activity in the process.""This is absolutely something we will see more of,"" said James Mitarotonda, founder of activist hedge fund Barington Capital, speaking on the sidelines of the conference.Investors in Pershing Square funds said it also comes with built-in protections that would not be there in a normal activist investment. A deal could boost Allergan and Valeant shares. And even if it did not happen but Allergan convinced shareholders it can grow more effectively alone, Pershing Square would still see its investment grow.Although other activists have done such deals in the past, the Valeant-Ackman pairing was getting more attention because of its size and because of Ackman's involvement, fund managers said. Ackman is known for aggressive moves, a reputation cemented by a win against railroad Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd, where it added seven new members to the board in 2012 and almost tripled its investment.One lawyer who works for a rival hedge fund said previous deals with similar structures have been of smaller, ranging from $1 billion to $3 billion.To be sure, some fund managers and investors also said that in spite of the attention, it's not easy to pull off too many such deals.It requires an investor with plenty of available cash - the kind of money Ackman has - and it may not be a friction-free endeavor in the long run. The deal may also not always be beneficial to the acquirer, who would see the price rise as news of the potential deal gets out in the market. ""You need the right conditions for an investor and a corporate culture to take risks and identify value,"" said Bruce Goldfarb, chief executive officer at proxy solicitor Okapi Partners. Goldfarb said a good activist-company matchup might be hard to find.Erik Gordon, a professor of law and business at the University of Michigan, said the unusual partnership could also face challenges in the long run if their bid succeeds.""Valeant will push for strategies and capital allocations that create operating synergies and Ackman will push for financial moves that quickly increase the value of the company,"" Gordon said. ""The different pushes are likely to lead to conflicts.""SPURNED SUITOR  The joint bid came together after Valeant tried over the past year to talk with Allergan about a deal that would have would brought together the two mid-sized companies with expertise in skin-care and eye-care products, but was spurned, according to Jeffrey Ubben, chief executive of activist fund ValueAct Capital, which has a seat on Valeant's board.Ackman was introduced to Valeant CEO Michael Pearson by a mutual acquaintance.

13,"  * TSX closes up 62.29 points, or 0.43 percent, at 14,555.97     * Valeant soars after bid for Botox maker; CP Rail up on cheery outlook   (Adds fund manager comment, updates prices to close)     By Alastair Sharp     TORONTO, April 22 Canada's main stock index notched a solid gain on Tuesday, helped by a surge in Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc after it said it planned to buy Botox maker Allergan Inc and an upbeat outlook from Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd.     Valeant is not the only acquisition story bubbling in Canada, with major gold miner Barrick Gold Corp looking to snap up a smaller producer and its rival Goldcorp Inc  having just walked away from another deal.     ""There's nothing like acquisitions to get everybody's juices going,"" said John Ing, president of Maison Placements Canada. ""Barrick remains a big trader on speculation on whether they return to the bargaining table.""     Barrick gained 1.8 percent to C$19.37 in heavy trade as Goldman Sachs upgraded the stock to a ""buy"" from ""neutral"" and investors placed bets on whether it can pull off a bid for Newmont Mining Corp.     Sources told Reuters on Monday that talks had hit a snag but are likely to resume with both companies eager for a deal.       Valeant gained 7.7 percent to C$149.38 as investors cheered its latest acquisition plan, a partnership with activist investor Bill Ackman that could make Valeant a top five global pharmaceutical company.      ""Valeant is a growth story. There is a big chunk of the market that likes growth,"" said Michael Simpson, a senior portfolio manager at Sentry Select Capital Corp.       ""They like the fact that they're possibly teaming up with an activist investor who's got a decent track record, Bill Ackman, in their potential acquisition of Allergan.""     Shares in Canadian Pacific, the country's second largest railway, jumped 5.3 percent to C$172.62 after it reported strong first-quarter profit and said it could still meet its full-year targets despite one of the harshest winters in decades.       The largest railway, Canadian National Railway Co  reported solid numbers after the bell on Tuesday.       Overall, the Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P/TSX composite index ended the session up 62.29 points, or 0.43 percent, at 14,555.97. It hit a fresh near six-year high during the session.     Maison's Ing said the index's sharp rise puts it at risk of pullback as geopolitical and other risks continue to swirl.     ""There's a lot of headwinds. We're up in rarefied territory, the technical indicators are very much overbought,"" he said.     Rogers Communications Inc slipped 3.4 percent to  C$42.78, meanwhile, after Canada's largest wireless provider reported a slip in profit and disappointing mobile subscriber adds.      ""Maybe the expectations on a new CEO coming in and dazzling analysts with some new area of growth were too high, but as it declines I would see it as a buying opportunity,"" Sentry's Simpson said.

Valeant reported $5.8 billion in revenue last year.Pearson said he doesn't expect the offer to raise antitrust concerns.The Federal Trade Commission, which shares the work of antitrust enforcement with the U.S. Justice Department, will likely review this proposed transaction, according to an antitrust attorney, who declined to be named for business reasons.""It's like any of these big drug deals, if there's overlap in certain products then, like prior deals in this space, they can divest one of the products to get the deal through,"" the antitrust expert said.Valeant is already in talks with potential buyers of products the new company would divest, Pearson said, naming Valeant's Botox competitor, Dysport, as well as its Restylane and Perlane product lines.

24,"  (Adds Allergan adopting shareholder rights plan in paragraph 5)By Rod Nickel and Bill BerkrotApril 22 Canada's Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc said on Tuesday it and activist investor Bill Ackman made an unsolicited $47 billion bid to buy Botox maker Allergan Inc as it seeks to become one of the world's five biggest drug companies.The offer, if successful, would bring together two mid-sized pharmaceutical companies with expertise in skin care and eye care products, and is highly unusual as activist investors typically buy stakes and then agitate for strategic change.Ackman's Pershing Square Capital Management, Allergan's largest shareholder with a 9.7 percent stake, disclosed in a filing on Monday it is supporting the bid.Allergan said in a statement that it has received the offer, and will carefully consider the proposal and ""pursue the course of action that it believes is in the best interests of the company's stockholders.""Late on Tuesday, Allergan said it adopted a shareholder rights plan effective April 22 that will trigger if a person or group acquires 10 percent or more of its shares.Valeant offered to pay $48.30 a share in cash and 0.83 of its common share for each Allergan share, valuing Allergan at $152.88 a share, a premium of over 7 percent to the company's closing price on Monday. The offer is 31 percent higher than Allergan's stock price on April 10, the day before Pershing Square's ownership reached 5 percent.Shares of Allergan jumped 15.2 percent to $163.65 in New York, signaling investors expect a sweetened bid to emerge.Valeant stock rose 7.5 percent to $135.41.Valeant has been on a buying spree since 2010 and last year acquired contact lens maker Bausch & Lomb Holdings. Chief Executive Michael Pearson said in January the drugmaker wants to become one of the world's top five pharmaceutical companies by market capitalization by the end of 2016, largely through acquisitions.""The big valuation driver is Botox,"" Pearson said, speaking about the Allergan bid to about 200 shareholders and analysts in New York. Pearson said Allergan Chief Executive David Pyott and the company's board had been unwilling to discuss a merger with Valeant. In a letter to Allergan, Valeant said it would have preferred to negotiate a deal in private.Pearson said Valeant would definitely not turn its bid into an all-cash offer, and suggested the company could still walk away if Allergan's price gets too high.""We don't view this as we're going to pay whatever it takes to get Allergan, because we won't,"" he said. ""If someone wants to come in and pay some ridiculous cash price, that's their choice.""Ackman, who also addressed shareholders, called the deal the most synergistic he has seen, and said he is already talking with Valeant about their next deal. The Laval, Quebec-based company, whose products include antidepressant drug Wellbutrin and over-the-counter remedy Cold-FX, favors targets where it can aggressively cut costs. Valeant said it expects to realize at least $2.7 billion in annual cost synergies from a combination with Allergan.A large-scale cost-cutting approach may not work at Allergan without damaging the business, BMO Capital Markets analyst David Maris said in a note.But J.P.Morgan analyst Chris Schott said the potential for savings from operating expenses and Valeant's low tax rate is compelling.Allergan, which also has a lucrative portfolio of ophthalmic drugs to treat conditions such as glaucoma and dry eye, is larger by revenue, reporting $6.3 billion in sales last year.

Representatives for Allergan and Shire declined to comment.In a process known as inversion, U.S. drugmakers are looking to relocate their headquarters to other countries with lower tax rates. These companies are eying potential targets that are based in Ireland in particular because of a low 12.5 percent corporate tax rate, compared to 35 percent in the United States.Recent deals that have been driven by tax advantages include generic drugmaker Actavis Plc's $8.5 billion acquisition of Dublin-based Warner Chilcott and Perrigo Company Plc's $8.6 billion acquisition of Elan. Generic drugmaker Mylan Inc is also looking at acquisition targets that are based outside of the United States because of competitive pressures from rivals with a less burdensome tax structure, people familiar with the matter said.Valeant's offer for Allergan comes amid a flurry of healthcare deals this week including medical device company Zimmer Holdings Inc's $13.4 billion acquisition of rival Biomet; a $20 billion asset swap between Novartis AG and GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals PLC; and Eli Lilly and Co's acquisition of Novartis' animal health business for $5.4 billion. Those deals have driven healthcare M&A volumes to $153.3 billion so far this year, the highest year-to-date level since Thomson Reuters has started tracking data.

29,"  (This story originally appeared on IFR, a Thomson Reuters publication)By Danielle RobinsonNEW YORK, April 28 (IFR) - The heightened level of event risk in the pharmaceutical sector was demonstrated when Allergan, the pharma giant behind Botox, saw its bonds plunge some 10 price points on news that activist investor William Ackman and Valeant Pharmaceuticals International are spearheading an attempted hostile takeover of the company.Moody's and Fitch both moved Allergan's rating outlook to negative, warning that a successful takeover by the Canadian ""serial acquirer"" and Single B rated Valeant would crush Allergan's A3/A+ investment-grade credit rating.Allergan's 2.8% March 2023s plummeted on Tuesday to 84.58 in the secondary market on the news, where they were quoted at 225bp bid/175bp offer over Treasuries - sharply off from 94.53 and 80bp/70bp bid/ask the day before.Although Allergan quickly adopted a ""poison pill"" defence in an attempt to prevent a takeover, its spreads failed to return to their former levels, with the 2023s at 200bp on Thursday.Like many bonds of the best-rated pharmas, Allergan's US$2bn of outstanding debt does not have change-of-control covenants, leaving them open to being subordinated to secured debt of an acquirer like Valeant and a rapid tumble into junk-bond status.Even if the acquisition is not successful, the name has now been tainted by the agitating presence of Ackman.""Negative ratings pressure would stem from significant shareholder-friendly actions if Allergan stays independent, including leveraged share repurchases or special dividends,"" said Fitch pharma analyst Michael Zbinovec.Ackman's Pershing Square Capital Management, which currently holds 9.7% of Allergan, has teamed up with Valeant to mount the takeover bid, currently valued at US$45.6bn.Valeant is aiming to become one of the world's top five pharma companies by the end of 2016 and is just one of a swarm of companies in the sector on the hunt for acquisitions. ""We expect the next few years to be particularly active from an M&A perspective and pivotal in the reshaping of the industry,"" wrote Shubhomoy Mukherjee, a senior pharma credit analyst at Barclays, in an April 3 report, issued before the Valeant bid.Valeant is proposing to swap each Allergan share for US$48.3 in cash and 0.83 Valeant shares. It says it has committed financing from Barclays and Royal Bank of Canada for about US$15.5bn, which would be broken into ""secured bonds, unsecured bonds and bank debt [at an] expected interest rate of around 5.5% on new debt,"" Valeant said in a filing.That compares with Allergan 2023s yielding around 4.6% after news broke of the hostile takeover attempt.STRATEGIC OPTIONS  Big pharma companies such as Pfizer, Merck & Co and Sanofi, are seeking ""strategic options for non-core assets"", according to Barclays' Mukherjee, while generic drug companies suffering from slowing growth in that business are looking to build portfolios of branded drugs via acquisition.In the past week it was revealed that Pfizer, which has plans to split into three parts, had made an unsuccessful US$101bn run at AstraZeneca. Novartis also announced a flurry of purchases and divestments involving GlaxoSmithKline and Eli Lilly, which will see both Novartis and Lilly tap the bond markets for funds.Meanwhile, Teva has stated it is open to acquisitions and Mylan, which has just had its bid for Meda rejected, is looking to do a substantial transaction this year.""The opportunity is in the fact that the many participants grow so scared of M&A that credit spreads tend to overreact"".US companies seeking to lower their tax rates by re-domiciling to lower tax jurisdictions such as Ireland are also spurring acquisitions. DISTURBING The shareholder activist hook-up with a lower-rated firm to buy a higher-rated one is one of the more disturbing trends for bond investors.""Historically we have seen highly rated pharma companies taking over lower-rated ones,"" said Michael Levesque, pharma ratings analyst at Moody's.""In today's landscape the shape of M&A is up in the air - and as the Valeant/Allergan situation demonstrates, it could mean a lower-rated company successfully taking over a higher-rated one and saddling it with much higher leverage levels,"" he said.Many total return investors benchmarked to an index are avoiding the sector because of the event risk. ""The Valeant/Allergan deal has certainly raised red flags for us,"" said a senior portfolio manager of a total return fund with more than US$10bn in assets under management.But not all M&A is bad for investors, and with spreads at all-time tights, getting on the winning side of an M&A trade can generate significant alpha.""Frankly, in the bond market, the opportunity is in the fact that many participants grow so scared of M&A that credit spreads tend to overreact,"" said Scott Kimball, senior portfolio manager at Taplin, Canida & Habacht, part of the BMO Global Asset Management stable.""Yields spiking beyond those justified by the transaction leave companies that look fundamentally solid trading cheap.""

30,"   By Anjuli Davies, Sophie Sassard and Olivia Oran | LONDON/NEW YORK  LONDON/NEW YORK Allergan Inc (AGN.N), facing an unsolicited bid from Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc (VRTX.O), is preparing to approach Shire Plc (SHP.L) about a potential takeover, even though the Irish drugmaker rebuffed a previous overture, people familiar with the matter said on Monday.A bid by Allergan for Shire, which has a market value of $32 billion, would underscore how keen the U.S. dermatology drugmaker is to stay independent.Valeant teamed up with activist investor Bill Ackman earlier this month to make an unsolicited $47 billion offer for Allergan. Valeant has expanded through a series of acquisitions over the past few years. But Allergan has been reluctant to sell to it in part because of Valeant's reputation for cutting costs and spending little on research and development.Allergan had held talks in recent months with Shire about a potential takeover, but those did not pan out, Reuters reported last week.  The sources said Allergan is still interested in a deal with Shire and is planning a fresh approach, with the Valeant bid now also in the background.Allergan could come back for a bid as soon as the next few days, one person added. The plan has yet to be finalized and could change, cautioned the sources, who asked not to be named because the matter is not public. It is not clear if Shire would be open to entering into merger discussions.A representative of Allergan declined to comment, while Shire could not be immediately reached for comment. Valeant and Ackman's hedge fund Pershing Square declined to comment.Allergan's shares closed down 1.3 percent on Monday on the New York Stock Exchange. Shire's shares closed up 2.4 percent in London before the news of Allergan's renewed interest. A combination of Allergan and Shire would create a pharmaceutical giant with a combined market value of nearly $72 billion and annual sales of more than $11 billion.Analysts have suggested one way for the Botox maker to defend against the unsolicited bid would be to acquire foreign drugmakers such as Shire, Jazz Pharmaceuticals Plc (JAZZ.O) or Alkermes Plc (ALKS.O).A combination with Shire would help Allergan gain its top selling ADHD drug Vyvanse. It would also gain drugs for rare diseases like Elaprase for Hunter syndrome and Replagal for Fabry disease. Pharmaceutical companies are interested in developing or buying orphan drugs which affect a small patient population because there are fewer hurdles to regulatory approval, have lower marketing costs and can command high prices.Still, the Valeant bid could also complicate attempts by Allergan to find a white knight or buy someone else. As part of their strategy, Ackman bought a 9.7 percent stake in Allergan, becoming its largest shareholder.A transaction would add to a frenzy of deal-making currently going on in the healthcare sector, as the industry restructures amid healthcare spending cuts and competition from cheap generics.Deals totaling more than $153 billion have been struck so far this year, the highest year-to-date level since Thomson Reuters began tracking data. Pharmaceutical deals have accounted for 71 percent of overall healthcare deals. Buying Shire, which is based in Dublin, would also play to an increasingly popular trend that is driving M&A in healthcare and some other sectors these days: It could help lower Allergan's tax rate.In a process known as inversion, U.S. drugmakers seek to relocate their headquarters to other countries with lower tax rates. These companies are eying potential targets that are based in Ireland in particular because of a low 12.5 percent corporate tax rate, compared to 35 percent in the United States.Bankers say the tax benefits of inversion are driving several other deals in healthcare and beyond. On Monday, for example, Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) said it had approached Britain's AstraZeneca Plc (AZN.L) (AZN.N) to reignite a potential $100 billion takeover, in what would be the biggest foreign acquisition of a British company and one of the largest pharmaceutical deals. <ID: nL6N0NK194>That deal, if it were to happen, would also come with tax advantages. Pfizer could redomicile to Britain and enjoy lower tax rates, thanks to attractive incentives to companies that manufacture and hold patents in the country.Generic drugmaker Mylan Inc (MYL.O) is also looking at acquisition targets that are based outside of the United States because of competitive pressures from rivals with a less burdensome tax structure, and it has made an unsuccessful bid for Swedish drugmaker Meda MEDAa.ST.(Reporting by Anjuli Davies and Sophie Sassard in London, Additional reporting by Olivia Oran and Soyoung Kim in New York; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)",2014-04-29,AGN,"Mon Apr 28, 2014 | 8:19pm EDT",Exclusive: Allergan eyes new takeover bid for Shire - sources,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-shire-allergan-exclusive-idUSBREA3R16Y20140429?type=companyNews

An upbeat results statement lifted BP 0.7 percent and, along with Shire, the oil major was one of the biggest points contributors to the UK benchmark as it raised its quarterly dividend for the second time in six months and said more share buy-backs were on the cards.British wealth manager St. James's Place, which said it got off to a strong start in 2014, and hotel and coffee shop operator Whitbread, which beat full-year profit forecasts, both gained 1 percent. ""Investors are waiting to see the start of some positive earnings momentum, which has been missing in recent years.

42,"   By Rod Nickel and Ashutosh Pandey  Deal-making drugmaker Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc (VRX.TO) (VRX.N), together with activist investor Pershing Square, plan to push for changes on the board of Allergan Inc (AGN.N), which Valeant hopes to acquire.Billionaire Bill Ackman's hedge fund Pershing Square - which owns nearly 10 percent of Allergan - and Valeant will pursue ""at the appropriate time"" a special shareholder meeting to remove some or all directors on Allergan's board, Valeant Chief Financial Officer Howard Schiller said Thursday on a conference call about the company's quarterly results.In the meantime, Valeant has been meeting with shareholders of Allergan, some of whom overlap with Valeant's investors. Valeant said that it, together with Pershing, would seek a referendum of Allergan shareholders on support for its board to hold talks with Valeant.""It's clear that they really see the compelling nature of the transaction and we have strong, strong support to get this deal done,"" said Valeant Chief Executive Michael Pearson.""Their shareholders are speaking, and our shareholders are speaking, that they want us to focus on this and get it done and that's what we intend to do.""An Allergan spokesman declined to comment.According to Allergan's bylaws, the company will call a special meeting upon the written request of investors holding at least 25 percent of Allergan's outstanding shares of common stock.A series of agreed or proposed drug company deals may herald a new era of acquisitions not seen in the sector since last decade. U.S. drugmaker Pfizer (PFE.N) has bid for Britain's AstraZeneca (AZN.L), in what would potentially be the biggest ever foreign takeover of a British firm.Valeant reported a 35 percent jump in adjusted profit on Thursday, helped by robust drug sales in the United States and in its Bausch & Lomb eyecare business.Shares of Valeant edged up 0.3 percent to $133.80 in late morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange, while Allergan stock was up 0.1 percent at $166.11.The Laval, Quebec-based company teamed up with Pershing Square in April to make a cash-and-stock offer worth $47 billion for Allergan, the maker of Botox. Allergan has said it was reviewing the unsolicited bid.Allergan is likely worth more and a higher bid is likely, said Brian Acker, chief executive of Acker Finley Inc, a small investor in Valeant and Allergan.If Valeant lands Allergan, it can then aim at even bigger targets, Acker said.""If I were the other elephants out there, I'd be really worried,"" he said. ""If they do get Allergan, I think there's bigger game out there to go after."" Pearson said in January that Valeant was looking to become one of the world's top five pharmaceutical companies in terms of market capitalization by the end of 2016, largely through acquisitions. It is currently among the 15 biggest.Valeant was ready to negotiate and expected to hear from Allergan's board or management within the next few weeks, Schiller said.Even as it pursues its largest transaction, Valeant has been making smaller deals.

43,"  (Adds shareholder comment, detail on meeting requirement)By Rod Nickel and Ashutosh PandeyMay 8 Deal-making drugmaker Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc , together with activist investor Pershing Square, plan to push for changes on the board of Allergan Inc, which Valeant hopes to acquire.Billionaire Bill Ackman's hedge fund Pershing Square - which owns nearly 10 percent of Allergan - and Valeant will pursue ""at the appropriate time"" a special shareholder meeting to remove some or all directors on Allergan's board, Valeant Chief Financial Officer Howard Schiller said Thursday on a conference call about the company's quarterly results.In the meantime, Valeant has been meeting with shareholders of Allergan, some of whom overlap with Valeant's investors. Valeant said that it, together with Pershing, would seek a referendum of Allergan shareholders on support for its board to hold talks with Valeant.""It's clear that they really see the compelling nature of the transaction and we have strong, strong support to get this deal done,"" said Valeant Chief Executive Michael Pearson.""Their shareholders are speaking, and our shareholders are speaking, that they want us to focus on this and get it done and that's what we intend to do.""An Allergan spokesman declined to comment.According to Allergan's bylaws, the company will call a special meeting upon the written request of investors holding at least 25 percent of Allergan's outstanding shares of common stock. A series of agreed or proposed drug company deals may herald a new era of acquisitions not seen in the sector since last decade.U.S. drugmaker Pfizer has bid for Britain's AstraZeneca, in what would potentially be the biggest ever foreign takeover of a British firm.Valeant reported a 35 percent jump in adjusted profit on Thursday, helped by robust drug sales in the United States and in its Bausch & Lomb eyecare business.Shares of Valeant edged up 0.3 percent to $133.80 in late morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange, while Allergan stock was up 0.1 percent at $166.11. The Laval, Quebec-based company teamed up with Pershing Square in April to make a cash-and-stock offer worth $47 billion for Allergan, the maker of Botox.Allergan has said it was reviewing the unsolicited bid.Allergan is likely worth more and a higher bid is likely, said Brian Acker, chief executive of Acker Finley Inc, a small investor in Valeant and Allergan.If Valeant lands Allergan, it can then aim at even bigger targets, Acker said. ""If I were the other elephants out there, I'd be really worried,"" he said. ""If they do get Allergan, I think there's bigger game out there to go after.""Pearson said in January that Valeant was looking to become one of the world's top five pharmaceutical companies in terms of market capitalization by the end of 2016, largely through acquisitions. It is currently among the 15 biggest.Valeant was ready to negotiate and expected to hear from Allergan's board or management within the next few weeks, Schiller said.Even as it pursues its largest transaction, Valeant has been making smaller deals. Pearson said the company expects to sign or complete more than 20 deals worth about $900 million in total during the first half, including 10 transactions for about $200 million in the current quarter. Valeant is targeting deals in the Middle East, Indonesia and South Africa, Pearson said.Adjusted profit, which Valeant calls cash earnings, rose in the first quarter to $600 million, or $1.76 per share, excluding a $135 million charge related to the Bausch & Lomb acquisition last year for $8.7 billion and other one-time items.

47,"  * TSX rises 120.88 points, or 0.83 percent, to 14,654.94     * All of 10 main index sectors advance     * Valeant slips after Allergan rejects bid      By John Tilak     TORONTO, May 12 Canada's main stock index rose on Monday, reversing some of the previous week's losses, as shares of natural resource companies were buoyed by advances in the prices of commodities such as gold, copper and oil.     Commodity prices benefited from worries about the situation in eastern Ukraine, where pro-Moscow rebel leaders called for their region to become part of Russia, the day after staging a referendum on self-rule. Moscow, however, stopped short of endorsing their bid for annexation.      The Toronto market's advance came on the heels of a 1.6 percent drop in the previous week caused by concerns over Ukraine and a selloff in energy stocks.      The energy sector jumped 1.3 percent on Monday and had the biggest positive influence on the market. The group, one of the strongest performers this year, is up more than 14 percent so far in 2014.     ""We're seeing a new interest in oil and gas,"" said Michael Simpson, senior portfolio manager at Sentry Investments.      Higher oil prices and the prospects of a possible rise in natural gas prices were supporting energy shares, he added.     The Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P/TSX composite index  closed up 120.88 points, or 0.83 percent, at 14,654.94. It has added about 7.6 percent this year.     While stocks are not as cheap as they were a while ago, investors recognize that equities are ""a much better alternative to investing in bonds,"" Simpson said. But he added that ""some investors want to limit their exposure to Canada because they are seeing a stronger U.S. economy.""     All of the 10 main sectors on the index were higher on Monday.     A gain in the price of oil boosted the shares of energy producers. Canadian Natural Resources Ltd was up 2.3 percent at C$43.89, and Suncor Energy Inc rose 1.6 percent to C$42.80.      The materials sector, which includes mining stocks, was up 1.5 percent. Teck Resources Ltd added 4.1 percent to C$25.39, and First Quantum Minerals Ltd advanced 4.9 percent to C$22.04.     The price of bullion rose 0.7 percent, while copper jumped 2 percent.     In corporate news, U.S. drugmaker Allergan Inc  rejected Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc's  unsolicited takeover offer, saying it substantially undervalued the company. Valeant shares gave back 0.7 percent to C$141.98.

Commodity prices benefited from worries about the situation in Ukraine and a weaker U.S. dollar.      Ukrainian leader Oleksander Turchinov accused Russia of working to overthrow legitimate state power in Ukraine after pro-Russian rebels declared a victory in rebel referendums on self-rule in eastern regions.      The Toronto market's advance came on the heels of a 1.6 percent drop in the previous week, when the Ukraine concerns and a selloff in energy stocks weighed. The index is up about 7.4 percent this year.     The energy sector jumped 1.4 percent on Monday and had the biggest positive influence on the market.     ""We've got lots of momentum here. You can't argue with the tape,"" said David Cockfield, managing director and portfolio manager at Northland Wealth Management.     ""I'm reasonably positive on the oil sector,"" he added. ""But some of the multiples are getting a little bit high.""     Cockfield expects the Canadian market to outperform U.S. stocks this year, but he does anticipate a market correction at some point.     The Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P/TSX composite index  was up 93.72 points, or 0.64 percent, at 14,627.78. All of the 10 main sectors on the index were higher.     A gain in the price of oil boosted shares of energy producers. Canadian Natural Resources Ltd was up 1.8 percent at C$43.65, and Suncor Energy Inc gained 1.2 percent to C$42.63.      The materials sector, which includes mining stocks, climbed 1.5 percent. Teck Resources Ltd added 3.3 percent to C$25.19, First Quantum Minerals Ltd advanced 4 percent to C$21.84 and Goldcorp Inc rose 1.3 percent to C$27.45.

Encana climbed 2 percent after the natural gas producer said its first-quarter operating profit more than doubled, helped by higher gas prices and liquids production.      Feeding into the market mix was economic data from the world's two biggest economies. U.S. retail sales barely rose in April and a gauge of consumer spending slipped.      In China, figures showed a widespread slowing of economic activity in April, with data from output to investment and consumption all missing market expectations, increasing calls for government policies to support growth.      Investors were encouraged, however, by comments from two Bundesbank sources, who indicated that the German central bank was prepared to support European Central Bank policy action to boost the economy.      The Toronto Stock Exchange's benchmark index was up for a second straight session, and has gained about 7.8 percent this year.

67,"  (The opinions expressed here are those of Alison Frankel, a columnist for Reuters.)By Alison FrankelNEW YORK Valeant Pharmaceuticals and its hostile takeover partner William Ackman of Pershing Square Capital have a phalanx of lawyers working on their $47 billion bid for Allergan - Kirkland & Ellis for Ackman; Sullivan & Cromwell and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom for Valeant- so I don't know who deserves credit for the tactic they announced yesterday.But whoever came up with the idea of holding an unofficial meeting and proxy vote to give Allergan shareholders an opportunity to urge the board to enter discussions with Valeant is quite a strategist. The Ackman/Valeant proxy is apparently the first time a hostile bidder has called for a non-binding straw poll of shareholders but I bet it won't be the last.This is a win-win proposition for Ackman and Valeant, and here's why.To start, the unofficial meeting and proxy vote permit Allergan's bidders to avoid two different sorts of obstacles: the company's board-friendly corporate framework and its recently-adopted poison pill.Matt Levine at Bloomberg View did a great job Tuesday of explaining why Ackman -- who holds about 9.7 percent of Allergan's stock through Pershing -- can't talk directly to other shareholders for fear of crossing the 10 percent ""beneficial ownership"" threshold and triggering the poison pill. But the pill, Levine explained, has an exception for proxy solicitations like the one Ackman just launched.So the unofficial proxy vote permits Ackman and Valeant to show Allergan what major investors think without actually talking to shareholders.Plus, Ackman and Valeant don't have to worry about satisfying requirements in Allergan's corporate charter and bylaws for shareholder meetings. AN ADVISORY VOTE To convene a special meeting of shareholders - which they would have to do, since Allergan's regular annual meeting took place on May 6 - they'd have to obtain written consent from 25 percent of the shareholders. (Ronald Barusch of The Wall Street Journal's Dealpolitik detailed the special meeting process last week, after Valeant mentioned that it might go that route in a conference call with analysts.)Shareholders can bind the corporation through votes at special meetings, though there's a chance Allergan would claim that a newly-adopted bylaw amendment bars shareholders from replacing directors through a meeting convened by written consent. (It's complicated, but one pension fund shareholder explained why in a complaint filed last week against Allergan's board in Delaware Chancery Court.)None of that matters under Ackman's unofficial meeting strategy. The shareholder vote Ackman has launched doesn't seek to bind Allergan's board. It's just an advisory vote. ""SELF-SERVING EXERCISE"" So what does the vote accomplish? After all, even if a majority of Allergan shareholders vote yes on the Ackman resolution and request that the board enter discussions with Valeant - a high hurdle, considering that shareholders just elected nine board members by wide margins - the board is not bound by the vote.Allergan's official statement on the Ackman proxy hints that the company won't be influenced by the outcome of what it called ""a self-serving exercise"" that ignores ""the mechanism approved by the Allergan shareholders to call a special meeting."" But if Ackman and Valeant persuade even a sizable minority of Allergan shareholders that the board ought to talk to them, they'll have both a public relations victory and an argument that the board isn't living up to its fiduciary duties to shareholders.You can already envision Ackman's future Delaware Chancery Court class, asserting that Allergan board members disregarded a shareholder directive to explore Valeant's offer.I'm not saying Ackman would win the case based just on an advisory vote, but I'm sure Allergan's directors and their lawyers at Latham & Watkins will be thinking about the prospect of litigation when they decide how to respond to the proxy vote.That's the considerable upside for Valeant and Ackman if the vote goes their way: forcing talks through P.R. and the board's fear of litigation and liability. But what if Ackman's resolution gets only weak support from Allergan's shareholders?Here's the real beauty of Ackman's proxy play: Valeant probably wouldn't even have to report a bad outcome to the Securities and Exchange Commission, according to former SEC lawyer Seth Taube of Baker Botts.Obviously, the Allergan bid is material to Valeant, a public company. But an unfavorable result in a non-binding, unofficial shareholder vote, Taube said, is probably not material. ""I would think it's not a disclosable risk,"" Taube said.He also pointed out that the shareholders who vote on Ackman's resolution are likely to be those who support it. So there ought to be ways for Ackman and Valeant to spin the outcome even if they obtain support from a relatively small number of shareholders, by presenting yes votes as a percentage of the total votes rather than the total float.You really can't ask for a smarter strategy than one that lets Ackman and Valeant reach out to other shareholders without triggering the pill and positions them for a litigation challenge while costing them nothing more than the expense of a proxy contest. No wonder Matt Levine at Bloomberg has called the Allergan takeover battle ""a weird textbook for The Future of Mergers & Acquisitions.""

""People are getting out of the high momentum names and turning to less favored stocks, the ones that haven't been red hot in recent months.""     ""The attention is turning to groups that have not participated (in the rally) or that have been the target of disproportionate selloffs in recent months,"" he added. ""By that token, the gold group would certainly qualify.""     The Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P/TSX composite index  closed down 6.08 points, or 0.04 percent, at 14,673.73. Six of the 10 main sectors on the index were in the red.     Shares of energy producers lost 0.2 percent despite higher oil prices. Encana Corp dropped 1 percent to C$24.84, and Talisman Energy Inc fell 0.3 percent to C$11.60.     The healthcare sector gave back 0.9 percent, with Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc dropping 2.3 percent to C$138.22. Valeant said on Tuesday it will sweeten its unsolicited $47 billion takeover offer for drugmaker Allergan .      But gold-mining stocks advanced 0.9 percent. Barrick Gold Corp was up 0.6 percent at C$18.94, and Goldcorp Inc  rose 1.4 percent to C$27.52.     Shares of Sears Canada Inc jumped 3.4 percent to C$16.30 after parent company Sears Holdings Corp said it was looking to sell its 51 percent stake in the Canadian retailer.

Valeant shares jumped 3.7 percent after the drugmaker said that when it announces a sweetened takeover offer for Allergan Inc on May 28, it will not be the all-cash bid that had been expected.      Opening after a long weekend in Canada, the Toronto stock market's small gain follows declines in the previous three sessions. It is up 6.6 percent so far this year.     Some investors said that markets have been ignoring concerns about the pace of economic and earnings growth, raising worries about extended stock valuations.     ""The markets assumed all of the positives and didn't incorporate any of the negatives,"" said Subodh Kumar, chief investment strategist at Subodh Kumar & Associates, noting that investors are now factoring in geopolitical uncertainty, sluggish global growth and weaker-than-expected corporate revenue growth.     ""There is very little room for valuation expansion and there's potential for a pullback in the equity markets,"" he added. ""My basic view is that the markets probably won't end the year much higher than (where) they started.""     The Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P/TSX composite index  closed up 10.45 points, or 0.07 percent, at 14,525.19.     Kumar expects a correction in the Canadian benchmark midway through the year and a recovery towards the end of the year.     Six of the 10 main sectors on the index were higher on Tuesday.     The materials sector, which includes mining stocks, rose 0.4 percent, helped by gains in some commodity prices. Barrick Gold Corp added 0.5 percent to C$18.15, and Potash Corp  climbed 1.1 percent to C$40.58.     Shares of energy producers were up slightly despite a decline in the price of U.S. crude oil.

Valeant and activist investor Bill Ackman made an offer to buy Allergan on April 22, which Allergan spurned.

88,"  * Nestle will get N. America rights to skincare products* Valeant says deal clears way for it to buy Allergan   (Adds more analyst comments, background)By Martinne Geller and Alice BaghdjianLONDON/ZURICH, May 28 Swiss food group Nestle  accelerated a push into the fast-growing skincare market on Wednesday, buying the rights to several injectable treatments for facial wrinkles and lines from Valeant Pharmaceuticals International for $1.4 billion.The world's biggest food group, with brands including KitKat chocolate bars, Gerber baby food and Nescafe coffee, signalled its ambitions in skin health products in February by taking over the Galderma dermatology venture it had with L'Oreal.Wednesday's move gives Nestle the North American rights to some products taken on in that deal, boosting its control of the brands and avoiding the situation with KitKat, to which rival Hershey owns the rights in the United States.For Quebec-based Valeant, the cash deal clears a potential antitrust hurdle to its proposed $49 billion takeover of U.S. rival Allergan Inc, which makes Botox, used to treat conditions from frown lines to overactive bladder.For Nestle, the deal marks the latest step in a march begun almost two decades ago by Chairman and then-CEO Peter Brabeck-Lemathe to transform the sweets company into a global leader in nutrition, health and wellness, although some analysts question whether cosmetic skin treatments fit into that category.""They are trying to squeeze it under a wellness umbrella. It's a stretch,"" said a European food analyst.The world's biggest producers of packaged foods are moving increasingly towards healthier food products or personal care goods that offer faster sales growth and wider profit margins. Citing data from GlobalData Facial Aesthetics, Vontobel analysts said the U.S. market for Botox and other wrinkle fillers was set to grow from $2.5 billion in 2013 to $4.7 billion in 2018 - compound annual growth of 13.5 percent.""These figures speak for themselves and explain how strategic the deal is for Nestle/Galderma,"" said the analysts, who rate Nestle stock a ""buy"".Nestle shares, which have performed just ahead of the FTSE Eurofirst 300 Consumer Goods Index this year, were up 0.4 percent at 69.85 Swiss francs by 1515 GMT. SKIN FILLER Nestle said the deal with Valeant would give it the U.S. and Canadian rights to sell the Restylane, Perlane and Emervel injectable cosmetic treatments it already manufactures, as well as Dysport, a cosmetic treatment owned by Ipsen.It is also acquiring from Valeant a skin filler for cosmetic and medical use called Sculptra.Valeant, which inherited the North American rights in its 2012 acquisition of Medicis, said the deal fit with its plans. It raised its bid for Allergan a few hours after announcing the deal with Nestle.""By selling it ahead of time we have eliminated one more roadblock in terms of our integration with Allergan and we were able to get a price that was more than five times sales, so we think it also creates real shareholder value,"" said Valeant Chief Executive Michael Pearson. By comparison, Nestle paid 3.9 times sales to take over Galderma. Valeant's earlier, spurned offer for Allergan was worth 7.1 times sales.NESTLE HEALTH Beside its new Skin Health division, Nestle has a unit called Nestle Health Science that sells medical nutrition products for people with specific dietary needs related to illness or disease. It is also on a shortlist of bidders for the medical nutrition business of Danone, valued at about 4 billion euros ($5.5 billion), sources have told Reuters.Nestle Health Science is working as well to develop products in gastrointestinal, metabolic and brain health.""I can see the rationale behind that,"" said Berenberg Bank analyst Fintan Ryan. ""Nutrition and health is becoming more important to consumers, so it's increasingly going to be a bigger part of what Nestle does.""When it comes to the skin business, Ryan was more skeptical.""I don't see this being the future of Nestle,"" he said.

The revised, unsolicited offer was triggered by Pershing Square, the hedge fund controlled by Bill Ackman that is Allergan's biggest shareholder, agreeing to take only stock in Valeant for its Allergan shares. The offer is worth $53.8 billion, up from Wednesday's $49.9 billion bid.Allergan shares closed 5.7 percent higher at $167.46 while Valeant shares ended 1.5 percent higher at $131.21. BMO analyst David Maris said the revised offer will fall short, adding it seemed ""odd and erratic"" that Valeant would raise the bid two days after its chief executive, Mike Pearson,  promised not to negotiate against himself.   ""Like with marriages in olden days, when a dowry rises rapidly and without reason, you should take a closer look at the bride,"" Maris said.But analyst Ronny Gal of Bernstein Research said the offer increases pressure on Allergan to take action to raise the company's value and also to negotiate with Valeant. ""The offer now appears credible,"" he said. ""We do not think this is a 'done deal' by a long shot, but obviously the likelihood of success is higher now."" Allergan said in a statement that it plans to consider Valeant's latest proposal once it receives it. It is best known for its Botox medicine, which is injected into muscles to smooth wrinkles.       Ackman said he called Pearson on Friday morning and offered to take stock for his Allergan shares if Pearson increased the cash offer to other shareholders.    ""We believe that our gesture to the other Allergan owners makes an extraordinarily strong statement about our belief in the long-term value of this highly strategic business combination,"" Ackman said in a statement. The deal value is based on Allergan's 303.5 million diluted shares outstanding as of March 31, 2014, and Ackman’s holding of 28,878,638 shares. Along with cash and shares, it also includes the possibility of additional payments worth up to $7.6 billion related to future sales of an experimental eye drug.Valeant on Wednesday raised the cash component of its bid for Allergan, but the offer disappointed and both stocks dropped. Buying Allergan would push Valeant closer to its goal of becoming a top-five pharmaceutical company by market cap before the end of 2016, although Pearson also mused on Wednesday about potentially breaking up the company. Allergan has criticized the sustainability of Valeant's rapid growth through acquisitions, which included contact lens maker Bausch + Lomb last year.

94,"  * Valeant up 1.6 pct after it alters Allergan bid     * Market shrugs of disappointing GDP figures     * Key index has first monthly decline in 11 months in May   (Recasts with Valeant move, adds details, quotes, updates prices)     TORONTO, May 30 Canada's main stock index edged higher on Friday, pulled up by      Valeant Pharmaceuticals International after it again boosted the cash component of its takeover bid for drugmaker Allergan, a move that bucked up market sentiment following the release of weak economic growth figures early in the day.     Still, the Toronto stock market's benchmark index slipped 0.3 percent for May, its first monthly decline in nearly a year.     Valeant was the day's biggest net gainer after it adjusted its bid for Botox-maker Allergan Inc for the second time this week, contingent on the two sides negotiating. Valeant rose 1.6 percent to C$142.34.      That helped overshadow data that showed sluggish economic growth in the first quarter. Domestic gross domestic product (GDP) grew by an annualized 1.2 percent in the first three months, slower than the 1.8 percent expected by economists.       ""Investors are looking past the slower GDP numbers because the expectation is that the economy can certainly strengthen going forward,"" said Elvis Picardo, strategist at Global Securities     ""In the absence of a catastrophic event, the path of least resistance for the market is upward.""     The Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P/TSX composite index  ended up 15.21 points, or 0.1 percent, at 14,604.16. May was the first month the index has fallen since last June.     ""There's some caution that creeps in when you have advances month after month and perhaps this giveback is reflecting that caution,"" Picardo said.     Shares of Bombardier fell 2.4 percent to C$3.69  after the company said its new CSeries jet suffered an ""engine-related incident"" while stationary during maintenance testing. Flight testing of the aircraft has been halted, the company said.      Half of the index's 10 main sectors rose, including the mining-heavy materials sector, which added 0.6 percent, while shares of energy companies gained 0.3 percent.

99,"   By Rod Nickel and Ransdell Pierson  Valeant Pharmaceuticals Inc (VRX.TO) on Monday prepared to take its $53.8 billion takeover bid for Allergan Inc (AGN.N) directly to the Botox maker's shareholders in a battle that could last late into the year.The fight escalated when Valeant ally Pershing Square, a hedge fund that owns 9.7 percent of Allergan, called for a meeting to replace the company's board.Pershing Square Chief Executive Officer Bill Ackman, in a conference call with Valeant CEO Mike Pearson, told investors he had requested a special meeting that could take place as early as Aug. 7. Allergan could also delay the meeting, where Pershing intends to replace a majority or more of the company's directors, to as late as November, Ackman said.Pearson said Valeant expected in two to three weeks to file an exchange offer, a means of taking the bid to Allergan shareholders, with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. He also urged Allergan to negotiate with Valeant.""We will be patient,"" Pearson said. ""We will get this deal done."" Allergan, whose Botox medicine is injected into muscles to smooth wrinkles, said it would consider Valeant's latest offer. Laval, Quebec-based Valeant said on Friday that it would pay $72 in cash and 0.83 share of its stock for each Allergan share, increasing its offer for the second time last week. Valeant is also offering possible additional payments related to future sales of an experimental eye drug that Allergan owns.    In a statement, Allergan urged shareholders not to act on the bid until its board makes a recommendation. The drawn-out process to a special meeting would benefit Valeant since an increase in its share price during that time would boost the value of its offer and make a merger more likely, said Sterne Agee analyst Shibani Malhotra.Malhotra said he doubted Allergan would let the situation escalate to a proxy battle at the special meeting but was more likely to develop its own plan or negotiate better terms with Valeant.BMO analyst David Maris said Allergan had options such as a share buyback, a dividend increase or combination with other companies. Ackman said he had met last week with six major Allergan shareholders with a combined 19 percent stake, and they said they believed the merger makes sense. He said he was scrapping plans for a non-binding referendum as a means of pressuring the company to negotiate, based on shareholder feedback.Analysts peg the value of Valeant's bid, prior to Monday's trading, at roughly $180 to $184 per Allergan share. Shares of Allergan were up 2.6 percent at $171.80 in afternoon New York Stock Exchange trading. Valeant gained 2.2 percent to C$145.50 in Toronto and rose 1.6 percent to $133.36 in New York.

102,"  (Recasts, updates share movement)     By Rod Nickel and Ransdell Pierson     June 2 Valeant Pharmaceuticals Inc on Monday prepared to take its $53.8 billion takeover bid for Allergan Inc directly to the Botox maker's shareholders in a battle that could last late into the year.     The fight escalated when Valeant ally Pershing Square, a hedge fund that owns 9.7 percent of Allergan, called for a meeting to replace the company's board.     Pershing Square Chief Executive Officer Bill Ackman, in a conference call with Valeant CEO Mike Pearson, told investors he had requested a special meeting that could take place as early as Aug. 7. Allergan could also delay the meeting, where Pershing intends to replace a majority or more of the company's directors, to as late as November, Ackman said.     Pearson said Valeant expected in two to three weeks to file an exchange offer, a means of taking the bid to Allergan shareholders, with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. He also urged Allergan to negotiate with Valeant.     ""We will be patient,"" Pearson said. ""We will get this deal done.""     Allergan, whose Botox medicine is injected into muscles to smooth wrinkles, said it would consider Valeant's latest offer. Laval, Quebec-based Valeant said on Friday that it would pay $72 in cash and 0.83 share of its stock for each Allergan share, increasing its offer for the second time last week.      Valeant is also offering possible additional payments related to future sales of an experimental eye drug that Allergan owns.             In a statement, Allergan urged shareholders not to act on the bid until its board makes a recommendation.     The drawn-out process to a special meeting would benefit Valeant since an increase in its share price during that time would boost the value of its offer and make a merger more likely, said Sterne Agee analyst Shibani Malhotra.     Malhotra said he doubted Allergan would let the situation escalate to a proxy battle at the special meeting but was more likely to develop its own plan or negotiate better terms with Valeant.     BMO analyst David Maris said Allergan had options such as a share buyback, a dividend increase or combination with other companies.     Ackman said he had met last week with six major Allergan shareholders with a combined 19 percent stake, and they said they believed the merger makes sense. He said he was scrapping plans for a non-binding referendum as a means of pressuring the company to negotiate, based on shareholder feedback.     Analysts peg the value of Valeant's bid, prior to Monday's trading, at roughly $180 to $184 per Allergan share.      Shares of Allergan were up 2.6 percent at $171.80 in afternoon New York Stock Exchange trading. Valeant gained 2.2 percent to C$145.50 in Toronto and rose 1.6 percent to $133.36 in New York.

114,"   By Caroline Humer and Ransdell Pierson  The battle for botox maker Allergan Inc heated up on Tuesday as the company officially rejected a sweetened $53 billion takeover offer from Valeant Pharmaceuticals International and activist investor William Ackman.Since Canadian drugmaker Valeant and Pershing Square Capital Management made a joint bid for the company on April 22, Allergan has stood firm against entreaties to sit down at the table and negotiate a deal.Ackman, who has almost a 10 percent stake in Allergan, and Valeant raised their joint offer on May 28 and when investors were displeased and sold shares, added even more cash to it on May 30. He also said that he would call shareholders to a vote.On Tuesday, Allergan once again declined the bid, saying that the offer undervalues the company and is too risky for shareholders. Allergan also reissued criticisms of Valeant's business model, saying that its reporting of financial information was opaque. ""We do not believe your latest proposal offers sufficient or certain value to warrant discussions between Allergan and Valeant,"" Allergan Chief Executive Officer David Pyott said in a letter to Valeant CEO Michael Pearson.A Valeant spokeswoman said that given Allergan's rejection, the company would move forward with its plan to take the deal to shareholders for a vote. The first step in that battle would be to elect a Valeant-Ackman backed board of directors at Allergan. A shareholder meeting to do that could be held in November. ""Valeant’s offer to combine with Allergan will create substantial value for both companies’ shareholders, and we look forward to giving Allergan shareholders the opportunity to speak for themselves,"" Valeant spokeswoman Laurie Little said in a statement.Pyott said in an interview with Reuters that he was in for a long slog. ""I'm an endurance player; I climbed Kilimanjaro last year,"" Pyott said. He said shareholders wanted the company to use the $14 billion in cash flow it would generate over the next five years for acquisitions.     Allergan can pursue other options, BMO Capital Markets analyst David Maris said.    ""We continue to believe that Allergan has many options, including a buyback, dividend, combination with others - or even some combination of these,"" Maris said in a research note.The offer, which includes $72 in cash plus 0.83 Valeant shares, is currently worth about $177 per share, or $53 billion.

115,"  (Adds Allergan CEO comments, Valeant reaction)By Caroline Humer and Ransdell PiersonJune 10 The battle for botox maker Allergan Inc  heated up on Tuesday as the company officially rejected a sweetened $53 billion takeover offer from Valeant Pharmaceuticals International and activist investor William Ackman.Since Canadian drugmaker Valeant and Pershing Square Capital Management made a joint bid for the company on April 22, Allergan has stood firm against entreaties to sit down at the table and negotiate a deal.Ackman, who has almost a 10 percent stake in Allergan, and Valeant raised their joint offer on May 28 and when investors were displeased and sold shares, added even more cash to it on May 30. He also said that he would call shareholders to a vote.On Tuesday, Allergan once again declined the bid, saying that the offer undervalues the company and is too risky for shareholders. Allergan also reissued criticisms of Valeant's business model, saying that its reporting of financial information was opaque.""We do not believe your latest proposal offers sufficient or certain value to warrant discussions between Allergan and Valeant,"" Allergan Chief Executive Officer David Pyott said in a letter to Valeant CEO Michael Pearson. A Valeant spokeswoman said that given Allergan's rejection, the company would move forward with its plan to take the deal to shareholders for a vote. The first step in that battle would be to elect a Valeant-Ackman backed board of directors at Allergan. A shareholder meeting to do that could be held in November.""Valeant's offer to combine with Allergan will create substantial value for both companies' shareholders, and we look forward to giving Allergan shareholders the opportunity to speak for themselves,"" Valeant spokeswoman Laurie Little said in a statement.Pyott said in an interview with Reuters that he was in for a long slog. ""I'm an endurance player; I climbed Kilimanjaro last year,"" Pyott said. He said shareholders wanted the company to use the $14 billion in cash flow it would generate over the next five years for acquisitions.Allergan can pursue other options, BMO Capital Markets analyst David Maris said.""We continue to believe that Allergan has many options, including a buyback, dividend, combination with others - or even some combination of these,"" Maris said in a research note. The offer, which includes $72 in cash plus 0.83 Valeant shares, is currently worth about $177 per share, or $53 billion. The deal value is calculated based on 303.5 million diluted shares outstanding as of March 31, 2014 and Ackman's holding of 28,878,638 shares.Ackman was not immediately available for comment.Allergan shares were down 0.6 percent at $163.17 and Valeant shares fell 1.8 percent to $124.41 by around 1:30 p.m. (1730 GMT).Allergan shares are far off the $177 per share price implicit in the Valeant offer.""It suggests that the market is still not going to go for it at the current price,"" Morningstar Research analyst Michael Waterhouse said.

The suit seeks to confirm that Ackman is not about to trigger Allergan's poison pill takeover defense as it seeks shareholder support for the meeting. Allergan, which makes Botox for wrinkles and other uses, has rejected a $53 billion joint offer from Ackman and Valeant. Ackman last week filed documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission that would start a proxy battle.Allergan and Valeant both declined to comment on the suit.Allergan adopted a one-year shareholder rights plan, often called a poison pill, on April 22, the day Valeant and Ackman made their offer. The company said it needed time to consider takeover proposals. Allergan's pill will be triggered if a person or group acquires 10 percent or more of its shares. A poison pill aims to dilute a stock's value by flooding the market with more shares; this makes it pricier for a shareholder to get a controlling stake.The lawsuit filed in Delaware Court of Chancery said it followed a request to Allergan from Pershing Square on June 6 seeking confirmation that Allergan would not use its poison pill to impede Ackman's request for a special meeting.Allergan's bylaws require that a group calling a special meeting collectively represents 25 percent of shares outstanding. In the suit, Ackman says he is concerned that by calling the meeting, it will trigger the pill. A response from Allergan’s counsel dated June 11 did not provide confirmation that it would not, the document said.Allergan said in the letter to Pershing Square that its solicitation and receipt of proxies from other Allergan stockholders for the purpose of requesting a special meeting would not, in and of itself, trigger the pill. Allergan declined to answer more specific questions about the details of Pershing Square's plan for soliciting those proxies in the absence of all the facts, according to a copy of the letter included in the lawsuit.Allergan rejected a sweetened offer from Valeant and the activist investor on Tuesday.

(Allergan statement: r.reuters.com/jep22w)Allergan said that in a May 13 email to Chief Executive Officer David Pyott and Chief Financial Officer Jeff Edwards, Morgan Stanley's global head of M&A Robert Kindler said the company could be more aggressive in going after Valeant's business model and the value of its stock.David Horn, a managing director at Morgan Stanley's healthcare group, followed up with an email to Edwards on May 18.""Part of what Rob (Kindler) is suggesting (to Allergan) is to allow him to use his significant relationships with media and analysts to provide a clear and detailed articulation of why Valeant is a house of cards and your investors should not want to take their stock,"" Horn said in one of the email exchanges shown by Allergan.Representatives of Morgan Stanley and Allergan declined to comment.""Kindler is one of the best M&A bankers out there.

""It’s clear that Allergan's release is a sign of desperation, and we look forward to proving the naysayers wrong.""  In addition to the email exchanges with Morgan Stanley, the drugmaker in its statement also released third-party views from analysts, investors and media that question Valeant's business model.Morgan Stanley, like other investment banks, pitched for business from both Allergan and Valeant as the bidding war  escalated. Banks have different teams that work with different clients, which sometimes have divergent interests.In its Allergan pitch, Morgan Stanley argued that Allergan's financial adviser, Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), is not outspoken enough in attacking Valeant's stock value because the bank is historically close to the Canadian drugmaker and has done a lot of business with the company, people familiar with the matter said.Goldman advised Valeant in its Bausch & Lomb purchase last year and provided committed financing for the transaction. Valeant's chief financial officer, Howard Schiller, was a long-time Goldman executive. Allergan chose not to add Morgan Stanley to its team of financial advisers, partly because the bank has a potential conflict having an overweight rating on Valeant's stock, people familiar with the matter said.Valeant and its ally Pershing Square Capital Management - Allergan's biggest shareholder - have offered to buy Allergan  for $53 billion in cash and shares. Allergan has rejected the offer and refused to negotiate, leading Pershing to move toward replacing most of Allergan's board at a special meeting. However, Valeant's Toronto-listed stock has fallen in recent weeks, with Allergan stepping up its attack on the rival's business model. Shares of Valeant have fallen nearly 7 percent in the last five days, while the S&P 500 has remained flat. Allergan has argued that Valeant shuns research and development and relies solely on acquisitions to drive growth, a model which it calls unsustainable. Allergan has compared Valeant to Tyco, the scandal-plagued company which built itself up through acquisitions and then collapsed.  Valeant has defended itself, with Ackman arguing that the company's business model is more similar to Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) than to Tyco. Allergan is working with Goldman Sachs and Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAC.N) and legal advisers Latham & Watkins, Richards, Layton & Finger and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz.Valeant, which has been working with Barclays Plc (BARC.L) and RBC Capital Markets (RY.TO) for the past few months, has recently added Morgan Stanley as a financial adviser, people familiar with the matter said.Valeant decided to bring in Morgan Stanley for its expertise in advising on hostile deals. While the company initially believed Allergan would eventually come to the negotiating table, the target's repeated rejections made it clear the effort was headed for all-out hostile bidding.Companies often choose to hire additional advisers in protracted, complicated takeover battles. When Sanofi SA (SASY.PA) made a hostile bid for Genzyme in 2010, which  succeeded eventually, Morgan Stanley was brought on several weeks into the process.

Valeant's chief financial officer, Howard Schiller, was a long-time Goldman executive.Allergan chose not to add Morgan Stanley to its team of financial advisers, partly because the bank has a potential conflict having an overweight rating on Valeant's stock, people familiar with the matter said.Valeant and its ally Pershing Square Capital Management - Allergan's biggest shareholder - have offered to buy Allergan  for $53 billion in cash and shares. Allergan has rejected the offer and refused to negotiate, leading Pershing to move toward replacing most of Allergan's board at a special meeting. However, Valeant's Toronto-listed stock has fallen in recent weeks, with Allergan stepping up its attack on the rival's business model. Shares of Valeant have fallen nearly 7 percent in the last five days, while the S&P 500 has remained flat.Allergan has argued that Valeant shuns research and development and relies solely on acquisitions to drive growth, a model which it calls unsustainable. Allergan has compared Valeant to Tyco, the scandal-plagued company which built itself up through acquisitions and then collapsed.Valeant has defended itself, with Ackman arguing that the company's business model is more similar to Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc than to Tyco.Allergan is working with Goldman Sachs and Bank of America Merrill Lynch and legal advisers Latham & Watkins, Richards, Layton & Finger and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz.Valeant, which has been working with Barclays Plc  and RBC Capital Markets for the past few months, has recently added Morgan Stanley as a financial adviser, people familiar with the matter said.Valeant decided to bring in Morgan Stanley for its expertise in advising on hostile deals. While the company initially believed Allergan would eventually come to the negotiating table, the target's repeated rejections made it clear the effort was headed for all-out hostile bidding.Companies often choose to hire additional advisers in protracted, complicated takeover battles. When Sanofi SA  made a hostile bid for Genzyme in 2010, which  succeeded eventually, Morgan Stanley was brought on several weeks into the process.

130,"   By Soyoung Kim and Olivia Oran | NEW YORK, June 16  NEW YORK, June 16 Morgan Stanley, an adviser to Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc in its $53 billion hostile bid for Allergan Inc, initially tried to get hired by Allergan and in its pitch called the unsolicited bidder a ""house of cards"", according to Allergan.The Botox maker released email exchanges with Morgan Stanley bankers on Monday, which reveal the bankers were pitching for a defense assignment from Allergan, offering advice as to how the company could successfully defend the unwanted suitor.""Executives from Morgan Stanley, the investment bank understood to have recently been retained by Valeant, have sent emails directly to Allergan's management team that suggest they share the concerns of Allergan...,"" the company said in a statement.In a May 13 email to Allergan Chief Executive David Pyott and Chief Financial Officer Jeff Edwards, Morgan Stanley's global head of M&A Robert Kindler said the company could be more aggressive in going after Valeant's business model and the value of its stock. David Horn, a managing director at Morgan Stanley's healthcare group, followed up with an email to Edwards on May 18.""Part of what Rob (Kindler) is suggesting (to Allergan) is to allow him to use his significant relationships with media and analysts to provide a clear and detailed articulation of why Valeant is a house of cards and your investors should not want to take their stock,"" Horn said.Representatives of Morgan Stanley did not immediately respond to requests for comment, while Allergan declined to comment. Valeant could not be immediately reached for comment. Valeant and its ally Pershing Square Capital Management - Allergan's biggest shareholder - have offered to buy Allergan  for $53 billion in cash and shares.

131,"   By Rod Nickel  Valeant Pharmaceuticals Inc (VRX.TO) said on Tuesday it will launch an exchange offer for Allergan Inc (AGN.N) this week, allowing it to eventually take the unsolicited bid directly to shareholders. Botox-maker Allergan has rejected Valeant’s offer of cash and shares, but Valeant Chief Executive Officer Mike Pearson said he sees no reason to adjust the bid a third time. Valeant shares have lost ground for 10 straight sessions through Monday, reducing the value of its Allergan bid to about $50.8 billion from $53.8 billion on May 30.""Hostile is not our preferred approach,"" Pearson said. ""But this deal was so strategic and financially compelling that it really makes sense.""Valeant's stock is ""artificially depressed,"" Pearson said, after weeks of criticism by Allergan and some analysts.Shares of Valeant rose 0.2 percent at $118 on the New York Stock Exchange in early trading. Allergan stock was up 0.5 percent at $160.12. Valeant held a webcast to rebut Allergan's latest criticism and clarify steps toward a hostile takeover, which could drag into 2015. Allergan's biggest shareholder, Pershing Square Capital Management, intends to mail proxy materials as early as this month to seek a special meeting later this year to change most of Allergan’s board, Valeant said. At the same time, Pershing is suing Allergan to confirm its special meeting would not trigger the company's poison pill takeover defense.To trigger a special meeting, Pershing needs to gain additional support of shareholders representing 15.3 percent of Allergan's ownership, topping up its own 9.7 percent stake for a total of 25 percent.  Valeant Chief Financial Officer Howard Schiller said the company is confident enough Allergan shareholders will support calling the meeting, noting that more than half of Allergan's shares have traded since word of Valeant's initial offer leaked on April 21. Hedge funds and arbitrageurs who are interested in a deal now own a large percentage of Allergan, Schiller said.In a statement, Allergan spokeswoman Bonnie Jacobs said;“We are confident Allergan can create significantly more value for stockholders than Valeant’s proposal, which substantially undervalues the company, creates significant risks and uncertainties for Allergan’s stockholders and is not in the best interests of the company and its stockholders.” Assuming Allergan shareholders remove most of the board at the meeting by the end of 2014, Valeant said holders of at least 10 percent of Allergan shares can then apply to court for another meeting to elect replacement directors, a process that could take another two months. The new Allergan board could then negotiate a deal with Valeant and close its exchange offer.The battle of words and presentation slides between the two companies has ranged from Valeant's acquisition-focused business model and accounting methods to Allergan's research and development costs. On Monday, the saga took a surprising twist when Allergan released private email comments it received from Morgan Stanley. The investment bank, which was pitching to advise Allergan before Valeant hired it, was quoted by Allergan calling Valeant a ""house of cards.""Pearson said Allergan's move was ""just a little bit of noise"" and Morgan Stanley continues to advise Valeant.

137,"   By Deena Beasley | SAN DIEGO  SAN DIEGO Allergan Inc (AGN.N), seeking to win over shareholders as it fights a hostile takeover offer from Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc (VRX.TO), will raise its earnings outlook when it reports second-quarter results, said Chief Executive Officer David Pyott.The CEO and Allergan's board earlier on Monday encouraged  investors not to sell their shares to Valeant, calling the Canada-based company's offer ""grossly inadequate.""Pyott, speaking on the sidelines of the annual BIO International Convention, said shareholders are vocal in asking that the California-based Botox maker boost earnings and deploy capital - in the form of share buybacks or a significant acquisition.""Our goal now is to give them most of what they want,"" he said. ""We will raise earnings guidance further."" He noted that the company will release quarterly results in late July or early August. In May, Allergan said it expected full-year 2014 earnings of between $5.64 and $5.73 per share. Since then, Allergan has set targets for lower spending and committed to increasing adjusted earnings by 20 percent annually and to generate $14 billion in free cash flow in the next five years.Pyott said Allergan could make an acquisition for as much as $10 billion with ""no sweat."" He said Allergan is always on the lookout for strategic deals that offer technology and growth, but said tax considerations would be of tertiary concern.Part of Valeant's case for the nearly $53 billion acquisition is that its Canadian tax rate is lower than Allergan's U.S. rate. If an appealing acquisition target does not emerge, most shareholders would be in favor of a stock buyback before a special dividend, Pyott said.""It's now a case of what selective reductions we will be making ourselves,"" he said, referring to previously announced plans to trim spending, including on research and development. ""Clearly, the market is saying the short-term is what you are measured by."" Valeant and activist investor William Ackman, who owns a stake of nearly 10 percent in Allergan, made a joint bid to acquire the company in April. Allergan said in a statement that because of Valeant's declining share price, the latest offer is now worth about $173.20 per share, down from the $179.25 per share it reached on May 30.Pyott said other drugmakers at the San Diego convention ""understand that if we were to succumb to this, then somebody even bigger is next on the menu, or at least a lot of them will be afternoon snacks.""

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry met Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki to push for more inclusive leadership as government forces abandoned the border with Jordan, leaving Iraq's entire Western frontier outside government control.

U.S. housing and manufacturing data also painted a promising picture.         Some fund managers fear the Toronto market, which had its highest-ever close last week, might have run ahead of itself and see few catalysts that could fuel further gains.

""Those catalysts that could push oil higher are more of a bet than a probability.     ""Would I be going gangbusters about the TSX over the next three months? Probably not,"" he added.

140,"   By Ben Hirschler | LONDON  LONDON Shire (SHP.L) flagged the promise of existing and new drugs on Monday as evidence that AbbVie's (ABBV.N) $46 billion offer undervalued the company, the latest British firm to be targeted by a U.S. group seeking lower taxes.Shire is taking a leaf out of AstraZeneca's (AZN.L) playbook by disclosing long-range internal forecasts - a tactic used successfully by its larger London-listed rival in fending off a $118 billion bid from Pfizer (PFE.N). Chief Executive Flemming Ornskov said on Monday that current products would generate sales of at least $7 billion by 2020, with $3 billion more coming from drugs still in the pipeline.Shire also said that in the medium term it expected sales of $6.5 billion by 2016. The company, best known for hyperactivity and rare-disease drugs, had said on Friday it was aiming to more than double sales to $10 billion by 2020 without giving details.Ornskov told Reuters that actual sales could be far above $10 billion, since the long-term forecasts did not include revenue from future deal-making or from two recent transactions.""M&A will clearly add growth to the profile,"" he said in an interview, noting that the London-listed company had done six deals since he took over 13 months ago. ""If I included that in the upside it would be way north of $10 billion.""Shire is a serial acquirer, buying rare disease specialist Viropharma for $4.2 billion last November in its biggest deal yet - and Ornskov said further ""large"" deals were possible.As with AstraZeneca's earlier upbeat long-term forecasts, many industry analysts view Shire's $10 billion sales prediction as optimistic, with Credit Suisse saying its own estimates suggested sales of around $8 billion by 2020.Nonetheless, the confident performance may encourage AbbVie to dig deeper after the two companies confirmed a series of approaches following a Reuters report last week.  Analysts at Jefferies estimated the U.S. company could make the deal pay at a price of up to 55 pounds a share, or $55 billion, against AbbVie's most recent rejected cash-and-shares offer on May 30 of just over 46 pounds. Shares in Shire, which hit a all-time high on Friday, ended 1.6 percent lower at 43.03 pounds.Key drugs that Ornskov expects to drive continued strong growth include its best-selling hyperactivity medicine Vyvanse, which is now also being tested as a treatment for binge eating, as well as a much-anticipated drug for dry eye disease called lifitegrast, which it sees as a potential $1 billion-plus seller.Shire is famous for drugs to treat children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder but Ornskov said it had become ""more and more a rare disease company"". The market had yet to catch up fully with the rapid growth and high margins this shift implied, he argued, pointing to the 99 percent total shareholder return achieved since he took over last May. INVERSION AVERSION Shire's strategy copies AstraZeneca's in another way, too, by highlighting the execution risks associated with AbbVie's plan to cut its tax bill through redomiciling in Britain for tax purposes - an industry-wide ploy that has sparked growing political concerns. Such so-called ""inversions"" by U.S. companies have moved centre-stage in the pharmaceuticals sector this year, with those firms still paying high tax rates anxious to strike deals that will help them compete with rivals now enjoying lower taxes.Whether Shire, long viewed as a likely takeover target, escapes the clutches of a larger predator is uncertain and the company is widely seen as more vulnerable to a takeover by AbbVie - or another company - than AstraZeneca.  That reflects both its smaller size, which makes it a more manageable target for a wider range of players, and the lack of attendant political issues in Britain, where the company has a relatively small workforce.Although established in Britain in 1986 and listed in London, Shire conducts most of its business in the United States and has been resident in Ireland for tax purposes since 2008.Other companies that industry sources say have looked at Shire in the past include Allergan AGN.L, itself the target of a takeover approach by Valeant (VRX.TO). Banking sources suggest Shire could also appeal to groups such as Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY.N) and Gilead Sciences (GILD.O). Ornskov declined to comment on whether Shire had received approaches from companies other than AbbVie.One senior banker described Shire as a ""valued inversion target"" but he stressed that potential bidders still needed to demonstrate a tie-up also made strategic sense. For AbbVie CEO Richard Gonzalez, Shire fits the bill in one important respect: it offers a way to reduce his firm's over-reliance on rheumatoid arthritis drug Humira, the world's top-selling medicine, which accounted for 58 percent of the company's sales in the first quarter but which loses U.S. patent protection in late 2016. AbbVie itself raised in 2014 profit forecast on Monday, citing strong recent business performance.

The materials sector, which includes mining stocks, advanced 1 percent, helped by an increase in copper prices. First Quantum Minerals Ltd jumped 1.4 percent to C$22.03.

145,"   By Nadia Damouni and Olivia Oran | New York  New York Hedge fund Paulson & Co has amassed a large stake in Allergan Inc (AGN.N) of more than 6 million shares and supports a deal between the Botox maker and Valeant Pharmaceuticals Inc (VRX.TO), people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.The position is expected to make the prominent U.S. hedge fund, led by John Paulson, one of the top 10 to 15 holders of Allergan, according to Thomson Reuters shareholder data as of March 31. Paulson's new position in Allergan could give Valeant a boost, as the company tries to drum up support from at least 25 percent of Allergan shareholders so that it can call a special meeting. Valeant and its ally, Bill Ackman's Pershing Square Capital Management, are seeking to call a meeting to elect new directors to Allergan's board, which could pave the way for a takeover of the company.Allergan shares closed up 2.3 percent on Wednesday at $169.07, while Valeant shares closed up 4.5 percent at $125.94, both on the New York Stock Exchange.Valeant has taken its offer directly to Allergan shareholders after Allergan rejected its latest $53 billion takeover bid, comprised of $72 in cash and 0.83 share of Valeant stock per Allergan share. Valeant last week began an exchange offer for the Irvine, California-based company. Allergan advised investors on Monday not to accept Valeant's offer, which it characterized as ""grossly inadequate."" Valeant, Allergan and Paulson declined to comment.Other large Allergan shareholders - including T.Rowe Price, ranked as the ninth largest holder as of March 31 - are pushing for a deal with Valeant, people familiar with the matter said.T.Rowe Price has a larger position in Valeant, and ranks as the company's fourth largest shareholder, according to Thomson Reuters data as of March 31.  A spokesperson for T. Rowe could not immediately be reached for comment.     But some Allergan shareholders believe the company should remain stand-alone, based on the value of the current Valeant offer, said Dan Davidowitz, a portfolio manager at Polen Capital Management LLC in Boca Raton, Florida, which is a top 20 Allergan holder.Valeant CEO Michael Pearson said he believes he has support from the majority of Allergan shareholders for the deal.  ""We are confident that shareholders will strongly support our deal in a vote,"" he said during an interview with Reuters on Tuesday.Ackman has been trying to encourage Allergan shareholders to consider a deal with Valeant. He has gauged interest from some large holders about whether they would consider accepting a larger proportion of Valeant stock in a show of support for the company's Allergan bid, people said this week.     The move, if successful, would free up more cash for other shareholders who have expressed some concern about accepting Valeant stock for their Allergan shares. It would also demonstrate that bigger investors are committed to doing a deal, despite Allergan's steady criticism of Valeant's acquisition-based business model.    Pershing Square, Allergan's biggest shareholder, agreed last month to take only Valeant stock in exchange for its Allergan shares.

160,"  (Adds company comment from conference call, analyst comment; updates share movement)By Bill BerkrotJune 30 Allergan Inc said on Monday that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration would not approve its acute migraine aerosol treatment until certain concerns are addressed, but the agency approved a new use for its implantable eye drug, Ozurdex.The Botox maker, which is fighting a hostile takeover bid by Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc, said Semprana, formerly known as Levadex, had received a second ""complete response letter"" from the FDA delaying its approval. Allergan now expects the agency's next action in the second quarter of 2015.Allergan shares were down 2.4 percent at $169.81.In its letter, the FDA expressed concern about the delivery device for the aerosol migraine medication, citing ""content uniformity on the improved canister filling process and on standards for device actuation,"" Allergan said.""We believe we may have existing data to answer FDA's questions,"" Allergan research and development chief Scott  Whitcup told analysts on a conference call on its pipeline of drugs in development. ""There is no scenario I can imagine under which we would not take this forward,"" Whitcup said.JPMorgan analyst Chris Schott called the Semprana delay a modest negative, but added in a research note: ""We expect the company to respond to the FDA by year end and now believe we could see an approval by the second quarter of 2015.""Allergan also announced plans to begin large Phase III trials of its closely watched Darpin treatment for wet age-related macular degeneration in the second quarter of 2015. The company has cited the future sales potential of Darpin and Valeant's lack of commitment to research and development as one of its arguments for remaining independent.""Valeant has neither the expertise nor the commitment to maximize the value of Darpin,"" Allergan said in its pipeline presentation on Monday.Data from a small Phase II trial appears to suggest that Darpin is at least as effective as Roche's Lucentis, with a longer duration of activity. Allergan said it believed Darpin could dry the retina more quickly and effectively than current treatments, possibly leading to superior vision improvement. The drug would also compete with Regeneron Pharmaceutical Inc's Eylea.Allergan said an improved manufacturing process could reduce incidence of ocular inflammation seen in earlier Darpin trials.But JPMorgan's Schott said: ""Today's update does not change our view that a potential combination with Valeant represents the path to greatest value creation for both companies.""Ozurdex, Allergan's sustained-release biodegradable steroid implant, received additional U.S. approval to treat diabetic macular edema (DME) in adult patients who have an artificial lens implant or are scheduled for cataract surgery.Allergan said it hoped to receive European DME approval in the second half of this year.The drug was previously approved to treat macular edema and non-infectious ocular inflammation.

163,"   By Caroline Humer and Deena Beasley | NEW YORK and LOS ANGELES  NEW YORK and LOS ANGELES Allergan Inc (AGN.N) may take on debt to buy back its own shares as part of a multi-faceted plan to thwart a $53 billion takeover bid by Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc (VRX.TO) (VRX.N) and activist investor William Ackman.The company is also considering making acquisitions of its own and more spending cuts to increase shareholder value, Chief Executive David Pyott said in an interview, outlining steps to build support for Allergan, best known for its Botox anti-wrinkle injections, to remain a standalone company. But Allergan, which is expected to unveil the plan when it releases second-quarter results sometime in July, faces an uphill battle. Valeant says it already has enough shareholders on its side to call a special meeting to replace Allergan board members with nominees who support its takeover proposal. To call a meeting, the acquisitive Canadian company needs support of the holders of at least 25 percent of the shares.It is possible that Allergan can turn the tide, but it won’t be easy, said Ronny Gal, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. ""When I run my numbers, a buyback alone doesn't quite cut it,” Gal said. “A buyback plus another round of costs cuts, or the acceleration of the discussed cost savings, does.""An Allergan acquisition could help as well if it increases the company's profits, Gal said. In order to get near-term investors on its side, Allergan needs to deliver another $10 per share of value in 2015 or $11 per share in 2016, he said. ""The question is, how big of a buyback and how big are the cost cuts?"" he said.      LEVERAGED BUYBACK Allergan announced an initial round of spending cuts in May when it first rejected Valeant’s offer. When it rejected Valeant's offer again on June 10, it said that it would unveil more cuts and capital measures when it releases its second-quarter results. In the interview,  Allergan CEO Pyott was more specific.  Pyott has met with investors to talk about the company’s defense, which he said could include issuing new debt to buy back shares. He said Allergan could borrow up to $10 billion without affecting its investment-grade rating, but he did not say how much the company might spend on the buybacks. ""Our goal now is to give them most of what they want,"" Pyott said, referring to Allergan shareholders. A leveraged buyback would increase the amount of Allergan's debt, making its balance sheet less attractive to a would-be acquirer. Allergan currently has little debt, one of the company features that appeals to debt-laden Valeant.A buyback would also reduce the number of shares outstanding, which would raise its earnings per share and increase shareholder value. An acquisition by Allergan could also increase earnings, he said.THE VALEANT PLAN  Valeant Chief Executive Michael Pearson said in an interview last week that he believes Valeant and Ackman, who owns nearly 10 percent of Allergan through Pershing Square Capital Management, have the backing of enough Allergan shareholders to support the deal.According to sources, Valeant and Ackman have won over a prominent hedge fund, Paulson & Co., which has bought more than 6 million Allergan shares. The company has said it will cut about $2.7 billion in spending at Allergan and that it would rely less on internal research and development in the future. Allergan says that such cuts would limit the company's growth potential.Valeant also might pay more to get a deal done, Pearson said. Valeant has already raised its offer twice but has held firm now for about a month. ""We have a walk away price for Allergan. I can’t tell you what our walk-away price is, but right now we don’t have any reason to raise because we would be bidding against ourselves,"" Pearson said. The offer, which includes $72 in cash plus 0.83 of a Valeant share, is currently worth about $177 per share, or $53 billion. The deal value is calculated based on 303.5 million diluted shares outstanding as of March 31, and Ackman’s holding of 28,878,638 shares.

The corporate battle has already been playing out in unusual ways.

The move is the latest twist in a heated battle between the two pharmaceutical companies and Ackman, one of the hedge fund industry's most closely watched investors.Allergan has steadfastly rebuffed Valeant's overtures, refusing to sell itself for $53 billion, while Ackman is working to call a special meeting of Allergan shareholders in order to elect new directors to the company's board. Credit Suisse traditionally has helped defend companies against activist investors like Ackman who often acquire a big stake in a company and then agitate for change. The corporate battle has already been playing out in unusual ways.Pershing Square and Valeant received a boost last week when influential hedge fund manager John Paulson's Paulson & Co bought more than 6 million shares of Allergan and threw its weight behind the proposed takeover.

167,"  (Adds TIMELINE link)By Caroline Humer and Deena BeasleyNEW YORK and LOS ANGELES, July 1 Allergan Inc  may take on debt to buy back its own shares as part of a multi-faceted plan to thwart a $53 billion takeover bid by Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc  and activist investor William Ackman.The company is also considering making acquisitions of its own and more spending cuts to increase shareholder value, Chief Executive David Pyott said in an interview, outlining steps to build support for Allergan, best known for its Botox anti-wrinkle injections, to remain a standalone company.But Allergan, which is expected to unveil the plan when it releases second-quarter results sometime in July, faces an uphill battle.Valeant says it already has enough shareholders on its side to call a special meeting to replace Allergan board members with nominees who support its takeover proposal. To call a meeting, the acquisitive Canadian company needs support of the holders of at least 25 percent of the shares.It is possible that Allergan can turn the tide, but it won't be easy, said Ronny Gal, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein.""When I run my numbers, a buyback alone doesn't quite cut it,"" Gal said. ""A buyback plus another round of costs cuts, or the acceleration of the discussed cost savings, does.""An Allergan acquisition could help as well if it increases the company's profits, Gal said. In order to get near-term investors on its side, Allergan needs to deliver another $10 per share of value in 2015 or $11 per share in 2016, he said. ""The question is, how big of a buyback and how big are the cost cuts?"" he said.LEVERAGED BUYBACK Allergan announced an initial round of spending cuts in May when it first rejected Valeant's offer. When it rejected Valeant's offer again on June 10, it said that it would unveil more cuts and capital measures when it releases its second-quarter results. In the interview,  Allergan CEO Pyott was more specific.  Pyott has met with investors to talk about the company's defense, which he said could include issuing new debt to buy back shares. He said Allergan could borrow up to $10 billion without affecting its investment-grade rating, but he did not say how much the company might spend on the buybacks.""Our goal now is to give them most of what they want,"" Pyott said, referring to Allergan shareholders.A leveraged buyback would increase the amount of Allergan's debt, making its balance sheet less attractive to a would-be acquirer. Allergan currently has little debt, one of the company features that appeals to debt-laden Valeant.A buyback would also reduce the number of shares outstanding, which would raise its earnings per share and increase shareholder value. An acquisition by Allergan could also increase earnings, he said. THE VALEANT PLAN Valeant Chief Executive Michael Pearson said in an interview last week that he believes Valeant and Ackman, who owns nearly 10 percent of Allergan through Pershing Square Capital Management, have the backing of enough Allergan shareholders to support the deal.According to sources, Valeant and Ackman have won over a prominent hedge fund, Paulson & Co., which has bought more than 6 million Allergan shares.The company has said it will cut about $2.7 billion in spending at Allergan and that it would rely less on internal research and development in the future. Allergan says that such cuts would limit the company's growth potential.Valeant also might pay more to get a deal done, Pearson said. Valeant has already raised its offer twice but has held firm now for about a month.""We have a walk away price for Allergan. I can't tell you what our walk-away price is, but right now we don't have any reason to raise because we would be bidding against ourselves,"" Pearson said.The offer, which includes $72 in cash plus 0.83 of a Valeant share, is currently worth about $177 per share, or $53 billion.

Paulson said Allergan's share price could rise to $222 a share based on the kind of savings Valeant's chief executive officer might make.Paulson called Mike Pearson, Valeant's CEO, a very cost-conscious executive who has added significant value for shareholders in the last years. ""He is a proven success,"" Paulson said. Valeant, working with activist investor William Ackman, has offered to pay $53 billion for the Botox maker but Allergan has steadfastly rejected any discussions with Valeant.The offer, which includes $72 in cash plus 0.83 Valeant shares, is worth about $177 per share. Ackman is mounting a proxy battle to try and force Allergan's board to discuss the Valeant bid and on Wednesday accused Allergan of violating its fiduciary duty for not negotiating with Valeant. Paulson said he would listen to a call on Thursday, hosted by Ackman, which will focus on Allergan's corporate governance and other aspects of its business. The call is scheduled for 8:30 a.m. EDT (1230 GMT) and will allow listeners to ask questions.Paulson said that Allergan could defend against Valeant's bid but would need to make an acquisition of its own to do so.

179,"   By Rod Nickel  Allergan Inc (AGN.N), trying to fend off a hostile takeover bid from Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc (VRX.TO), has thrown up obstacles to a special shareholders meeting, its biggest investor said on Thursday. Pershing Square Capital Management, which is led by Bill Ackman, is attempting to muster at least 25 percent support of Allergan shares to hold a special meeting that could replace most of the Botox anti-wrinkle injection maker's board, which has refused to negotiate with Valeant. In a webcast for investors, Ackman said Allergan's rules for special meetings were designed to stop them from occurring. The company limits special meetings to a small window during a given year and requires a high percentage of stockholders to call one, Ackman said. Shareholders must hold their stock through the date of the special meeting for them to count, he added.The rules are ""the most onerous special meeting provisions of any public company in the United States,"" Ackman said.Laval, Quebec-based Valeant made an unsolicited cash-and-stock bid in April for Allergan and has since raised its offer, which is currently worth about $51 billion.

Ackman said Pershing hoped to gather enough shareholder support by mid-August to call a special meeting, but probably needed as much as 40 percent for a ""big cushion"" to offset possible stock sales before the meeting occurs. He said the hedge fund met on Wednesday with shareholder advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services, which could make a recommendation on Valeant's offer in early August.Ackman estimated that a merged Valeant and Allergan would trade at $223 per share, slightly higher than the view of fellow activist investor John Paulson, who estimated $222 on Wednesday. Allergan shares were up 0.7 percent at $166.92 in afternoon trading in New York, while Valeant had tacked on nearly 4 percent at C$131.31 in Toronto. Valeant officials did not respond to a request for comment.Ackman used much of the nearly three-hour webcast to criticize Allergan's corporate governance and its business, including the approaching expiry of patents on some products and the return on its research and development spending.He also said the longer Allergan delays negotiating with Valeant, the greater the risk that a potential deal will fall apart due to a sudden change in equity or debt markets.

186,"   By Ransdell Pierson and Caroline Humer  Allergan Inc, which is fighting a hostile bid from Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc, said on Monday it would cut 13 percent of its workforce as part of a restructuring meant to boost profits over the next six years.The maker of anti-wrinkle drug Botox said the cost reductions, part of its efforts to convince investors that it is a better value as a stand-alone company, would help increase annual earnings more than 20 percent per year between 2014 and 2019.Valeant and Pershing Square Capital Management made a $52 billion hostile offer for the company in April, but Allergan says the deal would hurt its growth and is not in the best interest of shareholders. The 1,500 job cuts were more than the 5 percent to 10 percent that JPMorgan analyst Chris Schott expected, and he said Allergan therefore deserves a higher valuation.    The restructuring, which would create savings of $475 million in 2015, would also eliminate about 250 vacant positions.It would ensure earnings in 2016 of about $10 per share, excluding special items, well above Wall Street expectations of  $8.14 per share.""Valeant has been saying they’ll cut costs when they take over Allergan, and Allergan is now essentially saying, ‘We can reduce our own costs,’"" said Morningstar analyst Michael Waterhouse.     Allergan is weighing strategic options to counter Valeant, including stock buybacks and acquisitions.Allergan Chief Executive David Pyott, in a conference call with investors on Monday, said it would be difficult for Allergan to buy companies with the types of products it now sells - which include dermal fillers, breast implants and prescription eye drugs - because Allergan is already a dominant player in those markets.Allergan is interested, however, in buying one or more different types of businesses which would become ""new pillars"" of the company, Pyott said.  But activist shareholder Bill Ackman, who heads Pershing Capital, said on CNBC that such acquisitions by Allergan would be ""desperate"" moves and that Pershing Square would sue Allergan if such attempts were made.    Shares of Allergan rose 2.6 percent, while shares of Valeant rose 3.5 percent. David Maris, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets, said some investors may have bought Valiant shares to cover short positions. Allergan, which emphasizes research spending, said the restructuring would not reduce projects now in human trials.Valeant typically slashes research spending at companies it acquires, and it has vowed to do the same at Allergan.Separately on Monday, Valeant said it had complained to financial market regulators in Quebec and the United States about ""false and misleading statements"" that Allergan has made about its business.  The two sides are fighting for shareholders' votes even as those investors are buying and selling stakes. Hedge fund Paulson & Co bought more than 6 million shares of Allergan, sources told Reuters last month. On Monday, the Wall Street Journal reported that Capital Research and Management had sold off almost all of a stake that once exceeded 6 percent.Allergan expects earnings of $5.74 to $5.80 in 2014 and $8.20 to $8.40 in 2015. It had previously forecast a 2014 profit of $5.64 to $5.73 per share, with earnings growth of 20 percent to 25 percent in 2015.The company reported second-quarter earnings of $418 million, or $1.40 per share, compared with $361 million, or $1.22 per share, a year earlier.Excluding special items, Allergan earned $1.51 per share.

Fighters from Hamas, which controls Gaza, have repeatedly tried to infiltrate Israel over the past week through hidden tunnels.Fighting flared in the Ukrainian city of Donetsk as investigators began to inspect the bodies of victims of a Malaysia Airlines jet shot down last week. The United States and its allies have pointed the finger at pro-Russian rebels and at Moscow itself over the downing of the plane with 298 people aboard. Russia has denied involvement and blamed the Ukrainian military. The United States and the EU last week announced further economic sanctions against Russian interests before the jet was shot down, and sanctions could become even more stringent. However, the effect on the U.S. or the global economy continues to be seen as limited.The situations in Gaza and Ukraine ""are both quite serious, but at this point unlikely to derail the U.S. economy,"" said Rick Meckler, president of LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey.""Earnings have been good and there's the Fed's continued support. Investors are trying to balance out the support for the U.S. market with the risks the geopolitical tension brings.""

On Monday, it rose 10 percent but at 13.3 remains well below its historical average of 20.""When you have interest rates as low as they are it really dampens stock market volatility tremendously,"" Meckler said.

194,"   By Sarah N. Lynch | WASHINGTON, July 24  WASHINGTON, July 24 A U.S. lawmaker will pressure the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday to consider a raft of reforms, after William Ackman's aggressive efforts to take over Allergan Inc raised concerns about loose rules governing disclosure and shareholder voting.Republican Representative Edward Royce of California plans to grill SEC Corporation Finance Director Keith Higgins at a House Financial Services hearing.Among his top concerns is a rule that lets investors such as Ackman delay publicly reporting when they have amassed a large stake in a company for days.""I am especially interested in the SEC's process when looking at novel or creative deals like the announced joint-bid by Valeant Pharmaceuticals and Pershing Square for Allergan,"" Royce said in a statement.""Mr. Higgins' appearance before the committee is an opportunity to make sure that the Commission is making robust reviews of these sorts of deals to ensure strong investor protections and market transparency.""Saat Alety, Royce's spokesman, said that Royce is prepared to take legislative action if the SEC fails to fix the problem on its own. UNUSUAL TACTICS In recent months, Royce has been writing letters to the SEC to express concerns about some unusual maneuvers that Ackman's company Pershing Square Capital Management has used in its joint effort with Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc  to win a $53 billion hostile takeover of Allergan, which is headquartered near Royce's California district.In one May letter, Royce said he was concerned about early efforts by Ackman to call a non-binding shareholder vote outside of Allergan's typical election procedures as a way to pressure Allergan to negotiate a deal. Royce said he feared this ""shadow"" election would make it tough for shareholders to ""truly understand what is going on.""Pershing Square dropped plans for a shareholder referendum in May and has since pursued a more traditional proxy battle.In a July 2 letter to Royce, SEC Chair Mary Jo White said that the Corporation Finance division will ""continue to consider issues raised by the filing related to the abandoned shareholder referendum"" and ""issues raised by any future filings of a similar nature.""Ackman's tactics have raised a number of regulatory questions, both about his actions and about hostile takeover bids generally. It has renewed calls to fix a SEC rule that affords large investors a 10-day delay before they must report when they have amassed more than a 5 percent stake in a company.The 2010 Dodd-Frank law authorized the SEC to shorten the reporting period, but so far the SEC has not taken up the measure.Higgins' division is in charge of reviewing financial statements of public companies and corporate governance matters.In that role, his division would oversee a rule-writing on the reporting period and also review proxy filings and related regulatory matters.Royce's questions on Thursday will touch on just one of what is expected to be a wide-ranging list of topics at the hearing.Lawmakers also plan to ask Higgins about other matters, from rulemakings required by the Dodd Frank and JOBS Act laws, to how the SEC oversees proxy advisory firms.

197,"  (Adds CEO, analyst comments, sales of Bausch & Lomb brands)By Ransdell PiersonJuly 31 Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc, embroiled in a bitter battle to take over Botox-maker Allergan Inc, reported disappointing quarterly earnings and cut its 2014 and 2015 profit forecasts on Thursday, sending its shares down 7.2 percent.""People were disappointed in Valeant's outlook for the remainder of 2014, and especially its 2015 earnings guidance, which is about $1 per share below expectations,"" said Raghuram Selvaraju, an analyst with Aegis Capital.The Laval, Quebec-based company teamed up with activist investor Bill Ackman on April 21 to make a cash and stock offer for Allergan now worth about $50 billion. Allergan says the deal would hurt its growth and compromise shareholders.Even as it lowered its profit forecasts, Valeant argued that second quarter results should bolster its attractiveness to Allergan shareholders. Valeant, which paid $8.7 billion for eye care company Bausch & Lomb last year, said sales of those products rose 12 percent to $891 million in the quarter.""They'll use that to argue that the Allergan business won't go to pot if acquired by Valeant,"" Selvaraju said.Allergan has questioned Valeant's marketing ability and said it believed the Bausch & Lomb products were stagnating. Valeant, which has grown swiftly through acquisitions, now expects 2014 profit, excluding special items, of $7.90-$8.10 per share, on revenue of $8 billion to $8.3 billion. That is down from its forecast in April of $8.55 to $8.80 per share on revenue of $8.3 billion to $8.7 billion.Valeant said it lowered its 2014 forecasts to reflect its recent sale of rights to several skin care products.For next year, it forecast earnings of about $9.65 per share, well below the Thomson Reuters forecast of $10.42. It expects revenue of about $9.3 billion next year, rising to $11.4 billion in 2016. For 2016, it expects earnings of $12.30 per share. The outlooks assume acquisitions of about $5 billion in 2015 and $10 billion in 2016, Valeant executives said in a conference call with investors. The forecasts represent ""conservative assumptions,"" including stable research spending and the negative impact of patent expirations, said Chief Financial Officer Howard Schiller.Valeant said it remains intent on acquiring Allergan and that Allergan shareholders, should the merger go through, would get twice the earnings per share in 2016 than they would receive if Allergan remained independent.Chief Executive Michael Pearson said Valeant is also interested in other acquisitions, including innovative contact lenses. He said the company could not be content to remain the No. 4 global player in the field.Valeant said it earned $126 million, or 37 cents per share, in the second quarter, from $10.8 million, or 3 cents per share, a year earlier.Excluding special items, Valeant earned $1.91 per share, below the Thomson Reuters forecast of $1.96.

200,"   By Svea Herbst-Bayliss and Caroline Humer  Botox maker Allergan Inc (AGN.N) on Friday accused rival Valeant Pharmaceuticals International (VRX.TO) and billionaire investor William Ackman of violating securities laws by using insider information as they prepared a takeover bid for the drug company.In a civil lawsuit filed in federal court in California, Allergan said Ackman's Pershing Square Capital Management and Valeant ""hatched"" an ""improper and illicit insider-trading scheme"" that allowed the hedge fund to buy Allergan shares, knowing about Valeant's planned $51 billion takeover bid.Valeant and Pershing Square said the complaint was intended to prevent them from calling a special meeting of Allergan shareholders to vote on their board nominees. ""This is a shameless attempt by Allergan to delay the shareholders' fundamental right to call a special meeting,"" Ackman said in a statement. ""Allergan's determination to waste money on a baseless lawsuit against its largest shareholder further demonstrates why this board of directors should be removed.""Without a shareholder meeting, Pershing Square and Valeant may not have the support they need to remove Allergan's ""poison pill"" measure or to ensure the success of a tender offer.The lawsuit marks the latest twist in an increasingly hostile battle between the two drugmakers and one of the world's most prominent activist investors. Allergan has been fighting the takeover bid since it was announced on April 22.    From the beginning, outside lawyers said the structure of the Ackman partnership with Valeant was novel but not illegal. Now some experts say the suit could allow Allergan to seek fresh evidence to press its case and make life tougher for the $15 billion hedge fund. The timing for Ackman's Pershing Square is also inopportune as it works to list one of its funds on an exchange in Europe. ""This lawsuit brings a set of plausible but difficult complaints that Ackman's lawyers will likely not be able to get dismissed right away,"" said Erik Gordon, a professor of law and business at the University of Michigan. ""Defending against this suit is going to cost money and time and be unpleasant for Ackman,"" he said. ""It may give Allergan discovery rights to dig in and see if there is more evidence.""The value of Pershing Square's 9.7 percent stake in Allergan, built up between February and April, jumped $1.2 billion once the takeover bid became public. Allergan said the hedge fund improperly enriched itself at the expense of shareholders.Insider trading cases typically turn on whether a breach of duty or trust to the source of information has occurred. In this case, the insider trading allegations focus on Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, regulations surrounding the dissemination of information related to tender offers. ""There is a technical SEC rule, Rule 14e-3, that prohibits the use of material tender offer information, unless you are the offering person,"" Alan Palmiter, a law professor at Wake Forest University, in Winston-Salem, North Carolina said.""There could be a plausible argument that Ackman may have violated this rule even if he bought Allergan shares with Valeant's permission, because the rule does not require a breach of a duty of trust or confidence.""DELAY IN SHAREHOLDER MEETING  Allergan's gains helped Pershing Square produce some of the hedge fund industry's strongest performance numbers so far this year, investors said.Allergan asked the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California to rescind Pershing Square's purchase of the Allergan shares, arguing they were illegally acquired.  The lawsuit said heavily indebted Valeant lacked the resources to buy Allergan, so it sought financing from Ackman and Pershing Square. By the time they reached a financing agreement, Valeant had already taken concrete steps toward a tender offer for Allergan, it added.For Ackman, who invests for institutional investors including state pension funds as well as wealthy individuals, the lawsuit comes at a critical time as he presses forward with an activist campaign against Herbalife (HLF.N) and works to attract investors to the new Pershing Square fund planned for Europe.

204,"  (The opinions expressed here are those of Alison Frankel, a columnist for Reuters.)By Alison FrankelNEW YORK Aug 4 A few days after the Canadian pharmaceutical company Valeant announced that it had teamed up with the activist investor William Ackman to bid for Botox maker Allergan, Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz wrote a teeth-gnashing client alert about the new threat to corporate targets from the unholy alliance of a strategic bidder with an activist hedge fund.Commentators were already raising questions about whether Ackman and Valeant had engaged in insider trading, because Ackman secretly accumulated Allergan shares based on his knowledge of Valeant's imminent takeover bid. But in that early memo, Wachtell didn't claim Valeant and Ackman had broken insider trading rules. Instead, the firm bemoaned Valeant and Ackman's ""conspicuously structured"" stratagem that ""took express pains to sidestep"" the Williams Act's bar on trading in advance of a tender offer.Unfortunately for Allergan and future target companies, Wachtell said, ""The structure is crafty, and good for Valeant and Pershing Square (as long as no bad facts emerge, such as undisclosed arrangements, that could get them in trouble).""A prophetic parenthetical? On Friday, Wachtell - now acting as counsel to Allergan, along with Latham & Watkins - filed a complaint in federal court in Los Angeles that accuses Valeant and Ackman of executing an ""improper and illicit insider-trading scheme ... flouting key provisions of the federal securities laws.""The suit not only claims that Valeant and Ackman didn't make adequate disclosures to Allergan shareholders - reviving an old takeover defense tactic from the 1980s - but also pushes the novel theory that Ackman violated a provision of the Williams Act prohibiting anyone except an acquirer from trading on material non-public knowledge that the acquirer has taken ""a substantial step"" toward launching a tender offer. CASHING IN Ackman, according to the complaint, violated both pieces of the provision. First, he isn't really the strategic co-acquirer he and Valeant have purported him to be in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, according to Allergan. The target's suit portrays Ackman as a money man who saw the co-bidder arrangement as an opportunity to realize quick gains from Valeant's takeover bid, but who may later walk away if his interests diverge from Valeant's.And both Valeant and Ackman, according to Allergan, have long known that Valeant's unsolicited takeover bid for Allergan would end up as a hostile tender offer, not least because Allergan rebuffed advances from Valeant back in 2012. According to the complaint, Ackman has done precisely what the Williams Act provision prohibits, cashing in on inside knowledge that someone else is planning a tender offer.That's obviously quite a different read than Wachtell had in April, when it begrudgingly acknowledged the ""crafty"" structure Valeant and Ackman had devised to get around the Williams Act. So what do Allergan and Wachtell know now that they didn't know then? Not much, by my read of the complaint. When Pershing surfaced with a 4.9 percent stake in Allergan in late April, Ackman's filing at the Securities and Exchange Commission attached the Feb. 25 agreement that established his partnership with Valeant and reported the specific trades in which their joint acquisition vehicle, PS Fund 1, acquired Allergan shares. The Ackman filing also noted that Pershing and Valeant had first executed a confidentiality agreement in February, though neither that agreement nor an amended version of it was disclosed to the SEC.A TOUGH SELL Allergan's complaint contends that Ackman's failure to reveal those confidentiality agreements was a violation of disclosure provisions of federal securities laws. The suit also implies that there may be something in those undisclosed agreements, which aren't attached as exhibits to the complaint, that would expose the sham of the co-bidder structure. Otherwise, the complaint's allegations about the supposedly sham facade of partnership between Valeant and Ackman are based on information Allergan already had in April or more recent evidence that seems pretty trivial.That evidence includes a statement Ackman made in a July interview with CNBC, when he said Valeant had sole control over what it would pay for Allergan; and Valeant's initial failure to name Pershing as a co-bidder when it first notified the SEC that it was commencing a tender offer for Allergan on June 18. Pershing was ""belatedly"" added in a July 23 amendment, according to the Allergan complaint.Are those new developments enough to discredit the co-bidder acquisition structure designed to permit Ackman and Valeant to get around the Williams Act? (I'm not even going to get into the specifics of Allergan's claims that Valeant and Ackman violated the second prong of the insider trading clause because Valeant took steps beginning in February to launch a tender offer.)Seems like a tough sell to me, based on what's in the complaint. Valeant, Ackman and their lawyers - Sullivan & Cromwell and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom for Valeant; Kirkland & Ellis for Pershing and Ackman - deliberately crafted a deal structure to avoid the insider trading bar, as even Wachtell acknowledged in that client alert back in April. Wachtell didn't suggest the deal was illegal then, and I didn't see much new evidence in Friday's complaint to indicate that it is now.Valeant and Pershing, meanwhile, claim that the true purpose of Allergan's suit is to avert a special meeting of Allergan shareholders, which the bidders are trying to convene in connection with the tender offer.As Allergan explained in a letter to Chancellor Andre Bouchard of Delaware Chancery Court filed Friday along with its suit against Valeant and Pershing, under Allergan bylaws, shareholders can't convene a special meeting if they've violated disclosure laws. Allergan's letter suggests that it sued Valeant and Pershing to tee up future Delaware Chancery arguments that they can't convene a shareholder meeting because of their alleged disclosure failures.On the other hand, Allergan didn't also have to throw down insider trading allegations if it just wanted to block the shareholder meeting. Allergan didn't get any discovery from Valeant and Pershing in its short-lived and recently settled litigation over Allergan's poison pill. But maybe some of those ""bad facts"" and ""undisclosed arrangements"" Wachtell speculated about in April will turn up in the new case. Allergan seems to be counting on it.

205,"  (Adds details from letter, background to request)By Svea Herbst-BaylissAug 4 Proxy advisory firm Glass Lewis on Monday suggested that Allergan Inc shareholders join hedge fund manager William Ackman in calling for a special shareholder meeting.In a report issued to clients, the firm said that shareholders should fill out the paperwork required by Botox maker Allergan for anyone who would like to call for a special shareholder meeting.""We are inclined to suggest shareholders would be best served setting aside the aforementioned risks in favor of the Pershing Square Written Request effort,"" Glass Lewis said.Ackman, working with Valeant Pharmaceuticals Inc, has tried for months to broker a deal where Valeant would buy Allergan for $51 billion, but so far Allergan has steadfastly refused. As a next step, Ackman whose $15 billion Pershing Square Capital Management owns 9.7 percent of Allergan, has laid the groundwork to call for a special meeting where he hopes to replace the majority of the board with new directors who will be more receptive to the takeover bid.The report could be seen as a win for Ackman in the increasingly bitter battle for Botox maker Allergan's future. Allergan requires a shareholder to have the support of 25 percent of all shares in order to call a special meeting and its bylaws require the shareholders who want to make such a request to do it in writing.Glass Lewis took care to note that shareholders would not explicitly throw their weight behind a takeover by participating in the process to let a special meeting be called.""We note the current process - as presently framed - does not represent a vote on the merits of any prospective combination transaction or any change to the sitting board; rather investors would only be participating in a process intended to afford them the opportunity to directly express their opinions - positive or negative - on those issues,"" Glass Lewis wrote in its nine-page report seen by Reuters. ""Thus, viewed collectively, we believe the foregoing factors serve as adequate cause for shareholders to participate in Pershing Square's Written Request solicitation,"" the report said.Proxy advisory firms' opinions often help shape shareholder views on certain actions. Large investors, including mutual funds, are looking for guidance on how to act in this bitter corporate fight.Institutional Shareholder Services, another proxy advisory firm, is expected to issue its report in the next few days.The opinion comes only a few days after Allergan sued Ackman and Valeant accusing them of have broken insider trading regulations by having worked out the possible details for a takeover bid as the $15 billion hedge fund was building its stake in Allergan.

206,"  Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) is backing activist investor Bill Ackman's call for a special meeting of Allergan Inc (AGN.N) investors that could topple the company's board and increase the chances of a takeover by Valeant Pharmaceuticals International (VRX.TO).ISS' recommendation on Wednesday follows a similar view from shareholder advisory firm Glass Lewis on Monday, giving Ackman's Pershing Square Capital Management momentum as the hedge fund tries to muster support for the meeting. ISS is the largest proxy adviser for institutional investors.Pershing, Allergan's biggest investor with a 9.7 percent stake, needs to garner shareholder support representing 25 percent of the California company, best known for its Botox anti-wrinkle injections.

218,"  U.S. securities regulators are looking at the hostile takeover bid made by billionaire investor William Ackman and Valeant Pharmaceuticals for Botox maker Allergan Inc, a person familiar with the matter said on Thursday.The Securities and Exchange Commission, which regularly reviews planned takeover deals, is asking Ackman's hedge fund, Pershing Square Capital Management, questions about the deal and the hedge fund is answering them, the person said.Pershing Square, which owns nearly 10 percent of Allergan, worked with Valeant to put together the takeover deal, which was  first unveiled in April. Allergan is fighting the hostile bid.Valeant has since launched a tender offer for the company's shares.The Wall Street Journal first reported on Thursday that the SEC was looking into whether the hostile offer by Valeant and Ackman violated securities laws. Pershing Square said in a statement that it had done nothing wrong when it acquired shares of Allergan, made an offer on April 22 that was rejected and then launched a tender offer on June 18. ""There is nothing illegal, unethical or improper in taking a toehold position before a merger is proposed, even if it is not wanted by the target’s management. We welcome the SEC’s review of the facts,"" Pershing Square said.Earlier this month, Allergan accused Valeant and Ackman of violating securities laws by using insider information as they prepared their takeover bid.

219,"  (Adds Pershing Square comments, Allergan no comment)Aug 14 U.S. securities regulators are looking at the hostile takeover bid made by billionaire investor William Ackman and Valeant Pharmaceuticals for Botox maker Allergan Inc, a person familiar with the matter said on Thursday.The Securities and Exchange Commission, which regularly reviews planned takeover deals, is asking Ackman's hedge fund, Pershing Square Capital Management, questions about the deal and the hedge fund is answering them, the person said.Pershing Square, which owns nearly 10 percent of Allergan, worked with Valeant to put together the takeover deal, which was  first unveiled in April. Allergan is fighting the hostile bid.Valeant has since launched a tender offer for the company's shares. The Wall Street Journal first reported on Thursday that the SEC was looking into whether the hostile offer by Valeant and Ackman violated securities laws.Pershing Square said in a statement that it had done nothing wrong when it acquired shares of Allergan, made an offer on April 22 that was rejected and then launched a tender offer on June 18. ""There is nothing illegal, unethical or improper in taking a toehold position before a merger is proposed, even if it is not wanted by the target's management. We welcome the SEC's review of the facts,"" Pershing Square said.Earlier this month, Allergan accused Valeant and Ackman of violating securities laws by using insider information as they prepared their takeover bid.

And while the data, released in so-called 13-F filings, is backward looking and could have changed in the 45 days since the end of the quarter, investors say that it gives at least a strong flavor for what savvy investors are thinking.Ackman's Pershing Square Capital Management disclosed a 9.7 percent stake in Allergan at the time. By the end of June, John Paulson's Paulson & Co, Jamie Dinan's York Capital Management and Andreas Halvorsen's Viking Global Investors had also bought in, according to the documents released by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.The filings show that several large mutual fund firms that already owned Allergan made even bigger bets during the quarter. T. Rowe Price, for example, more than doubled its position, although it did not say exactly which funds owned the shares.Paulson's moves have been tracked closely by investors since his winning bet against the overheated U.S. housing market. He has publicly supported Valeant's bid for Allergan, now worth about $49 billion. But many other shareholders have been silent and it was not clear who else had gotten in or gotten out. In the last weeks, the fight for Allergan has become even more bitter. Proxy advisory firms are urging its shareholders to support Ackman's call for a special meeting to consider a deal.Yet one of Valeant's top shareholders, hedge fund ValueAct Capital Management, suggested that Valeant may not be able to afford a drawn-out, damaging fight.Allergan charged in a lawsuit filed earlier this month in California that Pershing Square broke insider trading laws when setting up its partnership with Valeant. Now U.S. securities regulators are asking questions about the planned takeover, a person familiar with the matter said on Thursday. Thursday's filings show that York Capital Management bought 2.4 million shares of Allergan during the quarter. York also bought put options on Allergan. Eric Mindich's Eton Park Capital Management said it owned 901,000 shares while Viking Global Investors reported owning 803,369 shares. Viking also raised its bet on Valeant by buying an additional 2.5 million shares.Other new owners include Farallon Capital Management, founded by Tom Steyer and now run by Andrew Spokes, which said it owned 612,500 shares. Hoplite Capital Management also opened a new position and owned 625,850 shares.Sachem Head Capital, run by Scott Ferguson who left Ackman's firm in 2012 to open his own shop, also bought in, opening a new position with 490,000 shares. Ferguson also opened a new position in Valeant with 419,500 shares. Investors who exited or cut their positions include Capital Research Global Investors, which ranked as Allergan's second-largest shareholder at the end of the first quarter but sold out its holdings during the second quarter. Hedge fund Jennison Associates cuts its position by more than half, selling 6.2 million shares while Montag & Caldwell sold 1.3 million shares, cutting its stake by 36 percent.The decision to buy in at that time paid off big as Allergan's stock price surged 38 percent in the second quarter.Since then the share price has come under some pressure. The spread on the deal - or the difference between the value of the two companies' shares and the ratio implied by the deal's terms - has widened slightly to about 5.2 percent from less than 3 percent earlier this week after a key Valeant shareholder questioned the deal's logic.Some investors have said that Allergan's share price suggests the deal may have less of a chance of getting done now.

223,"  Aug 18 Botox-maker Allergan Inc, which is trying to fight off a hostile takeover bid from Valeant Pharmaceuticals Inc , said its chief financial officer, Jeff Edwards, was stepping down for family reasons and would be replaced immediately by 30-year company veteran Jim Hindman.Allergan on Monday said Edwards, who has been CFO for nine of his 21 years with the company, had informed it in February of his interest in giving up his post later in 2014 in order to commit more time to his family. He will remain with Allergan in a nonexecutive capacity, as Hindman transitions into the job. Since 2002, Hindman has served as senior vice president of Treasury, Risk and Investor Relations, after serving as controller and in other financial roles with the Irvine, California-based company. Chief Executive Officer David Pyott said in a news release that Hindman had played an especially important leadership role in recent months. But Pyott did not mention Valeant, which on April 22 teamed up with billionaire investor William Ackman to make an unsolicited $47 billion bid for Allergan. After twice boosting their bid, and adjusting for the declining value in recent months of Valeant shares, the bid is now valued at $48 billion.

Now some Valeant shareholders who backed the deal at its start are questioning whether it will become reality.A robust defense from California-based Allergan and Valeant's own weak second quarter financial performance have pressured Valeant stock, which is down 6 percent this year after doubling in 2013. Ackman, whose hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management owns nearly 10 percent of Allergan, is digging in and told his own investors he is focused on getting a deal done. Valeant also remains committed.Allergan's resistance -- the company has rejected Valeant's overtures and instead been looking for a partner while also trying to cut costs -- is an unexpected twist for Valeant, whose steady stream of drug industry acquisitions under Chief Executive Michael Pearson drew frequent investor praise.Valeant's novel strategy to team up with Ackman and his hedge fund, also was lauded. One of Valeant's top shareholders, ValueAct Capital, called Valeant and Allergan a ""perfect match"" when the plan was announced in late April.Now the value of Valeant's cash and stock-based offer has fallen $5 billion to $48 billion.ValueAct is the first large shareholder to have expressed concerns about the deal publicly, telling Reuters last week that Canada-based Valeant doesn't need to buy Allergan and that it may do better by considering other acquisition targets if the battle drags out.In Reuters interviews since then, five other large Valeant shareholders, most of whom support the deal, said that there were mounting doubts, ranging from concern a transaction wouldn't happen to worries that the pursuit of Allergan would drag out so long as to undermine the benefits.""The dive in the stock price does make it difficult to pursue Allergan and others,"" said Valeant investor Gautam Dhingra, CEO of High Pointe Capital Management, which owned 18,600 shares as of June 30. Dhingra said he still believes in Valeant's business model of acquiring companies and cutting research & development costs, although people are starting to challenge it. ""Until now there has been no flaw in the model, nobody has questioned it,"" he said.Another investor at a Canadian investment fund said that six months or a year of pursuing Allergan would not be too long, but that by early next year, he would like the deal to be moving forward. ""If the opportunity cost is too much over time, we think there are other things that Valeant can do.""During the second quarter 57 fund firms exited Valeant stock completely and 148 funds cut their positions, according to data from the Securities and Exchange Commission.Mutual fund giant Fidelity Investments cut its Valeant holdings by 38 percent while a number of hedge funds including Robert Citrone's Discovery Capital Management and Daniel Loeb's Third Point LLC as well as Adage Capital Management, sold out completely, according to the filings.""The share price had gone up a lot and when things started to look a little more difficult, many investors were not ready to stick around and wait for that little extra percent they might make if and when the deal is consummated,"" one shareholder at a New York hedge fund said. Erik Gordon, a professor of law and business at the University of Michigan, said that in April he saw a ""transformational deal"" between an activist investor and a company that wanted to buy another company. ""Now with all of these complications cropping up, I'm not sure anymore,"" he said.Still, 81 funds opened new positions and 191 added to their Valeant holdings in the quarter. Steven A. Cohen's family office Point72 Asset Management, the successor to hedge fund titan SAC Capital Advisors, added a new position as did Eminence Capital and Senator Investment Group, the filings show.Ackman and Valeant both stressed their commitment to completing a deal. The partners are working to gather the support of owners of 25 percent of Allergan stock, the level needed to call a special meeting. Ackman holds 9.7 percent.Proxy advisory firms have suggested investors vote for the meeting, at which Ackman and Valeant want to replace the bulk of Allergan's directors. They also want Allergan shareholders to vote for opening discussions on a deal. There is no vote on a deal yet, making it premature for proxy firms to issue any opinions. UNWELCOME SCRUTINY Allergan has been fighting hard to keep Valeant at bay, from suing its pursuer to looking for its own potential acquisitions, which would complicate a Valeant deal.Ackman and Valeant began working together in February.Ackman used a corporate entity, funded by the hedge fund and Valeant, to amass an Allergan stake. Pershing Square in turn booked about $1 billion in profit as Allergan shares shot up on the deal announcement.Allergan said the arrangement between Ackman and Valeant violated insider trading rules and sued. Valeant and Ackman deny those claims, with Ackman calling the lawsuit a tactic to delay a special shareholder meeting.The Securities and Exchange Commission is asking questions about the proposed deal, a source familiar with the matter said last week, and Valeant disclosed earlier this month a new Internal Revenue Service audit of the its U.S. consolidated group for its 2011 and 2012 tax years.A Valeant spokeswoman said that the company remains committed to both the deal and its promises of growth, and that it was confident in the legality of its actions with Ackman.""Valeant also has a rich pipeline of other business development opportunities, and we are confident that we will continue to deliver strong results and grow in the high single digits,"" Valeant spokeswoman Laurie Little said in an emailed statement.

""Now with all of these complications cropping up, I'm not sure anymore,"" he said.  Still, 81 funds opened new positions and 191 added to their Valeant holdings in the quarter. Steven A. Cohen’s family office Point72 Asset Management, the successor to hedge fund titan SAC Capital Advisors, added a new position as did Eminence Capital and Senator Investment Group, the filings show. Ackman and Valeant both stressed their commitment to completing a deal. The partners are working to gather the support of owners of 25 percent of Allergan stock, the level needed to call a special meeting. Ackman holds 9.7 percent. Proxy advisory firms have suggested investors vote for the meeting, at which Ackman and Valeant want to replace the bulk of Allergan's directors. They also want Allergan shareholders to vote for opening discussions on a deal. There is no vote on a deal yet, making it premature for proxy firms to issue any opinions. UNWELCOME SCRUTINY  Allergan has been fighting hard to keep Valeant at bay, from suing its pursuer to looking for its own potential acquisitions, which would complicate a Valeant deal.Ackman and Valeant began working together in February. Ackman used a corporate entity, funded by the hedge fund and Valeant, to amass an Allergan stake. Pershing Square in turn booked about $1 billion in profit as Allergan shares shot up on the deal announcement.Allergan said the arrangement between Ackman and Valeant violated insider trading rules and sued. Valeant and Ackman deny those claims, with Ackman calling the lawsuit a tactic to delay a special shareholder meeting.The Securities and Exchange Commission is asking questions about the proposed deal, a source familiar with the matter said last week, and Valeant disclosed earlier this month a new Internal Revenue Service audit of the its U.S. consolidated group for its 2011 and 2012 tax years.A Valeant spokeswoman said that the company remains committed to both the deal and its promises of growth, and that it was confident in the legality of its actions with Ackman.""Valeant also has a rich pipeline of other business development opportunities, and we are confident that we will continue to deliver strong results and grow in the high single digits,"" Valeant spokeswoman Laurie Little said in an emailed statement.

That start date is in line with their request for the court to order Allergan - after the trial ends - to call a special meeting by mid-November.That is about a month earlier than the Dec. 18 date Allergan has said it will hold the meeting at which Ackman and Valeant hope to elect new board members and open discussions on a deal. The court order comes after Ackman's Pershing Square Capital Management hedge fund and Canada's Valeant sued the maker of Botox anti-wrinkle treatment on Friday, saying the company did not intend to call a meeting at all. Allergan subsequently set the meeting date.In the lawsuit, Pershing Square, Allergan's biggest shareholder, alleged that Allergan was trying to avoid a special meeting to give it time to find an alternative deal.In setting the expedited trial date, Bouchard said it was pretty apparent to him that ""Allergan may not want a special meeting at all."" Since Valeant and Pershing Square offered to buy Allergan on April 22, Allergan has consistently rejected the offer, saying it undervalues the company. It has also announced a series of cost cuts and said it was looking for acquisitions as it seeks to persuade shareholders they are better off if it stands alone.Allergan's lawyer told Bouchard on Wednesday that it needed time to avoid a ""bum rush"" by Pershing Square and to determine if Pershing Square had violated federal securities laws in obtaining its 9.7 percent stake. Allergan said in a statement that it believes Pershing Square and Valeant are trying to hastily schedule the meeting to facilitate Valeant's ""grossly"" inadequate offer and to mask its operating performance.Ackman began accumulating his stake in February when he and Valeant started talking about buying Allergan together. He disclosed his stake on April 21, and the companies announced the offer on April 22, which instantly pushed Allergan shares higher and created $1 billion in paper gains for Ackman.Allergan has sued both Ackman and Valeant for insider trading in federal court in California, saying that aspects of their unusual arrangement violated securities regulations.Valeant shares fell $1.03, or less than 1 percent, to $116.07 and Allergan was down $1.92, or 1.2 percent, at $162.06.

248,"   By Dan Levine | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO A U.S. appeals court on Tuesday revived a 2010 shareholder lawsuit against Allergan Inc over allegations the company improperly marketed and labeled the cosmetic drug Botox.The ruling, from the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco, said plaintiff shareholders had alleged enough specific facts to proceed. Allergan, which paid a $375 million criminal fine after being accused of marketing Botox for off-label uses, said the allegations in the shareholder derivative lawsuit have not been proved and the company is confident it will be vindicated. The lawsuit, filed in 2010, alleged that Allergan's board authorized plans to promote Botox for off-label conditions like headaches and migraines despite knowing the limits of federal drug marketing rules.  A lower court judge in Santa Ana, California dismissed it, saying the shareholders had not followed proper procedure by first requesting that Allergan's board file legal claims in the company's own name. The 9th Circuit on Tuesday disagreed, saying the shareholders alleged enough specifics to raise doubts as to whether the board faces liability, and as a result do not have to approach the board before heading to court. The case in the 9th Circuit is Rosenbloom vs. Pyott, 12-55516.

But crossing the 35 percent mark would mark an important step because Allergan is trying to prevent Ackman from voting his nearly 10 percent stake, alleging that the investor improperly built up his holding as he prepared to make a bid with Valeant.Even in the unlikely event Ackman's votes are not counted, having 35 percent of investor consent would satisfy Allergan's by-laws that at least one quarter of its shareholders request a special meeting.Pershing Square expects to deliver requests from additional shareholders for a special meeting as soon as Thursday, putting the number at 35 percent, one of the people added. All the people asked not to be named because the matter is not public. Representatives for Pershing Square declined to comment and Valeant could not be immediately reached for comment.Since Valeant and Pershing Square offered to buy Allergan on April 22, Allergan has consistently rejected the offer, saying it undervalues the company. It has also announced a series of cost cuts and said it was looking for acquisitions as it seeks to persuade shareholders they are better off if it stands alone.Allergan set a Dec. 18 date for a special meeting following shareholder requests but Ackman wants to expedite it to mid-November, saying that Allergan is trying to give itself time to find an alternative deal.Allergan Chief Executive David Pyott has said that he is looking at the potential of making a big acquisition, making the company a subject of frenzied merger speculation in recent weeks involving several companies including Salix Pharmaceuticals Ltd SLXP.O and Jazz Pharmaceuticals Plc (JAZZ.O). But Allergan has also said that it would give shareholders a fair chance to weigh Valeant and Pershing's takeover proposal. ""While Allergan does not believe that Valeant's offer provides compelling value relative to the alternatives available to the company, the board fully supports the right of stockholders to vote on the value proposition offered by Valeant at the appropriate time,"" Allergan said on Aug. 22.Ackman began accumulating his stake in February when he and Valeant started talking about buying Allergan together. He disclosed his stake on April 21, and the companies announced the offer on April 22, which instantly pushed Allergan shares higher and created $1 billion in paper gains for Ackman. Allergan has sued both Ackman and Valeant for insider trading in federal court in California, saying that aspects of their unusual arrangement violated securities regulations. The two deny the allegations.As part of the insider trading suit, Allergan is seeking a preliminary injunction to disqualify Ackman's stake from counting toward the 25 percent needed to call a special meeting of shareholders, as well as the 50 percent needed to replace the board at the special meeting.Ackman is seeking to oust the majority of Allergan's board and change the company's by-laws in order to pave the way for a takeover by Valeant and Pershing Square.A judge declined to expedite Allergan’s insider trading case against Valeant, which may have delayed the special meeting.

Pershing Square has been working with Canada's Valeant to pursue a hostile takeover bid for Allergan, but the Botox maker has refused and has instead tried to line up another partner.To force the company to the table, Ackman has been pushing for a special meeting where he hopes to replace most company directors with his own nominees who he expects will be more receptive to Valeant's bid..Allergan on Thursday brushed aside the development and said while Valeant and Pershing Square are trying to ""change the subject,"" it is trying to deliver a compounded annual growth rate of more than 20 percent EPS growth.Crossing the 35 percent mark however signals an important step because Allergan is suing to prevent Pershing Square from voting its nearly 10 percent stake, alleging that the firm improperly built the holding as Ackman was hammering out a takeover bid with Valeant. Even in the unlikely event Ackman's votes are not counted, having 35 percent of investor consent would satisfy Allergan's by-laws that at least one quarter of its shareholders request a special meeting.""The delivery of additional requests for the Special Meeting by Pershing Square is not a meaningful development"" because the meeting date is already set, Allergan said in the statement.Pershing Square could not be reached for comment and Valeant was also not immediately available to comment.

266,"  (The opinions expressed here are those of Alison Frankel, a columnist for Reuters.)By Alison FrankelNEW YORK Allergan's attempt to ward off a precedent-setting joint bid by the Canadian pharmaceutical company Valeant and the hedge fund Pershing Square continues to remake the rulebook for hostile takeovers.On Monday, U.S. District Judge David Carter of Santa Ana, Calif., ordered Allergan to turn over to lawyers for Valeant and Pershing the complete records of recent board meetings and other strategic documents despite Allergan's arguments that the documents would expose its plans for fending off the hostile bidders.The ruling came in Allergan's suit accusing Pershing of acquiring its shares based on insider information about Valeant's plan to acquire Allergan. Allergan is seeking to enjoin Pershing from voting its nearly 10 percent stake at a special meeting of Allergan shareholders scheduled to take place on Dec. 18.The company's lawyers at Latham & Watkins had argued that Allergan is entitled to shield sensitive information under a ""business strategy privilege"" that dates back to takeover defense litigation from the 1980s and 1990s. ""This case is about one question: whether defendants violated federal insider trading and disclosure laws in connection with Valeant's proposed hostile attempt to take over Allergan,"" Allergan wrote in a brief. ""Defendants nevertheless seek to compel Allergan to produce some of the most competitively sensitive information in its possession - information that has nothing to do with those claims and that if disclosed to defendants (one of whom is Allergan's direct competitor), would substantially harm Allergan and its stockholders by impairing Allergan's ability to attract strategic transaction partners and negotiate effectively with them.""Pershing and Valeant (represented by Kirkland & Ellis and Sullivan & Cromwell) said Allergan had concocted the supposed ""privilege"" by misreading Delaware Chancery and federal court precedent.At most, the bidders said, targets of unsolicited bids are entitled to request a limited protective order to shield information related to their takeover defense.

272,"  (Adds comment from Allergan)By Alison FrankelNEW YORK (Reuters) -    Allergan's attempt to ward off a precedent-setting joint bid by the Canadian pharmaceutical company Valeant and the hedge fund Pershing Square continues to remake the rulebook for hostile takeovers. On Monday, U.S. District Judge David Carter of Santa Ana, Calif., ordered Allergan to turn over to lawyers for Valeant and Pershing the complete records of recent board meetings and other strategic documents despite Allergan's arguments that the documents would expose its plans for fending off the hostile bidders.The ruling came in Allergan's suit accusing Pershing of acquiring its shares based on insider information about Valeant's plan to acquire Allergan. Allergan is seeking to enjoin Pershing from voting its nearly 10 percent stake at a special meeting of Allergan shareholders scheduled to take place on Dec. 18. The company's lawyers at Latham & Watkins had argued that Allergan is entitled to shield sensitive information under a ""business strategy privilege"" that dates back to takeover defense litigation from the 1980s and 1990s.""This case is about one question: whether defendants violated federal insider trading and disclosure laws in connection with Valeant's proposed hostile attempt to take over Allergan,"" Allergan wrote in a brief. ""Defendants nevertheless seek to compel Allergan to produce some of the most competitively sensitive information in its possession - information that has nothing to do with those claims and that if disclosed to defendants (one of whom is Allergan's direct competitor), would substantially harm Allergan and its stockholders by impairing Allergan's ability to attract strategic transaction partners and negotiate effectively with them."" Pershing and Valeant (represented by Kirkland & Ellis and Sullivan & Cromwell) said Allergan had concocted the supposed ""privilege"" by misreading Delaware Chancery and federal court precedent. At most, the bidders said, targets of unsolicited bids are entitled to request a limited protective order to shield information related to their takeover defense. Allergan's large-scale redactions, according to Valeant and Pershing, far exceeded what's permissible.""It also appears that Allergan has redacted references to its plan to contact its large shareholders and attack defendants as improperly trading in Allergan's stock and engaging in improper activity,"" they said in a brief filed Saturday. ""Allergan's disclosures to its own shareholders of the exact information it claims defendants should disclose would directly undercut Allergan's claim that it should be provided an injunction to remedy the supposed lack of disclosure to these shareholders."" Judge Carter agreed with Pershing and Valeant that shielding business strategy documents is not a privilege like the attorney client and work product privileges, but a qualified right. Takeover targets have to show they're only redacting evidence that would ""reveal strategies for retaining or obtaining corporate control during a live corporate takeover situation."" In this case, he said, Allergan hadn't shown that its redaction of dozens of pages of documents, without any explanation of what the redactions cloak, is justified under the qualified business strategy doctrine.He ordered Allergan to turn over unredacted versions of all of the documents to Valeant and Pershing, subject to a previously approved confidentiality agreement that protects their public release. An Allergan spokesman sent me an email statement: ""We respectfully disagree with the court's decision and are reviewing our options. We believe Valeant and Pershing Square are conducting a fishing expedition for their own purposes and contrary to the best interests of Allergan stockholders. The Allergan records they seek are not relevant to whether Valeant and Pershing Square committed insider trading.""A lawyer for Pershing declined to provide a statement, but it's a good bet that when Judge Carter holds a hearing on Allergan's motion for a preliminary injunction on Oct. 28, Pershing and Valeant will have something to say about Allergan's own tactics.(This article has been updated to add comment from Allergan.)(Reporting by Alison Frankel)   (Reporting by Alison Frankel.

276,"   By Rod Nickel  Valeant Pharmaceuticals Inc (VRX.TO)(VRX.N) expects third-quarter revenue to beat analyst expectations and adjusted earnings per share to surpass the company's forecast, its CEO said on Wednesday, seeking to bolster a hostile takeover bid for Allergan Inc (AGN.N).Valeant will also beat guidance for third-quarter organic growth, restructuring charges and adjusted cash flow from operations, Chief Executive Officer Michael Pearson wrote in a letter to Allergan CEO David Pyott and lead independent director Michael Gallagher. Shares of both companies jumped.Laval, Quebec-based Valeant has offered $51 billion in stock and cash for Allergan, the California-based maker of Botox anti-wrinkle injections. Valeant's third-quarter results, due Oct. 20, are seen as pivotal to its efforts with activist investor Bill Ackman to remove most Allergan directors in a special shareholder meeting scheduled for Dec. 18.Some have criticized Valeant for modest organic growth, a metric that excludes acquisitions. But Pearson said he expects to show double-digit growth across most of Valeant's businesses and gains in market share.The improved guidance reflects, in part, new product launches such as Jublia, a treatment for a nail infection, said Tim Chiang, analyst at CRT Capital Group. ""I actually thing Valeant's business is going to improve in the second half of the year, and they're highlighting that,"" Chiang said. ""I think Valeant has a shot at acquiring Allergan. A lot of it is going to come down to the special meeting.""Pearson did not offer further details on expected third-quarter revenue and adjusted profit, which Valeant calls cash earnings per share.  Valeant had forecast adjusted earnings of $1.90 to $2.00 per share for the third quarter. Analysts were expecting earnings of $1.97 per share and revenue of $2.045 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Pearson said he was disappointed that Allergan continued to attack Valeant's business ""without any basis"" in correspondence between the companies on Monday after he requested a meeting. On Monday, Pyott and Gallagher responded that Allergan is concerned about the sustainability of Valeant's business model, which is built mostly around acquisitions, and that its financial disclosures are ""opaque.""  Valeant's third-quarter results are expected to make the company's performance clearer, since there is unlikely to be the usual number of restructuring and other one-time charges connected with acquisitions to obscure the bottom line. Valeant has slowed its pace of acquisitions while it pursues Allergan.Valeant stock jumped nearly 5 percent in Toronto and New York in morning trading. Allergan's U.S.-listed shares rose 2.5 percent.

282,"   By Caroline Humer and Bill Berkrot  Hedge fund ValueAct Capital said on Thursday it would return to the board of directors of Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc, which is pursuing a hostile takeover offer for Allergan Inc, and that it planned to increase its stake in the company.Valeant shares rose more than 3 percent.ValueAct Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Ubben said in a statement that once he is on the board, he would work with Valeant on its $53 billion acquisition of Allergan, a deal whose certainty he has previously questioned. Valeant and Pershing Square Capital Management, which owns nearly 10 percent of Allergan, made a bid in April for the Botox maker. Allergan has consistently rejected the offer and questioned the company's business methods, saying it relies too much on acquisitions for growth and cuts research and development too deeply. ValueAct, which owned 5.7 percent of Valeant as of June 30, had a seat on the company's board until May, when its representative, Mason Morfit, stepped down to devote time to the fund's largest holding, Microsoft Corp. ""They're basically saying: 'We're back on the board and looking to increase our position,'"" said analyst Umer Raffat of investment research firm ISI Group. ""I think both those things are going to be perceived very positively by people who have questioned Valeant's business model."" Ubben in August expressed some concerns about the hostile bid for Allergan, telling Reuters that while he still liked the it, a drawn-out battle to control the company would come at too high of a cost for Valeant if it lost other opportunities. Other investors had also said that they wanted to see more signs that the legal battles Allergan had mounted would not delay the deal well into 2015.

292,"  (Adds detail, analyst comment, shares)By Natalie GroverSept 29 Salix Pharmaceuticals Ltd said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved an expanded use of its constipation treatment.The injection, Relistor, has now been approved for use in patients on opioids for chronic pain unrelated to cancer, the company said on Monday.Relistor was first approved in 2008 to treat opioid-induced constipation in severely ill patients who did not respond to laxatives.It will compete with Nektar Therapeutics and AstraZeneca Plc's  oral drug Movantik, approved by the FDA earlier this month for the same patient population.Progenics Pharmaceuticals Inc, which licensed the worldwide rights to Relistor to Salix in 2011, stands to earn $40 million following the approval. An expanded use for Relistor raises the addressable patient population to 11 million from 1 million, with potential peak sales rising to more than $300 million from about $137 million, Salix Chief Executive Carolyn Logan said on the company's latest post-earnings conference call in August.The subcutaneous injection generated about $9 million in sales in the second quarter and will likely face tough competition from oral formulations.With the additional indication, Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Irina Koffler modeled $86.4 million in 2020 sales for Relistor.""We are more conservative than management because we assume fewer patients may utilize injectables, especially if oral Relistor launches during this time,"" Koffler said. Salix, which said it will merge with Cosmo Pharmaceuticals SpA's Irish subsidiary, is in talks with Allergan Inc  and Actavis Plc about a potential sale, sources have told Reuters in recent weeks.Relistor belongs to a class of drugs that fight the effects of opioid painkillers on the gut without reducing centrally mediated pain relief.These drugs, called peripherally acting mu opioid receptor antagonists (PAMORA), have been linked with cardiovascular risk in the past. The FDA in 2012 had sought additional cardiovascular outcome trial data when it rejected Salix's initial attempt to expand Relistor's label.However, an FDA panel recommendation that large cardiovascular safety trials were not needed prior to the approval of PAMORA drugs brightened the prospects of both Relistor and Movantik.Salix and Progenics are working to chart a path to approval for an oral version of the drug.Once approved, the oral formulation could expand the sales potential of Relistor to about $1.3 billion, CEO Logan had said.Koffler said an oral version of Relistor would eventually win approval but expects just $344 million in peak sales in 2023.Salix shares were largely unchanged after closing at $155.78 on the Nasdaq on Monday.

296,"   By Svea Herbst-Bayliss and Soyoung Kim | BOSTON/NEW YORK  BOSTON/NEW YORK Prominent investor shareholder advisory firm ISS called on Allergan Inc to give its shareholders a chance to vote on any large, buyout-blocking acquisitions and said the company's board faced a credibility problem, according to a report seen by Reuters.The ISS report comes as Allergan's largest shareholder, hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management, is urging the Botox maker to sell itself to rival Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc.ISS' pronouncements are watched by institutional investors including prominent mutual funds. This report could turn up the heat in the bitter fight over Allergan's future, industry analysts and investors said.Allergan has repeatedly rebuffed Valeant’s buyout proposals. Instead, Allergan is seeking to buy Salix Pharmaceuticals for cash, a deal would not require a shareholder vote, people familiar with the matter have said.A cash acquisition of Salix, which has a market capitalization of nearly $10 billion, would make Allergan too big and expensive for Valeant or another buyer, effectively defending the company from an unwanted takeover. ""To point out that the board has authority to approve an all-cash acquisition without shareholder approval is to point out the irrelevant: the question is not what the board can do, but what the board should do,"" ISS said in a report sent to clients on Wednesday.ISS said it is unusual for large shareholders to express concerns about a board's stewardship so publicly. Industry analysts and investors said the ISS report itself, which does not make any specific recommendation, is also unusual.""The board's public response to this highly unusual airing of concern from its major shareholders has been only to reiterate generically its 'focus' on 'enhancing stockholder value' with nary a word addressing the more crucial question raised by each of those major shareholders,"" ISS said. Investors owning more than 35 percent of Allergan shares have asked the company to call a special meeting, hoping to replace most of its directors with people receptive to Valeant's bid. Allergan set a special meeting for Dec. 18.""When more than a third of outstanding shares consent to call a special meeting ... there’s credible reason to believe that the board should give shareholders a real and binding choice between the buyout offer and the new strategic plan assembled in response,"" ISS said.On Friday, No. 2 shareholder T.Rowe Price urged Allergan to hold off on major acquisitions before the Dec. 18 meeting. T.Rowe also criticized the board, adding its voice to other Allergan shareholders including Pershing Square, Jackson Square Partners and Pentwater Capital Management, who combined own nearly a fifth of outstanding shares. They say hastily striking a large acquisition would thwart takeover offers for Allergan.These investors make a ""credible argument that the board should give shareholders a deciding vote on any large, buyout-blocking acquisitions,"" ISS said, adding that the board should not take unilateral action that would drive away potential bidders.Billionaire investor William Ackman's Pershing Square has been working with Valeant for months on a plan to buy Allergan.

298,"  (The opinions expressed here are those of Alison Frankel, a columnist for Reuters.)By Alison FrankelNEW YORK Is there any Allergan shareholder who isn't aware that William Ackman's hedge fund, Pershing Square Capital, and the Canadian pharmaceutical company Valeant slipped through a loophole in the securities laws when they teamed up on a hostile bid for the Botox maker?Or that Allergan believes the loophole is actually a violation of the law and Pershing is engaged in insider trading?If so, I'd like to know the name of the remote Pacific atoll where you've apparently been luxuriating without the Internet, newspapers and television for the past few months.This cleverly lawyered deal has been chronicled (including by me) with the sort of play-by-play analysis that's usually reserved for NFL playoff games or middle-school romances.Yet according to Allergan's new bid for a preliminary injunction, filed Monday night in federal court in Santa Ana, California, Allergan shareholders have been operating at a critical disadvantage: They haven't fully understood the risk that Pershing and Valeant were breaking the law.Allergan's lawyers at Latham & Watkins and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz argue not only that Pershing shouldn't be permitted to vote its nearly 10 percent stake when Allergan shareholders convene on Dec. 18 to consider the ouster of six Allergan board members, but also that Pershing should also be enjoined from voting the proxies it collects in the formal proxy fight the hedge fund launched on Sept. 29.Shareholders, according to Allergan, can't make a well-reasoned decision about replacing directors until Pershing discloses its supposed insider trading.""A preliminary injunction against voting proxies until supplemental disclosures have been made is the only means of avoiding an uninformed shareholder vote,"" Allergan said in the brief filed Monday.This is an interesting new tactic by Allergan.Some of the company's large shareholders have emerged publicly in the past couple of weeks to question the board's response to the Valeant takeover threat.Those statements doesn't necessarily mean that they or any other shareholders have tendered (or plan to tender) proxies to Pershing, although it's also worth pointing out that more than 30 percent of Allergan's shareholders joined Pershing's demand that the Allergan board convene a special meeting to vote on replacing directors. With this new injunction motion, Allergan is trying to neutralize whatever outside support Pershing has already amassed.'NO SUCH THING AS CO-BIDDERS' U.S. District Judge David Carter is holding a hearing on the Allergan injunction at the end of October. If Allergan obtains the injunction it's asking for, Pershing will have only six or seven weeks to relaunch its proxy campaign - with ""corrective disclosures"" about its alleged insider trading - in advance of the special shareholder meeting. And meanwhile, Allergan's own proxy statement went out Tuesday.Will Allergan win the preliminary injunctions it wants? You probably wouldn't change your bet on the answer to that question based on the public version of the company's new brief.The fact section of the brief is heavily redacted, so it's impossible to know whether Allergan has uncovered new evidence to back its contention that Pershing is an inside trader, not a joint bidder. The unredacted facts, Allergan alleges, aren't anything anyone hasn't already heard.The company has refined its legal arguments, though. You'll recall that Allergan's accusations of insider trading stem from the Williams Act, which prohibits anyone except an acquirer from trading on material non-public knowledge that the acquirer has taken ""a substantial step"" toward launching a tender offer. Pershing and Valeant said they'd worked around both prongs of the prohibition by making a joint offer for Allergan and by acquiring shares of Allergan before beginning to plan a tender offer.Allergan's new brief argues that for the purposes of insider trading, there is no such thing as co-bidders. The only reference to co-bidders in the securities laws, according to Allergan, is in disclosure provisions intended to prevent two or more buyers from secretly working together to amass a stake in a public company.The insider trading provisions, by contrast, hold that only an ""offering person"" - in the singular - is permitted to buy shares in advance of a tender offer.According to Allergan, there's no room in the statutory language or the legislative history of the insider trading provision for more than one acquirer.Pershing, it says, is more like the financier of Valeant's bid than a co-bidder - and bankers aren't permitted to trade based on inside information.""If one of the banks that is financing Valeant's hostile bid had, at Valeant's urging, purchased a substantial block of Allergan's shares in the weeks before the bid was announced and agreed to accept the inevitable post-announcement stock price appreciation in lieu of standard financing fees,"" Allergan said, ""there would be no question that Valeant and the bank had engaged in insider trading. This case is no different."" Allergan also argues that as soon as Valeant began plotting a hostile bid for Allergan, hiring lawyers and consultants and discussing financing with Pershing, it was taking ""substantial steps"" toward about a tender offer.Enforcement actions by the Securities and Exchange Commission, Allergan said, have established a quick trigger for the ban on trading in advance of a tender offer. According to Allergan, the prohibition was activated before Pershing bought a single share of the company.FOREVER CHANGE OWNERSHIP? Mostly, Allergan is arguing that if Judge Carter doesn't stop Valeant and Pershing, the loophole they exploited will expand until it swallows the law that's supposed to prevent insiders from trading in advance of a hostile tender offer.""Valeant and Pershing Square have invented a hostile takeover plan that, if found lawful, would forever change the way public companies are owned and acquired in the United States, at the expense of ordinary stockholders,"" the brief says.Interestingly, Allergan also says that its own ordinary stockholders have fled in droves since the Valeant takeover fight began.Allergan loyalists who don't want to get stuck with Valeant shares - Valeant's offer for Allergan is part cash, part stock - have, according to Allergan's brief, sold off their shares to speculators betting that Allergan's stock price will be driven up by Valeant's offer.The injunction Allergan is seeking would protect these Allergan-described arbitrageurs from tendering their shares without knowing enough about Pershing's allegedly illegal trades.Now you might think that opportunists sufficiently savvy to buy Allergan shares in order to capitalize on Valeant's Pershing-backed bid would be just the kind of investors who would already have factored in the risk that Pershing has violated insider trading laws, considering that Allergan first made those accusations two months ago. But Allergan seems to think that even arbitrageurs need its help.I guess the idea is that there's a difference between its accusations and a judge's findings. And, of course, there are those Pacific atoll shareholders to think about.Pershing and Valeant, represented by Kirkland & Ellis and Sullivan & Cromell, respectively, will respond to Allergan's brief next week. The preliminary injunction hearing is set for Oct. 28.(Reporting by Alison Frankel.

299,"   By Nadia Damouni and Soyoung Kim | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Actavis Plc ACT.N plans to approach Allergan Inc (AGN.N) again about a potential merger, as the Botox maker warms up to the possibility of a sale, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.Allergan, which has repeatedly rejected offers from Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc (VRX.TO), would consider a takeover proposal that values the company at above $200 per share, some of these people said.Actavis, which held informal conversations with Allergan in recent months about a possible combination, would like to take a hard look at buying the company and could reach out to its management team as soon as this week to reiterate its interest, one of the sources said.There has been no formal engagement between the two companies yet, the sources said, asking not to be named because the matter is not public.Separately, Valeant and its partner William Ackman are planning to boost their offer for Valeant by $15 per share to about $191 per share, the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday citing people familiar with the matter.Allergan, while fighting off Valeant's advances, did not reach out to other alternative buyers and instead focused on identifying opportunities for revenue growth and cost cuts internally. But it is aware of competing interest from other drugmakers, particularly from Actavis, the sources said.The emergence of Actavis as a serious rival suitor adds another twist to the months-long takeover battle between Valeant and Allergan. The Canadian drugmaker's bid already has attracted controversy because it is backed by activist investor Ackman, leading to a legal challenge from Allergan which has accused the two parties of insider trading.Shares of Allergan ended 1.7 percent higher at $186.20 on the New York Stock Exchange after rising more than 3 percent on the news, valuing the company at more than $55 billion. Actavis closed at $243.39 for a market capitalization of roughly $64 billion. Shares of Valeant fell 2.5 percent, putting the value of its existing cash and stock offer for Allergan at $175.94 per share, or $52.8 billion based on shares outstanding.Analysts have an average price target of around $200 per share for Allergan, with the price ranging from $174 to $240 per share, according to a Thomson Reuters poll of 16 analysts.Representatives for Allergan and Actavis declined to comment.Actavis' continued pursuit of Allergan comes as the takeover target faces a Dec. 18 special shareholder meeting, at which top Allergan investor Ackman's Pershing Square Capital Management hopes to replace a majority of the company's board. Pershing Square has teamed up with Valeant to pursue a takeover of Allergan, and is hoping to install new board members who could be more receptive to a takeover by the Canadian drugmaker.Actavis, which regularly reviews potential acquisitions, considers Allergan as the best opportunity currently and is hoping to engage in friendly discussions, the sources said.Industry executives have said Actavis would be a better cultural fit for Allergan because the companies' respective chief executives, Brent Saunders and David Pyott, believe in focusing on research and development, while Valeant CEO Mike Pearson is known for cost cutting.A large part of Allergan's business is ophthalmology, an area that Saunders is familiar with after serving as CEO of Bausch & Lomb. Valeant acquired Bausch & Lomb last year. DEFENSIVE ACQUISITION UNLIKELY Valeant and Pershing Square offered to buy Allergan on April 22 but Allergan has said the offer undervalued the company. Since then Allergan has announced cost cuts and said it was looking for acquisitions while trying to persuade shareholders they were better off remaining independent.But the possibility of Allergan making a potentially large acquisition has faced significant opposition from shareholders who feared such a deal would make the company too big and expensive for Valeant. Allergan had held on and off discussions with Salix Pharmaceuticals Ltd SLXP.O about buying the drugmaker for more than $10 billion in cash, people familiar with the matter said previously. A cash takeover would not have required a shareholder vote and could have put Allergan out of Valeant's reach.Those discussions stalled in part because Allergan considered Salix's valuation as high, and while the company continues to look at other deal opportunities, the likelihood of it striking a big acquisition before the Dec. 18 shareholder meeting is low, the sources said.

301,"   By Bill Berkrot  Oct 8 If Actavis Plc proceeds with a purchase of Botox maker Allergan Inc for potentially more than $60 billion, it will represent the biggest bet yet by one of the traditional generic drugmakers on the upside of expanding branded medicine holdings.Reuters reported on Tuesday that Actavis plans to approach Allergan about a potential merger, providing an alternative to the hostile pursuit by Valeant Pharmaceuticals International   that Allergan had repeatedly rebuffed.Such a transaction would accelerate a trend by the world's biggest generic drugmakers to build up their branded medicine portfolios and make Actavis one of the biggest players in specialty pharmaceuticals. Industry experts say the move would further break down the distinctions between generics, pharmaceuticals and biotechnology players.""Biotech is becoming even more complex, while big pharma is now where biotech was 10 years ago in terms of what they're looking for with cancer and orphan drug indications,"" said Sanford Bernstein analyst Ronny Gal, referring to expensive medications for rare diseases. ""And the generics are pushing in to where pharma used to be.""As the U.S. generics business becomes saturated, with more than 80 percent of prescriptions already being written for cheap generic drugs, manufacturers have increasingly turned their attention to higher-profit branded medicines. ""They all always had a little bit of branded activity. The next logical step is to get back into the U.S. market more on the branded side,"" said Canaccord Genuity analyst Corey Davis.Rival Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd, which has the world's largest portfolio of generic offerings, makes most of its profit from its branded multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone and added to its branded specialty drug holdings in 2011 with the $6.8 billion acquisition of Cephalon. Mylan Inc   sells EpiPen for severe allergic reactions and branded respiratory drugs.Actavis had already beefed up its specialty pharmaceuticals business with the $25 billion purchase of Forest Laboratories  this year and its $8.5 billion acquisition of Warner-Chilcott in 2013. With Allergan it would own Botox, which derives much of its annual $2.2 billion in sales from the anti-wrinkle business, and reap the benefits of the compound's growing medical uses, including for migraines, overactive bladder and upper limb spasticity, as well as a lucrative stable of ophthalmology drugs. Botox is also a very complex molecule that is extremely difficult to replicate, and so is in no imminent danger of facing generic competition of its own.""You walk away from the treadmill of having to reinvent yourself every 10 years,"" Gal said of the patent expiration cycle of traditional pharmaceuticals. New Actavis chief executive Brent Saunders has the right skill set to run the combined company, analysts said. Saunders was an executive at drugmaker Schering-Plough, before taking over as CEO of eye care company Bausch&Lomb and later specialty pharma company Forest Labs.""Probably the next logical step in his career is to run something on the scale that an Actavis/Allergan merger would create. I think he's got aspirations of turning Actavis into a much bigger company than it is now,"" Davis said.Saunders is almost surely going to be more palatable to Allergan management than Valeant Chief Executive Michael Pearson, who has a reputation of slashing research and development at companies he acquires.""He understands the opthalmology business and he's a pharma guy,"" Stern, Agee analyst Shibani Malhotra said of Saunders.""Both companies realize that this is one way that Allergan can sell the company, but be assured that they're selling to someone who would run the business like Allergan would run the business.""

302,"  (For more Reuters DEALTALKS, double click on )By Soyoung Kim and Nadia DamouniNEW YORK Oct 8 Earlier this week, Canada's Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc appeared to have its plan to buy Botox maker Allergan Inc all mapped out.The next phase in Valeant's months-long campaign to acquire Allergan for about $53 billion in cash and stock was to  announce ""blow-out"" earnings on Oct. 20, which would have led to a jump in its share price and, therefore, the value of its bid, according to people familiar with the situation.Valeant would have sweetened its offer even further, potentially bringing it somewhere between $195 per share and $200 per share from $175.94 per share as of Tuesday's closing price, these people said.The bump would have put further pressure on Allergan ahead of its Dec. 18 shareholders meeting at which some of its board members might be voted off, under a campaign led by hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, Valeant's partner in the attempted takeover. Valeant, Ackman and many investors had expected Allergan to lose the vote.However, Valeant's well-laid plans appeared to run into trouble this week, when rival drugmaker Actavis Plc came back into the picture as a possible white knight for Allergan.After months of insisting that it was better off staying independent or being the acquirer, Allergan, led by Chief Executive David Pyott, was warming up to the idea of considering an offer that values the Botox maker at above $200 per share or more than $60 billion - only not from Valeant, people familiar with the situation told Reuters on Tuesday.Meanwhile, a separate person said Actavis, which in recent months held informal conversations about a potential combination, would now like to take a hard look at buying Allergan and could reach out to the company as soon as this week to reiterate interest. Until recently, Allergan had indicated to Actavis that it wanted to stay independent, the source said.Allergan, Actavis and Valeant declined to comment. Representatives for Ackman could not be reached for comment. There is no assurance that Actavis will come up with a proposal high enough for Allergan to find attractive. Allergan will not consider a bid unless it sufficiently exceeds $200 per share, the sources said.DARK HORSE Still, the latest developments throw the question of Allergan's future wide open, just when Valeant was beginning to gain some traction on its bid, originally made in April.Last month, Valeant CEO Michael Pearson boosted his case for a deal by saying the Canadian drugmaker expects third-quarter revenue to beat analyst expectations and adjusted earnings per share to surpass the company's forecast.Some Allergan shareholders had also begun to express concerns that the Botox maker may go out and buy a large company without seeking shareholder approval in order to make it too expensive for Valeant to buy it. Allergan held on-and-off discussions with Salix Pharmaceuticals Ltd about buying the drugmaker for more than $10 billion in cash, a deal that would not have required a shareholder vote, Reuters previously reported. Earlier this month, influential proxy advisory firm ISS called on Allergan to give its shareholders a chance to vote on any large, buyout-blocking acquisitions and said the company's board faced a credibility problem.The latest twist in the saga also highlights the risks companies take when they enter into no-holds-barred, hostile takeover battles. One of the sources likened the situation to Comcast Corp's $45.2 billion deal to buy Time Warner Cable Inc earlier this year. In that case, a months-long pursuit by the initial instigator, Charter Communications Inc , had the effect of putting Time Warner Cable in play and creating the perfect opportunity for Comcast to swoop in.People familiar with the matter said that Valeant was worried about exactly such a situation.While it does not expect large pharmaceutical companies such as Johnson & Johnson or Sanofi SA to jump in to the fray, the Canadian drugmaker has considered Actavis as a dark horse, these people said.Valeant, which along with Ackman has spent nearly six months and millions of dollars in advisory fees on the pursuit, saw its shares fall 2.5 percent on Tuesday, after news of Actavis' continued interest broke. LOFTY VALUATIONS To be sure, sources on all sides of the battle said the field is still wide open. The bidding war is pushing up Allergan's shares to ever-lofty valuations.Valeant's math shows that at $200 per share, the deal will be dilutive for Actavis in the first year and could add a huge debt burden on the company, one source said.But some analysts said a deal could still work. At $210 per share, JPMorgan Chase analysts expect the deal would lead to a modest, mid-single-digit earnings per share accretion initially. Furthermore, it will expand Actavis' trading multiple ""significantly"" because it currently trades at 13 times 2016 forecast earnings, a discount to 19 times for Allergan.""We see significant upside for the stock at current levels,"" JPMorgan's Chris Schott said in a research note on Tuesday.Actavis thinks at $200 per share, Allergan gets expensive, but not prohibitively so, one source said. To make it work, Actavis would need to look for more synergies, something that it can do only once it is given access to Allergan's books, the source said.Actavis, which regularly reviews potential acquisitions, considers Allergan the best merger partner currently and is hoping to engage in friendly discussions, the sources said.For Allergan investors, meanwhile, a bidding war is proving to be good news. Allergan's shares closed 2.3 percent higher at $190.50 on Wednesday, after hitting a new high.""The decision by Allergan to oppose the Valeant offer looks increasingly like the right choice,"" BernsteinResearch analysts said in a research note on Wednesday. ""Allergan has created sufficient value to drive up the price of the offer from Valeant; it may have attracted an additional bidder - Actavis - into the mix.""

307,"  Botox maker Allergan Inc (AGN.N) said on Thursday it expects to report third-quarter profit that is more than 20 percent higher than it previously anticipated, which it said bolsters its contention that an unsolicited takeover offer by Valeant Pharmaceuticals Inc (VRX.TO) undervalues the company.Allergan shares were up 0.3 percent at $191.09 on Thursday morning, building slightly on gains made this week after Reuters reported that the company is also a target of Actavis Plc ACT.N. Valeant and Pershing Square Capital Management were also preparing to raise their bid this week, Reuters and other news organizations reported, which has also boosted shares. Allergan stock has gained about 15 percent since Sept. 22 when Reuters and others cited unnamed sources saying the company was considering a possible acquisition of Salix Pharmaceuticals SLXP.O. Those merger discussions have since dropped off, sources have said. Pursuing acquisitions is part of Allergan's strategy to fend off the $53 billion hostile takeover by Valeant. Allergan has criticized the company's model of growing through acquisitions and said drastic cuts in research and development would minimize Allergan's potential. ""Today's announced expectations for the third quarter and updated future outlook further demonstrate that there is a vast value gap between Valeant's offer and the intrinsic value of Allergan,"" Allergan Chief Executive David Pyott said in a statement. Allergan estimated adjusted earnings per share of $1.76 to $1.78 for the quarter ended Sept. 30, higher than its previous forecast of $1.44 to $1.47, helped by an increase in market share and product approvals.It said that its restructuring, which includes job cuts, will help earnings starting in the fourth quarter and throughout 2015. Analysts on average were expecting a third-quarter profit of $1.48 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Allergan also forecast full-year adjusted earnings of $6.20 to $6.25 per share, beating analysts' estimates of $5.81. For 2015, the company forecast earnings of $8.60 per share and for 2016, it put earnings at $10.25 per share.The company said it also expects a 14-15 percent increase in product net sales for the year and 17 percent in the quarter.

311,"  (Repeats Oct. 8 story for wider readership)By Bill BerkrotOct 8 If Actavis Plc proceeds with a purchase of Botox maker Allergan Inc for potentially more than $60 billion, it will represent the biggest bet yet by one of the traditional generic drugmakers on the upside of expanding branded medicine holdings.Reuters reported on Tuesday that Actavis plans to approach Allergan about a potential merger, providing an alternative to the hostile pursuit by Valeant Pharmaceuticals International   that Allergan had repeatedly rebuffed.Such a transaction would accelerate a trend by the world's biggest generic drugmakers to build up their branded medicine portfolios and make Actavis one of the biggest players in specialty pharmaceuticals. Industry experts say the move would further break down the distinctions between generics, pharmaceuticals and biotechnology players.""Biotech is becoming even more complex, while big pharma is now where biotech was 10 years ago in terms of what they're looking for with cancer and orphan drug indications,"" said Sanford Bernstein analyst Ronny Gal, referring to expensive medications for rare diseases. ""And the generics are pushing in to where pharma used to be."" As the U.S. generics business becomes saturated, with more than 80 percent of prescriptions already being written for cheap generic drugs, manufacturers have increasingly turned their attention to higher-profit branded medicines.""They all always had a little bit of branded activity. The next logical step is to get back into the U.S. market more on the branded side,"" said Canaccord Genuity analyst Corey Davis.Rival Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd, which has the world's largest portfolio of generic offerings, makes most of its profit from its branded multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone and added to its branded specialty drug holdings in 2011 with the $6.8 billion acquisition of Cephalon. Mylan Inc   sells EpiPen for severe allergic reactions and branded respiratory drugs. Actavis had already beefed up its specialty pharmaceuticals business with the $25 billion purchase of Forest Laboratories  this year and its $8.5 billion acquisition of Warner-Chilcott in 2013.With Allergan it would own Botox, which derives much of its annual $2.2 billion in sales from the anti-wrinkle business, and reap the benefits of the compound's growing medical uses, including for migraines, overactive bladder and upper limb spasticity, as well as a lucrative stable of ophthalmology drugs. Botox is also a very complex molecule that is extremely difficult to replicate, and so is in no imminent danger of facing generic competition of its own.""You walk away from the treadmill of having to reinvent yourself every 10 years,"" Gal said of the patent expiration cycle of traditional pharmaceuticals. New Actavis chief executive Brent Saunders has the right skill set to run the combined company, analysts said. Saunders was an executive at drugmaker Schering-Plough, before taking over as CEO of eye care company Bausch&Lomb and later specialty pharma company Forest Labs.""Probably the next logical step in his career is to run something on the scale that an Actavis/Allergan merger would create. I think he's got aspirations of turning Actavis into a much bigger company than it is now,"" Davis said.Saunders is almost surely going to be more palatable to Allergan management than Valeant Chief Executive Michael Pearson, who has a reputation of slashing research and development at companies he acquires.""He understands the opthalmology business and he's a pharma guy,"" Stern, Agee analyst Shibani Malhotra said of Saunders.""Both companies realize that this is one way that Allergan can sell the company, but be assured that they're selling to someone who would run the business like Allergan would run the business.""

312,"   By Soyoung Kim and Tim McLaughlin | NEW YORK/BOSTON  NEW YORK/BOSTON Fidelity Investments, the largest shareholder in Actavis Plc ACT.N, has increased its holdings in takeover-target Allergan (AGN.N) in recent months and would be supportive of a potential merger between the two drugmakers, according to people familiar with the matter.The Boston-based investment firm, which collectively owned 3.88 million Allergan shares through several of its funds as of end-June, had added roughly 2 million shares by the end of August, according to Thomson Reuters data based on Fidelity's monthly filings.The additions would likely make Fidelity the No.8 shareholder in Allergan, according to Thomson Reuters data, assuming there was no significant changing of hands in the company's top-10 shareholder base. Fidelity is currently Actavis' top shareholder with a 6.3 percent stake, according to Thomson Reuters data.Fidelity would be open to taking Actavis' shares if the drugmaker comes up with a rival bid using its own stock as currency, the sources said, asking not to be named because they are not authorized to speak to the media. The fund managers also like Allergan's standalone business plan, the sources added.Revelations of Fidelity's increased holdings in Allergan come days after Reuters reported that Actavis was planning to make a new approach to the Botox maker about a merger, potentially challenging Valeant Pharmaceuticals Inc's (VRX.TO) (VRX.N) unsolicited bid for Allergan. Boosting its Allergan ownership also contrasts with Fidelity's recently reduced bets in Valeant. Two of Fidelity's top stock pickers unloaded most of their holdings in Valeant after the Canadian drugmaker in April unveiled its bid for Allergan, which has marked one of 2014's most contentious takeover battles. Some Fidelity fund managers are reluctant to support Valeant's cash and stock proposal in part because they have questions about the value of Valeant's stock, according to the people familiar with the matter. Allergan Chief Executive David Pyott has regularly cast doubts on the value and sustainability of Valeant stock, saying the rival's share performance has been driven by financial engineering and ""unsustainable"" price increases.Allergan declined to comment. Representatives for Fidelity also declined to comment. Several analysts said in research notes this week that Allergan shareholders would prefer a competitive offer from Actavis over Valeant's bid.""Based on our discussions with investors, we believe fundamental investors who own Allergan... are inherently more comfortable with the Actavis business model than the Valeant model,"" BernsteinResearch analysts said in a Wednesday note. ""Exchanging Allergan shares for Actavis shares would not force many of them to sell, as they might with Valeant position.""Industry executives say Actavis would be a better cultural fit for Allergan because the companies' respective chief executives, Brent Saunders and David Pyott, believe in focusing on research and development, while Valeant CEO Mike Pearson is known for cost cutting.To be sure, Valeant still has a powerful ally. Hedge fund manager William Ackman has amassed a 9.7 percent stake in Allergan to make him the company's largest shareholder, and has teamed up with Valeant to pursue a joint bid. T.Rowe Price, the second-largest shareholder in Allergan with a stake of near 5.4 percent, is also Valeant's No.3 investor with a 4.9 percent stake, and would likely benefit from a combination between the two companies.Ackman has secured investors who collectively own more than 35 percent of Allergan shares, including his position, to call for a special shareholder meeting on Dec. 18, at which he hopes to replace majority of the company's board.The prospect of a bidding war, as well as Allergan's own improving performance, has driven its shares to all-time highs this week, with the stock trading at $187.55 on the New York Stock Exchange, well above Valeant's offer.On Thursday, Allergan lifted its third-quarter profit estimate and said the updated forecast showed that Valeant's takeover offer undervalued the company. Shares of Valeant have come under pressure, however, as doubts increase about whether its bid will succeed. The stock fell 2.8 percent to $122.35 on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday, valuing its Allergan bid at $173.55 per share, or just below $52 billion.

313,"   By Alastair Sharp and Allison Martell | TORONTO  TORONTO Billionaire investor William Ackman turned up the heat on Allergan Inc. on Thursday when he accused the Botox maker’s board of misleading investors to fend off a hostile takeover bid from Valeant Pharmaceuticals.Ackman, whose hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management is Allergan’s biggest shareholder, told reporters that his lawyers had seen documents that show Allergan’s board knowingly released misleading statements about Valeant.""We've actually found evidence that will come out in the next few days of attempts at manipulating Valeant's stock price down,"" Ackman said, noting that he has not seen that evidence because it has been marked as ""highly confidential.""Valeant's New York-listed shares climbed 3.6 percent in afternoon trading. They have lost about 6 percent in often volatile dealings since Valeant bid for Allergan in late April.Allergan's shares edged up 0.7 percent.Allergan declined to comment and Reuters could not independently verify Ackman's claim. Allergan executives have previously said the concerns they expressed about Valeant were based on their knowledge of the Canadian company and the industry.In an unusual alliance, even by hedge fund industry standards, Ackman has been working with Valeant for months to push the Botox maker into selling itself to Valeant. Allergan has steadfastly refused, calling Valeant’s offer too low and looking for other partners to avoid a deal with Valeant. ""We believe they put those statements out, that they knew that they were false at the time they made them, and we have found evidence to that effect, that this was a conscious takeover defense strategy to malign Valeant and the company,"" Ackman said after speaking at a conference.Pershing Square is expected to file court documents early next week related to Allergan's lawsuit, which accuses the hedge fund and Valeant of breaking insider trading rules, said a person familiar with the matter but not authorized to discuss it publicly.It is not clear if those court documents will include the material that Ackman says exists about the Allergan board's alleged misleading of investors. ""I think it will come to light in the context of litigation,"" Ackman said, giving only a vague hint of when the material will be made public.Sources familiar with Valeant and Pershing Square have hinted that the company might be willing to raise its bid for Allergan, possibly as soon as next week when Valeant is  expected to release earnings which the company has signaled will be strong.Ackman has lined up a list of other big investors who have called on Allergan to call a special meeting in December where the hedge fund manager is expected to try and replace Allergan board members with his own directors who might be more receptive to Valeant's overtures.As the battle for Allergan drags on each side has ratcheted up the rhetoric. In a letter to the Allergan board in September, Ackman accused them of having libeled Valeant and said he had complained to U.S. and Canadian regulators.Separately, last month Valeant Chief Executive Officer Michael Pearson wrote to Allergan alleging that it was making ""baseless attacks"" about his company. Allergan Chief Executive David Pyott and lead independent director Michael Gallagher said at the time that the company relied on its knowledge of Valeant and of the industry to express concerns about Valeant's business model.Valeant did not comment on Ackman's remarks.Known for making big bets on companies including Canadian Pacific and General Growth Properties, Ackman has also relied on the media to press his points.

It is not clear if those court documents will include the material that Ackman says exists about the Allergan board's alleged misleading of investors.""I think it will come to light in the context of litigation,"" Ackman said, giving only a vague hint of when the material will be made public.Sources familiar with Valeant and Pershing Square have hinted that the company might be willing to raise its bid for Allergan, possibly as soon as next week when Valeant is  expected to release earnings which the company has signaled will be strong. Ackman has lined up a list of other big investors who have called on Allergan to call a special meeting in December where the hedge fund manager is expected to try and replace Allergan board members with his own directors who might be more receptive to Valeant's overtures.As the battle for Allergan drags on each side has ratcheted up the rhetoric.In a letter to the Allergan board in September, Ackman accused them of having libeled Valeant and said he had complained to U.S. and Canadian regulators.Separately, last month Valeant Chief Executive Officer Michael Pearson wrote to Allergan alleging that it was making ""baseless attacks"" about his company. Allergan Chief Executive David Pyott and lead independent director Michael Gallagher said at the time that the company relied on its knowledge of Valeant and of the industry to express concerns about Valeant's business model.Valeant did not comment on Ackman's remarks.Known for making big bets on companies including Canadian Pacific and General Growth Properties, Ackman has also relied on the media to press his points.

316,"   By Olivia Oran  Allergan Inc (AGN.N) shareholder Paulson & Co is urging the Botox maker to merge with specialty pharmaceutical company Shire Plc (SHP.L) as an alternative to a deal with hostile bidder Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc (VRX.TO), according to two people familiar with the matter.The hedge fund, which earlier supported a deal with Valeant, told Allergan CEO David Pyott that it would now support a deal with Shire, the sources said. It was not immediately clear whether Allergan would pursue such a deal. Paulson had a 1.9 percent stake in Allergan, making it one of the company's top 10 shareholders, according to Thomson Reuters data as of June 30. Paulson was also Shire's third-largest shareholder, according to the data. Allergan and Paulson declined to comment. Shire, which makes drugs to treat attention deficit disorder and rare diseases, was not immediately available for comment.  Paulson's move, which adds a new twist in the battle for Allergan, comes after Shire's $54 billion ""tax inversion"" deal to sell itself to AbbVie Inc (ABBV.N) fell apart after the U.S. government proposed new rules to make such transactions less attractive. Last week, AbbVie's board recommended that shareholders vote against the deal. The U-turn caused Shire's shares to plunge, with Paulson and other investors seeing the value of their holdings fall. Paulson had a 1.7 percent stake in Shire as of June 30, according to Thomson Reuters data.The sources said any deal between Allergan and Shire, which is based in Dublin, would not be structured as a so-called tax inversion.  SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analysts previously said a deal between Allergan and Shire could make sense because it would diversify the sales mix, expand Shire’s geographic reach and preserve research and development programs. Allergan shareholders, including Paulson, have been looking at alternative strategies for the company as it tries to fend off Valeant. The Canadian company teamed up with activist investor Bill Ackman in April to bid for Allergan.  Valeant might raise its bid for Allergan and will not abandon its pursuit ahead of a Dec. 18 special meeting, Michael Pearson, CEO of the Laval, Quebec-based company, said on Monday. Some large Allergan shareholders have said they would prefer a deal with drugmaker Actavis Plc ACT.N to a tie-up with Shire.

Brent crude oil, which had fallen to four-year lows last week, rebounded to rise to about $86 a barrel after data showed robust oil demand in China, which is the world's largest energy consumer.""The oil majors are benefiting from a rise in the underlying oil price, but unless the crude oil price can move much further beyond last week's lows and hold onto the rebound, those oil stocks could fall back again,"" said Dafydd Davies, partner at Charles Hanover Investments.

334,"  (The opinions expressed here are those of Alison Frankel, a columnist for Reuters.)By Alison FrankelNEW YORK Earlier this week, I told you about new filings by the Canadian pharmaceutical company Valeant and the hedge fund Pershing Capital that suggested their target Allergan had disregarded advice from its financial adviser Goldman Sachs.The Pershing and Valeant briefs were heavily redacted and the underlying exhibits were sealed, but the implication from unredacted snippets was that Goldman had suggested Allergan request accounting information from Valeant and Allergan rejected the recommendation. Then, according to Pershing and Valeant, after Goldman refused to go along with attacks on Valeant's business model, Allergan hired additional experts with no such reservations.Much of the once-sealed evidence in the case is now public. It's must-read stuff for M&A buffs - an unusually robust account of one of the most innovative and celebrated takeover battles I can remember. But I don't see much in the emails or testimony to prove that Allergan refused to follow Goldman's advice to engage with Allergan.'VALEANT IS VILE' There are definitely some headaches for Allergan in the newly disclosed emails, including one from CEO David Pyott to Allergan corporate development vice president David Lawrence, summarily rejecting Lawrence's suggestion that Allergan tone down a presentation entitled ""Valeant Is Vile.""Lawrence subsequently emailed Allergan's CFO, describing how Pyott had ""paddled"" him for objecting to the presentation and how he'd since been excluded from directors' meetings and consultations with Allergan's financial advisers. (Lawrence also sent a copy of his original email to Pyott to his personal email account, an interesting move.)There's also some new evidence to back up Pershing chief William Ackman's claim that Allergan deliberately set out to drive down Valeant's share price as part of Allergan's defense against the hostile bid.As far back as March 2014 - before Valeant and Pershing even surfaced with an unsolicited bid for Allergan - Allergan was modeling negative forecasts for Valeant, according to an internal email.By June, with Allergan's anti-Valeant campaign underway, Allergan CEO Pyott was ""taking credit"" for a $5 drop in Valeant shares, according to an exchange between the Allergan CFO and an adviser from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.The next month, Pyott asked M&A adviser Innisfree for a list of Valeant's top shareholders, presumably in connection with what Pershing and Valeant have described as Allergan's ""highly unusual"" roadshow to convince Valeant shareholders to oppose the takeover bid. And in a July 14 presentation to the Allergan board, Allergan's bankers at Goldman Sachs and Merrill highlighted the fall in Valeant's share price - to below its levels preceding the Allergan offer - as a sign of the success of Allergan's tactics.But let's get back to the Pershing and Valeant representation in filings this week that Allergan rejected ""Goldman's recommendation to ask for information from Valeant"" and ""disregarded input"" from its outside advisers about Valeant's business model.GOLDMAN'S ""WHITE HAT"" There is no smoking-gun Allergan email to back that assertion. On May 19, a Goldman banker sent Merrill counterparts and Allergan officials an email describing Tenet Healthcare's fraud suit against Community Health Systems, which was part of Tenet's defense against Community's hostile takeover bid.Tenet had obtained the information at the heart of its suit through a non-disclosure agreement, the Goldman email said. Goldman seemed to intimate that Allergan might be able to pull off a similar coup. If Allergan were actually to begin negotiations with Valeant, the email said, ""we would have the opportunity to do real, detailed due diligence of V as well. We would also insist in the NDA that we have the right to make our findings public to our shareholders as fiduciaries. V may never agree to this, which in and of itself would be telling.""Is that really a recommendation to request information from Valeant? It seems more like a hypothetical to me. I didn't see any subsequent reference to the non-disclosure agreement idea, though in a separate email chain with a different Goldman banker the same day, Allergan's CEO said, ""I need Goldman to take off its white hat and put on a darker one."" (The Goldman banker responded, ""I hear you!"")Pershing and Valeant claimed that Allergan's ""Valeant Is Vile"" presentation was vetted by Allergan accounting advisers Alvarez & Marsal and FTI Consulting because Goldman Sachs and Merrill refused to go along with Allergan's criticisms of Valeant.(Both banks had been bullish about Valeant in recent analyst reports, and Goldman was the sole underwriter in a $2.3 billion Valeant stock offering in 2013, in which it invested $300 million in Valeant shares.)But when Pershing lawyer Mark Holscher of Kirkland & Ellis asked Pyott during the CEO's deposition about Goldman's view of the ""Valeant Is Vile"" Powerpoint, Pyott refused to concede that Goldman had any problem with it.""I think the word 'approve' is wrong, because at the end of day, the only person who puts out the presentation is ourselves,"" Pyott testified. ""Obviously if they had some form of objection, I would be listening carefully."" Holscher directly asked Allergan's lead director, Michael Gallagher, if Goldman and Merrill told him Valeant had an unsustainable business model. ""They agreed that it did, yes,"" Gallagher replied.Holscher also asked whether Allergan had considered a non-disclosure agreement to obtain information from Valeant. Gallagher said no: That request would have sent the wrong message to the marketplace and, besides, Allergan already knew plenty about Valeant's business model.(Allergan's shareholders may be wondering why the company is paying $6 million a quarter for financial advice to both Goldman and Merrill - according to Holscher's questions to Gallagher - if its board already knows everything it needs to know about Valeant's business, but that's another story.)MUD-SLINGING Allergan shareholders, as you know, are weighing Pershing proposals to oust six board members and begin talks with Valeant. Both sides seem to believe that the more mud they can throw at the other, the better their chance of winning the proxy fight.Allergan says Pershing is an inside trader and Valeant is a company with an unsustainable business plan. The hostile bidders say Allergan's board members are breaching their duties to shareholders in a desperate effort to save their own jobs.Bill Ackman said in his deposition in the Allergan litigation that he doesn't like to describe unsolicited offers as ""hostile"" bids, preferring to call them ""happy deals"" because ""there are very few unhappy shareholders when a company makes a public proposal to acquire a business.""I'm sure the arbitrageurs who have bought Allergan shares since the Valeant offer last April have been happy to see the upward trend line of the company's share price in the last six months.But when you're caught in the middle of a mud fight, you can't help feeling a little dirty.(Reporting by Alison Frankel.

""To be clear, Valeant is prepared to improve its offer and provide value to your shareholders of at least $200 a share. We are confident that an increase in our stock price, and in consideration, will provide that value,"" Valeant Chief Executive Officer Michael Pearson said in the letter.At $200 per share, the offer would be worth more than $59 billion.Allergan said the letter was a tactic to distract investors from Allergan third-quarter earnings, which it announced on Monday morning and did not include offer details.""I think all we saw today was an offer to negotiate,"" Allergan Chief Executive Officer David Pyott said during a conference call.  Valeant and hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management launched a hostile offer for Allergan in April, but the Botox maker has staunchly refused it. The company has said that shareholders will be better off if it stays independent or finds its own acquisitions. Pyott declined to answer questions during the call about whether or not the company is pursuing a ""white knight"" acquirer for Allergan or its own purchases.  Allergan will hold a shareholder meeting on Dec. 18 at the request of investors who own more than 35 percent of the company's stock, including Pershing Square head William Ackman. Investors will vote on new directors put forth by Ackman and to open discussions on the deal.A hearing is scheduled on Tuesday in federal court in California where a judge will hear from both sides on if Ackman's stake in Allergan of nearly 10 percent should count as part of that shareholder vote. Allergan asked to exclude the shares as part of an insider trading suit it filed against Valeant and Pershing Square.Separately on Monday, Allergan reported a third-quarter profit of $1.78 per share, excluding items. On Oct. 9, the company preannounced those earnings and said it would report a profit that was more than 20 percent higher than it had previously expected, in the range of $1.76 to $1.78 per share. Allergan also raised the outlook for the current quarter, saying it now expects earnings of $1.80 to $1.83 per share, and for the year of $6.27 to $6.30 per share.Allergan's shares were off 0.1 percent or 20 cents at $184.01 on Monday.

339,"   By Caroline Humer and Nadia Damouni  Botox maker Allergan Inc (AGN.N), fighting a hostile takeover bid by Valeant Pharmaceuticals Inc (VRX.TO), said on Monday it was approached about a potential transaction by another party, identified as Actavis Plc ACT.N by a source familiar with the situation.Valeant and Pershing Square Capital Management, which owns nearly a 10 percent stake in Allergan, made an offer that is now worth $55 billion for Allergan.Allergan has been fighting a six-month-old takeover battle with Valeant and is trying to convince investors that Valeant's plan for cost-cutting is too extreme.Reuters reported in early October that Actavis, which had already reached out to Allergan once in the prior months, was planning a second approach to the company with an offer worth more than $200 per share.Last week during a conference call with analysts, Allergan Chief Executive Officer David Pyott was asked if the company had received an offer from another party besides Valeant. He responded that he could not comment on ""any particular market rumor."" It was not clear if Allergan's disclosure on Monday referred to a new approach or to one of the older overtures. Valeant, whose cash-and-stock offer is worth about $182 per share, recently said it was prepared to raise its offer so that it would be worth around $200 per share. Activist investor William Ackman, who runs Pershing Square, spearheaded calling a vote on new board members at a special meeting of Allergan shareholders. The meeting will be held Dec. 18. Allergan, which has sued Valeant and Ackman claiming insider trading, is waiting to decide on the Actavis approach to see if a California judge will issue a temporary injunction to exclude Ackman from voting at the meeting, a second source familiar with the situation said. If the ruling goes against Allergan, that could push the company to the table with Actavis, the source said. A hearing on the issue was held last Tuesday and a ruling was expected any day.Separately, Allergan confirmed that business development head David Lawrence had left the company recently.

340,"  (Adds Actavis to lead, details, updates stock prices)By Caroline Humer and Nadia DamouniNov 3 Botox maker Allergan Inc, fighting a hostile takeover bid by Valeant Pharmaceuticals Inc, said on Monday it was approached about a potential transaction by another party, identified as Actavis Plc by a source familiar with the situation.Valeant and Pershing Square Capital Management, which owns nearly a 10 percent stake in Allergan, made an offer that is now worth $55 billion for Allergan.Allergan has been fighting a six-month-old takeover battle with Valeant and is trying to convince investors that Valeant's plan for cost-cutting is too extreme.Reuters reported in early October that Actavis, which had already reached out to Allergan once in the prior months, was planning a second approach to the company with an offer worth more than $200 per share. Last week during a conference call with analysts, Allergan Chief Executive Officer David Pyott was asked if the company had received an offer from another party besides Valeant. He responded that he could not comment on ""any particular market rumor.""It was not clear if Allergan's disclosure on Monday referred to a new approach or to one of the older overtures.Valeant, whose cash-and-stock offer is worth about $182 per share, recently said it was prepared to raise its offer so that it would be worth around $200 per share. Activist investor William Ackman, who runs Pershing Square, spearheaded calling a vote on new board members at a special meeting of Allergan shareholders. The meeting will be held Dec. 18.Allergan, which has sued Valeant and Ackman claiming insider trading, is waiting to decide on the Actavis approach to see if a California judge will issue a temporary injunction to exclude Ackman from voting at the meeting, a second source familiar with the situation said. If the ruling goes against Allergan, that could push the company to the table with Actavis, the source said. A hearing on the issue was held last Tuesday and a ruling was expected any day.Separately, Allergan confirmed that business development head David Lawrence had left the company recently. His departure followed that of Allergan's top financial executive, who left this summer for family reasons.""David Lawrence made the decision to retire from Allergan in the beginning of September to commit more time to his health and family,"" an Allergan spokesman said in a statement.The spokesman declined to comment on emails written by Lawrence and disclosed as part of the insider trading lawsuit in which he described being ""paddled"" by the company's top executive for suggesting it tone down a presentation called ""Valeant is Vile.""Allergan shares rose $2.58, or 1.4 percent, to $192.64, about 6 percent above Valeant's offer price, while Actavis gained $4.74, or 2 percent, to $247.48.

But on Monday Chief Executive Christian Zahnd said a recent upturn in financial markets, combined with support from investors and the uncertain appetite for IPOs in the coming months, had prompted Molecular Partners to resume its share issue.The company priced the shares at 22.40 Swiss francs, having previously set a range of 28-35 francs. A source familiar with matter said books had been covered on the IPO.""There is a certain level of uncertainty where the markets will be six or nine months from now,"" Zahnd told Reuters. ""And so we clearly said, if there's the possibility to go out we should do it, as the most important thing for us is to build the basis for the successful long-term development of the company,"" he said, adding that the company was ""very comfortable"" with the final price.Molecular Partners said it expected gross proceeds of about 96 million Swiss francs ($100 million), before an overallotment option. It had previously hoped to earn 121-151 million francs from the issue.The money will be used in part to fund product development, research and acquisitions of complementary businesses and technology, the company said. The bookbuilding period, which began on Monday, is expected to last until last until 1200 GMT on Tuesday and the company expects the shares to make their market debut on the SIX Swiss Exchange on Wednesday.U.S. health care company Allergan will make an anchor order at the IPO, Molecular Partners said. It did not disclose the size of the order.JP Morgan is acting as the sole global coordinator and joint bookrunner for the issue while UBS is acting as joint bookrunner.The faltering appetite for stock market listings in the weeks before Molecular Partners postponed its IPO had prompted several companies including French energy services group Spie and Italian cosmetic firm Intercos to pull their planned flotations.(1 US dollar = 0.9645 Swiss franc)   (Reporting by Joshua Franklin; Additional reporting by Freya Berry in London; Editing by Pravin Char)",2014-11-03,AGN,"Mon Nov 3, 2014 | 6:39am EST",UPDATE 1-Molecular Partners resumes share offer at lower price,http://www.reuters.com//article/molecular-prtnrs-ipo-idUSL6N0ST1XN20141103?type=companyNews

Changing the bylaws is just one of the proxy proposals made by Ackman, who also wants to remove board members and compel Allergan into takeover talks.The amended laws now include a provision that requires Allergan's board to call for a meeting within 90 days of a valid request rather than exercise its discretion, Allergan said. The company also reduced the amount of information required from someone calling for a special meeting, and eliminated a requirement to disclose who is acting in concert with the shareholder making the proposal.Ackman and proxy advisory firms pressured Allergan to change these rules, saying they were too onerous.Allergan shares were up 46 cents at $195.80 in afternoon trading, while Valeant was $1.07 higher at $131.10, both on the New York Stock Exchange.

355,"  Nov 12 Allergan Inc changed its bylaws associated with calling a special shareholder meeting, about a month before such a meeting where William Ackman, the Botox maker's biggest shareholder, aims to replace most of Allergan's board.Ackman, whose hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management owns nearly 10 percent of Allergan, is pushing the company to sell itself to Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc , a move that Allergan has constantly rebuffed.The amended laws now includes a provision that requires Allergan's board to call for a meeting within 90 days of a valid request rather than exercise its discretion in setting a date, Allergan said in a statement on Wednesday. The company also reduced the amount of information required to be submitted by a shareholder calling for a special meeting, and eliminated the requirement that the shareholder disclose who else is ""acting in concert with the proposing person"". Ackman and Valeant have gathered investors representing an additional 25 percent of Allergan shares in order to call the special meeting on Dec. 18. They want to use the proxy battle as a platform to force Allergan to open talks about a deal. The amendments to the bylaws are to ensure next month's meeting ""is focused on the question of value,"" Michael Gallagher, Allergan's lead independent director said.""Allergan remains confident that it can create more value than Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc's offer to acquire the company's shares,"" Gallagher said.

But he said the outperformance of larger-cap names compared with smaller caps shows investors still are gravitating toward the more liquid investments. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 13.01 points, or 0.07 percent, to 17,647.75, the S&P 500 gained 1.5 points, or 0.07 percent, to 2,041.32, a record closing high.Nasdaq Composite dropped 17.54 points, or 0.37 percent, to 4,671.00, while the small-cap Russell 2000 index ended down 0.8 percent.Shares of LinkedIn dropped 4.5 percent to $223.28.

361,"   By Caroline Humer  Botox maker Allergan Inc on Monday accepted a $66 billion takeover bid from Actavis Plc, ending a seven-month hostile pursuit by activist investor William Ackman and Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc.    Dublin-based Actavis offered $219 per share in cash and stock, amounting to billions more than Canada's Valeant was prepared to pay. Valeant said it would walk away from its Allergan campaign shortly after the deal was announced. Ackman was not available for comment.The deal marks a surprise win for Allergan, which had fought the Valeant-Pershing alliance in court and among shareholders in one of the healthcare sector's most complex takeover efforts. Allergan shares rose 5.3 percent to close at $209.20. Actavis gained 1.7 percent to $247.94.Allergan had argued that the Valeant cash-and-stock offer, most recently worth about $54 billion, would hurt its shareholders, given the Canadian drugmaker's history of cutting research and development spending at companies it acquires.Besides the higher price tag, the Actavis deal came with only $400 million in R&D cuts for Allergan, far less than the $900 million decrease that Valeant had proposed, the companies said on a conference call with investors.    Actavis’ approach may help the two companies integrate their operations and ensure some of Allergan's promising experimental eye treatments for macular degeneration and glaucoma remain in the pipeline. ""If these bets turn out well, Actavis will be seen as a better call,"" said Morningstar analyst Michael Waterhouse.Ackman in late April disclosed a nearly 10 percent stake in Allergan and plans to bid for the company together with Valeant. Despite losing his takeover target, Ackman's Pershing Square will earn at least $2.3 billion from Allergan's buyout by Actavis.  The $18 billion hedge fund has roughly 30 percent of its capital invested in Allergan, whose share price has nearly doubled from the $126.54 it paid earlier this year. Valeant, meanwhile, may find new acquisition targets more willing to push back on its overtures, some of its investors said.FRIENDLY APPROACH   Actavis Chief Executive Officer Brent Saunders said in an interview that he had reached out to Allergan CEO David Pyott many times during the Valeant-Ackman campaign to express his interest in a combination.""As he was in discussions, or the throes of battle, with Valeant and Pershing Square, we would connect from time to time,"" Saunders said, ""and I would let him know that we were a friend and we thought it made sense - from 10,000 feet - to combine the businesses."" But talks with Actavis did not begin in earnest until a few weeks ago. Until then, Pyott had publicly fought to keep his company independent and told investors that Allergan was working on acquisitions that would pay off. Sources familiar with the matter told Reuters that they included discussions about a more than $10 billion deal for Salix Pharmaceuticals that did not materialize. Allergan also sued Valeant and Ackman, saying that when the hedge fund teamed up with the drugmaker before it made the joint April offer, it broke insider trading rules.  Ackman and Valeant fought back with a proxy battle, seeking to replace Allergan board members and initiating a special shareholder meeting for Dec. 18 to compel the company to negotiate. Under the buyout deal, Actavis will lead a combined company with $23 billion in revenue from Allergan's ophthalmology, neurosciences, and dermatology business and Actavis' gastroenterology and women's health franchises. In the last two years, Actavis has purchased Forest Laboratories, which Saunders ran, and Warner Chilcott, which enabled it to move headquarters to Dublin.Actavis said it expected $1.8 billion in savings, on top of the $475 million in cuts that Allergan has already made this year. Valeant planned on savings of about $2.7 billion.The new company will operate from both California, where Allergan is based, and New Jersey. Its tax rate will be 15 percent compared with Allergan's current rate of about 26 percent.Actavis was advised by JPMorgan and law firm Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton.

367,"   By Danielle Robinson  NEW YORK, Nov 17 (IFR) - Actavis will issue around US$27.5bn of new debt to finance its US$66bn acquisition of Botox-maker Allergan, but about half of it will be short-dated to help the company keep its investment-grade ratings.The acquisition will send the combined company's gross debt leverage multiples to around 4.8 times,according to Fitch, in excess of what it would usually tolerate for a company it rates BBB-.Both Moody's and Fitch said they would not downgrade Actavis to junk despite the increased debt, believing strong cash flow will enable it to bring leverage back down fairly quickly.In a move to preserve its investment-grade status, Actavis also said it would issue around US$9bn of new equity and mandatory convertible preferred shares, as well as US$28bn of new equity to Allergan shareholders to finance the deal.""Strong free cash flow will enable us to de-lever quickly to below 3.5 times debt to adjusted Ebitda within 12 months after close,"" Actavis CEO Brent Saunders told analysts on a conference call on Monday after the deal was announced.""We expect to maintain our investment-grade rating following the close of this transaction."" Todd Joyce, the CFO, said around US$5bn of the new debt would be a short-dated term loan facility, and US$10bn of it short-term bonds of less than five years in duration. The remaining US$12.5bn of debt will have a maturity of longer than five years.BETTER THAN EXPECTED The prospect of a such a deluge of bonds still sent Actavis spreads about 20bp wider, with its 3.85% 2024s spotted at 210bp over Treasuries mid-morning from a 190bp close on Friday. Analysts nevertheless said the financing package overall was better than expected from a credit standpoint.""Actavis management had previously indicated that in those very rare circumstances where it found a transformational asset worth pursuing, that it would consider taking its leverage ratio to 5.0-5.5x to exploit the exceedingly low interest rate environment,"" wrote Cowen and Company equity analysts.Joyce said keeping the investment-grade rating drove the capital structure of the combined organization. ""Investment-grade ratings are incredibly important to us, because it really allows us the flexibility longer term to finance our business at very attractive rates,"" he said.The average weighted interest cost on the new debt financing is expected to be around 4.25%.""We laid out a range of options to the rating agencies and then agreed with them not only on the amount of equity versus debt that we were going to issue in connection with the transaction, but also (that) ... we look to ladder the new debt and the maturity schedule for those new borrowings.""JP Morgan, Mizuho and Wells Fargo have provided the underwriting commitment.The acquisition puts an end to a hostile bid by activist investor William Ackman and Valeant Pharmaceuticals International.The offer values Allergan at $219 per share and is US$6bn more than the price Valeant had last offered to pay.

Downbeat Chinese home prices data also dampened sentiment. Hong Kong's Hang Seng shed 0.9 percent and the Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.7 percent.Tokyo's Nikkei, in contrast, rose sharply as the market waited to see if Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will call a snap election, delay a sales tax increase that had been planned for October next year, and consider further economic stimulus.The Nikkei gained 2.2 percent, erasing much of Monday's 3 percent fall suffered when shock data showed Japan had slipped into recession.If he does call an election, Abe will hope his ruling Liberal Democrat Party (LDP) will trounce a weak opposition to reaffirm its mandate to pursue reflationary economic policies. ""While there has been some decline in the support rate for  Abe's cabinet there has been no accompanying rise in the support for the opposition from the depressed level. We would therefore expect the main ruling LDP to maintain its majority and for Abenomics to continue,"" said Miyuki Kashima, managing director at BNY Mellon Asset Management. ""As a result, our positive view on the (Tokyo share) market remains unchanged.""Investors sold the euro on prospects of further easing by the European Central Bank, preferring to hold dollars as the U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to raise rates next year.ECB President Mario Draghi said the central bank was ready to provide further stimulus if its current efforts are not sufficient to accelerate the region's recovery, adding such new measures could include purchases of sovereign bonds. The euro was down 0.2 percent at $1.2473, pulling further away from a 2 1/2-week high of $1.2580 hit the previous day.The dollar traded little changed at 116.605 yen, near a seven-year high of 117.06 struck in the wake of Monday's shocking GDP data.The Australian dollar rained on expectations that it will benefit from investors turning away from the euro zone and Japan in search of higher yields. The Aussie rose 0.1 percent to $0.8719.""I see a risk for the AUD/USD to be squeezed higher because of capital flows into Australia,"" said Greg Gibbs, a strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland in Singapore.Gold lost momentum on the dollar's strength, trading at $1,188.20, off a 2 1/2-week high of $1,193.95 hit on Monday.Oil prices sagged as recession in Japan, the world's fourth largest crude importer, added to oversupply worries. But prices managed to hover above four-year lows as Russia and Venezuela appeared to be coordinating a price defence plan.U.S. crude futures were down 44 cents at $75.20 per barrel  but off Friday's four-year low of $73.25.

375,"   By Svea Herbst-Bayliss | NEW YORK  NEW YORK After months of fending off a hostile bid, Allergan Inc (AGN.N) Chief Executive David Pyott made the right call in selling to rival Actavis Plc ACT.N, whose stock price could nearly double in the next two years, a prominent investor said on Wednesday.Pyott ""did sell to the right company and we thought this was the right outcome,"" hedge fund manager Aaron Cowen said at the Reuters Global Investment Outlook Summit about the year's biggest pharmaceutical deal.Actavis will pay $219 a share for Allergan. Cowen said the company will be so attractive in the future that its share price could hit $400 in 12 to 24 months.Cowen's $1.25 billion Suvretta Capital owned 392,000 shares of Allergan at the end of the third quarter, according to a regulatory filing in which the New York-based fund also said it owned 247,500 shares of Actavis.Botox-maker Allergan on Monday agreed to sell itself to Actavis for $66 billion, in a deal that came in far above the offer that rival Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX.TO) and hedge fund manager William Ackman had been making since the end of April. Ackman, whose Pershing Square Capital Management hedge fund is Allergan's biggest investor with a nearly 10 percent stake, had been highly critical of Pyott and his board, saying they failed shareholders by steadfastly rejecting the Valeant deal.Cowen said Pyott had missed the fact that Allergan's balance sheet was inefficient and he failed to take advantage of tax arbitrage. ""When you have a profitable business, fat margin costs can creep in,"" Cowen said. Valeant planned deep cost cuts.Ackman's relentless push for Allergan to sell itself helped pave the way for a rival bidder to appear. Allergan's share price surged to $212.54, nearly doubling since January. ""We owned Allergan before Ackman got involved but we welcomed his activism,"" said Cowen, who worked at Soros Fund Management and SAC Capital Advisors before launching his fund.Actavis' share price has climbed 57.9 percent to $265.05 since January. Low interest rates are helping fuel the current mergers and acquisition boom, and Cowen expects the pace of consolidation to pick up next year.

At the end of the third quarter Ackman's $18 billion fund owned 28.87 million Allergan shares, a regulatory filing showed.While this isn't the deal the activist investor originally wanted - he had been pushing since April for rival Valeant buy Allergan - it will be lucrative all the same. ""If we hold the shares until transaction closure, we will receive $3.4 billion in cash and 9.81 million shares of Actavis worth $2.6 billion at current value,"" the letter said.Currently Pershing Square's stake is worth $5.64 billion and the stock was trading at a $15.70 discount to the transaction value, which translates into about a 19 percent annualized return assuming the deal closes next April.Ackman's firm is having one of its best years ever with a 35 percent gain for the year through the end of October.

Speculation has mounted recently over what Ackman planned to do with his holding, especially after he announced a stake in animal health company Zoetis Inc two weeks ago. Sounding a conciliatory note, Ackman said he now supports the Actavis deal and said his team had been impressed with Actavis Chief Executive Officer Brent Saunders and his business plan for the combined company after a recent meeting. In terms of other investments, Ackman said he still likes his short bet against Herbalife Ltd, which he disclosed publicly for the first time two years ago, and said it paid off well during the third quarter when it added 3.2 percent to the fund's performance.He also said he still likes the investment in mortgage companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac but cautioned that litigation will likely drag on for some time and that he has committed about 3 percent of the firm's capital to the bets.

384,"   By Caroline Humer and Olivia Oran | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Allergan Inc (AGN.N) Chief Executive David Pyott is close to joining the board of directors of Actavis Plc ACT.N, which reached a deal to buy the Botox-maker for $66 billion in November, three people familiar with the matter said on Thursday.Actavis CEO Brent Saunders is trying to recruit Pyott to join the board and is working through corporate governance issues, the people said, asking not to be named because the matter is private.They said Saunders described the plan at a small meeting with shareholders during the J.P. Morgan Healthcare conference in San Francisco this week. One investor who attended the meeting told Reuters that adding Pyott to the board could lend more credibility to Actavis's efforts to integrate Allergan into its operations.Actavis said in November that two members of the Allergan board would be invited to join the board of the combined company, but did not specify what Pyott's new role would be. If Pyott were to join the Actavis board, he would be considered a non-independent board member because of his ties to the acquired company, bringing the number of non-independent board members at Actavis to three. They include Saunders and Executive Chairman Paul Bisaro.While proxy advisory firms like ISS do not have guidelines on the precise number of non-independent directors they like to see on a board, outsiders typically view a board more favorably if it has fewer non-independent directors. Actavis said in December it would replace the majority of Allergan's top executives once the deal closes, with the exception of Allergan president Doug Ingram who will serve as a special adviser to Saunders.The deal, which thwarted a seven months-long hostile attempt by Valeant Pharmaceuticals Inc (VRX.TO) to buy Allergan, is expected to close in the second quarter of this year. Officials for Actavis and Allergan declined to comment.

393,"   By Svea Herbst-Bayliss | BOSTON  BOSTON Billionaire investor William Ackman has purchased a five percent stake in Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX.TO) (VRX.N), his hedge fund said on Monday, making him the Canadian drug company's fifth-largest stakeholder.Ackman's $20 billion Pershing Square Capital Management hedge fund began building up the $3.3 billion stake, only months after its vocal effort to help Valeant buy Botox-maker Allergan (AGN.N) failed, a source familiar with the investment told Reuters.The source, who asked not to be named, said the fund would take a passive approach to Valeant, instead of pressuring it to change management or pursue strategic options, as it does with most of its investments.Valeant spokeswoman Laurie Little said ""we have a good working relationship with Pershing Square and welcome them as shareholders.""Valeant shares were up nearly 2.5 percent at $203.64 on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday. The drug maker's Toronto-listed shares gained about 2.4 percent to C$256.52. Known as one of corporate America's noisiest agitators, Ackman was the top performer in the realm of large hedge fund managers last year with a 40 percent return. His Pershing Square has notched big wins at railway firm Canadian Pacific (CP.TO) and shopping mall operator General Growth Properties (GGP.N), and also made money with its Allergan stake.Valeant sought Ackman's help in early 2014 to buy Allergan, leaving the hedge fund to spend roughly $4 billion to build its 9.7 percent stake in the Botox-maker. But Allergan rejected Valeant's overtures, sued the hedge fund and instead sold itself to rival Actavis in November.While working with Valeant on the takeover bid, Ackman could not buy Valeant shares. All restrictions fell away when the deal fell through, leaving him able to buy in, paying just under $200 per share initially, the source said. Last month, Valeant bought Salix Pharmaceuticals for $14.5 billion, pushing its share price up further. Some investment industry sources had speculated that Ackman would press for a deal between Valeant and animal health company Zoetis (ZTS.N), in which Ackman has a $2 billion stake and a Pershing Square partner on the board. But the source said Pershing Square would take a passive approach because Ackman had faith in Valeant's management, including its chief executive officer, Michael Pearson, who has slashed costs, cut the company's tax rate by moving it to  Canada and turned it into a serial acquirer during his seven years as CEO.Pershing Square confirmed on Monday that its various funds had bought more than 16.4 million shares of Valeant, representing 4.9 percent of the company. It said that Valeant now made up 16.9 percent of Pershing Square Holdings (PSH.AS), a fund that was publicly listed last year. The options on the U.S.-listed shares of Valeant were unusually busy over the last two weeks with average daily volume of about 15,000 contracts, more than twice the average for the last 200 days, according to Trade Alert data. Bets on the shares rising above $210 by April 17 were the most active with more than 16,000 contracts traded over the last two weeks.

403,"   By Ben Hirschler | LONDON  LONDON Eli Lilly has won a patent case in the Court of Appeal in London over its blockbuster Alimta lung cancer drug, boosting prospects for future sales and dealing a blow to generic challenger Actavis, now renamed Allergan.Alimta generated worldwide sales of $2.79 billion for Lilly last year, making the medicine its biggest-selling product. Shares in the U.S. drugmaker jumped 5 percent on Thursday.The verdict, which reverses a 2014 decision by the English High Court, will also apply to France, Italy and Spain under a legal system of corresponding declarations.The London appeals court ruled Actavis's plan to market certain alternative salt forms of Alimta -- known generically as pemetrexed -- after the basic patent on the medicine expires in December 2015 would indirectly infringe another Lilly patent.The additional patent is valid to 2021 and covers the administration of two nutrients, folic acid and vitamin B12, that are given to patients before and while they receive Alimta to prevent side effects. Lilly said that the latest ruling ""increases the likelihood that the vitamin regimen patents for Alimta will provide exclusivity in the UK, France, Italy and Spain through June 2021"". Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson estimated Alimta sales in the four countries totaled between $400 million and $500 million in 2014, and the drug's high margins meant continuing revenue streams to 2021 would boost earnings per share (EPS)significantly.""By our estimate, this could boost Lilly’s EPS by nearly 10 percent annually from 2016 to 2020,"" he wrote in a note.   Analysts at Cowen also increased earnings estimates for the company and raised their price target for the stock to $90 from $85. Lilly shares have enjoyed a strong run recently on growing hopes for its experimental drug solanezumab, an Alzheimer's disease treatment once considered a dud.Litigation over Alimta patents is continuing in the United States, where the consensus view is currently that Lilly is likely to prevail. In Germany, by contrast, the argument has gone against Lilly, following a decision in March by an appeal court there that Actavis would not infringe Lilly's patent if it sold its product after December 2015.

404,"  * Data enhances chances of takeover - stakeholder, analysts* Drug expected to be blockbuster - stakeholder, analysts* Shares rise 50 pct to record high   (Adds analyst, fund manager and executive comments; updates shares)By Vidya L Nathan and Natalie GroverJuly 13 Anacor Pharmaceuticals Inc's  experimental skin ointment succeeded in late-stage studies, taking the drugmaker a step closer to having a potential blockbuster in its portfolio and raising expectations that it could be taken over.The company's shares, which have more than quadrupled in the past year up to Friday's close, rose more than 50 percent on Monday to a life high of $127.19.""Personally, I'd love to see Anacor independent a little bit longer, but I don't think its going to happen,"" said Paul Yook, portfolio manager at BioShares Biotechnology Funds, which holds a stake in the drugmaker. Analysts said they expected the ointment to eclipse $1 billion in sales and potentially be prescribed as a first-line treatment for atopic dermatitis, an unsightly skin condition characterized by itchiness and inflammation.That could make Anacor an attractive target.Potential bidders could include Novartis AG, Allergan Plc and Japan's Astellas Pharma Inc, among others, Yook said.Yook said he expected any offer for Anacor to be at a per share premium of 50-90 percent. That compares with the 23.5 percent premium Allergan agreed to pay for Kythera Biopharmaceuticals Inc and its double-chin product in a $2.1 billion deal in June.Anacor represents the ""holy grail of biotech company investment,"" Yook said, pointing to the company's robust portfolio, including the potential blockbuster skin ointment that Anacor is developing without a partner.The ointment, Crisaborole, cleared two late-stage studies testing it for use in atopic dermatitis and was successful in both children and adults, the company said. Atopic dermatitis affects about 18-25 million people in the United States, mostly infants and children, Anacor said.Existing treatments include topical cortical steroids, which can weaken skin, and non-steroidal treatments, such as Novartis AG's Elidel and Astellas Pharma US Inc's  Protopic, which have been linked with cancer.Other companies developing treatments for atopic dermatitis include Oculus Innovative Sciences Inc, Pfizer Inc , Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc, and Celsus Therapeutics Plc.Palo Alto, California-based Anacor said it expects to submit a marketing application for the drug in the first half of 2016.Wedbush Securities's David Nierengarten said Crisaborole's safety and efficacy profile would make it the best product in its class.Shares of the company, which is also testing Crisaborole for psoriasis, were up 48.4 percent at $125.60 on Monday, making them the top percentage gainer on the Nasdaq.

411,"   By Tova Cohen and Ari Rabinovitch | TEL AVIV, July 26  TEL AVIV, July 26 After months of sparring in a hostile takeover bid for rival Mylan NV, Teva Pharmaceutical's move to buy Allergan Plc's  generic drug business instead could be a smoother ride that will bring bigger returns, faster.Israel-based Teva, the world's largest generic drugmaker, is in advanced talks to buy Allergan's generic drugs unit for between $40-45 billion dollars, according to a person familiar with the matter.News of the deal broke on Saturday after Teva's $40 billion bid for Mylan hit a snag when a Dutch foundation linked to Mylan bought temporary control of half the company in an attempt to block the takeover.A Teva spokesman declined to comment on possible talks with Allergan.Though the Teva-Mylan feud has hogged the industry spotlight since April, Allergan' generics business may actually have been Teva's first choice. Teva CEO Erez Vigodman is believed to have approached Allergan last year, which was called Actavis prior to a March merger.In June 2014, just a few months after joining the company himself, Vigodman hired the former head of Actavis' generic drug business, Sigurdur Olafsson, to fill a similar role at Teva. ""There was previously a preference for Actavis over Mylan but for some reason it didn't materialise,"" said Bank of Jerusalem analyst Jonathan Kreizman.Should the deal with Dublin-based Allergan now go through, there will be two big upsides for Teva, he said.First, there is less overlap than with Mylan. Teva has been planning a generic version of Mylan's EpiPen, a billion-dollar product, while Mylan has been working on a generic version of Teva's best-selling multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone. In the short term, Teva would benefit from removing the uncertainty over the outcome of the Mylan deal that has weighed on its stock.Since hitting a year high of $68.74 in New York on April 9, just before speculation on a possible Mylan bid had surfaced, Teva shares are down more than 10 percent, closing on Friday at $61.85.Kreizman said he assumes the size of the deal would be similar in scope to Mylan, noting Allergan has about 8 percent of the U.S. drugs market, compared with 9 percent for Mylan and 14 percent for Teva. ""Assuming the entity is more or less the same size, valuation is less of an issue,"" he said.The Mylan deal is hard for the market to digest, he said, while ""any friendly transaction ... would have better impact.""Allergan's generics operations has about $7 billion in sales, said Umer Raffat, an analyst with investment research firm ISI Group.""Theoretically, a Teva/Allergan generics business combo offers Teva the opportunity to get what it was looking for without having to go through Dutch courts,"" he said.This includes boosting its scale and getting access to complex generics like injectables as well as biosimilar drugs through Allergan's partnership with Amgen on oncology biologic drugs, he said.

412,"   By Greg Roumeliotis  Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (TEVA.TA) is in advanced talks to buy Allergan Plc's (AGN.N) generic drug business following a thus far unsuccessful effort to acquire peer Mylan NV (MYL.O), according to a person familiar with the matter.Jerusalem-based Teva, which has offered to buy Mylan for $40 billion, is now close to an agreement to acquire Dublin-based Allergan's generic drugs unit for between $40 billion and $45 billion, the person said on Saturday.A deal could be announced as early as next week, the person said, cautioning that negotiations had not yet been completed and asking not to be identified because the discussions are confidential. Teva and Allergan representatives did not respond to requests for comment.Large drug makers are trying to realign their operations to focus on a small number of leading businesses, while smaller specialty and generic producers are seeking larger scale. Allergan's branded drugs business makes products such as Botox and Alzheimer's drug Namenda. Its generics business makes up about a third of the company's total revenue. A successful deal with Allergan would give Teva, which has a market capitalization of $60 billion, a much bigger footprint in the generic drugs sector.

413,"  (Updates sourcing, adds details)By Greg RoumeliotisJuly 25 Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd  is in advanced talks to buy Allergan Plc's  generic drug business following a thus far unsuccessful effort to acquire peer Mylan NV, according to a person familiar with the matter.Jerusalem-based Teva, which has offered to buy Mylan for $40 billion, is now close to an agreement to acquire Dublin-based Allergan's generic drugs unit for between $40 billion and $45 billion, the person said on Saturday.A deal could be announced as early as next week, the person said, cautioning that negotiations had not yet been completed and asking not to be identified because the discussions are confidential. Teva and Allergan representatives did not respond to requests for comment. Large drug makers are trying to realign their operations to focus on a small number of leading businesses, while smaller specialty and generic producers are seeking larger scale. Allergan's branded drugs business makes products such as Botox and Alzheimer's drug Namenda. Its generics business makes up about a third of the company's total revenue.A successful deal with Allergan would give Teva, which has a market capitalization of $60 billion, a much bigger footprint in the generic drugs sector. It would also offer opportunities for significant cost synergies and tax savings.

414,"   By Tova Cohen and Steven Scheer | TEL AVIV  TEL AVIV Israel's Teva Pharmaceutical Industries will pay $40.5 billion in cash and stock for Allergan's generic drugs business, solidifying Teva's position as the world's No. 1 maker of generics while freeing Allergan to focus on branded drugs, paying down debt and potential ""transformational"" acquisitions.The deal, the largest in Israel's corporate history, allows Teva stronger economies of scale, crucial in the low-margin generic drugs business. Teva , which dropped its hostile pursuit of Mylan, will likely have to sell off some drugs to allay antitrust concerns.""Allergan's business is more high-end (than Mylan). It's a more interesting business ... a profitable business and it's well managed,"" said Gilad Alper, an analyst at brokerage Excellence Nessuah.Allergan, known for its Botox anti-wrinkle treatment, became the third-largest generic drugmaker in the United States after combining with Actavis in March.

416,"   By Caroline Humer | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Allergan plc CEO Brent Saunders is ready to put the $36 billion his company will net from the sale of its generics business to Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd to work, possibly with another large, ""transformational"" merger.The readiness for a new transaction just after the Teva deal was announced on Monday represents what Saunders calls a strategy to remain nimble and open to opportunity as the healthcare sector remakes itself.Saunders has already shown a penchant for quick deal-making. Just last year, he helped orchestrate the $25 billion sale of Forest Laboratories Inc, where he was CEO, to Actavis Plc.As head of Actavis, he then sealed a $66 billion purchase of Botox-maker Allergan, beating out rival suitor Valeant Pharmaceuticals and its acquisition partner, hedge fund billionaire William Ackman.The latest deal had just closed in March and Saunders was busy integrating the two companies under the Allergan name. At the time, he did not consider unloading the generics assets of Actavis.""While I had a different strategy a few months ago, the thing that sets us apart ... is our strategy to be nimble,"" Saunders said in an interview. Saunders now plans to use the proceeds from its $40.5 billion asset sale to Teva to increase the size of existing drug businesses, expand into new therapy areas and pursue larger deals. He declined to discuss any specific targets, a list Wall Street that analysts speculated may include Biogen Inc, AbbVie Inc and Amgen Inc. ""Clearly we are watching many companies - we have been for some time - but what has changed is our timeline for being able to execute has accelerated, if the opportunity presents itself,"" Saunders said.The $40.5 billion cash-and-stock sale of generic drugs business to Teva is expected to close in the first quarter of 2016. That will essentially ""reload"" Allergan's balance sheet for more acquisitions, Saunders added. When asked if Allergan planned to spend the cash within 18 months, he replied that the company would, as long as it could maintain its investment-grade credit rating. CONSOLIDATION AHEAD Saunders said his change of direction for Allergan came only a few weeks ago when Teva CEO Erez Vigodman called to make an offer. Vigodman had already approached Actavis earlier in the year, but the company was not interested at that time.""To be fair, I didn't think it was a good idea to sell it until Erez called me and put a compelling offer on the table,"" Saunders said. ""It caused me to step back and think about the industry and the dynamics.""The healthcare industry has consolidated in the past year, with pharmacies and distributors aligning through merger deals or purchasing agreements that give them more leverage over prices for generic drugs. These deals, such as CVS Health's purchases of Target Corp's pharmacies and the Omnicare specialty pharmacies and distributor McKesson Corp's purchasing agreement with pharmacy Rite Aid Corp, will force more consolidation among generics makers so they can compete, Saunders said.Two of the largest U.S. health insurers - Humana Inc and Cigna Corp - have also agreed to be bought in the past month, signaling fresh pressure on prices, Saunders said.Of the seven main therapeutic areas that Allergan will focus on after the generics sale, he said there are four with the strongest opportunities in terms of unmet medical care: aesthetics, eye care, central nervous system therapies and gastrointestinal therapies.Les Funtleyder, healthcare portfolio manager for E Squared Asset Management, which owns Allergan shares, said Saunders should look for something with a reasonable risk versus reward profile.""If it were my $40 billion, I would probably do four or five deals in the $10 billion range, aiming for late-stage drug programs where you have some idea if the drug works,"" Funtleyder said.

430,"   By Ransdell Pierson  Aug 6 Allergan, which is selling its generics business to focus on branded drugs and aesthetics products, aims to acquire or license products that have already shown promise in studies, and leave the riskier discovery process to small biotechs and academic researchers.""The best way for us to participate in discovery is investing in a more 'virtual' sense, than actually building and running our own labs,"" company Chief Executive Brent Saunders said in an interview after Allergan reported second-quarter results on Thursday.Dublin-based drugmaker Actavis in March acquired Allergan, best known for its Botox anti-wrinkle treatment and eye medicines, and took the Allergan name.Last week, in another major reshaping, Allergan agreed to sell its generics to Israel's Teva Pharmaceutical Industries  for $40.5 billion. That would leave Allergan with an array of prescription drugs and aesthetics products with far higher profit margins than generics.Saunders said discovery research, where researchers test ideas and compounds in test tubes and animals, typically eats up about 30 percent of pharmaceutical company research budgets, although only about one of every 20 such products that enters human trials succeeds and is approved. ""Discovery is where the industry has its lowest return on investment,"" he said, ""and not a good (use) of Allergan's research dollars.""Instead, he said Allergan will acquire products from companies that have already done the research spadework, and then itself develop the medicines and submit them for regulatory approvals. ""The quality of the science and leadership in these smaller biotechs has improved vastly over the last few years and there is a whole ecosystem of discovery that we can tap into via partnerships, collaborations and mergers and acquisitions,"" Saunders said.Allergan has almost 1,400 scientists at its research sites in California and in New Jersey, following about 200 layoffs since the Actavis/Allergan merger.There is no shame in them harnessing the ideas and inventions of others, he said, pointing out that Gilead Sciences Inc and Celgene Corp have spun life-saving drugs and commercial riches from the same formula - Gilead in its treatments for hepatitis C and Celgene from its oncology drugs. ""They are often admired as some of the most innovative and forward-looking biotech companies, and they deploy the same model we do.""(Reporting by Ransdell Pierson; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)",2015-08-06,AGN,"Thu Aug 6, 2015 | 5:41pm EDT",Allergan CEO says better to leave discoveries to others,http://www.reuters.com//article/allergan-medicine-idUSL1N10H3EO20150806?type=companyNews

449,"   By Bill Berkrot and Ransdell Pierson  Pfizer Inc, the No. 1 U.S. drugmaker, and Botox maker Allergan Plc said they were in friendly talks to create a pharmaceutical colossus but the prospect that the company would seek to avoid U.S. taxes sounded political alarm bells.Both New York-based Pfizer and Dublin-based Allergan said no agreement has been reached and declined to discuss any terms of the deal, which would potentially set up Pfizer to take advantage of Ireland's lower tax rates.Allergan shares rose 6 percent to $304.38 in U.S. trading, while Pfizer closed off 1.9 percent at $34.77.Pfizer is already facing political pushback at home that is only likely to intensify with the U.S. presidential campaign underway, as candidates take aim at high prescription drug prices and companies looking to avoid paying U.S. taxes.A spokesman for Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton said the candidate had not seen details of the proposed merger, but is against tax inversion maneuvers, in which U.S. companies relocate overseas to take advantage of lower tax rates.""Clinton is committed to cracking down on so-called 'inversions,' where a company chooses to leave the U.S. on paper to game the tax system, and believes we should reform our tax code to encourage investment in the U.S., rather than shipping earnings and jobs overseas,"" Clinton spokesman Ian Sams said.Democratic U.S. Senator Charles Schumer of New York said in a statement: ""The continued pursuit of inversions, mergers and foreign acquisitions of major U.S. companies for purely tax purposes shows there is a lot more work to be done to stop them.""From the right, developer and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said the deal was a reminder that the U.S. tax code needed an overhaul.SMOOTHER PATH ""These corporate inversions take capital and, more importantly, jobs offshore,"" he said in a statement. ""We need leadership in Washington to get the tax code changed so companies will be coming to America, not looking for ways to leave."" Billionaire investor Carl Icahn, who has endorsed Trump and launched a $150 million political action committee advocating tax reform to eliminate inversions, said a Pfizer-Allergan deal would result in the loss of the country's 10th largest company to Ireland. Analysts speculated a deal could be all or primarily done with stock because under new U.S. rules aimed at curtailing tax inversions, shareholders of the overseas company must own at least 40 percent of the combined entity.Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan suggested a price of $390 per Allergan share, funded by equity and debt. Allergan's U.S.-traded shares soared as high as $316.80 on Thursday.Earlier Thursday before the companies confirmed the talks, Pfizer Chief Executive Officer Ian Read reiterated his criticism of U.S. corporate taxes.""Our tax rate highly disadvantages American multinational high-tech businesses,"" Read said at a Wall Street Journal event. ""I am fighting with one hand tied behind my back.""Pfizer's effective tax rate is 25 percent, while Allergan's is 15 percent.Given that both sides characterized the talks as ""friendly,"" Pfizer is likely to have a much smoother path outside of the United States after running into intense political opposition in Britain and from AstraZeneca Plc's board in its failed, unsolicited bid last year.""It's definitely a far easier target for Pfizer than AstraZeneca,"" said Christophe Eggmann, investment director at GAM, who holds shares in both companies. ""The hurdle will really be the price."" Moody's Investor Service said the deal would have ""credit positive implications for both companies.""A tax inversion is being discussed in the current talks, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters. In its pursuit of AstraZeneca, Pfizer had hoped to employ such a strategy. Read said Thursday he was open to any moves that produce the best long-term value for the company and shareholders. He said he was looking at various growth strategies, including a deal. Pfizer is expected to decide by late next year whether to sell or spin off its older, off-patent products unit to pare the business and focus on innovative, patent-protected medicines.Allergan, the product of a recent merger with generic drugmaker Actavis, is selling a large portfolio of generic medicines to Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd for $40.5 billion.  CASH FROM BOTOX A purchase of Allergan, with a market value of more than $113 billion, would be the biggest in Pfizer's long history of huge deals, eclipsing the $90 billion Warner-Lambert acquisition through which it gained control of Lipitor, once the world's top-selling medicine.It would also restore the Viagra maker as the world's largest pharmaceutical company, worth about $330 billion, a position it relinquished after Lipitor went off-patent.Allergan expects revenue of more than $8 billion in the second half of 2015, not including generic drugs it is selling to Teva.Pfizer has annual sales of about $48 billion, with about $27 billion from patent-protected drugs, consumer products and vaccines, and about $21 billion from the business it is considering selling.Since the Warner-Lambert purchase, Pfizer has acquired Pharmacia and Wyeth, each deal under a different CEO.The deals have led to many thousands of job cuts. It is not known how many cuts would result from a tie-up with Allergan.Apart from the tax considerations, the deal would give Pfizer access to Allergan's wrinkle treatment Botox, with $2.4 billion in annual sales, and its $1.3 billion Restasis dry eye treatment.By Sept. 10, deal-making in all sectors of healthcare this year had reached a record $447.5 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data.Other large pending tie-ups include pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc's planned purchase of smaller rival Rite Aid Corp announced this week, and pending mergers of health insurers Aetna Inc with Humana Inc, and Anthem Inc with Cigna Corp.

450,"   By David Lawder | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Pfizer Inc faces political risks in Washington if it proceeds with a bid for Allergan, but with little chance of legislation to curb such tax inversion deals, the Obama administration may be able to throw up only limited obstacles.Lawmakers are widely seen as unlikely to tackle major tax code changes before the 2016 presidential election, but they were already scolding Pfizer publicly on Thursday, showing that companies considering inversion deals do face reputational risk. ""When corporations choose to invert and don’t pay their fair share of taxes, they leave the rest of us to pick up the tab. That isn't right,"" said Democratic Senator Richard Durbin in a statement. Durbin has voiced similar views on prior inversions, including one that was abandoned by retailer Walgreen.An inversion deal typically involves a U.S. company buying a foreign company and then relocating corporate headquarters, on paper at least, to the foreign company's home country, with the goal of reducing the combined company's overall taxes.New York-based Pfizer and Dublin-based Allergan said they have not reached an agreement and declined to give details. A tax inversion is being discussed in the current talks, which could create the world's largest drugmaker, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters.Ireland has been a frequent redomiciling destination for U.S. corporations fleeing the U.S. tax system, though most of them leave their actual core operations in the United States.The latest wave of inversions crested in late 2014, when the Obama administration cracked down, making it harder both to do the deals and to realize their benefits.  A U.S. Treasury Department spokesperson said further actions could be taken, but stressed that only Congress can slam the door completely.Among the department's options is tightening rules against a tax-dodging technique known as ""earnings stripping"" that is often a key component of inversions. This practice involves shifting profits earned in the United States to a lower-tax jurisdiction. ""We are continuing our review of a broad range of options for further action but there is a limit to what we can do administratively. Congress must take action to end this loophole‎,"" the Treasury spokesperson said in a statement.Steven Rosenthal, senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, a think tank, agreed that earnings stripping was a good place for the Treasury to start.""Otherwise you leave a loophole and incentive for these combinations to continue,"" he said.

New York-based Pfizer and Dublin-based Allergan said they have not reached an agreement and declined to give details.A tax inversion is being discussed in the current talks, which could create the world's largest drugmaker, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters.Ireland has been a frequent redomiciling destination for U.S. corporations fleeing the U.S. tax system, though most of them leave their actual core operations in the United States. The latest wave of inversions crested in late 2014, when the Obama administration cracked down, making it harder both to do the deals and to realize their benefits.A U.S. Treasury Department spokesperson said further actions could be taken, but stressed that only Congress can slam the door completely. Among the department's options is tightening rules against a tax-dodging technique known as ""earnings stripping"" that is often a key component of inversions. This practice involves shifting profits earned in the United States to a lower-tax jurisdiction.""We are continuing our review of a broad range of options for further action but there is a limit to what we can do administratively. Congress must take action to end this loophole,"" the Treasury spokesperson said in a statement.Steven Rosenthal, senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, a think tank, agreed that earnings stripping was a good place for the Treasury to start.""Otherwise you leave a loophole and incentive for these combinations to continue,"" he said.

453,"  (Adds Hillary Clinton comment, updates shares)By Bill Berkrot and Ransdell PiersonOct 29 Pfizer Inc, the No. 1 U.S. drugmaker, and Botox maker Allergan Plc said they were in friendly talks to create a pharmaceutical colossus but the prospect that the company would seek to avoid U.S. taxes sounded political alarm bells.Both New York-based Pfizer and Dublin-based Allergan said no agreement has been reached and declined to discuss any terms of the deal, which would potentially set up Pfizer to take advantage of Ireland's lower tax rates.Allergan shares rose 6 percent to $304.38 in U.S. trading, while Pfizer closed off 1.9 percent at $34.77.Pfizer is already facing political pushback at home that is only likely to intensify with the U.S. presidential campaign underway, as candidates take aim at high prescription drug prices and companies looking to avoid paying U.S. taxes.A spokesman for Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton said the candidate had not seen details of the proposed merger, but is against tax inversion maneuvers, in which U.S. companies relocate overseas to take advantage of lower tax rates.""Clinton is committed to cracking down on so-called 'inversions,' where a company chooses to leave the U.S. on paper to game the tax system, and believes we should reform our tax code to encourage investment in the U.S., rather than shipping earnings and jobs overseas,"" Clinton spokesman Ian Sams said.Democratic U.S. Senator Charles Schumer of New York said in a statement: ""The continued pursuit of inversions, mergers and foreign acquisitions of major U.S. companies for purely tax purposes shows there is a lot more work to be done to stop them.""From the right, developer and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said the deal was a reminder that the U.S. tax code needed an overhaul.SMOOTHER PATH ""These corporate inversions take capital and, more importantly, jobs offshore,"" he said in a statement. ""We need leadership in Washington to get the tax code changed so companies will be coming to America, not looking for ways to leave."" Billionaire investor Carl Icahn, who has endorsed Trump and launched a $150 million political action committee advocating tax reform to eliminate inversions, said a Pfizer-Allergan deal would result in the loss of the country's 10th largest company to Ireland.Analysts speculated a deal could be all or primarily done with stock because under new U.S. rules aimed at curtailing tax inversions, shareholders of the overseas company must own at least 40 percent of the combined entity.Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan suggested a price of $390 per Allergan share, funded by equity and debt. Allergan's U.S.-traded shares soared as high as $316.80 on Thursday.Earlier Thursday before the companies confirmed the talks, Pfizer Chief Executive Officer Ian Read reiterated his criticism of U.S. corporate taxes.""Our tax rate highly disadvantages American multinational high-tech businesses,"" Read said at a Wall Street Journal event. ""I am fighting with one hand tied behind my back.""Pfizer's effective tax rate is 25 percent, while Allergan's is 15 percent. Given that both sides characterized the talks as ""friendly,"" Pfizer is likely to have a much smoother path outside of the United States after running into intense political opposition in Britain and from AstraZeneca Plc's  board in its failed, unsolicited bid last year.""It's definitely a far easier target for Pfizer than AstraZeneca,"" said Christophe Eggmann, investment director at GAM, who holds shares in both companies. ""The hurdle will really be the price.""Moody's Investor Service said the deal would have ""credit positive implications for both companies.""A tax inversion is being discussed in the current talks, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters. In its pursuit of AstraZeneca, Pfizer had hoped to employ such a strategy.Read said Thursday he was open to any moves that produce the best long-term value for the company and shareholders. He said he was looking at various growth strategies, including a deal.Pfizer is expected to decide by late next year whether to sell or spin off its older, off-patent products unit to pare the business and focus on innovative, patent-protected medicines. Allergan, the product of a recent merger with generic drugmaker Actavis, is selling a large portfolio of generic medicines to Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd   for $40.5 billion.CASH FROM BOTOX A purchase of Allergan, with a market value of more than $113 billion, would be the biggest in Pfizer's long history of huge deals, eclipsing the $90 billion Warner-Lambert acquisition through which it gained control of Lipitor, once the world's top-selling medicine.It would also restore the Viagra maker as the world's largest pharmaceutical company, worth about $330 billion, a position it relinquished after Lipitor went off-patent.Allergan expects revenue of more than $8 billion in the second half of 2015, not including generic drugs it is selling to Teva.Pfizer has annual sales of about $48 billion, with about $27 billion from patent-protected drugs, consumer products and vaccines, and about $21 billion from the business it is considering selling.Since the Warner-Lambert purchase, Pfizer has acquired Pharmacia and Wyeth, each deal under a different CEO.The deals have led to many thousands of job cuts. It is not known how many cuts would result from a tie-up with Allergan.Apart from the tax considerations, the deal would give Pfizer access to Allergan's wrinkle treatment Botox, with $2.4 billion in annual sales, and its $1.3 billion Restasis dry eye treatment.By Sept. 10, deal-making in all sectors of healthcare this year had reached a record $447.5 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data.Other large pending tie-ups include pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc's planned purchase of smaller rival Rite Aid Corp announced this week, and pending mergers of health insurers Aetna Inc with Humana Inc, and Anthem Inc with Cigna Corp.(Additional reporting by Gregory Roumeliotis and Caroline Humer in New York, Vidya L Nathan in Bengaluru, Ben Hirschler in London and Amanda Becker in Littleton, N.H.; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe and Christian Plumb)",2015-10-29,AGN,"Thu Oct 29, 2015 | 6:02pm EDT","UPDATE 5-Pfizer, Allergan drug merger talks raise tax hackles in U.S.",http://www.reuters.com//article/allergan-ma-pfizer-idUSL3N12T51K20151029?type=companyNews
454,"  (Adds Allergan CEO comment)By Jonathan StempelOct 29 Warner Chilcott US Sales LLC, now part of Botox maker Allergan Plc, agreed to plead guilty to felony healthcare fraud and pay $125 million to resolve U.S. charges that it paid kickbacks to doctors to induce them to prescribe several of its drugs.The U.S. Department of Justice, which announced the settlement, also said former Warner Chilcott President W. Carl Reichel was arrested in Boston on Thursday and charged with one count of conspiring to pay kickbacks.At least four other people have pleaded guilty or been charged over Warner Chilcott's activities, the department said.The settlement resolves charges that from 2009 to 2013, Warner Chilcott illegally marketed seven drugs, including Asacol to treat ulcerative colitis, and Actonel and Atelvia to treat post-menopausal osteoporosis. Investigators said this marketing included the making of payments or offering of perks such as expensive restaurant meals to persuade doctors to prescribe the drugs.Warner Chilcott agreed to pay a $22.94 million criminal fine and admit to paying kickbacks, improperly inducing insurers to pay for Atelvia prescriptions, and making unsubstantiated claims about Actonel.It also agreed to pay $102.06 million to the U.S. government and states to resolve civil charges that it caused false claims to be submitted to government healthcare programs. Allergan is based in Dublin, Ireland, and has offices in Parsippany, New Jersey. It said it cooperated with the U.S. probe and had previously set aside funds for the accord.Chief Executive Brent Saunders said in a statement that Allergan is committed to operating ""in full compliance with the regulations and high ethical standards we have set.""Reichel, 57, of Chester, New Jersey, pleaded not guilty at a hearing before U.S. Magistrate Judge Jennifer Boal in Boston, and was released without bail, said his lawyer Joe Savage. ""The charges brought today by the U.S. Attorney's office are false,"" said Savage, a partner at Goodwin Procter. ""For more than 30 years in the pharmaceutical industry, Carl Reichel worked hard and did the right thing, and these baseless claims can't change that.""Whistleblowers who sued Warner Chilcott under the federal False Claims Act in 2011 will receive $22.9 million from the civil settlement, the Justice Department said.Warner Chilcott was acquired by Actavis Plc in October 2013. Actavis bought Allergan in March 2015 and took its name.Also on Thursday, Allergan confirmed that it is in preliminary talks to merge with drugmaker Pfizer Inc.The cases are U.S. ex rel Alexander et al v.

459,"  (Repeats with no change to text)By David LawderWASHINGTON Oct 29 Pfizer Inc faces political risks in Washington if it proceeds with a bid for Allergan, but with little chance of legislation to curb such tax inversion deals, the Obama administration may be able to throw up only limited obstacles.Lawmakers are widely seen as unlikely to tackle major tax code changes before the 2016 presidential election, but they were already scolding Pfizer publicly on Thursday, showing that companies considering inversion deals do face reputational risk.""When corporations choose to invert and don't pay their fair share of taxes, they leave the rest of us to pick up the tab. That isn't right,"" said Democratic Senator Richard Durbin in a statement. Durbin has voiced similar views on prior inversions, including one that was abandoned by retailer Walgreen.An inversion deal typically involves a U.S. company buying a foreign company and then relocating corporate headquarters, on paper at least, to the foreign company's home country, with the goal of reducing the combined company's overall taxes. New York-based Pfizer and Dublin-based Allergan said they have not reached an agreement and declined to give details.A tax inversion is being discussed in the current talks, which could create the world's largest drugmaker, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters. Ireland has been a frequent redomiciling destination for U.S. corporations fleeing the U.S. tax system, though most of them leave their actual core operations in the United States.The latest wave of inversions crested in late 2014, when the Obama administration cracked down, making it harder both to do the deals and to realize their benefits.A U.S. Treasury Department spokesperson said further actions could be taken, but stressed that only Congress can slam the door completely. Among the department's options is tightening rules against a tax-dodging technique known as ""earnings stripping"" that is often a key component of inversions. This practice involves shifting profits earned in the United States to a lower-tax jurisdiction.""We are continuing our review of a broad range of options for further action but there is a limit to what we can do administratively.

460,"   By Bill Berkrot and Ransdell Pierson  Pfizer Inc, the No. 1 U.S. drugmaker, and Botox maker Allergan Plc said they were in friendly talks to create a pharmaceutical colossus but the prospect that the company would seek to avoid U.S. taxes sounded political alarm bells.Both New York-based Pfizer and Dublin-based Allergan said no agreement has been reached and declined to discuss any terms of the deal, which would potentially set up Pfizer to take advantage of Ireland's lower tax rates.Allergan shares rose 6 percent to $304.38 in U.S. trading, while Pfizer closed off 1.9 percent at $34.77.Pfizer is already facing political pushback at home that is only likely to intensify with the U.S. presidential campaign underway, as candidates take aim at high prescription drug prices and companies looking to avoid paying U.S. taxes.A spokesman for Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton said the candidate had not seen details of the proposed merger, but is against tax inversion maneuvers, in which U.S. companies relocate overseas to take advantage of lower tax rates.""Clinton is committed to cracking down on so-called 'inversions,' where a company chooses to leave the U.S. on paper to game the tax system, and believes we should reform our tax code to encourage investment in the U.S., rather than shipping earnings and jobs overseas,"" Clinton spokesman Ian Sams said.Democratic U.S. Senator Charles Schumer of New York said in a statement: ""The continued pursuit of inversions, mergers and foreign acquisitions of major U.S. companies for purely tax purposes shows there is a lot more work to be done to stop them.""From the right, developer and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said the deal was a reminder that the U.S. tax code needed an overhaul.SMOOTHER PATH ""These corporate inversions take capital and, more importantly, jobs offshore,"" he said in a statement. ""We need leadership in Washington to get the tax code changed so companies will be coming to America, not looking for ways to leave."" Billionaire investor Carl Icahn, who has endorsed Trump and launched a $150 million political action committee advocating tax reform to eliminate inversions, said a Pfizer-Allergan deal would result in the loss of the country's 10th largest company to Ireland. Analysts speculated a deal could be all or primarily done with stock because under new U.S. rules aimed at curtailing tax inversions, shareholders of the overseas company must own at least 40 percent of the combined entity.Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan suggested a price of $390 per Allergan share, funded by equity and debt. Allergan's U.S.-traded shares soared as high as $316.80 on Thursday.Earlier Thursday before the companies confirmed the talks, Pfizer Chief Executive Officer Ian Read reiterated his criticism of U.S. corporate taxes.""Our tax rate highly disadvantages American multinational high-tech businesses,"" Read said at a Wall Street Journal event. ""I am fighting with one hand tied behind my back.""Pfizer's effective tax rate is 25 percent, while Allergan's is 15 percent.Given that both sides characterized the talks as ""friendly,"" Pfizer is likely to have a much smoother path outside of the United States after running into intense political opposition in Britain and from AstraZeneca Plc's board in its failed, unsolicited bid last year.""It's definitely a far easier target for Pfizer than AstraZeneca,"" said Christophe Eggmann, investment director at GAM, who holds shares in both companies. ""The hurdle will really be the price."" Moody's Investor Service said the deal would have ""credit positive implications for both companies.""A tax inversion is being discussed in the current talks, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters. In its pursuit of AstraZeneca, Pfizer had hoped to employ such a strategy. Read said Thursday he was open to any moves that produce the best long-term value for the company and shareholders. He said he was looking at various growth strategies, including a deal. Pfizer is expected to decide by late next year whether to sell or spin off its older, off-patent products unit to pare the business and focus on innovative, patent-protected medicines.Allergan, the product of a recent merger with generic drugmaker Actavis, is selling a large portfolio of generic medicines to Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd for $40.5 billion.  CASH FROM BOTOX A purchase of Allergan, with a market value of more than $113 billion, would be the biggest in Pfizer's long history of huge deals, eclipsing the $90 billion Warner-Lambert acquisition through which it gained control of Lipitor, once the world's top-selling medicine.It would also restore the Viagra maker as the world's largest pharmaceutical company, worth about $330 billion, a position it relinquished after Lipitor went off-patent.Allergan expects revenue of more than $8 billion in the second half of 2015, not including generic drugs it is selling to Teva.Pfizer has annual sales of about $48 billion, with about $27 billion from patent-protected drugs, consumer products and vaccines, and about $21 billion from the business it is considering selling.Since the Warner-Lambert purchase, Pfizer has acquired Pharmacia and Wyeth, each deal under a different CEO.The deals have led to many thousands of job cuts. It is not known how many cuts would result from a tie-up with Allergan.Apart from the tax considerations, the deal would give Pfizer access to Allergan's wrinkle treatment Botox, with $2.4 billion in annual sales, and its $1.3 billion Restasis dry eye treatment.By Sept. 10, deal-making in all sectors of healthcare this year had reached a record $447.5 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data.Other large pending tie-ups include pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc's planned purchase of smaller rival Rite Aid Corp announced this week, and pending mergers of health insurers Aetna Inc with Humana Inc, and Anthem Inc with Cigna Corp.

461,"  The proposed corporate tie-up between Pfizer Inc and Allergan Plc, both drug makers, is refocusing attention in Washington on tax-driven corporate inversion transactions.U.S.-based Pfizer moved last week to acquire Ireland's Allergan. Details of their deal were still unavailable, but the companies were said to be eyeing a tax inversion structure.WHAT IS AN INVERSION? In an inversion, a U.S. company typically acquires a smaller, foreign rival and then reincorporates into its home country, on paper at least, to escape U.S. income taxes.In most cases, the U.S. company becomes a subsidiary of the foreign company, although the U.S. company's core operations, such as management and research, remain in the United States. INVERSION RULE BOOK The Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service enforce the rules on inversions.For an inverting U.S. company, the goal is to satisfy the IRS's definition of being a company with a foreign parent, thereby escaping some of the tax burdens of being a company with a U.S. parent, while minimizing the transfer of actual control and management operations overseas.Under IRS rules, an inverted company will not be recognized as having a foreign parent if the shareholders in the old, U.S. company still own 80 percent or more of the new, combined company, and if the combined company has no substantial business activities in the foreign company's home country. In cases where the old U.S. shareholders hold between 60 percent and 80 percent, the inverted company can qualify as foreign-parented under certain restrictions, even if it fails the ""substantial business activities"" test.CRACKDOWN RISKS  Some Democrats have proposed a 50 percent foreign ownership test and other new limits, but legislation was widely seen as unlikely before 2017. Treasury could tighten its rules in the meantime, though it can only go so far on inversions without congressional action.Treasury last cracked down in September 2014, when it blocked inverted companies from using ""hopscotch"" loans to avoid dividend taxes when tapping tax-deferred foreign profits.It also barred inverters from gaining access to offshore profits through ""decontrolling"" strategies that make foreign units no longer U.S.-controlled; and it curbed ""skinny down"" and ""spinversion"" strategies aimed at circumventing inversion rules.Another way inverted companies cut taxes is earnings stripping, or shifting U.S. profits out of the country to a low- or no-tax jurisdiction. Treasury has been expected to issue tighter rules on earnings stripping, but has not yet done so.

Guggenheim is advising Pfizer alongside Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), while JPMorgan is advising Allergan alongside Morgan Stanley (MS.N), the people said on Monday. Other investment banks are also vying to secure roles, the people added.The sources asked not to be identified because the financial advisory roles are not yet public. JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley declined to comment, while Pfizer, Allergan, Guggenheim and Goldman Sachs did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Banks advising Allergan stand to collectively earn between $140 million and $180 million, while banks advising Pfizer could make between $80 million and $100 million in total, depending on the purchase price, according to estimates by consultancy Freeman & Co.   Pfizer, the No. 1 U.S. drugmaker, and Botox maker Allergan disclosed last week they were in friendly talks to merge. Pfizer and Allergan have market capitalizations of $215 billion and $122 billion respectively. The deal, which is several weeks away from an agreement, would potentially set up Pfizer to take advantage of Ireland's lower tax rates, where Allergan is domiciled, according to the sources.

470,"   By Kevin Drawbaugh | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Pfizer Inc's (PFE.N) buyout bid for Allergan Plc (AGN.N) has financial markets on edge over a possible new move by the U.S. Treasury Department against tax-inversion deals, but the outlook for any such steps was still unclear on Friday.    For months, Treasury has offered no fresh guidance on the inversion issue, leaving tax experts to speculate about what could come next. Inversions typically involve a U.S. multinational buying a smaller foreign rival and relocating to its home country, if only on paper, to escape U.S. taxation.    Allergan shares fell 2.3 percent on Thursday afternoon amid reports that Treasury might move to block its deal with Pfizer.    Possible steps the government might take include tightening the rules on two strategies related to inversions, tax experts said: ""earnings stripping"" and ""skinny down"" distributions.    Treasury took several actions in September 2014 to reduce the tax benefits available to companies that have inverted, while also making new inversions more difficult to do and less potentially rewarding. The moves stemmed a wave of inversions, but not before Minnesota medical technology group Medtronic (MDT.N) reincorporated in Ireland.     At the time, Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service said they were weighing further actions. On Friday, a Treasury spokeswoman offered more of the same language.

471,"   By Kevin Drawbaugh | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Nov 13 Pfizer Inc's buyout bid for Allergan Plc has financial markets on edge over a possible new move by the U.S. Treasury Department against tax-inversion deals, but the outlook for any such steps was still unclear on Friday.For months, Treasury has offered no fresh guidance on the inversion issue, leaving tax experts to speculate about what could come next. Inversions typically involve a U.S. multinational buying a smaller foreign rival and relocating to its home country, if only on paper, to escape U.S. taxation.Allergan shares fell 2.3 percent on Thursday afternoon amid reports that Treasury might move to block its deal with Pfizer.Possible steps the government might take include tightening the rules on two strategies related to inversions, tax experts said: ""earnings stripping"" and ""skinny down"" distributions.Treasury took several actions in September 2014 to reduce the tax benefits available to companies that have inverted, while also making new inversions more difficult to do and less potentially rewarding. The moves stemmed a wave of inversions, but not before Minnesota medical technology group Medtronic  reincorporated in Ireland.At the time, Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service said they were weighing further actions. On Friday, a Treasury spokeswoman offered more of the same language. ""The Treasury Department and the IRS expect to issue additional guidance to further limit inversion transactions,"" said the statement from late last year.That guidance said Treasury was looking at ways ""to address strategies that avoid U.S. tax on U.S. operations by shifting or 'stripping' U.S.-source earnings to lower-tax jurisdictions, including through intercompany debt.""Because U.S. corporations don't disclose what they pay in income taxes, it's hard to estimate how much revenue has been lost to inversions or could be lost in the future.

474,"  (Repeats story published late on Monday, with no changes)By Tom Bergin and Kevin DrawbaughRINGASKIDDY, Ireland Nov 16 Drugmaker Pfizer's  plans to take over Allergan have faced a political backlash in the United States over fears a deal would lead to the company shifting its headquarters and taxable profits to Ireland.However a Reuters examination of corporate filings in Europe, patent databases and other information shows the company has for over a decade been shifting profits generated by American scientists and patients overseas - to a subsidiary based in the rolling hills of County Cork.Pfizer and Allergan are in talks to create the world's biggest drug company by market value and analysts expect a deal would likely involve Pfizer ""inverting"", or reversing into the smaller, Irish-registered Allergan.Ireland's tax rate is 12.5 percent, a fraction of the 35 to 40 percent levied in the United States.President Barack Obama has described inversions as unpatriotic and last year changed some tax rules to make inverting less attractive. Allergan investors fear the U.S. treasury department may scupper a deal with additional measures.Yet any such actions would already be too late to stop New York-based Pfizer from reporting in Ireland profits tied to its U.S. activities.Pfizer has used transactions between companies within its group to allow an Irish subsidiary based in Ringaskiddy - Pfizer Ireland Pharmaceuticals - to buy the rights to patents developed in the United States and then use them to make drugs which are sold back to U.S. affiliates.Even though the Irish and other overseas units pay $3.2 billion a year in royalties to use such patent rights, the higher prices at which Pfizer in the United States imports manufactured drugs from affiliates means almost all the profits from these drugs are reported overseas.Drugs which were discovered in the United States, manufactured in Ringaskiddy and sold back to the United States include anti-cholesterol treatment Lipitor - the best-selling prescription drug of all time - and epilepsy drug Lyrica, which generated revenue of over $5 billion last year for Pfizer.Pfizer's actions are entirely lawful and all companies seek to manage their tax bills down.The drugmaker said the prices it used for its inter-subsidiary transactions were fair and that its business structure was motivated primarily by a desire for operational efficiency rather than tax minimisation.""Pfizer fully complies with all applicable accounting and tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate and pays all taxes due,"" spokeswoman Joan Campion said.Jerry Buttimer, a member of the Irish parliament in whose constituency Ringaskiddy lies, said there was nothing wrong or unusual in companies seeking to reduce their tax bills. ""All companies will do what is in the best interest of its operations and shareholders,"" he said.But Ed Kleinbard, Professor of law at the University of Southern California said the company's arrangements reflected ""aggressive tax planning"" and it seemed, from the outside, to be almost as capable in tax planning as pharmacology.""This is a company that is investing heavily in tax research, as well as pharmaceutical research,"" he joked. IRISH PROFITS Pfizer Ireland Pharmaceuticals is at the centre of the drug company's tax-minimising structure.It is registered at a two-storey 1970s era office block on the road into Ringaskiddy, a hamlet with two pubs and several factories operated by major drug manufacturers, a reflection of Irish government policy over the decades to create jobs in the area.Pfizer licenses the rights to drugs developed in the United States and in other countries like Britain, to Pfizer Ireland Pharmaceuticals, according to accounts filed by the Dutch and Belgian parents of Pfizer's Irish units.A manufacturing facility on the 200-acre Ringaskiddy site, which is bordered by green fields on one side and Cork Harbour on the other, produces active ingredients for drugs, based on formulas discovered by overseas affiliates.It currently makes the active ingredients for Lipitor, anti-impotence drug Viagra, anti-lung cancer drug Xalkori and Ibrance, which fights breast cancer.Pfizer also operates other factories across Ireland, and smaller operations in Singapore and Puerto Rico.The compounds pass through a series of Irish companies which, like Pfizer Ireland Pharmaceuticals, have unlimited status meaning they do not have to publish accounts, a requirement of similar-sized limited companies in Ireland. Reuters pieced together the Irish subsidiary's activities over the past 11 years from notes in the accounts of affiliates such as UK-registered Pfizer Ltd, Belgian registered Pfizer Research and Development Company NV and CP Pharmaceuticals International CV, the tax-exempt Dutch partnership through which Pfizer owns its overseas activities, including the Irish operations.It also examined patent and public-health databases and spoke to three company executives.Pfizer does have manufacturing plants in the United States but filings for its overseas units show non-U.S. companies supply over 80 percent of U.S. sales.Those sales generate margins of around 40 percent for Pfizer's overseas arm - earning it over $17 billion in 2013. However, Pfizer has reported losses on its U.S. business in each of the past five years.Pfizer said it follows the ""arm's length"" tax principle when conducting inter-company sales and purchases. This says companies should transact with affiliates at the same prices unconnected companies would.However, academics say it is very hard to judge whether inter-company sales of unique products like patented chemicals, for which there is no independent open market, are conducted at prices that independent companies would agree to use.""The current arm's length rules are always difficult to enforce because of the lack of a comparable price (in the drugs industry),"" said Edmund Outslay, tax accounting professor, Eli Broad College of Business at Michigan State University. U.S. COSTS Many of Pfizer's group costs like research, debt and top management are mostly borne in the United States, despite non U.S. operations accounting for over 60 percent of global sales and 50 percent of hard assets like plants and property.For example, Pfizer has $30-40 billion in long-term debt but only $12 million of it is borne by the overseas arm, filings for CP Pharmaceuticals International show.The company said the practice of borrowing in the United States reflected lender preferences rather than any attempt to shift profits.It added that it was natural for a U.S. company to bear a big share of its overhead costs in the United States.But academics and campaigners are sceptical. ""Pfizer maximises the deductions it takes in the U.S. and maximises the income it shifts to low-tax jurisdictions,"" Outslay said.Pfizer denies its allocation of costs is an intentional ploy to cut taxes.While it manages to report most of the profits generated by U.S. activity overseas, if it wants to take the overseas profits home, to pay dividends or fund buybacks, it has to pay the difference between the tax paid on the money - around 12.5 percent - and the U.S. tax rate.Of $16 billion of U.S. income taxes Pfizer has paid since 2009, almost all reflects payments in relation to such remitting of profits from overseas subsidiaries, a Reuters analysis of group filings shows.Even including this tax on remitted earnings, the amount of cash Pfizer pays in overall income taxes as a share of its profits is lower than rivals like Britain's GlaxoSmithKline , Denmark's Novo Nordisk and Paris-based Sanofi.To avoid having to pay the tax due when cash is repatriated, Pfizer keeps most of its foreign earnings overseas and, indeed, much of it stays in Ireland.In the capital, an office building near the mouth of the Liffey in Ringsend houses Pfizer's Dublin Treasury Centre, which the company says is responsible for treasury operations outside the United States and for helping manage Pfizer's offshore pile of cash on which no U.S. tax has been paid.According to a presentation given by one of its staff last year, this unit overseas a cash mountain approaching $50 billion.But if Pfizer does complete an inversion, the practice of stockpiling foreign profits in Dublin may no longer be necessary. That's because as an Irish-headquartered group it would be free to use its cash for dividends without incurring additional U.S. tax.(Additional reporting by Ransdell Pierson in New York; Editing by Janet McBride and Pravin Char)",2015-11-17,AGN,"Tue Nov 17, 2015 | 2:00am EST",RPT-INSIGHT-How Pfizer has shifted U.S. profits overseas for years,http://www.reuters.com//article/pfizer-tax-idUSL8N13B49U20151117?type=companyNews

Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) is negotiating to buy Allergan, which also makes dry eye treatments, for $370 to $380 per share, a person familiar with the discussions said, compared to its current traded value of around $301.There is some dissatisfaction, however, with that price range, according to a poll by Sanford C. Bernstein research. Its poll of 87 investors showed that 54 percent wanted $390 to $400 a share, but 36 percent were satisfied with the lower reported price range. Wells Fargo senior portfolio manager Margaret Patel, whose  Diversified Capital Builder Fund owned $2.7 million worth of Allergan at the end of September, said on Thursday Pfizer's reported bid is plenty good.""I think it’s a big premium over the current valuation, and at some point you have to say, 'Is there any more new good news to be uncovered?"" Apparently so. Third-quarter fund disclosures reveal that existing Allergan shareholders added a net 10.4 million shares to their holdings. There were newcomers, too.Geode Capital, the hedge fund unit of Boston-based Fidelity Investments, bought 3.1 million Allergan shares, fund disclosures show. Takeovers have been a staple for the pharmaceutical industry, but investors are not necessarily making acquisition premiums a part of their investment thesis.In a note last month to investors, hedge fund Lone Pine Capital said it expects Allergan's profits to grow at double-digit rates even without acquisitions that have historically been part of their value-creation formulas. At the end of September, Lone Pine reported owning 2.6 million shares worth $709 million. Polen Capital sold its remaining stake in Allergan at the end of last year, but only after generating a nearly six-fold return for clients, according to analyst Stephen Atkins.    Funds run by Vanguard Group and T. Rowe Price Group Inc (TROW.O) are among Allergan's largest investors, owning about 6 percent each of the company's outstanding stock, according to Thomson Reuters data. A takeover deal would redomicile U.S. drug giant Pfizer in Ireland just as the U.S. Treasury is preparing to clamp down on so-called inversions that limit a company's tax liability. Inversions typically involve a U.S. multinational buying a smaller foreign competitor and relocating to its home country, if only on paper, to escape U.S. taxation.

481,"  (Adds details on Pfizer's talks with Allergan)By Greg Roumeliotis and Kevin DrawbaughNEW YORK/WASHINGTON Nov 18 Pfizer Inc's  talks to acquire Allergan Plc in a $150 billion deal that would see the U.S. drug giant redomicile in Ireland accelerated on Wednesday, as the U.S. Treasury prepared to clamp down further on such tax inversions.Pfizer is negotiating a price of $370 to $380 for each Allergan share, a person familiar with the discussions said, asking not to be identified because the talks are confidential. Allergan shares ended trading on Wednesday at $310.8 per share.While negotiations have made progress in recent days, an agreement is not imminent and its timing remains uncertain following the Treasury's disclosure that it would seek to tighten the rules on inversions, the source added.Inversions typically involve a U.S. multinational buying a smaller foreign competitor and relocating to its home country, if only on paper, to escape U.S. taxation. Ireland is a common destination. Management usually stays in the United States.""Later this week, we intend to issue additional targeted guidance to deter and reduce further the economic benefits of corporate inversions,"" according to a letter from the Treasury seen by Reuters. Pfizer was not named in the letter, which was signed by Treasury Secretary Jack Lew and addressed to four senior lawmakers: U.S. Senators Ron Wyden and Orrin Hatch, and Representatives Kevin Brady and Sander Levin. All four serve on the Senate and House tax committees.""We have no further comment beyond what is in the letter, at this time,"" a Treasury spokesman said. Pfizer and Allergan also declined to comment.Levin said in a statement: ""The fact that American companies, including Pfizer, continue to pursue inversions makes clear that additional steps are needed to stop this trend."" Noting that Treasury can only do so much on its own, Levin urged Congress to ""get off the sidelines and take action to change the law to stop these tax-motivated inversions.""As a wave of inversions peaked in September 2014, Treasury took several regulatory actions to reduce the tax benefits of inverting, while also making new deals more difficult. That slowed deal flow but did not stop it entirely.For months tax experts have speculated about what could come next from Treasury. Possible steps might include tightening the rules on two strategies related to inversions, tax experts said: so-called ""earnings stripping"" and ""skinny down"" distributions. Earnings-stripping rules combat shifting of U.S. profits out of the country to low-tax jurisdictions. Treasury has struggled to write new rules on this under present law, said tax experts.Rules targeting skinny-down distributions are meant to keep U.S. companies from shrinking their operations ahead of  inversions to evade standards for minimum levels of foreign ownership in inverted companies.A combination of Dublin-based Allergan with New York-based Pfizer would follow an unprecedented wave of consolidation in the pharmaceutical industry as companies seek access to new drugs and increased leverage on pricing.Apart from tax considerations, a deal would give Pfizer access to Allergan's dominance in the aesthetics and ophthalmology markets, and displace Johnson & Johnson as the world's biggest healthcare group.Bloomberg News first reported on the price that Pfizer and Allergan were discussing.

484,"   By Pamela Barbaglia and Greg Roumeliotis  Pfizer Inc and Allergan Inc chief executives have agreed on the roles they would assume in a combined company, removing one of the last hurdles to the largest ever healthcare merger, people familiar with the matter said.Pfizer CEO Ian Read will be CEO of the combined company, while Allergan CEO Brent Saunders will have another very senior role, the people said on Friday, without providing more details. A deal announcement is expected in the coming days, one of the people added.The sources asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential. Pfizer and Allergan declined to comment.A top job at the combined company would position Saunders, 45, to have a claim at the CEO job when Read, 62, steps down. This arrangement also shows that Pfizer's management plans to remain in control, at least in the short term, even if the deal is technically structured so that Allergan buys Pfizer. The roughly $150 billion merger would see New York-based Pfizer redomicile in Ireland, where Botox-maker Allergan is registered.The U.S. Treasury Department on Thursday took steps to clamp down on tax-avoiding inversion deals with new rules, though there was scarce evidence it would stop the biggest inversion of them all, between Pfizer and Allergan.Read, a soft-spoken trained accountant, spent more than 30 years working his way up the Pfizer ranks, taking the reins in 2010 with the sudden departure of CEO Jeffrey Kindler. He viewed refocusing and reigniting the company's research engine as one of his most important tasks after a decade in which Pfizer had produced no important new medicines from its own labs.On Read's watch, Pfizer has seen approval of 10 new medicines, including the breast cancer drug Ibrance, which analysts forecast will eventually generate $5 billion a year, and Trumenba, a potentially important meningitis vaccine, both products of Pfizer labs. In his meteoric career, Saunders has lead Bausch & Lomb, Forest Laboratories and Actavis, which took the Allergan name after acquiring the Botox maker this year, all in the past five years. While his drug discovery credentials are not as strong as Read's, he is highly regarded among his peers as a CEO with top-notch operational expertise.A protégé of industry veteran Fred Hassan, who fixed Pharmacia and sold it to Pfizer, Saunders is credited with helping turn around struggling Schering-Plough and then leading its integration with Merck & Co.

485,"   By Tim McLaughlin  Several large U.S. funds that boosted their stakes in Allergan Plc (AGN.N) in recent months appear to be optimistic about the company's growth prospects, even before Pfizer's reported $150 billion takeover bid for the botox maker.  Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) is negotiating to buy Allergan, which also makes dry eye treatments, for $370 to $380 per share, a person familiar with the discussions said, compared to its current traded value of around $301.There is some dissatisfaction, however, with that price range, according to a poll by Sanford C. Bernstein research. Its poll of 87 investors showed that 54 percent wanted $390 to $400 a share, but 36 percent were satisfied with the lower reported price range. Wells Fargo senior portfolio manager Margaret Patel, whose  Diversified Capital Builder Fund owned $2.7 million worth of Allergan at the end of September, said on Thursday Pfizer's reported bid is plenty good.""I think it’s a big premium over the current valuation, and at some point you have to say, 'Is there any more new good news to be uncovered?"" Apparently so. Third-quarter fund disclosures reveal that existing Allergan shareholders added a net 10.4 million shares to their holdings. There were newcomers, too.Geode Capital, the hedge fund unit of Boston-based Fidelity Investments, bought 3.1 million Allergan shares, fund disclosures show. Takeovers have been a staple for the pharmaceutical industry, but investors are not necessarily making acquisition premiums a part of their investment thesis.In a note last month to investors, hedge fund Lone Pine Capital said it expects Allergan's profits to grow at double-digit rates even without acquisitions that have historically been part of their value-creation formulas. At the end of September, Lone Pine reported owning 2.6 million shares worth $709 million. Polen Capital sold its remaining stake in Allergan at the end of last year, but only after generating a nearly six-fold return for clients, according to analyst Stephen Atkins.    Funds run by Vanguard Group and T. Rowe Price Group Inc (TROW.O) are among Allergan's largest investors, owning about 6 percent each of the company's outstanding stock, according to Thomson Reuters data. A takeover deal would redomicile U.S. drug giant Pfizer in Ireland just as the U.S. Treasury is preparing to clamp down on so-called inversions that limit a company's tax liability. Inversions typically involve a U.S. multinational buying a smaller foreign competitor and relocating to its home country, if only on paper, to escape U.S. taxation.  Inversions figure to be a hot topic in 2016 in a national election year that will determine the next U.S. president.""We shall see whether the administration and Congress are able to block deals that are largely done based on tax inversions,"" said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors' U.S. Intermediary Business in Boston.Mario Gabelli, whose Gamco Investors owned $23 million worth of Pfizer stock at the end of September, said he would commend Pfizer for making a move to get Allergan and lower its tax rate.""The U.S. corporate tax structure is uncompetitive,"" Gabelli said.

486,"  (Adds details from Treasury, analyst comment on Pfizer, background)By Kevin Drawbaugh and Ransdell PiersonWASHINGTON/NEW YORK Nov 19 The U.S. Treasury Department on Thursday took steps to clamp down on tax-avoiding ""inversion"" deals with new rules, though there was scarce evidence they would stop the biggest inversion of them all, between Pfizer Inc and Allergan Plc.The $150 billion proposed deal, still under negotiation, would see New York-based Pfizer redomicile in Ireland, where Botox-maker Allergan is registered.Treasury, which said its new measures are effective immediately, has been wrestling with inversion deals for years because they erode the U.S. corporate tax base by shifting profits overseas.A wave of inversions peaked in September 2014, when Treasury last cracked down, reducing deal flow but not stopping it.U.S. companies are still taking advantage of the law ""to move their tax residence overseas to avoid paying taxes in the U.S., without making significant changes in the nature of their overall operations,"" Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said.""While we intend to take additional action in the coming months, there is only so much the Treasury Department can do to prevent these tax-avoidance transactions. Only legislation can decisively stop inversions,"" Lew said in a statement.In an inversion, a U.S. company typically buys a smaller foreign rival and relocates, at least on paper, to the rival's home country so the new combined company is not U.S.-based, though core management usually stays in the United States Because of the expected structure of the Pfizer and Allergan deal, many analysts believe the new Treasury inversion rules may present little risk. Allergan shareholders would own more than 40 percent of the combined company following a merger with Pfizer, people familiar with the terms being negotiated have said.""If ... Allergan is more than 40 percent of the new company, most (if not all) of the content of today's Treasury press release doesn't even apply,"" Evercore ISI senior analyst Umer Raffat said in an emailed note.BREAKUP FEE SIGNALS CONFIDENCE  The exact structure of the merger between Pfizer and Allergan is not known, making the full impact of the new Treasury rules on inversions difficult to assess.Nevertheless, the deal could be structured so that Allergan is technically the acquiring entity, though Allergan shareholders would still get a premium in a primarily stock-based transaction, according to the source familiar with the terms.In a sign that the two companies are not discouraged by the regulatory hurdles, Pfizer is negotiating a 2-3 percent break-up fee with Allergan, which would be in line with most deals that do not face such risks, people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday.Over the years, Pfizer's profits held outside the United States have grown to $74 billion. The 35 percent U.S. corporate income tax rate is not due on those earnings unless and until Pfizer brings them into the United States, under U.S. law. Some tax experts have said these overseas profits are a crucial part of the Allergan deal because if Pfizer were no longer a U.S. company it would have readier and less costly access to them.OFFSHORE EARNINGS Under Treasury's new rules, it is making inversions harder to do by limiting a U.S. acquirer's ability to set up a new foreign parent in a third country and to ""stuff"" assets into a foreign parent to meet existing limits on post-inversion ownership levels.Treasury will also now require that an inverted company be tax-resident in its new home country under that country's rules, not just U.S. law, to pass a test of whether it has 25 percent of its business activity in the new country. Passing that means it can be recognized as a foreign company.Treasury is also imposing a rule, retroactive to September 2014, limiting an inverted company's ability to transfer foreign operations to the new foreign parent after an inversion transaction without paying current U.S. tax.No action was taken to curb inversion-related ""earnings stripping,"" in which U.S. companies shift U.S. profits offshore to avoid U.S. taxes, but Lew said Treasury would continue to examine that issue and others.""Corporate tax inversions are costing the U.S. tens of billions of dollars in lost tax revenue,"" Democratic Representative Sander Levin said in a statement. ""The rumors that Pfizer may announce its plans to invert as soon as next week ... highlight the urgent need for Congress to act.""

487,"   By Greg Roumeliotis and Ransdell Pierson  Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) was due to secure formal board approval on Sunday for its acquisition of Botox maker Allergan Plc (AGN.N) for more than $150 billion, creating the world's biggest drug maker, according to people familiar with the matter. The deal, the largest ever in the healthcare sector, is sure to draw political ire in a U.S. presidential election year because Pfizer would redomicile to Ireland, where Allergan is registered, in a so-called ""inversion"" that would slash its corporate tax rate.It will also reignite debate in the pharmaceutical industry over the role of research and development, with Allergan Chief Executive Brent Saunders, a prolific dealmaker and a skeptic of in-house drug discovery, joining the combined company in a position to influence its strategy.   The deal would involve Pfizer paying with 11.3 of its shares for each Allergan share, the people said. There will also be a small cash component, accounting for less than 10 percent of the value of the deal, the people said.Pfizer's Chief Executive Ian Read, 62, will be CEO of the combined company, with Allergan's CEO Brent Saunders, 45, serving in a very senior role focused on operations and the integration, the people added. Saunders will also have a seat on the combined company's board, one of the people said.The sources asked not to be identified because the terms of the deal are not yet public. Pfizer and Allergan declined to comment.COLOSSUS The deal would create a pharmaceutical colossus with annual sales of more than $60 billion, putting the merged group well ahead of No. 2 U.S. drugmaker Merck & Co (MRK.N), which has annual sales of about $40 billion. Widely used Pfizer drugs such as Lipitor, Viagra and nerve pain treatment Lyrica would be brought together with Allergan's Namenda memory loss treatment, Restasis dry eye medication and other leading eye-care brands.It would be the biggest merger of the year, topping beer maker Anheuser-Busch InBev's (ABI.BR) proposed $107 billion takeover of SABMiller Plc SAB.L. And it would realize Read's longtime ambition of an inversion deal that would get Pfizer out from under the 35 percent U.S. corporate tax rate, among the world's highest. The tax rate in Ireland is 12.5 percent. Pfizer’s talks with Allergan come more than a year after the U.S. firm abandoned a bid to acquire AstraZeneca (AZN.L) and move its tax headquarters to Britain. The U.S. Treasury last year, and again last week, updated its rules on inversions to make it harder for companies to avoid U.S taxes by moving overseas. But experts have said these moves would do little to prevent Pfizer from inverting. Although Pfizer has decried the high U.S. corporate tax rate, it has minimized its U.S. taxes for years by selling its drug patents to overseas subsidiaries and then using them to make drugs that are sold back to U.S. affiliates. While generating big profit margins for its overseas arm, the practice has allowed Pfizer to report losses on its higher-taxed U.S. business in each of the past five years.     Many industry analysts and investors believe Pfizer could be bulking up with Allergan's fast-growing brands as a prelude to splitting by 2017 into two companies - one selling high-margin branded drugs and one selling inexpensive generics that have  dragged down Pfizer results over the past few years.      Read, a trained accountant, has said Pfizer could decide on such a split by late 2016, after it completes separate financial analyses of the two businesses. Pfizer's $15 billion purchase earlier this year of hospital products maker Hospira, which sells generic injectable drugs and is developing biosimilar versions of top-selling biotech medicines, was widely seen as a move to make its generics business more attractive ahead of a sale.Allergan has agreed to sell its own wide array of generics by early next year to Israeli drugmaker Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (TEVA.TA) for $40.5 billion.Speculation has been rife on Wall Street whether Read or Saunders would take the helm of the combined company, and whether Saunders would be content to play second fiddle to Read, who became Pfizer CEO in 2010 after more than 30 years with the company. Saunders has had a meteoric rise in the industry over the past five years, turning around eye-care company Bausch & Lomb and also leading Forest Laboratories and Swiss drugmaker Actavis, which took the Allergan name after acquiring it this year.  Earlier, he won plaudits for helping Schering-Plough overcome serious quality-control problems and then leading its integration with Merck & Co.Due to his rapid ascent and moves, Saunders has not presided over start-to-finish development of a drug, a process that can take 12 years or longer.And unlike large drugmakers who conduct costly discovery research, Saunders has said that it makes more sense economically to acquire medicines that have already shown promise in human trials.But in a recent interview, Saunders said he would be willing to put a higher emphasis on drug discovery if it makes sense for his company. Pfizer shares closed little changed on Friday at $32.18, while Allergan's rose 3.4 percent to $312.46, both on the New York Stock Exchange.

490,"   By Ransdell Pierson and Bill Berkrot | NEW YOR  NEW YOR Pfizer Inc on Monday said it would buy Botox maker Allergan Plc in a deal worth $160 billion to slash its U.S. tax bill, rekindling a fierce political debate over the financial maneuver.The acquisition, which would create the world's largest drugmaker and shift Pfizer's headquarters to Ireland, would also be the biggest-ever instance of a U.S. company re-incorporating overseas to lower its taxes. U.S. President Barack Obama has called such inversion deals unpatriotic and has tried to crack down on the practice.Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton pledged to propose measures to prevent such deals. The merger was also slammed by her rival Senator Bernie Sanders as well as by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.""The fact that Pfizer is leaving our country with a tremendous loss of jobs is disgusting,"" Trump said in a statement.It was not immediately known how many jobs would be lost as a result of the merger.Shares of Allergan fell 3.4 percent and Pfizer closed down 2.6 percent as investors learned the merger, under discussion since late October, would bring lower cost savings than they had hoped.Pfizer also disappointed some investors by delaying by two years a decision on whether to sell off its division consisting of products facing generic competition.To avoid potential restrictions, the transaction was structured as smaller, Dublin-based Allergan buying Pfizer, although the combined company will be known as Pfizer Plc and continue to be led by Chief Executive Officer Ian Read.The U.S. Treasury, concerned about losing billions in tax revenue, has been taking steps to limit the benefits of tax inversion deals, but it admitted last week that it would take legislation from Congress to stop such moves.The deal enhances offerings from both Pfizer's faster-growing branded products business, with additions like Botox, and its older established products unit. Still, investors had hoped Pfizer would sell off the lower-margin business in 2017, a move now put off by the time required to integrate Allergan. ""The only thing I'd really say I'm disappointed about is Pfizer's postponing their break up,"" said Gabelli Funds portfolio manager Jeff Jonas. He called the delay decision ""pretty conservative and a little late.""Others were disappointed by other aspects of the deal, including the projected cost savings, and a lack of details on potentially increased share buybacks.""Synergies of $2 billion plus in the third year are less than the $4 billion we had estimated in year 1,"" said Cowen and Co analyst Steve Scala.On a conference call with analysts, Pfizer said the merger would give it enhanced access to its tens of billions of dollars parked overseas and allow for more share buybacks, dividend payments and business development. The combined company would have annual sales of about $64 billion.The deal is expected to close in the second half of 2016. TAX SAVINGS Allergan CEO Brent Saunders will become president and chief operating officer of the combined company, with oversight of all commercial businesses.Read, who has long sought to slash Pfizer's U.S. tax rate,  said the deal would help put the company on ""on a more competitive footing"" with overseas-based rivals.The company had estimated it would pay about 25 percent in corporate taxes this year, compared with about 15 percent for Allergan. Pfizer Chief Financial Officer Frank D'Amelio said he expected a combined tax rate of 17 percent to 18 percent by 2017. The deal comes some 18 months after the failure of Read's initial attempt at an inversion, a $118 billion bid to acquire Britain-based AstraZeneca Plc that ran into stiff opposition from that company's management and UK politicians.Saunders said the combination would provide access to about 70 additional worldwide markets for Allergan products, such as Botox wrinkle treatment, Alzheimer's drug Namenda and dry-eye medication Restasis.For 166-year-old Pfizer, Allergan would be the fourth huge acquisition over the last 15 years - one for each of the last 4 CEOs - following purchases of Warner-Lambert, Pharmacia and Wyeth.This also caps a record year for healthcare mergers and acquisitions, taking their cumulative value in 2015 to more than $600 billion..They include prior big deals involving Saunders, such as the $70.5 billion acquisition of Allergan by Actavis, which then took the Allergan name, and an agreement to sell that company's huge portfolio of generic drugs to Teva Pharmaceutical Industries for $40.5 billion.Allergan and Pfizer estimated their merger would increase earnings per share by 10 percent, excluding special items, in 2019 and add by a high-teens percentage rate in 2020.The deal values Allergan shares at $363.63 each, about 16 percent more than their closing price of $312.46 on Friday. Pfizer shareholders would control of 56 percent of the combined company.

494,"   By Svea Herbst-Bayliss | BOSTON  BOSTON Hedge fund managers' favorite stocks stumbled hard this year to post their worst returns since the financial crisis with health-care companies, such as Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX.TO), leading the way lower, according to new data from Goldman Sachs.Goldman analysts calculated that the basket of managers' 50 most heavily owned stocks - among which are Allergan (AGN.N), Facebook (FB.O), Netflix (NFLX.O) and Cheniere Energy (LNG.A) - lost 2.4 percent since January, while the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index gained 3 percent during the same time.Since August, when Goldman rebalanced what it calls its Hedge Fund VIP list, the industry's favorite stocks have lost 5 percent, compared with the S&P 500's 1 percent gain, Goldman said in a report released on Monday.""Health-care stocks within the basket, most notably VRX, were responsible for nearly 70 percent of the basket's negative return,"" the report said, referring to Valeant. Valeant's stock price tumbled some 70 percent in the 3-1/2 months from July through mid-October amid questions about its drug pricing strategy and accounting practices. The heavy losses have weighed on hedge funds including William Ackman's Pershing Square and Nehal Chopra's Tiger Ratan, investors have said.Hedge funds' stock picks and what managers earn off their bets have been scrutinized for years, but they are receiving extra attention now that pension funds and other institutional investors are putting more money into hedge funds. Energy company Cheniere, which is among the top-10 holdings of 14 hedge funds and is 64 percent-owned by hedge funds, also dragged on returns, having dropped 29 percent this year.Traditionally, the Hedge Fund VIP list has outperformed the S&P 500, the Goldman data show, noting that the list beat the S&P 500 by 2.65 percentage points last year. In 2013 it beat the S&P 500 by 9 percentage points after beating it by 7 percentage points in 2012. When stocks tumbled in August amid concerns of slower growth in China and nervousness about when the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates, many fund managers adjusted their holdings, cutting health-care exposure and adding to technology holdings.""Hedge funds moved away from laggards to stronger performers,"" Goldman analysts wrote, noting that the VIP list now includes Chinese web services company Baidu Inc (BIDU.O) and online payments system company PayPal Holdings (PYPL.O) and no longer includes food company Kraft Heinz Co (KHC.O) and Valeant.

500,"   By Ransdell Pierson and Bill Berkrot | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Pfizer Inc on Monday said it would buy Botox maker Allergan Plc in a deal worth $160 billion to slash its U.S. tax bill, rekindling a fierce political debate over the financial maneuver.The acquisition, which would create the world's largest drugmaker and shift Pfizer's headquarters to Ireland, would also be the biggest-ever instance of a U.S. company re-incorporating overseas to lower its taxes. U.S. President Barack Obama has called such inversion deals unpatriotic and has tried to crack down on the practice. Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton pledged to propose measures to prevent such deals. The merger was also slammed by her rival Senator Bernie Sanders as well as by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.""The fact that Pfizer is leaving our country with a tremendous loss of jobs is disgusting,"" Trump said in a statement. It was not immediately known how many jobs would be lost as a result of the merger. Shares of Allergan fell 3.4 percent and Pfizer closed down 2.6 percent as investors learned the merger, under discussion since late October, would bring lower cost savings than they had hoped.Pfizer also disappointed some investors by delaying by two years a decision on whether to sell off its division consisting of products facing generic competition.To avoid potential restrictions, the transaction was structured as smaller, Dublin-based Allergan buying Pfizer, although the combined company will be known as Pfizer Plc and continue to be led by Chief Executive Officer Ian Read.The U.S. Treasury, concerned about losing billions in tax revenue, has been taking steps to limit the benefits of tax inversion deals, but it admitted last week that it would take legislation from Congress to stop such moves.The deal enhances offerings from both Pfizer's faster-growing branded products business, with additions like Botox, and its older established products unit. Still, investors had hoped Pfizer would sell off the lower-margin business in 2017, a move now put off by the time required to integrate Allergan.  ""The only thing I'd really say I'm disappointed about is Pfizer's postponing their break up,"" said Gabelli Funds portfolio manager Jeff Jonas. He called the delay decision ""pretty conservative and a little late."" Others were disappointed by other aspects of the deal, including the projected cost savings, and a lack of details on potentially increased share buybacks.""Synergies of $2 billion plus in the third year are less than the $4 billion we had estimated in year 1,"" said Cowen and Co analyst Steve Scala.On a conference call with analysts, Pfizer said the merger would give it enhanced access to its tens of billions of dollars parked overseas and allow for more share buybacks, dividend payments and business development. The combined company would have annual sales of about $64 billion.The deal is expected to close in the second half of 2016. TAX SAVINGS Allergan CEO Brent Saunders will become president and chief operating officer of the combined company, with oversight of all commercial businesses. Read, who has long sought to slash Pfizer's U.S. tax rate,  said the deal would help put the company on ""on a more competitive footing"" with overseas-based rivals. The company had estimated it would pay about 25 percent in corporate taxes this year, compared with about 15 percent for Allergan. Pfizer Chief Financial Officer Frank D'Amelio said he expected a combined tax rate of 17 percent to 18 percent by 2017.The deal comes some 18 months after the failure of Read's initial attempt at an inversion, a $118 billion bid to acquire Britain-based AstraZeneca Plc that ran into stiff opposition from that company's management and UK politicians. Saunders said the combination would provide access to about 70 additional worldwide markets for Allergan products, such as Botox wrinkle treatment, Alzheimer's drug Namenda and dry-eye medication Restasis.For 166-year-old Pfizer, Allergan would be the fourth huge acquisition over the last 15 years - one for each of the last 4 CEOs - following purchases of Warner-Lambert, Pharmacia and Wyeth.This also caps a record year for healthcare mergers and acquisitions, taking their cumulative value in 2015 to more than $600 billion.. They include prior big deals involving Saunders, such as the $70.5 billion acquisition of Allergan by Actavis, which then took the Allergan name, and an agreement to sell that company's huge portfolio of generic drugs to Teva Pharmaceutical Industries for $40.5 billion.Allergan and Pfizer estimated their merger would increase earnings per share by 10 percent, excluding special items, in 2019 and add by a high-teens percentage rate in 2020.  The deal values Allergan shares at $363.63 each, about 16 percent more than their closing price of $312.46 on Friday. Pfizer shareholders would control of 56 percent of the combined company. The record-breaking deal includes $8 billion in debt, Pfizer said.Pfizer was advised by Guggenheim Securities, Goldman Sachs & Co, Centerview Partners and Moelis & Co. Its legal advisers are Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz; Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP and A & L Goodbody. Allergan was advised by J.P.

508,"  (Adds details on investment, background on fund)By Svea Herbst-BaylissBOSTON Dec 31 Billionaire investor William Ackman said on Thursday he sold about 5 million shares in drug company Valeant International in order to generate a tax loss as investors in his Pershing Square Capital Management face the biggest loss in the company's history.Ackman's hedge fund now owns 29.1 million shares in Valeant, or 8.5 percent of the company, down from 34.1 million shares, or 9.9 percent, according to a regulatory filing made after the market closed on Thursday, the last trading day of 2015.Pershing Square sold shares in its two on-shore portfolios in order to generate a tax loss for investors while the two off-shore portfolios did not sell any shares, the filing said.News that Ackman, one of Valeant's biggest and most vocal backers, sold some of his shares comes at the tail end of a tumultuous year for the Canadian pharmaceutical company, whose share price had surged and then plummeted amid questions about its drug pricing and accounting practices. The company, after disclosing last week that its chief executive officer, Michael Pearson, had been hospitalized with severe pneumonia, this week named a trio of company executives to take over until Pearson returns.Ackman was not available to comment, and a company spokesman declined to say anything beyond the filing. For Ackman, 2015 is sure to be one of his worst years ever, in part because of the heavy losses in Valeant. One of Ackman's funds posted a 19.7 percent loss through Dec. 29. Final calculations for all of the firm's funds have not been made.The results mark a dramatic about face from last year's 40 percent gain, which ranked Ackman among the hedge fund industry's best performers. The 2014 gain was fueled mainly by an increase in drug company Allergan's shares as Ackman pressured it to sell itself to Valeant.Allergan sold itself to Actavis instead and in March of 2015, Ackman said he had made a sizable bet in Valeant. But by late August, Valeant had gone from being one of Ackman's biggest winners to being his largest loser, costing him and his investors, including state pension funds, billions in losses.While Ackman criticized Valeant for having a public relations problem, the activist investor stuck by the company, upping his stake significantly.Valeant's shares closed the year down 22 percent, at $101.67, at less than half the year's high of $260 reached in early August.(Reporting by Svea Herbst-Bayliss; Editing by Leslie Adler and Dan Grebler)",2015-12-31,AGN,"Thu Dec 31, 2015 | 5:27pm EST",UPDATE 1-Ackman's fund sells 5 mln Valeant shares to generate tax loss,http://www.reuters.com//article/hedgefunds-ackman-valeant-pharms-idUSL1N14K1EH20151231?type=companyNews
509,"   By Ransdell Pierson | NEW YORK  NEW YORK The research chiefs of betrothed drugmakers Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) and Allergan (AGN.N) say the proposed combination of their experimental drugs deserves more credit, including potential blockbuster treatments for schizophrenia and depression.Pfizer agreed in November to buy Botox-maker Allergan for $160 billion in a transaction meant to slash Pfizer's tax rate and achieve other cost savings. The tax-inversion deal would shift Pfizer's headquarters to Dublin and is slated to close in the second half of 2016.Industry regulators and U.S. lawmakers have criticized the deal for its reliance on financial engineering. But more recently, company executives have said medical benefits of bringing together their drugs in development have been ""underappreciated"" and some healthcare analysts are making the case that combining the two research programs will yield sales and earnings ahead of Wall Street expectations.""There has been a lot of attention on financial aspects of the deal, but there has been an underestimation of the Allergan pipeline,"" Pfizer research chief Mikael Dolsten told Reuters in a recent interview.Dolsten told Reuters that Allergan's depression treatment rapastinel, which has shown promise of treating symptoms within hours rather than weeks required for standard treatments, could be ""transformational"" if it succeeds in late-stage trials.Further studies of Vraylar, a treatment for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder approved in September, could show it has ""unique"" ability to treat negative symptoms of schizophrenia, such as social withdrawal and slowed movement, Dolsten said. Relamorelin, potentially the first new treatment in decades for delayed emptying of food from the stomach, is another big opportunity, he said. Allergan has predicted peak annual sales of up to $2 billion for rapastinel and up to $1 billion each for Vraylar, relamorelin, an experimental treatment for uterine fibroids called Esmya and Allergan's recently approved Viberzi treatment for irritable bowel syndrome. It expects potential annual sales of up to $2 billion each for experimental treatments for migraine headaches and for a leading cause of blindness called macular degeneration. The forecasts have largely fallen on deaf ears, said Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan. ""Right now there are almost no expectations for Allergan's pipeline,"" Divan said. ""Even if they get just a few billion dollars out of these products, that would be more than people give them credit for."" Pfizer expects a modest lift to its earnings in 2018 from the planned purchase of Allergan, a boost of 10 percent in 2019 and a high-teens percentage boost in 2020. Divan said he expects Allergan's pipeline to add a few extra percentage points of sales and earnings growth in all three of those time periods.""We have 70 products in mid- to late-stage trials, but I think our pipeline is under-recognized,"" David Nicholson, research head for Allergan's branded products, said in an interview. He attributed the lack of visibility to the rapid series of acquisitions and deals that created the present-day Allergan, folding in the portfolios of large drugmakers such as Forest Laboratories and Actavis. ""It takes time for people to realize these are all part of one company's pipeline,"" said Nicholson. Nomura analyst Shibani Malhotra said less than 20 percent of Allergan sales are from outside the United States, and that Botox and other Allergan products could eventually get a surprisingly strong boost from 70 new international markets that Pfizer will open up, including Japan.""The biggest advantage for Allergan would be in leveraging Pfizer's global sales forces,"" Malhotra said.Pfizer Chief Executive Ian Read is slated to lead the combined company, with Allergan's younger Chief Executive Brent Saunders serving as president and chief operating officer.Nicholson, in a presentation on Tuesday with Read, Saunders and Dolsten at the annual JP Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco, said Allergan's pipeline deserves far more credit, as does Pfizer's array of immuno-oncology drugs.""When we put these pipelines together, (other) companies better watch out!""

Relamorelin, potentially the first new treatment in decades for delayed emptying of food from the stomach, is another big opportunity, he said.Allergan has predicted peak annual sales of up to $2 billion for rapastinel and up to $1 billion each for Vraylar, relamorelin, an experimental treatment for uterine fibroids called Esmya and Allergan's recently approved Viberzi treatment for irritable bowel syndrome.It expects potential annual sales of up to $2 billion each for experimental treatments for migraine headaches and for a leading cause of blindness called macular degeneration.The forecasts have largely fallen on deaf ears, said Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan. ""Right now there are almost no expectations for Allergan's pipeline,"" Divan said. ""Even if they get just a few billion dollars out of these products, that would be more than people give them credit for.""Pfizer expects a modest lift to its earnings in 2018 from the planned purchase of Allergan, a boost of 10 percent in 2019 and a high-teens percentage boost in 2020. Divan said he expects Allergan's pipeline to add a few extra percentage points of sales and earnings growth in all three of those time periods.""We have 70 products in mid- to late-stage trials, but I think our pipeline is under-recognized,"" David Nicholson, research head for Allergan's branded products, said in an interview. He attributed the lack of visibility to the rapid series of acquisitions and deals that created the present-day Allergan, folding in the portfolios of large drugmakers such as Forest Laboratories and Actavis. ""It takes time for people to realize these are all part of one company's pipeline,"" said Nicholson.Nomura analyst Shibani Malhotra said less than 20 percent of Allergan sales are from outside the United States, and that Botox and other Allergan products could eventually get a surprisingly strong boost from 70 new international markets that Pfizer will open up, including Japan.""The biggest advantage for Allergan would be in leveraging Pfizer's global sales forces,"" Malhotra said.Pfizer Chief Executive Ian Read is slated to lead the combined company, with Allergan's younger Chief Executive Brent Saunders serving as president and chief operating officer.Nicholson, in a presentation on Tuesday with Read, Saunders and Dolsten at the annual JP Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco, said Allergan's pipeline deserves far more credit, as does Pfizer's array of immuno-oncology drugs.""When we put these pipelines together, (other) companies better watch out!""

511,"   By Hillary Flynn and Davide Scigliuzzo  NEW YORK, Jan 12 (IFR) - Investors could easily soak up a US$60bn bond from AB InBev if the beer giant wants to sell that much debt this week to help fund its acquisition of rival brewer SABMiller.AB InBev could raise US$30bn-$60bn in funding - perhaps setting a new mark for the largest bond ever - and the deal is expected to be a blowout success.The buyside is primed and ready for a large and liquid high-grade bond issue to kick off a primary market that has been uneven so far in 2016, largely due to broader volatility.""It will help establish a clearing level for large deals, and also help pave the way for more M&A deals to come,"" one syndicate banker told IFR.""This is a defensive credit, and there will be a gravitational pull towards a deal like that.""In addition to the liquidity inherent in such a massive bond - the current record is Verizon's US$49bn trade from 2013 - many believe the company will meet its post-acquisition targets.One portfolio manager on a call with the company Monday said he was comfortable that AB InBev would limit dividend increases and stock buybacks for some time after the acquisition.""They have been able to execute large mergers in the past,"" he said. ""Management lived up to bond investors' expectations and executed well. They want to replicate that.""He said the company did not discuss details of the bond but expected multi-billion tranches with maturities of two, three, five, 10 and 30 years, as well as a possible floating-rate note. PAY TO PLAY Amid worries out of China, flagging commodities prices and other woes, the market has seen heavy volatility of late - which could make AB InBev have to pay more in new issue concessions.Yet it is unlikely to have to offer the whopping premiums Verizon did on its record deal in September 2013.Verizon offered a 50bp NIC on top of the 50bp widening in its curve after announcing its US$130bn acquisition of Vodafone's stake in Verizon Wireless in one hit.Since those days, however, the dollar bond market has repeatedly shown its ability to absorb trillions of dollars in debt issuance. ""Verizon was very much a trek into the unknown,"" said one banker. ""I don't think (AB InBev) will have to pay as much.""The banker expected the final concession to be in the range of 15bp-30bp, depending on the size of the offering and broader market conditions on the day. The deal is expected as soon as  Wednesday.A 30bp premium would be high in the investment-grade market for such a well-heeled corporate, but not exceptional given the potential size of the offering, bankers said.A likely worst-case scenario would see AB InBev paying slightly more than Actavis did last year on its US$21bn 10-tranche deal to finance its Allergan acquisition - the second-largest bond sale after Verizon's.That deal paid a measly 4bp to 6bp in concession versus outstanding bonds on the day. ""The risk for the market is if (AB InBev) doesn't price right,"" said the banker. ""Investors are writing big checks here, and if the bonds don't trade well, that is going to be an issue.""MATURITY MATTERS Given the recent spate of volatility, driven in part by the to and fro surrounding the Federal Reserve rates hike last month, investor demand of late has skewed to shorter maturities.Of the close to US$30bn of bond issuance done in the last month, some US$15bn has been in tenors up to five years and almost all of the balance in 10 years, according to IFR data.Still, AB InBev should easily be able to do some longer tenors if it decides it wants to.""I expect the company will see demand across the maturity curve, including long maturities,"" said Jonathan Duensing, deputy CIO and senior portfolio manager at Amundi Smith Breeden.The brewing giant started meeting with investors about the deal near the end of last year, and has been roadshowing the bonds to both US and European investors Monday and Tuesday.""It is a perfect name and sector for a volatile market,"" said a banker away from the deal. ""Look at the financial crisis: people were drinking more beer than ever before.""

Lilly said the latest court ruling was that its vitamin regimen patent would not be infringed by Actavis marketing pemetrexed trometamol with instructions to dilute the product only with dextrose solution. In June, the appeals court said Lilly's patent would be indirectly infringed by the sale of certain alternative salt forms of pemetrexed with instructions to dilute them with saline solution, but it left open the question of dextrose solution. The UK court rulings also apply to France, Italy and Spain under a legal system of corresponding declarations, and Lilly said it planned to appeal the latest decision.In major European countries, the basic compound patents for Alimta expired in December 2015 but its vitamin regimen patents run until June 2021.

Talking about the speculation around the takeover, CEO Brenton Saunders said he saw no obstacles with the closing of the deal.""(The deal) was constructed in a highly legal way with advice of many experts and I think we're in a very strong position to close this deal in the second half of the year.""Allergan forecast 2016 adjusted revenue of about $17 billion, just shy of the analysts' average estimate of $17.66 billion. This estimate takes into account foreign exchange impact of $200 million and a $500 million decline in the company's low-margin generics business. RBC Capital Markets analysts said the 2016 forecast was largely in line with the Street's expectations. ""But importantly, it implies 10 percent plus growth in the core branded revenue which is solid,"" they wrote.Allergan's net loss narrowed to $700.5 million, or $1.78 per share, in the fourth quarter, from $732.9 million, or $3.34 per share, a year earlier. GAAP results were impacted by acquisition-related expenses, the company said.Excluding special items, Allergan earned $3.41 per share, while analysts were expecting a profit of $3.34 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Revenue rose about 74 percent to $4.20 billion in the quarter, beating analysts' average estimate of $4.19 billion.

530,"   By Trevor Hunnicutt | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Calls in the U.S. presidential campaign to cut pharmaceutical prices are not helping to revive a barely two-month-old exchange-traded fund that invests in shares of generic drugmakers.In fact, low prices that define generic drugs may be the ETF's biggest stumbling block, analysts said this week.The Market Vectors Generic Drugs ETF, which fund manager Van Eck Associates Corp launched with $2.5 million in assets on Jan. 12, has fallen 5 percent through Wednesday and has failed to attract even $1 in new money, according to Lipper.The iShares Global Healthcare ETF, with three-quarters of its portfolio in pharmaceutical and biotech stocks, fell only 0.9 percent.The Market Vectors fund, which tracks the Indxx LLC-built generic index, is the only U.S. ETF built on shares of generic drugmakers, which have been languishing.Attacks on soaring drug prices by Democratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton and other politicians have failed to boost profits on cheaper alternatives to patented branded drugs. Distributors like Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc are squeezing prices of generics. ""Generic drugs are essentially commodity products chosen on cost and as the purchasers consolidate and exert their leverage we would expect downward pressure,"" said Michael Levesque, analyst for Moody's Corp.""There is a lot of discussion around drug-pricing reform and different initiatives such as letting Medicare negotiate drug pricing, but none of those become a reality unless Congress implements them through the passage of a law, and that has not happened despite the statements in campaigns.""Mylan NV, the Market Vectors ETF's fifth-largest holding, is off 16 percent this year after posting weak results and as investors panned the company's deal to acquire Swedish rival Meda AB. Another top holding, Endo International PLC, is off 29 percent this year in part after February earnings were dented by pricing pressure on its generic drugs. Two of the Market Vectors fund's top three holdings, Allergan Plc and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd, have lost value this year, while the third, Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd, has risen 6 percent.Enthusiasm has faded for biosimilars, drugs designed to have properties similar to those licensed previously, during the long wait for U.S. regulatory approval.Only one biosimilar, by Novartis AG, has come on the U.S. market. The treatment for chemotherapy side effects, designed to rival Amgen Inc's Neupogen, has been less successful than investors such as Andy Acker, manager of the Janus Global Life Sciences Fund, had expected. Amgen is Acker's top holding. Celltrion Inc, a top-10 holding of the Market Vectors generic ETF, backs a biosimilar drug expected to win approval. The stock has rallied 30 percent this year, but that has not been enough to make up for losses in the ETF's other stocks.Indxx LLC, whose index the Market Vectors generic ETF tracks, said 15 percent of the fund's returns come from companies that stand to profit from biosimilars, and that just half of its return comes from U.S. companies.""You tend to see a lot of companies get caught up in"" market selloffs, said James Duffy, ETF product manager for Van Eck. ""This is an area that we feel may have the potential to drive a lot of growth in the near future.""

531,"  * Deal cements Teva as world's largest generic drugmaker* Concessions include products on the market, in the pipeline   (Adds analyst comments, closing share price; paragraphs 6-10)By Foo Yun CheeBRUSSELS, March 9 Teva Pharmaceutical Industries  is expected to win EU antitrust approval for its $40.5 billion bid for Allergan's generics unit after agreeing to sell off some of its products to appease regulators, three people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.Teva, the world's biggest generic drugsmaker, will divest some drugs already on the market and others in the pipeline to address competition concerns by the European Commission, the people said. The package includes products from both Teva and Allergan.Other sources had previously told Reuters that assets worth about $1 billion in the United States, Europe and the Middle East would be sold in order to secure the green light from regulators. Teva will gain bigger economies of scale, a crucial element in the low-margin generic drugs business, with the deal, the largest in Israel's corporate history.The Commission, which is scheduled to decide on the case on Thursday, did not reply immediately to an email for comment. Teva declined to comment. Shares of Teva closed up 3 percent to $57.90 on the New York Stock Exchange, outpacing a 0.7 percent gain for the ARCA Pharmaceutical Index of large drugmakers.Morningstar analyst Michael Waterhouse said Allergan's generics business ranks as one of the best in the industry and will considerably strengthen Teva's extensive product line.Teva will gain a number of products from Allergan that have less competition, and therefore more stable pricing, than typical generics, Waterhouse said. They include formulations of Johnson & Johnson's Concerta treatment for attention deficit disorder. Wells Fargo analyst David Maris said he expects the Teva-Allergan deal to be completed in April, after winning approvals from EU and U.S. regulators.""We see no hurdles to the deal closing as expected,"" Maris said. Teva, which has extensive sales forces in Europe and the United States, will obtain big cost savings by having more products to sell through its existing infrastructure, he added.The deal has triggered a warning from the American Antitrust Institute that a more concentrated generic market usually comes with higher prices. The think-tank also said divestments may not be enough to ensure competition in the market in a letter to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission in January.Dublin-based Botox-maker Allergan in turn is slated to be acquired later this year by Pfizer Inc in a $160 billion deal, creating the world's largest drugmaker.

551,"   By Pamela Barbaglia  Drugmaker Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) is leaning toward abandoning its $160 billion agreement to buy Allergan Plc (AGN.N) in light of the U.S. Treasury's new measures to curb such tax evading deals, a source familiar with the situation said on Tuesday.The discussions between the two companies and their lawyers are set to continue for the remainder of Tuesday and no final decision has been made, the source said, speaking on condition of anonymity. However, Pfizer is not willing to change the terms of its deal with Allergan which, under the new tax rules, would no longer benefit from the move to Ireland, the source said.Pfizer and Allergan declined to comment.The U.S. Treasury Department took new steps on Monday to curb tax-driven corporate inversions whereby companies seek to slash their tax bills by redomiciling overseas, though their core operations and management usually remain in the United States even as they claim a new tax home.Pfizer is concerned U.S. President Barack Obama's administration could change the rules again to thwart a deal. The source said the company's lawyers have presented alternative ways for the two companies to salvage the inversion but there was little appetite for it.""Pfizer is aware that the Treasury will keep ruling against any solution it can come up with,"" he said.One of the main hurdles to the deal was Treasury's decision impose a three-year limit on foreign companies bulking up on U.S. assets to avoid ownership limits for a later inversion deal. This means Allergan's latest deals -- which include the $66 billion merger of Allergan Plc and Actavis Plc, the $25 billion purchase of Forest Laboratories and the $5 billion takeover of Warner Chilcott - will not be counted and the business will fail to meet the ownership math for the deal.The source said the new rules came as a surprise as Pfizer was confident of delivering on its $160 billion proposed merger with Allergan. He said the management was rather expecting the Treasury to rule against inversions toward the end of last year when the two companies were looking at ways to bypass the existing law.     Pfizer and Allergan have always had an exit strategy in place, the source said. The two drugmakers agreed that either party may terminate the deal if an adverse change in U.S. law would cause the combined company to be treated as a U.S. domestic corporation for federal income tax purposes. The terminating party would have to pay the other company up to $400 million for its expenses, according to the merger agreement.Pfizer's Chief Executive Ian Read has tirelessly worked to find a merger partner and redomicile the business in Europe since dropping a takeover bid for British drugmaker AstraZeneca (AZN.L) in 2014.The source said Read firmly believes in the industrial logic of a deal with Allergan and the tax savings that the combined entity would achieve, but he has been put off by the Treasury's latest measures and is unwilling to fight a legal battle with the U.S. authorities.

552,"   By Chuck Mikolajczak | NEW YORK  NEW YORK The dollar fell on Tuesday to touch its weakest level against the yen since October 2014 and stock markets worldwide slumped as economic data out of Europe and the United States prompted a retreat from riskier assets. The Japanese currency, often sought in times of market turmoil or economic uncertainty, strengthened. Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda, speaking to parliament on Tuesday, stressed his readiness to expand monetary policy, such as pushing interest rates further into negative territory. Wall Street followed declines across Europe and Asia. The MSCI All-World Index .MIWD00000PUS dropped 1.4 percent, on target for its worst day since early February. In New York, shares of Dublin-based Allergan (AGN.N) were hammered after the U.S. Treasury Department on Monday unveiled rules designed to curb corporate tax inversion mergers that could possibly stymie the company's tie-up with New York-based Pfizer Inc (PFE.N). A source told Reuters that Pfizer was leaning toward abandoning, not altering, the deal.Allergan shares slumped nearly 15 percent, their biggest percentage drop in nearly 12 years, and were the worst performer on the S&P 500. Pfizer shares rose 2.1 percent.The U.S. trade deficit widened more than expected in February in the latest indication that economic growth weakened further in the first quarter, although other data suggested the economic growth picture could improve in the months ahead.  ""The mix of global growth being perhaps a bit slower and a more gradual path for the U.S. fed funds rate... are likely positive for the yen,"" said Brian Daingerfield, currency strategist for RBS Securities in Stamford, Connecticut.The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI fell 133.68 points, or 0.75 percent, to 17,603.32, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 20.96 points, or 1.01 percent, to 2,045.17 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 47.86 points, or 0.98 percent, to 4,843.93.In Europe, the FTSEurofirst 300 share index .FTEU3 dropped 1.9 percent. Germany's DAX index .GDAXI slid 2.6 percent after data showed industrial orders in Germany, Europe's largest economy, unexpectedly fell 2.1 percent in February. Further muddying the waters for investors, two senior officials of the U.S. Federal Reserve said the market's views of when the central bank would raise interest rates may be too pessimistic.Fed Chair Janet Yellen said just last week the U.S. central bank would proceed cautiously in raising rates. Those remarks were viewed as dovish and sent U.S. stocks to their highest levels of the year so far.The dollar fell as low as 109.94 against the yen JPY= and was last down 0.87 percent at 110.34 yen.  Oil steadied after Kuwait said an output freeze by major oil producers would proceed without Iran. Brent crude LCOc1 gained 18 cents to settle at $37.87 a barrel, while U.S. crude CLc1 settled up 19 cents at $35.89 a barrel.    Yields on low-risk government bonds fell.

553,"   By Caroline Humer and Ransdell Pierson | NEW YORK  NEW YORK The U.S. Treasury Department's proposed new tax regulations threw a series of corporate mergers into question on Tuesday, fanning a hot political situation and pushing Pfizer Inc closer to a decision to walk away from buying Botox maker Allergan Plc.Pfizer is leaning towards abandoning its $160 billion agreement to buy Allergan in light of the U.S. Treasury's new measures to curb tax-evading deals, a source familiar with the situation said on Tuesday.Pfizer is not willing to change the terms of its deal with Allergan which, under the new tax rules, would no longer benefit from the move to Ireland, the source said.U.S. President Obama on Tuesday called global tax avoidance a ""huge problem"" and urged Congress to take action to stop U.S. companies from tax-avoiding corporate ""inversions"", which lower companies tax bills by redomiciling overseas.""While the Treasury Department's actions will make it more difficult ... to exploit this particular corporate inversions loophole, only Congress can close it for good,"" Obama said.Besides Pfizer-Allergan, deals that could be affected by the new rules include the proposed $16.5 billion merger of Johnson Controls Inc with Ireland-based Tyco International PlcJohnson Controls said it is reviewing the regulations. Tyco did not immediately reply to a request comment.Waste Connections Inc and Canada's Progressive Waste Solutions Ltd said on Tuesday they will go ahead with their $2.67 billion deal. Both companies' shares fell.ALLERGAN SHARES PLUNGE The largest among the affected deals is Pfizer's plan to buy Dublin-based Allergan, move its headquarters to Ireland, and lower its tax rate. Allergan shares were down 15.4 percent at $234.94 in the busiest trading day in company history. Pfizer shares rose 2 percent to $31.33.Discussions between the two companies and their lawyers are set to continue Tuesday and no final decision has been made, the source said, speaking on condition of anonymity.Pfizer, which announced the deal in November, has said its tax rate would drop to about 17 or 18 percent after the deal, from around 25 percent. That would represent more than $1 billion in annual cost savings.On Monday night, Pfizer and Allergan said in a joint statement that they were reviewing the notice and declined to speculate on whether the deal would go forward.Allergan's bonds sold off in heavy trading on expectations the deal would fall through and that Allergan would not get the credit ratings lift that market players had expected by its merger with Pfizer.Trading activity in Allergan and Pfizer options surged to several times normal. Shares of M&A advisory firms, meanwhile, tumbled in response to the new U.S. inversion rules. The S&P 600 Investment Banking & Brokerage Index lost 2.9 percent, M&A advisor Evercore Partners fell 4.7 percent, while Greenhill & Co  was down 4.5 percent.HOT POLITICAL ISSUE The federal government has grappled with a wave of inversions in recent years as U.S. companies seek to slash their tax bills by redomiciling overseas, although their core operations and management usually remain in the United States even as they claim a new tax home.Late on Monday, the Treasury Department introduced a regulation that would negate the benefits of inversions.Treasury said it will impose a three-year limit on foreign companies bulking up on U.S. assets to avoid ownership limits for a later inversion deal. Allergan's key deals in the prior 36 months include the $66 billion merger with Actavis Plc and the $25 billion purchase of Forest Laboratories. Several U.S. presidential candidates, including Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton, have seized on the issue in their campaigns.""We have so many companies leaving, it is disgraceful,""  Trump told reporters as he greeted voters in Waukesha, Wisconsin.Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders both expressed support for Treasury's plan.NEXT STEPS? If Pfizer does not acquire Allergan's new, fast-growing medicines, Pfizer will need to look for other companies with attractive products, such as U.S. drugmakers Biogen Inc , Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc and AbbVie Inc , said Raghuram Selvaraju, managing director of brokerage H.C. Wainwright.Morningstar analyst Damien Conover said if the deal collapses, Pfizer will likely move up its decision on a key business strategy - whether to sell or spin off its hundreds of generic medicines.Pfizer had planned to make a decision by 2016 whether to split off its generics, but delayed the decision until 2019 after announcing its merger with Allergan. Conover said the decision could be moved to late 2017 or 2018.Jeff Jonas, a portfolio manager at Gabelli funds which owns Allergan shares, said Allergan stock was falling as merger-related investors sold out, but that Allergan as a standalone company is attractive.""They've been very successful as an acquirer over the years, making smart deals, not overpaying for them, integrating them well and making them work. They just get back to that,"" Jonas said. He said he thinks Allergan is worth about $250 per share.(Additional reporting by Bill Berkrot, Steve Holland, Mike Stone, Natalie Harrison, Meredith Davis in Chicago, Lindsay Dunsmuir and Amanda Becker)",2016-04-05,AGN,"Tue Apr 5, 2016 | 2:45pm EDT",U.S. Treasury rules put Pfizer-Allergan deal in question,http://www.reuters.com//article/allergan-ma-pfizer-idUSL2N1781FF?type=companyNews
554,"  NEW YORK, April 5 Shares in Allergan Plc  opened down more than 15 percent on Tuesday, a day after the U.S. Treasury Department proposed new tax regulations that analysts said could kill its $160 billion agreement to be bought by Pfizer Inc.Pfizer's deal to buy Dublin-based Allergan was conceived under rules that would have allowed the company to move its headquarters to Ireland and lower its tax rate. The government has been trying to stop that type of deal, called a tax inversion.Late on Monday, the Treasury Department introduced a regulation that would negate the tax benefits of Pfizer's acquisition of Allergan. Allergan shares were trading down 15.3 percent at $235 on the New York Stock Exchange. Pfizer shares rose 1.6 percent to $31.20.""By how the stocks are trading, the market thinks the deal is almost dead,"" said Les Funtleyder, healthcare portfolio manager at E Squared Asset Management in New York, whose firm holds Pfizer shares. On Monday night, Pfizer said that it was reviewing the notice and declined to speculate on whether the deal would go forward. ""To us, whether Pfizer and Allergan stay committed will be known shortly - more important for many is if the deal breaks, where should Allergan trade?""

555,"   By Caroline Humer and Ankur Banerjee  U.S. drugmaker Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) and Ireland-based Allergan Plc (AGN.N) walked away from their $160 billion merger on Wednesday, a major win for President Barack Obama, who has been pushing to curb deals in which companies move overseas to cut taxes.Pfizer said the decision was driven by new U.S. Treasury rules aimed at such deals, called inversions. The merger would have allowed New York-based Pfizer to cut its tax bill by an estimated $1 billion annually by domiciling in Ireland, where tax rates are lower.While the new Treasury rules did not name Pfizer and Allergan, one of the provisions targeted a specific feature of their merger - Allergan's history as a major acquirer of other companies.Allergan Chief Executive Brent Saunders said on CNBC television that the new Treasury rule would not stop the company from doing other stock-based acquisitions as soon as this fall. The new Treasury rule takes into account the past three years of a company's deals.""It really looked like they did a very fine job at constructing a temporary rule to stop this deal and obviously it was successful,"" Saunders said. Saunders said that he would stay to run the standalone company with a focus on both deals and research and development. Allergan will also move ahead with plans for its $40.5 billion sale of its generic drug business to Israel's Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA.TA). It expects the transaction to close by June.With the deal behind it, Pfizer said it would decide this year about whether to split off its hundreds of generic medicines into a separate business. It had put off making that decision until 2019 after announcing its deal with Allergan last November.Pfizer will pay Allergan $150 million to reimburse expenses from its deal. Shares of Allergan, which fell 15 percent on Tuesday, were up 3.3 percent at $244.38 at mid-afternoon. Pfizer rose 4.7 percent to $32.84. Pfizer has new products coming and plenty of money that it could put to work with acquisitions, though not on the scale of Allergan, said Les Funtleyder, healthcare portfolio manager at E Squared Asset Management in New York, which holds Pfizer shares. It is not clear that Pfizer should definitely split into two, he said.""It is true that these larger companies are a little unwieldy to manage,"" Funtleyder said, ""but there are plenty of strategies to keep them together and increase shareholder value.""     The decision to call off the deal came in part because Pfizer was concerned that any tweaks to salvage its deal with Allergan might have provoked new rules by the Treasury, a source familiar with the situation told Reuters on Tuesday.Obama on Tuesday called global tax avoidance a ""huge problem"" and urged Congress to take action to stop U.S. companies from deals that allow it.U.S. inversion rules have unraveled other mergers. U.S. drugmaker AbbVie Inc (ABBV.N) abandoned its $55 billion takeover of Ireland-domiciled peer Shire Plc (SHP.L) in 2014 after the Obama administration cracked down on inversions. AbbVie had to pay Shire a $1.6 billion break-up fee.

558,"   By Caroline Valetkevitch  U.S. stocks jumped on Wednesday, bolstered by gains in healthcare shares after the collapse of the $160 billion merger of Pfizer and Allergan, and by a rise in energy shares.Minutes from the most recent Federal Reserve meeting suggested the Fed was unlikely to raise interest rates before June. U.S. drugmaker Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) and Ireland-based Allergan Plc (AGN.N) called off their merger after new U.S. Treasury rules aimed at curbing tax-cutting inversion deals. News of the merger's breakup boosted the healthcare sector on hopes that the pharmaceutical giants could turn to smaller targets. The S&P healthcare index .SPXHC gained 2.7 percent, while the Nasdaq Biotech Index .NBI jumped 6 percent. Shares of Pfizer rose 5 percent to $32.93 and gave the biggest boost to the S&P 500, while Allergan was up 3.5 percent at $244.74.""I guess the feeling is Pfizer will now look for a new target,"" said Stephen Massocca, chief investment officer, Wedbush Equity Management LLC in San Francisco. But, he said, ""the rally in healthcare is a little counter-intuitive, given the political climate seems to be negative for big pharma right now."" The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI was up 112.73 points, or 0.64 percent, to 17,716.05, the S&P 500 .SPX had gained 21.49 points, or 1.05 percent, to 2,066.66 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC had added 76.78 points, or 1.59 percent, to 4,920.72.Crude oil jumped after data showed an unexpected draw in U.S. stockpiles last week, boosting shares of energy companies. The S&P 500 energy index .SPNY rose 2.1 percent.The day's rally, which included gains in all but two sectors, followed two days of declines in the S&P 500. The index had rallied 13 percent in the previous seven weeks, thanks to stabilizing oil prices and reduced concerns about China's economy.  Investors will soon turn their attention to first-quarter S&P 500 earnings, which are estimated to be down 7.4 percent from a year ago, according to Thomson Reuters data.Some strategists see further gains in the market if companies are able to handily beat such low earnings expectations.Federal Reserve policymakers debated whether they might hike rates in April but ""a number"" of them argued headwinds to growth would probably persist, with many arguing they should be cautious about raising rates. ""I don't think there was anything particularly surprising there. We knew from earlier comments immediately following (the meeting) that there was some dissension,"" Massocca said.About 6.9 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, below the 7.2 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days, according to Thomson Reuters data.Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by 2,286 to 734, for a 3.11-to-1 ratio on the upside; on the Nasdaq, 2,003 issues rose and 789 fell for a 2.54-to-1 ratio favoring advancers.The S&P 500 posted 12 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq recorded 35 new highs and 21 new lows.

559,"  * Pfizer, Allergan lead gains in healthcare sector* Oil gains boost energy sector* Indexes up: Dow 0.2 pct, S&P 0.5 pct, Nasdaq 1 pct   (Updates to after Fed minutes)By Caroline ValetkevitchApril 6 U.S. stocks rose on Wednesday, bolstered by gains in healthcare shares after the collapse of the $160 billion merger of Pfizer and Allergan, and by a rise in energy shares. Indexes slightly pared gains after the release of minutes from the most recent Federal Reserve meeting. They showed policymakers debated last month whether an interest rate hike would be needed in April, though a consensus emerged that risks from a global economic slowdown warranted a cautious approach.""The minutes were a little more hawkish than the tone that we've heard from (Fed Chair Janet) Yellen post-FOMC meeting, but that was to be expected somewhat in my view,"" said Scott Smith, senior market analyst at Cambridge global Payments in Toronto.Investors have been grappling with mixed signals from Fed officials, including comments from Yellen last week that eased anxiety about potential interest rate hikes. The collapse of the Pfizer and Allergan merger bolstered the healthcare sector on hopes that the pharmaceutical giants could turn to smaller targets.Pfizer shares rose 3.9 percent to $32.57 and gave the biggest boost to the S&P 500, while Allergan was up 3.6 percent at $245.05. The S&P healthcare index was up 2.2 percent, while the Nasdaq Biotech Index jumped 4.8 percent. At 2:52 p.m. the Dow Jones industrial average was up 28.39 points, or 0.16 percent, to 17,631.71, the S&P 500  gained 10.61 points, or 0.52 percent, to 2,055.78 and the Nasdaq Composite added 47.28 points, or 0.98 percent, to 4,891.21.Crude jumped after data showed an unexpected draw in U.S. crude stockpiles last week, boosting shares of energy companies.Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by 1,898 to 1,074, for a 1.77-to-1 ratio on the upside; on the Nasdaq, 1,748 issues rose and 991 fell for a 1.76-to-1 ratio favoring advancers.The S&P 500 posted 10 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq recorded 29 new highs and 18 new lows.

562,"   By Caroline Humer and Ankur Banerjee  U.S. drugmaker Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) and Ireland-based Allergan Plc (AGN.N) walked away from their $160 billion merger on Wednesday, a major win for President Barack Obama, who has been pushing to curb deals in which companies move overseas to cut taxes.Pfizer said the decision was driven by new U.S. Treasury rules aimed at such deals, called inversions. The merger would have allowed New York-based Pfizer to cut its tax bill by an estimated $1 billion annually by domiciling in Ireland, where tax rates are lower.While the new Treasury rules did not name Pfizer and Allergan, one of the provisions targeted a specific feature of their merger - Allergan's history as a major acquirer of other companies.Allergan Chief Executive Brent Saunders said on CNBC television that the new Treasury rule would not stop the company from doing other stock-based acquisitions as soon as this fall. The new Treasury rule takes into account the past three years of a company's deals.""It really looked like they did a very fine job at constructing a temporary rule to stop this deal and obviously it was successful,"" Saunders said. Saunders said that he would stay to run the standalone company with a focus on both deals and research and development. Allergan will also move ahead with plans for its $40.5 billion sale of its generic drug business to Israel's Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA.TA). It expects the transaction to close by June.With the deal behind it, Pfizer said it would decide this year about whether to split off its hundreds of generic medicines into a separate business. It had put off making that decision until 2019 after announcing its deal with Allergan last November.Pfizer will pay Allergan $150 million to reimburse expenses from its deal. Shares of Allergan, which fell 15 percent on Tuesday, were up 3.3 percent at $244.38 at mid-afternoon. Pfizer rose 4.7 percent to $32.84. Pfizer has new products coming and plenty of money that it could put to work with acquisitions, though not on the scale of Allergan, said Les Funtleyder, healthcare portfolio manager at E Squared Asset Management in New York, which holds Pfizer shares. It is not clear that Pfizer should definitely split into two, he said.""It is true that these larger companies are a little unwieldy to manage,"" Funtleyder said, ""but there are plenty of strategies to keep them together and increase shareholder value.""     The decision to call off the deal came in part because Pfizer was concerned that any tweaks to salvage its deal with Allergan might have provoked new rules by the Treasury, a source familiar with the situation told Reuters on Tuesday.Obama on Tuesday called global tax avoidance a ""huge problem"" and urged Congress to take action to stop U.S. companies from deals that allow it.U.S. inversion rules have unraveled other mergers. U.S. drugmaker AbbVie Inc (ABBV.N) abandoned its $55 billion takeover of Ireland-domiciled peer Shire Plc (SHP.L) in 2014 after the Obama administration cracked down on inversions. AbbVie had to pay Shire a $1.6 billion break-up fee.

The minutes are due at 2 p.m. ET (1600 GMT). The collapse of the $160 billion merger of Pfizer and Allergan bolstered the healthcare sector on rising hopes that the pharmaceutical giants could turn to smaller targets.Pfizer shares rose 3.9 percent to $32.57 and gave the biggest boost to the S&P 500, while Allergan was up 3.6 percent at $245.05.Crude jumped nearly 5 percent after data showed an unexpected draw in U.S. crude stockpiles last week. A seven-week rally - sparked by rising oil, strength in the economy and a cautious Fed - helped stocks recover from a steep selloff that had sent the S&P 500 down more than 10 percent earlier this year. The index closed flat for 2016 on Tuesday.""We're still technically in a declining environment, and we have to get to an all-time high before we can give the all-clear signal,"" said Sam Stovall, U.S. equity strategist at S&P Global Market Intelligence in New York.Stovall said better-than-expected corporate earnings could provide the catalyst to drive stocks higher that investors were looking for. S&P 500 companies on average are expected to report a 7.4 percent fall in first-quarter earnings, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.At 12:48 p.m. ET (1648 GMT), the Dow Jones industrial average was up 68.15 points, or 0.39 percent, at 17,671.47, the S&P 500 was up 13.25 points, or 0.65 percent, at 2,058.42 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 49.43 points, or 1.02 percent, at 4,893.36.Seven of the 10 major S&P sectors were higher, led by a 2.09 percent rise in energy.

Teva said in March that a regulatory review of the deal by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission was taking longer than anticipated, and that it expected the transaction to be completed by June. Teva has found buyers for nearly all of the assets it expects to divest, which could be worth as much as $2 billion in total, the source said on Thursday. They include around 50 drugs already on the market and 25 in development that treat illnesses ranging from cancer to respiratory disease and central nervous system disorders, the source said.Teva is still on track to close the deal next month, the source added, asking not to be identified because the latest developments are not public. Teva declined to comment, Allergan did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Finalizing a divestiture plan does not guarantee approval from the FTC, which can sometimes surprise companies by making demands for additional asset sales or proclaim that a transaction is anti-competitive. Teva's deal with Allergan has been cleared by European antitrust regulators. In July, Teva agreed to buy the generics portfolio of Allergan, solidfying Teva's position as the world's largest generic manufacturer. For Allergan, the transaction will help focus its business on brand-name drugs and provide a massive war chest for future acquisitions. Allergan had subsequently agreed to a $160 billion takeover by larger player Pfizer Inc, but the deal was derailed last month by the U.S. Treasury which introduced rules that eliminated tax benefits central to the transaction. Investors and industry analysts expect Allergan will look for new acquisition targets once the sale to Teva is completed. Teva is still in the process of finding buyers for one set of assets, a bundle of drugs in various stages of development worth about $500 million, but expects to agree to a deal as soon as next week, the source said. The source would not provide details on the buyers.

580,"   By Amrutha Penumudi and Ransdell Pierson  Allergan Plc (AGN.N), whose $160 billion merger with Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) collapsed last month, reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit and said it would buy back up to $10 billion in company stock, helping lift its shares 4 percent.The Dublin drugmaker on Tuesday said the planned $40 billion sale of its generics business to Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA.TA) will close next month and that it will use $8 billion of the money to pay down company debt. Since the U.S. government torpedoed the merger, a deal that would have relocated Pfizer's legal domicile to Ireland to reduce Pfizer's taxes, investors have speculated Allergan might use the Teva proceeds for sizeable new deals.However, Allergan Chief Executive Brent Saunders, in a conference call with industry analysts, said he was more interested for now in ""stepping stone deals"" valued at up to a few billion dollars meant to bolster the company's existing disease areas.Allergan, known as Actavis Inc until it bought Botox-maker Allergan Inc last year and took on its name, said it expects to buy back $4 billion to $5 billion of its shares over the next four to six months and would consider more stock repurchases if  market conditions allow. The company's market value is currently $84.4 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data. Excluding special items, the company earned $3.04 per share in the first quarter, topping the average analysts' estimate of $3.01 largely because of lower than expected research spending.Up to Monday's close of $213.71, Allergan's stock had fallen about 23 percent since Pfizer scrapped the merger, which would have been the biggest-ever in the pharmaceutical industry.The deal collapsed after the U.S. Treasury issued new rules curbing tax inversions, or moves by American companies to relocate their domicile overseas to cut taxes. ""With this highly controversial quarter now in the rear view mirror, we see an attractive setup in Allergan shares going forward based on a combination of attractive valuation, ongoing healthy organic growth and significant capital deployment optionality,"" said JP Morgan analyst Chris Schott.Revenue in its U.S. brands business, including Botox, rose 27.3 percent to $2.30 billion. The unit accounts for about 60 percent of the company's total revenue. The company reported net income of $186.1 million, or 47 cents per share, compared with a loss of $535.2 million, or $1.85 per share, a year earlier. Total revenue rose 48 percent to $3.80 billion, below Wall Street's expectations of $3.95 billion.Revenue fell in the company's generic distribution unit, which lost business from Target Corp's (TGT.N) in-store pharmacies after they were acquired by CVS Health (CVS.N).

Eric Mindich's Eton Park bought 926,504 shares and Lee Ainslie's Maverick Capital bought 730,432 shares. Adage Capital Partners nearly doubled its holdings, buying 547,759 shares to hold 1.2 million shares.The investments came weeks after Allergan agreed with rival Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) in November to a merger that was valued at more than $150 billion. But their bet that the two companies would become the world's biggest pharmaceutical company was wrong as the deal collapsed in early April and Allergan's stock dropped.The merger derailed due to U.S. Treasury action to curb inversions or where companies move abroad to cut taxes. Some investors trimmed their Allergan stakes in the first quarter. Viking Global Investors cut it by 18 percent to own 4.8 million shares at the end of the quarter. Senator Investment Group cut its position by more than half when it sold 875,000 shares and Third Point trimmed its holding by selling 400,000 shares to own 5 million. Jana Partners cut its stake by 718,000 shares to 447,000 shares and Omega Advisors cut its stake by about 221,000 shares to 561,000 shares.  Hoplite Capital cut its stake by roughly half to own 299,825 shares.

641,"   By Svea Herbst-Bayliss | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Daniel Loeb's $16 billion Third Point LLC said on Tuesday that the firm's investments in energy credits drove positive returns during the first half of the year and is devoting over $1 billion to energy corporate credits.""We came into the year with a short credit portfolio that we reversed sharply in February, getting long over $1B in energy credit,"" Third Point said in its latest quarterly letter to clients.  According to the letter, Third Point's Offshore Fund posted returns of 4.6 percent during the second quarter ended June 30, compared with the Standard & Poor's 500 which returned 2.5 percent. Third Point, overseen by Loeb who is one of the industry's most closely followed investors in part because of his record where he has delivered an average 16 percent return every year since launching his firm in 1996, said the firm reduced ""more concentrated long investments"" in health care. Third Point sold out of its stake in Amgen Inc because ""we saw better opportunities elsewhere,"" the letter said. Third Point also said the firm continued to hold its Allergan stake. Its largest investment in the portfolio - Baxter International, a global manufacturer and supplier of health care products - has generated a nearly 20 percent internal rate of return (IRR) since its inception last June. ""Despite this meaningful move in performance, its current size is consistent with our conviction about the company and its leadership and the potential we see for meaningful upside from these levels,"" Third Point said.Third Point has reduced its structured credit book of housing-related bonds from its highs and focused increasingly on new areas of opportunity in consumer lending, the letter said.  ""The year's positive performance reflects contributions from nearly all of the strategies we employ; the top five winners include a constructive long equity position, a sovereign debt investment, high-yield debt investments in energy companies, an event-driven long position, and a short equity position in the pharmaceutical industry,"" Third Point said.Overall, Third Point's bet on energy credits is paying off handsomely. Third Point said it sensed a bottom in energy around mid-February, with rumors swirling around Chesapeake's imminent Chapter 11 filing and another rumor that OPEC was willing to cut production. ""This led oil prices to bottom, finally,"" Third Point said.Third Point said it is currently focused on debt of ""companies with high-quality assets and deleveraging catalysts where we can make good returns while limiting downside risk should commodity prices stagnate.""

642,"  WASHINGTON Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (TEVA.TA) won U.S. antitrust approval to purchase Allergan Plc's (AGN.N) generics business, after agreeing to divest 79 generic drugs to rival firms, the Federal Trade Commission said on Wednesday. The $40.5 billion deal, which was announced in July 2015, solidifies Teva's position as the world's No. 1 maker of generics while freeing Allergan to focus on branded drugs.Teva will sell rights and assets related to the 79 pharmaceutical products to 11 rival firms, marking the largest ever drug divestiture order in an FTC pharmaceutical merger case, the commission said in a statement.Generics, drugs on which patents have expired and typically a source of healthcare savings, have made headlines over the past year as some drugmakers sharply raised prices on medications with few competitors.“Millions of Americans rely daily on generic drugs to treat a wide range of illnesses,” Debbie Feinstein, director of the FTC’s Bureau of Competition, said in the statement. “The FTC’s settlement safeguards the competitive availability of these medications for patients across the country who depend on them,” she added.Products being sold include anesthetics, antibiotics, weight-loss drugs, oral contraceptives and treatments for a wide variety of diseases and conditions, the statement said.The acquirers of the divested drugs are Mayne Pharma Group Ltd (MYX.AX), Impax Laboratories Inc (IPXL.O), Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd (RDY.N), Sagent Pharmaceuticals Inc SGNT.O, Cipla Ltd  (CIPL.NS), Zydus Worldwide, Mikah Pharma, Perrigo Pharma International PRGO.O, Aurobindo Pharma (ARBN.NS), Prasco LLC and 3M Co (MMM.N), according to the FTC. There has been an unprecedented wave of deals in the healthcare sector since early 2014, from large drugmakers buying up smaller rivals, to consolidation among makers of generic medicines and tie-ups between insurers.Teva, which expects to close the transaction next week, said the combined company will have about 338 product registrations pending U.S. regulatory approval and will hold the leading position as the initial market entrant for around 115 pending U.S. generic drug applications. Chief Executive Erez Vigodam said in a statement that the deal will generate $1.4 billion in operational and tax savings by the end of 2019 and raise adjusted earnings by 14 percent next year.

Allergan was unlikely to pursue the deal, CNBC said, citing a source.Biogen shares closed up 9.4 percent at $330.11 on Tuesday, valuing the company at about $72.33 billion. The stock fell 1.3 percent in extended trade following the CNBC report. Officials at Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Biogen could not be reached for comment. Allergan spokesman Mark Marmur and Merck spokeswoman Lainie Keller said they do not comment on speculation.The WSJ report came less than two weeks after Biogen reported surprisingly strong second-quarter earnings but said Chief Executive George Scangos, 68, would step down in coming months after a successor is found. Although Biogen significantly raised its full-year earnings forecast, growth for its flagship Tecfidera treatment for multiple sclerosis has been slowing. The slowdown prompted the company last year to embark on a sweeping restructuring program to cut costs and focus on core areas, such as neurology, including treatments for Alzheimer's disease.Leerink Partners analyst Geoffrey Porges said Merck, Allergan or other large drugmakers would benefit from acquiring Biogen and its experimental drugs in late-stage trials, which include treatments for Alzheimer's, multiple sclerosis and spinal muscular atrophy. ""There's a scarcity of assets in the industry,"" Porges said. ""The industry needs to bulk up and consolidate and neither Merck nor Allergan have a multiple sclerosis business today,"" he said, while Biogen is leading the field.

651,"   By Ransdell Pierson  Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) reported better-than-expected quarterly results, driven by lower taxes and sales of generic medicines, but revenue from its branded patent-protected medicines brought disappointment.The largest U.S. drugmaker did not offer any hints on whether it plans to split into two separate companies, a long-mulled potential decision that has kept investors in suspense. Pfizer, whose shares fell 2.3 percent in morning trading, said second quarter revenue rose 11 percent to $13.15 billion, topping the average analyst estimate of $13.01 billion.Sales of generic medicines rose 16 percent to $6.04 billion, helped by Pfizer's $16 billion purchase last year of generic hospital products company Hospira. Although generics beat expectations, BMO Capital Markets analyst Alex Arfaei said sales of Hospira products, at $1.14 billion, were 7 percent below his forecast, and suggested ""limited revenue synergies"" from that acquisition.Sales of Pfizer's patent-protected drugs rose 7 percent to $7.11 billion, 2 percent below Arfaei's estimate.     Higher sales of nerve-pain drug Lyrica helped offset disappointing sales of its Prevnar vaccine for pneumococcal infections.In April, Pfizer terminated a $160 billion deal to acquire Irish drugmaker Allergan Plc (AGN.N) after the U.S. Treasury Department issued new rules restricting tax inversion transactions aimed at slashing taxes.With collapse of the deal, investors have shifted their focus to whether Pfizer will break up, creating one company specializing in patent-protected drugs and another geared toward branded generic drugs. Pfizer for several years has weighed whether such a split makes sense, largely because its patent-protected medicines routinely enjoy sales growth, while its portfolio of generics usually post declines. Pfizer Chief Executive Officer Ian Read on Tuesday said the company will decide by year end. ""We're presenting all the pros and cons to our board.""

Drugs for uterine fibroids, dry eye, major depressive disorder and migraines are among those ""not getting the credit they deserve"" for their potential, said Brian Turner, principal at Allergan shareholder Levin Capital Strategies.""They already have an existing pipeline,"" Turner said.

660,"   By Steven Scheer | JERUSALEM  JERUSALEM Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA.TA) will remain in the hunt for more acquisitions after completing a deal to buy Allergan's (AGN.N) generics business for $40.5 billion this week.Teva expects to generate free cash flow of more than $25 billion through 2019 from the integration of Actavis, $5 billion of which will go towards dividend payouts.""The rest will be divided between paying down debt and entertaining attractive specialty deals,"" Erez Vidogman, Teva's chief executive, told a conference call of analysts following the publication of second-quarter results.The deal, announced in July last year and partly financed by bond offerings totalling more than $20 billion, solidifies Israel-based Teva's position as the world's No. 1 maker of generics. Teva this week also bought Allergan's Anda Inc distribution for $500 million.It now seeks to expand further into the branded segment.Its own blockbuster multiple sclerosis treatment Copaxone has 30 percent of the U.S. market, the company said. It expects to launch a drug to treat Huntington's disease next year. In the second quarter, specialty drug revenue rose 9 percent to $2.3 billion.Teva's generics drug revenue fell 7 percent to $2.3 billion, led by a 33 percent drop in the United States. But Copaxone recorded an 8 percent rise in sales to $1.1 billion.The drug, which Teva said accounts for about 22 percent of revenue and 47 percent of its profit, faces competition. Sandoz, part of Swiss Novartis AG (NOVN.S), and Momenta Pharmaceuticals (MNTA.O) last year launched a once-daily 20 mg version called Glatopa, which had sales of $20.7 million in the second quarter.To minimize the damage, Teva has been shifting MS patients from a daily 20 mg dose to a three times a week 40 mg and Teva's patent on the higher dosage is being challenged in court. Sandoz and Momenta are vying for approval to sell such a version.Teva holds five patents on Copaxone and believes they will be upheld. ""Any generic launch prior to a final non-appealable court ruling on all five patents, which is not expected before the second half of 2018, would be at risk"" to legal action, Vigodman said.Teva posted earnings per share excluding one-time items of $1.25 per share, down from $1.43 a year earlier. Revenue grew 1 percent to $5.0 billion. Vigodman said Teva's main focus would be on integrating Actavis but also on delivering on its operational and financial targets and on development and commercialisation of more than 35 products in its pipeline.The company reaffirmed it expects 2016 revenue of $22-$22.5 billion and adjusted EPS of $5.20-$5.40. Last month it provided a financial outlook through 2019.Teva declared a cash dividend of 34 cents a share for the second quarter, the same as the previous three months.Its New York-listed shares were 1.2 percent higher in morning trading at $54.22.

661,"  JERUSALEM Aug 4 Teva Pharmaceutical Industries  will focus on the integration of Allergan's  generics business into its operations, it said on Thursday, after completing the $40.5 billion deal this week.The deal, which was announced in July last year, solidifies Israel-based Teva's position as the world's No. 1 maker of generics.Besides integrating Actavis, Teva Chief Executive Erez Vigodman also said the company would focus on delivering on its operational and financial targets and on development and commercialization of more than 35 products in its pipeline.Teva posted earnings per share excluding one-time items of $1.25 per share, down from $1.43 a year earlier.

662,"   By Ransdell Pierson  Allergan Plc's (AGN.N) chief executive officer said on Monday he is not interested in using the drugmaker's cash pile for big deals, one week after selling its generics business for $40.5 billion.Wall Street has been looking for clues as to when Allergan CEO Brent Saunders would target a big acquisition to gain pharmaceutical or dermatology products with growth potential.But the seasoned dealmaker dampened those hopes on Monday during a conference call with analysts to discuss the company's second-quarter results, saying he was in no hurry to complete a big transaction. After paying down debt, Allergan said it now holds $27.6 billion in cash.  When asked if he was interested in buying U.S. biotechnology company Biogen Inc (BIIB.O), which was widely reported last week, Saunders said the company was focused more on ""stepping stones.""""We are not looking at and we are not focused on any large transformational M&A,"" Saunders said. Later on the call, he said that if an extraordinary situation presented itself, Allergan would obviously look at it, but that it does not ""need a big deal.""The company was created when Dublin-based Actavis bought the Botox maker in March 2015, snatching it from hostile bidder Valeant Pharmaceuticals Inc (VRX.TO) and taking Allergan's name. Four months later the company agreed to sell the Actavis generics business to Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd (TEVA.TA)(TEVA.N), and in November agreed to a merger with Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) for $160 billion.Pfizer walked away from the agreement in April after the U.S. government cracked down on deals in which companies move to countries that have a lower tax rate. Saunders said that rather than make big deals, the company would continue to focus on buying back shares. Allergan said that plunging second-quarter sales of its Alzheimer's drug Namenda IR, now facing generic competition, canceled out growing revenue from Botox and its other major prescription drugs.Sales of Namenda IR plummeted to $4.1 million in the quarter from $233 million in the year-ago period. The medicine lost patent protection a year ago.Second-quarter net revenue rose marginally, to $3.68 billion from $3.63 billion a year earlier, but was below the average Wall Street estimate of $4.08 billion. Company spokesman Mark Marmur said the sales miss was largely because many analysts, in their estimates, had not taken into account that Allergan is now reporting its Anda generics distribution business as a discontinued operation.Allergan said last week it would sell Anda for $500 million to Teva, a day after the Israeli drugmaker completed the $40.5 billion acquisition of Allergan's generic-drug portfolio.Allergan cut its forecast for adjusted full-year net revenue to a range of $14.65 billion to $14.90 billion, from $17 billion. But the updated forecast also treats the Anda distribution unit as discontinued.     Allergan shares were down 3.1 percent to $245.93 in afternoon trading, alongside a 1.4 percent decline in the Arca Pharmaceutical Index .DRG of large drugmakers. Up to Friday's close of $253.85, Allergan had fallen nearly 19 percent this year.

679,"  (Repeats story filed on Tuesday, no changes)* Washington warns $14.5 billion Irish bill may hurt relations* U.S. probe first alerted EU to tax schemes by Apple and others* Senator who chaired hearings blames IRS, says EU 'fills vacuum'By Foo Yun Chee and Alastair MacdonaldBRUSSELS, Aug 30 The United States is furious at the European Union for handing Apple Inc a $14.5 billion tax demand on Tuesday but EU officials say it was Washington which put them on to the scheme in the first place.It was a U.S. Senate report in May 2013 revealing the tech giant's deal with the Irish government to rule a big slice of its global earnings untaxable that prompted the European Commission to launch its own inquiries the following month.The U.S. Treasury said the Commission's order that Apple pay 13 billion euros in back taxes to Ireland - which the company and Dublin are appealing - endangers EU-U.S. economic relations just as efforts to reach a transatlantic free trade pact unravel . A senior Democratic senator said Brussels had made ""a cheap money grab"" for U.S. revenues.But his party colleague who chaired hearings into Apple's taxes three years ago, Carl Levin, said the Europeans were only trying to take what U.S. authorities had failed to claim by not closing loopholes that allowed firms to hoard profits overseas.""The IRS has failed to stake a claim for U.S. taxes on those revenues,"" he said in a statement, referring to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. ""So Europe attempts to fill the vacuum. Shame on Apple for dodging U.S. taxes. Shame on the IRS for failing to challenge Apple's tax avoidance.""For Marcel Fratzscher, president of leading German economic think-tank DIW Berlin and author of a new book on growing inequality, the mudslinging between politicians reflects how global corporations have exploited competition for investment to blunt states' efforts to co-operate against tax avoidance. ""Companies are playing one government against another,"" he told Reuters.EU LISTENED TO SENATE EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, a straight-talking Dane who dismisses talk of leading an anti-American crusade, says the hearings at the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations chaired by Levin were what gave her Spanish  predecessor grounds to demand disclosure by Apple and Ireland. ""The Commission listened and decided to look deeper into the matter,"" Vestager said in June, crediting media reporting and hearings in the British parliament for also providing evidence to help break secrecy around nearly 1,000 cases across Europe.The Commission said in its judgment on Apple that the United States and other countries were welcome to try and claim some of the unpaid taxes for themselves - highlighting just the complaints of Levin and other senators three years ago when they skewered Apple CEO Tim Cook for failing to bring cash home.As well as Apple, Starbucks Corp was ordered to pay more Dutch taxes and Amazon.com Inc and McDonald's Corp  are still being investigated; a series of EU accusations that Google, part of Alphabet Inc, has abused its market power have also fuelled complaints from U.S. President Barack Obama's administration that Europe is out to punish American success.Competition lawyer Pierre Sabbadini said political pressures drove different responses by different authorities. Leaks and public hearings on tax deals had created pressure among voters for the EU to act in 2013, he said, while the size of the companies targeted gave them clout with political leaders, too.""When investigation-target companies have grown to the size of Apple, they can reach out for political support,"" he said.The Obama administration has taken its own action to curb tax avoidance schemes lately. In April, amid public controversy over drug company Pfizer Inc's proposed merger with Allergan Plc of Ireland, it announced plans to curb so-called ""tax inversions"", by which U.S. firms have undertaken cross-border mergers in order to switch to a domicile abroad and so avoid U.S. taxes.Pfizer abandoned the merger.

680,"   By Ransdell Pierson  The chief executive officer of Allergan Plc said his company would limit annual price increases on its prescription drugs, and that ""outlier"" drugmakers that have imposed huge price increases on their products were scaring off venture capital investors.Allergan, the maker of such products as Botox, plans to raise prices no more than once a year and keep price hikes to no more than low-to-mid-single-digit percentages, slightly above the current annual rate of inflation, CEO Brent Saunders said on Tuesday. Price increases taken by Allergan so far this year reflect that range, and will be the pattern for price increases next year and beyond, Saunders said in an interview.""Allergan is committed to being a good citizen in self-policing and being disciplined about price increases,"" Saunders said. ""And I hope others in the industry follow.""Without mentioning names, Saunders said several drugmakers that have come under fire from patients, consumer groups and politicians for huge price increases, had been ""reprehensible"" and were choking off investment in start-up companies doing cutting-edge drug research.""My biggest fear, every time there's another headline or more regulator negativity, is that venture capital needed for innovation could move out of the sector,"" Saunders said, adding the amount of venture capital backing for early stage drugmakers was slowing. ""If the bottom of the ecosystem, which is so important for early drug discovery, begins to evaporate, innovation will start to go away,"" he said. ""It has started.""Saunders outlined his price-restraint vow in a blog earlier on Tuesday.     Allergan's biggest products are Botox, used to treat wrinkles and medical conditions such as migraine headaches, and Restasis to treat dry eye. Although a significant portion of Botox sales are for uninsured cosmetic conditions that patients pay out of pocket, Saunders said Allergan would attempt to limit price increases for all uses of the brand.Allergan shares closed 1.3 percent higher at $239.12 on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday, amid a moderate advance for the Arca Pharmaceutical Index of large U.S. and European drugmakers. QUESTIONS CLINTON PROPOSALS Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has cited Turing Pharmaceuticals LLC's 5,000 percent price increase for AIDS drug Daraprim and Mylan NV’s repeated steep price increases on its EpiPen device for severe allergy sufferers as “troubling” examples of price hikes that have attracted bipartisan congressional scrutiny. Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc has also drawn criticism for hefty increases on two heart drugs and  other medicines.Clinton said on Friday that if elected president in November, she would create an oversight panel to protect U.S. consumers from large price hikes on long-available innovative drugs, a proposal that Saunders described as ""impractical."" ""I'd like to stop outliers too, but implementing that would be hard to do,"" Saunders said. ""In a free market, who says what would fall under the panel's purview, and what the price should be?""Clinton also called for emergency government imports of generics when there is insufficient market competition. Saunders said such imported drugs, lacking strict U.S. regulatory review and made under different manufacturing conditions, could have safety issues.

687,"   By Ransdell Pierson and Natalie Grover  Botox maker Allergan Plc, in its third acquisition this month, said it would pay up to $1.7 billion for Tobira Therapeutics Inc to get a leg up in the race to develop therapies for NASH, an incurable fatty liver disease closely linked to obesity.Just hours later on Tuesday, Allergan announced it would also pay $50 million upfront and make future milestone payments for Akarna Therapeutics Ltd, a privately held company that is planning early-stage studies of a treatment for NASH.There are no approved treatments for the disease affecting more than 15 million Americans, which involves accumulation of fat in the liver not caused by alcohol, and can lead to cirrhosis, liver transplants or liver cancer.""Allergan is making an excellent move into the NASH space, which is under appreciated by Wall Street and one of the major categories of untreated diseases,"" said Len Yaffe, portfolio manager of StocDoc Partners who holds shares of Tobira.Allergan's offer on Tuesday of $28.35 upfront per Tobira share is a whopping 500 percent premium to the stock's close on Monday, which had given Tobira a market capitalization of about $89 million. Tobira shareholders could receive up to $49.84 per share, contingent on the company achieving certain milestones.Tobira's stock surged 720 percent to $38.91 on Tuesday. But Allergan's fell 2.7 percent to $238.67 as some industry analysts said the deal came at a steep price. Tobira shares have been on a roller coaster ride since July 25, when they tumbled 60 percent to $4.50 after the company's lead product, cenicriviroc, failed its main goal in a mid-stage trial of showing a 2-point reduction on a scale that measures features of NASH (nonalcoholic steatohepatitis).    But cenicriviroc achieved a secondary goal by reducing by at least one stage the extent of fibrosis, a scarring of the liver that can lead to cirrhosis, without worsening of NASH. Tobira said the drug has potential to be approved if that favorable secondary finding can be duplicated in a larger late-stage study.Yaffe said cenicriviroc and related therapies being developed by the company have potential to reap annual sales of $5 billion.He said experimental NASH drugs being developed by Gilead Sciences Inc have similar sales potential and that treatments being studied by Intercept Pharmaceuticals Inc and others also have blockbuster sales potential. Allergan research chief David Nicholson, in an interview, said liver biopsies are now required to confirm NASH, but less-invasive diagnostic tests should be available by the time the first NASH treatments reach the market, or soon after.""The science in NASH is breaking now and this could become one of Allergan's largest categories"" of medicines, Nicholson said.  The proposed acquisition is the latest in a string of deals orchestrated by Brent Saunders, Allergan's chief executive, since the company's planned $160 billion merger with Pfizer Inc collapsed in April because of unfavorable new U.S. tax regulations.Allergan, best known for its Botox anti-wrinkle treatment,  last week said it would pay $639 million for Vitae Pharmaceuticals, which is developing drugs for psoriasis, eczema and autoimmune disorders. It agreed on Sept. 6 to pay $60 million for RetroSense, a privately held company developing an ophthalmology gene therapy.

689,"   By Carl O'Donnell  Allergan Plc (AGN.N) CEO Brent Saunders calls them ""stepping stones"" - small, bolt-on acquisitions, as opposed to the mega-deals common in the drug industry. And they're expected to boost dealmaking in sectors ranging from neurology to skin care.Allergan's agreement on Tuesday to acquire liver drug developer Tobira Therapeutics Inc (TBRA.O) for $1.7 billion may seem trivial compared to the proposed $160 billion deal Allergan crafted last year to sell itself to Pfizer Inc (PFE.N).But that deal was torpedoed in April by the U.S. Treasury's latest curbs on tax inversions. Now the company, domiciled in Ireland, is taking a new tack, preparing to spend a war chest of more than $20 billion on stepping-stone deals. The small deals are aimed at filling gaps in its core therapeutic areas, which range from the central nervous system and gastrointestinal diseases, to dermatology and eye care.Allergan has added four other small companies to its portfolio this year, three of which sold for less than $100 million upfront, plus performance payments. Two, ForSight Vision and Retrosense Therapeutics, treat eye disorders. The others, Topokine Therapeutics and Vitae Pharmaceuticals Inc. VTAE.O, focus on dermatology. Allergan agreed to acquire Vitae last week for $639 million.The fact that Allergan is paying top dollar for some of these companies - including a nearly 600 percent premium for Tobira, excluding performance payments - has investors and dealmakers speculating about the company's next stepping stone.Logical acquisition targets for Allergan would include Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc (ACAD.O), a maker of treatments for Parkinson’s disease; Intra-Cellular Therapies Inc (ITCI.O), a developer of psychiatric medications; Neurocrine Biosciences Inc (NBIX.O), which focuses on neurology and women’s health; and Dermira Inc (DERM.O), a dermatology company, according to investment bankers and industry investors. In an interview with Reuters, Saunders declined to comment on any specific companies that Allergan may want to acquire next. But he said that stepping stones will play a key role in helping the company continue to meet its ambitious annual revenue growth target of 10 percent for years to come. ""I needed to do big deals to get where we are, but the strategic vision was always to get to a point where we could use stepping stones,"" Saunders said. 	 Allergan has relied heavily on M&A because it views inventing its own drugs in-house as too risky. Saunders, 46, has attempted or executed mergers and acquisitions totaling more than $300 billion in the last three years. Allergan now has the money to embark on a major acquisition spree thanks to the sale of its generic drug portfolio to Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (TEVA.TA). Allergan received $33.4 billion in cash and $5.1 billion in Teva stock last month as a result of that deal. While Allergan has pledged to spend some of those dollars on share buybacks, it will still have cash reserves of more than $20 billion it can spend on deals.	Allergan wants to build out its central nervous system franchise, which is one of the largest in the industry and treats diseases including Alzheimer's, depression, migraines and schizophrenia, Saunders said.     He added that he would like to branch out into other types of neurological treatments, including multiple sclerosis, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and Parkinson's disease.     One of Allergan's successful endeavors in the central nervous system space, its Namenda Alzheimer's franchise, took a hit over the past year after one of its key drugs, Namenda IR, lost patent protection. Namenda IR generated more than $500 million in 2015.   Allergan is hoping that a ramp-up of its newly commercialized anti-psychotic drug, Vraylar, can help offset that decline.BOTOX AS A GATEWAY DRUG Saunders said he also is optimistic about opportunities in dermatology and eye care, adding that he would be open to a medium-sized deal to build out its opthalmic products.      In dermatology, Allergan has the world's biggest franchise by sales, largely due to its flagship drug, Botox, for wrinkle-smoothing.Last year, in a stepping-stone acquisition, Allergan bought a publicly traded dermatology company called Kythera for $2.1 billion, and it has been ramping up sales of its key drug, Kybella, which treats double chins.""There's definitely potential for more deals like that in dermatology,"" said Randall Stanicky, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. ""Botox is a gateway product into the entire world of aesthetics.""In the interview, Saunders left open the possibility of a transformative acquisition or merger for Allergan, which has a market capitalization of $95 billion.He said a company with a cutting-edge treatment that reversed Alzheimer's was an example of the type of big deal Allergan would consider making.    Biogen Inc BIIB.N and Eli Lilly and Co (LLY.N) both have late stage drugs that promise to reverse the effects of the degenerative neurological disease.

691,"  Sept 20 Allergan Plc said it would buy Tobira Therapeutics Inc in a deal worth up to $1.7 billion, to gain access to its experimental therapies for a fatty liver disease called NASH.Allergan's offer of $28.35 per Tobira share upfront is nearly a whopping 500 percent premium to the stock's close on Monday.

694,"  Sept 26 U.S. drugmaker Pfizer Inc said on Monday it had decided not to separate into two publicly traded companies at this time.Pfizer has for several years weighed whether a split makes sense, largely because its patent-protected medicines routinely enjoy sales growth, while its portfolio of generics usually post declines. Investors shifted their focus to whether Pfizer would split after the company terminated a $160 billion deal to acquire Irish drugmaker Allergan Plc in April due to new U.S. tax inversion rules. The company said on Monday the decision would not impact its 2016 forecast, and that it preserved the option to split in the future.

704,"   By Natalie Grover  The proposed dosing for a drug being developed by Allergan Plc to treat frequent urination at night has not been adequately studied in trials, a preliminary review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration staff concluded.The drug, SER120, is a low-dose nasal version of the commonly used treatment, desmopressin, and is designed to treat adults with nocturia, a disorder where a person wakes up to urinate twice or more at night.There are no FDA-approved drugs to specifically treat nocturia. Allergan has proposed starting patients with a 0.75 microgram (mcg) dose, and moving up to 1.5 mcg if necessary, but this dosing regimen was not studied in any clinical trials,  staff reviewers said on Monday.  (bit.ly/2dIxcrs)In addition, late-stage data showed that only the higher dose met the statistical criteria for efficacy. The ""clinical meaningfulness"" of the drug's benefit was also unclear when compared with a placebo, the reviewers said. Desmopressin was first approved in the United States in 1978 to treat patients with diabetes insipidus, a rare disorder that causes an imbalance of water in the body.  Since then, the FDA has sanctioned the drug's use in other conditions. An oral desmopressin pill from privately held Ferring Pharmaceuticals has been rejected twice by the FDA, which said the risk of hyponatremia, or abnormally low sodium levels in the blood, outweighed the drug's benefit.    The FDA had asked Allergan to enroll patients aged at least 50 to better assess the risk of hyponatremia, which is greater in the elderly, in its late-stage trials for SER120. However, since the company is seeking approval for adults regardless of age, efficacy in patients younger than 50 has not been assessed, the staff said.  Of the five deaths among patients on SER120 during clinical trials, the role of the drug cannot be definitively ruled out in two, the reviewers said. Four of the five deaths were in patients older than 75. Nocturia is a considered a symptom of one or more underlying conditions such as obstructive sleep apnea, diabetes mellitus and congestive heart failure.  The review comes two days ahead of a meeting of outside experts who will recommend to the FDA whether to approve the drug. The agency is not obliged to follow its advisory panel's recommendations but typically does so. Allergan in 2010 acquired from privately held Serenity Pharmaceuticals exclusive rights to develop, manufacture and sell the drug for all potential indications, excluding bedwetting in children.The company's shares were down 1.3 percent at $224.42 in morning trading.

718,"   By Ransdell Pierson and Natalie Grover  Allergan Plc's chief executive officer on Wednesday took the blame for disappointing quarterly earnings as the drugmaker underestimated sales declines for its older medicines, forcing it to cut its 2016 profit forecast.Allergan (AGN.N) shares fell 4 percent in late-morning trading amid slight gains for the drug sector. CEO Brent Saunders, who has snapped up a number of smaller drugmakers since Allergan's planned $160 billion merger with Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) collapsed in April, said the company overlooked sales trends for some of its older products, including Asacol for ulcerative colitis and Alzheimer's dementia treatment Namenda.""The miss wasn't in our promoted products,"" Saunders said, but instead ""in some products we don't pay much attention to. It's not an excuse; hopefully it won't happen again ... I accept full accountability for the situation.""  But the company was able to cheer investors, saying it expanded its share buyback program by $5 billion to $15 billion and initiated a first-ever quarterly dividend of 70 cents per share, beginning in the first quarter of 2017.In May, Allergan said it would buy back up to $10 billion in stock, and on Wednesday said it had repurchased $5 billion in shares ahead of schedule.  The Dublin-based company earned $3.32 per share, excluding special items, in the third quarter, widely missing the average analyst estimate of $3.56, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.   The profit miss was driven by weaker-than-expected sales, slightly lower gross margins and higher expenses, Evercore ISI's Umer Raffat wrote in a note.   Net revenue rose 4.4 percent to $3.62 billion but was less than the average analyst estimate of $3.68 billion.   The company was created when Dublin-based Actavis, under Saunders' leadership, bought the Botox maker in March 2015, snatching it from hostile bidder Valeant Pharmaceuticals Inc (VRX.TO), and taking the Allergan name. Saunders has been one of the industry's most active dealmakers. Allergan has sold its Actavis generics business for $40.5 billion and its Anda drug distribution business for $500 million to Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd (TEVA.TA)(TEVA.N).   The net loss from continuing operations, net of tax, narrowed to $380.1 million, or $1.15 per share, from $875 million, or $2.40, a year earlier.      The company cut its adjusted full-year net revenue forecast for continuing operations to $14.45 billion-$14.65 billion from $14.65 billion-$14.90 billion.  Allergan also reduced its full-year adjusted profit to a range of $13.30-$13.50 per share from a previous range of $13.75- $14.20.Shares dropped $8.26, or 4 percent, to $200.43.

But the company was able to cheer investors, saying it expanded its share buyback program by $5 billion to $15 billion and initiated a first-ever quarterly dividend of 70 cents per share, beginning in the first quarter of 2017.In May, Allergan said it would buy back up to $10 billion in stock, and on Wednesday said it had repurchased $5 billion in shares ahead of schedule.  The Dublin-based company earned $3.32 per share, excluding special items, in the third quarter, widely missing the average analyst estimate of $3.56, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.   The profit miss was driven by weaker-than-expected sales, slightly lower gross margins and higher expenses, Evercore ISI's Umer Raffat wrote in a note.   Net revenue rose 4.4 percent to $3.62 billion but was less than the average analyst estimate of $3.68 billion.   The company was created when Dublin-based Actavis, under Saunders' leadership, bought the Botox maker in March 2015, snatching it from hostile bidder Valeant Pharmaceuticals Inc (VRX.TO), and taking the Allergan name. Saunders has been one of the industry's most active dealmakers. Allergan has sold its Actavis generics business for $40.5 billion and its Anda drug distribution business for $500 million to Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd (TEVA.TA)(TEVA.N).   The net loss from continuing operations, net of tax, narrowed to $380.1 million, or $1.15 per share, from $875 million, or $2.40, a year earlier.      The company cut its adjusted full-year net revenue forecast for continuing operations to $14.45 billion-$14.65 billion from $14.65 billion-$14.90 billion.  Allergan also reduced its full-year adjusted profit to a range of $13.30-$13.50 per share from a previous range of $13.75- $14.20.Shares dropped $8.26, or 4 percent, to $200.43. Up to Tuesday's close, Allergan's stock had fallen 33 percent this year.(The story was refiled to fix a typo in the eighth paragraph) (Reporting by Natalie Grover in Bengaluru and Ransdell Pierson in New York; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila and Jeffrey Benkoe)",2016-11-02,AGN,"Wed Nov 2, 2016 | 12:07pm EDT",REFILE-UPDATE 4-Allergan CEO takes blame for big miss on quarterly earnings,http://www.reuters.com//article/allergan-results-idUSL4N1D33N6?type=companyNews

728,"   By Svea Herbst-Bayliss | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Healthcare stocks, including insurers, have jumped since Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election last week and some hedge fund managers may see further gains in after making new bets in the sector in the third quarter.Billionaire investor Daniel Loeb's Third Point portfolio  invested in insurer Humana Inc during the third quarter, according to the latest 13F hedge fund filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Loeb's hedge fund bought 1.4 million shares of Humana.John Paulson's Paulson & Co., whose investments have been followed closely ever since his successful bet against the housing market, also took a new position in Humana, buying 79,500 shares. Pointstate Capital put on a new position as well, buying 991,622 shares. At Glenview Capital Management, where Humana was already the biggest investment, the firm raised its holdings by 9.0 percent.  Diamond Hill Capital, Samlyn Capital, P. Schoenfeld Asset Management and Clovis Capital Management also made new bets on the insurer, although they were far smaller, according to regulatory filings that show what U.S. stocks investment managers owned on Sept. 30.Over the last six weeks, Humana has been one of the sector's best performers, boasting a 12.16 percent gain since Sept. 30. Since January, the stock has gained 11 percent, handily outperforming the S&P 500's 6 percent gain.Some insurers including UnitedHealth Group Inc and Anthem Inc had said they are losing money on the healthcare exchanges created by President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act. With Donald Trump vowing to overturn the law, UnitedHealth and Anthem have also posted strong gains since the end of the third quarter. Anthem has climbed 10.5 percent in the last six weeks with UnitedHealth gaining 9 percent and Aetna Inc posting a 7.5 percent rise.Glenview Capital boosted its Anthem bet by 41 percent while Hotchkis & Wiley Capital Management and Cornerstone Advisors Inc also each raised their stakes. Vulcan Value Partners and Two Sigma Investments increased their bets on UnitedHealth.Most investment managers released their 13-F filings on Monday and while the information is backward looking, it is watched closely by investors for hints of upcoming trends. The filings also reveal which managers made moves, identifying by name the investors who may have been behind big gyrations. Not all investors stuck with the health insurers, however, with a good number trimming their investments in the run-up to the U.S. election on November 8. With most polls calling for Hillary Clinton to win the White House, some investors were concerned she could impose greater regulation on drug companies and curb their price hikes.Hedge fund Adage trimmed its bet on Humana but held onto 1.1 million shares. Arrowgrass Capital Partners cut its bet by nearly half but still owned 1.9 million shares. And Farallon Capital Management, founded by Tom Steyer, cut its position by 45 percent to 382,000 shares.Similarly, shares of Valeant Pharmaceuticals, which drew Clinton's ire during the campaign for enormous price hikes, continue to drop in the last weeks amid fears about its debt load.

730,"   By Svea Herbst-Bayliss | NEW YORK  NEW YORK U.S. stocks are poised to climb more in 2017 as the policies of Republican President-elect Donald Trump are likely to boost earnings, Steven Einhorn, vice chairman of Hedge fund Omega Advisors, said on Monday. ""The outlook for the equity market for next year should be as good or a bit better than this year,"" Einhorn said at the Reuters Global Investment Outlook Summit in New York. He cited Trump's positions on repatriation of earnings and lower taxes as brightening his market view. ""I would reiterate and repeat a total return of 6 percent to 8 percent growth"" including dividend yields of 2 percent, Einhorn said.The biggest danger to his outlook, he said, is that gains would be even stronger. ""The odds favor exceeding it rather than missing it.""Einhorn said many of Trump's plans, including cutting the corporate tax rate and allowing companies to bring earnings home more easily, would help them deliver higher profits in the years ahead, keeping stocks on their bull market path. While the effective tax rate may not fall to Trump's proposed 15 percent from 27 percent today, it may come in around 20 percent, Einhorn said. The cash that companies bring back to the United States could help fuel more stock buybacks, which also would boost the market.Einhorn made a similarly optimistic call one year ago when he also expected the market to gain between 6 percent and 8 percent. The Standard & Poor's 500 index has risen 5.7 percent since January, even after a sharp drop early in the year, when fears of slower growth in the United States and in China weighed on sentiment. Omega Advisors, a hedge fund founded in 1990, oversees roughly $4 billion in assets and has long been considered one of the industry's best stock pickers. This year it has gained roughly 4 percent. Even though Einhorn expects the U.S. Federal Reserve to keep raising interest rates beginning in December, he said the benefits of Trump's expected policies were likely to outweigh any effects that a tighter monetary policy might have on companies. ""There have been molehills that the markets made into mountains,"" he said, adding that the factors that typically herald the end of a bull market are still nowhere in sight.Healthcare companies especially stand to benefit from new policies, Einhorn said, noting that many of those stocks have suffered from fears that Democrat Hillary Clinton could win the White House and impose stricter regulations.Einhorn said many healthcare stocks now have attractive valuations and ""significant repatriation potential."" Omega made bigger bets on pharmaceutical company Shire Plc in the third quarter, raising its investment by nearly 75 percent, a regulatory filing shows. The filing also said Omega trimmed its holdings of Allergan Plc (AGN.N) by 19 percent. With a positive outlook for the stock market, Einhorn said many active money managers could now better show their mettle. He said he expected some reversal in the tide of money that has been flowing into passively managed funds that largely mirror their indexes' moves.Follow Reuters Summits on Twitter @Reuters_Summits(For more summit stories, see here) (Reporting by Svea Herbst-Bayliss; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)",2016-11-14,AGN,"Tue Nov 15, 2016 | 4:38am EST",REUTERS SUMMIT-Omega's Einhorn sees Trump's policies boosting stocks,http://www.reuters.com//article/investment-summit-einhorn-trump-idUSL1N1DF10L?type=companyNews

In August, it had  estimated adjusted EPS of $5.20-$5.40 and revenue of $22-$22.5 billion.""What has brought numbers lower are revenues from new launches,"" Siggi Olafsson, CEO of Teva's global generic medicines, told an analysts' conference call, noting the company had expected 3-4 more launches.""They will come later in 2017 or 2018, they are not lost at all. This moves the growth curve.""Teva (TEVA.N) shares were down 5 percent at $39 in early trade in New York.Teva Chief Executive Erez Vigodman said the company had spent a significant amount in the past year to acquire assets. ""Now it is time for Teva to step away for the foreseeable future from executing material ... deals and focus all of its energy on organic growth and extracting all of the deal-related synergies,"" Vigodman said.He said the company was re-evaluating priorities in 2017.""If there are projects that won't generate value I will terminate those projects,"" he said.Wells Fargo analyst David Maris said: ""We like this as we think companies benefit from pausing for a period after major deals to help consolidate the businesses."" Maris rates Teva ""outperform"". Teva earned $1.31 per share, excluding one-time items, in the third quarter, down from $1.35 a year earlier due to share offerings in December to finance the Allergan deal and shares issued to Allergan in August. Adjusted net income rose to $1.4 billion from $1.2 billion.    Revenue rose 15 percent to $5.6 billion, primarily due to the inclusion of $887 million from Allergan. Excluding foreign exchange fluctuations, revenue increased 19 percent.  Teva was forecast to earn $1.28 excluding one-off items on revenue of $5.7 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Mizuho analyst Irina Koffler attributed the revenue miss to its speciality drugs business, which had revenue of $2.05 billion versus $2.06 billion forecast by analysts.    Global sales of its best-selling multiple sclerosis drugCopaxone slipped 2 percent to $1.1 billion. The drug is now facing competition after Sandoz, part of Swiss drugmaker Novartis AG NOVM.VX, and Momenta Pharmaceuticals (MNTA.O) last year launched a once daily 20 mg version called Glatopa.Teva said it would disclose its 2017 operating plan and forecast with fourth-quarter results in February.Teva also made a $520 million provision to settle previously disclosed investigations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act by the U.S. Justice Department and Securities and Exchange Commission.
