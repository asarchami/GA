0,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, April 24 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the credit ratings of  Federal Realty Investment Trust (NYSE: FRT) (Federal) as follows: --Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A-'; --Unsecured revolving credit facility at 'A-'; --Senior unsecured term loan at 'A-'; --Senior unsecured notes at 'A-'; --Redeemable preferred shares at 'BBB'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. KEY RATING DRIVERS The consistent and steady cash flow growth provided by Federal's community  shopping centers underpin Fitch's ratings and Outlook, together with the  company's track record of prudent balance sheet management and creative  redevelopment and mixed-use development.  The potential for near-term weakness in Federal's Washington, D.C. portfolio  (34% of annualized base rent ) due to softer regional economic growth and  some remaining execution risk related to its mixed-use developments under  construction balance these credit positives. Buy-And-Hold Strategy Fitch views positively Federal's buy-and-hold strategy that targets premier  retail properties in supply-constrained markets with above average demographics.  This strategy, augmented by the company's redevelopment activities, has enabled  Federal to produce consistently strong operating performance that has  historically been stronger and more stable - through the cycle - than the retail  real estate market generally and its public shopping center REIT peers  specifically.  Consistent and Superior Growth Federal's property management expertise of its 87 properties comprising 19.5  million square feet (excluding joint ventures) as of Dec. 31, 2013 is evidenced  by consistently positive same store net operating income (SSNOI) growth,  excluding redevelopments, through multiple cycles. Within the last 10 years, the  lone exception was 2009 when SSNOI declined -0.3%.  This compares favorably to its public shopping center peers who declined an  average of -4% in 2009. When including NOI from redevelopment properties, FRT's  SSNOI growth has not dipped below 1.6% in any year over the last decade,  resulting in year-over-year recurring operating EBITDA growth significantly  stronger than its peers.  Federal's consistently strong rent growth on expiring leases largely reflects  the high quality infill locations of its properties. Federal's releasing spreads  have been higher than peers during this economic and commercial real estate  recovery. Moreover, the company was unique among its retail REIT peers in its  ability to maintain positive leasing spreads throughout the recent economic  downturn. Conservative Leverage Federal's leverage and coverage metrics are strong and appropriate for the  rating. FRT has historically managed leverage at conservative levels with net  debt to recurring operating EBITDA levels ranging between the mid-4.0 times (x)  and mid-5.0x during the last 10 years. Fitch expects Federal's leverage to  sustain in the high-to-mid 5.0x range, trending towards the lower end by 2016 as  the company's larger developments come on-line and begin to contribute to  portfolio cash flows during the next two to three years. Leverage was 5.4x as of  Dec. 31, 2013 compared to 5.5x as of Dec. 31, 2012 and 5.7x at Dec. 31, 2011. Strong Fixed-Charge Coverage Federal's fixed-charge coverage was 3.0x for the year ended Dec. 31, 2013  compared to 2.7x in 2012 and 2.9x in 2011. Fitch expects fixed-charge coverage  to improve to the high 3.0x range in 2016, which is strong for the rating. Fitch  calculates fixed-charge coverage as recurring operating EBITDA less tenant  improvements and incentives, recurring maintenance capital expenditures and  straight-line rent adjustments divided by interest incurred and preferred  dividends. Good Contingent Liquidity Federal's sizeable unencumbered asset pool provides additional protection to  unsecured debt holders. As of Dec. 31, 2013, 73 of the company's 87 properties  were unencumbered. Fitch calculates the company's unencumbered asset value  coverage of unsecured debt (UA/UD) was 3.0x at Dec. 31, 2013, based on applying  a stressed 7% capitalization rate to the fourth quarter 2013 (4Q'13)  unencumbered NOI.  Fitch's ratings for Federal contemplate the high quality of its unencumbered  asset pool which includes the company's three largest (by ABR) and most valuable  properties, Santana Row (San Jose, CA), Bethesda Row (Bethesda, MD) and Third  Street Promenade (Los Angeles, CA) which together comprised approximately 15% of  ABR. Granular Tenant Base High tenant credit quality and granularity within Federal's portfolio help  mitigate tenant bankruptcy risk. Only one tenant represents more than 3% of ABR,  and the top 25 tenants represent a relatively low 30% of total ABR as of Dec.  31, 2013.  The company maintains well laddered lease expirations by year with average  annual lease expirations of 8.8% of total square footage and a maximum of 14% of  square feet expiring in a single year (excluding tenant lease extension  options). Strong Access to Capital Further, the company has maintained good access to the capital markets and has a  reasonably well laddered the debt maturity schedule, notwithstanding moderate  increases in the company's 2017 debt maturities to 16.3% of total debt, which  Fitch views as manageable. Solid Liquidity Coverage Fitch's base case analysis shows liquidity coverage of 2.7x through the end of  2015 and 1.4x including unfunded development commitments. The company's  liquidity coverage ratio (including development) would improve to 2.0x assuming  it refinanced 80% of its secured debt maturing in 2014 and 2015. However, Fitch  recognizes Federal's preference for owning assets on an unencumbered basis,  reducing the likelihood of that scenario.  Fitch defines liquidity coverage as sources of liquidity (unrestricted cash,  availability under the company's unsecured revolving credit facility pro forma  for the recent commitment size increase, projected retained cash flows from  operating activities after dividends and distributions) divided by uses of  liquidity (pro rata debt maturities and projected recurring capital  expenditures) for Jan. 1, 2014 to Dec. 31, 2015. Federal's demonstrated access to multiple forms of capital further supports its  liquidity profile and offsets refinancing risk. In addition, Federal's retained  operating cash flow after dividend payments provides over $100 million of  internally generated capital annually that can be used to make accretive  investments and/or satisfy its financing obligations. Fitch calculates that the  company's dividends represented 84.5% adjusted funds from operations during  2013. Geographic Concentration The portfolio's moderate asset and market concentrations and continued  industry-wide weakness among select retailer tenants - primarily local  small-shop tenants - are moderate credit concerns. Federal's three largest  properties comprise roughly 15% of total ABR. Also, Federal generates  approximately 34% of its ABR from the D.C. Metro market where commercial real  estate market conditions are weakening due to cutbacks in U.S. government  spending. Preferred Stock Notching The two-notch differential between FRT's IDR and preferred stock rating is  consistent with Fitch's criteria for corporate entities with an IDR of 'A-'.  Based on Fitch research titled 'Treatment and Notching of Hybrids in  Nonfinancial Corporate and REIT Credit Analysis', available on Fitch's web site  at 'www.fitchratings.com', these preferred securities are deeply subordinated  and have loss absorption elements that would likely result in poor recoveries in  the event of a corporate default. Stable Outlook The Stable Outlook centers on Fitch's expectation that FRT's credit profile will  remain appropriate for the 'A-' rating through the economic cycles, barring any  significant changes in the company's capital structure. The Stable Outlook  reflects the quality of management and consistency of cash flows resulting in  stable credit metrics, in line with an 'A-' rating. Further, FRT continues to  access various sources of capital and maintains a solid unencumbered asset base  and liquidity profile. RATING SENSITIVITIES While Fitch does not expect near-term positive momentum on the rating, the  following factors may have a positive impact on FRT's ratings and/or Outlook: --Fitch's expectation of net debt to recurring operating EBITDA sustaining below  4.5x (leverage was 5.4x as of Dec. 31, 2013); --Fitch's expectation of fixed charge coverage sustaining above 3.5x (coverage  was 3.0x for the 12 months ending Dec. 31, 2013). --Greater asset diversification of the portfolio via growth (FRT's three largest  assets generate roughly 15% of total ABR). The following factors may result in negative momentum on the rating and/or  Outlook: --Shift in management strategy away from owning and redeveloping retail assets  in infill locations; --Unencumbered asset coverage of unsecured debt below 2.5x (coverage was 3.0x as  of Dec. 31, 2013 utilizing a stressed 7% capitalization rate); --Fitch's expectation of leverage above 5.5x; --Fitch's expectation of fixed charge coverage sustaining below 2.5x.

3,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, July 07 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A-' rating to the  senior unsecured notes due 2046 issued by Federal Realty Investment Trust (NYSE:  FRT; Federal). The Rating Outlook is Stable. A full list of ratings follows at  the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS The ratings are based on Federal's consistent and steady cash flow growth  provided by the company's community shopping centers, along with a track record  of prudent balance sheet management and creative redevelopment and mixed-use  development.  The potential for near-term weakness in Federal's Washington, D.C. portfolio  (approximately 32% of annualized base rent ) due to softer regional  economic growth and some remaining execution risk related to Federal's mixed-use  developments under construction balance these credit positives. Buy-And-Hold Strategy Fitch views positively Federal's buy-and-hold strategy that targets premier  retail properties in supply-constrained markets with above-average demographics.  This strategy, augmented by the company's redevelopment activities, has enabled  Federal to produce consistently robust operating performance that has  historically been stronger and more stable - through the cycle - than the retail  real estate market generally and its public shopping center REIT peers  specifically. Consistent and Superior Growth Federal's expertise in managing its 96 properties, which comprised 22 million  square feet as of March 31, 2016, is evidenced by consistently positive  same-store net operating income (SSNOI) growth, excluding redevelopment, through  multiple cycles. Within the last 10 years, the lone exception was 2009 when  SSNOI declined 0.3%. This compares favorably to its public shopping center peers  which declined an average of 4.1% in 2009.  Federal's consistently strong rent growth on expiring leases largely reflects  the high-quality infill locations of its properties. Federal's releasing spreads  have been higher than peers during this economic and commercial real estate  recovery. Moreover, the company was unique among shopping center REITs in its  ability to maintain positive leasing spreads throughout the recent economic  downturn. Conservative Leverage Fitch expects Federal's leverage to sustain in the high- to mid-5x range,  trending towards the lower end by 2017 as the company's larger developments come  on-line and begin to contribute to portfolio cash flows during the next two to  three years. Leverage was 5.3x for the trailing 12 months (TTM) ended March 31,  2016, compared to 5.4x and 5.2x at year-end 2015 and 2014, respectively. Federal  has historically managed leverage at conservative levels with net  debt-to-recurring operating EBITDA levels ranging between the mid-4x and mid-5x  range.  Strong Fixed Charge Coverage Fitch expects SSNOI growth, the stabilization of its phase 1 mixed-use  developments, and interest savings from recent debt refinancings to result in  fixed charge coverage (FCC) sustaining in the low-4x range through 2017, which  is strong for the rating. Federal's FCC was 4x for the TTM ended March 31, 2016,  compared to 3.9x in 2015 and 3.5x in 2014. Fitch calculates FCC as recurring  operating EBITDA less tenant improvements and incentives, recurring maintenance  capital expenditures and straight-line rent adjustments divided by interest  incurred and preferred dividends. Strong Contingent Liquidity Federal's sizeable unencumbered asset pool provides additional protection to  unsecured debt holders. As of March 31, 2016, 88.2 % of the company's property  NOI was unencumbered. Fitch calculates the company's unencumbered asset value  coverage of unsecured debt (UA/UD) was 3.1x at March 31, 2016 based on applying  a stressed 7% capitalization rate to the first quarter 2016 unencumbered NOI. Fitch's ratings for Federal incorporate the high quality of Federal's  unencumbered asset pool which includes the company's three largest (by ABR) and  most valuable properties, Santana Row (San Jose, CA), Bethesda Row (Bethesda,  MD) and Third Street Promenade (Los Angeles, CA), which together account for  approximately 13% of ABR. Granular Tenant Base High tenant credit quality and granularity within Federal's portfolio help  mitigate tenant bankruptcy risk. Only one tenant (grocer Ahold USA, Inc./not  rated) represents more than 3% of ABR, and the top 25 tenants represent a  relatively low 29.5% of total ABR at March 31, 2016.  The company maintains well-laddered lease expirations by year with average  annual lease expirations of 8.9% of ABR through 2025 and a maximum of 12.5% of  ABR expiring in a single year (excluding tenant lease extension options).  Adequate Liquidity Coverage Fitch's base case analysis shows liquidity coverage of 2.8x through the end of  2017 (1.2x including estimated development expenditures). The company's pro  forma liquidity coverage ratio (including development) would improve to 1.7x  assuming it refinanced 80% of its secured debt maturing through 2017. However,  Fitch recognizes Federal's preference for owning assets on an unencumbered  basis, reducing the likelihood of that scenario.  Fitch defines liquidity coverage as sources of liquidity (unrestricted cash,  availability under the company's unsecured revolving credit facility pro forma  for the upsizing of the facility on April 20, 2016, projected retained cash  flows from operating activities after dividends and distributions) divided by  uses of liquidity (pro rata debt maturities and projected recurring capital  expenditures) for April 1, 2016 to Dec. 31, 2017. Federal's demonstrated access to multiple forms of capital further supports its  liquidity profile and offsets refinancing risk. In addition, Federal's retained  operating cash flow after dividend payments provides over $70 million of  internally generated capital annually that can be used to make accretive  investments, fund development and/or satisfy its financing obligations. Fitch  calculates that the company's dividends represented 77% of adjusted funds from  operations during the three months ending March 31, 2016. Geographic Concentration The portfolio's moderate asset and market concentrations and continued  industry-wide weakness among select retailer tenants - primarily local  small-shop tenants - are moderate credit concerns. Federal's three largest  properties comprise roughly 13% of total ABR. Also, Federal generates  approximately 32% of its ABR from the D.C. Metro market where commercial real  estate market conditions weakened due to cutbacks in U.S. government spending,  but more recently have apparently stabilized. Stable Outlook The Stable Outlook centers on Fitch's expectation that Federal's credit profile  will remain appropriate for the 'A-' rating through economic cycles, barring any  significant changes in the company's capital structure. The Stable Outlook  reflects the quality of management and consistency of cash flows resulting in  stable credit metrics, in line with an 'A-' rating. Further, Federal continues  to access various sources of capital and maintains a solid unencumbered asset  base and liquidity profile. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case include: --Low- to mid-single digit GAAP SSNOI growth (including redevelopments) through  2017, primarily due to positive leasing spreads and, to a lesser extent,  occupancy gains; --Minimal acquisition activity and no incremental dispositions through 2017; --Secured debt maturing through 2017 will be paid off at expiration date. RATING SENSITIVITIES While Fitch does not expect a near-term positive change in the rating, the  following factors may have a positive impact on Federal's ratings and/or  Outlook: --Fitch's expectation of net debt-to-recurring operating EBITDA sustaining below  4.5x (leverage was 5.3x at March 31, 2016); --Fitch's expectation of FCC sustaining above 3.5x (FCC was 4.0x for the TTM  ended March 31, 2016); --Greater asset diversification of the portfolio via growth (Federal's three  largest assets generate roughly 13% of total ABR). The following factors may result in negative momentum for the rating and/or  Outlook: --Shift in management strategy away from owning and redeveloping retail assets  in infill locations; --Unencumbered asset coverage of unsecured debt below 2.5x (coverage was 3.1x at  March 31, 2016 using a stressed 7% capitalization rate); --Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining above 5.5x; --Fitch's expectation of FCC sustaining below 2.5x. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch currently rates Federal as follows: --Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'A-'; --Unsecured revolving credit facility 'A-'; --Senior unsecured term loan 'A-'; --Senior unsecured notes 'A-'; --Redeemable preferred shares 'BBB'.

Further, Federal continues  to access various sources of capital and maintains a solid unencumbered asset  base and liquidity profile. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case include: --Low- to mid-single digit GAAP SSNOI growth (including redevelopments) through  2017, primarily due to positive leasing spreads and, to a lesser extent,  occupancy gains; --Minimal acquisition activity and no incremental dispositions through 2017; --Secured debt maturing through 2017 will be paid off at expiration date. RATING SENSITIVITIES While Fitch does not expect a near-term positive change in the rating, the  following factors may have a positive impact on Federal's ratings and/or  Outlook: --Fitch's expectation of net debt-to-recurring operating EBITDA sustaining below  4.5x (leverage was 5.3x at March 31, 2016); --Fitch's expectation of FCC sustaining above 3.5x (FCC was 4.0x for the TTM  ended March 31, 2016); --Greater asset diversification of the portfolio via growth (Federal's three  largest assets generate roughly 13% of total ABR). The following factors may result in negative momentum for the rating and/or  Outlook: --Shift in management strategy away from owning and redeveloping retail assets  in infill locations; --Unencumbered asset coverage of unsecured debt below 2.5x (coverage was 3.1x at  March 31, 2016 using a stressed 7% capitalization rate); --Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining above 5.5x; --Fitch's expectation of FCC sustaining below 2.5x. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch currently rates Federal as follows: --Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'A-'; --Unsecured revolving credit facility 'A-'; --Senior unsecured term loan 'A-'; --Senior unsecured notes 'A-'; --Redeemable preferred shares 'BBB'.

Reproduction or retransmission in whole or  in part is prohibited except by permission. All rights reserved. In issuing and  maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast  information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and  underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch  conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it  in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification  of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are  available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's  factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains  will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the  requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is  offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of  relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its  advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as  audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports,  engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties,  the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources  with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the  issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports  should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any  third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on  in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete.  Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the  information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and  other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the  work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial  statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings  and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking  and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature  cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current  facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that  were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.  The information in this report is provided ""as is"" without any representation or  warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or  any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the  report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security.  This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and  methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore,  ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual,  or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or   a report. The  rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk,  unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or  sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals  identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible  for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes  only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute  for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer  and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be  changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch.  Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a  recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the  adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular  investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to  any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other  obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from  US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In  certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular  issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a  single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000  (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or  dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to  use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed  under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act  of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular  jurisdiction. Due to the relative efficiency of electronic publishing and  distribution, Fitch research may be available to electronic subscribers up to  three days earlier than to print subscribers.
