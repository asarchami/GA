0,"   By John Wasik | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Jan 13 If the stock market rally continues, last year's laggards may be this year's winners.Many of the sectors that could do well are late bloomers in the five-year bull run. They may not seem like obvious choices, yet are worthwhile if you're contrarian or slightly defensive.Assuming economic fundamentals and corporate earnings remain solid, it could be a decent year for stocks overall and even better for companies that were neglected in 2013.""I'm optimistic,"" said Diane Swonk, chief economist for Mesirow Financial in Chicago, who predicts three-percent GDP growth and the creation of up to three million jobs this year.""I haven't felt bullish in a long time,"" Swonk said at the annual economic outlook luncheon of the Executive Club of Chicago on Jan. 9.REAL ESTATE REBOUND A surge in institutional buying came in 2012 among homebuilding stocks. But last year, Wall Street moved on and real estate underperformed every sector in the S&P 500 except for basic materials, rising just 6 percent for the year through Jan. 10, according to Morningstar.This year could be different if the economy continues to create more jobs and spur long-term demand for all kinds of real estate, from single-family homes to commercial storage units. The most recent Case-Shiller Home Price index report showed U.S. home prices posting their strongest annualized gain in seven years. There's still much pent-up demand for homes and commercial properties. With mortgage rates expected to remain relatively low, the real estate sector still has some promise.Exchange-traded funds that invest in real estate investment trusts are a worthy consideration, especially if you are looking for extra yield.Consider the iShares U.S. Real Estate ETF, which holds developers and property managers like Simon Property Group Inc, American Tower Corp and Public Storage . The fund was up only 1 percent last year, but yields nearly 4 percent. It charges 0.46 percent for annual expenses.MATERIALS MAKE SENSE  The materials sector was the most unloved group among the Standard & Poor's industry sectors last year, gaining less than 3 percent for the year through Jan. 10.  A highly-cyclical basket of metals, chemical, mining and paper stocks, this cadre tends to do best during mature economic cycles.But laggards can become leaders if U.S. economic growth - pegged at more than four percent in the 3rd quarter - continues.The Materials Select Sector SPDR owns stocks like Monsanto, Dow Chemical Co and Freeport McMoRan Copper and Gold. The SPDR charges 0.18 percent for annual management expenses and outperformed the materials sector as a whole, gaining 26 percent last year.ENERGY SURGE  Energy was another lackluster sector last year, returning a modest 10 percent for the year ending Jan. 10, compared to the best-performing technology group, which gained 56 percent. Improving demand for energy globally bodes well for companies that produce oil and natural gas, though.The Vanguard Energy ETF owns leading producers and service companies such as ExxonMobil Corp, Chevron Corp  and Schlumberger NV. The fund charges 0.14 percent for annual expenses and returned 26 percent last year.UTILITIES STILL DEFENSIVE Companies that produce or distribute power, natural gas and water seldom light up any investor's radar screen during bull rallies. These high-dividend companies only become alluring when investors retreat from the most popular sector of the moment or there's widespread uncertainty.Since the bull rally will fizzle at some point, it's always good to have a fallback. Utilities fit that bill. Although these companies were firmly in the bottom tier last year, they could rebound if the market runs into trouble.Consider an ETF such as the iShares U.S. Utilities, which holds blue chips such as Duke Energy Corp, Dominion Resources and Exelon Corp. The fund returned almost 15 percent last year and yields about 3 percent with a 0.46 percent annual expense ratio.Feeling skittish about picking a lackluster U.S. sector and hoping it rebounds? A wiser choice would be to spread your portfolio among every sector through a broad-based world stock fund such as the iShares MSCI ACWI Index ETF, which holds the biggest stocks from around the world such as Apple , Nestle SA and General Electric Co. The fund rose 22 percent last year and charges 0.34 percent for annual expenses.",2014-01-13,DUK,"Mon Jan 13, 2014 | 2:52pm EST",COLUMN-Will last year's stock market laggards be 2014's winners?,http://www.reuters.com//article/column-wasik-laggards-idUSL2N0KN1K720140113?type=companyNews
1,"  HOUSTON Jan 27 SCANA Corp's utility unit on Monday agreed to increase its ownership stake in two new nuclear units under construction in South Carolina, purchasing a 5 percent state from its public power partner for $500 million.Directors of South Carolina's state-owned electric utility, Santee Cooper, voted Monday to sell 5 percent of its stake in the two new 1,100-megawatt reactors under construction at the VC Summer plant, reducing its share to 40 percent.SCANA's South Carolina Electric and Gas Co will own 60 percent of Summer units 2 and 3, which are among the first advanced-design nuclear reactors to be built in the United States in more than 30 years.The once-predicted revival of U.S. nuclear construction has been tempered by lower natural gas prices, anemic growth in electricity demand and the lack of restrictions on emissions of carbon dioxide.The only other new U.S. reactors are being built by Southern Co's Georgia Power unit, along with partners, at the Vogtle nuclear plant in Georgia.Since 2011, Santee Cooper has negotiated with a number of utilities from Florida to Ohio in an effort to reduce its stake in the Summer nuclear units, saying the recession had slowed the state's electric growth projections.Santee Cooper's talks failed to produce an agreement. Only Duke Energy still expressed interest in investing in the new Summer reactors. On Monday, however, Duke said in a brief filing that it was ""no longer engaged"" in discussions with Santee Cooper regarding the potential acquisition of a 5- to 10-percent ownership interest in the Summer reactors.Last year, Duke dropped a plan to build two new nuclear reactors in North Carolina, citing slow growth in power demand.Santee Cooper officials previously they wanted to reduce the utility's stake in the new reactors to about 20 percent. ""The past few years have shown unprecedented volatility in base load fuel costs and increasing regulatory pressures on fossil-fueled generation,"" said Lonnie Carter, Santee Cooper's chief executive, in a statement.""Today's action reduces our costs to customers somewhat, while still preserving an ownership level that will position us well for the flexibility we will need going forward,"" Carter said.SCANA said the additional 110 megawatts it will gain from the deal will replace a portion of the coal-fired generation it expects to retire over the next five years. The increase in ownership of the new nuclear project ""will delay the need to build new gas-fired capacity after 2020,"" said Kevin Marsh, SCANA chairman.SCANA said the 5-percent ownership interest will be acquired in three stages, with 1 percent to be acquired in late 2017 or early 2018 when the first new Summer reactor is scheduled to begin commercial operation. An additional 2 percent would be acquired before the first anniversary of commercial operation and the final 2 percent would be acquired before the second anniversary date.The agreement also provides that Santee Cooper will not transfer any of its remaining ownership interest in the two new units until both units are completed, the companies said.The transaction is subject to regulatory approval.Previously, Santee Cooper said it negotiated with the Florida Municipal Power Agency, the Orlando Utilities Commission of Florida, American Municipal Power of Columbus, Ohio, and the South Mississippi Electric Power Association.",2014-01-28,DUK,"Mon Jan 27, 2014 | 8:04pm EST",SCANA raises stake in new Summer nuclear units; Duke bows out,http://www.reuters.com//article/utilities-nuclear-scana-idUSL2N0L201E20140128?type=companyNews
2,"   By Chris Prentice | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Jan 30 The arctic cold sweeping across the United States has caused rare winter power interruptions for U.S. spinning mills in North and South Carolina, including Frontier Spinning Mills, the second-largest yarn producer in the United StatesFrontier, located in Sanford, North Carolina, the heart of the country's textile industry, has had to stop operating following requests from their power supplier, Duke Energy Corp., John Bakane, chief executive officer, told Reuters on Thursday.U.S. cotton traders, ginners, and buyers were already dealing with tight supplies and the late processing of a small crop in the world's top exporter.""You've seen mills have to shut down so power companies can heat houses,"" Bakane said.The stoppages have lasted for several hours at most, affecting spinning of about 2,000 bales of cotton, Bakane said.That represents just a sliver of Frontier's annual demand for some 940,000 480-lb bales, but it also means opportunity cost and other production strains.""Whenever you have to shut down a mill and then restart, you have all kinds of efficiency problems,"" he said. Duke Energy, the nation's largest utility, has twice asked industrial customers in the Carolinas curtail power usage this month as snow and cold gripped the region, a spokeswoman said.Industrial users can opt into contracts with utility providers in which they agree to power interruptions for rebates, said Paige Layne, a spokeswoman for Duke Energy.""When we're looking at historic lows, this is one of the tools our grid operators have available instead of rolling blackouts or other load-shed programs,"" Layne told Reuters.Traditionally, industrial users are asked to crimp demand during heat waves, as most residents use air-conditioning. Duke Energy saw a record energy usage peak on Jan. 7 of 20,246 megawatt-hours, surpassing December 2010's record of 18,985 megawatt-hours.A LOGISTICS 'DISASTER' While the impact on the textile industry has so far been small, hampering but not halting operations, it comes at a significant time for the U.S. textile industry. Companies around the world are setting up shop in the United states, drawn as much by lower-cost and reliable energy as by shifting trade flows and improving technology.""If it were to happen every week, that would be an issue,"" said a source at another U.S. mill, who declined to be named as he is not authorized to speak with the press.He said that his milling operation had lost two days of production altogether.The increased demand for electricity is just one example of how this winter's historic cold has roiled industry.Natural gas prices have spiked 20 percent so far this year as demand has surged.Extreme cold, ice, and snow drifts have congested up rail, port and road travel.""Logistics are a disaster this week,"" said Jordan Lea, chairman and co-owner of Eastern Trading in South Carolina.

3,"  Feb 8 Workers on Saturday plugged a broken pipe that leaked up to 82,000 tons of power plant coal ash into a North Carolina river, Duke Energy Corp said.Crews filled part of the stormwater pipe with concrete and capped it, and the rest of the pipe will be filled with concrete as well, said Duke, the biggest U.S. electric power provider.""Plugging the pipe was clearly job one, but we're continuing our efforts and working closely with all the agencies involved in this response,"" Charlie Gates, senior vice president for power generation operations, said in the statement.Duke's next step is to keep monitoring water quality, he said. The ash release was discovered on Sunday at the power plant in Eden, North Carolina, which was retired in 2012. The company said the pipe under a 27-acre (11-hectare) ash pond released enough coal ash to fill between 20 and 32 Olympic-size swimming pools.An estimated 24 million to 27 million gallons (91 million to 102 million liters) of ash basin water also reached the river, Duke said. Before the pipe was sealed, Duke installed a catch basin and pumps at its end to reduce outflow to the river. Samples by Duke and the state Department of Environment and Natural Resources show that water quality is improving, the company said. Waterkeeper Alliance, a water advocacy group, said this week that analysis of Dan River samples showed ""extremely high levels"" of arsenic, chromium, iron, lead and other toxic metals typically found in coal ash.A Duke Energy spokesman has said tests by the utility and North Carolina officials indicated no adverse impact on the water supply.",2014-02-09,DUK,"Sat Feb 8, 2014 | 9:39pm EST",Utility stops leak of coal ash into North Carolina river,http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-northcarolina-spill-idUSL2N0LE02X20140209?type=companyNews
4,"   By Mica Rosenberg  Feb 11 North Carolina has asked a state judge to put a controversial settlement deal with U.S. power company Duke Energy over pollution on hold after a massive coal ash spill into a local river raised fresh concerns about water safety.Last week Duke said a pipe broke at one of its retired coal plants, spilling 50,000 to 82,000 tons of ash, enough to fill 20 to 32 Olympic-size swimming pools, into North Carolina's Dan River.The accident occurred amid a long-running legal battle over the storage of coal ash waste at Duke facilities. The company owns all of North Carolina's 14 coal-fired power plants, though some are in the process of being decommissioned.North Carolina's Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) filed lawsuits last year against Duke Energy  alleging water quality violations at the company's plants.It then proposed a settlement agreement with the company in July that would levy $99,000 in fines and order increased monitoring of possible contamination at the sites.""We were already addressing coal ash ponds through our multiple lawsuits against Duke Energy and we will continue on that course once we have an updated assessment of the situation statewide,"" DENR Secretary John Skvarla said in a statement on Tuesday.""This experience may cause us to reevaluate the proposed consent order,"" he said.Lawyers for North Carolina sent a letter on Monday to Judge Pat Ridgeway in the Wake County Superior Court, who is handling the suits, to ask for the postponement. Environmental groups say coal ash in the state, a byproduct of power plants containing heavy metals that can cause cancer and nervous system damage, is stored in antiquated or unlined pits and risks seeping into groundwater and nearby rivers.The Southern Environmental Law Center, which intervened in the lawsuits, assailed the proposed settlement for failing to require a cleanup of the coal ash contamination.DENR received almost 5,000 public comments, nearly all of them negative, on the settlement. Some changes were made to the deal after the comment period but green groups said the fines remained small and there was still no requirement for comprehensive cleanup. PIPE PLUGGED Duke spokeswoman Lisa Hoffmann said that while the company was eager to complete the work outlined in the proposed settlement agreement, ""the event at Dan River is a good reason to take a fresh look at our plans moving forward.""On Saturday, Duke said workers successfully plugged the pipe under the 27-acre (11-hectare) ash pond, which broke on Feb. 2.Working with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and state officials, Duke is testing a coal ash removal system in a small section of the river where a lot of sediment accumulated after the release, Hoffman said. While Duke says water quality continues to improve in the Dan River, the Waterkeeper Alliance, a water advocacy group, said its analysis had shown ""extremely high levels"" of arsenic, chromium, iron, lead and other toxic metals.""The reason this happened is that Duke poorly designed these coal ash lagoons, building them on top of a storm water pipe,"" said Frank Holleman from the Southern Environmental Law Center. ""Next to a river is no place to store this kind of dangerous substance,"" he said. ""There is a threat every day of another catastrophic spill.""The center is also involved in two federal court cases against the company over the coal ash pollution. Duke has filed motions to dismiss both cases, which are still pending, Holleman said.On Sunday, North Carolina's DENR admitted it had miscalculated the levels of arsenic in the river, initially reporting that sampling showed the water was safe, when it actually exceeded the standards for human health.""We made an honest mistake while interpreting the results,"" said Tom Reeder, the director of water resources at DENR, in a news release. The state agency recommended that people avoid ""prolonged direct contact"" with the river until further notice.DENR also said it would be creating a special task force of experts to review the state's coal ash ponds.Concerns about coal ash storage ponds were raised long before the Dan River spill, peaking in 2008 when a dam collapse inundated a small community in Tennessee with toxic coal sludge.",2014-02-12,DUK,"Tue Feb 11, 2014 | 7:22pm EST",North Carolina asks to halt settlement after Duke coal ash spill,http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-environment-duke-idUSL2N0LG2BI20140212?type=companyNews
5,"   By Colleen Jenkins | WINSTON-SALEM, North Carolina  WINSTON-SALEM, North Carolina U.S. prosecutors are investigating whether a crime was committed when thousands of tons of coal ash sludge spilled from a Duke Energy power plant in North Carolina in early February into a river that supplies drinking water for nearby towns.Subpoenas were received this week by Duke Energy, which retired the coal-fired power plant in Eden in 2012, and the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources regulator, spokesmen for the two entities said on Thursday.The U.S. Attorney's Office in Raleigh ordered officials with the state agency to appear before a grand jury next month with documents related to the spill that began on February 2, according to a copy of the subpoena provided to Reuters by the department.The spokesman for Duke, which installed a permanent plug at the site to stop releases from the ash basin on February 8, declined to share a copy of the company's subpoena.

13,"   By Eric M. Johnson  Feb 19 North Carolina on Tuesday ordered Duke Energy Corp to plug a leak of contaminated wastewater from a decommissioned power plant, which authorities in the state said might be leaking into a river that supplies drinking water.The arsenic-laced discharge from a 36-inch stormwater pipe was the second this month from beneath a coal ash dump at the Eden plant.In early February, thousands of tons of sludge spilled into the Dan River after a 48-inch pipe broke under the 27-acre ash pond, Duke said.The company - which is mired in a long-running legal battle with the state over the storage of coal ash waste - said on Tuesday it would use a temporary system to cap the second discharge until it developed a permanent scheme. Pipe water samples indicated elevated levels of arsenic, though the duration and volume of the discharge was not known, the Charlotte, N.C.-based firm said.""Downstream public water supplies remain safe and the river meets all water quality standards,"" it said, adding it was continuously sampling and monitoring water in the Dan River. The additional discharge was identified during an investigation by the state, the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources said on Tuesday.""This second stormwater pipe ... may also be leaking water contaminated with coal ash pollutants into the Dan River,"" said Division of Water Resources director Tom Reeder. The state regulatory agency was to hold a press conference at 12:30 p.m. (1730 GMT) on Wednesday.U.S. prosecutors are investigating whether a crime was committed in the first spill, in which Duke said 30,000 to 39,000 tons of ash were released into the river.The coal-fired plant was built in the 1940s and retired in 2012.

Feb 25 State regulators in North Carolina may force Duke Energy Corp to move thousands of tons of coal ash from storage ponds at a power plant to a lined landfill after a massive spill this month contaminated water and wildlife in the Dan River.The state's Department of Environmental and Natural Resources (DENR) said on Tuesday that it planned to modify a permit that has allowed Duke to discharge certain amounts of wastewater from its retired facility in Eden, North Carolina, into the river.At least 30,000 tons of toxic coal ash were released into the Dan River when a pipe broke under the 27-acre (11-hectare) ash pond in a spill discovered on Feb. 2. State officials found a second leak of arsenic-laced discharge from another pipe during their investigation.Both leaks have been plugged, according to Duke and the state regulator. Two towns in neighboring Virginia, Danville and South Boston, get their drinking water from the river.Tom Reeder, director of the regulator's Division of Water Resources, said his agency is focusing on how to protect the river now that the spills have been stopped. ""Based on our investigation of this spill, one option under consideration right now is to eliminate all coal ash waste discharges coming from this facility and require that Duke Energy move the coal ash waste stored onsite to a lined landfill away from any waterways,"" Reeder said in a statement.Duke has 60 days to comment on proposed changes to the permit.""We will respond to the state and work to determine the most appropriate resolution,"" Duke spokesman Thomas Williams said. ""As we have stated, our company is taking another look at how we manage ash basins."" The landfill solution has been long favored by environmentalists concerned about the risks posed by the ash.""It is a good sign that DENR has, in writing, embraced our solution of moving the coal ash out of these unlined lagoons,"" said Frank Holleman, senior attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center. ""But we need action, not merely words."" Federal prosecutors have issued subpoenas to employees of Duke and the state environmental regulator as part of a widening probe into possible felony violations at North Carolina's 14 coal ash sites.The agency has come under fire for its handling of the state's coal ash ponds, which it concedes are contaminating groundwater. It filed suit against Duke last year, and then proposed a settlement that environmental groups oppose.That proposed settlement has been on hold since the spill. In a letter dated Feb. 20, DENR notified a judge that it may move forward with the settlement. The agency must decide by March 21 how to proceed.While the action announced by the state on Tuesday would apply only to the Dan River site, a task force within the agency is reviewing discharge permits at the state's 13 other coal ash sites, all owned by Duke.Drinking water from the river has been deemed safe once it is treated. State officials started testing fish tissue this week to determine if fish from the river is safe to eat. They have advised people not to eat the fish for now and to avoid prolonged contact with the water.",2014-02-26,DUK,"Tue Feb 25, 2014 | 9:24pm EST",North Carolina may order Duke Energy to move coal ash after spill,http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-northcarolina-spill-idUSL1N0LV03X20140226?type=companyNews

17,"   By Colleen Jenkins | WINSTON-SALEM, N.C., March 3  WINSTON-SALEM, N.C., March 3 North Carolina regulators have cited Duke Energy Corp for environmental violations at six power plants in a probe prompted by a massive spill at one facility that dumped up to 39,000 tons of coal ash into a river used for drinking water.The state's Department of Environment and Natural Resources, which is facing scrutiny from federal prosecutors and watchdog groups for its regulation of the decommissioned Eden plant where the spill occurred, said on Monday that Duke failed to obtain federally required stormwater permits at five plants.The notices of violation followed two others announced on Friday for a sixth plant, the Eden facility, where regulators cited the utility for wastewater and stormwater violations.The state said Duke, the country's largest electric power provider, could face steep civil fines for neither applying for nor obtaining the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit needed to discharge stormwater from steam electric power generating facilities into state waters. ""Our agency is determined to make sure that all of these facilities are in compliance with state and federal law,"" said John Skvarla, the state agency's secretary. ""We're doing everything in our power to prevent environmental disasters like what we've seen at the Dan River.""The Charlotte, North Carolina-based company has between 15 and 30 days to reply to state regulators investigating its coal ash ponds.""We will respond to the state,"" Duke spokeswoman Paige Sheehan said. State officials said they reviewed the permit status of all 14 of the company's plants in the state after a spill of toxic coal ash discovered on Feb. 2 threatened water and wildlife in the Dan River.The discharge from the spill, which occurred when a 48-inch (122-cm) stormwater pipe beneath a coal ash pond ruptured, released between 24 million and 27 million gallons (91 million to 102 million liters) of wastewater and as many as 39,000 tons of coal combustion residuals into the river that supplies drinking water to two towns in neighboring Virginia. State officials found a second leak of arsenic-laced discharge from another pipe during their investigation at the coal-fired plant, which was built in the 1940s and retired in 2012.Both leaks were plugged. Officials have said treated water is safe for drinking but advised against eating fish from the river or having prolonged contact with the water. Coal combustion residuals from the spill have been identified as far as 70 miles (113 km) downstream, officials say.U.S. prosecutors opened a criminal investigation into the spill and have requested that inspection records and copies of correspondence between the state environmental agency and Duke Energy be produced for a grand jury later this month.The five other facilities cited for violating environmental standards are located in the counties of Rockingham, Rutherford County, Wayne, Person and New Hanover, the state said.",2014-03-03,DUK,"Mon Mar 3, 2014 | 4:36pm EST",Duke Energy cited for violations at six plants after coal ash spill,http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-northcarolina-spill-idUSL1N0M01FW20140303?type=companyNews
18,"   By Ian Simpson  A North Carolina judge ruled on Thursday that Duke Energy Corp must immediately stop the sources of groundwater pollution at its 14 coal-fired power plants in the state.The issue of pollution from coal ash gained momentum in North Carolina last month, when a spill from a retired Duke power plant dumped at least 30,000 tons of ash in the Dan River.In the ruling, Wake County Superior Court Judge Paul Ridgeway reversed a decision by the North Carolina Environmental Management Commission. He said the panel failed to apply state law properly when it did not force the utility to clean up its coal ash ponds.The appeal of the commission's decision was brought in 2012 by a consortium of environmental groups, including the Cape Fear River Watch and the Sierra Club. Duke, the biggest U.S. electric power provider, could appeal the ruling. In a statement, it said, ""We're considering this ruling as we take another look at our management of coal ash basins.""At issue was whether the commission had the authority to force Duke to take immediate action to clean up the coal ash ponds. ""The ruling leaves no doubt, Duke Energy is past due on its obligation to eliminate the sources of groundwater contamination, its unlined coal ash pits,"" D.J. Gerken, an attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center who represented the conservation groups in the case, said in a statement.""The state has both the authority and a duty to require action now,"" he said. Federal prosecutors have issued subpoenas to employees of Duke and the state Department of Environment and Natural Resources as part of a widening probe into possible felony violations at the 14 coal ash sites.The North Carolina court decision came a day after Alpha Natural Resources Inc said it would spend $200 million to settle a dispute with the U.S. government over pollution discharged by coal mines.(Reporting by Ian Simpson; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)",2014-03-06,DUK,"Thu Mar 6, 2014 | 3:10pm EST",Duke ordered to stop groundwater pollution at North Carolina coal plants,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-usa-northcarolina-ash-idUSBREA2524G20140306?type=companyNews

Last week, a federal grand jury convened in Raleigh as part of a probe into the company's handling of coal ash.Federal prosecutors are also investigating the state environmental regulator, the Department of the Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), for its handling of Duke's coal-ash ponds in the state, which it admits are contaminating groundwater.Earlier this month a judge ordered Duke to immediately clean up the coal-ash ponds as part of a separate state lawsuit filed by environmental groups last year. A settlement proposed by DENR and decried by environmentalists as too lenient was dropped by the state last week. Governor Pat McCrory, a former Duke executive, has implored the company to do more to clean up the ponds.Good said in the letter that the moves are part of a ""disciplined, fact-based approach to evaluating long-term solutions"" to coal-ash storage. She said all of Duke's coal-ash sites are being reviewed both by an internal task force and outside experts who will report back by the end of May.The company will have plans in place to secure ash basins at the rest of its seven retired plants by the end of the year, Good said.""It is good to see the utility becoming publicly responsive to the situation,"" DENR spokesman Jamie Kritzer said in a written statement responding to Wednesday's announcement.Attorney Frank Holleman of the Southern Environmental Law Center was more skeptical.""Duke has yet to make it clear what it is going to do for the other 11 communities (in North Carolina) that are still faced with the possibility of a catastrophe,"" he said.

24,"  * Adjusted profit $1.17/share vs est. $1.12* Operating revenue rises 12 pct to $6.62 bln* Operating revenue from regulated utilities rises 14 pct   (Adds comments from CEO, CFO, analyst; updates shares)By Swetha GopinathMay 7 Duke Energy Corp, the largest U.S. power company by market value, reported a better-than-expected adjusted profit for the second straight quarter as a particularly harsh winter boosted power demand.The company, which derives more than 80 percent of its revenue from utilities whose rates are regulated by states, also benefited after North Carolina, South Carolina and Florida approved its request to raise rates last year.Duke, which sells power to 7.2 million customers in North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Indiana, Ohio and Kentucky,     said operating revenue from regulated electric utilities rose 14 percent to $5.58 billion in the first quarter ended March 31. ""In our service territories we are starting to see, hopefully on a continued basis, a rebound in electricity consumption by our residential and commercial customers,"" Chief Financial Officer Steven Young told Reuters.Duke, which struggled with tepid power sales after the recession of 2008 as customers cut spending, said this was the third consecutive quarter of economic growth in their markets.Duke spent $15 million in the first quarter to clean up a massive spill of toxic coal ash into the Dan River in North Carolina. Chief Executive Lynn Good said additional costs would not be material. The company said last month moving its coal-ash dumps away from rivers and lakes in North Carolina may cost it $2 billion to $10 billion.Duke said it took a $1.4 billion charge in the first quarter to write down the value of the Midwest commercial generation business, which it plans to sell to shield itself from volatile prices for power sold on the wholesale market.UBS analysts said the 13 plants on sale had a fair value of $2.2 billion. Duke is selling 11 plants in Ohio and one each in Illinois and Pennsylvania. ""It is apparent that the power renaissance and seemingly more M&A demand has been a factor in lifting the valuation, although ash liabilities appear to be traveling with the portfolio,"" the analysts wrote in a note.Young said Duke was talking to potential buyers and plans to close the sale by the fourth quarter or the first quarter.Excluding the writedown of the plants, first-quarter profit was $1.17 per share, above the average analyst estimate of $1.12, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Duke's customer base is second only to that of Exelon Corp , which said last month it would buy Pepco Holdings Inc  for $6.83 billion, bumping up its number of customers to 10 million.Duke's operating revenue rose 12 percent to $6.62 billion, beating the average analyst estimate of $6.44 billion.Duke's shares have risen 6 percent this year to Tuesday's close, valuing the company at $51.66 billion. They were up 1 percent at $73.61 on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday.

25,"  May 7 Duke Energy Corp, the largest U.S. power company by market capitalization, swung to a quarterly loss after taking a $1.4 billion charge to write down the value of its Midwest commercial generation business.Duke Energy said in February that it planned to sell the business, including stakes in 13 power plants, citing ""volatile returns"" in a competitive market.  The company posted a net loss of $97 million, or 14 cents per share, in the first quarter ended March 31, compared with a profit of $634 million, or 89 cents per share, a year earlier.

26,"  May 22 Duke Energy Corp has agreed to find and remove coal ash that a retired North Carolina power plant spilled into the Dan River, which provides drinking water to two towns in nearby Virginia, U.S. environmental regulators said on Thursday.The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will oversee the cleanup, and Duke will reimburse EPA for current and future costs, a statement issued by the EPA said.On Feb. 2, a 48-inch (122-cm) stormwater pipe beneath a coal ash pond ruptured at the retired Eden coal plant and released between 24 million and 27 million gallons (91 million to 102 million liters) of wastewater and as many as 39,000 tons of coal combustion residue into the Dan river that supplies drinking water to two towns in Virginia. Coal ash, a byproduct of coal-based power production, contains heavy metals that can contaminate drinking water and harm marine life.The assessment and cleanup work in North Carolina and Virginia will be subject to approval by EPA and state environmental agencies, the statement said. ""In addition, the Order also requires Duke to reimburse all past EPA response costs, as well as all future oversight costs in connection with the site."" The terms of the Order require that the disposal of coal ash from the spill meet protective disposal standards for landfills, such as synthetic liners, leachate collection systems and groundwater monitoring.Duke Energy, the country's largest electric power provider, retired the Eden coal plant in 2012. No coal ash has been produced at the site since then.

27,"   By Marti Maguire | RALEIGH N.C.  RALEIGH N.C. North Carolina's state Senate on Wednesday unanimously approved a bill calling for the closure of Duke Energy's 33 coal ash ponds in the state within 15 years, legislation spurred by a massive spill at a retired power plant earlier this year.Members of the chamber touted the measure as the nation’s toughest law regulating coal ash, a byproduct of coal-based power production that contains toxic materials such as arsenic and lead.“This is a change that’s going to have North Carolina leading the country when it comes to getting rid of coal ash,” said Republican state Senator Tom Apodaca, who sponsored the bill.Environmentalists raised doubts, however, that the provisions are strong enough to put a dent in the nation's coal ash problem. The clean-up plan uses a tiered approach to dictate when ponds at 14 sites statewide must be closed. At the most dangerous sites, including four named in the bill, coal ash would have to be moved to lined landfills or reused as building material by 2019. At sites deemed less dangerous, the cleanup requirements are less stringent and less urgent. Critics of the bill took issue with a provision that would allow the ash to be capped and left in place at sites deemed low risk.“It is really leaving the polluting coal ash in unlined pits next to waterways,” said Frank Holleman, an attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center. California-based nonprofit Earthjustice, which tracks coal ash sites and is pushing for federal oversight, says more than 200 of the nation's 1,400 coal ash sites have contaminated nearby waterways.  At least 30,000 tons of coal ash were released into the Dan River when a pipe broke under the 27-acre (11-hectare) ash pond at a retired plant owned by Duke Energy in Eden, North Carolina, in a spill discovered on Feb. 2. The Senate bill mandates water quality monitoring around all the state's coal ash pond sites and exploration of methods to reuse coal ash. The measure did not require Duke to pay for clean-up costs rather than passing them on to customers. A Duke Energy spokesman called the timeline set by the Senate “incredibly aggressive,” cutting in half the years the company has proposed for clean-up. Governor Pat McCrory, a Republican and former Duke executive, has voiced support for a House bill similar to the version passed by the Senate. The two chambers must agree on a final version before seeking McCrory’s signature.

32,"   By Edward McAllister  The U.S. Coast Guard closed a 15-mile stretch of the Ohio River on Tuesday after at least five thousand gallons of fuel oil spilled from a 60-year-old power plant owned by Duke Energy 20 miles east of Cincinnati, Ohio. The spill occurred at 11:15 p.m. on Monday during a ""routine transfer of fuel oil"" at the W.C. Beckjord plant in New Richmond and was stopped 15 minutes later, Duke said. Intakes for drinking water along the river were closed overnight and drinking water has not been affected, said a spokeswoman for the Greater Cincinnati Water Works, though tests continue. The impact on wildlife was so far unclear.""We notified state and local authorities of the incident and have been working with them throughout the overnight hours,"" said Chuck Whitlock, Duke Energy president of Midwest Commercial Generation. ""We have cleanup crews on site that are identifying the appropriate actions that will be needed to remediate."" The Coast Guard said the river was closed from mile markers 453 to 468, from Cincinnati to Dayton, Kentucky, while it responded to the spill. Three vessels were on the scene on Tuesday deploying oil containment booms and clean-up materials. The Coast Guard's initial estimate was that 8,000 gallons were spilled.The W.C. Beckjord Station is being retired as a result of new government emissions standards. Four of the plant's six coal-fired units have been closed and the remaining two are expected to shut down by the end of the year. It also has four fuel-oil-fired units that generate power during periods of peak demand. The Ohio River, which stretches nearly 1,000 miles from Pennsylvania to Illinois, provides drinking water for more than three million people, according to the Ohio River Foundation. It is also a major artery for shipping grain by barge from the eastern United States to export terminals on the U.S. Gulf Coast.

Duke Energy Corp, the largest provider of electric power in the United States, will invest $500 million in a major expansion of its solar power program in North Carolina, the Charlotte-based company said Monday. The company plans to acquire and finish building three solar power farms under development in rural areas in the eastern part of the state that will produce a total of 128 megawatts of capacity of electric power. One of them, the Warsaw Solar Facility developed by Solar Strata, will be the largest solar power generation site east of the Mississippi River, the company said. Duke has also agreed to buy power from five solar projects for a total of 150 megawatts of capacity. The move will help the company meet state requirements that energy companies generate 12.5 percent of their power through renewable sources by 2020.  The use of solar power has been increasing nationally in recent years, with more than half of all new capacity coming from solar projects in the first half of 2014, according to a report released this month by the Solar Energy Industries Association. The 278 megawatts that Duke Energy will add represents a small fraction of the nearly 50,000 megawatts of capacity produced nationally by company.  But Duke Energy officials said the moves amount to the company’s largest single jump in solar energy production, and will result in a 60 percent increase in the amount of solar power used by its North Carolina customers. “We are bringing large amounts of renewable energy onto our system in the most cost-effective way possible,"" Rob Caldwell, a senior vice president, said in a statement.Renewable energy advocates lauded the announcement, while also calling for the company to do more in expanding its use of cleaner technologies.",2014-09-15,DUK,"Mon Sep 15, 2014 | 6:04pm EDT",Duke Energy to invest $500 million in North Carolina solar power,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-usa-duke-energy-solar-idUSKBN0HA2CH20140915?type=companyNews

Duke said it was the second cool summer in a row.""Although the weather this summer was milder than usual, we remain on track to meet our financial objectives for 2014 and beyond,"" said Chief Executive Lynn Good said in a statement.The company sells power to 7.2 million customers in North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Indiana, Ohio and Kentucky.Expenses for fuel used in power generation and purchase in the regulated sector rose 6 percent while it shot up 14 percent in the non-regulated business in the third quarter, the company said. Duke is increasing its reliance on natural gas as it retires some coal plants to comply with U.S. environmental regulations. Natural gas is expected to account for a third of the company's fuel mix next year, CEO Good told Reuters. Use of natural gas to generate power has expanded to about 20 percent in 2014 from less than a ""few percent"" in 2008, Good said.Duke, which also runs nuclear power plants, said in September that it would own a 40 percent stake in a new $5-billion natural gas pipeline that will run through West Virginia, Virginia and North Carolina.

45,"  (Adds details, background)SAN FRANCISCO Jan 5 California Governor Jerry Brown on Monday laid out an ambitious plan for 50 percent of the state's electricity to be generated by renewable resources over the next 15 years and to cut petroleum usage by drivers.Brown, who was sworn in for an unprecedented fourth term, said he would also seek to double the energy efficiency of existing buildings and make heating fuels cleaner.""I envision a wide range of initiatives: more distributed power, expanded rooftop solar, micro-grids, an energy imbalance market, battery storage, the full integration of information technology and electrical distribution and millions of electric and low-carbon vehicles,"" Brown said in his speech in Sacramento. The state has pushed to implement far-reaching climate change policies, including its landmark AB 32 law aimed at reducing carbon pollution back to 1990 levels by 2020. Brown said California was on track to meet its goal of generating one-third of the state's electricity through renewable energy within the next five years. The governor's new initiative could be a boon for green energy companies, such as manufacturers of electric vehicles and those looking to build utility-scale solar projects or upgrade the state's aging electric grid.SolarCity Corp, the largest U.S. residential solar panel installer, and Vivint Solar Inc are already big players in California. NRG Energy Inc, a top competitor on the East Coast, announced in November that it aimed to open new offices in California. A trio of companies including Duke Energy Corp in September proposed an $8 billion green energy initiative for Los Angeles.Since 2013 California's cap-and-trade program has raised nearly $1 billion from companies to offset their carbon emissions. The money could increase significantly as the program expands this year to cover distributors of transportation fuel like gasoline and diesel and home heating fuels like natural gas.

46,"   By Nichola Groom  Feb 11 Apple Inc's deal to buy nearly $1 billion of power from a massive First Solar Inc  plant could be the first of a stampede of contracts driven by the looming change in a solar tax incentive that makes such projects particularly attractive.Together with a sharp drop in the cost of solar power and corporate efforts to rack up green credentials, the expiring tax subsidies have large energy purchasers taking a hard look at buying solar under big long-term contracts.Apple on Tuesday said it would spend $848 million over 25 years to buy 130 megawatts of electricity from a 280 MW plant - the solar industry's largest-ever corporate power purchase agreement, or PPA.Apple's major financial commitment gives solar a level of mainstream credibility that should entice other new customers.""This is a market-making type of transaction,"" said Tom Werner, chief executive of SunPower Corp, a U.S. solar company that is majority owned by France's Total SA.SunPower is already seeing a rush to get projects done before a critical federal tax credit for solar projects drops to 10 percent from 30 percent in 2017, Werner added. SunPower, First Solar, SunEdison Inc, Recurrent Energy LLC, which is being acquired by solar panel maker Canadian Solar Inc, and 8minutenergy Renewables LLC are among the developers of the massive solar installations that have cropped up to serve the utility industry. Their size can rival that of a coal- or natural gas-fired plant.The Apple-First Solar deal could serve as a template for other big companies like Google Inc and Facebook Inc  to use large-scale solar plants to bypass utilities when they need to power their operations.""Given the profile of Apple and their reputation we think it's going to stimulate a lot of other companies that may not have programs as active as Apple's to ask questions - is there a smarter better way we can procure our energy?,"" First Solar CEO Jim Hughes said in an interview. COST IS KING To be competitive in the market, large-scale solar projects need to be able to sell power for about 5 cents per kwh, a cost level that is starting to become feasible for the technology, although just barely, according to Shayle Kann, senior vice president of research at market research firm GTM Research. With large solar projects, customers can save between 15 and 20 percent off their energy bills over the course of a contract, according to Ed Lieberman, vice president of customer development at CustomerFirst Renewables, a Washington-based firm that advises large organizations on renewable power procurement.The deadline to claim the full 30 percent federal tax credit should drive a boom in activity over the next two years, Lieberman added.About 14 gigawatts of utility-scale projects are scheduled to come online in 2015 and 2016, compared with just 1 GW in 2017, according to Shayle Kann, senior vice president of research at market research firm GTM Research.Corporations and other non-utility customers will buy more than 100 MW of the power from those projects this year and potentially more than double that next year, Kann said.Even before Apple's announcement on Tuesday, the market was growing. Apple already had plans to power a new Arizona data center with solar power. And last year Duke Energy Corp  reached a 20-year deal to sell power from a 52 MW project in North Carolina to The George Washington University, American University and George Washington University Hospital.Also last year, the University of California signed 25-year agreements to buy 80 MW of power from two Frontier Renewables LLC projects in Fresno County.

54,"  Duke Energy Corp said it would pay $146 million to settle a shareholder lawsuit related to the ouster of its chief executive following its merger with Progress Energy in 2012.Duke's board voted to replace Progress CEO Bill Johnson with Duke CEO James Rogers at the helm of the combined company hours after the $18 billion merger closed.Johnson's ouster prompted an investigation by regulators, who had approved the deal on the understanding that he would lead the combined company. Rogers was slated to be executive chairman.Rating agencies also considered cutting Duke's debt rating. On Tuesday, the largest U.S. power company by market value said the settlement would avoid the cost of prolonged litigation and eliminate uncertainty related to the lawsuit.Insurance will cover most of the settlement amount, while shareholders, not customers, will pay the rest, Duke said.

56,"  U.S. power company Duke Energy Corp agreed to a $2.5 million settlement proposed by the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality relating to the 2014 coal ash spill into the Dan River in North Carolina, the DEQ said on Friday. Duke, the largest in the United States by power generation capacity, will spend $2.25 million in carrying out environmental projects to benefit Virginia localities affected by the spill. The remaining $250,000 will be placed in a DEQ fund to respond to environmental emergencies. A pipe break at a retired Duke coal plant in February 2014 triggered the third-worst coal ash spill in U.S. history. The event prompted North Carolina's Senate to ask Duke to close 33 coal ash ponds in the state within 15 years. The accident occurred amid a long-running legal battle over the storage of coal ash waste at Duke facilities. The company said it had set aside $100 million in the fourth quarter in anticipation of the settlement. A public comment period on the proposed order will be open through May 20, 2015. Afterward, the State Water Control Board must give final approval for the order to take effect, DEQ said.

59,"   By Shubhankar Chakravorty  Duke Energy Corp (DUK.N), the largest U.S. power company by generation capacity, reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit as exceptionally cold winter weather boosted electricity demand.Duke, which sells power to 7.3 million customers in North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Indiana, Ohio and Kentucky, said adjusted income in its regulated power business rose 5 percent to $774 million.""Our customers needed a record amount of electricity during the exceptionally cold weather in February,"" Chief Executive Lynn Good said in a statement on Friday.Net income attributable to Duke was $864 million, or $1.22 per share, in the first quarter ended March 31, compared with a loss of $97 million, or 14 cents per share, a year earlier. The year earlier quarter included an impairment charge of about $1.4 billion related to the company's non-regulated Midwest generation business, which was later sold to Dynegy Inc (DYN.N).The company has been cutting exposure to the volatility of wholesale power markets and focusing on regulated markets, where power prices are stable.For the latest quarter, adjusted profit was $1.24 per share, topping the average analyst estimate of $1.14 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Duke, which also operates in Brazil, Argentina and Chile, said adjusted income from its international business fell 72 percent, mainly due to a multi-year drought in Brazil that hurt hydro-electric generation.The company has been converting some of its coal-powered plants into cheaper and less polluting plants that run on natural gas. ""Low natural gas prices are a very significant benefit for our customers and they've enjoyed these prices as we've continued to add natural gas for our system,"" Good told Reuters.Duke shares closed at $77.57 on the New York Stock Exchange after rising 4 percent in the past 12 months.

63,"   By Marti Maguire | RALEIGH, N.C.  RALEIGH, N.C. Duke Energy Corp pleaded guilty on Thursday to environmental crimes over a North Carolina power plant's coal ash spill into a river and management of coal ash basins in the state, U.S. prosecutors said.The plea entered in federal court in Greenville, North Carolina, by the country's largest utility owner was expected under a settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice announced in February.As part of the deal, Duke agreed to pay $102 million in fines and environmental projects, and to reserve more than $3 billion to comply with environmental standards.“Duke Energy's crimes reflect a breach of the public trust and a lack of stewardship for the natural resources belonging to all of the citizens of North Carolina,” U.S. Attorney Thomas Walker said in a statement.The company admitted to failures at five of its power plants over several decades that allowed coal ash to enter waterways, including documented problems with the 48-inch pipe that would eventually cause the spill into the Dan River in February 2014. The stormwater pipe beneath a coal ash pond at Duke's retired power plant in Eden ruptured, releasing up to 27 million gallons of wastewater and as many as 39,000 tons of coal combustion residue into the river that supplies drinking water to two towns in neighboring Virginia.Duke “failed to take reasonable steps to minimize or prevent discharge of coal ash to the Dan River that would adversely affect the environment,"" according to a joint statement filed by the company and prosecutors in federal court. Duke and its subsidiaries pleaded guilty to nine misdemeanor violations of the Clean Water Act. In a statement on Tuesday, the company pledged to ""operate our system as safely as possible.""Duke has separately agreed to close and clean up coal ash sites at 14 coal plants in North Carolina, though their methods have been disputed.  Duke’s environmental critics lauded the settlement, one of the largest levied for clean water violations, but noted other lawsuits continue.“This confirms that Duke has committed serious and long-standing environmental crimes,” said John Suttles, an attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center. “But it does not clean up the coal ash that is every day continuing to contaminate our drinking water.”  (Additional reporting by Jim Brumm; Editing by Grant McCool, Diane Craft, Letitia Stein and Bernard Orr)",2015-05-14,DUK,"Thu May 14, 2015 | 5:35pm EDT",Duke Energy pleads guilty to environmental crimes in North Carolina,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-duke-energy-spill-idUSKBN0NZ25920150514?type=companyNews

67,"  (Adds details, background)May 19 Duke Energy Corp, the largest U.S. power company by generation capacity, said it would invest $1.1 billion to retire a coal-powered power plant in North Carolina and build a natural gas plant at the site over four to five years.The company said it will shut down the 376-megawatt (MW) Asheville coal power plant and build a 650-MW natural gas-fired power plant, and also install solar generation at the site.The investment includes about $320 million to build a transmission substation, a 40-mile transmission line and upgrade infrastructure, the company said. Duke last week pleaded guilty to environmental crimes over a North Carolina power plant's coal ash spill and management of coal ash basins in the state as part of a settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice announced in February.U.S. power companies are shutting down their coal-powered plants as part of the Obama administration's to reduce carbon emissions from such plants. U.S. power companies shut or converted over 4,100 megawatts of coal-fired plants in 2014 and expect to stop burning coal at another 22,100 MW in 2015, according to Thomson Reuters data. Duke said it was working with the local natural gas distributor to upgrade an existing pipeline to supply gas.The company said it would not have to develop 126 MW oil-powered generation to meet peak demand and other investments planned for 2019 following the investment.(Reporting by Shubhankar Chakravorty in Bengaluru; Editing by Kirti Pandey and Sriraj Kalluvila)",2015-05-19,DUK,"Tue May 19, 2015 | 9:46am EDT",UPDATE 1-Duke Energy to convert North Carolina coal plant to natgas,http://www.reuters.com//article/duke-energy-investment-idUSL3N0YA48Y20150519?type=companyNews

105,"   By David Bailey  Duke Energy Corp's board must face a shareholder lawsuit over its abrupt 2012 firing of its newly installed chief executive, a Delaware judge has ruled.In a decision on Wednesday, Delaware Vice Chancellor Sam Glasscock denied Duke's bid to end the case, finding the shareholder plaintiffs plausibly argued that the defendants might have concealed information about their actions from the public and regulators.As part of its $18 billion deal to acquire Progress Energy,  Duke had agreed to install Progress head William Johnson as CEO of the combined company.

According to the lawsuit, the board decided to conceal its plan to oust Johnson because it did not want to risk trying to renegotiate the merger terms or face further questions from state regulators that could delay its approval. They chose instead to wait until a meeting after the acquisition closed to say Johnson was not a good fit to lead the combined company, the lawsuit alleged.The abrupt CEO change brought other federal and state claims in North Carolina and an investigation by the state utilities regulator in North Carolina, where Duke and Progress were headquartered.A settlement with regulators formalized Rogers' exit in 2013.
