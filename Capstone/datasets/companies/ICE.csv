0,"  * Q4 EPS of $2, minus items, tops forecasts by 5 cents* Shares up 0.9 pct around midday* CEO is ""absolutely indifferent"" to NYSE market shareBy John McCrankNEW YORK, Feb 11 IntercontinentalExchange Group  reported a fourth quarter loss on Tuesday because of onetime costs, including those related to its $11 billion purchase of the parent of the New York Stock Exchange, but expense control helped it beat expectations.The exchange and clearing house operator posted a loss of $176 million, or $1.83 a diluted share, compared to a profit of $130 million, or $1.76 a diluted share, a year earlier.Not including onetime costs - such as $131 million from the NYSE Euronext deal and a $190 million impairment charge on an investment in Brazil - ICE earned $2 a share, topping average estimates by 5 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Shares of ICE were up 0.9 percent at $213.96 on Tuesday around midday.ICE closed the NYSE deal in November, giving it an entry into the interest rate futures business through control of Liffe, Europe's No. 2 derivatives market. The deal also marked the Atlanta-based company's first foray into equities, through ownership of the Big Board, and through European stock market operator Euronext, which ICE said it still plans to spin off in an initial public offering before the end of June.MARKET SHARE The New York Stock Exchange began with an agreement in 1792 under a buttonwood tree on Wall Street. It enjoyed a near monopoly on matching buyers and sellers of U.S. stocks for much of the time since then, but in recent decades new competitors have chipped away at its market share, which last month stood at 20.58 percent. BATS Global Markets had 20.54 percent, and Nasdaq OMX Group had 20.02 percent, according to BATS' data. ICE Chief Executive Jeffrey Sprecher said he is ""absolutely indifferent"" to NYSE's market share and that he is more concerned with providing quality services and maximizing shareholder value.""Our strategy around here has never been to run the business for market share or bragging rights,"" Sprecher, who has been a vocal critic of the way U.S. stock markets operate, said on a call with analysts.One of his main issues has been the large rebates on trading fees many stock exchanges, including NYSE, offer to attract order flow, which he has said gives incentives to brokers to act in ways not always in the best interests of their clients.""It is very easy to be the market share leader in that space if one chooses to want to be that. You can change your rate structure and almost instantaneously the order routing algorithms will give you market share,"" said Sprecher, who started out in the energy markets. He said his team has been ""learning a lot"" about the equity markets since November, and that so far, it has been a calculated decision not to focus on building market share.FINANCIALS Revenue grew to $612 million from $324 million a year earlier, boosted in part by transaction and clearing-fee revenues on the back of the NYSE deal. Analysts had expected revenue of $620 million.The shortfall in revenues was mainly caused by lower-than expected transaction fees, said Alex Kramm, an analyst with UBS. He said that was offset by lower-than-expected adjusted operating expenses of $316 million.""We believe 4Q results are largely a sideshow as the focus should be on the integration of NYSE Euronext,"" Kramm said in a note to clients.Atlanta-based ICE said it expects to reach 70 percent of its $500 million target for savings from the NYSE acquisition on a run-rate basis by the end of the year.ICE declared a dividend of 65 cents per share for the first quarter of 2014 with a record date of March 17, 2014 and a payment date of March 31, 2014.",2014-02-11,ICE,"Tue Feb 11, 2014 | 1:07pm EST",UPDATE 2-ICE beats expectations amid integration of NYSE,http://www.reuters.com//article/intercontinentalexchange-results-idUSL2N0LG0K120140211?type=companyNews

4,"   By John Wasik  (The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.)By John WasikCHICAGO You can get most of what you want for your investments from off-the-shelf index funds, but you may have to dig deeper to make your portfolio more productive.For most mainstream investors, a focus on S&P 500 index funds and a general bond market index serves them well. Yet what if you concentrated on a mixture of different asset classes instead of only picking the usual suspects in conventional index funds that hold the most popular stocks and bonds? You may be able to boost returns while insulating yourself from off years.An ""asset-class investing"" approach still relies upon low-cost, passively managed funds as core vehicles, but it puts a greater focus on diversification, which could enhance returns. Giving yourself a piece of every corner of the market means investing in large-, medium- and small-sized companies in developed and emerging markets, plus a broad selection of U.S. and global bonds.How does it differ? Take the standard approach to indexing the U.S. stock market. Most financial advisers would tell you to buy an S&P index fund, which holds the most popular stocks in the U.S. A good choice would be the SPDR S&P 500 ETF, which holds a mostly passive portfolio at an expense ratio of 0.09 percent annually.Since many index funds hold stocks that investors have assigned the highest values to, you may not be getting the best prices on them.What if you shifted to a value approach, and sought bargain-priced stocks?Then you'd want to buy a fund like the DFA US Large Cap Value I fund, which has beaten the S&P 500 index by almost 4 percentage points in annualized return over the past 15 years through March 14. Charging 0.27 percent for annual expenses, the fund has top holdings like Bank of America Corp, Citigroup Inc and Chevron Corp. Over the last three years, it's posted an annualized return of nearly 16 percent through March 14. With this approach, you may realize more upside because these companies aren't valued as highly as companies like Apple Inc and ExxonMobil Corp, which top the popularity contest for U.S. stocks at the moment and sit on top of the holdings for most big-stock index funds.Another aspect of the asset-class approach is to spread your stock allocation across companies of all sizes throughout the world. Combining a value and small-company stake can also be potent.Over time, the return advantage of small-cap value over the S&P 500 index is impressive.The DFA US Small Cap Value Portfolio, for example, has outperformed the S&P index by more than 8 percentage points in annualized returns over the past 15 years. But you probably wouldn't recognize most of the holdings of this fund, which include companies like CNO Financial Group Inc and Esterline Technologies Corp. It costs 0.52 percent annually in expenses. THE BIG PICTURE If there is one theme in asset class investing, it's ignoring what's popular at the time - whether it's a fund or a stock - and hewing to a broad picture of the entire universe of stocks and bonds.Assuming that the mix of funds matches your stomach for risk and can beat inflation, pulling everything together is a matter of finding the best funds in each asset class.DFA funds, which I've cited above, are good vehicles, but are only available through advisers. You can find comparable funds within the iShares, SPDR or Vanguard Groups. Eric Nelson of Servo Management in Oklahoma City employs asset class investing for his clients. His approach is mostly passive, but he tailors each portfolio.Part of the strategy is holding funds that are sagging at the moment, like emerging markets or large-company value. This approach may also entail lower risk since you're not over-concentrated in the highest-priced stocks on the market.Nelson estimates that asset-class investing has returned about 8 percent annually over the past decade, through February, compared to 6 percent for active management and 7 percent for a ""tactical"" strategy that bounces between hot and cold sectors.""Asset class investing is customized to what you are trying to accomplish,"" Nelson says. ""And there's no benefit in buying actively managed funds.""The other key element in the strategy is to be true to the kind of risk you want to take. The trade-off for investing in small companies looking for high return is that they involve more risk in the short term. That's where diversification comes in. By investing in a wide mix of stocks and bonds, Nelson's asset-class portfolio lost only 22 percent in 2008, compared to about 32 percent for active portfolios.Making this strategy work might entail working with an adviser to set up a portfolio of low-cost passive funds or finding a pre-designed portfolio online from services such as Betterment, Wealthfront.com, folioinvesting.com. Just make sure that you have a piece of everything: Large, medium and small companies across the globe and bonds from the U.S. Treasury, corporations, and emerging markets.(Follow us @ReutersMoney or here;Editing by Stephen Powell)",2014-03-17,ICE,"Mon Mar 17, 2014 | 2:06pm EDT",Drop the S&P index fund for asset-class investing,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-column-wasik-idUSBREA2G17720140317?type=companyNews

9,"  * ICE secures anchor investors to buy 33 pct Euronext stake* Euronext listing in Paris, Amsterdam, Brussels at first* Listing seen valuing Euronext at more than 1.5 bln euros   (Adds comments from Euronext CEO, details, background)By Clare HutchisonPARIS/LONDON, May 27 IntercontinentalExchange Group (ICE) has lined up European long-term investors to buy a third of Euronext in its upcoming listing, aiming to allay local regulators' concerns that the pan-European bourse could be snapped up by another foreign firm.ICE said on Tuesday it was pressing ahead with the initial public offering (IPO) of Euronext, which two sources familiar with the matter said could value the European exchanges business at more than 1.5 billion euros ($2.1 billion).The U.S. group had always intended to spin-off Euronext after its $11 billion deal last year to take over NYSE Euronext, which gave it control of the New York Stock Exchange.But its plans have been complicated by concerns in countries such as France and the Netherlands that Euronext might fall into the hands of a foreign rival such as the London Stock Exchange  and Nasdaq.European regulators approved ICE's takeover of NYSE Euronext on condition it kept a 25 percent stake in Euronext for three years, or found appropriate investors to replace it.Sources familiar with the matter told Reuters last month that ICE had secured a group of European investors to buy 25-30 percent of Euronext. The U.S. group said on Tuesday it had line up so-called ""anchor"" investors to take a 33 percent stake.The investors, including French banks BNP Paribas  and Societe Generale, Dutch firm ABN Amro, Belgian government investment vehicle SFPI, European clearing house Euroclear, and a unit of Portugal's Banco BPI, will hold their shares for at least three years, ICE said.They will be sold the shares at a limited discount to the IPO price, it added.The IPO will be on Euronext's Paris, Amsterdam and Brussels bourses in the first instance, with a later listing in Lisbon that will take place before the fourth quarter, ICE said. It did not give further details on the timing or price of the IPO because the prospectus for the listing has to be approved by regulators. A source familiar with the matter said earlier this month the IPO was scheduled for June.The listing and anchor investors will return decision-making at Euronext to Europe after it was centred in New York as part of NYSE Euronext - something which had prompted some market participants to leave Paris for London and elsewhere.Euronext chief executive Dominique Cerutti told reporters on Tuesday that he was confident of strong investor interest in the IPO, despite a number of postponed listings and recent lacklustre market debuts in London.GROWING THE TOP LINE  Euronext operates equity, fixed income and derivatives markets in Paris, Amsterdam, Brussels and Lisbon. The business, which reported profit of $36 million in its first quarter, has also applied for recognised investment exchange status for its London bourse.Cerutti said the listing would allow the business to reduce the footprint it inherited as part of NYSE Euronext, cutting costs and improving efficiency. It has already started that process, having renegotiated its contract with LCH.Clearnet, the clearing house majority-owned by the London Stock Exchange.""There is significant potential for optimisation, meaning growing the top line,"" Cerutti said.He added the newly public company would focus on product innovation, particularly in derivatives, an initiative formerly led by Liffe - Europe's second-largest derivatives exchange now held by ICE.Cerutti said regulatory changes that are pushing more derivatives trading onto exchanges to improve transparency, bank capital constraints encouraging firms to look elsewhere for funding and positive economic trends in Europe should also provide tailwinds for the business.As part of the IPO, both retail and institutional investors in the Netherlands, France, Belgium and Portugal will be offered a chance to buy shares, while institutional investors elsewhere can participate through a private placement.ICE will also offer shares at a discount to the IPO price to all eligible Euronext employees in France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Portugal and Britain.($1 = 0.7325 Euros)   (Additional reporting by Andrew Callus in Paris and Freya Berry in London.; Editing by Mark Potter)",2014-05-27,ICE,"Tue May 27, 2014 | 9:04am EDT",UPDATE 2-ICE lines up European investors to buy a third of Euronext,http://www.reuters.com//article/euronext-ipo-idUSL6N0OD1OR20140527?type=companyNews

All will be cash-settled except the 1 kg gold futures, which will be physically settled with delivery in Singapore.The new futures contracts will be launched on March 17, complementing ICE's existing  portfolio, which includes Brent crude, sugar, mini-gold, cotton and a soon-to-be-launched world cotton contract, ICE said. ICE acquired the Singapore Mercantile Exchange (SMX) this year for $150 million in a bid to gain a foothold in trading and clearing in Asia, adding to its network of markets and clearing houses in the United States, Canada, Brazil, Britain and continental Europe.In February ICE cancelled all contracts listed on SMX, which ranged from iron ore to pepper and metals and currencies, ahead of a planned relaunch. Asia has long been the fastest growing demand region for the raw materials that power economic growth, but has mostly priced the purchases against benchmarks like Brent crude and London Metal Exchange copper.""Through this base of operations in Asia, ICE plans to offer further global and regional products while expanding its network of exchanges and clearing houses,"" the exchange said. The five contracts will be cleared via ICE Clear Singapore.ICE's gold contract faces tough competition as Asia has already seen the launch of several contracts this year, with an eye on providing a viable price benchmark in the world's biggest gold-consuming region.CME Group Inc is expected to launch a 1 kg physically deliverable gold futures contract in Hong Kong later this year. The Singapore Exchange introduced a 25 kg contract earlier this year, while the Shanghai Gold Exchange launched three new physical gold contracts, with derivatives expected later.

16,"  NEW YORK Dec 16 Intercontinental Exchange Inc's  NYSE Group unit said on Tuesday it would eliminate the fees the exchange operator charges for certain retail stock orders in an effort to take back business from over-the-counter trading platforms.Stock exchanges have been losing market share for years now to private, bank-run trading venues that promote themselves as cheaper alternatives for matching buy and sell orders. Nearly 40 percent of all stock trades now take place away from exchanges, on private, broker-run trading platforms.Most stock orders sent to online retail brokerages, such as TD Ameritrade and Charles Schwab Corp, are sold to other brokerages like Citadel and KCG Holdings Inc , which match buy and sell orders and promise to try to get a better price than the one publicly posted by exchanges. These brokerages usually send the orders that they cannot match on to other bank-run trading platforms where fees are generally lower than on exchanges. NYSE now says it will eliminate transaction fees for orders originating from retail investors that are priced midway between the best bid and offer available at the time, priced at $1 or above, starting Jan. 2. NYSE currently charges 25 cents per 100 shares for those types of orders. ""Offering price improvement of the publicly displayed best bid and offer for retail orders at no charge is an example of an investor-oriented solution to enhance market quality,"" NYSE President Thomas Farley said in a statement. NYSE executes a little over 20 percent of U.S. stock trades on its three stock trading platforms, the New York Stock Exchange, NYSE Arca, and NYSE MKT. That is down from around 50 percent in 2005. Other exchange operators, including Nasdaq OMX Group, and BATS Global Markets, have also taken business from NYSE.

(on.wsj.com/13capyb)Banks, in exchange, would accept a rule known as ""trade at"" that would give more precedence to the stock exchanges, except for transactions involving large blocks of stock and retail investors, the Journal said. A trade-at rule would mandate that stock trades take place on exchanges unless private venues, such as dark pools, offered a significant price improvement. Credit Suisse Group AG, which operates the largest dark pool, has agreed to endorse the proposal, the Journal reported.

20,"   By John McCrank | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Intercontinental Exchange Inc (ICE.N) on Thursday reported higher-than-expected quarterly earnings as the exchange and clearing house operator further integrated its $11 billion purchase of NYSE Euronext from the year-earlier quarter. ICE said it earned $288 million in the fourth quarter, or $2.54 a share, compared with a loss of $176 million a share, or $1.83 a year earlier following the purchase of the New York Stock Exchange owner.Excluding one-time items such as acquisition costs, ICE earned $2.59 a share, up 30 percent from a year earlier and 5 cents above the average estimate by analysts, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The upside came from higher revenue and lower expenses than expected, UBS analyst Alex Kramm said in a note to clients.ICE began as an energy exchange in 2000 and expanded quickly through acquisitions, with its growth influencing the evolution of the derivatives market from open outcry pits to electronic trading centers. The Atlanta-based company bought NYSE to gain a foothold in the interest rate futures business through control of Liffe, Europe's No. 2 derivatives market. Following the acquisition, ICE spun off Euronext through an IPO. The company sold its remaining 6 percent stake in the European bourse operator for $119 million in the latest quarter. That, along with higher transaction and clearing fees, and market data and listings revenues, helped boost revenue at ICE by 49 percent to $800 million. Analysts had expected $785.3 million.There has been much recent speculation among industry insiders that ICE will soon offload the New York Stock Exchange, as the highly competitive U.S. stock trading business does not fit with the derivatives franchise ICE has built.  But ICE expects NYSE to generate strong earnings per share growth over the next two years, mainly through listings and data services, and the company's stakeholders want to share in those gains, ICE's Chief Executive Jeffrey Sprecher said on a call with analysts. When the promise of increased profits wanes, ICE will consider its options.    ""If that business is a drag on us and we can't use it to grow earnings, then it's completely insignificant, and unlike a lot of people in the exchange space, you have seen us shed businesses,"" Sprecher said.  For this year, ICE said it expects combined data services and listings revenue growth of around $100 million, excluding acquisitions. Shares of ICE were up 4.3 percent at $224.25 on Thursday morning.

22,"  April 2 Intercontinental Exchange Inc's  NYSE Arca said on Thursday that it ""inadvertently"" sent out regulatory halts in around 160 exchange-traded funds and notes on Tuesday after a glitch interrupted trading on the electronic trading platform.The error meant that investors were unable to buy or sell some of the most heavily-traded U.S. ETFs and ETNs on any exchange for a little over nine minutes on Tuesday. Some of the securities experienced multiple further halts following the initial stoppage due to large price swings that left some investors buying securities at higher prices than they otherwise may have.ETFs have exploded in popularity over the past decade, making up 25-30 percent of all trading on U.S. exchanges in recent years, according to a recent Credit Suisse report. NYSE Arca said the issues, which began at 10:05 a.m. EDT were cleared up by 12:19 p.m. ""During this time frame, NYSE Arca inadvertently sent out regulatory halts"" in the affected securities, the exchange said in a notice to traders on Thursday. The problems started with a downed Arca server that generates electronic trading prices for exchange-traded products with ticker symbols from UTG to ZSML. That range includes some of the most heavily traded ETFs, such as the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund, XLF; the Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF, VWO; as well as the Barclays Bank iPath S&P 500 VIX Short Term Futures ETN, VXX.When a regulatory halt is imposed on a security by the exchange where it is listed, all other U.S. markets that also trade the security must honor the halt. When a non-regulatory halt is called, however, other exchanges may still be able to continue trading.

28,"   By John McCrank | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Jeffrey Sprecher has defined his career by buying up rivals of Intercontinental Exchange Inc, the company he founded as an upstart in 2000. Now he is at it again.    This week, ICE said it was eyeing a bid for LSE-Group, potentially thwarting an offer for the London Stock Exchange owner by Germany-based Deutsche Boerse. The move would be one of a string of blockbuster deals for ICE, including a $8.2 billion acquisition of the bastion of American capitalism - the New York Stock Exchange - in 2012. ICE had gone public on the NYSE in 2005.""He's been a visionary in the exchange world and a consummate deal maker,"" said Rich Repetto, an analyst at Sandler O'Neill.    Sprecher, a Wisconsin-born chemical engineer by training, founded ICE in 2000 in Atlanta, Georgia, with the goal of modernizing energy trading through technology.    The former president of Atlanta's Continental Power Exchange persuaded seven big banks and energy firms including Goldman Sachs (GS.N), Morgan Stanley (MS.N), BP (BP.L) and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) to back him in a challenge to energy giant Enron's stranglehold on the electricity market.    When Enron collapsed in 2001, ICE was deluged with orders. That same year, Sprecher led a takeover of London's International Petroleum Exchange, giving ICE a European foothold in the futures market where it would grow into a dominant force. Sprecher, now 61, and his small team of top managers chose technology over tradition and as they pushed onward, showed little deference to tradition as they closed down historic trading pits.     In 2007, ICE bought the New York Board of Trade and attempted to buy the No. 2 U.S. futures exchanges, CBOT Holdings, for $9.9 billion - nearly disrupting a bid by the top futures market, CME Group - which had to counter its offer.     The move attracted a lot of attention, especially with ICE executives slipping copies of the offer letter under the hotel doors of Charlie Carey, CBOT's chairman, and Bernie Dan, its CEO, at an industry conference in Boca Raton.     Whether Sprecher tables a bid for the LSE or not, the acknowledgement that he is considering it pushed LSE’s shares to a record high on Tuesday, potentially raising the stakes for Deutsche Boerse, which is talking to the LSE about an all-share merger.    ICE declined to comment.         POWERHOUSE            A raft of acquisitions in quick succession cemented Sprecher's deal making acumen and ICE as a global powerhouse in futures, equities, swaps, clearing houses and financial data.    When ICE bought NYSE, it was not its first attempt. After Deutsche Boerse and NYSE agreed to merge in early 2011, Sprecher teamed up with Nasdaq Inc's (NDAQ.O) Bob Greifeld to propose a counter offer.     While there was never a formal offer, the overture threatened Deutsche Boerse's plans and forced it to raise its bid. But both deals were eventually opposed by regulators, which said a Deutsche Boerse-NYSE marriage would have created a near-monopoly in European futures, while a Nasdaq-NYSE tie-up would have created a U.S. listings monolith. But that did not stop ICE from making a successful solo takeover months later.     Now ICE threatens to crush Deutsche Boerse's LSE romance.    Regulation has generally worked in ICE's favor. Following a short race car-driving career in the '80s, Sprecher spent nearly two decades building power plants at a time of deregulation in the electric industry.     When he started ICE, he could see that transparency and efficiency were sorely needed in the industry and along with moving to electronic trading, created standardized products that could be easily traded. As regulators began to talk about requiring more derivatives trades to be carried out on exchanges rather than in private deals, ICE began acquiring clearing houses.       In December, ICE spent $5.2 billion on data provider Interactive Data Corp and $650 million for energy broker Trayport.      ATLANTA POWER COUPLE     Sprecher’s wife, Kelly Loeffler, heads corporate communications and investor relations at ICE. The duo keep a low profile in New York, but are one of Atlanta’s top power couples.     Sprecher, who as of Feb. 24, owned $319 million worth of ICE stock, according to Thomson Reuters data, is said to look at any possibly deal.        In January, he and Loeffler were reported to have mulled a bid for the Atlanta Hawks NBA basket ball team, along with John Brock, CEO of Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc CCE.N, and his wife. Loeffler and Mary Brock already co-own the Atlanta Dream WNBA team.    Loeffler considered entering the 2014 race for the U.S. Senate, but decided against it because she too busy finalizing the NYSE deal.    The couple contributed a total of $1,710,100 to the 2012 election cycle, with most of the donations going to a super PAC supporting Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, according the website OpenSecrets.org. In 2014, the couple hosted a $25,000-a-head fundraiser with Romney and the chairman of the Republican National Committee at their Atlanta mansion. Loeffler declined to comment on whether the couple will support any candidates in the current presidential race.

44,"  Aug 18 Financial and commodity markets operator Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) said on Thursday that British competition authorities' concerns about its $650 million takeover of Trayport were not justified.The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said on Tuesday that ICE should consider reversing its takeover of commodities trading software house Trayport as a merger could substantially reduce competition in European energy trading markets.Atlanta-based ICE beat arch-rival CME Group to buy London-based Trayport last December but the CMA launched an in-depth investigation in May due to its concerns about the impact on competition.ICE, in a statement on Thursday, said that CMA's findings were provisional and the watchdog is not expected to make a final decision on the takeover until mid-October. It said it would address the watchdog's concerns and demonstrate that they do not reflect how Trayport will operate as a subsidiary of ICE. ""We do not believe that divestment is necessary, appropriate or in the best interests of Trayport's customers,"" ICE said. The CMA in its report said it was concerned that ICE could use its ownership of Trayport's platform to reduce competition between ICE and its rivals and that reduced competition could lead to increased fees for execution and clearing.ICE said Trayport would operate as a separate independent business after the takeover. ""Trayport will continue to operate as it does today in European utilities markets and will ensure that brokers, exchanges and clearing houses are all treated fairly and reasonably and are not discriminated against, including with respect to pricing, access and support,"" the exchange said in its statement.(Reporting by Rahul B in Bengaluru; Editing by Susan Fenton)",2016-08-18,ICE,"Thu Aug 18, 2016 | 6:05am EDT",ICE says British watchdog's concerns about Trayport takeover not justified,http://www.reuters.com//article/ice-trayport-competition-idUSL8N1AZ267?type=companyNews

59,"   By Florence Tan | SINGAPORE  SINGAPORE Intercontinental Exchange Inc has proposed limiting the size of positions investors can hold next year when trading Dubai futures, a document issued by the exchange to its members showed.The proposed measure is aimed at securing the reliability of the contract, as trade volumes and open interest for the Asian crude oil benchmark have grown since 2012, ICE said in the circular. The proposal comes more than a year after trade volumes hit an all-time high in August last year and whipsawed Asia's crude oil market, leading to calls for more regulatory oversight in the sector.     ""This will likely curb speculative behavior. (Trading) profits are not made on the Platts window but in swaps (paper positions),"" a Singapore-based trader said, referring to oil pricing agency Platts' Market-on-Close process, in which physical oil trades contribute to its price assessments. ICE has proposed a position limit of 6,000 lots, or 6 million barrels of oil, that will apply from the first to the final trading day of the expiry month.Market participants can apply to ICE for exemption from the limit if they have a commercial rationale to hold a larger position.The measure is expected to affect companies who take large positions in the market, and they may circumvent the limit by using other clearing platforms such as CME's ClearPort or conducting bilateral trades, trade sources said.  But it could also encourage more trading of ICE's Brent futures and DME's Oman contract, said a second Singapore-based trader.Members are expected to submit feedback by Nov. 30 and a decision will be made by Jan. 3, ICE said. The position limit could apply to contracts from May 2017 delivery onward, it said. ICE did not respond to an email from Reuters seeking comment.Traders of the global oil price marker ICE Brent futures have a position limit of 6,000 contracts in the last five business days of a trading month, according to the exchange's website.

64,"  NEW YORK Intercontinental Exchange Inc (ICE.N) generally takes too long to complete investigations into questionable trading practices on its U.S. futures exchange as required by the rules, the regulator said.Overall, ICE Futures U.S. has an adequate trade practice surveillance program, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission said in a report dated Dec. 2. The regulator also recommended ICE do a better job documenting its reviews.     Regulations require that exchanges conduct investigations within a year or less, unless there are mitigating factors. The 61 trade practice-related cases ICE closed during a one-year review by the CFTC's Division of Market Oversight, from March 1, 2014 to Feb. 28, 2015, remained open for an average of 461 days, the report said. Of those cases, 28 were open for more than a year, including 12 that remained open for at least two years. Of the 28, 10 did not have sufficient mitigating circumstances to justify the length of time it took to investigate them, the report said. Representatives of ICE could not immediately be reached for comment on the report.Exchanges monitor their dealings for manipulative or disruptive trading practices, such as spoofing, to protect investors and inspire confidence in the markets.Spoofing is when one or more traders move the price of a security by placing bogus orders that are modified or canceled before they can become actual trades. The trader can then take the other side of the trades at better prices. During the review period, ICE initiated four potential spoofing cases and closed two potential spoofing cases, the regulator said.The CFTC said there was a lack of documentation related to trade practice reviews that ICE said it had done and that it was not able to confirm that all trade practice reviews were conducted during the period. ICE was also unable to replicate the parameters used to generate alerts for trade practice review exception reports.The CFTC recommended that ICE improve its documentation of reviews. It also asked the exchange to retain the parameters used to generate alerts that initiate reviews, and to expand the scope of its investigations to look for more patterns of abuse, such as by reviewing more trading days.
