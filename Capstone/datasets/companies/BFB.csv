0,"   By Dominique Vidalon | PARIS  PARIS Shares in Remy Cointreau (RCOP.PA) surged on Friday on speculation that Brown-Forman (BFb.N), the U.S. maker of Jack Daniel's whiskey, was eyeing the French cognac producer, though prospects of a near-term deal looked slim.Many drinks groups could afford to buy Remy Cointreau, which has a stock market valuation of 2.9 billion euros ($4.0 billion) against $19 billion for Brown-Forman and is seen as vulnerable at the moment as it grapples with falling sales due to slowing demand in China.""Remy is definitely being peddled about as there is an opportunity now, it's down on its knees. The timing is right although I still think it's overvalued. I don't think the problems in China are over, it's not hit bottom yet,"" a banker said.Remy shares have lost 18 percent since November when the maker of Louis XIII luxury cognac issued a profit warning due to weak demand in China. In January its chief executive quit and it is still searching for a permanent replacement.Like rivals Diageo (DGE.L) and Pernod Ricard (PERP.PA), Remy has been hit by a government crackdown on luxury gift-giving and personal spending by civil servants in China, as well as by slowing economic growth in the world's second-biggest economy.Cognac makes up 80 percent of Remy's operating profit and China half of that total.Remy Cointreau shares rose as much as 10 percent early on Friday before trimming gains to trade up 4.5 percent by 1330GMT. Traders cited an article on the British financial blog ""Betaville"" as the source of the speculation. Remy Cointreau declined comment. Brown-Forman officials were not immediately available outside business hours in the U.S.""The idea is that Brown-Forman is desperate to get hold of Remy Cointreau because it doesn't want to get left behind in the global consolidation game that re-ignited at the beginning of the year when Japan's Suntory snapped up U.S. bourbon specialist Beam BEAM.N for $16 billion,"" the blog said.Tentative discussions had been held between investment banking advisers to both companies, with Lazard said to be representing Remy Cointreau and its controlling shareholders.There were however no formal discussions taking place between the companies, the blog added.""In this industry everybody talks to everybody. It would not be surprising if bankers talked to bankers but it may be all very preliminary,"" said Bernstein analyst Trevor Stirling. Another banker said that banks were trying to persuade Remy to sell ""but there are no signs that they're sellers"".A GOOD MATCH Remy was also likely to attract interest from the likes of Japan's Suntory and privately-held Bacardi, the second banker said.Industry bankers and analysts said Remy and Brown-Forman would be a good match, since they are both family-controlled, both derive a significant proportion of their profit from a single, brown spirits brand, and they complement each other geographically.Brown-Forman, based in Louisville, Kentucky is best known for its Jack Daniel's Tennessee whiskey, which accounts for about half its revenue, but has smaller brands including Southern Comfort and Herradura tequila. It is itself often seen as a target for the likes of Diageo, Pernod Ricard or Bacardi.In its latest quarter Brown-Forman reported strong sales growth in China despite the anti-extravagance campaign. Analysts said this was partly due to Jack Daniel's being a ""premium"" brand rather than an ""ultra luxury"" brand like Louis XIII.It was unclear if the Herard Dubreuil family, which controls over 60 percent of Remy's voting rights, would be a seller.""The family would be a reluctant seller but if the price was right that could change. At the moment they are 100 percent focused on the cognac recovery,"" said Bernstein's Stirling.Societe Generale analysts said in a note on Friday that given the attractiveness of Remy's portfolio, which includes century-old cognac eaux de vie inventories, a deal could fetch multiple of 22 times estimated 2014 EBITDA, or 85 euros per share, topping the 20 times of the Suntory/Beam deal.A very complicated shareholding structure with different family members holding different stakes may also be a hurdle to a deal with some family members likely to want cash.Societe Generale analysts said it was likely a future deal would be a combination of cash and shares.($1 = 0.7291 Euros)(Reporting by Alistair Smout, Dominique Vidalon, Martinne Geller, Anjuli Davies; Editing by Catherine Evans and John Stonestreet)",2014-04-04,BFB,"Fri Apr 4, 2014 | 8:59am EDT",Remy Cointreau shares soar on talk of Brown-Forman interest,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-shares-in-remy-cointreau-idUSBREA330C820140404?type=companyNews

5,"  * Jamaica's anti-doping process questioned* Errors made in Campbell-Brown's case, CAS says* WADA confident mistakes will not be repeated* Jamaican officials say changes have been made   (Adds WADA, Jamaican comments)April 15 The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) blasted Jamaican anti-doping officials on Tuesday for the mishandling of a drug test by sprinter Veronica Campbell-Brown that led to a successful appeal of the three-time Olympic gold medallist's two year ban.In a scathing 58-page report explaining the decision to uphold Campbell-Brown's appeal, a CAS panel cited errors in the collection and handling of the sprinter's urine sample last year that could have resulted in its contamination, calling into question the entire Jamaican anti-doping operation.""In this case, the evidence before the panel establishes that the JAAA (Jamaica Athletic Administrative Association) has persistently failed to comply with the mandatory partial testing,"" said CAS.""That systematic and knowing failure, for which no reasonable explanation has been advanced, is deplorable and gives rise to the most serious concerns about the overall integrity of the JAAA's anti-doping processes, as exemplified in this case by the flaws in JADCO's (Jamaica Anti-Doping Commission) sample collection and its documentation.""The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), while concurring mistakes were made in Campbell-Brown's case that were fundamental to the integrity of the testing process, said it was confident the errors would not be repeated.""WADA responded to past concerns in Jamaica by initiating a partnership with the Canadian Centre for Ethics in Sport (CCES) to mentor and assist JADCO in developing their anti-doping programs,"" the global agency said in a statement to Reuters.""As a result, WADA is confident that such mistakes will not be repeated again.""CHANGES MADE  Jamaica's anti-doping efforts underwent a major overhaul in late 2013, a year in which eight Jamaicans failed doping tests.The entire JADCO board resigned and a new executive director was appointed and Jamaican athletics federation president Warren Blake said on Tuesday the problems were now in the past.""This speaks to the situation that existed last year and the question was the use of partial sample kits,"" Blake told Reuters. ""My understanding is that JADCO does in fact have partial sample kits now....so there's really not a problem.""He also questioned why the Jamaica Athletic Administrative Association was mentioned in the report when the testing was done by JADCO.Noted coach Stephen Francis, whose athletes once included Asafa Powell and Sherone Simpson, recently called for Jamaican officials to disband their anti-doping agency and contract testing to agencies in other countries.But Blake and Natalie Neita-Headley, the Jamaican minister responsible for sports, disagreed. ""Absolutely not,"" Neita-Headley told Reuters. ""With a sporting programme like ours, with the success we have attained; we need to have a anti-doping commission that works and that's what we are working at.""Said Blake: ""Many things have changed with JADCO and I'm not going to be supporting taking our testing out of our country and giving it to strangers, certainly not.""But doping concerns in the world's top sprinting nation resurfaced last week when former 100 metres world record holder Powell and Simpson were banned for 18 months by a Jamaican panel after they tested positive for a banned stimulant in 2013.Both have appealed their suspensions to CAS.Olympic discus thrower Allison Randall, was also handed a two-year ban for using the prohibited diuretic hydrochlorothiazide. APPEALS DECISION Campbell-Brown also returned a positive test for hydrochlorothiazide at the Jamaica International Invitational meeting in Kingston on May 4 and in October was given a public reprimand by a JAAA disciplinary panel.But after a doping review board of the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) recommended a two-year doping ban, the Jamaican panel put the suspension in place in February.Campbell-Brown appealed the ban, her lawyers arguing that international standards were violated during her sample collection, thus compromising the integrity of the samples.The three member CAS panel agreed that serious errors were made in the collection process noting that Campbell-Brown took her partial sample with her in a covered, but unsealed, collection vessel and went to the waiting room where several other athletes were present.It was noted that Campbell-Brown placed the sample on the floor while she went to collect more water and did various exercises in an effort to produce more urine.CAS said the errors left open the possibility of Campbell-Brown's sample being contaminated by water or sweat through the spout of the collection bottle.""In this case, the evidence before the panel establishes that the JAAA has persistently failed to comply with the mandatory partial testing,"" summed up the CAS report.""The panel notes the contradictory explanations provided by the JADCO witnesses to the JAAA Disciplinary Panel in September 2013, which cause further concern about the reliability of the evidence adduced against the athlete.""The panel's assessment of the athlete's testimony fortifies its conclusion that the evidence is insufficient to establish a doping violation to the requisite standard of proof.""The panel concludes that the athlete's appeal should be allowed on the ground that the panel is not comfortably satisfied that the athlete committed the charged anti-doping violation.""

12,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, January 15 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has downgraded the long-term ratings  of Brown-Forman Corporation (Brown-Forman) to 'A' from 'A+'. The Rating Outlook  is Stable. A full list of ratings follows at the end of this release.  Brown-Forman announced yesterday that it has reached an agreement to sell its  Southern Comfort and Tuaca trademarks to Sazerac for $544 million. The sale of  these brands is expected to close by March 1, 2016 and is subject to regulatory  clearance in the U.S. and customary closing conditions. Fitch expects proceeds  to be deployed towards share buybacks or special dividends absent any  acquisition opportunity. Fitch views acquisition opportunities as limited given  the scarcity of available brands that fits Brown Forman's portfolio strategy. If  the company did make an acquisition, the high multiple required for an  above-premium brand would not contribute a material level of EBITDA. KEY RATING DRIVERS Credit Profile Eroded  The ratings downgrade reflects the erosion to Brown-Forman's credit profile,  with leverage (debt to EBITDA) expected to be sustained over 1.6x or on a FFO  basis, FFO adjusted leverage above 2.5x. This compares to debt/EBITDA in the  1.0-1.1x range during the last few years. The increased leverage reflects i) the  $1 billion debt-financed share repurchase program that Brown-Forman announced in  early 2015 ii) the divestiture of Southern Comfort, and Tuaca which generated a  material level of EBITDA and iii) Fitch's expectations that the proceeds from  the divestiture will be deployed towards share buybacks or special dividends.  Fitch does view the portfolio pruning positively as it allows Brown-Forman  management to focus resources on its highest strategic priorities of its premium  and above-premium liquor brands. Southern Comfort has been in a moderate  structural decline the past several years due primarily to pressure from  flavored whiskeys and continued weakness in the on-premise channel.  Strong Anchor Brand, Favorable Demand Trends Brown-Forman's ratings are supported by the sizeable operating earnings and  consistent cash flow generation that is derived from the strong and competitive  brand portfolio of one of the largest worldwide spirits companies. Major  contributors to Brown-Forman's operating earnings are its Jack Daniel's  franchise, which is the fourth-largest premium spirits brand and the largest  selling American whiskey brand in the world including its highly successful line  extensions, Tennessee Honey and Tennessee Fire. The Jack Daniel's family represents on an annual basis approximately half of the  depletions of the company's major brands. Brown-Forman's other major brands,  Finlandia Vodka, Canadian Mist and El Jimador Tequila have experienced further  volume pressure during FY2016. The El Jimador brand family declined in Mexico as  the company continues brand repositioning at a more premium price point through  multi-year price increases. Brown-Forman's spirits portfolio primarily competes in the premium and super  premium categories and skews toward American whiskeys. Fitch views this as a  competitive strength, because the aging process and inventory investments  required are a barrier to entry providing an impediment particularly for value  competition. Brown-Forman spirits have taken share from beer and clear spirits  with the favorable demand trends driven by flavored and higher-end American  whiskey. As such, Brown-Forman has experienced strong category momentum for Jack Daniel's  Tennessee Honey and the higher-priced Woodford Reserve family with depletion  volume growth at 12% and 26% respectively during the first half of fiscal 2016.  The Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire line extension experienced underlying net sales  growth of 30% through the same time period. Industry demand trends should remain  strong for the foreseeable future that when coupled with Brown-Forman's  portfolio would allow the company to grow at above average rates for the next  several years.  Operating Performance In-line with Expectations Sales, net of excise taxes, decreased 3% to $2.06 billion for the first half of  FY2016 ended Oct. 31, 2015. Sales growth on an underlying basis was 6% with  growth in volume of 3%, price/mix of 3%, and foreign exchange impact of 8%.  Growth in the U.S. and Europe, which represents approximately 74% of net sales,  was 7% and 6% respectively on an underlying basis. Fitch expects underlying  revenue growth of approximately 6% in FY2016 and FY2017 and foreign currency  pressure of 8% and 4% in FY2016 and FY2017 respectively.  Operating income increased by only 1% to $529 million for the first half of  2016, pressured by foreign currency of 4% and change in distributor inventories  by 3%. Underlying operating income continues to benefit from positive volume and  price/mix growing by 9% during the first half of 2016. EBITDA margins for the  LTM period ended Oct. 31, 2015 were 35.8% negatively affected by higher wood  prices during the second-half of fiscal 2015. Currency headwinds in the  high-single-digits are expected to impact the full year results for fiscal year  2016. Fitch expects currency headwinds will continue to weigh on the results in  FY2017, although to a lesser extent than in FY2016. Fitch expects EBITDA growth  to be flat in both FY2016, due to currency, and FY2017 due primarily to the  brand divestitures offset by improvements in gross profit margin, a decline in  SGA expense and organic growth in the rest of the portfolio. M&A Bolt-on Focused Brown-Forman purchased all of the shares of Slane Castle Irish Whiskey in June  2015 and announced plans to invest $50 million to build a new distillery,  construct warehouses, and develop a consumer experience at Slane Castle Estate  in Ireland. Given the current momentum behind Irish whiskey, Fitch believes this  transaction aligns closely with the company's acquisition strategy to acquire  brands opportunistically with growth potential that are complementary to  Brown-Forman's current portfolio.  DEBT STRUCTURE AND LIQUIDITY Solid Liquidity Underpins Profile Brown-Forman's cash balances, stable FCF generation and substantial credit  facility capacity provides good liquidity. As of Oct. 31, 2015, Brown-Forman had  $195 million of cash with $140 million offshore. FCF for the past 12 months was  $310 million. FCF is expected to be at least $250 million annually for the next  three years due to organic growth in the mid-single digit range, expected  decreases in capital spending offset by the loss in cash flow from the Southern  Comfort brand. The company has not drawn on its $800 million five-year credit facility that  matures in November 2018, which can be expanded by $400 million. The credit  facility is primarily used to support the company's $1 billion commercial paper  program. Commercial paper borrowings were $295 million for the quarter ended  Oct. 31, 2015, which leaves available capacity on the credit facility of $505  million. The credit facility includes an interest coverage financial maintenance  covenant of 3.0x. Brown-Forman maintains a very manageable maturity profile with approximately  $250 million coming due in 2016 and $250 million in 2018. Fitch expects the 2016  maturity will be refinanced. In March 2015, Brown-Forman authorized a new stock repurchase program of up to  $1 billion that is available through March 24, 2016. Share repurchases totalled  $744 million for the six months ended Oct. 31, 2015. Fitch expects Brown-Forman  to fully complete the share repurchase program. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Additional key assumptions within Fitch's rating case for the issuer include: --Underlying revenue growth of approximately 6% in FY2016 and FY2017 and foreign  currency pressure of 8% and 4% in FY2016 and FY2017 respectively. --EBITDA growth to be flat in both FY2016, due to currency, and FY2017 due  primarily to the brand divestitures offset by improvements in gross profit  margin, a decline in SGA expense and organic growth in the rest of the  portfolio. --EBITDA margin in the 36-37% range over the forecast period. --FCF margin (absent any special dividends) in the 8-9% range over the forecast  horizon. --Share repurchases pacing with FCF over the course of the forecast. --Proceeds of further asset divestitures deployed towards share buybacks.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a positive  rating action include:  Positive rating actions are not anticipated in the intermediate term but could  occur on continued strong operating performance driven by the Jack Daniel's  Brand Family combined with: --Decreased leverage such that total debt-to-operating EBITDA below 1.5x;  --FFO adjusted leverage in the low 2.0x on a sustained basis. Any potential ratings upgrade however would be limited given Brown-Forman's  dependence on the Jack Daniel's franchise. Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a negative  rating action include:  --Total Debt to EBITDA above 2.0x --FFO adjusted leverage sustained at or above 3.0x; --FCF margin sustained below 5%; --A material leveraging transaction; --A significant and sustained loss of market share for the Jack Daniel's brand. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has downgraded the following Brown-Forman ratings: --Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to 'A' from 'A+'; --Senior unsecured notes to 'A' from 'A+'; --Bank credit facility to 'A' from 'A+'. Fitch has affirmed the following short-term Brown-Forman ratings: --Short-term IDR at 'F1'; --Commercial paper at 'F1'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.

13,"  LONDON, April 27 Jack Daniel's owner Brown-Forman Corp is getting back into the Scotch whisky business after an 11-year absence with the 285 million pound ($415.42 million) purchase of the BenRiach Distillery.The deal, announced on Wednesday, will add the GlenDronach, BenRiach, and Glenglassaugh single-malt Scotch whiskies to a portfolio that already includes the American whiskey brands Woodford Reserve and Early Times in addition the flagship Jack Daniel's.Brown-Forman, based in Louisville, Kentucky, used to sell the Glenmorangie single-malt whisky in various markets, and was a minority shareholder in the brand. It sold its interest when Moet Hennessy bought Glenmorangie in 2005. Brown-Forman in January agreed to sell its Southern Comfort and Tuaca brands to Sazerac for $543.5 million, to focus on its core whiskey business.

15,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, April 28 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Brown-Forman Corporation's  (Brown-Forman) ratings at 'A'/'F1' and revised the Outlook to Negative from  Stable on the announcement of Brown-Forman's acquisition of The BenRiach  Distillery Company Limited for approximately BP285 million or approximately $400  million.  Fitch views the acquisition of the BenRiach Distillery Company as highly  complementary and fills a gap in Brown-Forman's aged spirits portfolio by adding  super-premium Scotch whisky brands to the company's existing  premium-to-super-premium whiskey portfolio. Additionally, the new brands will  replace a portion of the cash flow associated with the divestiture of Southern  Comfort and Tuaca with more margin accretive cash flows. Over the long term,  Fitch expects good growth potential for these Scotch whisky brands, as  Brown-Forman invests behind the brands and leverages its global distribution  network. The Outlook revision to Negative reflects the continued erosion of  Brown-Forman's credit profile driven primarily by an aggressive financial policy  towards debt-funded share repurchases and expectations that Brown-Forman will  fully complete its $1 billion share repurchase program in fiscal 2017 combined  with the increased debt associated with the acquisition of The BenRiach  Distillery Company. As a result, Fitch believes leverage will increase to 1.6x  for FY2016 and approximately 2.1x in FY2017 before moderating in FY2018 to  slightly less than 2x due to growth in EBITDA. This compares to debt/EBITDA in  the 1x-1.1x range during the last few years.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Strong Anchor Brand, Favorable Demand Trends Brown-Forman's ratings are supported by the sizeable operating earnings and  consistent cash flow generation that is derived from the strong and competitive  brand portfolio of one of the largest worldwide spirits companies. Major  contributors to Brown-Forman's operating earnings are its Jack Daniel's  franchise, which is the fourth-largest premium spirits brand and the largest  selling American whiskey brand in the world including its highly successful line  extensions, Tennessee Honey and Tennessee Fire. The Jack Daniel's family represents on an annual basis approximately half of the  depletions of the company's major brands. Brown-Forman's other major brands,  Finlandia Vodka, Canadian Mist and El Jimador Tequila have experienced further  volume pressure during FY2016. The El Jimador brand family declined in Mexico as  the company continues brand repositioning at a more premium price point through  multi-year price increases. Brown-Forman's spirits portfolio primarily competes in the premium and super  premium categories and skews toward American whiskeys. Fitch views this as a  competitive strength, because the aging process and inventory investments  required are a barrier to entry providing an impediment particularly for value  competition. Brown-Forman spirits have taken share from beer and clear spirits,  with the favorable demand trends driven by flavored and higher-end American  whiskey. As such, Brown-Forman has experienced strong category momentum for Jack Daniel's  Tennessee Honey and the higher-priced Woodford Reserve family with depletion  volume growth at 10% and 27%, respectively, during the first nine months of  fiscal 2016 (ended Jan. 31, 2016). The Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire line  extension experienced strong underlying net sales growth, contributing over 1%  of overall underlying sales growth during the same time period. Industry demand  trends should remain strong for the foreseeable future which, when coupled with  Brown-Forman's portfolio, would allow the company to grow at above-average rates  for the next several years. Operating Performance In-line with Expectations Sales, net of excise taxes, decreased 2% to $3.15 billion for the first nine  months of FY2016. Sales growth on an underlying basis was 5% with growth in  volume of 1%, price/mix of 4%, and foreign exchange impact of 8%. Growth in the  U.S. and Europe, which represents over 70% of net sales, was 7% and 5%,  respectively, on an underlying basis. Fitch expects underlying revenue growth of  approximately 5%-6% in FY2016 and FY2017 and foreign currency pressure of 7% and  4% in FY2016 and FY2017.  Operating income increased 2% to $807 million for the first nine months of  FY2016, pressured by foreign currency of 5%. Underlying operating income  continues to benefit from positive volume and price/mix, growing by 7% during  the same period. Currency headwinds in the high single digits are expected to  impact the full-year results for FY 2016. Fitch expects currency headwinds will  continue to weigh on the results in FY2017, although to a lesser extent than in  FY2016. Fitch expects EBITDA growth to be up 1% in FY2016 and up approximately  3% in FY2017 due primarily to the brand portfolio restructurings, improvements  in gross profit margin, a decline in SG&A expense and organic growth in the rest  of the portfolio. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for Brown-Forman in 2016 include: --Net revenue down 1% in FY2016, flat-to-slightly negative in FY2017, and  growing low-to-mid-single digits in FY2018. Underlying revenue growth is  expected in the 55-6% range over the forecast period. --EBITDA margins increasing in FY2017 to approximately 37.5%, and 40bps in  FY2018 driven by improved gross margins on the brands in the portfolio. --Capital expenditures of $130 million in FY2016, growing to over $200 million  in FY2017 to support additional capex related to the BenRiach acquisition and  distillery buildout for Slane Castle. --Free cash flow (FCF) margins growing from 4.5% in FY2016 to approximately 6.5%  in FY2017 with margins in the high single digits in FY2018 as capital spending  declines. --Total Debt/EBITDA of 1.6x in FY2016 increasing to approximately 2.1x in FY2017  assuming Brown-Forman completes its $1 billion share authorization. Leverage  moderates to less than 2x as a result of EBITDA growth in FY2018 and beyond.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a positive  rating action include:  Positive rating actions are not anticipated in the intermediate term given the  expected increase in leverage and the Negative Outlook. Over the longer term, a  positive rating action would be based on continued strong operating performance  driven by the Jack Daniel's Brand Family combined with: --Decreased leverage such that total debt-to-operating EBITDA is below 1.5x;  --FFO adjusted leverage in the low 2x range on a sustained basis. Any potential ratings upgrade however would be limited given Brown-Forman's  dependence on the Jack Daniel's franchise. Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a negative  rating action include:  --Total Debt-to-EBITDA sustained above 2x; --FFO adjusted leverage sustained above 3x; --FCF margin sustained below 5%; --A material leveraging transaction; --Further aggressive shareholder-based initiatives; --A significant and sustained loss of market share for the Jack Daniel's brand. LIQUIDITY Brown-Forman's cash balances, stable FCF generation and substantial credit  facility capacity provides good liquidity. As of Jan. 31, 2016, Brown-Forman had  $317 million of cash. FCF for the past 12 months was $299 million. FCF is  expected to be at least $140 million in FY2016, improving to $200 million-$300  million annually in FY2017 and beyond as organic growth in the mid-single-digit  range and expected decreases in capital spending offset the loss in cash flow  from the Southern Comfort brand. Fitch expects Brown-Forman will fund a portion  of the acquisition with offshore cash proceeds from the Southern Comfort  divestiture and should provide Brown-Forman an opportunity to access future  foreign-generated cash. The company has not drawn on its $800 million five-year credit facility that  matures in November 2018, which can be expanded by $400 million. The credit  facility is primarily used to support the company's $1 billion commercial paper  (CP) program. CP borrowings were $506 million for the quarter ended Jan. 31,  2016, which leaves available capacity of $294 million. The credit facility  includes an interest-coverage financial maintenance covenant of 3x. Brown-Forman  maintains a very manageable maturity profile with $250 million coming due in  2018.  Fitch affirms the following ratings: --Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A'; --Short-Term IDR at 'F1'; --Commercial paper at 'F1'; --Senior unsecured notes at 'A'; --Bank credit facility at 'A'.

18,"  NEW YORK Shares of Brown-Forman (BFb.N), which makes Jack Daniel's and other liquors, are seen as pricey as the world's top bourbon seller faces slowing growth in an increasingly crowded field, Barron's said in its latest online edition.Brown-Forman's stock had delivered annual gain of 12.5 percent in the past decade including dividend, outpacing the Standard & Poor's 500 index .SPX by 5 percent points, the financial weekly paper said.The company's flavored whiskeys for cocktails, and small-batch labels which are extremely profitable have boosted its growth. They also helped raise its shares' forward earnings estimates' at 27 times, compared with a 10-year average of 21 times. A strong dollar has hurt the revenue of the Louisville, Kentucky-based company in the first nine months of the year, which fell 2 percent. After adjusting for currency moves, it rose 5 percent, Barron's said. ""A lot of things have to go right in order for shares to outperform over the next year. Only one or two must go wrong for them to fall 10 percent or more,"" it said.Barron's said it has become harder to catch the attention of consumers with new whiskey flavors.  Back in 2010, there were over 40 flavored whiskeys. Now there are some 450, the paper said.""If revenue gains continue to slow, shares could lose some of their growth premium. Perhaps they carry a smidgen too much of a safety premium, too,"" it said. On Friday, Brown-Forman's stock closed up 1.5 percent at $98.36.

22,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, June 30 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A' rating to  Brown-Forman Corporation's (Brown-Forman) multi-tranche offering including  EUR300 million 10-year senior notes and GBP300 million 12-year senior notes. The  Rating Outlook is Negative. Brown-Forman intends to use the net proceeds of the multi-tranche offering for  general corporate purposes and to repay commercial paper indebtedness, a portion  of which was incurred in connection with the June 2016 acquisition of The  BenRiach Distillery Company Limited (BenRiach). KEY RATING DRIVERS Credit Profile Erosion The Negative Outlook reflects the continued erosion of Brown-Forman's credit  profile driven primarily by an aggressive financial policy toward debt-funded  share repurchases and expectations that Brown-Forman will fully complete its $1  billion share repurchase program in fiscal 2017, combined with the increased  debt associated with the acquisition of BenRiach. Fitch views the acquisition as  highly complementary and fills a gap in Brown-Forman's aged spirits portfolio.  As a result, Fitch believes leverage will increase to approximately 2.1x in  FY2017 before moderating in FY2018 to slightly less than 2x due to growth in  EBITDA. This compares to debt/EBITDA of 1.6x for FY2016.  Strong Anchor Brand, Favorable Demand Trends Brown-Forman's ratings are supported by the sizeable operating earnings and  consistent cash flow generation that is derived from the strong and competitive  brand portfolio of one of the largest worldwide spirits companies. Major  contributors to Brown-Forman's operating earnings are its Jack Daniel's  franchise, which is the fourth-largest premium spirits brand and the largest  selling American whiskey brand in the world including its highly successful line  extensions, Tennessee Honey and Tennessee Fire. On an annual basis the Jack Daniel's Family represents approximately half of the  volume depletions for the company's major brands. Brown-Forman's other major  brands, Finlandia Vodka, Canadian Mist and El Jimador Tequila, have experienced  further volume pressure during FY2016. The El Jimador-Brand Family depletion  volumes declined in Mexico as the company continues its brand repositioning at a  more premium price point via multi-year price increases. Brown-Forman's spirits portfolio competes primarily in the premium and super  premium categories and skews toward American whiskeys. Fitch views this as a  competitive strength, because the aging process and inventory investments  required are a barrier to entry providing an impediment particularly for value  competition. Brown-Forman spirits have taken share from beer and clear spirits,  with the favorable demand trends driven by flavored and higher-end American  whiskey. As such, Brown-Forman has experienced strong category momentum for Jack Daniel's  Tennessee Honey and the higher-priced Woodford Reserve Family with depletion  volume growth at 8% and 26%, respectively, for FY2016. Overall, the Jack  Daniel's Family depletion volumes grew by 5%. Industry demand trends should  remain positive for the foreseeable future, which, when coupled with  Brown-Forman's portfolio, would allow the company to grow at above-average rates  for the next several years. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for Brown-Forman in 2016 include: --Net revenue flat-to-slightly negative in FY2017, and growing low- to  mid-single digits in FY2018. Underlying revenue growth is expected in the 5%-6%  range over the forecast period. --EBITDA margins increasing in FY2017 to approximately 37.5%, and 40bps in  FY2018 driven by improved gross margins on the brands in the portfolio. --Capital expenditures of $108 million in FY2016, growing to over $200 million  in FY2017 to support additional capex related to the BenRiach acquisition and  distillery buildout for Slane Castle. --Free cash flow (FCF) margins growing from 4.4% in FY2016 back to the high  single digits by FY2018 driven by organic growth and capital spending declines. --Total Debt/EBITDA of 1.6x in FY2016 increasing to approximately 2.1x in FY2017  assuming Brown-Forman completes its $1 billion share authorization. Leverage  moderates to less than 2x as a result of EBITDA growth in FY2018 and beyond.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a positive  rating action include:  Positive rating actions are not anticipated in the intermediate term given the  expected increase in leverage and the Negative Outlook. Over the longer term, a  positive rating action would be based on continued strong operating performance  driven by the Jack Daniel's Brand Family combined with: --Decreased leverage such that total debt-to-operating EBITDA is below 1.5x;  --FFO adjusted leverage in the low 2x range on a sustained basis. Any potential ratings upgrade, however, would be limited given Brown-Forman's  dependence on the Jack Daniel's franchise. Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a negative  rating action include:  --Total debt/EBITDA sustained above 2x; --FFO adjusted leverage sustained above 3x; --FCF margin sustained below 5%; --A material leveraging transaction; --Further aggressive shareholder-based initiatives; --A significant and sustained loss of market share for the Jack Daniel's brand. LIQUIDITY Brown-Forman's cash balances, stable FCF generation and substantial credit  facility capacity provide good liquidity. As of April 30, 2016, Brown-Forman had  $263 million of cash. FCF for FY2016 was $150 million. FCF is expected to remain  in a similar range in FY2017 before rising back to $200 million-$300 million  annually in FY2018 and beyond as organic growth in the mid-single-digits and  expected decreases in capital spending offset the loss in cash flow from the  Southern Comfort brand. Fitch expects Brown-Forman will fund a portion of the  acquisition with offshore cash proceeds from the Southern Comfort divestiture  and should provide Brown-Forman an opportunity to access future  foreign-generated cash. The company has not drawn on its $800 million five-year credit facility that  matures in November 2018, which can be expanded by $400 million. The new 364-day  $400 million revolving facility further bolsters liquidity and serves as another  backstop to support the company's $1.2 billion commercial paper (CP) program. CP  borrowings were $271 million for the year ended April 30, 2016, which leaves  available capacity of $929 million. The five-year credit facility includes an  interest-coverage financial maintenance covenant of 3x. Brown-Forman maintains a  very manageable maturity profile with $250 million coming due in 2018.  Fitch rates Brown-Forman as follows: --Long-Term Issuer Default rating (IDR) at 'A'; --Short-Term IDR at 'F1'; --Commercial paper at 'F1'; --Senior unsecured notes at 'A'; --Bank credit facility at 'A'; --364-day revolving facility at 'A'.
