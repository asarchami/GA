7,"   By Peter Rudegeair  Bank of America Corp's (BAC.N) credit card unit did something surprising in the third quarter: it grew.The second largest U.S. bank has been cleaning up and shrinking its credit card portfolio since 2009, after getting burned by bad loans. Now that the bank has shed its worst accounts and cut its total loans by 62 percent, it is ready to dial up its lending.The bank is focused on selling credit cards to its existing customers. This will insure the bank knows more about the customers it is lending to and save money on marketing.""That was our biggest strategic choice,"" said Titi Cole, a senior executive for retail products, referring to the bank's decision to focus on existing customers. ""The card business will be smaller, but less volatile and more profitable.""So far, its efforts seem to be paying off. Average U.S. credit card balances at the Charlotte, North Carolina bank rose 0.32 percent, from $89.7 billion to $90.0 billion, between the end of June and the end of September. That's a small increase, but it's the first in at least three years. (An accounting change starting in 2010 makes it difficult to compare quarterly balances from recent years to 2009 and earlier periods.)The bank also issued 1 million new cards in the quarter, the highest number since 2008, and new card issuance in the fourth quarter should continue to be strong, chief executive Brian Moynihan said at an investor conference on December 10.Banks in general are looking to boost their credit card portfolios now — they mailed out 45 percent more credit card offers in November than they did a year earlier, according to Credit Suisse and Mintel Comperemedia data—and some, most notably Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) are focusing on marketing to existing customers.The benefits of offering cards to current customers is clear - Bank of America executives have calculated that if clients who already have a checking account sign up for a credit card or other loan from the bank, it will take in over $1,000 in additional revenue per household. It calls this strategy the ""stairstep approach"". The bank has broadly been struggling to boost revenue. Cole said in an interview that while competition in the credit card space is heating up, the size of the bank's current customer base will set it apart. Bank of America has relationships with one out of every two American households, giving the bank more relationships to use to gain new accounts, she said.""The opportunity ahead of us is tens of millions of customers still. It is not a small little opportunity,"" Moynihan said at a November investor conference.The bank does not disclose how much of its quarterly revenues or income come from credit cards.IMPORTANT SOURCE OF REVENUE  Bank of America invented the credit card in the late 1950s, building both a credit card network that turned into what is now Visa Inc. (V.N) and a portfolio of loans as well.In 2006, the bank bought MBNA, which had been the world's largest independent credit card issuer, a step that swelled Bank of America's credit card portfolio just before the financial crisis. Losses from cards jumped in 2008 and 2009, which prompted the bank to sell most of its foreign portfolios and write off many billions of dollars in loans, known as ""charging off"" in the credit card industry.Since then, the unit's credit quality has improved - Bank of America's credit card charge-offs have fallen by 80 percent since 2010, and loss rates have fallen from 12.8 percent to 3.5 percent. With a smaller portfolio, even if losses double from current rates, ""that is not a life-threatening event at all,"" Moynihan said at a news event in November.U.S. consumers are in the best position to pay their bills and increase their borrowing in years. Household debt payments as a share of disposable income are the lowest level they have been since the Federal Reserve began keeping track in 1980. Banks make money from credit cards in two ways: from the interest payments borrowers make on their loans, and from fees they receive from merchants and cardholders.Fee income has been falling across the industry. Lawmakers and regulators, spurred by lending practices that consumer advocates and merchants viewed as abusive, have limited many of the kinds of fees that banks can charge through the 2009 CARD Act and the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act.At Bank of America, non-interest income from cards, a measure of fee income, fell 12 percent in the third quarter from the same period a year earlier.Banks now have less fee income to rely on, so they are hoping to increase their interest income, which can be relatively high on a loan. The average interest rate the bank earned on credit card loans in the third quarter was 9.81 percent, over 2.5 times higher than other consumer loans like mortgages or home equity.As other businesses like mortgage refinancing slow down, credit cards could prove to be an important source of revenue for the bank, said David Robertson, the publisher of The Nilson Report.""What they've decided to do as a company is invest in the card business.

9,"  LONDON Jan 10 Bank of America Merrill Lynch  has detailed how it intends to improve working conditions for its junior bankers after one of its summer interns died.In a memo sent to staff on Friday and seen by Reuters, Bank of America said an internal review had outlined measures to ensure such staff take days off and to improve support and supervision.The review was announced after 21-year-old Moritz Erhardt died in August towards the end of a seven-week internship at the U.S. bank's investment division in London.The new measures are designed to increase ""the efficient use of our time and resources, support work-life balance, increase our junior banker staffing levels and enhance the overall work experience,"" the memo said.Erhardt's death highlighted concerns about interns working excessive hours and even through the night after newspaper reports suggested that the German student had worked for 72 hours without sleep before he died. An inquest into Erhardt's death found he died of natural causes.Effective immediately, analysts and associates are recommended to take a minimum of four weekend days off per month. Any exceptions must be pre-approved by senior managers, the memo said. The memo, from Christian Meissner, head of the bank's Global Corporate and Investment Banking (GCIB) unit, said it would make a current staffer position - responsible for how projects get allocated - into a full time post in some regions. The staffer will closely monitor work volume, hours and assignments, making sure junior bankers work on a variety of projects and develop key skills.The role of human resources and development officers will also be beefed up. The new rules will also apply to those taking up summer internships at the bank.""We are importantly committed to broader cultural change in terms of how we manage our time and how we best serve our clients,"" Meissner wrote in the memo.Bank of America declined to comment.",2014-01-10,BAC,"Fri Jan 10, 2014 | 12:48pm EST",Bank of America seeks to ensure work limits after intern's death,http://www.reuters.com//article/bankofamerica-workingconditions-idUSL6N0KK2LR20140110?type=companyNews
10,"   By Peter Rudegeair and Anil D'Silva  Bank of America Corp said on Wednesday its quarterly profit surged by nearly $3 billion as revenue increased and mortgage losses plunged, the clearest sign yet the bank was shaking off the impact of the financial crisis.The results for the second largest U.S. bank were strong across most businesses, with consumer banking having its best quarter since 2011 and the wealth management and global banking divisions posting record revenues.""They're showing some positive momentum on growing their customer base and their revenues,"" said Jonathan Finger of Finger Interests Ltd, a Houston investment firm that owns shares in the bank. ""Certainly the stock has been performing very well.""Bank of America's shares rose 2.3 percent to $17.15 on Wednesday, after earlier rising to $17.42, the highest level since May 2010. The bank's shares rose 34.6 percent last year, outpacing the broader market, and have risen some 250 percent from their post-crisis nadir in December 2011.Bank of America has been groaning under the weight of bad mortgages it took on when it bought Countrywide Financial Corp in 2008, just before the housing crisis turned into a full-blown banking meltdown. The purchase has cost it more than $45 billion in write-downs and legal settlements.On Wednesday, the bank said losses in its mortgage unit fell to $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter from $3.7 billion in the same period in 2012. In the year-earlier quarter, the bank reached several settlements totaling more than $5 billion with the federal government and mortgage finance giant Fannie Mae over foreclosures and bad loans.Results in the most recent quarter were hurt by an industry-wide drop in mortgage refinancing activity, as rates have risen. The bank made $11.6 billion in home loans, down 49 percent from the third quarter.Not all of the lingering problems from the financial crisis are behind the bank. Litigation expenses jumped to $2.3 billion in the fourth quarter from $916 million in the same period a year earlier. Chief Financial Officer Bruce Thompson said the increase was tied to mortgage securities litigation, but declined to elaborate. Even so, the company is in a much stronger position than it was during the financial crisis, when it took two bailouts from the federal government. A measure of its capital that regulators look at, known as the Basel III capital ratio, rose to 9.96 percent from 9.25 percent in the fourth quarter of 2012, and the bank said it could last 38 months without having to tap the debt markets again.Overall, fourth-quarter net income for common shareholders rose to $3.18 billion, or 29 cents per share, from $367 million, or 3 cents per share, in the same quarter of 2012, when profit was dented by about $5 billion in mortgage-related charges. Revenues increased 14 percent to $22.3 billion. Analysts estimated earnings of 26 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.""There's a company emerging from what was a pile of trouble,"" said Nancy Bush, a banking analyst at NAB Research LLC.Other banks are doing well now, too. JPMorgan Chase & Co and Wells Fargo & Co both reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings on Tuesday. Bank of America's improvement has been helping one investor in particular: Warren Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway Inc bought $5 billion of preferred shares and warrants from the bank in 2011, when investors were panicking about its mortgage holdings. Buffett has said he has no plans to exercise the warrants until near their expiration date in 2021; if he exercised them at current prices, he could sell the shares for an immediate $7 billion profit.LITTLE TERRIER Bank of America's chief executive officer, Brian Moynihan, has focused on cutting costs at the bank since he took the top job in 2010 and announced plans in 2011 to save the bank $8 billion per year. The bank is making progress toward his goals - operating costs in the fourth quarter fell by 6 percent to $17.3 billion.""If you think back three years when he got there, nobody believed that he could do what he's done,"" said Bush. ""He's like a little terrier. When you set him on a task, he's going to keep digging and digging till he finds the bone."" Credit costs have also been falling. The bank set aside $336 million to cover bad loans in the quarter, compared with $2.2 billion a year earlier. It released $1.2 billion from reserves to cover bad loans, compared with $900 million a year earlier and $1.4 billion in the third quarter.As the bank's executives get other issues under control, Moynihan said last April, boosting revenue has to be the main focus.Those efforts may be paying off. For the fourth quarter, Bank of America's global wealth and investment management business posted a 7 percent increase in revenue, to $4.5 billion, driven by higher fee income and customers depositing more funds into their accounts. Net income rose 35 percent to a record $777 million.Revenue also rose in investment banking, where fees increased 9 percent to $1.7 billion as companies around the world took advantage of record high stock prices to raise equity capital. Bank of America executives were optimistic the bank would benefit as dealmaking activity and debt and equity underwriting increased.""There's not one piece we look at within the pipelines that we don't feel good about,"" Thompson said on the call.Revenue for global banking as a whole rose 9 percent to $4.31 billion, but net income dropped 9 percent to $1.27 billion as the company set aside more funds to cover possible losses on commercial loans.Equity trading revenue jumped 27 percent to $904 million from a year earlier, and bond trading revenue rose 16 percent to $2.08 billion, excluding accounting adjustments linked to changes in the value of the company's debt. In bond trading, stronger results in credit and mortgage products offset weakness in rates and commodities.(Reporting by Peter Rudegeair in New York and Anil D'Silva in Bangalore; Editing by Dan Wilchins, Ted Kerr, Jeffrey Benkoe and Leslie Adler)",2014-01-15,BAC,"Wed Jan 15, 2014 | 5:10pm EST",Bank of America fourth-quarter profit rises as bank shakes off financial crisis,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-bofa-results-idUSBREA0E0OQ20140115?type=companyNews
11,"   By Ryan Vlastelica | NEW YORK  NEW YORK U.S. stocks rose on Wednesday, with the S&P 500 climbing to an all-time closing high after strong earnings from Bank of America and data signaled that the economy was improving.Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) climbed 2.3 percent to $17.15 and gave one of the biggest boosts to the S&P 500 after the second-largest U.S. bank said its quarterly profit surged by nearly $3 billion on an increase in revenue.The report came a day after both JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) and Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) also posted better-than-expected earnings, though Wells Fargo's mortgage lending slowed to the lowest level in five years.""So far so good with bank earnings this season, and it is very positive that we're seeing significant declines in foreclosures, which is very positive for the economy,"" said David Kelly, chief global strategist for JPMorgan Funds in New York.In the latest economic data, the seasonally adjusted Producer Price Index rose 0.4 percent last month, the biggest increase since June, although inflation pressures remained benign. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York's ""Empire State"" index of general business conditions climbed to its highest level in 20 months.The data reassured investors that the economy is able to stand on its own even as the Federal Reserve begins to slow its massive stimulus programs, which contributed to huge equity gains in 2013. Wall Street's rally on Wednesday erased some of 2014's early weakness, putting the S&P 500 near the break-even level for the year.In its latest Beige Book report on business activity, the Fed said the economy grew at a moderate pace from late November through the end of 2013, with some regions of the country expecting a pickup in growth. ""The general trend of economic numbers is pretty positive, and helping to get people over the shock of the recent weak payroll report,"" said Kelly, who helps oversee $400 billion in assets. ""An improving economy is a trend of 2014, and that will be good for equities throughout the year.""The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI rose 108.08 points, or 0.66 percent, to end at 16,481.94. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index .SPX advanced 9.50 points, or 0.52 percent, to close at 1,848.38. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC gained 31.87 points, or 0.76 percent, to finish at 4,214.88.The S&P 500 ended at a record high, beating its previous record close by just 0.02 of a point. At its session peak, the index climbed to 1,850.84, a record intraday high.

15,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, January 15 (Fitch) Bank of America Corporation's (BAC) stated fourth  quarter earnings to common shareholders (4Q'13) of $3.2 billion improved from  $2.2 billion in the sequential quarter and $367 million in the year-ago quarter.  Fitch Ratings notes that earnings benefited from a large $1.2 billion reserve  release in 4Q'13, just modestly down from the $1.4 billion release in the  sequential quarter. Fitch notes that reserve releases of this size over the last  two quarters are very large, and given that credit quality is likely around a  cyclical trough, Fitch would expect the benefit from reserve releases to  markedly decline over the course of the next year. Fitch calculated pre-tax profits, which exclude CVA/DVA adjustments and various  other gains/charges, were unchanged from the prior quarter at $4.3 billion, but  up substantially from the $2.1 billion in the prior year's quarter. This  quarter's Fitch calculated results equate to a 0.82% pre-tax adjusted return on  assets (ROA), unchanged from the prior quarter, but up from 0.4% in the year-ago  quarter. These results were better than expected, but the improvement does include the  large reserve release noted above. In 4Q'13, the $1.2 billion release  contributed 23 basis points to the Fitch calculated ROA, compared to a  contribution from reserve releases of 27 basis points in 3Q'13, indicating that  core earnings improved from the sequential quarter. Part of this improvement is  due to better earnings generation and part of it is due to a favorable  comparison against relatively weaker 3Q'13 earnings. BAC's net interest income (NII) improved, and grew 5.07% from the sequential  quarter driven by modestly higher income from trading assets, higher yields on  securities, continued reductions in long-term debt balances and costs, as well  as somewhat surprisingly still lower rates paid on core deposits. Fitch would  expect to still see some benefit to NII from further reductions in higher cost  long-term debt balances, though notes that more meaningful NII expansion will be  predicated on loan growth. On balance, BAC's loan portfolio continues to show reductions in consumer loan  balances given the continued run-off of legacy portfolios and planned reductions  in consumer mortgages, with continued increases in commercial lending offsetting  these reductions. Non-interest income of $10.7 billion during the quarter was good, though lower  than in prior quarters. In 4Q'13 relative to 3Q13, continued strength in wealth  management amid higher equity markets and improved investment banking results  were more than offset by seasonally lower trading account profits, lower equity  investment income, and a generally slowing mortgage banking area. Fitch does  note, however, that mortgage banking did increase from the sequential quarter  due to low contra revenue impacts from representation and warranty exposures,  though Fitch expects core mortgage banking results to be less than they were in  the last year. BAC continues to make progress on reducing core expenses under its 'New BAC'  initiatives, though this continues to be offset by litigation expense which  remains a drag on overall earnings. In 4Q'13, BAC's litigation expense of $2.3  billion was $1.2 billion higher than the $1.1 billion of litigation expense in  3Q'13, and was largely related to BAC's building reservers for ongoing  litigation on residential mortgage backed securities (RMBS) issues. BAC still has a number of litigation issues outstanding, the largest of which  constitute getting court approval for its Bank of New York (BNY) as trustee  settlement as well as pending litigation in both New York and California with  the Federal Finance Housing Agency (FHFA). As these issues continue to move  forward, Fitch would expect some additional litigation costs as well as  potential additions to reserves over time. BAC's capital and liquidity position remain good, in Fitch's opinion, which in  conjunction with continued earnings generation provide a buffer to absorb  additional litigation costs noted above. As of the end of 4Q'13, BAC's global  excess liquidity sources amounted to $376 billion, and its time to required  funding was at 38 months. On the capital front, BAC's Tier 1 common capital  ratio (CET1) was 11.19%, up from 11.08% in the sequential quarter, and its fully  phased in Basel III CET1 ratio under the advanced approach was 9.96%, up from  9.94% in the sequential quarter.

21,"  DETROIT Jan 16 A U.S. bankruptcy judge on Thursday rejected a deal allowing Detroit to end costly interest-rate swap agreements with two investment banks, possibly further delaying when the city will submit to the court its plan to adjust its debt.Ending swaps agreements with UBS AG and Bank of America Corp's Merrill Lynch Capital Services for $165 million - a 43 percent discount - has been a key component of Detroit emergency manager Kevyn Orr's plan to adjust the city's finances through the bankruptcy process.Judge Steven Rhodes, who is overseeing the city's historic bankruptcy, said Detroit likely could succeed with potential challenges to the validity of the swaps agreements. The $165 million cost of eliminating the swaps was ""too high a price to pay,"" Rhodes said.Despite rejecting the deal, Rhodes said that settling the swaps deal for less is more advantageous than litigating the claims. Rhodes said he ""strongly encourages the parties to continue to negotiate"" even if the city decides that filing suit is its best option.The swaps were used to hedge interest-rate risk for some of the $1.4 billion of pension debt the city sold in 2005 and 2006.Detroit had planned to finance the swaps termination through a $285 million loan from Barclays Plc, but the judge denied the city's request to borrow that sum. Detroit could, however, still borrow $120 million to improve services, Rhodes ruled. The $285 million loan from Barclays had been contingent on Detroit's pledging funds from the city's casino tax as collateral, but those funds are pledged as security on the original swaps agreements with UBS and Merrill Lynch.It was not immediately clear if Barclays would be willing to provide the $120 million loan to help Detroit cover the cost of city services.Representatives of UBS and Bank of America declined to comment on the judge's ruling. Orr's spokesman, Bill Nowling, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Robert Gordon, lawyer for the city's pension funds, said Detroit's planned payment to UBS and Merrill essentially treated them as secured creditors. ""Paying them close to whole dollars was just far too rich,"" Gordon said. Detroit's pension funds, bond insurers, banks and others   opposed the termination deal. The objectors argued that the city should not have settled with the banks because it had convincing legal arguments to completely terminate the swaps.But Orr, who has been running Detroit since March, testified in court that the city had only a 50-50 shot of winning the litigation, and he did not want to risk expensive legal proceedings or losing access to casino tax revenue, which was used as a lien in the swaps. The casino tax accounts for about 20 percent of the city budget, Orr has said.The deal Rhodes rejected was the city's second such agreement with its swaps counterparties. Detroit originally had proposed a deal with Merrill and UBS in which the city would have ended the swaps at 75 cents on the dollar with a $230 million payment, but in a December hearing Rhodes called on the city to negotiate more favorable terms. Detroit reached the new agreement with the banks after two days of mediation in late December.Orr testified in court earlier this month that Detroit initially proposed a termination fee of $145 million to $150 million but that the investment banks would not agree to anything less than $165 million.The swaps deal is one of the obstacles the city has sought to clear away so Orr can submit a proposal to the court on how Detroit plans to deal with its more than $18 billion in debt.Meanwhile, mediation efforts have begun to bear fruit, with philanthropic foundations connected to Detroit pledging $330 million to help the city. In addition, Governor Rick Snyder is  preparing to propose $350 million of support, over 20 years, to help protect worker pensions and prevent the Detroit Institute of Arts collection from being sold, according to reports on Thursday in the Detroit Free Press and elsewhere.Orr had said he was going to submit the plan to the court in the first week of January, but that was delayed until the swaps were settled and other mediation efforts played out, Orr's spokesman, Nowling, said in an email last week.""If it looks like mediation efforts are bearing fruit, it could push back the release date as we look to include any mediated agreements in the plan,"" Nowling said.",2014-01-16,BAC,"Thu Jan 16, 2014 | 5:01pm EST",UPDATE 1-U.S. judge rejects deal to end Detroit swap agreements,http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-detroit-bankruptcy-idUSL2N0KQ1XP20140116?type=companyNews
22,"   By Karen Freifeld and Jonathan Stempel | NEW YORK  NEW YORK The New York judge weighing approval of Bank of America Corp's $8.5 billion settlement with investors in mortgage securities was promoted on Friday, but is expected to rule on the controversial accord before she takes her new job early next month.Justice Barbara Kapnick of the New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan, who heard nine weeks of testimony about the fairness of one of the biggest settlements stemming from the 2008 financial crisis, was appointed to the state's Appellate Division, an intermediate appeals court, by Governor Andrew Cuomo.Bank of America had agreed in June 2011 to the $8.5 billion settlement to resolve claims over roughly $174 billion of mortgage-backed securities issued by the former Countrywide Financial Corp, which the bank had bought three years earlier.The settlement was intended to resolve much of the Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank's legal liability from Countrywide. It was backed by 22 institutional investors including BlackRock Inc, MetLife Inc and Allianz SE's Pacific Investment Management Co.But investors led by American International Group Inc objected, saying there was no proof the payouts were fair, and that Bank of New York Mellon Corp failed to perform its duties as trustee during the negotiations. Kapnick had overseen a so-called Article 77 proceeding, which ended on November 21, to determine whether the settlement should be approved.A spokesman for Cuomo said Kapnick's promotion takes effect on Monday, February 3. This suggests that a decision on the Bank of America case could come within the next two weeks.""The judge is going to be issuing that decision before she leaves,"" a staff member in Kapnick's chambers said in an interview after the promotion was announced. David Bookstaver, a spokesman for the New York state court system, said state law appeared to allow promoted judges to decide cases they were already handling and which were ready for rulings.Kathy Patrick, a lawyer for the institutional investors, said: ""New York law permits Judge Kapnick to rule on this matter, and we look forward to her decision.""Bank of America spokesman Lawrence Grayson and AIG spokesman Jon Diat declined to comment. A Bank of New York Mellon spokesman had no immediate comment. Kapnick, 60, will fill a vacancy on the Appellate Division for the First Department, which encompasses Manhattan and the Bronx. Her promotion does not require voter or legislative approval.The judge was elected to the Supreme Court, which in New York is a trial court, in 2001, and moved to its commercial division in 2008. She graduated from Barnard College in 1975 and Boston University School of Law in 1980.Cuomo on Friday also appointed three trial judges - Colleen Duffy, Hector LaSalle and Joseph Maltese - to fill vacancies in the Appellate Division for the Second Department, which encompasses 10 counties in southeastern New York, including the other New York City boroughs and Long Island.The case is In re: Bank of New York Mellon, New York State Supreme Court, New York County, No. 651786/2011.(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel and Karen Freifeld in New York; Editing by Jonathan Oatis and David Gregorio)",2014-01-17,BAC,"Fri Jan 17, 2014 | 6:08pm EST","Judge in $8.5 billion Bank of America case is promoted, likely to rule soon",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-bankofamerica-settlement-idUSBREA0G1MY20140117?type=companyNews
23,"   By Karen Freifeld | NEW YORK  NEW YORK New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman has abandoned his effort to obtain damages from Bank of America Corp over its purchase of Merrill Lynch & Co, but plans to press on with the case, his lawyers said in court on Friday.Schneiderman will seek to bar the bank's former chief executive, Kenneth Lewis, and former chief financial officer, Joe Price, from the securities industry and from serving on boards of public companies, according to his office. It was not clear what sanctions he would seek from the bank.The 2010 lawsuit filed in New York state court by Schneiderman's predecessor, Andrew Cuomo, accused Bank of America of misleading shareholders about Merrill's losses and bonus largesse prior to a December 2008 vote on the merger.Merrill posted a $15.84 billion loss in the fourth quarter of that year, even as it paid out $3.62 billion in bonuses. The merger closed in January 2009.Last April, a federal judge approved a $2.43 billion class-action settlement on behalf of shareholders. Under a 2008 decision by New York state's highest court, Schneiderman cannot recover damages on behalf of investors who have already settled.""We're not seeking damages in this case,"" Philip Barber, a lawyer for Schneiderman, said at a status conference on Friday. ""It has been a number of years and we're trying to move this to conclusion.""He said the office would seek a judgment against the defendants, but did not specify what it should contain. Lawyers for the bank and the executives said they would try to have the case dismissed before trial. Schneiderman, who became state attorney general in 2011, was criticized this week by people close to Cuomo for failing to get the case completed before the class action settlement.Schneiderman's office told Reuters on Friday the $2.43 billion settlement in the class action had provided ""great relief"" to the investors, and that the private settlement used evidence gathered by the office. The New York Times this week reported a deteriorating relationship between Schneiderman and Cuomo, and noted a battle over $613 million New York received as part of JPMorgan Chase & Co's $13 billion settlement with U.S. authorities over mortgage-backed securities.A Schneiderman spokesman declined to comment on the relationship on Friday. A Cuomo spokesman did not return a call for comment.Lawrence Grayson, a spokesman for Bank of America, declined to comment on New York's pursuit of the case.

25,"  NEW YORK Fund investors worldwide poured $6.6 billion into stock funds in the week ended January 22 on optimism that stocks would push higher this year, data from a Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global Research report showed on Friday.The new demand brought inflows into stock funds so far this year to $16 billion, following a record inflow of $358 billion in 2013, according to the report, which also cited data from fund-tracking firm EPFR Global.The inflows came even as the benchmark Standard & Poor's 500 .SPX stock index fell a modest 0.2 percent over the holiday-shortened week on some disappointing corporate earnings. The U.S. stock market was closed Monday for the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday.""If you get a pullback, that's a natural time for people who have been wanting to buy to step in,"" said Michael Jones, chief investment officer of RiverFront Investment Group, with $4.3 billion in assets.The S&P 500 index hit record highs last year and rallied nearly 30 percent, but some analysts believe the market may rally further this year.Still, the inflows into stock funds were below the prior week's inflows of $9.4 billion. The earlier inflows were largely a result of a $6.5 billion cash surge into stock mutual funds, which are commonly purchased by retail investors.Funds that specialize in European stocks attracted $4.3 billion, marking their 30th straight week of inflows. Some investors have said the region's stocks offer buying opportunities after data last August showed the region exited a 1-1/2 year-long recession.Investors also parked $30 billion in low-risk money market funds, which typically invest in safe short-term securities, marking their largest inflows in 7 weeks.Investors likely sought money market funds partly on the weakness in stock markets, said Jonathan Lewis, chief investment officer of Samson Capital Advisors, which oversees over $7 billion.Precious metals funds attracted small inflows of $33 million, marking their first inflows in 19 weeks. Those came even as the spot price of gold slipped about 1 percent on January 21, the most since the start of the year. Emerging market stock funds, meanwhile, posted outflows of $2.4 billion, marking their biggest outflows in five weeks. The outflows marked a 13th straight week of withdrawals from the funds, the longest outflow streak in 11 years, according to the report.MSCI's emerging markets equities index .MSCIEF fell 0.2 percent over the weekly period.""There is a recognition that there are some real problems at the heart of some major emerging market economies,"" said Jones of RiverFront. He said investors feared a continued economic slowdown in Russia, Brazil, and China. Bond funds worldwide attracted $2 billion, bringing inflows this year to $8 billion. Funds that hold high-yield bonds, which are considered risky since they have lower-quality credit ratings, attracted $1 billion of the new money, marking their fifth straight week of inflows.Investors also had an appetite for safer bonds. Funds that hold higher-quality investment-grade corporate bonds attracted $1.6 billion, marking their fifth straight week of inflows, while funds that mainly hold safe-haven U.S. Treasuries attracted a small $200 million in new cash.The yield on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes fell just 2 basis points to 2.86 percent throughout the week after economic data on U.S. housing starts, industrial output, and inflation came in as expected. Bond yields move inversely to their prices.The latest inflows follow bond outflows of $91 billion in 2013 after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke signaled last May that the Fed would begin reducing its bond-buying stimulus program, resulting in price losses on bonds and withdrawals from bond funds.""As we enter 2014, the bond market is oversold,"" said Lewis of Samson Capital.

28,"   By Peter Rudegeair  Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) is trying to solve one of the most difficult problems that big banks face: convincing reluctant employees to sell more products to current customers, who are themselves reluctant to buy them.The bank says that in at least one part of its operations, namely administering 401(k) plans and related accounts for companies, it is making real progress. It attributes its success to pay incentives, working harder to zero in on the right clients, and training specialist sales staff.In terms of the number of plans, it sold nearly three times more to clients in 2013 than it did a year before, said Bank of America spokesman Matthew Card. In the first year that it tried to attract existing banking clients of all sizes, the bank won 750 new retirement plans compared with the 263 plans it won in 2012.""We set aggressive goals and this year for 2013 they hit all the goals,"" chief executive Brian Moynihan said on a January 15 conference call with analysts, referring to the business.By other measures, its progress in selling retirement services has been halting. It won $14 billion of assets from existing clients last year, up just a touch from 2012's $13.9 billion.Most of the 2013 growth came from selling smaller plans to smaller companies. The bank won 470 plans from these clients in 2013 compared to 70 in 2012.Selling these services is complicated, but Bank of America's efforts are also critical as the second-largest U.S. bank tries to increase its revenue. It has a vast customer base - serving one out of every two U.S. households, for example - making it tough to win new customers. Instead, the bank under Moynihan is trying to win more revenue from existing clients, a practice known as ""cross-selling.""For decades, banks have tried to cross-sell customers everything from insurance to wealth management in the hopes of boosting sales. What they often find is, employees used to selling one kind of product struggle to sell something different, and setting up systems to facilitate cross-selling can take some time. ""It's better than it used to be,"" said one veteran Merrill Lynch broker of the process to sell more retirement services to current clients. ""It used to be like the Wild West where you just started chasing companies for 401(k) business. Prospects got pissed because they had six different people talking to them.""To see how the bank's efforts may be bearing fruit in these kinds of services, consider the way it won business from a tour bus company in Hawaii that was already a banking customer.Mark Perry, a regional executive at the global commercial bank based in San Francisco, said some of his bankers pitched the company on what products they could offer. Then a group of brokers from the bank's Merrill Lynch wealth management unit paid a visit to the bus company's offices to educate employees on crafting and meeting their retirement and investment goals. They sealed the deal.Bank of America is behind rivals in the retirement plan business by some metrics: it administered $103.9 billion in defined-contribution benefit plan assets in 2012, less than JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) and Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), according to data from Cerulli Associates. Overall, the financial benefit plan business is responsible for more than $1 billion in annual revenue for the bank. It is impossible to tell how much the bank's efforts at cross-selling are boosting the bottom line in this business, but Bank of America officials say that income from servicing retirement plans helped propel both revenue and profitability at the bank's global wealth and investment management division to record levels in 2013. The division accounts for around 21 percent of the entire company's revenues.GETTING FOCUSED Kevin Crain, Bank of America's managing director in retirement and benefit plans services, has been working for years to figure out how to convince bankers to sell his product.In 2010, Crain asked bankers to refer all mid-sized clients to his division that might be a good fit. His group soon found itself flooded with referrals ""that didn't have a whole lot of life to them,"" he said. Crain also heard complaints from bankers that were hesitant to entrust their clients to different people at Bank of America. Then, Crain decided instead to get more focused. He designated around 125 to 150 Merrill Lynch retail brokers to work directly with the bankers in presenting Merrill's retirement capabilities to clients.Brokers took an added interest in selling companies' retirement plan because when employees switch jobs they often look for a broker to help them roll over money they have in a 401(k) account into another type of savings plan, Crain said.To encourage commercial bankers to buy into the strategy, a component of their pay started to be based on the total revenue a client brought to Bank of America. Retirement plans provide a very good revenue stream that will naturally grow each year once the plan is sold, so ""a banker takes an interest in that,"" Crain said.The brokers would sit down with bankers to target businesses that lie within Bank of America's ""sweet spot,"" Crain said. Those companies usually had plans ranging from about $5 million to $50 million of assets, and they usually had many different types of plans, like 401(k)s and health savings accounts, for which they only wanted one administrator. That gave the bank a shot at multiple sources of revenue.CROSS-SELLING NOT SO EASY Cross-selling is particularly thorny when it comes to bankers that deal with businesses. A lender might have a relationship with a company's treasurer or chief financial officer, but decisions about other products, such as retirement plan services, might be made by other officials, such as heads of human resources. The banker must then get to know someone new at the company.""Just because you have a good relationship with one part of a client, it doesn't always transfer to the ability to gain mindshare with other parts of that organization,"" said Derek De Vries, a bank analyst at UBS Investment Research.(Reporting by Peter Rudegeair, additional reporting by Jed Horowitz, editing by Dan Wilchins and Andrew Hay)",2014-01-30,BAC,"Thu Jan 30, 2014 | 12:44pm EST","To sell more, BofA turns to existing clients",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-bankofamerica-selling-analysis-idUSBREA0T1I820140130?type=companyNews

30,"   By Karen Freifeld | NEW YORK  NEW YORK A New York state judge on Friday approved Bank of America Corp's (BAC.N) $8.5 billion settlement with investors in mortgage securities, which would resolve much of the bank's liability from its acquisition of Countrywide Financial Corp during the financial crisis.Justice Barbara Kapnick ruled that Bank of New York Mellon (BK.N), the trustee overseeing the securities, had mostly acted reasonably and in good faith in determining that the settlement was in the best interests of the investors.American International Group Inc (AIG.N), which led opposition to the settlement, plans to appeal aspects of the decision, a lawyer for the insurer said.Bank of America agreed to the settlement in June 2011 to resolve the claims of investors who had bought $174 billion of mortgage-backed securities issued by Countrywide. The investors said Countrywide misrepresented the quality of the underlying home mortgages, which went sour in the housing crisis.Countrywide, based in Calabasas, California, was the biggest home mortgage lender in the United States until the housing market collapsed, specializing in so-called subprime loans, most of which it packaged into securities and resold to investors. It was bought by Bank of America in 2008.A group of 22 investors supported the settlement, including institutions such as BlackRock Inc (BLK.N), MetLife Inc (MET.N) and Allianz SE's (ALVG.DE) Pacific Investment Management Co.But investors led by AIG (AIG.N) objected, arguing that they were cut out of negotiations and that there was no evidence the settlement was adequate.The objectors said Bank of New York Mellon was protecting its own interests in supporting the settlement, saying that it did business with Bank of America. The objectors also criticized the Bank of New York Mellon for failing to review loan files to identify defective loans in the securities. In her ruling on Friday, Kapnick wrote that it was clear Bank of New York Mellon was concerned that Countrywide would be unable to pay a future judgment that even approached $8.5 billion, and thought it was reasonable to lock in a one-time payment.This was especially so, given that it was ""uncertain, at best"" whether Bank of America would be held responsible for Countrywide's liabilities, she wrote.Kapnick made one exception in her ruling, withholding her approval from settlement of claims relating to certain loans that had been modified. Bank of New York Mellon should not have settled claims related to mortgages that had been modified without investigating their potential worth, she said.""This court finds that, except for the finding ... regarding the loan modification claims, the trustee did not abuse its discretion in entering into the settlement agreement and did not act in bad faith or outside the bounds of reasonable judgment,"" Kapnick wrote.It was not clear what impact the judge's exclusion would have on the settlement. ""The issue has the prospect of adding another wrinkle in the timing of the next steps and eventually in determining when the cash flows get paid to bondholders,"" analysts at Barclays said in a report for clients.Bank of America shares closed down 1.1 percent to $16.75 Friday.Representatives of Bank of America and Bank of New York Mellon both said they were pleased with the approval.""We believe any outstanding issues raised in the opinion can be addressed without undue delay,"" said Lawrence Grayson, a spokesman for Bank of America. A lawyer for AIG, Mark Zauderer took the opposite view. He said the insurer was pleased by the judge's exception for modified loans but disagreed with the other aspects of the ruling.""This case is very far from over because the settlement will not take effect until many potential post-trial motions and appeals are resolved,"" Zauderer said in a statement. He also called the loan modification issue ""critical.""The settlement is part of Bank of America's efforts to put liabilities for the financial crisis behind it. It has agreed to pay more than $45 billion to end disputes that came from the financial crisis, including the $8.5 billion Countrywide settlement.Bank of New York Mellon sought judicial approval of the settlement two-and-a-half years ago.As the case dragged on, the number of opponents dwindled. Among them, the attorneys general of New York and Delaware, who intervened in the proceeding in 2011, said last May they would no longer block the accord.Kapnick oversaw a months-long proceeding to determine whether to approve the settlement, which ended on November 21.

31,"  By Karen FreifeldNEW YORK Jan 31 A New York state judge on Friday approved Bank of America Corp's $8.5 billion settlement with investors in mortgage securities, which would resolve much of the bank's liability from its acquisition of Countrywide Financial Corp during the financial crisis.Justice Barbara Kapnick ruled that Bank of New York Mellon , the trustee overseeing the securities, had mostly acted reasonably and in good faith in determining that the settlement was in the best interests of the investors.American International Group Inc, which led opposition to the settlement, plans to appeal aspects of the decision, a lawyer for the insurer said.Bank of America agreed to the settlement in June 2011 to resolve the claims of investors who had bought $174 billion of mortgage-backed securities issued by Countrywide. The investors said Countrywide misrepresented the quality of the underlying home mortgages, which went sour in the housing crisis.Countrywide, based in Calabasas, California, was the biggest home mortgage lender in the United States until the housing market collapsed, specializing in so-called subprime loans, most of which it packaged into securities and resold to investors. It was bought by Bank of America in 2008.A group of 22 investors supported the settlement, including institutions such as BlackRock Inc, MetLife Inc  and Allianz SE's Pacific Investment Management Co.But investors led by AIG objected, arguing that they were cut out of negotiations and that there was no evidence the settlement was adequate. The objectors said Bank of New York Mellon was protecting its own interests in supporting the settlement, saying that it did business with Bank of America. The objectors also criticized the Bank of New York Mellon for failing to review loan files to identify defective loans in the securities.In her ruling on Friday, Kapnick wrote that it was clear Bank of New York Mellon was concerned that Countrywide would be unable to pay a future judgment that even approached $8.5 billion, and thought it was reasonable to lock in a one-time payment.This was especially so, given that it was ""uncertain, at best"" whether Bank of America would be held responsible for Countrywide's liabilities, she wrote.Kapnick made one exception in her ruling, withholding her approval from settlement of claims relating to certain loans that had been modified. Bank of New York Mellon should not have settled claims related to mortgages that had been modified without investigating their potential worth, she said.""This court finds that, except for the finding ... regarding the loan modification claims, the trustee did not abuse its discretion in entering into the settlement agreement and did not act in bad faith or outside the bounds of reasonable judgment,"" Kapnick wrote. It was not clear what impact the judge's exclusion would have on the settlement.""The issue has the prospect of adding another wrinkle in the timing of the next steps and eventually in determining when the cash flows get paid to bondholders,"" analysts at Barclays said in a report for clients.Bank of America shares closed down 1.1 percent to $16.75 Friday.Representatives of Bank of America and Bank of New York Mellon both said they were pleased with the approval. ""We believe any outstanding issues raised in the opinion can be addressed without undue delay,"" said Lawrence Grayson, a spokesman for Bank of America.A lawyer for AIG, Mark Zauderer took the opposite view. He said the insurer was pleased by the judge's exception for modified loans but disagreed with the other aspects of the ruling.""This case is very far from over because the settlement will not take effect until many potential post-trial motions and appeals are resolved,"" Zauderer said in a statement. He also called the loan modification issue ""critical.""The settlement is part of Bank of America's efforts to put liabilities for the financial crisis behind it. It has agreed to pay more than $45 billion to end disputes that came from the financial crisis, including the $8.5 billion Countrywide settlement.Bank of New York Mellon sought judicial approval of the settlement two-and-a-half years ago.As the case dragged on, the number of opponents dwindled. Among them, the attorneys general of New York and Delaware, who intervened in the proceeding in 2011, said last May they would no longer block the accord.Kapnick oversaw a months-long proceeding to determine whether to approve the settlement, which ended on Nov. 21.

32,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, January 31 (Fitch) Todayâ€™s decision by a New York State Supreme Court  judge to approve the terms of a settlement between private-label mortgage  securitization investors and Bank of America (BAC) is positive for the bankâ€™s  credit profile, if not successfully appealed with respect to loan modifications,  according to Fitch Ratings. The settlement removes a substantial source of  uncertainty from BACâ€™s remaining contingent liabilities, though future appeals  are possible. BAC is fully reserved for the $8.5 billion settlement (in addition to $100  million for legal and administration fees). Following this settlement, BAC faces  remaining litigation exposure in New York and California related to Federal  Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) private-label securitization (PLS) claims.  However, BAC is now better positioned to fund future litigation losses. In a prior special report, we estimated that the remaining FHFA litigation  losses for BAC could total between $5 billion and $8 billion. With todayâ€™s  settlement complete, we think the FHFA losses can be managed by the bank within  the context of current expectations for earnings and capital ratios. The judge ruled that the 2011 settlement between investors, BAC and trustee Bank  of New York Mellon (BNY) should be upheld, noting that BNY acted in good faith.  We believe that the approval of the settlement likely reflected, in part, the  fact that litigants had dropped objections given improving PLS performance over  the past two years as the housing market has begun to recover. While the approval of the settlement is a positive for BAC, there is no impact  on current ratings. Longer-term ratings momentum will be predicated on  meaningful and sustained earnings improvement, capital ratios that compare more  favorably with large bank peers and a continued wind-down of legacy litigation  liabilities and impaired assets.

38,"   By Guillermo Parra-Bernal | SAO PAULO  SAO PAULO Feb 3 Brazil's Investimentos e Participações em Infra-Estrutura SA will delay its initial public offering until the second quarter, a source with direct knowledge of the matter said, suggesting that investor concerns over recent turmoil in emerging markets may have eased by then.Invepar, controlled by one investment fund, two state-controlled pension funds and construction giant OAS SA , wants to raise about 2 billion reais ($833 million) with the IPO, said the source, who declined to be identified because the plan is in the works.The offering ""could happen in May or June, when a window of opportunity opens and market conditions become a little more constructive,"" the source said.The delay in Invepar's IPO comes as companies in Brazil face fundraising challenge this year. Rising borrowing costs, weak growth, a presidential election, and the withdrawal of monetary stimulus in the United States have left investors skittish. In addition, tighter global liquidity is making Brazilian IPOs less attractive for foreign investors who have traditionally bought two-thirds of new issues for years.     Since the start of 2013, Brazil's Bovespa stock index  has shed 23 percent, while investors have pulled about $12.6 billion from domestic financial markets in the same period.Pension funds Petros and Funcef, an investment fund run by state-run Banco do Brasil SA, and OAS wanted Invepar to price its IPO by February, sources said last year.Invepar has mulled the deal for two years, the source said. ""Invepar is considering, among many alternatives for fundraising, an IPO,"" the company said in a statement to Reuters. ""Should Invepar opt for that alternative, markets will be promptly informed.""Investors such as Fator Administradora de Recursos' Fabio Moser said an Invepar IPO would offer exposure to Brazil's fast-growing infrastructure sector. Creating an attractive environment for infrastructure may bolster Brazil's economy, which has struggled in the past three years. The country has the lowest investment ratio among Latin America's top economies despite getting the region's biggest chunk of direct investments and capital inflows.Invepar operates toll roads in Brazil and Peru, a subway line in Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo's international airport - Brazil's busiest.The company hired the investment-banking units of Banco do Brasil, Bank of America Corp, Itaú Unibanco Holding SA , Grupo BTG Pactual SA , Banco Bradesco SA, Citigroup Inc and HSBC Holdings Plc to handle the deal, the source said.",2014-02-03,BAC,"Mon Feb 3, 2014 | 10:26am EST","Brazil's Invepar to delay IPO until May or June, source says",http://www.reuters.com//article/brazil-ipo-invepar-idUSL2N0L70GY20140203?type=companyNews
39,"   By Sam Forgione | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Fund investors worldwide pulled a record $28.3 billion out of stock funds in the week ended Wednesday after mixed U.S. economic data fueled concerns of a major downturn in U.S. stocks, data from a Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global Research report showed on Friday.The outflows from stock funds in the week ended February 5 were the biggest, in dollar terms, since records began in 2002, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch, which also cited data from fund-tracking firm EPFR Global. Bond funds, meanwhile, attracted a record $15 billion in new cash.Funds that specialize in U.S. stocks were hit hardest, with outflows of $24 billion, with most of the withdrawals coming from exchange-traded funds, according to the report. The weekly outflows from U.S.-focused stock funds were also a record in dollar terms.The outflows from stock funds and inflows into bond funds underscored investors' nervousness that U.S. stocks, which rallied to record highs in 2013 on the heels of the Federal Reserve's monthly bond-buying, could suffer a steep pullback.""Now that the Fed is starting to turn off the spigot, people are unwinding some of their risk,"" said Robert Francello, head trader at Apex Capital in San Francisco. Investors reacted strongly on February 3 to a weaker-than-expected Institute for Supply Management report showing U.S. manufacturing activity slowed sharply in January, with the benchmark Standard & Poor's 500 stock index recording its worst single-day drop in seven months.The S&P 500 fell 1.3 percent over the entire weekly period.Fears of a protracted capital flight out of emerging market assets also lingered, leading investors to pull $6.5 billion out of emerging market stock funds. That extended withdrawals from the funds to 15 weeks, the longest outflow streak on record. Investors' risk aversion drove them into bond funds, which attracted their largest weekly inflows, in dollar terms, on record.Funds that mainly hold safe-haven U.S. Treasuries attracted $13.2 billion of the roughly $15 billion total, although the report said asset manager Good Harbor Financial pulled cash out of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust and poured money into ETFs that hold Treasuries, likely accounting for $10 billion of the total inflows into Treasury funds. The weaker-than-expected data on U.S. factory activity spurred safe-haven bids, pushing the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note down to 2.57 percent on the day of the release, its lowest since the beginning of November. Bond yields move inversely to prices.Investment-grade bond funds attracted $4.2 billion in new cash, marking the biggest inflows into the funds since May of last year, but investors shunned riskier high-yield bond funds. Those funds posted outflows of $1.2 billion, their biggest since last August.""Worries seemed to peak for the moment earlier this week,"" said Jake Lowery, portfolio manager with ING U.S. Investment Management in Atlanta. ""Flows into bond funds were driven primarily by the risk-off sentiment.""Commodities funds also posted their 13th straight week of outflows, bringing withdrawals this year to $2 billion. Gold prices rallied on safe-haven buying on the weak U.S. factory data, but retreated from their highs later in the week after U.S. services sector data showed a pickup in growth, leaving investors uncertain about the pace of the U.S. recovery.(Reporting by Sam Forgione; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and James Dalgleish)",2014-02-07,BAC,"Fri Feb 7, 2014 | 3:25pm EST",Stock funds worldwide post record $28.3 billion outflow : BofA,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-investing-fundflows-bofa-idUSBREA1617F20140207?type=companyNews
40,"   By Deborah L. Cohen | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Like many financial advisers, Joseph Clemens of Denver has seen his clients wax enthusiastic about mutual funds from Vanguard, the company that put index-based investing and low-cost funds on the map.As the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index built a 30 percent return in 2013, investors flocked to the kind of investing the Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, fund powerhouse specializes in, called passive investing. In many cases, they have called their advisers asking to be put into Vanguard funds.""There has been a bull market in passive investing. Vanguard is king,"" Clemens said. One of every four U.S. dollars flowing into mutual funds last year was captured by Vanguard, according to a January report by the research firm Morningstar.Maybe that is because the average Vanguard mutual fund share class - excluding money market funds - costs 0.13 percent a year, compared with 1.15 percent for the rest of the industry, according to Lipper, a Thomson Reuters company.Clemens has no problem saying ""yes."" As a fee-based adviser whose clients' assets sit in Charles Schwab accounts, he is able to buy some Vanguard funds by paying transaction fees that typically are less than $10 per trade.But the Vanguard juggernaut can present problems for other kinds of advisers.It presents a particular challenge to traditional brokers, who make their money by earning commissions on the products they sell. Often their company trading platforms do not carry the full breadth of Vanguard funds, and brokers do not make money on the products they do offer when they encourage clients to buy them.TRADITIONAL BROKER WOES ""You can't compete on price with them,"" says one Morgan Stanley broker who declined to be named. When his clients request Vanguard funds, he typically offers alternatives with a similar investment approach, though they will cost more. If clients balk, he plays up the importance of the comprehensive service they receive from him on other investment choices.""Is Vanguard going to pick up the phone and call the client? Generally speaking, the answer is ‘no,'"" he says. ""With Vanguard, you're kind of on your own.""Some brokers offer workaround solutions to get their clients into Vanguard funds.One Merrill Lynch adviser, who also declined to be named, says he recommends that clients he thinks should have a Vanguard municipal bond fund buy it through Merrill Edge, Bank of America Corp's online discount brokerage site.Once the Edge account is open, the adviser then prompts the client to transfer the Vanguard funds to a regular Merrill account. He says firm officials have not questioned the procedure. OFFERING A TISSUE, NOT A KLEENEX David Shotwell, a fee-only adviser based in Ann Arbor, Michigan, whose firm manages $47 million, says he sometimes puts clients into Vanguard, but he often looks for comparable substitutes more readily available on the Fidelity platform he uses for his clients' accounts.""It's like saying you want a Kleenex when you need a tissue,"" Shotwell says. ""I approach it from the idea that they are not necessarily after Vanguard per se, but rather after a low-cost, passive-index approach. The trick is figuring out why they are asking for Vanguard and then looking at funds that provide those solutions.""EXCHANGE-TRADED FUNDS Besides offering its array of products to investors directly and through employee benefit plans, Vanguard makes most of its funds available through brokers and investment advisers at varying costs, says Jack Brod, a principal in the company's financial adviser services division. Independent advisers who clear trades through broker-dealer networks such as Fidelity may not have access to Vanguard mutual funds, but they can buy comparable Vanguard exchange traded funds (ETFs). Both ETFs and index mutual funds seek to track closely an index benchmark. ETFs can be even lower-cost than mutual funds though they typically require transaction costs; the market price for ETFs fluctuates throughout the day, while mutual fund shares are priced once after the close of trading.""If you buy a Vanguard ETF, you're going to pay a commission or transaction fee,"" says Brod, adding that Vanguard's business with advisers has been growing due to more advisers adopting a fee-based business model that does not require them to sell commissioned mutual funds. ""We do a significant ETF business.""Clemens, the Denver-based adviser, uses Vanguard ETFs for his clients, paying transaction costs of less than $10 per trade.LESS INVESTMENT PICKING, MORE PLANNING Of course, advisers who function strictly as planners and do not manage client money tend to be indifferent to the brands their clients request.

41,"   By Deborah L. Cohen | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Feb 7 Like many financial advisers, Joseph Clemens of Denver has seen his clients wax enthusiastic about mutual funds from Vanguard, the company that put index-based investing and low-cost funds on the map.As the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index built a 30 percent return in 2013, investors flocked to the kind of investing the Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, fund powerhouse specializes in, called passive investing. In many cases, they have called their advisers asking to be put into Vanguard funds.""There has been a bull market in passive investing. Vanguard is king,"" Clemens said. One of every four U.S. dollars flowing into mutual funds last year was captured by Vanguard, according to a January report by the research firm Morningstar.Maybe that is because the average Vanguard mutual fund share class - excluding money market funds - costs 0.13 percent a year, compared with 1.15 percent for the rest of the industry, according to Lipper, a Thomson Reuters company.Clemens has no problem saying ""yes."" As a fee-based adviser whose clients' assets sit in Charles Schwab accounts, he is able to buy some Vanguard funds by paying transaction fees that typically are less than $10 per trade.But the Vanguard juggernaut can present problems for other  kinds of advisers.It presents a particular challenge to traditional brokers, who make their money by earning commissions on the products they sell. Often their company trading platforms do not carry the full breadth of Vanguard funds, and brokers do not make money on the products they do offer when they encourage clients to buy them.TRADITIONAL BROKER WOES ""You can't compete on price with them,"" says one Morgan Stanley broker who declined to be named. When his clients request Vanguard funds, he typically offers alternatives with a similar investment approach, though they will cost more. If clients balk, he plays up the importance of the comprehensive service they receive from him on other investment choices.""Is Vanguard going to pick up the phone and call the client? Generally speaking, the answer is 'no,'"" he says. ""With Vanguard, you're kind of on your own.""Some brokers offer workaround solutions to get their clients into Vanguard funds.One Merrill Lynch adviser, who also declined to be named, says he recommends that clients he thinks should have a Vanguard municipal bond fund buy it through Merrill Edge, Bank of America Corp's online discount brokerage site.Once the Edge account is open, the adviser then prompts the client to transfer the Vanguard funds to a regular Merrill account. He says firm officials have not questioned the procedure. OFFERING A TISSUE, NOT A KLEENEX David Shotwell, a fee-only adviser based in Ann Arbor, Michigan, whose firm manages $47 million, says he sometimes puts clients into Vanguard, but he often looks for comparable substitutes more readily available on the Fidelity platform he uses for his clients' accounts.""It's like saying you want a Kleenex when you need a tissue,"" Shotwell says. ""I approach it from the idea that they are not necessarily after Vanguard per se, but rather after a low-cost, passive-index approach. The trick is figuring out why they are asking for Vanguard and then looking at funds that provide those solutions.""EXCHANGE-TRADED FUNDS  Besides offering its array of products to investors directly and through employee benefit plans, Vanguard makes most of its funds available through brokers and investment advisers at varying costs, says Jack Brod, a principal in the company's financial adviser services division.Independent advisers who clear trades through broker-dealer networks such as Fidelity may not have access to Vanguard mutual funds, but they can buy comparable Vanguard exchange traded funds (ETFs). Both ETFs and index mutual funds seek to track closely an index benchmark. ETFs can be even lower-cost than mutual funds though they typically require transaction costs; the market price for ETFs fluctuates throughout the day, while mutual fund shares are priced once after the close of trading.""If you buy a Vanguard ETF, you're going to pay a commission or transaction fee,"" says Brod, adding that Vanguard's business with advisers has been growing due to more advisers adopting a fee-based business model that does not require them to sell commissioned mutual funds. ""We do a significant ETF business.""Clemens, the Denver-based adviser, uses Vanguard ETFs for his clients, paying transaction costs of less than $10 per trade.LESS INVESTMENT PICKING, MORE PLANNING Of course, advisers who function strictly as planners and do not manage client money tend to be indifferent to the brands their clients request. Amy Jo Lauber, a fee-only financial planner outside of Buffalo, New York, often turns to Vanguard funds for her customers, many of whom are engineers.""Most of them are very much do-it-yourselfers,"" she says. ""Just tell them which funds and they'll go on the website and fill out the application themselves.""Whatever the approach to obtaining passive investment funds, it appears clients' interest in them is not waning, says Mike Rawson, the Morningstar analyst who authors the monthly fund flow reports.He notes there is at least one worthwhile outcome that financial advisers should take note of.

42,"  WASHINGTON A former Bank of America executive pleaded guilty on Monday to conspiring to defraud cities and towns, looking to invest proceeds for municipal bonds, the Justice Department said.Phillip Murphy, who was a managing director of Bank of America's municipal derivatives desk from 1998 to 2002, pleaded guilty to conspiring to make false entries in reports and other papers sent from his desk to bank management. The scheme ran from about 1998 to 2006.Bank of America Corp had agreed in December to pay $20 million to settle a lawsuit brought by the City of Baltimore and other plaintiffs, in which investors accused it of rigging bids for municipal securities, according to court papers.After selling bonds, municipalities park the proceeds in the interest-bearing contracts until they need the funds for work on the project they have financed. Some of the world's largest banks have been ensnared in an investigation into allegations that their employees decided in advance which investment house would win the auctions of these guaranteed investment contracts - essentially investments that cities and counties buy with proceeds from municipal bond sales.A total of 17 people, including Murphy, have been convicted in the probe or pleaded guilty. Bank of America said in a 2007 statement that it was cooperating with the Justice Department in the probe, and had won amnesty for that cooperation.

45,"   By Karen Freifeld | NEW YORK  NEW YORK A New York state judge declined to delay court approval of Bank of America Corp's (BAC.N) $8.5 billion settlement with investors in mortgage-backed securities, rejecting a move by American International Group Inc (AIG.N).At a hearing on Wednesday, Justice Saliann Scarpulla of New York State Supreme Court ordered the judgment by her predecessor in the case, Barbara Kapnick, to be officially recorded.""It's very straightforward,"" Scarpulla told lawyers for AIG, which was one of the investors in the mortgage securities. ""Judge Kapnick issued the order. ... If you don't like it, your remedy is to appeal.""Kapnick approved the settlement on January 31, her last day overseeing the case before she was elevated to a state appeals court, and ordered a five-day delay before her approval was officially recorded. AIG on February 4 asked Scarpulla, the new judge on the case, to delay recording of the judgment, saying Kapnick had left some matters unresolved.""Judge Kapnick told me the five-day stay she put in was merely a convenience to the parties,"" Scarpulla said on Wednesday. ""She had no intention of leaving anything open.""AIG said in a statement it will appeal Kapnick's decision if necessary. Bank of America agreed to the settlement in June 2011 to resolve claims by investors who bought mortgage-backed securities issued by Countrywide Financial before the U.S. housing crisis. The investors said Countrywide, acquired by Bank of America in 2008, misrepresented the quality of the underlying home mortgages, which went sour in the crisis.Twenty-two institutional investors, including BlackRock Inc (BLK.N), Allianz SE's Pimco (ALVG.DE) and Metlife Inc (MET.N), signed on to the settlement. AIG opposed the deal, saying there was no evidence it provided adequate compensation for losses.""AIG's announced strategy of imposing indefinite delay was defeated today,"" Kathy Patrick, a lawyer for the investor group supporting the decision, told Reuters.Lawrence Grayson, a spokesman for Bank of America, declined to comment. Kevin Heine, a spokesman for Bank of New York Mellon, the trustee overseeing the securities, said it was pleased the court will enter the judgment, ""which overwhelmingly vindicated the trustee's actions.""Bank of New York Mellon and other supporters of the deal have accused AIG of holding the settlement ""hostage.""In her January 31 ruling, Kapnick said Bank of New York Mellon acted with mostly reasonable judgment in entering into the settlement. She made one exception, withholding approval relating to certain loans that had been modified. She said the trustee should not have settled those claims without investigating their potential worth. AIG said Wednesday it will try to get Kapnick's decision vacated by pursuing a motion it filed Tuesday to reargue the case before Scarpulla.In the motion, AIG said Kapnick overlooked disputed and unresolved issues, applied the wrong standard to the trustee's actions and failed to adequately explain her decision.""We are pleased that the court intends to address AIG's motion for re-argument,"" AIG said in its statement. ""If necessary, AIG also looks forward to pressing ahead with its appeal at the appropriate time.""Scarpulla said during the hearing she would hear arguments on the motion but did not set a date.The case is In re Bank of New York Mellon, New York State Supreme Court, New York County, No. 651786/2011.(Reporting by Karen Freifeld; Editing by Leslie Adler and Chizu Nomiyama)",2014-02-19,BAC,"Wed Feb 19, 2014 | 3:46pm EST",BofA $8.5 billion deal to go forward; AIG loses bid to delay,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-bankofamerica-mbs-settlement-idUSBREA1I1SW20140219?type=companyNews
46,"  NEW YORK Fund investors worldwide poured $13.4 billion into stock funds in the week ended February 19 on confidence that stocks could head higher, data from a Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global Research report showed on Friday.The inflows into stock funds in the week were the biggest in 12 weeks, according to the report, which also cited data from fund-tracker EPFR Global. Investors pulled $45 billion out of money market funds, meanwhile, marking their biggest outflows since last October.The inflows marked the third straight week of new demand for stock funds. Funds that specialize in U.S. stocks attracted $8.3 billion of the net inflows into stock funds, with most of the cash flowing into exchange-traded funds. ETFs are thought to represent the behavior of institutional investors.The inflows into stock funds and outflows from money market funds, which typically invest in safe short-term securities, underscored investors' appetite for risk in the latest week and confidence that stock markets could gain in the near-term.""The expected return from stocks is positive over the next 12 months,"" said Robert Stein, global head of asset management at Astor Asset Management in Chicago.The benchmark Standard & Poor's 500 stock index rose 0.5 percent over the weekly period. Stocks rose during most of the week after investors blamed weak U.S. retail sales and homebuilder confidence data on frigid weather. ""The data was not the type of weak U.S. economic data that would change the path for equities in the long run,"" Stein of Astor Asset Management said.He said investors viewed the worst to be over in stock markets. The S&P 500 stock index fell nearly 3 percent between January 30-February 3 on mixed U.S. economic data and concerns of a protracted capital flight out of emerging markets.The latest weekly gain in U.S. stocks came despite a dip in stock markets on Wednesday after the minutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve's most recent meeting showed members supported continued tapering of the central bank's bond-buying program. U.S. markets were closed Monday for Presidents Day. Investors continued to favor funds that hold European stocks, which attracted $4.5 billion in new cash, marking their 34th straight week of inflows. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares rose 0.9 percent over the weekly period.Investors still showed an aversion to emerging market stocks and pulled $1.5 billion out of emerging market stock funds, extending the funds' record outflow streak to 17 weeks. The outflows came despite a modest 0.6 percent rise in MSCI's global emerging market stocks index.While stock funds attracted the most new cash, bond funds attracted $2.6 billion, marking their third straight week of inflows and showing some investors' preference for safety. Still, investors' risk appetite resulted in inflows of $2.4 billion into funds that specialize in riskier high-yield junk bonds, marking their biggest inflows in 17 weeks.""Investors are looking for income and there has been good performance in high-yield,"" said Brian Rehling, chief fixed income strategist at Wells Fargo Advisors in St. Louis.The Barclays U.S. Corporate High Yield index has gained 1.9 percent so far this year, beating the benchmark Barclays U.S. Aggregate bond index's gain of 1.41 percent.The yield on the safe-haven 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell 3 basis points to 2.73 percent over the weekly period in response to the weak U.S. economic data.

Blackstone and Biomet did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Representatives for TPG, KKR and the banks declined to comment.Founded in 1977, and based in Warsaw, Indiana, Biomet designs, manufacturers and markets products that include dental implants and artificial hips joints. Biomet competes with Smith & Nephew PLC and Stryker Corp (SYK.N). Biomet's buyout was done at the top of the market. But since then the medical device industry was hit during the financial crisis as patients delayed surgery and joint replacements. Pricing pressure for hip and knee replacements has also impacted the sector.Biomet is one of the few remaining large companies taken over by private equity firms during the buyout boom that has not yet gone public. Other large private equity-owned companies that have gone public in the past 12 months include hotel chain Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc (HLT.N), oil and gas company Antero Resources Corp (AR.N) and industrials supply company HD Supply Holdings Inc (HDS.O).Biomet's sales topped $3 billion in the fiscal year ended May 31, 2013, up 8 percent from the previous year.

60,"  NEW YORK Investors worldwide poured $7.5 billion into stock funds in the week ended March 5 on reassuring signs the U.S. economy was on firm footing and reduced geopolitical tensions, data from a Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global Research report showed Friday.Inflows in the week ended Wednesday marked the fourth straight week of new cash into the funds, according to the report, which also cited data from fund tracker EPFR Global.""People are growing sanguine about global growth,"" said Chris Konstantinos, head of international portfolio management at RiverFront Investment Group in Richmond, Virginia.The net inflows into stock funds showed investors' conviction that stocks, which hit record highs over the weekly period, could continue to rally on a stronger U.S. economy.The Standard & Poor's 500 stock index hit records and rose 1.6 percent over the weekly period on some strong U.S. economic data. It was also helped by comments from Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen that cold weather was behind recent weakness in the U.S. economy, and by reduced fears of armed conflict between Russian and Ukraine.Meanwhile, investors pulled $3.8 billion from emerging market stock funds, extending those funds' record outflow streak to 19 weeks. Japanese stock funds posted $400 million in outflows, their first withdrawals this year. MSCI's index of global emerging market stocks rose 0.3 percent over the period, despite being hit by the tensions in Russia and Ukraine. Japan's Nikkei average fell 0.5 percent over the period.""The market is voting with its feet about the types of structural headwinds emerging markets face,"" said Konstantinos, adding the Fed's expected taper of asset purchases, and lower Chinese growth, are negative for emerging market stocks.Funds that specialize in European stocks attracted $600 million, their smallest inflows in 16 weeks, but extending their inflow streak to 36 weeks. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares fell 0.4 percent over the weekly period. Russia's intervention in Ukraine sent the index down 2.2 percent on March 3.Investors pulled $1.8 billion from bond funds, their first outflows in five weeks, but they showed risk appetite by committing $1.9 billion to funds that specialize in high-yield junk bonds, marking the fourth straight week of inflows. High-yield corporate bonds have lower credit ratings than investment-grade bonds, and tend to attract inflows alongside other riskier assets such as stocks. ""When investors see the broader market perform well, it gives them confidence to take added risk,"" said Rick Meckler, president of LibertyView Capital Management in New Jersey.Funds that mainly hold U.S. Treasuries posted $8.8 billion in outflows, mostly from the iShares 1-3 Year Treasury Bond ETF, the iShares 3-7 Year Treasury Bond ETF and the ProShares UltraShort 20- plus Year Treasury ETF.Meckler said a limited set of investors likely caused the ETF outflows and the withdrawals did not represent broader bond investor sentiment.Low-risk money market funds posted $16 billion in outflows, underscoring investors' willingness to put cash to work in riskier assets.

""It may be there is logic to the $2.1 billion, but at least to me there is logic under your theory of the case that would lead you to claim a gross gain of $5 billion.""Assistant U.S. Attorney Pierre Armand, meanwhile, suggested the government would increase its request for penalties from Rebecca Mairone, a former Countrywide executive, from $1.1 million to $1.6 million based on a $487,000 bonus she recently earned from her employer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.The hearing followed a verdict by a federal jury in New York in October finding Bank of America and Mairone each liable for fraud in a civil lawsuit centered on a mortgage lending process at Countrywide called the ""High Speed Swim Lane,"" also called ""HSSL"" or ""Hustle."" Countrywide, which became a poster child for the U.S. mortgage meltdown, was acquired by Bank of America in July 2008.The Justice Department contends that the Countrywide program, which began in 2007 and which the government says Mairone oversaw, emphasized quantity rather than the quality of loans produced, paying employees based on volume and speed and eliminating loan-quality checkpoints.Bank of America and Mairone deny wrongdoing.

64,"   By Nate Raymond and Aruna Viswanatha | NEW YORK/WASHINGTON  NEW YORK/WASHINGTON The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp sued 16 of the world's largest banks on Friday, accusing them of cheating dozens of other now defunct banks by manipulating the Libor interest rate.The global financial institutions broke certain swaps contracts they had entered into with the now-closed banks, by separately colluding to rig the Libor rate to which the contracts were tied, the FDIC said.Some of the banks accused in the lawsuit, including Barclays Plc and UBS, have already paid some $6 billion to resolve charges from U.S. and European authorities that they worked to manipulate benchmark interest rates.They have also been sued by investors and others who claim they lost money due to the manipulation. A federal judge last March dismissed many of those claims that were based on antitrust law, but has yet to rule on cases that rely on the ""breach of contract"" theory used by the FDIC.""These look very much like claims that I think are going to have a much better chance with the court,"" said Daniel Brockett, a lawyer with Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan who had brought other cases against banks over Libor manipulation. A representative of the FDIC declined comment. Representatives of the banks declined comment or did not respond to a request for comment.Libor, which is the average rate that a panel of banks say they can borrow unsecured funds, has become a key rate globally, underpinning more than $550 trillion in financial products, from home loans to derivatives.""SUBSTANTIAL LOSSES""  The financial institutions' conduct caused ""substantial losses"" to 38 banks that the U.S. regulator had taken into receivership since 2008, including Washington Mutual Bank and IndyMac Bank, the FDIC said.The regulator did not quantify the losses at issue. The lawsuit also did not specify what damages the FDIC is seeking.The lawsuit also accused the British Bankers' Association, the U.K. trade organization that during the period at issue administered Libor, of participating in the scheme. The BBA had said it independently monitored the banks' Libor submissions, and represented that Libor was a ""transparent"" benchmark, even though it knew those statements were false, the FDIC said. A representative of the BBA declined comment.The banks named as defendants include Bank of America Corp, Citigroup Inc, Credit Suisse Group AG, Deutsche Bank AG, HSBC Holdings PLC, JPMorgan Chase & Co, and Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC.Other defendants in the lawsuit are Rabobank, Lloyds Banking Group plc, Societe Generale, Norinchukin Bank, Royal Bank of Canada, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ and WestLB AG.The case is Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, et al, v.

66,"  By John WasikCHICAGO, March 17You can get most of what you want for your investments from off-the-shelf index funds, but you may have to dig deeper to make your portfolio more productive.For most mainstream investors, a focus on S&P 500 index funds and a general bond market index serves them well. Yet what if you concentrated on a mixture of different asset classes instead of only picking the usual suspects in conventional index funds that hold the most popular stocks and bonds? You may be able to boost returns while insulating yourself from off years.An ""asset-class investing"" approach still relies upon low-cost, passively managed funds as core vehicles, but it puts a greater focus on diversification, which could enhance returns. Giving yourself a piece of every corner of the market means investing in large-, medium- and small-sized companies in developed and emerging markets, plus a broad selection of U.S. and global bonds.How does it differ? Take the standard approach to indexing the U.S. stock market. Most financial advisers would tell you to buy an S&P index fund, which holds the most popular stocks in the U.S. A good choice would be the SPDR S&P 500 ETF, which holds a mostly passive portfolio at an expense ratio of 0.09 percent annually.Since many index funds hold stocks that investors have assigned the highest values to, you may not be getting the best prices on them.What if you shifted to a value approach, and sought bargain-priced stocks?Then you'd want to buy a fund like the DFA US Large Cap Value I fund, which has beaten the S&P 500 index by almost 4 percentage points in annualized return over the past 15 years through March 14. Charging 0.27 percent for annual expenses, the fund has top holdings like Bank of America Corp , Citigroup Inc and Chevron Corp. Over the last three years, it's posted an annualized return of nearly 16 percent through March 14. With this approach, you may realize more upside because these companies aren't valued as highly as companies like Apple Inc and ExxonMobil Corp, which top the popularity contest for U.S. stocks at the moment and sit on top of the holdings for most big-stock index funds.Another aspect of the asset-class approach is to spread your stock allocation across companies of all sizes throughout the world. Combining a value and small-company stake can also be potent.Over time, the return advantage of small-cap value over the S&P 500 index is impressive.The DFA US Small Cap Value Portfolio, for example, has outperformed the S&P index by more than 8 percentage points in annualized returns over the past 15 years. But you probably wouldn't recognize most of the holdings of this fund, which include companies like CNO Financial Group Inc and Esterline Technologies Corp.  It costs 0.52 percent annually in expenses. THE BIG PICTURE If there is one theme in asset class investing, it's ignoring what's popular at the time - whether it's a fund or a stock - and hewing to a broad picture of the entire universe of stocks and bonds.Assuming that the mix of funds matches your stomach for risk and can beat inflation, pulling everything together is a matter of finding the best funds in each asset class. DFA funds, which I've cited above, are good vehicles, but are only available through advisers. You can find comparable funds within the iShares, SPDR or Vanguard Groups.Eric Nelson of Servo Management in Oklahoma City employs asset class investing for his clients. His approach is mostly passive, but he tailors each portfolio.Part of the strategy is holding funds that are sagging at the moment, like emerging markets or large-company value. This approach may also entail lower risk since you're not over-concentrated in the highest-priced stocks on the market.Nelson estimates that asset-class investing has returned about 8 percent annually over the past decade, through February, compared to 6 percent for active management and 7 percent for a ""tactical"" strategy that bounces between hot and cold sectors.""Asset class investing is customized to what you are trying to accomplish,"" Nelson says. ""And there's no benefit in buying actively managed funds.""The other key element in the strategy is to be true to the kind of risk you want to take. The trade-off for investing in small companies looking for high return is that they involve more risk in the short term. That's where diversification comes in. By investing in a wide mix of stocks and bonds, Nelson's asset-class portfolio lost only 22 percent in 2008, compared to about 32 percent for active portfolios.Making this strategy work might entail working with an adviser to set up a portfolio of low-cost passive funds or finding a pre-designed portfolio online from services such as Betterment, Wealthfront.com, folioinvesting.com. Just make sure that you have a piece of everything: Large, medium and small companies across the globe and bonds from the U.S. Treasury, corporations, and emerging markets.",2014-03-17,BAC,"Mon Mar 17, 2014 | 11:55am EDT",COLUMN-Drop the S&P index fund for asset-class investing,http://www.reuters.com//article/column-wasik-idUSL2N0ME0R920140317?type=companyNews

68,"  * Vorlop named to head products and advice* Nadreau running business strategy* Wells' brokerage subsidiary promises brokers technology improvementsBy Jed HorowitzNEW YORK, March 19 Mary Mack, the new retail brokerage boss at Wells Fargo Advisors, has elevated Bob Vorlop to head of products and advice for the firm's more than 11,000 brokers as she fills out her management team.The position is a new one, created when Mack in February split in half the financial services group that creates tools and products for the brokers. At the time, she named Joe Nadreau, 43, to run innovation and business strategy and said the products role would be filled soon. Mack, who became president of the Wells Fargo & Co broker-dealer subsidiary in January following the retirement of long-time brokerage head Danny Ludeman, also plans to name an executive to head a new Mobile and Online Group, a spokeswoman said.Mack previously ran the combined unit at Wells Advisors, which is the third-largest brokerage firm in the United States, as measured by number of financial advisers.Vorlop, 56, oversees brokers' sale of loans and other banking products, an area of growing importance as bank-owned brokers such as Wells, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and UBS Wealth Management Americas attempt to sell products of their parent companies in addition to investment products. His group also oversees investment services and recruiting of brokers and branch managers. Vorlop, who has been with Wells Fargo and predecessor brokerage firms such as Wachovia Securities for 30 years, had most recently run investment and advisory products.Nadreau's innovation and business strategy group creates and manages processes and platforms that brokers use.  Nadreau and Vorlop also have joined the broker-dealer's executive committee. Like its competitors, Wells Fargo has been pouring money into new technology to make its products and services more accessible to clients and brokers. Wells' brokerage group has grown through a series of acquisitions that left it with numerous systems and workstations that did not always communicate effectively.In an internal email to brokers last month, David Kowach, president of the branch-based private client group, said he has heard their complaints about poor technology and inefficient services and is addressing them. Improvements range from new scanners in all branches that he promised will eliminate ""the frustration and inefficiency"" of using faxes for service request for things like issuing checks and moving money to an upgrade of brokers' computer workstations to allow them to simultaneously see accounts of multiple clients.Wells next quarter will roll out an iPad application that will let advisers access relevant client information remotely for in-person visits.Kowach also promised that in late 2014 or early 2015, Wells will roll out a ""360 Degree View of the Client"" that allows brokers to see in a single location what clients own across all their accounts, all relevant information about their goals and other crucial information.""Today our client information is all over the place - and that's been a big point of frustration that I've heard from you,"" Kowach wrote in the memo seen by Reuters. ""Through the years, we've essentially quilted together a lot of different systems.""

71,"   By Douwe Miedema | WASHINGTON, March 21  WASHINGTON, March 21 The U.S. derivatives regulator on Friday gave European trading platforms more time to register and meet strict new rules to make the market more transparent, in anticipation of comparable rules abroad.The delay was issued by the agency in a so-called no-action letter after an agreement the Commodity Futures Trading Commission struck with the European Union in February, which will in practice affect firms in London only.The CFTC at the time said it expected the UK's Financial Conduct Authority to have rules comparable to its own in place by March 24, and that foreign companies would be granted relief from its rules, if they so requested. The platforms to trade swaps now have until May 14 to register, or so much earlier as the agency finds they have signed up with a European regulator with comparable rules.The CFTC also said it would adjust the conditions companies would have to meet, and that it would elaborate on that in another statement expected next week. The CFTC last year publicly argued with the European Union as it sought broad sway over foreign companies doing business with U.S. clients or trading out of U.S. offices. It has also been sued by U.S. banks over so-called cross-border rules. The banks argue that the United States has no jurisdiction over what they do abroad.The February decision had been anticipated by London firms, which do the bulk of the business with U.S. banks. Only swaps broker ICAP had sent in registration paperwork for its London unit to avoid any risk of noncompliance.The $630 trillion global swaps market, which was at the center of the 2007-09 financial crisis, is dominated by large investment banks such as Bank of America, JP Morgan Chase & Co and Citigroup.

72,"   By Margaret Chadbourn and Aruna Viswanatha | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Bank of America agreed to pay $9.3 billion to settle claims that it sold Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac faulty mortgage bonds, helping the bank to end one of the largest legal headaches it still faced from the financial crisis.The settlement, announced on Wednesday, includes $6.3 billion in cash and $3.2 billion in securities that Bank of America will purchase from the two housing finance entities.The second-largest U.S. bank by assets said it had now resolved around 88 percent of its total exposure to securities at issue in the mortgage bond litigation it has faced.Bank of America's first-quarter profits could take a substantial hit from the deal. The bank said the settlement is expected to reduce first-quarter income by about 21 cents per share, or three-quarters of what analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S forecasted the bank to earn before the settlement was announced.Also on Wednesday the bank agreed to pay $15 million to resolve a long-running lawsuit from the New York Attorney General over its 2009 acquisition of Merrill Lynch & Co.It still faces a lawsuit from the U.S. Justice Department and several other probes by the DOJ and states over mortgage-backed securities it sold during the housing boom. On Wednesday the bank said it has had ""preliminary discussions"" to resolve the matters. ""REASONABLE AND PRUDENT"" The new settlement with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac resolves lawsuits filed against Bank of America, Merrill Lynch, and Countrywide, the subprime mortgage lender it bought at the height of the financial crisis.The regulator of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, had accused the bank of misrepresenting the quality of loans underlying residential mortgage-backed securities purchased by the two mortgage finance companies between 2005 and 2007.

74,"   By Karen Freifeld | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Kenneth Lewis, who turned Bank of America Corp into the nation's largest bank but also saddled it with enormous losses tied to mortgages, has settled a lawsuit accusing him of deceiving investors about one of his biggest acquisitions: Merrill Lynch & Co.Lewis, the bank's chief executive from 2001 to 2009, will pay $10 million to resolve claims by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman that he misled shareholders and the government in order to complete the merger, which closed on January 1, 2009, according to a copy of the agreement obtained by Reuters.New York accused Lewis of concealing Merrill's mounting losses from Bank of America shareholders prior to a December 5, 2008 vote on the merger, and manipulating the U.S. government into providing an extra $20 billion bailout by falsely claiming that he would back out of the merger without the money.As part of the agreement, Lewis, 66, will also be barred for three years from serving as an officer or director of a public company. A spokeswoman for Lewis's attorney said the bank would cover his payment.Bank of America will pay $15 million to resolve its portion of the lawsuit by Schneiderman, who inherited the case from his predecessor, Andrew Cuomo, now New York's governor. The bank also will adopt reforms, such as creating a special committee to review large acquisitions, according to a separate settlement agreement obtained by Reuters.Both payments would cover the costs of Schneiderman's investigation, and neither Lewis nor Bank of America are admitting wrongdoing or paying damages.Nonetheless, the settlement with Lewis, who has kept a low public profile since leaving Bank of America, would mark one of the rare times that an executive at a major U.S. bank has been held legally responsible in a case alleging wrongful conduct linked to the 2008 global financial crisis.""Individuals - not just corporations - should be held accountable for their actions,"" Schneiderman said in a statement confirming the settlements.Attorney Bruce Yannett, who represents Lewis, said in a statement that the former executive was pleased to put the case behind him. ""Mr. Lewis is proud of the role he played in helping the U.S. banking system survive a very challenging period in its history,"" the statement said.""The bank relied on experienced legal counsel ... with regard to what needed to be disclosed to shareholders,"" the statement said, adding that the Merrill acquisition has proven an ""unmitigated success"" for Bank of America.A spokesman for Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America, now the second-largest U.S. bank by assets, declined to comment.A third defendant, former Bank of America chief financial officer Joe Price, has yet to settle.""We understand the bank and Ken Lewis ... have accepted terms from the New York attorney general to put the matter behind them,"" said Price's lawyer, William Jeffress. ""Joe Price made a different decision and we continue to defend the case."" RED INK Bank of America agreed to buy Merrill Lynch for an estimated $50 billion on September 15, 2008, the day before Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc went bankrupt, in a hurried merger that won Lewis praise at the time and likely prevented Merrill's demise.Losses at Merrill, however, mounted ahead of a December 5, 2008 vote by Bank of America shareholders on the merger, ultimately reaching $15.84 billion in the fourth quarter of that year.Despite the red ink, Merrill paid out $3.62 billion of bonuses, and New York claimed that Bank of America misled shareholders about the timing and criteria for the payouts.The merger closed six months after Lewis had bought the mortgage lender Countrywide Financial Corp. The two purchases put great stress on Bank of America's balance sheet, and led to an extra $20 billion federal bailout in mid-January, by which time Merrill's losses also became known. The bank had already taken $25 billion from the government. The $45 billion has since been repaid. MARTIN ACT Cuomo had sued Lewis, Price and Bank of America under the Martin Act, the state's powerful securities fraud statute.The lawsuit came after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had also sued Bank of America over its disclosures about Merrill's losses and bonuses.That case eventually settled for $150 million, an accord that U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan approved reluctantly because it did not require Bank of America to address whether it did anything wrong.A separate $2.43 billion shareholder class action settlement won final approval last year, and was a factor in Schneiderman's decision in January to drop his damages claim.New York's highest court ruled in 2008 that the attorney general cannot pursue damages for shareholders who have settled a class action, even if they are not made whole.Bank of America was surpassed as the largest U.S. bank by assets by JPMorgan Chase & Co in 2011.The case is New York v.

76,"  WASHINGTON, March 26 Bank of America  will pay $9.3 billion to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac  to settle claims that it sold them faulty mortgage-backed securities during the housing bubble, a U.S. regulator said on Wednesday.

77,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, March 26 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Bank of America  Corporation's (BAC) Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A' and revised the  Rating Outlook to Negative from Stable. At the same time, Fitch affirmed BAC's  Short-Term IDR at 'F1', Viability Rating (VR) at 'a-', Support Rating (SR) at  '1', and Support Rating Floor (SRF) at 'A'. A full list of rating actions,  including actions on BAC's main subsidiaries and debt ratings, is at the end of  this rating action commentary. The revision of the Outlook on BAC's support-driven Long-term IDR to Negative  reflects Fitch's expectation that the probability that the bank would receive  support from the U.S. government if ever required is likely to decline within  one to two years. Therefore, Fitch expects to revise BAC's Support Rating to '5'  and its SRF to 'No Floor' within the next one to two years, likely to be at some  point in late 2014 or in 1H15.  The rating actions have been taken in conjunction with a review of support for  banks globally and also as part of a periodic review of the Global Trading and  Universal Banks (GTUBs), which comprise 12 large and globally active banking  groups. Fitch's outlook for the sector is stable on balance. Earnings pressure  in securities businesses, particularly in fixed income, and continued conduct  and regulatory risks present in the GTUBs are offset by stronger balance sheets  as capitalisation and liquidity remain sound. Fitch forecasts stronger GDP  growth in most economies, which should contribute to a more balanced economic  environment, but the economic environment is likely to remain challenging in  2014. Today's rating actions assume that BAC will perform adequately under the CCAR  stress test, though Fitch has no visibility into any potential qualitative  rejections for BAC, or any of the other 29 banks subject to regulatory stress  testing. Although a qualitative rejection of a capital plan request under CCAR  would be viewed negatively by Fitch, it is not expected to have any rating  implications for BAC. KEY RATING DRIVERS - IDRS, SENIOR DEBT, SR AND SRF  BAC's Long and Short-term IDRs, SR and Support Rating Floor SRF reflect Fitch's  expectation that there remains an extremely high probability of support from the  U.S. government ('AAA'/Stable Outlook) if required. This expectation reflects  the U.S.'s extremely high ability to support its banks especially given its  strong financial flexibility, though propensity is becoming less certain.  Specific to BAC, Fitch's view of support likelihood is based mostly on its  systemic importance in the U.S., its global interconnectedness given its size  and operations in global capital markets, significant deposit market share and  its position as a key provider of financial services to the U.S. economy. BAC's  IDRs and senior debt ratings benefit from support because BAC's VR is below its  SRF. The Negative Outlook on BAC's Long-term IDR reflects Fitch's view that there is  a clear intention to reduce support for G-SIFIs in the U.S., as demonstrated by  the Dodd Frank Act (DFA) and progress regulators have made on implementing the  Orderly Liquidation Authority (OLA). The FDIC has proposed its single point of  entry (SPOE) strategy and further initiatives are demonstrating the U.S.  government's progress to eliminate state support for U.S. banks going forward,  which increases the likelihood of senior debt losses if its banks run afoul of  solvency assessments.  KEY RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES - IDRS, SENIOR DEBT, SR AND SRF As BAC's Long-term IDR is at its SRF and Fitch does not expect any upward  momentum in its VR during the typical Outlook horizon, the sensitivities of its  IDR's are predominantly the same as those for the SRF. The SR and SRF are  sensitive to progress made in finalizing the SPOE strategy and any additional  regulatory initiatives that may be imposed on the G-SIFIs, including debt  thresholds at the holding company. Fitch's assessment of continuing support for  U.S. G-SIFIs has to some extent relied upon the feasibility of OLA  implementation rather than its enactment into law (when DFA passed). Hurdles  that remain include the resolution of how cross-border derivative  acceleration/termination provisions are handled and that there is sufficient  contingent capital at the holding company to recapitalize without requiring  government assistance.  Fitch expects that the SPOE strategy and regulatory action to ensure sufficient  contingent capital will be finalized in the near term. However, regardless of  when it finalizes, Fitch believes that sufficient regulatory progress continues  to be made over the ratings time horizon. Therefore, Fitch expects to revise  BAC's Support Rating to '5' and its SRF to 'No Floor' within the next one to two  years, likely to be some point in late 2014 or in 1H15. A revision of the SRF to 'No Floor' would mean BAC's Long-term IDR and senior  debt ratings would likely be downgraded to the level of its VR, which as it  currently stands would mean a one notch downgrade to 'A-'. After a revision of  the SRF, the Long-term IDR and the Outlook would be sensitive to the same  factors as its VR. BAC's Short-term IDR of 'F1' would not necessarily be  affected by the support actions discussed above. Fitch's rating criteria does  allow for entities with IDRs of 'A-' to have a short-term rating of 'F1'   KEY RATING DRIVERS - VR BAC's VR continues to be supported by strong capital and liquidity positions, as  well as a slowly improving earnings profile. BAC also continues to make  substantial progress in resolving its legacy litigation risks, all of which  continue to strengthen the firm's credit profile. To this end, BAC recently received approval from the Supreme Court of New York  for its $8.5 billion private label residential mortgage backed securities (PLS)  with Bank of New York Mellon (BK) as trustee. Reserves for this $8.5 billion  settlement as well as an incremental $100 million of litigation costs had  already been taken, so Fitch does not anticipate an impact on capital or  liquidity once the company begins to make settlement payments. Fitch views the  approval of this settlement as a positive for BAC. This settlement has been appealed by certain parties and others, namely American  International Group (AIG), may still file an appeal. However, given this ruling  from the court as well as the improving performance of many of the PLS causing  some litigants to drop their objection to the settlement, Fitch would expect the  incremental liability from a potential appeal to be much lower for  BAC than it  would have been previously. BAC's largest remaining legacy litigation exposure is in both New York and  California related to Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) PLS claims. In a  prior special report, based on settlement rates for other institutions, Fitch  estimated that FHFA litigation losses could total between $5 billion and $8  billion. With the BK as trustee settlement approved, it is likely that BAC's  FHFA losses can be managed within the context of current earnings forecasts and  existing capital ratios. BAC's earnings profile continues to improve, though the Fitch calculated (which  exclude CVA/DVA adjustments and various other gains/charges) pre-tax return on  assets (ROA) of 0.82% over the last two quarters was aided by substantial  reserve releases in each of the last two quarters. Without the large reserve  releases, BAC's Fitch calculated ROA would have remained well below some large  peer banks, which is important because Fitch expects reserve releases to  moderate over the course of 2014 primarily due to more modest increases in home  prices nationally and BAC's more moderate level of reserves. BAC has a number of strong franchises within its mix of businesses, whose  earning power could, over time, begin to emerge as BAC continues to wind down  its legacy litigation exposures and reduce its overall cost structure. To the  extent that management is able to achieve its cost reduction initiatives over an  intermediate to long-term time horizon, BAC's core earnings performance could be  more consistent with peer GTUB banks and the company's long-term cost of equity  assumption. BAC's VR continues to be supported by strong liquidity and a good capital  position as the company focuses on improving earnings performance.  As of the end of 2013, BAC's time to required funding was strong at 38 months,  and Fitch believes BAC's Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) would be comfortably  above current regulatory guidance. Additionally, BAC's Basel III Tier One  Capital (CET1) ratio under the advanced approach was stable at 9.96%. In  addition, BAC estimates that it would be in compliance with the proposed  supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) requirements at the holding company as well  as its two main bank subsidiaries in the U.S., Bank of America, N.A. and FIA  Card Services, N.A. KEY RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES - VR Longer-term positive rating momentum for the VR is predicated on a consistent  improvement in overall earnings to at least levels of other G-SIFI institutions,  all while maintaining ample liquidity and a good capital position Notwithstanding the impact of the reserve releases noted above on recent  earnings performance, BAC's core earnings have also been moderately volatile on  a quarterly basis given the company's large reliance on capital markets  activities. Capital markets revenue currently approximates one-third of overall  revenue, and was somewhat weak in the third quarter of 2013 (3Q13) but  substantially improved in the typically slow fourth quarter of 2013 (4Q13). Over time, the capital markets businesses contribution to earnings could decline  and therefore add some stability to overall earnings should management be able  to execute on improving performance in the company's retail banking business as  well as maintain its strong performance in wealth management. This could be a  positive rating factor over a longer-term time horizon. Should remaining litigation exposures or other unforeseen charges result in a  significant net earnings loss in excess of Fitch's stressed scenarios, or if the  company's regulatory or tangible capital ratios begin to meaningfully decline  over a near-to-intermediate term time horizon, the VR could be downgraded. While  it is not expected that BAC's overall credit quality will materially deteriorate  over the near term, should the company experience a severe risk management  failure this could negatively impact the VR. KEY RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES - LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS BAC's uninsured deposit ratings are rated one notch higher than the company's  IDR and senior unsecured debt because U.S. uninsured deposits benefit from  depositor preference. U.S. depositor preference gives deposit liabilities  superior recovery prospects in the event of default. The ratings of long and short-term deposits issued by BAC and its subsidiaries  are primarily sensitive to any change in BAC's IDR. This means that should BAC's  Long-term IDR be downgraded due to Fitch's evolving view of support discussed  above, deposit ratings could be similarly impacted.  KEY RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES - SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID  SECURITIES Subordinated debt and other hybrid capital issued by BAC and by various issuing  vehicles are all notched down from BAC's or its bank subsidiaries' VRs in  accordance with Fitch's assessment of each instrument's respective  non-performance and relative loss severity risk profiles.  The ratings of subordinated debt and other hybrid capital issued by BAC and its  subsidiaries are primarily sensitive to any change in BAC's VR.  KEY RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES - HOLDING COMPANY BAC's IDR and VR are equalized with those ratings of its operating companies and  banks, reflecting its role as the bank holding company, which is mandated in the  U.S. to act as a source of strength for its bank subsidiaries. It has modest  double leverage. Should BACs' holding company become under-capitalized or have cash flow coverage  of less than 18 months to meet obligations, there is the potential that Fitch  could notch the holding company IDR and VR from the ratings of the operating  companies. KEY RATING DRIVERS - SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANY The IDRs and VRs of BAC's bank subsidiaries benefit from the cross-guarantee  mechanism in the U.S. under FIRREA and therefore IDRs and VRs of Bank of  America, N.A., Bank of America Georgia, Bank of America Rhode Island, N.A., FIA  Card Services N.A., LaSalle Bank N.A., United States Trust Company N.A., are  equalised across the group. Fitch regards BAC's investment banking and  broker-dealer entities such as Merrill Lynch & Co. Inc. and related entities and  Bank of America Merrill Lynch International Ltd to be core entities for BAC and  thus IDRs equalized and linked to BAC.  Fitch views BAC's MBNA Limited subsidiary's ratings to be strategically  important for BAC and thus IDRs of this entity are one notch lower than BAC's  IDR in accordance with Fitch's rating criteria. As the IDRs and VRs of the subsidiaries are equalised with those of BAC to  reflect support from their ultimate parent, they are sensitive to changes in the  parent's propensity to provide support, which Fitch currently does not expect,  or from changes in BAC's IDRs.  To the extent that one of BAC's subsidiary or affiliated companies is not  considered to be a core business, Fitch could also notch the subsidiary's rating  from BAC's IDR. BAC is one of the largest U.S. banks in terms of total deposits, loans,  branches, mortgage originations/servicing and credit card issuance. Following  its January 2009 merger with Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc., BAC also became one of  the top financial institutions in wealth management and investment banking.

78,"   By Karen Freifeld and Jonathan Stempel  A federal judge has recommended dismissal of a U.S. government lawsuit accusing Bank of America Corp of defrauding investors into buying about $855 million of mortgage securities that soured during the global financial crisis.If it stands, Thursday's ruling by U.S. Magistrate Judge David Cayer in Charlotte, North Carolina could mark a serious setback for the U.S. Department of Justice in its effort to fight fraud in the sale of mortgage securities.Cayer said the government fell short of demonstrating that any false statements the bank may have made were material, or that the governing law covered the securities sales.Less than two hours later, the Justice Department filed court papers saying it plans to object to Cayer's findings.The lawsuit, which sought civil penalties, was a product of President Obama's Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities Working Group, which includes the Justice Department and other federal and state regulators.It is one of several in which the government has relied on a law adopted after the 1980s savings and loan scandals, the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act, to punish alleged misconduct causing the financial crisis.That law has a 10-year statute of limitations, double the usual length in securities fraud cases, which the government took advantage of when it sued Bank of America last August over alleged misconduct dating from early 2008. Bank of America was accused of misleading Wachovia Corp, now owned by Wells Fargo & Co, and the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco about risks in the $855 million offering, from which they bought about 98 percent of the securities.While the securities were backed by 1,191 seemingly safe ""jumbo"" adjustable-rate mortgages, the government said more than 40 percent of these home loans did not comply with Bank of America's underwriting standards.STRETCHING FIRREA The government claimed civil penalties under FIRREA based on the bank's alleged violations of laws to fight fraud in ""loan and credit applications"" and prohibit various false statements. Cayer, however, said the first law has been applied ""consistently"" to ""traditional customer related bank activities such as loans,"" and thus did not cover securities purchases.He also said the government failed to show as required that any false statements were ""material"" to the Federal Housing Finance Board, which regulated the FHLB-San Francisco, or that either of those entities ever complained.Bank of America spokesman Lawrence Grayson said the Charlotte-based bank is pleased with the recommendation.The bank had accused the Justice Department of stretching FIRREA beyond recognition to create ""an unprecedented, new regime for regulating securities - in addition to and inevitably inconsistent with the federal securities laws.""

81,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, March 27 (Fitch) The settlement between Bank of America Corporation  (BAC) and the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) resolves one of BAC's  largest remaining litigation exposures and is a positive step toward reducing  these risks, according to Fitch Ratings. There is no impact to BAC's ratings  (A/F1, Outlook Negative), as positive ratings momentum is more heavily  predicated on improved earnings and capital ratios.   Under terms of the agreement, BAC will make cash payments to Fannie Mae (FNM)  and Freddie Mac (FRE) of $6.3 billion and will purchase certain residential  mortgage backed securities (RMBS), currently valued at approximately $3.2  billion, from FNM and FRE. The cash payments are in line with our FHFA  litigation cash loss estimate of between $5 billion and $8 billion. However, our  estimates did not contemplate additional securities repurchases as a necessary  amount of consideration to complete the settlement. BAC estimates that these actions will reduce first-quarter 2014 pretax income by  approximately $3.7 billion, but that its Basel III Tier 1 common equity (CET1)  ratio under the standardized approach will hold steady at just over 9.0%. BAC's  relatively unchanged first-quarter 2014 pro forma post-settlement capital ratio  supports our view that FHFA litigation losses can be managed within the context  of current earnings forecasts and existing capital ratios. However, BAC's CET1  ratio still remains below some peers. This settlement resolves a significant portion of BAC's legacy litigation  exposure, so Fitch now expects the drag of litigation expenses and charges that  have weighed on the company's earnings to slowly abate over the course of a year  or two. That said, we believe it is still likely that BAC's core earnings  performance will be below those of some peers over the near-to-medium term time  horizon.   Future improvement in earnings will largely be predicated on management's  continued execution on efficiency initiatives, new business wins across the  franchise, and some help from higher long-term interest rates. Over time, this  should drive better earnings performance and thereby allow for the further  internal build of capital to enhance the company's capital ratios. If BAC's core earnings relative to both the cost of capital and the performance  of peers improve over the long term, and if the company further enhances its  capital position, there could be some positive momentum in BAC's ratings.

82,"   By Margaret Chadbourn and Aruna Viswanatha | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Bank of America agreed to pay $9.3 billion to settle claims that it sold Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac faulty mortgage bonds, helping the bank to end one of the largest legal headaches it still faced from the financial crisis.The settlement, announced on Wednesday, includes $6.3 billion in cash and the rest in securities that Bank of America will purchase from the two housing finance entities.The second-largest U.S. bank by assets said it had now resolved around 88 percent of its total exposure to securities at issue in the mortgage bond litigation it has faced.Bank of America's first-quarter profits could take a substantial hit from the deal. The bank said the settlement was expected to reduce first-quarter income by about 21 cents a share, or three-quarters of what analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S forecasted the bank to earn before the settlement was announced.Also on Wednesday, Bank of America and its former chief executive, Kenneth Lewis, settled a lawsuit by New York's attorney general that alleged it misled investors about mounting losses at Merrill Lynch & Co, which the bank agreed to acquire at the height of the financial crisis.Lewis, who resigned in 2009, agreed to pay $10 million and be barred for three years from serving as an officer or director of a public company. Bank of America agreed to pay $15 million and adopt corporate reforms. Both payments will cover the costs of New York's investigation, and neither Lewis nor Bank of America is admitting wrongdoing or paying damages. Bank of America still faces a lawsuit from the U.S. Justice Department and several other probes by the DOJ and states over mortgage-backed securities it sold during the housing boom. On Wednesday, the bank said it has had ""preliminary discussions"" to resolve the matters.'REASONABLE AND PRUDENT' The new settlement with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac resolves lawsuits filed against Bank of America, Merrill Lynch, and Countrywide, the subprime mortgage lender it bought at the height of the financial crisis. The regulator of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, had accused the bank of misrepresenting the quality of loans underlying residential mortgage-backed securities purchased by the two mortgage finance companies between 2005 and 2007.The two taxpayer-owned firms have operated under conservatorship since 2008, when they were seized by regulators after losses on subprime loans pushed them toward insolvency.It was the 10th settlement that the FHFA has reached in litigation that began in 2011 when it filed 18 lawsuits over about $200 billion in mortgage-backed securities, an investment product at the center of the recent global financial crisis.

87,"  (Adds details from decision, case citation, byline)By Jonathan StempelMarch 31 A federal judge on Monday recommended letting the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission pursue a lawsuit against Bank of America Corp over $855 million of mortgage securities that soured during the global financial crisis.U.S. Magistrate Judge David Cayer in Charlotte, North Carolina, where the bank is based, made the recommendation four days after urging dismissal of a related Department of Justice civil lawsuit, which alleged violations of a different law.That ruling had been seen as a possible setback for government efforts to fight fraud by Wall Street in the sale of mortgage securities.""We are reviewing the magistrate judge's recommendation carefully,"" bank spokesman Lawrence Grayson said on Monday, with regard to the SEC civil case. Both recommendations are subject to review by U.S. District Judge Max Cogburn in Charlotte. District judges are not bound by magistrate judges' recommendations but often follow them.Authorities accused Bank of America of misleading Wachovia Corp, now part of Wells Fargo & Co, and the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco about risks in the $855 million offering, dating from early 2008 and backed by 1,191 ""jumbo"" adjustable rate mortgages that proved less safe than expected.These loans had been made between July and November 2007, and had initial principal balances over $417,000, authorities said. The Justice Department had sued under the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989, which it has relied on in several recent financial crisis cases. Cayer said it failed to meet a requirement that any alleged false statements were ""material"" to a government regulator.But the SEC sued under the Securities Act of 1933, a law traditionally used to fight fraud in securities sales. Cayer said that regulator could pursue claims that Bank of America ""negligently made material misrepresentations and omissions.""About 70 percent of the loans went through the ""wholesale channel,"" or third-party brokers, even though then-Bank of America Chief Executive Kenneth Lewis had in a July 2007 conference call referred to such loans as ""toxic waste."" But Cayer said Bank of America hid the risks by ""directing"" investors in disclosures to supposedly comparable offerings where just 42 percent of loans went in the wholesale channel.""These allegations are sufficient to withstand dismissal,"" Cayer wrote.SEC spokesman John Nester declined to comment.Since 2010, Bank of America has agreed to pay well over $50 billion to settle legal and other claims stemming from the nation's housing and financial crises.The case is SEC v.

96,"  LONDON, April 7 (IFR) - JP Morgan and Bank of America Merrill Lynch are to join Morgan Stanley  on the syndicate for Emaar Properties' upcoming IPO of its retail and malls business, bankers said.Last month, Dubai's biggest property firm hired Morgan Stanley to manage an 8-9 billion dirham (US$2.18-2.45 billion) listing of its shopping mall and retail unit, a deal that promises to be the largest ECM transaction in the region since 2008.Emaar has now appointed JP Morgan to the topline along with Morgan Stanley, while Bank of America Merrill Lynch will be one step below as joint bookrunner. The listing, which was first contemplated before Dubai's real estate and stock market collapsed in 2009, underscores the extent of the emirate's recovery over the past few years. Residential property prices increased by more than 20 percent last year and Dubai's main equity index - the best performing bourse in the world in 2013 - is up 18.8 percent so far this year.

97,"   By Jonathan Stempel | April 8  April 8 The United States said its $5 billion civil fraud lawsuit against Standard & Poor's should be tried all at once, rejecting the credit rating agency's insistence that a single trial would be too big, confusing and unfair.S&P, a unit of McGraw Hill Financial Inc, was accused of causing losses for federally-insured banks and credit unions by inflating ratings to win more fees from issuers, and being too slow to downgrade debt backed by souring mortgages, contributing to the 2008 financial crisis.Last month, S&P proposed holding two trials, with the first focused on just 17 securities out of the roughly 160 at issue, where Citigroup Inc was alleged to have suffered losses.In a Monday court filing, U.S. Attorney Andre Birotte in Los Angeles said ""mini-trials"" would ""severely prejudice"" the United States by preventing it from showing ""the full and complete nature of S&P's alleged fraud"" to a single jury.He said this would include ""great swaths"" of evidence that S&P intended to defraud investors that, unlike Citigroup and Bank of America Corp, were not involved in the issuance of securities it rated.Holding one trial ""is particularly necessary to counter S&P's efforts to focus on isolated employee actions at an individual security level,"" Birotte wrote. He also said two trials would likely violate the 7th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, by allowing different juries to review many of the same overlapping issues in a single case.S&P has argued that a single trial would force it to present ""overwhelming"" amounts of evidence to counter the government's claims, perhaps more easily grasped by jurors, that its ratings lacked ""independence"" and ""objectivity.""Catherine Mathis, an S&P spokeswoman, said on Tuesday: ""The government has alleged a case of such sweeping breadth that it cannot fairly be tried in a single trial. Bifurcation is efficient, practical and fair."" U.S. DOWNGRADE The lawsuit is one of several where the government has used the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act, which was passed after the 1980s savings and loan scandal, to address alleged misconduct causing the financial crisis. U.S. District Judge David Carter in Santa Ana, California is expected to decide by April 15 whether to bifurcate the case. A trial is now scheduled for September 2015.According to the government, the lawsuit addresses alleged wrongdoing from 2004 to 2007, and covers 162 securities: 106 collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) and 56 residential mortgage-backed securities. S&P put the combined number at 158.The government said that if there were two trials, it would prefer the first to focus on all the CDOs, or a subset of CDOs that allegedly caused more than $4.5 billion of losses.S&P has contended that the government sued in retaliation for its 2011 decision to take away the United States' ""triple-A"" rating over Washington's inability to manage the country's debt.U.S. officials have denied such a link. The government did not sue S&P rivals Moody's Investors Service and Fitch Ratings.The case is U.S. v. McGraw-Hill Cos et al, U.S. District Court, Central District of California, No. 13-00779.

BA Continuum maintains another location in India that will remain open. The Bank of America spokesman said the company wanted to give the affected employees as much advance notice of the layoffs as possible to enable them to look for new jobs.Some of the duties performed by these workers will eventually be moved to other locations, the spokesman said. The closures should not have any impact on Bank of America's capital markets businesses in Latin America, the spokesman added. Wednesday's job cuts are the latest in a series at the Charlotte, North Carolina-based company.

101,"   By Peter Rudegeair  Bank of America Corp's (BAC.N) financial crisis hangover is lasting longer than expected, leading some investors to wonder if the massive litigation expenses being incurred have become a recurring cost of doing business instead of being dismissed as one-time items.The bank on Wednesday posted $6 billion of litigation costs for its first quarter, far exceeding the $3.7 billion of settlement costs that investors had previously known about.Since the 2008-2009 financial crisis, Bank of America has announced some $50 billion of settlements, before taxes. Without those charges, its income before taxes would have been about three times higher.It has posted more than $1 billion of expenses from announced and expected settlements, excluding its lawyer fees, in eight of the last seventeen quarters, and in some quarters many times that number. Litigation expenses in four of the five quarters since the start of 2013 have exceeded $1 billion.""It's almost like these guys have become the tobacco industry,"" said Matt McCormick, a portfolio manager at Bahl & Gaynor Investment Counsel, in reference to payments by cigarette makers to settle lawsuits. ""It becomes a constant irritant, these things just don't seem to go away,"" McCormick added. Bahl & Gaynor, which manages more than $11 billion, does not invest in Bank of America shares.Bank of America declined to estimate on Wednesday how much additional settlement costs may total beyond what it has already set aside.The expenses stem mainly from mortgages that Countrywide Financial Corp made during the housing boom and sold to investors. Bank of America bought Countrywide in July 2008, just as the mortgage collapse was triggering the crisis.Bank of America has resolved most of the outstanding litigation with investors, including most of their demands that the bank buy back bad mortgage bonds. The bank is now focusing on settlements with the U.S. Department of Justice and other enforcement agencies. On a conference call on Wednesday, analysts pressed Bank of America's Chief Financial Officer Bruce Thompson to indicate when the bank will stop piling up big litigation costs.Thompson said the bank has worked through many of its outstanding issues, but he added, ""I think we need to be realistic ... it is very hard to predict.""His response was more subdued than in October 2013, when he said on a conference call with investors: ""I think at this point relative to our peers we have tried to be out front and get through some of the larger settlements that we have.""The pain may continue longer than investors had hoped, but Bank of America's legal expenses will at some point start to subside as it works through the crisis-era matters still in litigation. ""Eventually it's going to be over. It's almost like a bad loan you're writing off"" that will bottom out some day, said David Ellison, a portfolio manager at Hennessy Funds, which holds Bank of America shares.GETTING IMPATIENT Legal expenses have been an issue for all Wall Street banks since the financial crisis, but Bank of America has been hit particularly hard.In December 2013, research firm SNL Financial tallied total credit crisis and mortgage-linked settlements for the biggest U.S. commercial and investment banks. Bank of America had generated more than half of the total. JPMorgan Chase & Co, (JPM.N) the next biggest on the list, was responsible for about 30 percent. Higher legal bills have undermined the cost-cutting initiatives introduced by Chief Executive Brian Moynihan. Through the bank's Project New BAC program, it achieved $1.5 billion of quarterly cost savings by the end of 2013. But litigation expenses that year averaged $1.5 billion per quarter.There had been signs the bank had been making progress in putting many of its legal troubles to bed at the start of 2014. In January, the bank received a New York judge's approval for a $8.5 billion settlement with investors over soured mortgage securities. The bank's $9.3 billion settlement with the Federal Housing Finance Agency in March resolved 88 percent of its total exposure to the mortgage bonds over which it had faced litigation.Still, some money managers are getting impatient.""When does it end?

104,"  NEW YORK Bank of America's wealth management businesses slowed in the first quarter, with profit at its Merrill Lynch brokerage and U.S. Trust private banking units slipping 6.5 percent to $729 million from $777 million in the last quarter of 2013.The return on the $12 billion of capital allocated to the wealth businesses fell to 24.7 percent from 29.4 percent in the 2013 first quarter and 31 percent from the fourth quarter.The returns, however, are still far higher than those in Bank of America's riskier trading and investment banking businesses, which have been hemmed in by new regulations designed to prevent another financial crisis. That explains why big banks continue to invest in businesses aimed at rich families and individuals.The results Bank of America reported on Wednesday track an industrywide trend in which banks are countering client caution about markets by nudging them from commission-based trading accounts to fee-based accounts tied to growth of their assets. They also are urging them to buy loans and other bank products.Merrill Lynch said that for at least the second straight quarter, revenue from wealthy and ""ultra-high-net-worth"" clients in its core wealth management businesses was split almost equally among fees, trading commissions and interest income from loans and deposits. Measured by another metric, 45 percent of Merrill's almost 14,000 brokers have more than half of their clients in at least one fee-based relationship.The trend is part of a cultural shift in which big brokerage firms are encouraging brokers to talk less about individual stocks, bonds and funds and more about helping clients meet long-term goals such as saving for children's college, healthcare and retirement. This allows banks to book more stable income that is less subject to the whims of investor trading appetites. Wells Fargo & Co, whose U.S. brokerage unit has the second largest number of financial advisers, last week reported a 41 percent jump in first-quarter profit in its wealth business on a big jump in fees. But the $475 million of profits trailed those at Bank of America's wealth business.The banks also are encouraging brokers to sell loans and other bank products and to work in teams, in hopes of locking clients into relationships that will outlast the retirement of brokers whose average age is in the mid- to late-50s.Wells said its wealth management clients average more than 10 product relations with the bank. Merrill said referrals within Bank of America to and from wealth management have grown by 30 percent since a year ago. While profitability at Merrill and U.S. Trust slowed, revenue rose 3 percent from a year ago and 2.9 percent from the fourth quarter to a record $4.5 billion, pumped by $2 billion of asset management fees.

107,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, April 16 (Fitch) Bank of America Corporation's (BAC) stated first  quarter 2014 (1Q'14) earnings swung to a net loss applicable to common  shareholders of $514 million due to significant litigation charges incurred in  the quarter, according to Fitch Ratings.  This loss was surprising and reversed  the trend of improving stated earnings over the last several quarters, Fitch  would note the last couple of which had also been significantly aided by reserve  releases. Specifically, BAC incurred a $3.6 billion incremental charge to 1Q'14 earnings  in conjunction with its previously announced settlement with The Federal Finance  and Housing Administration (FHFA).  Separately, BAC also incurred an additional  $2.4 billion charge related to boosting litigation reserves due to legacy  mortgage-related litigation, which was outside of Fitch's expectations for this  quarter's earnings.   Fitch calculated pre-tax profits, which excluded CVA/DVA adjustments, securities  gains, and some litigation charges amounted to $4.9 billion in 1Q'14, which  equated to a 0.91% pre-tax adjusted return on assets, which is an improvement  relative to the sequential and year-ago quarters.  However, if Fitch includes  the $2.4 billion charge noted above, which it had not contemplated, BAC's  adjusted Fitch calculated pre-tax income would have been $2.5 billion, which  equates to a 0.46% adjusted return on assets.  This is down from the sequential  quarter and somewhat inline with the adjusted return on assets of the year-ago  quarter, which included charges related to a settlement with MBIA. Based on either calculation, Fitch would note that BAC's core earnings  performance continues to be below that of peer institutions during 1Q'14, and  Fitch believes that this relatively weaker core earnings performance constrains  upwards rating momentum.  Fitch would expect incremental litigation costs to  continue to weigh on BAC's earnings over a near-to-intermediate term time  horizon.  Over a longer period of time as BAC eventually incurs fewer litigation  costs and continues to execute on its efficiency initiatives, Fitch believes  that it is possible for the company's earnings to improve to peer levels and  come closer to Fitch's long-term cost of equity assumption for BAC. Notwithstanding the litigation issues noted above, 1Q'14 core earnings were  mixed.  BAC's stated net interest income (NII) was down from both the sequential  and year-ago quarter.  In the year-ago quarter, lower overall asset yields more  than offset reductions in funding costs.  Non-interest income was more mixed as  continued strength in BAC's wealth and investment management unit was offset by   weaker year-over year performance in Fixed Income Currency & Commodities (FICC)  results, relatively flat equities trading results, and the continued and  expected decline in mortgage banking results.   While expenses were impacted by the charges noted above, BAC did reasonably well  in managing its core expense base during the quarter.   However, BAC's overall provision expense for credit losses did increase to $1  billion during the quarter, as more moderate reserve releases related to  mortgage and home equity loans were in part offset by some reserve build  relative to the sequential quarter related to  the company's higher commercial  loan balances.   Fitch continues to note that BAC's liquidity profile with more than $1.13  trillion in deposits continues to be a relative strength of the company.   Additionally, Fitch expects that BAC may further reduce its long-term debt  footprint over the balance of the year.   BAC's earnings and capital position continue to absorb the company's litigation  losses noted above, and held relatively steady during the quarter.  Due largely  to some modest reductions in the loan portfolio, BAC's Basel III Tier 1 Common  (CET1) ratio under the standardized approach was 9.3% in 1Q'14, modestly up from  the 9.1% ratio at year-end (YE) 2013.  Under the advanced approach BAC's Basel  III CET1 ratio was 9.9%, down modestly from 10% at YE2013, due in large part to  higher operational risk charges in the calculation of risk weighted assets (RWA)  under the advanced approach.  Fitch continues to expect that over a medium term  time horizon, BAC's binding capital ratio will be the standardized ratio under  Basel III. Fitch continues to note that while BAC's capital position has been able to  absorb the company's legal charges, the company's capital ratios remain below  those of global peers.  Fitch would expect that should legal charges eventually  abate, BAC's capital position could improve to at least peer levels over time,  which Fitch would view positively from a credit perspective.

108,"   By Peter Rudegeair and Tanya Agrawal  Bank of America Corp reported an unexpected first-quarter loss on Wednesday after it took a $6 billion charge to cover litigation expenses, a figure that far exceeded the legal settlements the No. 2 U.S. bank has announced recently.Revenue improved in many of the bank's major businesses, but the results were overshadowed by its bigger-than-expected legal costs. The bank had previously said that a settlement would cut into its earnings by $3.7 billion before taxes.The extra litigation expenses came from setting aside money to cover future legal settlements tied to previously disclosed mortgage-related matters, Chief Financial Officer Bruce Thompson told reporters.Still, the bank's setting aside more money does not mean a settlement is imminent, Thompson told analysts on a separate conference call.The bank's shares fell 2.1 percent to $16.04 on the New York Stock Exchange shortly after midday.Rivals JPMorgan Chase & Co and Citigroup Inc had made profits for the quarter.Bank of America's quarterly loss, its first since the second quarter of 2011, underscores how much the bank is still suffering from its disastrous acquisition in 2008 of Countrywide Financial Corp at the height of the financial crisis. That deal was a key factor in the more than $50 billion of legal expenses the bank has logged since the financial crisis.In March, Bank of America agreed to a $9.3 billion settlement to resolve claims that Countrywide and other Bank of America entities overstated the quality of the mortgages they sold to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac between 2005 and 2007. [ID:nL1N0MN1XF] The bank had previously set aside funds to cover much of the settlement with the two agencies, but not all of it.Indeed, the bank still has other home loan issues to resolve. In March, Bank of America said it was still subject to penalties and fines from the U.S. Department of Justice, state attorneys general, and other government authorities for mortgages and related bonds.There was positive news for the bank in the results.Income rose in its wealth management, trading, and retail banking businesses, and it wrote off fewer bad loans. It cut staff levels.""Higher litigation costs clearly blurred the progress we made,"" said Thompson. The bank reported a net loss for shareholders of $514 million, or 5 cents per share, for the quarter ended March 31. That comes after it earned a profit of $1.11 billion, or 10 cents a share, a year earlier.Analysts, on average, had expected earnings of 5 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.LAGGING RIVALS In 2013's first quarter, results were hit by $1.6 billion in charges related to disputes with bond insurers.Revenue fell 3.8 percent to $22.66 billion, excluding accounting adjustments, but beat the average analyst estimate of $22.33 billion.Bank of America's performance lagged rivals. Both Citigroup Inc and Wells Fargo & Co reported better-than-expected profit, while JPMorgan Chase & Co missed estimates as bond-trading revenue fell. Bank of America's 2011 quarterly loss came after it took more than $20 billion of mortgage-linked charges. Taking into account the expense of paying dividends to preferred shareholders, the bank posted a net loss to common shareholders in the third quarter of 2012.Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Morgan Stanley will report first-quarter results on Thursday.The loss follows Bank of America's best year since before the financial crisis.The bank's 2013 net income of $11.4 billion was the highest since 2007, but large legal bills and settlements left over from the financial crisis remain a drag on performance.BofA made progress resolving many of its legal issues in the first quarter, although some proved to be costly.In addition to the settlement with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the bank received a New York judge's approval for its $8.5 billion settlement with investors in mortgage securities that went sour. Litigation expenses of $6 billion compared with $2.2 billion in the first quarter of 2013. Non-interest expenses increased to $22.24 billion from $19.50 billion.Costs in the bank's Legacy Assets and Servicing division, excluding litigation expenses, fell to $1.6 billion from $2.6 billion a year earlier and $1.8 billion in the third quarter.The Charlotte-based bank has said that costs in the unit, which handles delinquent mortgage loans, would fall below $1.1 billion a quarter by the end of 2014 and will be about $500 million a quarter by the end of 2015.BAD LOAN ALLOWANCES Bank of America released $379 million from its allowances for bad loans, compared with $804 million in the same period a year earlier and $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter.BofA's net charge-off ratio fell to 0.62 percent in the quarter from 1.14 percent in the same period a year earlier.Revenue from fixed-income trading declined 1.7 percent to $2.95 billion as many clients took to the sidelines in the quarter, awaiting clarity from the Federal Reserve on its interest rate intentions.Results in the year-ago quarter were hurt by a settlement with a bond insurance company. Adjusting for that settlement, bond trading revenue fell 15 percent in the first quarter of 2014, the company said.Still, the bank performed better than Citigroup, whose revenue from the business fell 18 percent. JPMorgan Chase's bond trading revenue dropped 21 percent, including an accounting adjustment that Bank of America and Citigroup strip out.Bank of America's net interest margin, excluding market-related adjustments, was 2.36 percent, compared with 2.30 percent in the first quarter of 2013.During the quarter, the bank received the Federal Reserve's blessing to increase its quarterly dividend to 5 cents per share from 1 cent and repurchase $4 billion in common shares.(Reporting by Peter Rudegeair in New York and Tanya Agrawal in Bangalore; Editing by Ted Kerr, Dan Wilchins, Bernadette Baum and Richard Chang)",2014-04-16,BAC,"Wed Apr 16, 2014 | 12:35pm EDT",BofA reports first quarterly loss since 2011 on lofty legal bill,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-bankofamerica-results-idUSBREA3F0O520140416?type=companyNews

120,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, April 28 (Fitch) Bank of America Corporation (BAC) announced today that  it uncovered an error in the estimate of its regulatory capital calculations,  and as a result regulators are requiring it to suspend its planned capital  distributions. Fitch Ratings does not expect that BAC's ratings, currently at  'A/F1' with a Negative Rating Outlook, will be impacted by this issue. Details of the error related to an incorrect treatment of a maturing structured  note liability related to the 2009 acquisition of Merrill Lynch that led to a  nearly 30 basis point overstatement of the company's Basel III fully phased-in  Tier 1 common (CET1) ratio under both the standardized and advanced approach.  BAC's revised Basel III CET1 ratio under the standardized approach was 9.0%, and  under the advanced approach was 9.6% as of March 31, 2014.  Fitch notes that BAC's capital ratios prior to the restatement were below the  average CET1 ratio of some peers, and this revision very modestly increases the  gap. The Federal Reserve has required BAC to resubmit its capital plan and suspend  any planned capital distributions including those that were approved during the  2014 CCAR exercise completed last month. Fitch believes that the suspension of  capital distributions should allow BAC to rebuild its capital ratios to its  previously stated levels over a reasonable time horizon; however, the company's  potential distributions over the balance of the year may be materially impacted. Fitch also believes that the company may run at larger capital buffers given  some of the procedural difficulties highlighted by this issue.

121,"   By Joan Magee and Guillermo Parra-Bernal | SAO PAULO, April 28  SAO PAULO, April 28 Grupo Oi SA, Brazil's biggest fixed-line telephone carrier, on Monday got closer to its planned merger with Portugal Telecom SGPS SA as investors were willing to place more than enough bids in a share offering expected to be worth at least 8 billion reais ($3.6 billion), sources told Reuters.The offering consists of a combined 5.75 billion common and preferred shares and could rise by almost 2 billion shares with supplementary and additional allotments. According to two sources with direct knowledge of the deal, Oi's preferred shares  may price at around 2 reais, or at the bottom of the suggested range of 2 reais to 2.30 reais.So far, investors have pledged to buy as much as 10 billion reais worth of stock in the offering, said the sources, who requested anonymity because the deal is in the works. The share offering is scheduled to price later on Monday, according to a prospectus released on April 3.Preferred shares fell to a record low in Monday afternoon trading, shedding 5.6 percent to 2.37 reais, while common shares were down 2.4 percent to 2.47 reais. Banks estimate that Oi needs to raise at least 8 billion reais in order to adequately reduce Oi's stifling debt. Rio de Janeiro-based Oi, which also controls Brazil's fourth-largest mobile phone carrier, expects to use fresh capital to beef up CorpCo, the proposed name of the company after the proposed tie-up with Portugal Telecom.Executives at Oi and Portugal Telecom say CorpCo will have more clout to compete in Brazil with bigger rivals such as the local unit of Spain's Telefonica SA , Telecom Italia SpA's TIM Participações SA  and Mexico's America Movil SAB. Under terms of the deal, Portugal Telecom will contribute its assets, excluding its stake in Oi, and own 38 percent of the new company. Oi would have as much as 30 percent of CorpCo and other investors such as BTG Pactual and a number of Brazilian pension funds would own the rest.Each Oi common share would be exchanged for 1 share in  CorpCo and each Oi preferred share would be swapped for 0.9211 CorpCo share. Grupo BTG Pactual SA, the largest listed Latin American investment bank, is handling the transaction, along with the investment-banking units of Bank of America Corp , Barclays Plc, Citigroup Inc, Credit Suisse Group AG, Banco Espírito Santo SA and HSBC Holdings Plc.Banco do Brasil SA.

But there are early signs of banks loosening the terms at which they lend, by demanding less interest, and in some cases making longer-term loans and bigger loans than they would last year or the year before.In 2013, Chad Jensen, the chief financial officer at The Cellular Connection, a U.S. Verizon Wireless retailer with about $700 million in annual revenue from almost 900 stores in 28 states, was looking for a loan and a line of credit to finance potential acquisitions and capital expenditures.He met with big banks including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America Corp and Wells Fargo & Co, but chose PNC late last year because it offered a 30 percent lower rate and understood his business better, he said. Though the Marion, Indiana-based company closed the deal with PNC late last year, bankers are still banging on his door, Jensen said.""I've gotten a significant influx of calls from all the regional players,"" Jensen said.The competition to land new business loans reflects the pressure that banks are under to boost profits in a low interest-rate environment that weighs on their returns.Business loans are attractive to lenders because they are performing so well. Loss rates on commercial and industrial loans have fallen to 0.30 percent across the banking system, near their lowest level since the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation started keeping public data on the issue in 1984 and down from a post-crisis high of 2.72 percent in the fourth quarter of 2009.Executives at the biggest banks think pricing and other terms are getting too generous on at least some of these loans.""We are seeing the ongoing aggressive competitive environment on both credit terms and pricing, and we'll do every rational and sensible deal we can do, but we're not going to chase growth at the expense of discipline,"" JPMorgan Chase finance chief Marianne Lake said on an April 11 conference call, when asked about commercial loan growth. Regional banks, meanwhile, say they are expanding their corporate loan books faster.""We will continue to compete on price and we may be one of those culprits for why it is more competitive on the margin,"" US Bancorp chief executive Richard Davis said on an April 16 conference call with analysts, adding that the bank is able to do so because its funding costs are lower than rivals.Those trends were clear in first quarter results. Wells Fargo and Bank of America increased their total commercial portfolios by 1.1 percent and 0.1 percent, respectively, while JPMorgan Chase saw its total commercial and corporate loans decline 0.4 percent.In contrast, regional banks like US Bancorp, PNC, and KeyCorp increased the size of their total commercial loan portfolios by more than 3 percent compared with the fourth quarter of 2013.Representatives for US Bancorp, PNC and KeyCorp declined to comment. Federal Reserve data show that total commercial and industrial loans outstanding reached a record $1.69 trillion for the week ended April 16, on a seasonally adjusted basis. The annualized growth rate spiked to 12.4 percent in the first quarter from 7.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2013, well above the roughly 9 percent average since the financial crisis.These growth rates are alarming to regulators. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which regulates many banks with branches in multiple states, warned in a December report that low delinquency levels over a prolonged period may spur banks to take too much risk. The OCC and the Fed also clamping down on the riskiest loans banks make to companies, namely junk-rated loans. [ID: nL2N0NH1SB]""It's really near and dear to us to make sure there's sound underwriting and that you don't inappropriately weaken your standards, especially when you're in an increasingly hot market,"" said Thomas Curry, the Comptroller of the Currency, referring to commercial lending.""Discipline is important, and that's what we try to emphasize with our banks,"" Curry added, speaking at the Reuters Financial Regulation Summit on Tuesday.The Fed's quarterly survey of loan officers in January at banks found that 10 of the 73 banks that responded had ""eased somewhat"" their lending standards for large and mid-sized companies. In January 2012, all banks that responded said they were keeping standards for these borrowers unchanged. FEWER LEVERS In general, regional banks have fewer ways to pursue growth compared with the biggest banks, which can rely on a wide range of other businesses like stock and bond underwriting and wealth management.Net interest income from Bank of America's global banking and markets units, which contains the majority of its commercial loans, amounted to 13 percent of the company's total in the first quarter. In contrast, net interest income from PNC's corporate and institutional banking segment amounted to 25 percent of the company's overall revenue in the first quarter.""Banks have a choice: you can sit on the sidelines and choose not to compete on price, but that will be at the expense of loan growth,"" said Jennifer Thompson, a bank analyst at Portales Partners in New York. ""Or you can compete on price. Your margins will suffer, but you get the loan"" and possibly deepen the relationship with a given client by selling more services, Thompson added.The banks ramping making more commercial loans acknowledge that profitability is declining.The average yield in the commercial loan portfolio of KeyCorp, a regional bank headquartered in Cleveland with about $93 billion of assets, fell 3.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2013.KeyCorp chief executive Beth Mooney said on an April 17 conference call that ""we continue to see loan yields reflecting the competitive pricing environment.""Bank of America, which says it is being more disciplined than its competitors, said the average yield on its total commercial portfolio rose 1.1 percent over the same period.Pinpointing the specific bank loan portfolios that will experience the greatest loss is difficult to determine until the economy starts to deteriorate, analysts said.""Every single bank will tell you that they're not giving up on credit standards, and we won't see whether that's true or not until the next crisis hits,"" Portales' Thompson said.

130,"  May 21 Bank of America Corp is dismantling an electronic market-making unit it set up last year to serve its Merrill Lynch wealth-management unit's clients, two people with knowledge of the matter told Bloomberg.Increased regulatory scrutiny of U.S. equity markets and managers' concerns for the potential perception of a conflict of interest killed the project, the media service reported, citing people familiar with the situation who requested anonymity.

131,"  (Adds comment from Ocwen in 12th paragraph.)By Michelle ConlinMay 21 Joseph and Neidin Henard thought they had finally fixed the mortgage that was crushing them.In January, the couple reached a settlement with every company that had a stake in the mortgage on their house in Santa Cruz, California, a deal that would have slashed their monthly payment by almost 40 percent to $3,337. It appeared to be the end of a process that started with their defaulting in 2009.But when they saw the final paperwork for their settlement, they found that Ocwen Financial Corp, the company that collected and processed their mortgage payments, had added an extra clause: they could not say or print or post anything negative about Ocwen, ever.The Henards' experience was not unusual. Mortgage payment collectors at companies including Ocwen, Bank of America Corp  and PNC Financial Services Group are agreeing to ease the terms of borrowers' underwater mortgages, but they are increasingly demanding that homeowners promise not to insult them publicly, consumer lawyers say. In many cases, they are demanding that homeowners' lawyers agree to the same terms. Sometimes, they even require borrowers to agree not to sue them again.These clauses can hurt borrowers who later have problems with their mortgage collector by preventing them from complaining publicly about their difficulties or suing, lawyers said. If a collector, known as a servicer, makes an error, getting everything fixed can be a nightmare without litigation or public outcry.A 2013 report by the National Consumer Law Center found that servicers routinely lost borrowers' paperwork,  inaccurately input information, failed to send important letters to the correct address-or sometimes just didn't send them at all.""If your servicer screws up, you can't say anything about it,"" said homeowner attorney Danielle Kelley in Tallahassee, Florida. ""The homeowner has no defense.""Regulators are taking note. After Reuters' story was published on Wednesday, New York's Superintendent of Financial Services, Benjamin Lawsky, said he is investigating Ocwen's use of these clauses. A source familiar with Lawsky's thinking said that he could expand the probe to other servicers.Gag orders and bans on suing are appearing when borrowers use litigation to settle foreclosure and loan modification cases. But they are also popping up when servicers modify loan terms outside of the courts, known as ""ordinary loan modifications,"" according to consumer lawyers.Bank of America doesn't include non-disparagement clauses and releases of claims in the course of ordinary loan modifications - just in ones involving negotiated legal settlements, spokesman Rick Simon said. Waivers don't preclude customers from filing suits on post-settlement issues, he said.PNC's vice president of external communications, Marcey Zwiebel, said ""these clauses are part of the consideration we receive for agreeing to settle the case. This helps to ensure that the discussion is not re-opened in public after the case has been settled.""Ocwen said in a statement that it only uses non-disparagement clauses when there is a legal dispute with a borrower, adding that these cases represent less than one percent of the loans in its portfolio. The company also said that it believes the clauses are consistent with industry practice and that they help both sides achieve closure with the dispute. Attorneys for lenders and servicers say consumer lawyers are overstating the importance of these clauses. Banks are looking to avoid being sued again for the issues resolved in the settlement, but understand they may be sued if they are responsible for a future wrong, said Martin Bryce, a partner with Ballard Spahr in Philadelphia who specializes in consumer finance and banking.Bryce acknowledges that the language is ambiguous - under the waivers, homeowners often give up the right to sue on claims ""whether existing now or to come into existence in the future.""The non-disparagement clauses are meant to protect banks from public insults from borrowers, which the lender can often not respond to without violating privacy laws, Bryce said.Banks and servicers have been facing bad publicity along these lines for years, and while quantifying the impact of this bad-mouthing is difficult, few banks would choose to face it.On a Facebook page devoted to denigrating Bank of America, one homeowner said, ""They are without a doubt the worst organization I have ever dealt with.

They deserve it!!""JUST WANTING IT TO END Clauses preventing future disparagement and lawsuits first started appearing after the housing crash, but they have grown more widespread in the last six months, said Ira Rheingold, executive director of the National Association of Consumer Advocates in Washington. In January, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a U.S. government agency, said it examined two servicers who were requiring homeowners to give up their right to sue as part of ordinary loan modifications. The CFPB said the practice was ""unfair,"" and required the two servicers to cease the practice.The agency also directed the servicers to stop enforcing existing waiver clauses and ""to provide notice to the borrowers that it would not enforce these waivers in the future,"" according to a CFPB Supervisory Highlights bulletin. The agency didn't name the two servicers.On Wednesday, New York's Lawsky said he too was alarmed by servicers' using the clauses.""Reports that Ocwen is imposing a gag rule for certain struggling homeowners - preventing them from criticizing the company - are troubling and deeply offensive,"" said Lawsky in an emailed statement to Reuters. ""We will investigate this issue immediately.""Lawsky's office has had a monitor at Ocwen since 2011, as a condition of his approving the company's purchase of Litton Loan Servicing from Goldman Sachs Group Inc.These clauses are likely more popular because mortgage companies are trying to stem their expenses from the housing crisis, which triggered some 5.1 million foreclosures, consumer lawyers said. Having helped create the foreclosure epidemic, banks are now paying the price, spending billions of dollars on fines, penalties, mortgage settlements with borrowers, and other charges associated with working through the glut of bad loans.Since 2009, Bank of America alone has logged some $50 billion of expenses for settlements of lawsuits and related legal costs, many of them linked to mortgages. Without those charges, its income before taxes would have been about three times higher. Homeowner attorneys say they advise their clients not to sign non-disparagement agreements. But some of them do so just end the ordeal.""I try to talk my clients out of agreeing to it, but a lot of times they will agree,"" said Pamela Simmons, an attorney with the law office of Simmons & Purdy in Soquel, California.LOAN MODIFICATIONS During the past few years, loan servicers have been renegotiating mortgage terms with borrowers who have fallen behind on their payments. Since the housing crash, there have been about 1.3 million loan modifications done under the government's Home Affordable Modification Program, according to the U.S. Department of Treasury. Servicers have done an additional 5.6 million modifications in-house.Companies like Ocwen say that modifying mortgages is cheaper than foreclosing.  Servicers modify mortgages through some combination of changing monthly payments or interest rates, lengthening the terms of loans, and changing the principal owed, either by forgiving some of the loan or by adding on penalties and fees to make it bigger.The 2012 National Mortgage settlement, which covered Ally Financial Group, Bank of America, Citigroup Inc,  JPMorgan Chase & Co and Wells Fargo & Co  prohibited the use of waivers during the course of offering normal loan modifications-though it did allow for waivers in the event of litigation. Waivers were also forbidden under HAMP modifications.That still leaves plenty of room for servicers to try to block borrowers from suing, or to use gag clauses.Attorneys say the experience of the Henards was typical: the gag orders often pop up after borrowers think deal negotiations have been completed.The Henards balked when they saw the Ocwen clause stating that they were to ""not make any derogatory and/or disparaging comments about Ocwen or publish or discuss this Agreement or the settlement and compromise evidenced hereby on the internet or with the media.""""We are worried about them coming back against people in the future,"" said Dan Mulligan, the Henards' attorney. ""It's just a risk you don't want to take."" The Henards have about $680,000 outstanding on their mortgage.Ocwen responded in court documents that the language was ""standard boilerplate.""

134,"   By Michelle Conlin  May 21 Joseph and Neidin Henard thought they had finally fixed the mortgage that was crushing them.In January, the couple reached a settlement with every company that had a stake in the mortgage on their house in Santa Cruz, California, a deal that would have slashed their monthly payment by almost 40 percent to $3,337. It was the end of a process that started with their defaulting in 2009.But when they saw the final paperwork for their settlement, they found that Ocwen Financial Corp, the company that collected and processed their mortgage payments, had added an extra clause: they could not say or print or post anything negative about Ocwen, ever.The Henards' experience was not unusual. Mortgage payment collectors at companies including Ocwen, Bank of America Corp  and PNC Financial Services Group are agreeing to ease the terms of borrowers' underwater mortgages, but they are increasingly demanding that homeowners promise not to insult them publicly, consumer lawyers say. In many cases, they are demanding that homeowners' lawyers agree to the same terms. Sometimes, they even require borrowers to agree not to sue them again.These clauses can hurt borrowers who later have problems with their mortgage collector by preventing them from complaining publicly about their difficulties or suing, lawyers said. If a collector, known as a servicer, makes an error, getting everything fixed can be a nightmare without litigation or public outcry.A 2013 report by the National Consumer Law Center found that servicers routinely lost borrowers' paperwork,  inaccurately input information, failed to send important letters to the correct address-or sometimes just didn't send them at all.""If your servicer screws up, you can't say anything about it,"" said homeowner attorney Danielle Kelley in Tallahassee, Florida. ""The homeowner has no defense.""Gag orders and bans on suing are appearing when borrowers use litigation to settle foreclosure and loan modification cases. But they are also popping up when servicers modify loan terms outside of the courts, known as ""ordinary loan modifications,"" according to consumer lawyers.Bank of America doesn't include non-disparagement clauses and releases of claims in the course of ordinary loan modifications - just in ones involving negotiated legal settlements, spokesman Rick Simon said. Waivers don't preclude customers from filing suits on post-settlement issues, he said.PNC's vice president of external communications, Marcey Zwiebel, said ""these clauses are part of the consideration we receive for agreeing to settle the case. This helps to ensure that the discussion is not re-opened in public after the case has been settled.""Ocwen declined to comment, citing pending litigation.Attorneys for lenders and servicers say consumer lawyers are overstating the importance of these clauses. Banks are looking to avoid being sued again for the issues resolved in the settlement, but understand they may be sued if they are responsible for a future wrong, said Martin Bryce, a partner with Ballard Spahr in Philadelphia who specializes in consumer finance and banking. Bryce acknowledges that the language is ambiguous - under the waivers, homeowners often give up the right to sue on claims ""whether existing now or to come into existence in the future.""The non-disparagement clauses are meant to protect banks from public insults from borrowers, which the lender can often not respond to without violating privacy laws, Bryce said.Banks and servicers have been facing bad publicity along these lines for years, and while quantifying the impact of this bad-mouthing is difficult, few banks would choose to face it.On a Facebook page devoted to denigrating Bank of America, one homeowner said, ""They are without a doubt the worst organization I have ever dealt with. Keep suing them America! They deserve it!!""JUST WANTING IT TO END Clauses preventing future disparagement and lawsuits first started appearing after the housing crash, but they have grown more widespread in the last six months, said Ira Rheingold, executive director of the National Association of Consumer Advocates in Washington. In January, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a U.S. government agency, said it examined two servicers who were requiring homeowners to give up their right to sue as part of ordinary loan modifications. The CFPB said the practice was ""unfair,"" and required the two servicers to cease the practice.The agency also directed the servicers to stop enforcing existing waiver clauses and ""to provide notice to the borrowers that it would not enforce these waivers in the future,"" according to a CFPB Supervisory Highlights bulletin. The agency didn't name the two servicers.These clauses are likely more popular because mortgage companies are trying to stem their expenses from the housing crisis, which triggered some 5.1 million foreclosures, consumer lawyers said. Having helped create the foreclosure epidemic, banks are now paying the price, spending billions of dollars on fines, penalties, mortgage settlements with borrowers, and other charges associated with working through the glut of bad loans.Since 2009, Bank of America alone has logged some $50 billion of expenses for settlements of lawsuits and related legal costs, many of them linked to mortgages. Without those charges, its income before taxes would have been about three times higher.Homeowner attorneys say they advise their clients not to sign non-disparagement agreements. But some of them do so just end the ordeal.""I try to talk my clients out of agreeing to it, but a lot of times they will agree,"" said Pamela Simmons, an attorney with the law office of Simmons & Purdy in Soquel, California. LOAN MODIFICATIONS During the past few years, loan servicers have been renegotiating mortgage terms with borrowers who have fallen behind on their payments. Since the housing crash, there have been about 1.3 million loan modifications done under the government's Home Affordable Modification Program, according to the U.S. Department of Treasury. Servicers have done an additional 5.6 million modifications in-house.Companies like Ocwen say that modifying mortgages is cheaper than foreclosing.

144,"   By John Peragine | ASHEVILLE N.C.  ASHEVILLE N.C. A federal judge on Wednesday said he would consider dismissing a U.S. Department of Justice lawsuit accusing Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) of civil fraud in the sale of mortgage securities that soured during the global financial crisis.While not issuing a formal ruling, U.S. District Judge Max Cogburn said he had concerns and indicated at a hearing in Asheville, North Carolina that he might adopt the recommendation of a federal magistrate judge for a dismissal of the fraud claims tied to the $850 million (506.29 million pounds)sale of securities.""DOJ may not have the evidence to try this as a fraud case,"" Cogburn said.Cogburn's skepticism comes at a crucial time, as the second-largest U.S. bank negotiates with the Justice Department and other federal and state authorities to potentially pay more than $12 billion to resolve a range of probes into its sale of mortgage securities that quickly imploded.Cogburn also told assistant U.S. Attorney Daniel Ryan that the government needed to provide more substantial information to support its case.While the case from the U.S. Attorney's office in Charlotte is not a major factor in Bank of America's negotiations, it has added further pressure on the bank as it seeks to put a range of mortgage-related liabilities stemming from the financial crisis behind it.  In announcing the lawsuit, Attorney General Eric Holder had said it reflected the Justice Department's ongoing efforts to ""hold accountable those who engage in fraudulent or irresponsible conduct.”TWO CASES  In March, U.S. Magistrate Judge David Cayer recommended dismissal of the lawsuit, saying that the case did not fit the statutes the government relied on in bringing it. Civil prosecutors in Charlotte had charged Bank of America under a civil fraud law, FIRREA, which requires it to reference criminal statutes that it believes are implicated.The lawsuit references two criminal laws, including one that bars false statements to government agencies and is often used to prosecute people accused of covering up a crime.  It also referred to another law which Cayer said only applied to traditional customer-related bank activities such as loans, and not securities.On Wednesday, Cogburn said he would consider allowing the Justice Department to amend its complaint. Cogburn also considered a related lawsuit the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission brought against Bank of America, which Cayer had recommended should proceed. At the hearing Cogburn said he had not yet made a final decision but was inclined to uphold Cayer's recommendation on the SEC lawsuit.

146,"   By Joy Wiltermuth  NEW YORK, June 11 (IFR) - Banks are mulling ways to securitize US home equity lines of credit - popular loans that suffered in the financial crisis but are coming back into vogue as house prices rise.Lenders like the higher yields they can charge for the loans, known as HELOCs, but not the high capital provisions they require to satisfy Basel III rules.So one option is to take the loans off balance sheet and bundle them into an RMBS - a common tactic before the crisis that created a US$100bn-plus HELOC securitization market back in the 2007 heyday.While HELOCs dropped to cents on the dollar after the housing crash, loan volumes are now on the rise, driving hopes of a HELOC-backed RMBS comeback that could be spearheaded by lenders such as Wells Fargo, Bank of America, which acquired Countrywide, and JP Morgan Chase.""For now, it's a balance sheet product going to high-net-worth individuals,"" a residential lender in the sector told IFR.But the lender said would-be issuers are looking at how they can get to the securitization stage.Getting investors on board is a major hurdle, especially as HELOCs suffered a 12-month loss severity rate of 86.78% as of June, according to data firm Intex.Jonathan Kunkle, who heads LenderLive Network's document services arm, said originators are exploring securitization,      but believes this time around issuers will need to retain some risk to make a HELOC-backed RMBS palatable to the buy side.Kunkle is helping banks - and some non-depository lenders - dust off their home equity lending platforms to satisfy new consumer protection and regulatory rules.UNDERWATER HOMES Rating agencies have yet to receive inquiries from HELOC lenders about rating new HELOC-backed RMBS structures, but they will likely be cautious. Critics say HELOCs lure borrowers into drawing out cash against their properties at low initial rates, which can leave them in a vulnerable position if rates rise to unsustainable levels.Another problem is having enough loans to bundle together.Some homeowners have been keen to take out a second line of credit against their homes as values have risen, resulting in US98.8bn of new lines opening in 2013 - a 26% year-on-year increase, according to Equifax.But last year's origination volume was still only about a third of what it was in 2007.It's often cheaper for homeowners to refinance a mortgage at record low rates than to add an extra loan, one banker said.He said the sector is still largely focused on getting the first mortgage, prime jumbo RMBS market working. Still, some market participants are hopeful of more HELOC growth ahead, and demand from borrowers whose home valuations are still under water is seen as a driving force.There are 6.3m mortgaged US homes still stuck in negative equity territory as of the first quarter, according to report last week from CoreLogic.Though that's an improvement from the 6.6m figure from the prior quarter, many people are still not in a position to refinance at current low rates or to make a profit by selling their homes.""Based on what I see, people are staying where they are - spending money on their house,"" said Chris Gavin, a partner at Perkins Coie. ""HELOCs make sense for a variety of people."" SHIFTING RISK Even if investors can be won over, and loan volumes do balloon, banks are still mindful of the risks following high-profile failures of previous dominant players like Countrywide and billion dollar lawsuits that tarnished the sector's reputation.Banks that opted not to securitize HELOCs, leaving them instead on their balance sheet, also suffered losses estimated at US$77bn since the financial crisis, according to Trepp data, mainly because little trickles down to this type of second lien if a borrower defaults on its first mortgage.""If nothing is left over at foreclosure, it is a total loss,"" said Kunkle.But the hope of offloading HELOCs from balance sheets is likely to prove too tempting eventually, especially as the average profit lenders make on first mortgages has steadily dropped.The fourth quarter saw a new low of US$150 per loan per quarter, down from US$391 in the prior quarter, according to data from the Mortgage Bankers Association.Meanwhile, efforts are under way to make this a safer product.Wells Fargo in May said it would change its HELOC business by charging interest or a minimum payment each month that would pay down principal.Another safeguard is that banks are now only making HELOC loans to customers they already know.The strategy is expected to hold up better than pre-crisis practices, where third-party originators pushed as many borrowers as possible into HELOCs, regardless of whether that type of loan was suitable or not.""There is zero correspondent HELOC lending going on now,"" Kunkle said.

147,"  June 11 Bank of America Corp and the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) have reached an impasse in negotiating a multibillion-dollar settlement deal related to the bank's mortgage investments, the New York Times reported, citing people briefed on the matter.The talks stalled on Monday after the bank's latest offer of more than $12 billion to resolve state and federal investigations into its sale of mortgage investments fell far short of prosecutors' demands, the newspaper said.On Tuesday, as Bank of America sought to continue negotiations, the Justice Department moved to put the finishing touches on a civil complaint against the bank, the report said, citing the people. (r.reuters.com/nuk99v) The lawsuit, which is not imminent, is expected to accuse the bank of selling mortgage investments that led to billions of dollars in losses. Reuters reported in April that Bank of America said in an annual regulatory filing that a U.S. Attorney's office advised the bank it would recommend the Justice Department bring a civil case against its affiliates over mortgage bonds. The second-largest U.S. bank faces multiple government probes over the underwriting, sale and securitization of residential mortgage bonds before the financial crisis.Representatives for Bank of America and the DoJ did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment outside regular U.S. business hours.

148,"   By John Peragine and Aruna Viswanatha | ASHEVILLE N.C.  ASHEVILLE N.C. A federal judge on Wednesday said he would consider dismissing a U.S. Department of Justice lawsuit accusing Bank of America Corp of civil fraud in the sale of mortgage securities that soured during the global financial crisis.While not issuing a formal ruling, U.S. District Judge Max Cogburn said he had concerns and indicated at a hearing in Asheville, North Carolina that he might adopt the recommendation of a federal magistrate judge for a dismissal of the fraud claims tied to the $850 million sale of securities.""DOJ may not have the evidence to try this as a fraud case,"" Cogburn said.Cogburn's skepticism comes at a crucial time, as the second-largest U.S. bank negotiates with the Justice Department and other federal and state authorities to potentially pay more than $12 billion to resolve a range of probes into its sale of mortgage securities that quickly imploded.Cogburn also told assistant U.S. Attorney Daniel Ryan that the government needed to provide more substantial information to support its case. While the case from the U.S. Attorney's office in Charlotte is not a major factor in Bank of America's negotiations, it has added further pressure on the bank as it seeks to put a range of mortgage-related liabilities stemming from the financial crisis behind it. In announcing the lawsuit, Attorney General Eric Holder had said it reflected the Justice Department's ongoing efforts to ""hold accountable those who engage in fraudulent or irresponsible conduct.” TWO CASES In March, U.S. Magistrate Judge David Cayer recommended dismissal of the lawsuit, saying that the case did not fit the statutes the government relied on in bringing it. Civil prosecutors in Charlotte had charged Bank of America under a civil fraud law, FIRREA, which requires it to reference criminal statutes that it believes are implicated. The lawsuit references two criminal laws, including one that bars false statements to government agencies and is often used to prosecute people accused of covering up a crime. It also referred to another law which Cayer said only applied to traditional customer-related bank activities such as loans, and not securities.On Wednesday, Cogburn said he would consider allowing the Justice Department to amend its complaint. Cogburn also considered a related lawsuit the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission brought against Bank of America, which Cayer had recommended should proceed. At the hearing Cogburn said he had not yet made a final decision but was inclined to uphold Cayer's recommendation on the SEC lawsuit. He also said the SEC case could help make investors whole even if the Justice Department's case was ultimately dismissed.",2014-06-12,BAC,"Wed Jun 11, 2014 | 8:56pm EDT",Judge considers dismissing U.S. fraud case against Bank of America,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-bankofamerica-mortgages-lawsuit-idUSKBN0EM2I820140612?type=companyNews
149,"  NEW YORK Bank of America Corp has become the first big bank to agree to use a New York regulator's database to ensure it does not process illegal payments from payday lenders to state residents, Governor Andrew Cuomo said on Monday. New York outlaws payday lending, or short-term consumer loans that mature the day the borrower receives his or her paycheck. New York's Department of Financial Services began clamping down on such lenders in 2013 because the interest rates they charge can be high enough to be considered predatory. Some lenders have tried to sidestep the prohibition by offering the loans over the Internet and using electronic payment and debit networks to collect on them.  To clamp down on this practice, the Department of Financial Services developed a database that identifies companies that may run afoul of the state's ban on payday lending. Bank of America plans to use this database to determine whether its merchant customers are using their bank accounts to make or collect on payday loans.     Benjamin Lawsky, New York's Superintendent of Financial Services, said in a news release that the regulator would be looking to craft similar agreements with other banks in the coming weeks.

152,"   By Jonathan Stempel  Bank of America Corp's Merrill Lynch unit was fined $8 million and will reimburse $24.4 million to customers to settle allegations that it overcharged more than 47,000 retirement accounts and charities that invested in mutual funds.The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Wall Street's self-funded regulator, on Monday said the restitution is in addition to $64.8 million that Merrill has already repaid, making the total payout about $97.2 million including the fine.Like many rivals, Merrill has offered mutual fund shares in multiple classes. Typically, Class A shares carry lower fees than Class B and C shares, but also carry upfront sales charges.FINRA said Merrill failed to provide promised sales charge waivers on many retirement accounts for more than five years beginning in January 2006, relying instead on financial advisers it did not properly supervise to do so. As a result, about 41,000 small business retirement plans, and 6,800 charities and 403(b) retirement plan accounts available to ministers and public school employees, improperly paid sales charges on Class A shares or bought other share classes carrying higher fees, FINRA said.Roughly 16,200 of these accounts will share in the $24.4 million payout, settlement papers show. ""Investors must be able to trust that their brokerage firm will offer the lowest-cost share classes available to them,"" FINRA enforcement chief Brad Bennett said in a statement.Merrill neither admitted nor denied FINRA's charges in agreeing to settle. A spokesman, Bill Halldin, said Merrill notified FINRA and voluntarily began making refunds after discovering the matter, which did not affect individual brokerage accounts or individual retirement accounts.Bank of America is based in Charlotte, North Carolina, and bought Merrill on Jan. 1, 2009.

154,"   By Mike Stone and Greg Roumeliotis  William Egan, a Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAC.N) top investment banker for financial institutions, has resigned to join credit investment and private equity firm Oaktree Capital Group LLC (OAK.N), according to people familiar with the matter.The move from a major investment bank to an alternative asset manager illustrates the growing appeal of non-bank financial firms to finance professionals as new financial regulations after the 2008 financial crisis reshape Wall Street's competitive landscape.Egan has left his job as co-head of Bank of America's global financial institutions group to join Oaktree, the people said on Tuesday. Egan is joining Oaktree for a leadership role in a new life reinsurance company, some of the people added.Alternative asset managers are often keen to manage the assets of life insurance and reinsurance firms because the liabilities of these firms are seen as a good fit for the returns of their credit portfolios. An internal Bank of America memo sent by Karim Assef, head of global investment banking coverage, and seen by Reuters, named Jim O' Neil, who was co-head of global financial institutions alongside Egan, as the sole head of that business.The sources asked not to be identified because Egan's move is not public. Egan could not be immediately reached for comment while Bank of America and Oaktree declined to comment.Egan joined Merrill Lynch in 1999 as head of its insurance investment banking practice. He was previously with Credit Suisse First Boston. He was appointed Bank of America's global head of financial institutions in 2009. Rob Giammarco and Gary Swidler are co-heads of the Americas financial institutions group and Michael Frieser runs the financial institutions group in Europe, Middle East and Africa for Bank of America.Los Angeles-based Oaktree had $86.2 billion in assets under management as of the end of March, the majority of which were in private and public corporate debt. Unlike its credit investment rival Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), which manages $59.2 billion on behalf of its life insurance and reinsurance company Athene Holding Ltd, Oaktree has yet to announce any plans for such a venture.(The story was refiled to drop extraneous word ""America's"" in paragraph 5.)

159,"   By Jed Horowitz | NEW YORK  NEW YORK After a steady reduction in its brokerage force, Merrill Lynch is again adding numbers to its ""Thundering Herd.""""We want to grow,"" John Thiel, the head of US Wealth Management and Private Banking at Merrill Lynch, said at Reuters Global Wealth Summit on Tuesday. ""We have market-share opportunity.""Merrill Lynch, once the largest U.S. securities firm as measured by its sales force, ended the first quarter with 13,725 financial advisers, down almost 15 percent since it was bought by Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) during the financial crisis in January 2009.  Morgan Stanley, the world's biggest brokerage measured by sales force, employed 16,426 financial advisers as of March 31, while Wells Fargo Advisors had just over 15,000.Thiel cautioned that recruiting will be ""very selective"" and growth will be ""thoughtful,"" but confirmed that expanding the force is a shift. Headcount at Morgan Stanley is ""trending up somewhat but is not significant,"" Greg Fleming, the head of Morgan Stanley's wealth management group, said at the Summit on Monday.  Indeed, Morgan Stanley expects its wealth management compensation ratio to fall ""as we grow our revenue, are more selective on recruiting and have more attrition,"" Fleming said.  Thiel separately said that Merrill Lynch continues to shift ""mass affluent"" clients who keep less than $250,000 with the firm from the brokerage unit to lower-service call centers and Bank of America's no-frills Merrill Edge unit.  Like most of its big-brokerage rivals, Merrill no longer pays its advisers for servicing client households with less than $250,000 and is not accepting any new mass affluent clients.

The awards, which were handed out in a ceremony at London's Guild Hall, are significant badges of honour in the industry as they are based on the votes of thousands of industry insiders.Strong votes can secure bragging rights for winning firms and, for highly rated individuals, can result in lucrative job offers and pay rises.In a repeat of 2013's results, Bank of America Merrill Lynch scooped the prize for leading pan-European brokerage in equity and equity-linked research, ahead of 12-time winner UBS . Morgan Stanley remained in third place. JPMorgan Asset Management was joined in the top three in the best fund manager category by Wellington Management and Fidelity Worldwide Investment, which last year placed fifth and fourth respectively.Among individual prize winners was Andrew Wood of Sanford C. Bernstein, who for the eighth consecutive year took home the trophy for leading pan-European equity analyst.JPMorgan Asset Management's Peter Lawrence reclaimed the title of top fund management individual from Philip Guest of UBS Global Asset Management, who came second. Niels Pecriaux, of GLG Partners, climbed nine places to finish third in that category.GLG Partners was for the second straight year named top hedge fund, with Tudor Capital in second. Moore Capital Management jumped from sixth to third.The awards also cover companies' investor relations teams. Germany's Deutsche Telekom took the top spot, followed by Swiss drugmaker Roche and French media and telecoms group Vivendi.The Extel awards are based on a survey conducted by Thomson Reuters between the end of March and early May. This year attracted a record level of participation, with more than 16,000 individuals from around 6,300 brokerages, fund managers, research houses and major European companies taking part.WeConvene, a web-based platform that allows the investment community access to companies, said on Monday it had agreed to acquire Extel from Thomson Reuters in a deal expected to close by the end of June.

161,"   By Karen Freifeld | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Institutional investors including BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) and Allianz SE's Pimco (ALVG.DE) on Wednesday sued six of the largest bond trustees, accusing them of failing to properly oversee more than $2 trillion in mortgage-backed securities issued in the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis.The lawsuits, filed in New York state court, claim the trustees breached their duties to investors by failing to force lenders and sponsors of the securities to repurchase defective loans, the suits claim.The investors are seeking damages for losses that exceed $250 billion and relate to over 2,200 residential mortgage-backed securities trusts issued between 2004 and 2008, according to a person familiar with the cases.The trustees that were sued include units of U.S. Bank (USB.N), Citibank (C.N), Deutsche Bank [DBKGN.UL], Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC.N), HSBC [HSBCUK.UL], and Bank of New York Mellon. Representatives for the banks declined comment or did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The lawsuits come after a New York appeals court ruling in December that determined the six-year statute of limitations to bring breach-of-contract cases against the issuers of mortgage securities began when the transactions were executed. The ruling means that for many cases it is too late to sue.  The lawsuits claim the trustees disregarded their duties to protect investors despite knowing that the trusts held a large number of loans that did not meet their contractual obligations.    The trustees were aware of an ""industrywide abandonment of underwriting guidelines"" for the loans and ""pervasive and systemic deficiencies infecting the trusts' collateral,"" as the complaint against Citibank says. Banks have paid billions of dollars in lawsuits and settlements since being accused of packaging shoddy mortgages into securities that helped lead to the financial crisis.The bonds at issue here have not been included in similar cases including an $8.5 billion accord between investors and Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) and a $4.5 billion deal between investors and JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) over mortgage-backed securities, the person familiar with the lawsuits said.In addition to BlackRock and Pimco, the lawsuits were filed on behalf of Charles Schwab Co, DZ Bank AG and other institutional investors.

Clients who have at least $20,000 in deposits and investments at the bank will be eligible for the benefits, according to an advance announcement reviewed by Reuters. The changes will be phased in starting this week.Previously, the threshold was a minimum of $50,000 in deposits and investments.The bank is offering lower rates on mortgages and home equity loans, higher interest rates on savings accounts and free stock trades to members of its new ""preferred rewards"" program.The new benefits are part of Chief Executive Brian Moynihan's push to broaden the array of products and services to current customers as the bank struggles to boost overall revenue. He has pressed executives in different parts of the bank to work together to sell, for example, brokerage services to investment banking customers. Among the areas of focus are households with some savings, but not enough wealth to be served by brokers at Bank of America's Merrill Lynch unit, or private bankers at its U.S. Trust unit. In 2011, Bank of America set up a ""preferred banking"" group to focus on these customers, known as ""mass affluent."" As part of this effort, the bank has hired thousands of investment advisers within its retail branches and developed Merrill Edge, an online brokerage focusing on the mass affluent that has amassed $100 billion in assets under management in four years.  ""We have re-pivoted our entire organization on these clients to better serve them,"" said Dean Athanasia, the executive in charge of preferred and small business banking.Other banks look to attract these customers, too.

Mass-affluent customers hold $600 billion in assets at the Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank, and they also hold $5 trillion in assets at other financial institutions, which represents a ""huge opportunity,"" he added.

172,"   By Dena Aubin  A federal judge has dismissed the city of Miami's mortgage discrimination lawsuit against Bank of America Corp, handing the city its first defeat in four suits that accuse major banks of U.S. Fair Housing Act violations.In a ruling on Tuesday that could affect similar legal actions by other localities, U.S. District Judge William Dimitrouleas said Miami did not have standing to sue under the 1968 law, passed to prevent discrimination and assure fair housing nationwide.Wells Fargo & Co, Citigroup Inc and JPMorgan Chase & Co are also facing lawsuits by Miami for allegedly targeting minorities for subprime loans that defaulted en masse during the last decade's housing crisis.The ruling could also have implications for at least a dozen similar suits filed by U.S. cities and counties, including Los Angeles; Miami Gardens, Florida; and DeKalb County, Georgia.""We believe the correct determination was made in the Miami case,"" Bank of America spokesman Rick Simon said. ""We responded with urgency to rising mortgage defaults that resulted from the country's severe economic downturn, which the Miami suit all but ignored,"" he said. Lawyers and a spokesman for the city of Miami did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Miami had accused the banks of giving minorities loans they could not afford, which the city said led to foreclosures, lower property values and neighborhood blight.    The city sued to recover lost property tax revenue and increased expenses for the city in neighborhoods with vacant properties.    The damages are ""so marginally related"" to the purpose of the Fair Housing Act that it cannot be assumed that Congress intended to permit the city's lawsuit, the judge ruled.The city's alleged harm was also too remote from the bank's conduct to bring a suit, the judge said.""Against the backdrop of a historic drop in home prices and a global recession,"" the city had not traced foreclosures to Bank of America's actions, the judge said.  LEADER IN ZOMBIE FORECLOSURES Filed in December, the lawsuit accused Bank of America of a ""continuous pattern and practice of mortgage discrimination in Miami"" since at least 2004.  The lawsuit said Florida, and Miami in particular, had been devastated by the foreclosure crisis. As of October 2013, Florida had the country's highest foreclosure rate, and Miami had the highest rate among the 20 largest metropolitan statistical areas in the country, according to the lawsuit.Florida was by far the leading state in the country with owner-vacated, or ""zombie,"" foreclosures, the suit said. In Tuesday's ruling, Dimitrouleas said Bank of America was not responsible for the actions of ""intervening actors such as squatters, vandals or criminals that damaged foreclosed properties"" and caused the city's costs to rise. The case is: City of Miami v Bank of America Corp, U.S. District Court, Southern District of Florida, No 13-24506.

Porritt was himself last month hired from UBS. Fierce demand for investment bankers expert in advising financial clients has triggered a string of such hires in Asia this year. In the first half, the financials sector captured 17 percent of equity issued with $14.9 billion raised, ahead of industrials, while in M&A financials accounted for 21 percent of announced deals, Thomson Reuters data showed.Bank of America is advising Singapore's Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp Ltd on its $5 billion acquisition of Wing Hang Bank Ltd announced in April - the largest Singapore cross-border FIG M&A since 2001.

179,"   By Peter Rudegeair and Tanya Agrawal  Bank of America Corp said second-quarter profit fell 43 percent, a bigger decline than analysts had expected, after the bank posted $4 billion of litigation expenses linked to mortgage disputes following the financial crisis.The expenses included a $650 million settlement with American International Group and money it set aside for an expected settlement with the Department of Justice. Bank of America has already agreed to pay $50 billion to settle disagreements stemming from the market meltdown in 2008.The bank's shares fell 1.9 percent to $15.50 in early afternoon trading.The expenses far exceeded the $471 million in legal charges the bank posted in last year's second quarter, although it was less than the $6 billion it recorded in this year's first quarter.Higher legal costs overshadowed the increased profits that many of the bank's main businesses posted. Retail banking earnings, including credit cards, rose 28.5 percent to $1.79 billion. Commercial and investment banking profit rose 4.3 percent to $13.5 billion, thanks in part to a record quarter in underwriting equities.""The sins are seven years old and the things that are going on in the future look bright,"" said Bill Smead, chief investment officer of Smead Capital Management, a Seattle-based investment firm that owns around 2.6 million shares in Bank of America. Sales and trading profit jumped 14.44 percent to $1.1 billion, helped by a 5 percent increase in revenue in bond trading to $2.4 billion, excluding an accounting adjustment. Higher revenues in trading corporate, mortgage and municipal bonds help Bank of America avoid the double-digit declines in bond trading that rivals JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N and Citigroup Inc C.N experienced.The second-largest U.S. bank said on Wednesday that earnings for common shareholders fell to $2.04 billion, or 19 cents per share, in the three months ended June 30 from $3.58 billion, or 32 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected earnings of 29 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

180,"  (Adds Triaxx and Bank of New York Mellon declined to comment, case background)By Karen FreifeldNEW YORK, July 16 Bank of America Corp  agreed to pay the insurer American International Group Inc  $650 million to settle long-running legal disputes over defective mortgage-backed securities that the bank sold in the run-up to the financial crisis.The settlement which the parties announced on Wednesday ends securities fraud litigation brought by AIG against the bank.It also removes the biggest obstacle to the bank's $8.5 billion settlement with investors in mortgage securities issued by Countrywide Financial Corp, the mortgage lender Bank of America acquired in July 2008. AIG agreed to dismiss litigation in New York and California that accused the bank of fraudulently causing billions of dollars in losses by selling it shoddy mortgage securities. It originally sought $10 billion of damages in the New York case.For the past three years, AIG has also led opponents of Bank of America's $8.5 billion settlement in June 2011 with institutional investors to resolve claims that Countrywide misrepresented the quality of home loans underlying $174 billion of mortgage-backed securities it issued before the housing crisis.Twenty-two institutional investors, including BlackRock Inc , Allianz SE's Pimco and Metlife Inc  had agreed to the settlement, with the Bank of New York Mellon Corp serving as trustee. AIG claimed the settlement undervalued its claims, and had been appealing January's approval by Justice Barbara Kapnick in New York state court of the bulk of the settlement.In agreeing to drop its appeal, AIG said it will accept a pro rata share of whatever investors recover. A group of funds known as Triaxx and a pension fund for Chicago police remain as objectors. A spokesman for Bank of New York Mellon declined to comment. A lawyer for Triaxx declined to comment, while a lawyer for the Chicago pension fund did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Bank of America said it had set aside reserves by June 30 for the $650 million settlement, which also resolves three actions it brought to collect mortgage insurance proceeds from AIG's United Guaranty unit on loans it had originated and serviced.The cases are American International Group Inc et al v.

182,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, July 16 (Fitch) Bank of America Corporation's (BAC) stated second  quarter 2014 (2Q'14) earnings of $2.3 billion were impacted by $4 billion of  litigation charges, after having absorbed $6 billion of litigation charges in  the sequential quarter.  This latest charge masked what Fitch Ratings believes  is some of the progress BAC has made in streamlining its franchise and improving  its businesses.  As such, notwithstanding the continued--and  significant--litigation costs, Fitch views the quarter's results as  incrementally positive. Fitch calculated pre-tax profits, which excluded CVA/DVA adjustments and various  other gains/losses and charges amounted to $2.9 billion in 2Q'14, which equated  to a 0.54% pre-tax adjusted return on assets, which is modestly better than the  0.46% pre-tax adjusted return on assets including both of last quarter's  charges. For comparison purposes, excluding the $4 billion of legal charges this  quarter would yield a 1.28% adjusted return on assets, which Fitch views as  good. Should BAC begin at some point to experience significantly lower  litigation costs, the earnings power of the company's strong franchises will be  more evident. Fitch continues to believe that over a longer period of time as BAC eventually  incurs fewer litigation costs and continues to execute on its efficiency  initiatives, it's possible for the company's earnings to approach peer levels  and to also come closer to Fitch's estimate of BAC's long-term cost of equity  assumption.  Drivers of the company's earnings this quarter included lower provisioning in  the Consumer & Business Banking (CBB) segment, continued cost reductions from  Legacy Asset Servicing (LAS) in the Consumer Real Estate Services (CRES)  segment, lower representation and warranty expense in CRES, continued strength  in Global Wealth and Investment Management (GWIM) amid higher markets, somewhat  stable results in Global Banking (GB), and comparatively satisfactory results in  Global Markets (GM). GM has been a source of weakness for many banks amid low volatility and slowing  client volumes. BAC was not immune to these market conditions relative to the  sequential quarter in both Fixed Income Currency & Commodities (FICC) and in the  equities trading business. FICC revenue, however, modestly increased relative to  the year-ago quarter as better performance in mortgage trading and municipals  was partially offset by a decline in foreign exchange (FX) trading and in  providing derivatives for commodities exposure. Despite continuing to have elevated overall expenses, management continues to  make efforts to drive down costs. In 2Q'14, this included further headcount  reductions primarily in the LAS group, continued rationalization of the  company's branches which declined by another 72 from the sequential quarter, and  an acceleration of quarterly cost savings of $2 billion from New BAC initiatives  which the company now expects to be fully realized by 4Q'14.  These expense  savings are critical, as they remain one of the key levers management can pull  to improve future earnings performance. BAC's overall loan portfolio declined relative to the sequential quarter due to  a mix of the continued resolution of troubled assets and some loan sales. BAC's  overall asset quality metrics continue to improve and Fitch expects this to  continue over a near-term time horizon. However, industrywide, Fitch continues  to believe that credit quality is near a cyclical trough and that over an  intermediate to longer-term time horizon, there should be some reversion in  asset quality measures, particularly in commercial lending. BAC's liquidity position remains sound given its strong deposit franchise and  its increase in Global Excess Liquidity Sources, which now amount to $431  billion.   BAC's capital position also improved. BAC's Basel III Tier 1 common equity ratio  under the standardized approach (BAC's binding constraint under Basel III)  increased to 9.5% in 2Q'14, up from 9% in the sequential quarter. This was due  to a mix of higher earnings and improvements in accumulated other comprehensive  income (AOCI) as well as lower risk-weighted assets (RWA).   While Fitch views this favorably, it also notes that higher litigation costs  over time have constrained much of BAC's potential growth in capital, which  could still occur over the near term given the currently outstanding legal  issues facing the company. Additionally, BAC is in compliance with supplementary leverage ratio (SLR)  proposals at both the holding company and main operating subsidiaries in the  U.S. Contact: Primary Analyst Justin Fuller, CFA Senior Director +1-312-368-2057 Fitch Ratings, Inc. 70 W Madison Street Chicago, IL 60602 Secondary Analyst Julie Solar Senior Director  +1-312-368-5472 Media Relations: Brian Bertsch, New York, Tel: +1 212-908-0549, Email:  brian.bertsch@fitchratings.com.

190,"   By Aruna Viswanatha | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Bank of America Corp's banking unit (BAC.N) agreed to pay $16.6 million to resolve allegations that it processed several hundred transactions for drug traffickers who are subject to U.S. sanctions, the U.S. Treasury Department said on Thursday.The bank processed around $91,000 in transactions for six designated narcotics traffickers between 2005 and 2009, and failed to file timely reports on accounts owned by four others, the department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) said.Bank of America spokesman Lawrence Grayson said the settlement concluded a matter the bank addressed in 2009 by improving its sanctions-related systems and controls. In announcing the settlement, OFAC said it determined that 79 transactions the bank processed after October 2006 constituted an ""egregious"" case, because the bank knew of a problem with its screening tool, but didn't fix it until more than two years later.

The bank processed around $91,000 in transactions for six designated narcotics traffickers between 2005 and 2009, and failed to file timely reports on accounts owned by four others, the department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) said.Bank of America spokesman Lawrence Grayson said the settlement concluded a matter the bank addressed in 2009 by improving its sanctions-related systems and controls. In announcing the settlement, OFAC said it determined that 79 transactions the bank processed after October 2006 constituted an ""egregious"" case, because the bank knew of a problem with its screening tool, but didn't fix it until more than two years later.

205,"   By Douwe Miedema and Emily Stephenson | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON U.S. regulators warned Wall Street banks on Tuesday to improve plans that spell out how they would avoid taxpayer bailouts during a future crisis or face tough repercussions, including being forced to break up their businesses.Six years after the financial crisis, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp and Federal Reserve said the so-called living wills 11 big banks submitted last year were overly optimistic, allowed banks to be too complex, and would not enable them to go through bankruptcy without government support.""The plans provide no credible or clear path through bankruptcy that doesn't require unrealistic assumptions and direct or indirect public support,"" said Thomas Hoenig, second in command at the FDIC.The 11 banks sent in living wills for the third time this year, laying out how they could enter bankruptcy without causing the mayhem that triggered costly government bailouts in 2008.These plans, often thousands of pages thick, range from mundane data as where to reach key staff to complex discussions of how to unwind legal entities in the United States and abroad.But the FDIC said on Tuesday it had decided the second set of plans, submitted in 2013, were ""not credible."" The Fed did not take quite as harsh a tone, but both warned that the plans needed considerable work. Banks also submitted a round of living wills in July 2014, but regulators were still evaluating the previous submission. Their comments on Tuesday only covered the 2013 documents.If banks' 2015 plans do not address the criticisms, both agencies said they would declare that the plans did not meet the requirements of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act.Firms would have a formal period to correct problems if their living wills were deemed deficient by both regulators, who could then tell banks to cut down their business after two years if things did not improve, a senior Fed official said. The regulators did not publicly disclose problems with individual 2013 plans, although they sent the banks private letters spelling out the issues. The submissions included unrealistic assumptions about the likely behavior of customers and others and failed to identify the changes in the structure of their firms that would enable such an ""orderly resolution,"" the regulators said.They said the banks across the board need to simplify legal structures and change financial contracts to avoid an exodus of trading partners during insolvency.     The banks also need to develop a holding company structure to support resolvability, make sure that they could continue to use shared services during insolvency, and work on producing reliable data quickly, the Fed and FDIC said.Banks had complained they did not get enough feedback from regulators on the living wills. Regulators' tough language surprised some industry observers on Tuesday.""It would seem to be incongruous to make a determination of 'not credible' without having provided feedback really on the first or second times companies filed their plans,"" said Mike Krimminger, a former FDIC official who is now a partner at Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton in Washington. Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Bank of America Corp, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase & Co, Citigroup Inc, Barclays PLC, Deutsche Bank AG and Bank of New York Mellon Corp declined to comment. Calls to Credit Suisse Group AG, State Street Corp and UBS AG were not immediately returned.

206,"  Bank of America Corp BAC.N said on Wednesday the Federal Reserve has approved its plan to raise its quarterly dividend for the first time since the financial crisis.The bank's shares rose as much as 2.4 percent after Bank of America said it would increase its quarterly dividend to 5 cents per share from 1 cent.The dividend increase is the latest step toward normality for a bank that is still trying to move past the financial meltdown. But the dividend would still be far below its pre-crisis level.In 2006, Bank of America paid out about 45 percent of its earnings as common share dividends. Based on analysts' average forecasts for the bank's earnings for the next four quarters, it would be paying out closer to 10 percent of its earnings as common-share dividends under the just-approved plan. The bank won approval to increase its dividend only after having its prior proposals for the 2014 process rejected twice. The Fed nixed the bank's first request because it was too high, and its second request because the bank found a mistake in the way it accounted for its liabilities for regulators that ended up cutting its capital levels, or its assets minus liabilities.In its second attempt, the bank sought to buy back another $4 billion of shares and to spend about an extra $1.5 billion a year on its dividend. For its third request, it only sought to boost its dividend. Raising the dividend has been a top priority for Chief Executive Brian Moynihan. Prior to the crisis, the bank paid a quarterly dividend of as much as 64 cents per share, a level that it cut in half for the fourth quarter of 2008 and then cut to a penny a share in 2009. Those high dividend payouts made bank stocks a standard holding for investors seeking income from their portfolio.Bank of America, like other major banks globally, was slow to cut its dividend as the U.S. housing market crumbled, because it did not want to signal that it was in distress. Rulemakers responded by requiring big banks to receive regulatory approval before paying out dividends. In late morning trading, the bank's shares were 1.9 percent higher, at $15.29.

216,"   By Megan Davies and Tim Reid | NEW YORK/LOS ANGELES  NEW YORK/LOS ANGELES A clutch of states including California, New York and Illinois will share in a mini-bonanza from the $16.65 billion settlement agreed by Bank of America Corp on Thursday. The settlement announced by the U.S. Department of Justice calls for the second-largest U.S. bank to pay a $9.65 billion cash penalty on charges that it misled investors into buying troubled mortgage-backed securities, and provide $7 billion of relief to struggling homeowners and communities.Six states will reap nearly $1 billion between them as well as benefiting from cash for consumer relief credits - to be put towards items such as principal reductions for certain types of Federal Housing Administration mortgages. New York and California will both get $300 million in damages, while Illinois receives $200 million, Maryland gets $75 million, Delaware gets $45 million and Kentucky receives $23 million, according to the individual states' attorneys generals.

217,"   By Aruna Viswanatha, Jonathan Stempel and Peter Rudegeair | WASHINGTON/NEW YORK  WASHINGTON/NEW YORK Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) reached a record $16.65 billion settlement with the U.S. government to settle charges that it and companies it bought misled investors into buying troubled mortgage-backed securities, helping the bank close a major chapter tied to the financial crisis.The settlement announced on Thursday by the U.S. Department of Justice calls for the second-largest U.S. bank by assets to pay $9.65 billion in cash to resolve more than a dozen federal and state investigations, and provide $7 billion in help to struggling homeowners and communities.It is expected to resolve the vast majority of the Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank's remaining liabilities tied to its purchases of Countrywide Financial Corp, once the nation's largest mortgage lender, in July 2008 and Merrill Lynch & Co, six months later.""I want to be very clear: The size and the scope of this multibillion-dollar agreement goes far beyond the 'cost of doing business,'"" U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said in announcing the settlement. Bank of America expects the accord to reduce third-quarter earnings by about $5.3 billion before taxes, or about 43 cents per share after taxes. Chief Executive Brian Moynihan has spent more than four years trying to shed Bank of America of liabilities from the purchases of Countrywide and Merrill, which were made by his predecessor, Kenneth Lewis. In a statement, Moynihan said the accord is in shareholders' best interests.“Regulators wanted a pound of flesh, and they got it,” said Joel Conn, president of Lakeshore Capital, an investment firm in Birmingham, Alabama. He said the accord, while larger than he expected, represents a “major cloud that has been lifted” from the bank.    Bank of America shares rose 31 cents, or 2.03 percent, to $15.83 in early afternoon trading. The settlement's outlines had surfaced earlier in the month, and the formal announcement may increase the chance that many of the bank's mortgage problems are behind it. BEARING THE BURDENS The settlement eclipses the respective $13 billion and $7 billion accords that JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) and Citigroup Inc (C.N) recently reached to resolve similar claims.It means Bank of America will have paid well over $65 billion to resolve mortgage issues with consumers, investors and government agencies.Some shareholders still felt as if they were bearing the costs of the mistakes of long-departed officials at Bank of America, Countrywide and Merrill.“It’s a slight disappointment to me that they settled the issue for this much money,” said Joe Terril, president of Terril & Co in St Louis, which invests $760 million and owns Bank of America shares. The government is still examining crisis-era mortgage abuses. While Bank of America's settlement is expected to be the largest, charges could still be brought against Credit Suisse Group AG CSGN.VX, Royal Bank of Scotland Plc (RBS.L) and others, people familiar with the probes have said.About $5 billion of the cash portion of the settlement is paid as a penalty to the U.S. Treasury. Other portions will go toward compensating investors, including state pensionfunds. Just under $1 billion will be split among six states, including California, New York and Illinois.MOZILO  Under the out-of-court settlement, Bank of America acknowledged that Merrill Lynch told investors in subprime mortgage bonds in 2006 and 2007 that the loans generally complied with underwriting guidelines, though reviews suggested as many as 50 percent did not. A statement of facts cites one email in which a Merrill employee wrote: ""(h)ow much time do you want me to spend looking at these (loans) if (the co-head of Merrill Lynch's RMBS business) is going to keep them regardless of issues?""Bank of America also acknowledged that Countrywide did not generally tell investors the extent to which it made exceptions to its own internal guidelines.The settlement also covered some post-crisis conduct, including Bank of America's admission that from 2009 to 2012 it submitted loans for government insurance under the Federal Housing Administration that did not qualify.No individuals were charged on Thursday.But the U.S. Attorney's Office in Los Angeles is preparing a civil fraud case against former Countrywide Chief Executive Angelo Mozilo, who previously reached a $67.5 million settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, according to a person familiar with the matter.  The settlement does not cover the $1.27 billion fraud penalty imposed last month by a federal judge over a fraudulent Countrywide mortgage scheme known as ""High Speed Swim Lane,"" or ""Hustle,"" which Bank of America is appealing.

219,"   By Peter Rudegeair | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Bank of America Corp has long argued to enforcement officials that it was being forced to pay for the sins of companies it acquired in the crisis, but on Thursday the bank admitted at least some of its mortgage problems happened on its watch.In a statement of facts that the bank agreed to as part of the settlement, Bank of America said it had sought government insurance on mortgages that did not qualify for that coverage from May 1, 2009, after the crisis had subsided. The bank failed to take basic steps that the Federal Housing Administration demanded banks to take, including verifying borrowers' income, it said.Those missteps came after the bank had acquired Countrywide Financial Corp and Merrill Lynch & Co, the two companies responsible for most of the mortgage bond problems the bank admitted to. The bank agreed to an $800 million settlement with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development for those loans, which it had sought to bundle into bonds guaranteed by the FHA. That represents a relatively small portion of Bank of America's overall $16.65 billion settlement with authorities announced on Thursday. But the facts the bank admitted to underscore that not all of its mortgage problems were inherited. A Bank of America spokesman declined to comment. In Bank of America's negotiations with the Justice Department over the broad mortgage settlement, the bank said it should have to pay less than what authorities were seeking because it was not directly responsible for most of the mortgage securities that soured, according to sources familiar with the matter [ID: nL2N0P1028]. It said it inherited much of that legal risk from Countrywide and Merrill Lynch.  ""We didn't originate the loans for Countrywide, but we ended up paying for them because we had an obligation,"" Chief Executive Brian Moynihan said at the bank's annual meeting for shareholders in May. To be sure, most of the mortgage bonds that the bank had problems with came from Countrywide, which Bank of America bought in July 2008. Countrywide issued about three-quarters of the $965 billion of mortgage bonds that Bank of America, Countrywide, and Merrill Lynch combined issued between 2004 and 2008, according to company filings. Countrywide was also responsible for three-quarters of the defaults and severe delinquencies on those loans, Bank of America said in its annual filing.  The bank admitted to specific problem loans, including a case where Bank of America refinanced a Countrywide mortgage for $156,461 into an FHA-backed mortgage bond. The home was a 27-year-old mobile home, and the borrower was delinquent on the original mortgage. Furthermore, the borrower was ""improperly permitted"" to roll $12,623 of credit card and auto debt into the new FHA loan, on which he only made two payments before defaulting, according to the statement of facts. In another, the bank extended a $314,204 FHA mortgage to a borrower with no history of paying rent without verifying his income. The borrower ended up defaulting after four payments.

222,"   By David Randall and Peter Rudegeair | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Bank of America’s decision to pay $16.7 billion to settle charges stemming from the sale of mortgage-backed securities may finally allow the company to put last decade’s housing bubble behind it, fund managers and analysts say. The Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank, the second-largest in the United States, announced Thursday that it will pay a $9.65 billion cash penalty, and provide $7 billion of relief to homeowners, to resolve the majority of its remaining liabilities connected with its purchases of Countrywide Financial Corp, once the nation's largest mortgage lender, and Merrill Lynch & Co.The size of the settlement will “wipe away another quarter’s worth of earnings,” said Marty Mosby, a bank analyst at Vining Sparks. Yet it will also free chief executive Brian Moynihan, who took over from embattled chief executive Ken Lewis, under whom the company purchased Countrywide Financial in 2008, to move the company forward, he said.“At this point most of the overhang issues related to mortgage have been dealt with, and we can start to see how he can start running the company for shareholders and not litigants,” Mosby said.Including Thursday’s settlement, Bank of America Corp has agreed to pay around $70 billion to resolve legal disputes related to the financial crisis. In contrast, JPMorgan Chase & Co has agreed to pay around $30 billion. Stephen Dodson, portfolio manager of the Bretton Fund, began buying shares of the company in late 2013 largely because he was attracted to the size of the company’s deposit banking arm. The settlement provides “a relief over the stock price” because it eliminates the uncertainty of the bank’s liabilities, he said. Shares of Bank of America were up 1.1 percent for the year to date through Wednesday’s close, slightly below the 2.2 percent gain for the KBW Bank Index over the same time. They gained 65 cents, or  4.2 percent, in afternoon trading Thursday.Prior to Thursday's announcement, shares of Bank of America traded at 0.7 times book value, a measure of the total value of the assets on a company's balance sheet. Shares of rivals such as JPMorgan Chase & Co., by comparison, traded slightly above book value,  making them more expensive by comparison. While the settlement is lifting Bank of America's shares, it may not be enough to cap a significant rally, said Dave Ellison, a portfolio manager at Hennessy Funds who owns shares in the company. ""This stock won't really work until interest rates go up a little bit,"" he said. Bank of America shares are widely held. The company is a major holding of well-known mutual funds such as Fidelity’s Contrafund and the Dodge & Cox Stock Fund that are mainstays of retirement accounts. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc, meanwhile, invested $5 billion in Bank of America in 2011 in exchange for preferred shares and warrants to purchase 700 million common shares in the bank at a price of around $7.14 each. If he exercised the warrants at the current share price, Buffett could make an immediate $6 billion profit, though he has said he has no plans to exercise them until close to their 2021 expiration date.

225,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, August 21 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings believes the settlement between Bank of  America Corporation (BAC) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) on behalf of  several governmental entities and State Attorneys General is largely neutral to  BAC's ratings (rated 'A'/'F1'/'a-' with a Negative Outlook by Fitch) at this  point. Terms of the nearly $17 billion settlement include a $5.02 billion cash penalty,  $4.63 billion in cash restitution, and $7 billion in consumer relief.. The  incremental quarterly cost of this agreement is $5.3 pre-tax, as reserves had  been built previously.  This is a sizable cost both on an accounting and a cash  basis, and Fitch believes this will likely cause BAC to post a net loss in 3Q'14  though capital ratios should remain relatively flat. BAC's Long-term IDR is driven by Fitch's view that there remains an extremely  high probability of support from the U.S. government if required. The Negative  Outlook reflects the agency's expectation that this probability is likely to  decline within one to two years given the Dodd Frank Act and progress regulators  have made on implementing the Orderly Liquidation Authority. As a result and all  else being equal, Fitch expects to downgrade the Long-term IDR to the level of  the Viability Rating (VR), rated 'a-', by 1H15. This settlement combined with BAC's other mortgage related settlements,  litigation costs, and charges over the last several years pushes BAC's overall  consideration in these various legal matters to the higher end of some of  Fitch's internal estimates of total mortgage and legal related exposure that  were compiled in the 2009/2010 time frame. Depending on what expenses, charges,  and/or settlements are included in BAC's overall litigation costs, the  cumulative total costs and losses related to litigation and losses is likely  north of $60 billion.   To the extent that other unforeseen or incremental large settlements or  litigation costs arise such that they continue to absorb earnings generation  and/or constrain capital accumulation, there could be negative pressure on the  company's VR and eventually on its IDRs. Alternatively, to the extent that this settlement with the DOJ largely resolves  much of BAC's legacy exposures and on-going litigation, and allows management to  focus more of its efforts on running and improving BAC's core businesses, this  could have longer-term positive rating implications. As stated in prior rating commentary, these implications would be predicated on  management's ability to execute on continued efficiency initiatives without the  overhang of persistent settlements and litigation costs and to drive new  business across the franchise. This should drive better earnings performance,  and combined with higher short-term interest rates at some point thereby allow  for the incremental build of retained earnings to continue to enhance the  company's capital position over a longer-term time horizon.

226,"   By Nate Raymond | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Bank of America Corp on Thursday asked a federal judge to throw out a jury verdict finding it liable for fraud over defective mortgages sold by its Countrywide unit that resulted in a $1.27 billion penalty.The bank urged U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan to rule for it as a matter of law or order a new trial, arguing that the evidence at trial did not support the jury's October 2013 verdict.Bank of America said prosecutors were required at trial to prove that loans originated by Countrywide Financial Corp in a process called ""Hustle"" that were then sold to government mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were not as good as the lender represented.""The trial evidence, even viewed in the light most favorable to the government, did not prove fraud under this standard,"" the bank's lawyers wrote. A spokeswoman for Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, whose office brought the case in 2012, declined comment. Bharara's office is expected to respond Sept. 18.The motion came a week after Bank of America agreed to a record $16.65 billion settlement with the U.S. government to settle charges that it and companies it bought misled investors into buying troubled mortgage-backed securities.While the settlement went a long way to resolving the bank's exposure to government cases and probes stemming from the financial crisis, the deal did not include the case before Rakoff, which Bank of America said it would appeal. The lawsuit centered on a program called the ""High Speed Swim Lane"" - also called HSSL or Hustle - that the government said began in 2007 at Countrywide, which Bank of America acquired in 2008.The government said the program emphasized quantity over quality, rewarding employees for producing more loans and eliminating checkpoints designed to ensure the loans' quality. Last year, a jury found Bank of America and a former mid-level Countrywide executive, Rebecca Mairone, liable for fraud.In a decision last month, Rakoff ordered Bank of America to pay $1.27 billion and Mairone to pay $1 million.The judge at that time called the Hustle program ""from start to finish the vehicle for a brazen fraud"" and said the evidence of the fraud was ""ample.""The case is U.S. ex rel O'Donnell v.

241,"   By Peter Rudegeair | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) gave up about $6 billion in annual revenue by phasing out risky consumer banking products and eliminating certain fees, but the long-term impact on profits should be minimal, a top executive said on Tuesday.The company had previously earned about $3 billion a year in punitive fees such as overdraft charges on debit-card purchases and about $3 billion a year through the sale of identity theft, payment protection and other ""add-on"" products, Thong Nguyen, head of Bank of America's mass-market retail bank, told an investor conference in Boston.The bank ended the practice of charging consumers debit card overdraft fees in 2010 and had stopped marketing add-on products by 2012.Because the products and fees can lead to higher loan losses and legal expenses, the consumer bank's income has become more stable since shedding them, Nguyen said. In the first half of this year, Bank of America's consumer and small business banking revenue was $14.8 billion, the same as the comparable periods of 2013 and 2012.  Steady revenue growth should follow, Dean Athanasia, who leads the part of Bank of America's retail business that focuses on customers with $50,000 to $250,000 of assets, said at the conference. The discontinued products also carried a legal risk. In April, the bank agreed to pay $800 million in fines and consumer relief to settle allegations of deceptive marketing of credit card add-on products. Bank of America has been able to take out more than $4 billion in costs after shrinking the businesses in which it is involved and deciding to stop trying to add new customers, Athanasia said. ""We have refocused everything into our customer base because we have more customers than anyone out there,"" Nguyen said. Bank of America serves one out of every two U.S. households.  Nguyen said it was more cost-effective to cater to existing customers. For example, acquiring a new credit card account through direct mail costs $250, while signing up a customer to one through a Bank of America branch costs only $35.

242,"   By Peter Rudegeair | NEW YORK, Sept 16  NEW YORK, Sept 16 Bank of America Corp  gave up about $6 billion in annual revenue by phasing out risky consumer banking products and eliminating certain fees, but the long-term impact on profits should be minimal, a top executive said on Tuesday.The company had previously earned about $3 billion a year in punitive fees such as overdraft charges on debit-card purchases and about $3 billion a year through the sale of identity theft, payment protection and other ""add-on"" products, Thong Nguyen, head of Bank of America's mass-market retail bank, told an investor conference in Boston.The bank ended the practice of charging consumers debit card overdraft fees in 2010 and had stopped marketing add-on products by 2012. Because the products and fees can lead to higher loan losses and legal expenses, the consumer bank's income has become more stable since shedding them, Nguyen said. In the first half of this year, Bank of America's consumer and small business banking revenue was $14.8 billion, the same as the comparable periods of 2013 and 2012.Steady revenue growth should follow, Dean Athanasia, who leads the part of Bank of America's retail business that focuses on customers with $50,000 to $250,000 of assets, said at the conference. The discontinued products also carried a legal risk. In April, the bank agreed to pay $800 million in fines and consumer relief to settle allegations of deceptive marketing of credit card add-on products.Bank of America has been able to take out more than $4 billion in costs after shrinking the businesses in which it is involved and deciding to stop trying to add new customers, Athanasia said. ""We have refocused everything into our customer base because we have more customers than anyone out there,"" Nguyen said. Bank of America serves one out of every two U.S. households.Nguyen said it was more cost-effective to cater to existing customers. For example, acquiring a new credit card account through direct mail costs $250, while signing up a customer to one through a Bank of America branch costs only $35.Nguyen and Athanasia were recently promoted to Bank of America's management team, reporting directly to Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan.

243,"  GENEVA, Sept 21 Swiss private bank Julius Baer  is interested in acquiring Coutts International, a unit of Royal Bank of Scotland, but will not get into a bidding war for the venerable British bank's overseas arm, a Swiss paper reported on Sunday.""Coutts has to be an issue for us, if only because of the name and the brand,"" Julius Baer chief executive Boris Collardi told mass-market newspaper Sonntagsblick in an interview.RBS said in August it was considering selling the international arm of Coutts in a deal that industry sources said could net it as much as $1 billion.Collardi said there had been no talks with RBS.""I'm sure RBS will contact us once they have decided what to do with Coutts,"" he said. ""We are in the comfortable position that we can wait. There are not many banks that can integrate a business of that size."" The Swiss bank would not enter an auction for Coutts International, he added, since that would simply drive up the acquisition price and would be ""a waste of time"".People familiar with the sale process have said that the international wing of the 322-year-old British private bank could be split into Asian and European parts to attract more buyers. RBS, which is 81-percent owned by the British government following a 45 billion pound rescue during the 2008 financial crisis, is under pressure to focus on lending to UK households and businesses to support Britain's economic recovery.Julius Baer has been an active acquirer, picking up Bank of America Corp's overseas wealth arm for 860 million Swiss francs two years ago and, in July, the private banking activities of Israel's Bank Leumi in Luxembourg and Switzerland for up to 70 million francs. Collardi also reiterated his rejection of talk that Julius Baer could be taken over by Credit Suisse.""There is nothing going on between us. Many of our customers have reacted very negatively,"" he told Sonntagsblick.A Julius Baer spokesman was not immediately available to comment on Sunday.

245,"   By Soyoung Kim and Greg Roumeliotis | NEW YORK, Sept 23  NEW YORK, Sept 23 U.S. drugstore chain operator Walgreen Co is exploring the sale of a majority stake in its infusion services business, in a deal that could value that division at around $1.5 billion, according to four people familiar with the matter.The Deerfield, Illinois-based company has hired Bank of America Corp to run a sale process for Walgreens Infusion Services, which has already attracted interest from private equity firms, the people said this week.On offer is a controlling stake of just over 50 percent in Walgreens Infusion Services, which has annual earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of around $105 million, one of the people added. The sources asked not to be identified because the talks are confidential. Walgreen declined to comment while a Bank of America spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.With a staff of more than 1,600 clinicians, the unit for sale offers infusion services at home and at care centers across the United States. Its infusion therapies are used for medical conditions such as bleeding disorders and serious infections. Walgreen is currently the largest U.S. provider of home-infusion services. The company solidified that position in 2010 when it swapped its long-term care pharmacy business for the home infusion business of Omnicare Inc. A deal for Walgreens Infusion Services would come after rival CVS Health Corp acquired Coram LLC, the specialty infusion services and enteral nutrition business unit of Apria Healthcare Group Inc, for about $2.1 billion in January.Walgreen has a history of working with private equity. In 2012, Walgreens acquired a 45 percent stake in European health and beauty group Alliance Boots for $6.7 billion, partnering with buyout firm KKR & Co LP and Alliance Boots Chairman Stefano Pessina, that were left owning the remainder.Last month, Walgreen said it would buy the remaining 55 percent it does not already own of Alliance Boots for $5.3 billion in cash and 144.3 million shares for a total deal of about $15 billion.

246,"   By Sarah N. Lynch and Peter Rudegeair | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Bank of America (BAC.N) agreed to pay $7.65 million on Monday to settle civil charges alleging it miscalculated its regulatory capital for years, leading to an overestimate that eventually reached billions of dollars, U.S. regulators said Monday.The bank said in April that it had discovered that it had overstated its capital levels by $4 billion, an error that caused the bank to suspend its plan to repurchase shares and raise its dividend for the first time since the financial crisis. The miscalculation stemmed from a portfolio of structured notes that the bank inherited as part of its 2009 acquisition of Merrill Lynch and went on until the bank found the error in April. The size of the penalty reflected the fact that Bank of America brought the matter to regulators' attention and took steps to correct the issue, SEC Director of Enforcement Andrew Ceresney said in a statement.  A Bank of America spokesman declined to comment on the settlement.  Bank of America hired a third party to review its capital-planning processes before it resubmitted a request to regulators in May to pay out more dividends to shareholders. The dividend increase to $0.05 per share from $0.01 per share was approved in August. Monday's settlement with Bank of America is the second case the SEC has brought against a financial institution in recent months concerning problems related to acquisitions during the financial crisis.

Additionally, Moynihan reworked the bank's board in response to regulatory pressure to add more directors with banking expertise. In August, the bank agreed to pay $16.65 billion to resolve accusations that it misled investors into buying mortgage bonds that ended up going sour, putting to bed the majority of its legal issues tied to the financial crisis.

Bank of America, which was also top underwriter in 2013, was followed by Citi, which had 264 deals totaling $24.35 billion in the first nine months of 2014. California issued the most debt in the first three quarters of the year, $5.04 billion spread across eight deals, according to the data, followed by Puerto Rico's single March sale of junk bonds totaling $3.5 billion. California is typically the largest borrower in the municipal market, and its sales in the first nine months of this year represented a 2.3 percent market share.The big sales, though, were not enough to lift issuance of municipal bonds from their doldrums, as total issuance was down  9.8 percent from the same period in 2013. Assured Guaranty insured the most municipal bonds, backing $7.4 billion debt in the first nine months of the year, the data showed.After the financial crisis, when many insurers lost their AAA ratings, the number of guaranteed bonds dwindled. Recently, though, interest in insurance has ticked up. Insurers backed a total of $12.78 billion in deals, 56.3 percent more than they guaranteed in the first nine months of 2013. Bank of China Ltd made a large entry into the business of providing letters of credit to municipal issuers, taking the top spot for the first nine months after providing no letters of credit through all of 2013. It gave the facilities to only two deals, totaling $459 million, but that represented nearly one-fifth of the amount of debt backed by letters of credit.Wells Fargo Bank, which had been the top provider in 2013, slipped to second, backing $225.1 million in five deals.Altogether, $2.37 billion in deals carried letters of credit, a 47.5 percent increase from the same period of 2013.

259,"   By Anna Louie Sussman | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) has clinched a deal to provide inventory and working capital financing to the biggest oil refinery on the East Coast, replacing JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) with a revamped arrangement that excludes physical supplies, according to a source familiar with the deal.The agreement with Philadelphia Energy Solutions (PES), sealed on Tuesday, will give Bank of America's commodities business one of the biggest such financing arrangements in the country, but excludes the physical oil trading and logistics operations that were part of the JPMorgan pact, the source said.In the new deal, PES will take over its own logistics and trading, a move that should help mitigate regulators' concerns about the risk of banks facing liability over an oil spill or other environmental catastrophe involving commodities.The terms and full scope of the deal were not available. Bank of America, PES and JPMorgan declined to comment.Giving up the PES deal was part of JPMorgan's year-long effort to divest its physical commodity trading operations amid mounting political and regulatory scrutiny. Late last week the bank sold the bulk of the business to trading house Mercuria for around $800 million. That deal did not include the PES contract, a landmark deal for JPMorgan back in 2012. PES, a joint venture of Carlyle Group LP (CG.O) and Sunoco Inc [SUNO.UL], had been seeking greater logistical flexibility that would allow it to take more control over its crude supply and product sales with a financier that would not compete in the trading space.The transaction is the latest sign that even as U.S. banks pivot away from physical commodities trading, they are still finding ways to participate in the global raw materials market. Bank of America will ensure payment to the refiner's suppliers and help it hedge its price risk, generating revenue through financing fees. It is a lower-margin business than a physical trading operation, but also has a lower level of overhead and personnel costs. Bank of America, which inherited a larger commodity business after buying Merrill Lynch in 2008, has not done any physical oil trading for several years, the source said. Morgan Stanley (MS.N) is in the process of selling its large physical oil trading division to Russia's Rosneft, while other banks such as Barclays (BARC.L) have opted to get out of commodities entirely.

263,"  (Corrects 21st paragraph to show it is referring to Studzinski and not Taubman, and adds a dropped word in 23rd paragraph)By Greg Roumeliotis and Paritosh BansalNEW YORK Oct 10 Blackstone Group LP said on Friday it would spin off its advisory units into a company headed by star Wall Street investment banker Paul Taubman, to avoid potential conflicts of interest in the sprawling private equity empire.The advisory business, which includes mergers and acquisitions, restructuring and private equity fundraising, will merge with a firm founded last year by Taubman, a former Morgan Stanley president who has been behind some of the biggest mergers in recent years.The new publicly traded company could be valued at $1 billion to $2 billion, a person close to Blackstone said. The tax-free spin-off is expected in 2015.The surprise move is a stark example of potential conflicts of interest that could arise in companies with unwieldy, sprawling interests and attract regulatory scrutiny.Blackstone started three decades ago as an advisory business, but has since grown into a diversified alternative asset manager with more than $300 billion under management in private equity, real estate, credit and other assets.There is no suggestion that any specific regulatory action led to Blackstone's decision. The firm said its primary business, which includes buying and selling companies and real estate assets, as well as lending to such companies and buying their debt, places restrictions on the use of its advisory arms, hindering their growth.The advisory business is a small part of the firm, accounting for about $185 million of Blackstone's total revenue of $3.7 billion in the first half of the year. Blackstone has a market value of $34 billion.Blackstone said the timing is right for the spinoff: M&A is picking up, restructuring remains an active business, private equity fundraising is on the rise, and Taubman is available.""This has the potential to unlock value for our shareholders,"" Blackstone co-founder and Chief Executive Stephen Schwarzman told analysts on a conference call. Blackstone's shares ended down 0.6 percent at $29.6 on Friday.The new company, whose name has yet to be decided, will advise companies on mergers and acquisitions as well as debt restructurings. It will also help private equity and other alternative investment funds with their fundraising efforts.Blackstone's current shareholders will own 65 percent of the new publicly listed company. Taubman, his firm's partners and Blackstone's advisory employees will own the rest.Taubman, who left Morgan Stanley in 2012 and founded his own firm last year, has been behind some of the biggest deals of the past few years. These include advising Verizon Communications Inc on its $130 billion takeover of its wireless joint venture with the UK's Vodafone Group Plc, and Comcast Corp on its $42 billion deal to buy Time Warner Cable Inc.Blackstone President Tony James approached Taubman with the idea of partnering in late spring, according to Taubman. A meeting between Schwarzman, James and Taubman soon followed. LIMITS ON GROWTH Blackstone started sensing limits to the advisory business' growth as part of the firm, as questions of potential conflicts of interest came into sharper focus after the financial crisis.During the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy in 2008, for example, Blackstone's real estate division was eyeing some of the bank's assets. As a result, Blackstone had to tell its advisory bankers not to pursue a role in what they saw as one of the most complex and interesting opportunities of the last decade.Investments of Blackstone's credit arm, GSO Capital Partners, have also curtailed its advisory arm, which ranks as the world's most active debt restructuring advisor according to Thomson Reuters data. Executives started talking about the idea over the last couple of years.Tim Coleman, who heads Blackstone's restructuring team, and Daniel Prendergast, CEO of Park Hill, will keep their roles and join the new company. Park Hill is a private equity fund placement agent that Blackstone acquired in 2005.John Studzinski, who heads the advisory business, will help with the transition, but remain at Blackstone. Studzinski joined Blackstone in 2006 and has been personally involved in many of the firm's largest advisory assignments.Studzinski, who boasts relationships with governments, corporations, pension funds and wealthy individuals across the globe, will remain on the executive committee of Blackstone and advise the firm.BORN AS AN ADVISORY SHOP Blackstone was founded by Schwarzman and the now-retired Peter Peterson in 1985 with $400,000 as an M&A advisory boutique. It was not until 1987 that the firm launched its first private equity fund, and then set up its debt restructuring business in 1991.Over the years, the advisory business has undertaken some of Wall Street's most prestigious investment banking mandates, including advising Bank of America Corp on the $5 billion investment it received from Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc and American International Group Inc  on its government bailout.Yet, in recent years, the advisory business has not been a meaningful earnings contributor to Blackstone, with other assets such as real estate investments and leveraged buyouts bringing in the bulk of the firm's profits.It is not the first time Blackstone has let a business go. BlackRock Inc was spun out of Blackstone in 1992, subsequently growing into the world's largest money manager and leading Schwarzman to public acknowledge that decision as a mistake.Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP is advising Blackstone and Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP is advising Taubman's firm, PJT Partners, on the transaction.

264,"   By Michelle Conlin | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Oct 14 Many thousands of Americans who lost their homes in the housing bust, but have since begun to rebuild their finances, are suddenly facing a new foreclosure nightmare: debt collectors are chasing them down for the money they still owe by freezing their bank accounts, garnishing their wages and seizing their assets.By now, banks have usually sold the houses. But the proceeds of those sales were often not enough to cover the amount of the loan, plus penalties, legal bills and fees. The two big government-controlled housing finance companies, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as well as other mortgage players, are increasingly pressing borrowers to pay whatever they still owe on mortgages they defaulted on years ago.Using a legal tool known as a ""deficiency judgment,"" lenders can ensure that borrowers are haunted by these zombie-like debts for years, and sometimes decades, to come. Before the housing bubble, banks often refrained from seeking deficiency judgments, which were seen as costly and an invitation for bad publicity. Some of the biggest banks still feel that way.But the housing crisis saddled lenders with more than $1 trillion of foreclosed loans, leading to unprecedented losses. Now, at least some large lenders want their money back, and they figure it's the perfect time to pursue borrowers: many of those who went through foreclosure have gotten new jobs, paid off old debts and even, in some cases, bought new homes.""Just because they don't have the money to pay the entire mortgage, doesn't mean they don't have enough for a deficiency judgment,"" said Florida foreclosure defense attorney Michael Wayslik.Advocates for the banks say that the former homeowners ought to pay what they owe. Consumer advocates counter that deficiency judgments blast those who have just recovered from financial collapse back into debt - and that the banks bear culpability because they made the unsustainable loans in the first place.""SLAPPED TO THE FLOOR"" Borrowers are usually astonished to find out they still owe thousands of dollars on homes they haven't thought about for years.In 2008, bank teller Danell Huthsing broke up with her boyfriend and moved out of the concrete bungalow they shared in Jacksonville, Florida. Her name was on the mortgage even after she moved out, and when her boyfriend defaulted on the loan, her name was on the foreclosure papers, too.She moved to St. Louis, Missouri, where she managed to amass $20,000 of savings and restore her previously stellar credit score in her job as a service worker at an Amtrak station. But on July 5, a process server showed up on her doorstep with a lawsuit demanding $91,000 for the portion of her mortgage that was still unpaid after the home was foreclosed and sold.  If she loses, the debt collector that filed the suit can freeze her bank account, garnish up to 25 percent of her wages, and seize her paid-off 2005 Honda Accord.""For seven years you think you're good to go, that you've put this behind you,"" said Huthsing, who cleared her savings out of the bank and stowed the money in a safe to protect it from getting seized. ""Then wham, you get slapped to the floor again.""Bankruptcy is one way out for consumers in this rub. But it has serious drawbacks: it can trash a consumer's credit report for up to ten years, making it difficult to get credit cards, car loans or home financing. Oftentimes, borrowers will instead go on a repayment plan or simply settle the suits - without questioning the filings or hiring a lawyer - in exchange for paying a lower amount.Though court officials and attorneys in foreclosure-ravaged regions like Florida, Ohio and Illinois all say the cases are surging, no one keeps official tabs on the number nationally. ""Statistically, this is a real difficult task to get a handle on,"" said Geoff Walsh, an attorney with the National Consumer Law Center.Officials in individual counties say that the cases, while virtually zero a year or two ago, now number in the hundreds in each county. Thirty-eight states, along with the District of Columbia, allow financial institutions recourse to claw back these funds.""I've definitely noticed a huge uptick,"" said Cook County, Illinois homeowner attorney Sandra Emerson. ""They didn't include language in court motions to pursue these. Now, they do."" ""A CURSE"" Three of the biggest mortgage lenders, Bank of America, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase & Co and Wells Fargo & Co., all say that they typically don't pursue deficiency judgments, though they reserve the right to do so. ""We may pursue them on a case-by-case basis looking at a variety of factors, including investor and mortgage insurer requirements, the financial status of the borrower and the type of hardship,"" said Wells Fargo spokesman Tom Goyda. The banks would not comment on why they avoid deficiency judgments.Perhaps the most aggressive among the debt pursuers is Fannie Mae. Of the 595,128 foreclosures Fannie Mae was involved in - either through owning or guaranteeing the loans - from January 2010 through June 2012, it referred 293,134 to debt collectors for possible pursuit of deficiency judgments, according to a 2013 report by the Inspector General for the agency's regulator, the Federal Housing Finance Agency.It is unclear how many of the loans that get sent to debt collectors actually get deficiency judgments, but the IG urged the FHFA to direct Fannie Mae, along with Freddie Mac, to pursue more of them from the people who could repay them.It appears as if Fannie Mae is doing just that. In Florida alone in the past year, for example, at least 10,000 lawsuits have been filed - representing hundreds of millions of dollars of payments, according to Jacksonville, Florida-based attorney Chip Parker.Parker is about to file a class action lawsuit against the Dallas-based debt collection company, Dyck O'Neal, which is working to recoup the money on behalf of Fannie Mae. The class action will allege that Dyck O'Neal violated fair debt collection practices by suing people in the state of Florida who actually lived out of state. Dyck O'Neal declined to comment. In Lee County, Florida, for example, Dyck O'Neal only filed four foreclosure-related deficiency judgment cases last year. So far this year, it has filed 360 in the county, which has more than 650,000 residents and includes Ft. Myers. The insurer the Mortgage Guaranty Insurance Company has also filed about 1,000 cases this past year in Florida alone.Andrew Wilson, a spokesman for Fannie Mae, said the finance giant is focusing on ""strategic defaulters:"" those who could have paid their mortgages but did not. Fannie Mae analyzes borrowers' ability to repay based on their open credit lines, assets, income, expenses, credit history, mortgages and properties, according to the 2013 IG report.  ""Fannie Mae and the taxpayers suffered a loss. We're focusing on people who had the ability to make a payment but decided not to do so,"" said Wilson.Freddie Mac spokesman Brad German said the decision to pursue deficiency judgments for any particular loan is made on a ""case-by-case basis.""The FHFA declined to comment.But homeowner-defense lawyers point out that separating strategic defaulters from those who were in real distress can be tricky. If a distressed borrower suddenly manages to improve their financial position - by, for example, getting a better-paying job - they can be classified as a strategic defaulter.Dyck O'Neal works with most national lenders and servicing companies to collect on charged-off residential real estate. It purchases foreclosure debts outright, often for pennies on the dollar, and also performs collections on a contingency basis on behalf of entities like Fannie Mae. ""The debt collectors tend to be much more aggressive than the lenders had been,"" the National Consumer Law Center's Walsh said.A big reason for the new surge in deficiency claims, attorneys say, is that states like Florida have recently enacted laws limiting the time financial institutions have to sue for the debt after a foreclosure. In Florida, for example, financial institutions now only have a year after a foreclosure sale to sue - down from five.Once financial institutions secure a judgment, they can sometimes have years to collect on the claim. In Maryland, for example, they have as long as 36 years to chase people down for the debt. Financial institutions can charge post-judgment interest of an estimated 4.75 percent a year on the remaining balance until the statute of limitation runs out, which can drive people deeper into debt.""This is monumentally unfair and damaging to the economy,"" said Ira Rheingold, the executive director of the National Association of Consumer Advocates. ""It prevents people from moving forward with their lives.""Software developer Doug Weinberg was just getting back on his feet when he got served in July with a $61,000 deficiency judgment on his old condo in Miami's Biscayne Bay. Weinberg thought the ordeal was over after Bank of America, which rejected Weinberg's short sale offers, foreclosed in 2009.""It's a curse,"" said Weinberg. ""It's still haunting me. It just doesn't go away.""

267,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, October 15 (Fitch) Bank of America Corporation's (BAC) stated third  quarter 2014 (3Q'14) earnings of $0.2 billion were impacted by the previously  announced settlement with the Department of Justice (DOJ) due to mortgage  related matters.  While some of this settlement had been reserved for earlier in  the year, this settlement along expenses for other smaller litigation expenses  amounted to $5.6 billion of litigation costs and $0.4 billion of incremental  provision in the quarter, which collectively absorbed nearly all of the  company's earnings this quarter. Fitch calculated pre-tax profits, which exclude CVA/DVA adjustments and various  other gains/losses amounted to $0.2 billion, or a 0.04% adjusted return on  assets (ROA).  For comparison purposes excluding the litigation charges/costs  noted above would yield a 1.17% adjusted ROA, which is good, though below last  quarter's 1.28% adjusted ROA excluding legal charges.  Fitch does note that  excluding the company's recurring legal expenses, management continues to make  progress on putting the company's legacy issues behind it and streamlining BAC's  operations. Should BAC's legal costs begin to abate, which given currently disclosed  outstanding legal matters Fitch views as possible, the earnings power of the  company's strong franchises will be more evident.  That said, BAC has also had  to endure a number of unforeseen legal issues over the last several years which  will continue to bear monitoring. Importantly, BAC's Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) fully phased-in ratio  under the standardized approach modestly increased to9.6% from 9.5% despite the  previously noted litigation charges primarily due to lower risk-weighted assets  (RWA).  Fitch believes the RWA decline was due to the disposition of some  non-performing loans, the paydown of some loans whose proceeds were re-invested  into lower risk-weighted securities, a reduction in low-yielding prime brokerage  loans and trading related assets, as well as other steps that further reduced  the company's balance sheet. BAC's Basel III CET1 fully phased-in ratio under the advanced approaches  decreased to 9.6% on the quarter, which is now inline with the standardized  approach, due to additions to operational risk RWA.  This increase in  operational risk RWA was due in large part to the inclusion of the  aforementioned settlement with the DOJ into the company's operational risk  calculations. During the quarter, BAC also took some balance sheet actions in preparation for  compliance with the recently final Liquidity Coverage Rule (LCR).  This included  converting some insured residential mortgage loans into agency securities,  reducing deposit balances that are less LCR friendly, and increasing the mix of  U.S. Treasuries in its securities portfolio.  Fitch continues to believe that  BAC will be in compliance with the LCR when the rule goes into effect in January  2015. While BAC's Global Banking and Global Markets businesses showed good  year-over-year growth, as expected the comparisons to the sequential quarter  were more challenging.  Fitch would also note that the sequential quarter  comparisons of these businesses also do not compare as well to some other banks  that have reported to date. Fitch continues to note that the company's Global Wealth & Investment Management  (GWIM) businesses continues to be a bright spot with good revenue growth, strong  client asset gathering, as well as a strong pre-tax margin relative to  competitors.  Fitch would expect GWIM to continue to perform well, though its  results are likely to be modestly volatile given its exposure to equity markets,  which have been more volatile as of late.  Fitch would note that BAC's management continues to make progress in reducing  its operating expenses (not including litigation costs), which Fitch believes is  a key lever management can pull to improve the company's long-term earnings  power.  These expense savings were primarily realized in the company's Legacy  Asset & Servicing (LAS) area, which Fitch would expect to continue to decline  over time, as well as through 'New BAC' initiatives. Collectively, these efforts included some headcount reductions in LAS during the  quarter as well as the continued optimization of the company's branches, which  declined by 76 branches relative to the sequential quarter. Fitch continues to believe that to the extent that these efforts are successful  and not absorbed by unforeseen litigation, it's possible for the company's  returns to approach peer levels over a longer-term time horizon and to also come  closer to Fitch's estimate of BAC's long-term cost of equity assumption of  between 10%-12%.

Net income including preferred stock dividends fell to $168 million from $2.5 billion. The bank agreed in August to pay a record $16.65 billion to resolve accusations that it misled investors into buying mortgage bonds that ended up going sour, resolving the bulk of its legal issues stemming from the financial crisis.

273,"  (Repeats with no changes to text, headline)By Peter RudegeairNEW YORK Oct 16 While Bank of America Corp  Chairman and Chief Executive Brian Moynihan has been working to end legal problems, he has also been quietly retooling the bank for a post-crisis world.He has taken more direct control over the bank's retail business and shifted executives into new positions, sources familiar with the matter said. He has ordered officials at every level of the bank to think harder about how to sell more products to existing customers, a practice that many banks have tried but few have successfully executed.Moynihan has also helped reshape the board, and his sway with directors only increased when he became chairman earlier this month, the sources said.The broad changes that he has made signal that he is planning to remain at the bank for the long haul, a minimum of five years, they said.Some investors have speculated that once Moynihan, a lawyer by training, was done with legal settlements linked to the 2008-2009 housing and financial crisis, he would head for the exits.Sources at the bank said that notion was false. Key investors fully support Moynihan as well. ""Brian has done a superb job of taking the B of A back to basics and clearing up the problems from the past,"" Warren Buffett, chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Inc, wrote in an email to Reuters. ""He is exactly the right CEO to move the company forward and has the ingredients in place to do so."" Berkshire Hathaway owns Bank of America preferred stock and warrants to buy 700 million common shares.Some media outlets have speculated that when Moynihan does leave, Tom Montag, chief operating officer, will be in pole position to take the CEO spot. The sources at the bank dismissed that speculation, noting that Montag, 57, is older than Moynihan, 55, and that Moynihan is inclined to groom younger successors.Results the bank posted on Wednesday underscore how much work Moynihan still has to do. The bank posted a $70 million loss for common shareholders, after setting aside an extra $5.6 billion to cover a settlement with the Department of Justice over shoddy bond mortgage underwriting.That settlement is only the latest in a string: since 2010, Bank of America has agreed to pay more than $70 billion to resolve legal disputes and buy back bad mortgages linked to the financial crisis. The bank's total tally of settlements seems to rise every quarter, to the chagrin of investors. While the bank is hopeful that the worst of the settlements is behind it, its latest results show that its challenges extend beyond legal costs. Its revenue is stagnant, having hovered around $21 billion per quarter since 2012.Moynihan is trying to boost the top line by selling more products to existing customers. The bank is pitching credit cards and home equity loans to its checking account holders, and is talking to its corporate borrowers about treasury and retirement-planning services.These are standard moves for the head of a retail bank, but Bank of America is trying to take them a little further. In early October, it began offering a rewards program nationally to customers who do more business with the bank. Some of the perks include discounted rates on mortgages and home equity loans and greater benefits on credit cards. That program was launched in a few markets in June in a pilot program. BIGGEST PROFIT ENGINE To help ensure that his strategy is being properly implemented, Moynihan began directly overseeing retail banking - Bank of America's biggest profit engine - earlier this year.The heads of the retail banking group, Dean Athanasia and Thong Nguyen, had been reporting to David Darnell, a co-chief operating officer who oversaw all retail-facing businesses. In August, the bank said Darnell was becoming a vice chairman, and Athanasia and Nguyen, would instead report directly to the CEO.Athanasia is co-leading the retail bank from Boston, a change for a group that had long been based in Charlotte, where Nguyen works.Moynihan sees younger executives like Athanasia and Nguyen as among his possible successors, sources said, although there is no front-runner for that role.Moynihan worked with Athanasia and Nguyen at FleetBoston, which Bank of America bought in 2004. Other FleetBoston executives have also been given top roles, including Terry Laughlin, who was chief risk officer until his appointment as president of strategic initiatives in April; Anne Finucane, the global chief strategy and marketing officer; and Christine Katziff, the bank's chief auditor.While Moynihan has reshaped the executive ranks, he has also helped shape the board: Eight of the 14 current directors, including Moynihan, have joined since he became CEO in 2010.

Potential IPOs in the queue in Brazil include those of cellphone tower operator T4U Holding Brasil SA and heavy vehicle rental company Ouro Verde Locação e Serviço SA.Representatives from JBS were unavailable. The company hired the investment-banking units of Bank of America Corp, Itaú Unibanco Holding SA, Banco Bradesco SA , Grupo BTG Pactual SA, Banco do Brasil SA , HSBC Holdings Plc and Banco Santander SA  to oversee the transaction. On Friday, veterinary products maker Ouro Fino Saúde Animal Participações SA's shares priced at the top of the suggested range after investor demand for Brazil's first IPO of the year was stronger than expected.A number of pension funds and asset management firms that could be some of the JBS Foods IPO buyers voiced election-related worries to the company and bankers, the source said. Among the concerns were the effects of a victory by President Dilma Rousseff on risk perception, as well as reduced global liquidity and a domestic recession. The benchmark Bovespa stock index tumbled 4 percent on Tuesday, the third decline in four days, after polls showed Rousseff with a slight lead. Opposition candidate Aecio Neves is seen as more business-friendly than Rousseff. JBS Foods accounted for nearly 10 percent of JBS's $40 billion in revenue last year.JBS aims to list JBS Foods on the São Paulo Stock Exchange's Novo Mercado, which has tougher corporate governance standards and requires that a company list at least 25 percent of its shares.($1 = 2.4903 Brazilian reais)   (Reporting by Guillermo Parra-Bernal; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)",2014-10-21,BAC,"Tue Oct 21, 2014 | 9:12am EDT","Brazil's JBS Foods pulls regulatory request, signaling IPO delay",http://www.reuters.com//article/brazil-ipo-jbs-foods-idUSL2N0SG0S420141021?type=companyNews
278,"  NEW YORK Wall Street's self-funded regulator said on Monday it fined Bank of America Corp's Merrill Lynch unit a total of $6 million over violations of certain short-selling rules designed to prevent market manipulation.In a short sale, a trader borrows stock and then sells it at a lower price to turn a profit. If one of the parties in a transaction does not have enough cash to pay for the position, or does not own the underlying assets that are to be delivered, the result is a ""fail-to-deliver position"" that must be closed out by borrowing or buying securities of like kind and quantity.The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) said that from September 2008 to July 2012, Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing Corp did not attempt to close out certain fail-to-deliver positions, and lacked systems and procedures in to address the close-out requirements during much of that time.   The regulator also blasted Merrill's supervisory systems and procedures. It said that from September 2008 through March 2011, Merrill's broker dealer improperly allowed the allocation of fail-to-deliver positions to clients based solely on each client's short position regardless of whether those clients caused or contributed to Merrill's fail-to-deliver position.A ""firm's failure to establish systems and procedures to properly close out its fail-to-deliver positions could have potentially negative market impact, which could harm investors,"" said Brad Bennett, FINRA's chief of enforcement. In June, FINRA fined Merrill $8 million and Merrill also agreed to reimburse $24.4 million to customers to settle allegations that it overcharged more than 47,000 retirement accounts and charities that invested in mutual funds.

If one of the parties in a transaction does not have enough cash to pay for the position, or does not own the underlying assets that are to be delivered, the result is a ""fail-to-deliver position"" that must be closed out by borrowing or buying securities of like kind and quantity.The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) said that from September 2008 to July 2012, Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing Corp did not attempt to close out certain fail-to-deliver positions, and lacked systems and procedures in to address the close-out requirements during much of that time. The regulator also blasted Merrill's supervisory systems and procedures. It said that from September 2008 through March 2011, Merrill's broker dealer improperly allowed the allocation of fail-to-deliver positions to clients based solely on each client's short position regardless of whether those clients caused or contributed to Merrill's fail-to-deliver position. A ""firm's failure to establish systems and procedures to properly close out its fail-to-deliver positions could have potentially negative market impact, which could harm investors,"" said Brad Bennett, FINRA's chief of enforcement. In June, FINRA fined Merrill $8 million and Merrill also agreed to reimburse $24.4 million to customers to settle allegations that it overcharged more than 47,000 retirement accounts and charities that invested in mutual funds.

283,"   By Karen Freifeld | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Oct 29 A group of funds that threw a monkey wrench in Bank of America Corp's proposed $8.5 billion settlement with investors in mortgage-backed securities will object to JPMorgan Chase & Co's $4.5 billion offer to settle claims over similar investments, according to the lawyer that represents them.The funds, collateralized debt obligations known as the Triaxx entities, received court permission on Wednesday to intervene in a proceeding seeking judicial approval of the JPMorgan settlement, people close to the case said.JPMorgan last year reached the $4.5 billion agreement with some 20 institutional investors in 330 residential mortgage-backed securities trusts issued by JPMorgan and Bear Stearns, which the bank took over during the financial crisis.The settlement would resolve claims over misrepresentations in the quality of mortgages packaged into securities before the collapse of the U.S. housing market.The Triaxx entities hold certificates with an original balance of some $1.5 billion in 13 of the covered trusts, according to court papers.Their claims are ""potentially worth far more than the small percentage of the $4.5 billion settlement than they would receive,"" John Moon, an attorney for Triaxx, argued in the papers, filed in New York state court in Manhattan, seeking permission to intervene. Moon later told Reuters he planned to object to the deal.Triaxx is the second investor to raise questions about the accord. On Oct. 21, the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston, which has holdings in 37 of the trusts in the proposed settlement, asked for a three-month extension of the Nov. 3 deadline to object.On Wednesday, Justice Marcy Friedman of New York state Supreme Court also allowed the bank to intervene, but did not change the deadline, people close to the case said. Friedman's chambers declined to comment. In August, trustees overseeing the securities accepted the bank's offer for the vast majority of the trusts.Some 20 investors agreed to the deal last year, including BlackRock Inc, Metlife Inc, Allianz SE's Pacific Investment Management Company, and Bayerische Landesbank.Kathy Patrick, a lawyer for the investor group, did not immediately return a call for comment. In June 2011, Bank of America reached a similar deal with an investor group in which the bank agreed to pay $8.5 billion to resolve claims involving securities issued by Countrywide Financial Corp, which Bank of America acquired in 2008.A New York judge largely approved the Bank of America deal in January, although she refused to accept a portion objected to by Triaxx, involving loan modifications.Triaxx has since dropped its opposition, as did American International Group Inc, which led objectors to the settlement in a three-year legal battle.An appeals court is still weighing the settlement on behalf of other objectors. Oral arguments were held last week.The case is In re: the application of U.S. Bank National Association, et al, New York State Supreme Court (Manhattan), No. 652382/2014.

286,"   By Peter Rudegeair | NEW YORK  NEW YORK A number of high-profile brokers have left Bank of America Corp's (BAC.N) Merrill Lynch wealth management unit in recent weeks, and top executives at the company have grown concerned enough to ask business head John Thiel to explain the departures, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.Among those who have exited are top-producing brokers like Brian and Tim Brice, who oversaw around $4.5 billion in client assets in a suburb of Detroit, and whose father had also worked for Merrill. The brothers had been with Merrill Lynch for decades, before joining Morgan Stanley in September. Raymond George, a 23-year veteran of Merrill Lynch, has also left. George joined Morgan Stanley’s office in Garden City, New York in October. Eugene Montoya, who had been at Merrill for more than 40 years, decamped in September for Wells Fargo Advisors’ office in Miami. The Brice brothers declined to comment through a Morgan Stanley spokesman. George did not return a call seeking comment, and a spokeswoman for Morgan Stanley declined to comment on his departure. Montoya did not return a call and an email seeking comment. Bank of America Chief Executive Brian Moynihan and Vice Chairman David Darnell have both asked Thiel to account for the trend of recent departures, the sources said. In an emailed statement, Darnell told Reuters, ""Being on top in every category for so long, we get used to anonymous potshots, but Merrill Lynch is doing great things with our clients and for our shareholders and John (Thiel) is doing exactly what Brian (Moynihan) and I need him to do."" Thiel did not return two calls seeking comment.  David Walker, a spokesman for Merrill Lynch’s wealth management business, told Reuters in an emailed statement, ""The facts are that advisor attrition is at historic lows and our business has never been stronger. Our results, by every measure, show we’re headed in the right direction."" The reasons for the departures of the brokers, who represent a relatively small percentage of the bank's 14,000-strong force, are unclear. While Merrill said it managed to gain 155 brokers on a net basis in the third quarter, sources said that in recent weeks the bank has been losing more brokers than it gained. In one week in October, 13 left and just one joined, one of the sources said.  Two of the sources familiar with the matter added that many of the brokers who departed had spent the majority of their careers at Merrill, while two-thirds of the additions in the third quarter were relatively inexperienced graduates of Merrill’s training program. Wealth management is one of the few areas where Wall Street banks are looking to expand or at least to hang onto staff, because the business produces relatively stable returns.  Also, more clients with assets of at least $250,000 left Merrill Lynch than joined during the third quarter, one of the sources said. Merrill's Walker said the bank has had a net gain of clients with at least $1 million of assets so far this year. He declined to give data for the third quarter for clients with $250,000 of assets or more. Walker added that average production of brokers the bank attracted since the start of the year is “substantially higher” than those brokers who have left.           THUNDERING HERD Thiel has been with Merrill Lynch since 1989, when he started as a financial adviser in Tampa, Florida. Before he took on his current role in 2011, he headed Merrill’s private banking business. Banks lose top brokers all the time, and so far the exits have not affected the wealth management and investment management unit's bottom line. That group, which includes the U.S. Trust unit in addition to Merrill’s retail brokerage, posted record revenue and profit in the third quarter. The bank's wealth management arm has long been a high-performing business. For years, Merrill Lynch brokers, known as the ""thundering herd"" because of their bull logo and their large numbers, have been among the most productive on Wall Street, in terms of revenue generated. When Bank of America executives announced that the bank was buying Merrill Lynch in September 2008, they made special note of how attractive the wealth management business was to them.The latest moves come around six months after Thiel reshuffled the top ranks in an attempt to boost productivity. Among those who left in that shake-up were Christopher DuPuy and William Cholawa, two of Merrill’s eleven national market executives who had reported directly to Thiel.

287,"  Nov 7 Bank of America Corp is still trying to get a penalty waiver from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over a $16.7 billion settlement involving bad mortgages, Bloomberg reported on Friday, citing two people familiar with the matter.BofA reached a record $16.65 billion settlement with the U.S. government to settle charges it misled investors into buying toxic mortgage-backed securities.  Securitized mortgages were a major cause of the 2007-2009 financial crisis.According to Bloomberg, BofA's lawyer, Gary Lynch, asked that additional sanctions tied to the settlement be waived. He argued the bank it is being unfairly treated compared with other firms that were given waivers in similar cases. The disagreement is over a penalty that could prevent BofA from selling investments in hedge funds, Bloomberg said. A vote on the waivers scheduled for last week was scrapped at the last minute, Bloomberg reported, citing one of the people. The SEC's staff have recommended that the commissioners approve the relief, it said. BofA could not be reached for comment outside regular U.S. working hours.

291,"   By Jed Horowitz | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Nov 13 TD Ameritrade Holding Corp  may expand into Asia if its surplus cash grows as much as it expects after U.S. interest rates start to rise, the head of the discount brokerage firm said on Thursday.The ""next big thing"" TD Ameritrade could invest in is ""geographic extension,"" Chief Executive Officer Fred Tomczyk told investors at a conference sponsored by Bank of America Merrill Lynch.""It is not an unnatural move for us to try to do it in another part of the world, particularly in Asia,"" he said, but cautioned that it would take five years or so before an overseas business contributes notably to the bottom line. He did specify when a decision might be made on overseas expansion but said TD Ameritrade's management and board are now discussing scenarios for use of excess cash.TD Ameritrade inherited a Singapore outpost with its 2009 acquisition of options brokerage firm thinkorswim. ""We are currently looking at ways in which we might expand this operation,"" spokeswoman Kim Hillyer wrote in an email. She did not say whether that was the business Tomczyk was discussing. Charles Schwab told Reuters late last year he had preliminary talks with Chinese officials about expanding his eponymous firm into Shanghai. A Schwab spokesman did not respond to requests for comment on the status of the company's efforts there.In the next 12 months, TD Ameritrade will invest exclusively in cloud computing, social media and other technology projects, Tomczyk said. Its active trading customers make more than 10 percent of their trades on mobile devices and big-data analysis helps TD Ameritrade customize its online product pitches and sites, he said. Although the thinkorswim options business fuels more than 35 percent of current revenue, Tomczyk said he has not seen attractive acquisition candidates lately. TD Ameritrade expects to continue returning some 80 percent of profit to investors through dividends and stock buybacks, he said.The company will not follow rivals into selling mortgages and other bank products. ""No disrespect to BofA,"" he said of Merrill Lynch and its parent Bank of America Corp, ""but if you knowingly become a bank today you need to have your head read.""Toronto-Dominion Bank owns just over 40 percent of TD Ameritrade, enough for Tomczyk to say he understands the intense regulatory scrutiny that banks attract.

293,"   By Lawrence Hurley | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The U.S. Supreme Court agreed on Monday to hear two cases brought by Bank of America Corp questioning whether a second mortgage on an ""underwater"" house - one with a mortgage balance exceeding its current value - can be voided during bankruptcy.Both cases the justices agreed to hear come from Florida, where many homeowners have struggled to pay their mortgages following the recent housing crisis.The homeowners in the two cases, David Caulkett and Edelmiro Toledo-Cardona, both won before the regional appeals court that oversees Florida. The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that homeowners in Chapter 7 bankruptcy can void - or in bankruptcy terms ""strip off"" - a second mortgage when the debt owed to the holder of the first mortgage is more than the property's current value.That means the lender loses its ability to foreclose on the property even if its value increases. Bank of America(BAC.N), which is the second mortgage holder in both cases, said in court papers that the approach taken by the 11th Circuit is different than other appeals courts around the country.

294,"   By Lawrence Hurley | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Nov 17 The U.S. Supreme Court agreed on Monday to hear two cases brought by Bank of America Corp questioning whether a second mortgage on an ""underwater"" house - one with a mortgage balance exceeding its current value - can be voided during bankruptcy.Both cases the justices agreed to hear come from Florida, where many homeowners have struggled to pay their mortgages following the recent housing crisis.The homeowners in the two cases, David Caulkett and Edelmiro Toledo-Cardona, both won before the regional appeals court that oversees Florida. The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that homeowners in Chapter 7 bankruptcy can void - or in bankruptcy terms ""strip off"" - a second mortgage when the debt owed to the holder of the first mortgage is more than the property's current value. That means the lender loses its ability to foreclose on the property even if its value increases.Bank of America, which is the second mortgage holder in both cases, said in court papers that the approach taken by the 11th Circuit is different than other appeals courts around the country. The bank says that potentially thousands of cases pending in lower courts could be affected by how the Supreme Court rules. A decision is due by the end of June.The cases are Bank of America v. Caulkett and Bank of America v. Toledo-Cardona, U.S. Supreme Court, Nos. 13-1421 and 14-163.

300,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, November 25 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Bank of America  Corporation's (BAC) Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A' and maintained  the Rating Outlook at Negative and reflects Fitch's expectation that the  probability that the bank would receive support from the U.S. government if ever  required is likely to decline during the next six to nine months. At the same  time, Fitch affirmed BAC's Short-Term IDR at 'F1', Viability Rating (VR) at  'a-', Support Rating (SR) at '1', and Support Rating Floor (SRF) at 'A'. A full  list of rating actions, including actions on BAC's main subsidiaries and debt  ratings, is at the end of this rating action commentary. The rating actions have been taken as part of a periodic review of the Global  Trading and Universal Banks (GTUBs), which comprise 12 large and globally active  banking groups. On balance, Fitch's outlook for the sector is stable. The 12  banks have continued to strengthen their balance sheets in 9M14. Capitalisation  has improved materially over the past two years and liquidity remains sound.  This strengthening balances continued pressure on earnings, particularly in  securities businesses, and remaining material but unpredictable exposure to  conduct and regulatory risks.  Fitch forecasts weak growth in the eurozone during 2015 while growth in the US  and UK is expected to be somewhat stronger, which should help the GTUBs with a  significant presence in these regions. Spikes in market volatility, most  recently in October 2014, show that uncertainty remains over how expectations of  rising interest rates in the US will affect financial markets. Our expectation  is that rises in interest rates will be gradual and would follow improved  prospects for the economy, which should help business volumes. Sharp and  unexpected hikes in US interest rates would likely result in increased market  volatility and, consequently, additional pressure on banks' earnings, although  we believe that the GTUBs' risk appetite has declined.  Lower risk appetite should help the banks avoid material losses on trading  positions but an adverse operating environment could result in a change of our  outlook if earnings prospects suffer materially. For eurozone-focused banks, a  prolonged deflationary scenario would put pressure on earnings and could result  in a changed rating. KEY RATING DRIVERS - IDRS, SENIOR DEBT, SR AND SRF  BAC's Long- and Short-term IDRs, SR and SRF reflect Fitch's expectation that  there remains an extremely high probability of support from the U.S. government  ('AAA'/Stable Outlook) if required. This expectation reflects the U.S.'s  extremely high ability to support its banks especially given its strong  financial flexibility, though this propensity is becoming less certain. Specific  to BAC, Fitch's view of support likelihood is based mostly on its systemic  importance in the U.S., its global interconnectedness given its size and  operations in global capital markets, significant deposit market share and its  position as a key provider of financial services to the U.S. economy. BAC's IDRs  and senior debt ratings benefit from support because BAC's VR is below its SRF. However, the momentum is gaining pace to resolve even the most complex banking  groups without significantly disrupting the financial markets and without  requiring state support. The Negative Outlook on BAC's Long-term IDR reflects  Fitch's view that there is a clear intention to reduce support for G-SIFIs in  the U.S., as demonstrated by the Dodd Frank Act (DFA) and progress regulators  have made on implementing the Orderly Liquidation Authority (OLA). The FDIC has  proposed its single point of entry (SPOE) strategy and further initiatives are  demonstrating the U.S. government's progress to eliminate state support for U.S.  banks going forward, which increases the likelihood of senior debt losses if its  banks run afoul of solvency assessments.  KEY RATING SENSITIVITIES - IDRS, SENIOR DEBT, SR AND SRF As BAC's Long-term IDR is at its SRF and Fitch does not expect an upgrade of its  VR during the next six to nine months, the sensitivities of the bank's IDR's are  predominantly the same as those for the SRF.  The SR and SRF are sensitive to progress made in finalizing the SPOE strategy  and any additional regulatory initiatives that may be imposed on the G-SIFIs,  including debt thresholds at the holding company. Fitch's assessment of  continuing support for U.S. G-SIFIs has to some extent relied upon the  feasibility of OLA implementation rather than its enactment into law (when DFA  passed). A key hurdle that remains is whether sufficient contingent capital  exists at the holding company to recapitalize without requiring government  assistance.  Fitch expects that the SPOE strategy and regulatory action to ensure sufficient  contingent capital will be finalized in the near term, but regardless of its  finalization Fitch believes that sufficient regulatory progress continues to be  made over the ratings time horizon. Therefore, Fitch expects to revise BAC's SR  to '5' and its SRF to 'No Floor' likely during the first half of 2015. A revision of the SRF to 'No Floor' would mean that BAC's Long-Term IDR would  likely be downgraded to the level of its VR, which, as it currently stands,  would mean a one-notch downgrade to 'A?'. After a revision of the SRF, the  Long-term IDR and the Outlook would be sensitive to the same factors as its VR.  A downgrade of the Long-term IDR would not necessarily lead to a downgrade of  the Short-term IDR.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - VR BAC's VR continues to be supported by good capital and liquidity positions.   Additionally, while Fitch would note that BAC's core earnings have also begun to  show some improvement, the vast majority of the company's earnings over the last  few years have been absorbed by litigation settlements and costs. To this end, over the last year BAC has reached settlements with among others  the Federal Housing and Finance Administration (FHFA) and the Department of  Justice (DOJ) over legacy mortgage related matters. These sizable settlements amounted to total consideration in excess of $25  billion over the last several quarters, though some of the liability had been  reserved for in prior years and some of it was non-cash in nature.   Nevertheless, the vast majority of BAC's earnings have been absorbed by these  large settlements as well as continued litigation costs on other matters.   Additionally, BAC also took some actions to reduce certain risk weighted assets  (RWA) to support the denominator in regulatory capital ratio calculations,  keeping relatively steady.  BAC also raised some debt to help fund these  payments. Fitch would note that while BAC does still have a number of outstanding legal  issues to still be resolved, they are all much smaller compared to the FHFA and  DOJ settlements.  As such, while Fitch would expect litigation costs to still be  a drag on BAC's overall results, it does not expect the magnitude of settlements  and litigation costs incurred in 2013 and 2014 to persist. In Fitch's view, BAC's core earnings profile continues to exhibit improvements  despite the challenging market environment and protracted low interest rate  environment.  Much of this improvement is the result of continued expense  management initiatives. This includes continuing to reduce expenses in the company's Legacy Assets &  Servicing Group (LAS), as well as having realized significant savings from 'New  BAC' initiatives, which have included streamlining processes, more effectively  utilizing technology systems, optimizing some of its branch network, and  reducing headcount to name a few. Even with the savings realized to date, Fitch believes further expense  management remains a key lever management can pull to drive future earnings  performance.  While the bulk of this is still to be realized in the LAS group,  additional cost savings are likely to arise out of the company's core operations  as well. Fitch believes that to the extent that management is successful at realizing  these cost savings over a medium-term time horizon, BAC's returns should improve  closer to peer group averages as well as Fitch's estimate of the company's  long-term cost of equity assumption of around 12%. Fitch notes that BAC has a number of strong franchises, whose strength may be  more evident without the consistent overhang of large litigation costs and  settlements as well as a somewhat bloated cost structure.  KEY SENSITIVITIES - VR As previously alluded to, longer-term positive rating momentum for the VR is  predicated on a consistent improvement in overall earnings to at least levels of  other G-SIFI institutions, all while maintaining ample liquidity and a good  capital position. Notwithstanding the impact of the reserve releases noted above on recent  earnings performance, BAC's core earnings have also been moderately volatile on  a quarterly basis given the company's large reliance on capital markets  activities. Capital markets revenue, on balance, approximates one-third of  overall revenue, and was comparatively weak in the third quarter of 2014  (3Q'14). Over time,  should management be able to execute on improving performance in the  retail banking business as well as maintain its strong performance in wealth  management, the capital markets businesses contribution to earnings could  decline and therefore add some stability to overall earnings. This could be a  positive rating factor over a longer-term time horizon. It is also worth noting that some of the potential improvement in the retail  banking business is also likely predicated on rising short-term interest rates  whenever that occurs.  BAC indicates that its interest rate risk positioning is  asset sensitive, which Fitch believes is largely supported by the company's  large retail deposit base, which given this composition has the potential to  have a larger deposit re-pricing lag than some peer banks.   That said, Fitch also notes that both the current absolute level of interest  rates and the duration of low interest rates is unprecedented by historical  standards, complicating the dynamics of positioning a balance sheet for rising  rates for all financial institutions, including BAC.   While not expected, should remaining litigation exposures or other unforeseen  charges result in a significant net earnings loss, or if the company's  regulatory or tangible capital ratios begin to meaningfully decline over a near-  to intermediate- term time horizon, the VR could be downgraded. Additionally,  should BAC's overall credit quality materially deteriorate over the near term,  or the company experience a severe and unexpected risk management failure this  could negatively impact the VR. KEY RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES - LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS BAC's uninsured deposit ratings are rated one notch higher than the company's  IDR and senior unsecured debt because U.S. uninsured deposits benefit from  depositor preference. U.S. depositor preference gives deposit liabilities  superior recovery prospects in the event of default. The ratings of long- and short-term deposits issued by BAC and its subsidiaries  are primarily sensitive to any change in BAC's IDR. This means that should BAC's  Long-term IDR be downgraded due to Fitch's evolving view of support discussed  above, deposit ratings could be similarly impacted.  KEY RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES - SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID  SECURITIES Subordinated debt and other hybrid capital issued by BAC and by various issuing  vehicles are all notched down from BAC's or its bank subsidiaries' VRs in  accordance with Fitch's assessment of each instrument's respective  non-performance and relative loss severity risk profiles.  The ratings of subordinated debt and other hybrid capital issued by BAC and its  subsidiaries are primarily sensitive to any change in BAC's VR.  KEY RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES - HOLDING COMPANY AND OPERATING SUBSIDIARY  Fitch is now considering introducing a rating differential between the holding  company and bank in the U.S. due to structural changes in the sector and the  evolving regulatory landscape, as described in the special report 'U.S. Bank  HoldCos & OpCos: Evolving Risk Profiles', dated March 27, 2014. This may result  in a possible downgrade of BAC's holding company rating, an upgrade of operating  company ratings, or no changes to ratings if Fitch's views the long-term debt  requirement assigned to BAC as providing an insufficient amount of bail-in  capital at the operating company level. KEY RATING DRIVERS & SENSITIVITIES - SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANY The IDRs and VRs of BAC's bank subsidiaries benefit from the cross-guarantee  mechanism in the U.S. under FIRREA and therefore IDRs and VRs of Bank of  America, N.A. are equalised across the group. Fitch regards BAC's investment  banking and broker-dealer entities such as Merrill Lynch International and Bank  of America Merrill Lynch International Ltd to be core entities for BAC and thus  IDRs equalized and linked to BAC.  Fitch views BAC's MBNA Limited subsidiary's ratings to be strategically  important for BAC and thus IDRs of this entity are one notch lower than BAC's  IDR in accordance with Fitch's rating criteria. As the IDRs and VRs of the subsidiaries are equalised with those of BAC to  reflect support from their ultimate parent, they are sensitive to changes in the  parent's propensity to provide support, which Fitch currently does not expect,  or from changes in BAC's IDRs.  To the extent that one of BAC's subsidiary or affiliated companies is not  considered to be a core business, Fitch could also notch the subsidiary's rating  from BAC's IDR. BAC is one of the largest U.S. banks in terms of total deposits, loans,  branches, mortgage originations/servicing and credit card issuance. Following  its January 2009 merger with Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc., BAC also became one of  the top financial institutions in wealth management and investment banking.

318,"   By Jonathan Stempel | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Dec 31 Ambac Assurance Corp sued Bank of America Corp to recoup hundreds of millions of dollars of losses from insuring roughly $1.68 billion of securities backed at least in part by risky mortgages from the bank's Countrywide Home Loans unit.In a complaint filed on Tuesday in a New York state court in Manhattan, Ambac accused Countrywide of lying about how well it underwrote so-called ""pay option adjustable-rate mortgage negative amortization"" loans that backed the securities.The securities were issued in eight transactions between 2005 and 2007, Ambac said.Ambac said it faced potential claims exceeding $600 million as of Oct. 31 and that pools of loans supporting its insured certificates had suffered $3.07 billion of losses by Nov. 30. It also said it would have never guaranteed payments had it known of Countrywide's deception. ""Countrywide's fraud is borne out by the transactions' dismal performance,"" Ambac said.Bank of America, the second-largest U.S. bank, bought Countrywide in July 2008. It did not immediately respond on Wednesday to requests for comment. Ambac Assurance is part of Ambac Financial Group Inc. The lawsuit shows how Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America might still face legal liability over shoddy mortgage practices predating the 2008 financial crisis, even after agreeing in August with federal and state authorities to pay a record $16.65 billion penalty to settle civil fraud charges.Chief Executive Brian Moynihan said at a Nov. 12 conference that the bank's major regulatory and litigation costs tied to the financial crisis, including the purchases of Countrywide and Merrill Lynch & Co, were ""largely behind us."" Ambac filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in November 2010 and emerged from bankruptcy 2-1/2 years later.On Dec. 23, the New York-based company said Co-Chairman Nader Tavakoli would become interim chief executive officer on Jan. 1.

The bank earned 32 cents per share, or 1 cent more than analysts expected, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, without the special items. Bond trading revenue also weighed on earnings, falling 30 percent to $1.46 billion due to a poor quarter in trading corporate and mortgage securities, two key areas for the bank.

328,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, January 15 (Fitch) Bank of America Corporation's (BAC) stated full tax  equivalent fourth quarter earnings of $3.05 billion were relatively clean,  according to Fitch Ratings. It was the first quarter in some time not to be  overly marred by sizable litigation charges. Nevertheless the company did incur  $400 million of litigation expense this quarter, though this is down  significantly from the other quarters this past year which included significant  charges in building up reserves for BAC's settlement with the Department of  Justice (DOJ) over mortgage related matters late last year. Fitch calculated pre-tax profits, which exclude CVA/DVA adjustments, this  quarter's FVA adjustment, and various other gains/losses amounted to $5.0  billion, or a 0.95% pre-tax adjusted return on ending assets (ROA). This is  BAC's best Fitch calculated pre-tax adjusted ROA performance in the last five  quarters, which Fitch attributes to a largely clean quarter as well as continued  expense reductions. Fitch continues to believe that with all of the legal settlements over the last  few years, the strength of BAC's suite of franchises should now become more  visible in the company's overall results absent any large and unforeseen legal  costs. That said, in order to improve earnings performance to at least peer  average levels, BAC will continue to have to work down overall expenses. To the  extent that management is successful at closing the earnings gap, there could be  some longer-term upside to current ratings. BAC's fully phased-in Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio under the  advanced approach remained relatively unchanged at 9.6%, as higher common equity  via retained earnings was offset by a higher proportion of operational risk  weighted assets (RWA), which now amounts to 34% of total RWA. BAC's fully  phased-in CET1 under the standardized approach increased to 10.0% as of year-end  2014.  BAC continues to have a highly liquid balance sheet largely driven by its  attractive and comparatively low cost consumer deposit base. Additionally, the  company continued to reduce its long-term debt footprint and improve its debt  maturity profile during the quarter. While most of BAC's businesses performed relatively well during the quarter, as  expected there was some weakness in Global Markets business given a both  sequential and year-over-year decline in its Fixed Income, Currency, and  Commodities (FICC) businesses. This decline is similar to other peer banks. BAC's asset quality metrics have continued to improve, thanks in part to some  loan sales during the quarter. Nonetheless, Fitch continues to believe that the  company's asset quality metrics are at or near a cyclical trough and there  should be some reversion in asset quality metrics for BAC, as well as the rest  of the industry, over a medium term time horizon. Additionally, BAC continued to make progress in reducing its overall expenses  during the quarter. This included continued reductions in costs associated with  its Legacy Asset & Servicing area, continued rationalization of the branch  network and overall staffing levels, and ongoing work related to streamlining  the company's operations. This resulted in an improvement in the fully taxable equivalent efficiency ratio  to 74.90% during the fourth quarter, which is good, but still well above peer  levels. To the extent that BAC can drive down its efficiency ratio (including  the impact from any unforeseen litigation costs) to the low 60's or high 50's  the earnings gap to peers would significantly improve.

334,"   By Denny Thomas and Engen Tham | HONG KONG/SHANGHAI  HONG KONG/SHANGHAI Lender BOC Hong Kong Holdings Ltd (2388.HK) is considering a sale of subsidiary Nanyang Commercial Bank (NCB) that could fetch about $6 billion, in a bid to stop cannibalising the China business of its parent, people familiar with the matter said.BOC Hong Kong is a unit of Bank of China Ltd (3988.HK), the fourth-biggest lender by assets in the mainland, and a sale of NCB will help streamline the group's operations in the country, the people said. As of June last year, half of NCB's total loans were to customers in China, according to ratings agency Moody's. An elimination of overlapping businesses could come as a boost for state-controlled Bank of China (601988.SS) which has seen a slowdown in profit growth and an increase in bad loans as China's economic growth weakens.           At $6 billion, any sale would be Asia Pacific's No. 3 bank deal of all time, according to Thomson Reuters data, behind Australia's Westpac Banking Corp's (WBC.AX) $17.9 billion purchase of St George Bank and Bank of America Corp's (BAC.N) $7 billion buying of a stake in China Construction Bank (601939.SS), both in 2008.One potential buyer interested in NCB is China Cinda Asset Management Co Ltd (1359.HK), the nation's No. 2 bad debt manager that listed in Hong Kong in December 2013, the people said.China Cinda has been keen to buy a bank, as unlike its biggest rival Huarong Asset Management, Cinda does not own a bank, one of the people said. Having a bank will help China Cinda to tap cheap sources of funds to buy soured loans. ""We don't comment on market speculation,"" a BOC Hong Kong spokeswoman said in an e-mailed statement. China Cinda did not reply to emails and phone calls seeking comment.The sources declined to be identified as the discussions were confidential.Nanyang has a book value of about $4 billion and bankers estimate any deal could be struck at about 1.5 times price to book, a measure usually used for valuing bank deals. That compares with 1.8 times price to book paid last year by Singapore's Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp (OCBC.SI) for Hong Kong' family-run Wing Hang Bank in a $4.9 billion deal. An NCB sale could also attract interest from other Chinese state-backed financial institutions and some private enterprises, the people said.""If you’re trying to build a financial empire you want to get as many licenses within your stable of companies as you can,"" said Matthew Smith, banking analyst at Macquarie Group. ""They'd be talking about synergies, using the bank's branch platform as a means of selling funds and insurance.""MOODY'S DOWNGRADE  BOC Hong Kong has discussed the potential NCB sale  internally but no final decision has been made, one person with direct knowledge of the matter said. A decision could come in the next few weeks, which may result in the launch of a formal sale process ""soon"", the person said.BOC Hong Kong's investment banking unit is expected to run the sale process, but another foreign bank is also likely to be hired to help with the process, the people added.Established  in 2001, BOC Hong Kong was formed by merging 10 of the 12 businesses of Bank of China group. Nanyang Commercial Bank has always operated as a separate entity given its China focus.A slowdown in the Chinese economy has impacted Nanyang's asset quality and triggered a ratings downgrade by Moody's in December, which cited its ""weaker risk profile as a result of growing mainland exposure"".

The now-defunct program was created before Bank of America bought Countrywide in July 2008.Rakoff rejected the defendants' contention that there was not enough evidence that they made any material misrepresentation to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, saying this argument ""borders on the frivolous.""Bank of America spokesman Lawrence Grayson declined to comment, but said the Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank will appeal the Oct. 2013 verdict. Marc Mukasey, a lawyer for Mairone, said in an email: ""We respectfully disagree with the court's ruling, and are quite optimistic about our chances on appeal.""Both penalties were imposed by Rakoff last July. Bank of America's payout is not covered by the second-largest U.S. bank's $16.65 billion mortgage settlement the following month with federal and state authorities. The Countrywide case was originally brought on the government's behalf by Edward O'Donnell, a former Countrywide executive who as a whistleblower would share in any recovery.O'Donnell received a $57 million whistleblower award for a second Countrywide case that was resolved as part of the $16.65 billion settlement, court documents show.The case is U.S. ex rel O'Donnell v.

340,"   By Peter Rudegeair and David Henry | NEW YORK  NEW YORK The rising value of the U.S. dollar could force big American banks, including Citigroup Inc, to hold more capital, reducing their profitability and attractiveness to stock investors, according to executives and an analyst.     Under a proposal that the U.S. Federal Reserve released in December to make the financial system safer, capital requirements would increase for banks as measurements of their size and complexity increase.     Measurements in the Fed's proposed rule are based largely on international standards which use euros to benchmark the size of banks. Because the value of the euro has depreciated versus the dollar, some U.S. banks now appear to be bigger in euros, which raises the rule's calculation of how much capital the banks must hold.    The euro declined around 12 percent against the U.S. dollar in 2014 and has dropped another 6 percent since the start of 2015, as anticipation built that the European Central Bank would embark on a policy of buying government bonds to stimulate growth. The 1 trillion euro ""quantitative easing"" plan was formally announced in late January. [ID:nL6N0V120L]       ""In some ways, the ECB's quantitative easing program probably added 50 basis points to every U.S. bank's"" capital requirements, Citigroup Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach said in a Jan 23 conference call with analysts. One basis point is equal to 0.01 percentage points.Goldman Sachs Group Inc Chief Financial Officer Harvey Schwartz said on a recent conference call that the investment bank was examining how currency moves under the Fed's proposal would affect its capital.    Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase & Co and Bank of America Corp would each have to increase their capital ratios by 0.50 percentage points under the Fed proposal, given the euro's dwindling valuation, Nomura bank analyst Steven Chubak said in a Monday research report.  That would reduce return on equity, a measure of bank profitability, next year from 12.1 percent to 11.6 percent at Citigroup, from 12.9 percent to 12.4 percent at JPMorgan and 12.0 percent to 11.4 percent at Bank of America.   Chubak estimated that the lower returns could reduce the value of the stocks of the three banks by about three percent.     Representatives from Citigroup, JPMorgan and Bank of America declined to comment. As a caveat on his estimates, Chubak noted that how much more capital the banks have to hold depends in part on how big they are compared with 75 global peers. Changes in those banks' local currencies against the euro would have to be factored into U.S. banks' needs.

341,"   By Sam Forgione | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Investors worldwide poured $21.5 billion into bond funds in the weekly reporting period ended Wednesday, before Friday's data showing U.S. job growth rose solidly in January, data from a Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global Research report showed on Friday. The inflows were the biggest since Sept. 2009, according to the report, which also cited data from fund-tracker EPFR Global. While the report said inflows were boosted by registered investment advisor reallocation, they also followed data showing U.S. gross domestic product slowed sharply in the fourth quarter.The view that the data might give the Fed more leeway to delay its first hike in benchmark borrowing costs from rock-bottom levels reassured bond investors. A rate hike is expected to hurt bond prices, which move inversely to yields.""Expectations for rate hikes in mid-year were pushed back to later in the year, or perhaps in some cases next year, which for many people means that's good for bonds,"" said Geoffrey Pazzanese, senior portfolio manager at Federated Investors in New York.  Stock funds, meanwhile, posted $6.8 billion in outflows, reversing inflows of $3.8 billion over the prior week. For their part, European stock funds worldwide attracted $4.3 billion of inflows, the fourth straight week of inflows, data from the BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research report added.  Pazzanese said the European Central Bank's bond-buying program is starting to benefit the earnings forecasts of European companies. ""It's starting to show up in terms of actual results for companies in the short run,"" he said.Investors showed some appetite for risk-taking in the latest week.

342,"   By Lauren Tara LaCapra | NEW YORK  NEW YORK A startup backed by Wall Street banks plans to create a digital marketplace for research and data products in a potentially ambitious foray into the financial technology and information businesses, people familiar with the matter said.The firm, called Symphony Communication Services Holdings LLC, is trying to solve a problem investors often complain about: too much information, some of which is irrelevant, coming from too many places.Instead of research reports, news and data coming from different touch points - email, the web, or proprietary systems like those offered by Thomson Reuters Corp and Bloomberg LP - they would instead flow into one central hub. Rather than an investor needing to sift through a barrage of reports, databases, and news items, the hub would seek to zone in on information about specific securities, markets or subjects of interest to them.The idea is in the early stages and does not yet have a name, people familiar with the matter said. It could be abandoned if information providers balk at collaborating with Symphony. It would be funded from the $66 million Symphony received in capital from a group of Wall Street banks led by Goldman Sachs Group Inc in October. On Jan. 5, Symphony rolled out its initial communications system that combines chat, email and social media accounts onto one platform. Senior Goldman executives, including Chief Information Officer R. Martin Chavez, are keenly interested in the new initiative, said the sources, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Symphony CEO David Gurle, who previously developed communications platforms at Microsoft Corp, Thomson Reuters and Skype, is leading the development effort.Spokeswomen for Symphony and Goldman Sachs declined to comment.Symphony's latest idea is not new: it echoes the business model of Thomson Reuters and Bloomberg, which dominate the financial news and data market. Other startups have tried to upend or improve upon that model before, with little success.""It's really hard to change habits,"" said Kevin McPartland, head of market structure and technology research at Greenwich Associates, a consulting firm to the financial industry.  Even if large banks like Goldman Sachs adopt the technology, they will still have to continue with older ways of distributing information to accommodate clients who have not yet switched.     And at least some customers will likely be suspicious of a product that comes from a group of banks, said Peter Appert, a senior equity research analyst with investment bank Piper Jaffray. ""You want the data and analytics coming from independent third parties,"" he said.    Information providers will also have to agree to plug their ""wires"" into the central system. Some data, research and news providers will see Symphony as a rival rather than a partner and will not want to engage in something that threatens to cannibalize their businesses, industry analysts and consultants said.But some Bloomberg and Thomson Reuters' banking and asset management clients, who declined to be named, say the two companies aren't adapting quickly enough to a broadening fire hose of information that clients care about. Bloomberg has been criticized for its ""closed architecture"" that does not allow customers to adapt Bloomberg technology to their specific needs, and for requiring customers to purchase a full package of services even if they only want to use small parts of it. Thomson Reuters has been more open to cutting specific deals with clients, but it still does not offer fully ""open architecture,"" the clients said.COLLABORATION IN QUESTION? Two people familiar with the matter said Thomson Reuters and News Corp's Dow Jones, which offers similar services, have informally expressed interest in partnering with Symphony, as have some smaller subscription services. Big dealers that have invested in Symphony are also likely to distribute research and data to paying clients through the platform. Bloomberg does not seem as interested and has not had direct communications with Symphony about collaborating, these people said. A Bloomberg spokesman declined to comment.Thomson Reuters spokesman Brian Mairs said the company is working with Symphony and is supportive of the principle of ""open messaging"" that is embodied in its own chat system, as well as Symphony's. ""We believe in open, cross-industry collaboration and we will be pleased to work with Symphony to develop the best solutions for our clients and the wider financial services industry,"" he said. He declined to comment on the company’s ability to adapt quickly to client demands or on any future threat that Symphony’s research and data plans may present for Thomson Reuters.A Dow Jones spokeswoman did not respond to requests for comment.Symphony says that its investors now using its system include: Goldman, Bank of America Corp, Bank of New York Mellon Corp, BlackRock Inc, Citadel, Citigroup Inc, Credit Suisse Group AG, Deutsche Bank AG, Jefferies Group LLC, JPMorgan Chase & Co, Maverick Capital Ltd, Morgan Stanley, Nomura Holdings Inc and Wells Fargo & Co. Another 2,000 companies have signed up to request access, people familiar with the matter said.

343,"  Deutsche Bank said it expects Citigroup Inc (C.N) to buy back $1 billion in shares every quarter and other U.S. banks to modestly boost dividends and share buybacks as part of their capital deployment plans under the Federal Reserve's stress test.Stress tests, part of the Fed's annual comprehensive capital analysis and review (CCAR), are designed to ensure that banks have enough capital cushions and are not being overly aggressive in returning cash to shareholders. The results of the latest round of tests are expected in March.The Fed has twice rejected Citigroup's plans to buy back shares and boost dividends in three years, saying the bank was not sufficiently prepared to handle a potential financial crisis. Deutsche Bank upgraded Citigroup's stock to ""buy"" from ""hold"", saying the sale or an initial public offering of the company's consumer finance unit could also be a ""near-term positive"". The unit, OneMain Financial Holdings Inc, filed for an IPO in October.The brokerage said it expected the biggest increases in combined dividend and buyback yields at Citigroup, Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), Regions Financial Corp (RF.N), Morgan Stanley (MS.N), SunTrust Banks Inc (STI.N) and Citizens Financial Group Inc (CFG.N). The brokerage predicts total payout ratios at the bigger regional banks to be 79 percent on average, compared with 69 percent last year.

344,"  (Repeats story moved on Monday with no changes)* Tesco shares rise as much as 1.9pct in weak overall market* Dhanin working with Bank of America, UBS and SCB* Tesco's Thai until valued between $7.2 bln-$9.9 blnBy Denny Thomas and Saeed AzharHONG KONG/SINGAPORE, Feb 9 Tesco Plc  rebuffed an approach from billionaire Dhanin Chearavanont in December to buy the British retailer's Thai unit, but undeterred, the tycoon is building financial firepower for another attempt, people familiar with the matter said.Thailand's second-richest man has added UBS and Siam Commercial Bank (SCB) to the list of banks to help finance and advise on a bid for Tesco Lotus after his preliminary talks to buy the business valued at about $10 billion ended without a deal, the people said. Bank of America Corp had assisted the tycoon in the earlier talks, they said.While it is not known why Tesco turned down Dhanin's approach, his sustained interest in the asset could be positive for Britain's biggest retailer, which is battling sluggish growth at home and has been hit by ratings downgrades and an accounting scandal. Tesco shares rose as much 1.9 percent after the Reuters report, bucking an 0.8 percent fall in the benchmark share index . The shares have risen 22.7 percent so far this year, recovering from a 43.5 percent slide in 2014.For Dhanin, 76, a potential Tesco Lotus purchase will significantly bolster control over the Thai retail market after he bought back Siam Makro pcl in 2013 for $6.6 billion in a highly levered-up deal valued at 53 times price-to-earnings ratio.Tesco and the Thai tycoon are not currently engaged in any talks, though Dhanin and his advisers are prepared to proceed with an offer if Tesco decides to sell the Thailand operations, the people added. The people declined to be identified because the discussions were confidential.Tesco declined to comment on Dhanin's approach. CEO Dave Lewis, who took charge in September, said last month while announcing an overhaul of Tesco's operations that he was ""committed to keeping all of the operations we have overseas, until we make any decisions otherwise"". TESCO'S DILEMMA Tesco's dilemma is whether to hold on to the growth market of Thailand or sacrifice that for cash. It has already scaled back in Asia and now operates in South Korea, Malaysia and India. ""The Tesco management has bought some time with the restructuring announced last month. But investors are closely monitoring the progress and the next earnings before stepping up pressure,"" one senior Hong Kong M&A banker, who is advising another buyer interested in Tesco's Asian assets.A spokesman for Charoen Pokphand Group (CP Group), Dhanin's flagship company, declined to comment. A Hong Kong-based Bank of America spokeswoman and spokesmen for UBS and Bangkok-based Siam Commercial also declined to comment.Dhanin, with a net worth of $11.5 billion as of June last year, is the chairman of CP Group, which was founded in 1921 and has businesses spanning retail, agro-industry, automotive and  financials among others. At the end of 2013, the group had $41 billion in revenue.Tesco bought a controlling stake in Dhanin's supermarket business Lotus in 1998 in the aftermath of the Asian financial crisis, paying 206 million pounds. That business now has more than 1,700 shops and represents nearly three-fourths of all of Tesco's Asia outlets.Morgan Stanley said in a report last week the Thai business is Tesco's most valuable international asset, valuing it between  4.7 billion pounds-6.5 billion pounds ($7.2 billion-$9.9 billion).If Tesco decides not to sell, Dhanin's options are limited as he wants to do a consensual deal, said a person with direct knowledge of the matter. ""Dhanin is not aggressive, that is not his style. He won't go hostile,"" said the person.($1 = 0.6556 pounds)   (Additional reporting by Neil Maidment and James Davey in LONDON and Khettiya Jittapong in BANGKOK and Shilpa Murthy in BANGALORE; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman and Louise Heavens)",2015-02-10,BAC,"Mon Feb 9, 2015 | 7:43pm EST",RPT-UPDATE 1-Tycoon Dhanin unfazed after Tesco rebuffs approach for Thai unit-sources,http://www.reuters.com//article/tesco-ma-cpgroup-idUSL4N0VK07M20150210?type=companyNews

The company's stock is up more than 16 percent year to date and reached an intraday record high of $129.45 per share. Last week, its stock market value rose above $700 billion, bigger than Switzerland's gross domestic product.Although Apple is the biggest position in Coatue Management's portfolio, the firm sold 1.7 million shares at the end of the quarter, or more than 15 percent of its stake, leaving it with 8.9 million shares, according to a regulatory filing on Tuesday.In a filing on Friday, Greenlight said it cut Apple holdings by 6.2 percent to 8.6 million shares during the quarter.Eric Mandelblatt's Soroban Capital Partners sold 4.3 million Apple call options, liquidating the fund's position.

Last week, its stock market value ballooned above $700 billion, bigger than Switzerland's gross domestic product.Although Apple is the biggest position in Coatue Management's portfolio, the firm sold 1.7 million shares at the end of the quarter, or 15 percent of its stake in the company, leaving it with 8.9 million shares, according to a regulatory filing on Tuesday.In a filing on Friday, Greenlight cut Apple holdings by 6.2 percent to 8.6 million shares during the quarter.Eric Mandelblatt's Soroban Capital Partners sold 4.3 million Apple call options, liquidating the fund's position. And David Tepper's Appaloosa Management hedge fund revealed that it had dissolved its stake in Apple.Last week, billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn said the technology company's shares should be trading at $216 apiece, equivalent to a market capitalization of about $1.26 trillion.The moves by Greenlight and Coatue were revealed in quarterly disclosures of manager stock holdings, known as 13F filings, with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. They are of great interest to investors trying to divine a pattern in what savvy traders are selling and buying.But relying on the filings to develop an investment strategy comes with some peril because the disclosures are backward-looking and come out 45 days after the end of each quarter.Still, the filings offer a glimpse into what hedge fund managers saw as opportunities to make money on the long side.The filings do not disclose short positions, or bets that a stock will fall in price. As a result, the public filings do not always present a complete picture of a management firm's stock holdings.The following are some of the hot stocks and sectors in which hedge fund managers either took new positions or exited existing positions in the fourth quarter.ACTAVIS Coatue Management opened a new position, buying 964,155 shares, as the pharmaceutical company Actavis Plc won the high-stakes battle to buy Botox maker Allergan Inc.Daniel Loeb's Third Point upped its stake by 20 percent to 3.5 million shares.

353,"   By Peter Rudegeair | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) cut Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan's pay by 7 percent in 2014, a source familiar with the matter said on Tuesday, as its full-year profit fell 58 percent on higher legal settlements. Moynihan's total 2014 compensation was $13 million, down from $14 million a year earlier, according to the source. He received $11.5 million in stock-based compensation, according to a regulatory filing on Tuesday, down from the $12.5 million he received for 2013.His base salary remained unchanged at $1.5 million, said the source, who was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter. As in 2013, Moynihan did not receive a cash bonus, according to the source.The filing did not explain why Moynihan's stock awards were lowered. The bank will submit a filing later this year containing Moynihan's total compensation.  Bank of America spent much of 2014 settling cases brought by U.S. regulators and law enforcement authorities. In two agreements over the course of the year, the second-largest U.S. bank said it would pay nearly $26 billion to settle claims that it sold investors faulty mortgage bonds. Those settlements led the bank to report a loss in two separate quarters in 2014. Overall profits in 2014 fell to $4.8 billion from $11.4 billion in 2013.  In contrast to Moynihan's smaller pay package, JPMorgan & Co (JPM.N) Chief Executive Jamie Dimon's total compensation in 2014 was $20 million, unchanged from a year prior.JPMorgan has had big settlement bills of its own, but those were mostly paid out in 2013.  The filing showed that Bank of America Chief Operating Officer Thomas Montag was awarded a $7.8 million stock-based compensation package for 2014, down from $8.7 million in 2013. Finance chief Bruce Thompson was awarded a $5.9 million stock-based compensation package for 2014, down from $6.7 million in 2013.

355,"   By Sam Forgione | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Investors worldwide poured $7.1 billion into bond funds in the week ended Feb. 18, with riskier high-yield bond funds attracting fresh inflows on signs global growth is improving, data from a Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global Research report showed on Friday.High-yield bond funds attracted $2.1 billion, marking their fourth straight week of inflows, according to the report, which also cited data from fund-tracker EPFR Global. Inflows of $6.4 billion into stock funds marked their second straight week of robust new demand and underscored investors' solid risk appetite.Exchange-traded funds, which are thought to represent the institutional investor, accounted for $5.8 billion of the stock fund inflows.While the inflows into high-yield bond funds were half the previous week's, which were the biggest since July 2013, they still showed investors' conviction that the bonds have more room to gain on the heels of a 1 percent drop in the Barclays U.S. Corporate High Yield index in the fourth quarter of 2014. The index has since rallied 2.2 percent so far this year. ""The underperformance in the fourth quarter has created an opportunity and, given a broadly positive global outlook, we would expect those bonds to do better,"" said John Bellows, portfolio manager at Western Asset Management Co. which oversees roughly $466 billion in assets.""An improving growth outlook, both in the United States and in Europe, combined with global accommodative monetary policy, that's a pretty favorable environment for risk assets,"" he added. Bellows said both lower-rated, high-yield bonds and investment-grade corporate bonds should gain in price. The latter group attracted $5 billion in new cash, their 61st straight week of inflows.A strong U.S. employment report for January released earlier this month and improving economic data out of Europe have cheered investors. On Friday, surveys showed the euro zone's private sector in February expanded at the fastest pace in seven months.Funds that hold European shares attracted the bulk of the new cash into equity funds in the latest week with $5.8 billion in inflows, marking their sixth straight week of new demand. Funds that hold U.S. stocks posted outflows of $1.2 billion, meanwhile, marking withdrawals in six of the past seven weeks, despite the benchmark S&P 500 stock index gaining 1.5 percent over the latest weekly period.Outflows of $11.2 billion from low-risk money market funds showed investors putting cash to work in riskier funds.

356,"   By Elizabeth Dilts | NEW YORK  NEW YORK For the last decade, Wall Street brokerages have had a pact not to sue brokers that leave their firms and try to take clients with them. Now Bank of America  Merrill Lynch, one of the founding signers of the truce, is taking steps to erode the agreement, industry lawyers say.The bank is making it harder for brokers to take some of their clients with them when they leave Merrill Lynch-specifically, clients that were referred to the broker by a Bank of America branch. Brokers in recent months have been asked to sign contracts saying that if they leave Merrill Lynch, they can't take the names or phone numbers of those customers with them, because those clients belong to the bank.Lawyers said this policy chips away at the decade-old truce among brokerages known as the Protocol for Broker Recruiting. The agreement was meant to end the continual and costly legal battles between brokerages and their brokers over who had the right to keep clients, and allows departing brokers to take client information including names and phone numbers with them.The original 2004 signers were Merrill Lynch, UBS AG  and Smith Barney, then part of Citigroup Inc,  and more than 1,200 brokerages have since signed onto the pact known among industry veterans as ""the protocol."" Bank of America acquired Merrill Lynch in 2009 in the wake of the financial crisis.""One of founders is trying to create exceptions to the protocol that are at odds with the stated goal laid out in the very first sentence: to further the clients' freedom of choice,""  said Joe Dougherty, a lawyer at Buchanan Ingersoll & Rooney who represented wealth management firm Stifel Nicolas & Company in protocol cases against Wells Fargo. ""It's at odds with the stated goals to begin to make exceptions based on referral leads.""Bank of America is not trying to do away with the protocol, said spokeswoman Susan McCabe.""We are strong supporters of the broker protocol, which offers important protections to advisers industry-wide,"" she said.She said the bank's policy is four years old, but more than 20 people familiar with the bank that Reuters contacted, including current brokers, outside lawyers, and recruiters, said that many brokers were asked to sign the contract for the first time in recent months.The bank appears to be ramping up the program to encourage retail bank branches to refer more customers to Merrill Lynch, brokers there said. The brokers said that clients referred from bank branches account for a negligible portion of their business. It isn't the first time that Bank of America has pushed back on the protocol. In 2011, the bank's U.S. Trust division began asking brokers that were moving to competitors to provide two months' notice, instead of two weeks' notice, and blocked them from reaching out to clients during that time.Bank of America's contract terms for Merrill Lynch brokers have not yet been tested in court, according to a Reuters review of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority's arbitration records, the arena where most protocol cases are handled.The bank's efforts to retain at least some of its customers underscores how uneasy the relationship between big banks and their retail brokerages can be. In recent decades the biggest banks have grown bigger to boost revenue by offering more products to more consumers. The financial crisis only accelerated that trend, allowing behemoths like Bank of America to buy faltering rivals like Merrill Lynch.But persuading retail bankers and brokers to refer business to one another is difficult-banks have struggled with ""cross selling"" products for years. Brokers that take customers from Bank of America retail branches must now decide whether they want to invest time and energy in clients that can provide revenue now, but will remain with the bank when the broker switches to a new firm. For some brokers, the bank's policy will be viewed as an incentive not to devote much energy in clients referred from branches, several brokers told Reuters.Others make the opposite argument: some brokers want to receive referrals because it makes their jobs easier, even if those clients remain the bank's property. ""You don't get something for nothing,"" said Rick Rummage, a broker recruiter in Herndon, Virginia.It is unclear if Bank of America's rule would hold up in arbitration, said Joe Dougherty, a lawyer at Buchanan Ingersoll & Rooney who represented wealth management firm Stifel Nicolas & Company in protocol cases against Wells Fargo. (Before the protocol, there were thousands of suits against departing brokers, but since the protocol has been put in place, that number has plunged to dozens.)At issue in this situation is that Merrill Lynch signed the protocol, but Bank of America hasn't, so it can claim that its clients are its property.""There is nothing in the protocol that says there is a carve-out for accounts referred to you from banking channels,"" said Patrick Burns, a Beverly Hills, California-based lawyer who has worked extensively with the agreement in representing brokers leaving their firms. ""I don't know how the general public or the hiring firms are supposed to just know that.""

357,"  (Adds details on probe)Feb 23 Goldman Sachs Group Inc said it could face a federal civil lawsuit after a government probe concluded that the bank had violated laws related to sale of residential mortgage-backed securities before the financial crisis.The bank said in a regulatory filing on Monday that it received a letter from the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of California in December in connection with the probe, and that it was cooperating with regulators.Goldman also raised the top end of its estimate of ""reasonably possible"" legal losses to about $3 billion from $2.5 billion. (bit.ly/1a4qBoU) The bank, however, said the loss estimate does not include any future claims stemming from U.S. government investigations into misconduct in the pooling and sale of residential mortgage-backed securities that contributed to the financial crisis.Last year, Citigroup Inc agreed to pay $7 billion to resolve claims it misled investors about shoddy mortgage-backed securities in the run-up to the financial crisis. JPMorgan Chase & Co also reached a $13 billion agreement with the regulator to settle similar government agency investigations, while Bank of America Corp settled mortgage probe with U.S. government for $16.65 billion. Goldman also said on Monday that its risk management and controls, trading activities and communications in connection with the establishment of benchmark rates, such as currency rates, were being investigated.In November, UK and U.S. regulators fined six banks, including JPMorgan and Citi, a total of $4.3 billion after a global investigation of their failure to stop traders from trying to manipulate the foreign exchange market.Goldman's shares were down less than 1 percent at $189.99 on the New York Stock Exchange in late-afternoon trading.

359,"   By Elizabeth Dilts | NEW YORK  NEW YORK For the last decade, Wall Street brokerages have had a pact not to sue brokers that leave their firms and try to take clients with them. Now Bank of America BAC.N Merrill Lynch, one of the founding signers of the truce, is taking steps to erode the agreement, industry lawyers say.The bank is making it harder for brokers to take some of their clients with them when they leave Merrill Lynch—specifically, clients that were referred to the broker by a Bank of America branch. Brokers in recent months have been asked to sign contracts saying that if they leave Merrill Lynch, they can't take the names or phone numbers of those customers with them, because those clients belong to the bank.Lawyers said this policy chips away at the decade-old truce among brokerages known as the Protocol for Broker Recruiting. The agreement was meant to end the continual and costly legal battles between brokerages and their brokers over who had the right to keep clients, and allows departing brokers to take client information including names and phone numbers with them.The original 2004 signers were Merrill Lynch, UBS AG UBSG.VX and Smith Barney, then part of Citigroup Inc, C.N and more than 1,200 brokerages have since signed onto the pact known among industry veterans as ""the protocol."" Bank of America acquired Merrill Lynch in 2009 in the wake of the financial crisis.""One of founders is trying to create exceptions to the protocol that are at odds with the stated goal laid out in the very first sentence: to further the clients' freedom of choice,"" said Joe Dougherty, a lawyer at Buchanan Ingersoll & Rooney who represented wealth management firm Stifel Nicolas & Company in protocol cases against Wells Fargo. ""It's at odds with the stated goals to begin to make exceptions based on referral leads.""Bank of America is not trying to do away with the protocol, said spokeswoman Susan McCabe.""We are strong supporters of the broker protocol, which offers important protections to advisers industry-wide,"" she said.She said the bank's policy is four years old, but more than 20 people familiar with the bank that Reuters contacted, including current brokers, outside lawyers, and recruiters, said that many brokers were asked to sign the contract for the first time in recent months.The bank appears to be ramping up the program to encourage retail bank branches to refer more customers to Merrill Lynch, brokers there said. The brokers said that clients referred from bank branches account for a negligible portion of their business.It isn't the first time that Bank of America has pushed back on the protocol. In 2011, the bank's U.S. Trust division began asking brokers that were moving to competitors to provide two months' notice, instead of two weeks' notice, and blocked them from reaching out to clients during that time. Bank of America's contract terms for Merrill Lynch brokers have not yet been tested in court, according to a Reuters review of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority's arbitration records, the arena where most protocol cases are handled.The bank's efforts to retain at least some of its customers underscores how uneasy the relationship between big banks and their retail brokerages can be. In recent decades the biggest banks have grown bigger to boost revenue by offering more products to more consumers. The financial crisis only accelerated that trend, allowing behemoths like Bank of America to buy faltering rivals like Merrill Lynch.But persuading retail bankers and brokers to refer business to one another is difficult—banks have struggled with ""cross selling"" products for years. Brokers that take customers from Bank of America retail branches must now decide whether they want to invest time and energy in clients that can provide revenue now, but will remain with the bank when the broker switches to a new firm. For some brokers, the bank's policy will be viewed as an incentive not to devote much energy in clients referred from branches, several brokers told Reuters.Others make the opposite argument: some brokers want to receive referrals because it makes their jobs easier, even if those clients remain the bank's property.""You don't get something for nothing,"" said Rick Rummage, a broker recruiter in Herndon, Virginia. It is unclear if Bank of America's rule would hold up in arbitration, said Joe Dougherty, a lawyer at Buchanan Ingersoll & Rooney who represented wealth management firm Stifel Nicolas & Company in protocol cases against Wells Fargo. (Before the protocol, there were thousands of suits against departing brokers, but since the protocol has been put in place, that number has plunged to dozens.)At issue in this situation is that Merrill Lynch signed the protocol, but Bank of America hasn't, so it can claim that its clients are its property.""There is nothing in the protocol that says there is a carve-out for accounts referred to you from banking channels,"" said Patrick Burns, a Beverly Hills, California-based lawyer who has worked extensively with the agreement in representing brokers leaving their firms. ""I don’t know how the general public or the hiring firms are supposed to just know that.""RACE TO THE COURTHOUSE  Bank of America branches are now asked to send one client a month to Merrill Lynch or U.S. Trust brokers. As of October, the bank made about 20,000 referrals to Merrill Lynch, according to Aron Levine, head of Preferred Banking and Merrill Edge.Levine oversees roughly 1,000 brokers at Bank of America branches, who tend to deal with clients with smaller amounts of money to invest. Once a customer has about $250,000 to invest, branch brokers refer them to Merrill Lynch.While Wall Street brokerages are notoriously secretive about their policies, Reuters found no evidence that Bank of America's competitors have similar contract provisions in place.Wells Fargo & Co.

376,"   By Karen Freifeld and Jonathan Stempel | NEW YORK  NEW YORK A New York state appeals court on Thursday approved Bank of America Corp's $8.5 billion settlement with mortgage securities investors in its entirety.The decision by the Appellate Division in Manhattan likely resolved one of the second-largest U.S. bank's last and largest legal liabilities related to the financial crisis.Bank of America had agreed to the 2011 settlement with 22 institutional investors including BlackRock Inc, MetLife Inc and Allianz SE's Pacific Investment Management Co to resolve claims over $174 billion of mortgage securities issued by the former Countrywide Financial Corp.Many of these securities went into default after Bank of America bought Countrywide in 2008, leading to huge losses.But some investors claimed the settlement shortchanged them. They said Bank of New York Mellon Corp, which negotiated the accord as trustee for 530 trusts involved in the case, did not work hard enough to recover more money. In Thursday's decision, Justice David Saxe wrote for a five-judge panel that Bank of New York Mellon did not abuse its discretion in arranging the settlement.The court also said Barbara Kapnick, a state judge who  approved most of the accord in January 2014, erred in excluding claims by investors regarding loan modifications on the ground that the trustee didn't properly investigate their strength.Saxe said Kapnick imposed too tough a standard on Bank of New York Mellon, ""one that allows a court to micromanage and second guess the reasoned, and reasonable, decisions of a trustee. ""We therefore find that the trustee did not abuse its discretion in deciding to release the claims based on the failure to repurchase the modified mortgages, and we approve the settlement in its entirety,"" Saxe wrote.The Retirement Board of the Policemen's Annuity and Benefit Fund of the City of Chicago led the appeal on behalf of objecting investors.American International Group Inc had previously objected to the accord, but the insurer settled with Bank of America last July. A lawyer for the objecting investors did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Bank of America spokesman Lawrence Grayson declined to comment. Bank of New York Mellon was not immediately available for comment.The $8.5 billion accord is separate from Bank of America's $16.65 billion mortgage settlement last August with federal and state authorities.The case is In re: Bank of New York Mellon et al, New York State Appellate Division, 1st Department, No. 13527.

Negotiations between CBRE and Johnson Controls are ongoing and a deal is not certain, they added.The sources asked not to be identified because the talks are confidential.

Lynch | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Bank of America (BAC.N) must allow shareholders to vote on a proposal that calls for the company to consider spinning off its investment banking business, after U.S. regulators told the bank it cannot exclude the proposal from its corporate ballot.The March 17 decision by the Securities and Exchange Commission, seen by Reuters Wednesday, marks a victory for Bartlett Naylor, a Bank of America shareholder who works for the non-profit Public Citizen.It also represents a reversal for the SEC, which last year rejected nearly identical resolutions filed by Naylor at Bank of America, as well as JP Morgan Chase (JPM.N) and Citigroup (C.N). It also has rejected similar plans by other groups in the past.Bank spokesman Lawrence Grayson said the bank ""will respond to the proposal in our proxy statement. We do not believe that creating a separate subcommittee on shareholder value is necessary.""He said the board ""focuses on shareholder value and regularly analyzes these issues. We have reduced the size of the company by hundreds of billions of dollars as we have streamlined and simplified our business model.""

387,"   By Jonathan Stempel  A federal judge rejected Bank of America Corp's request to dismiss a lawsuit in which Cook County, Illinois, accused the lender of targeting black and Hispanic borrowers in the Chicago area with subprime mortgages.In a decision dated Thursday, U.S. District Judge Elaine Bucklo in Chicago said Cook County could pursue allegations that the bank steered minority borrowers into an outsized number of high-cost home loans, resulting in more foreclosures, lower property taxes and greater urban blight.""The county has asserted an adequate injury-in-fact that is plausibly connected to defendants' alleged discriminatory lending,"" Bucklo wrote. She did not rule on the case's merits.Cook County, the nation's second most populous county after Los Angeles, had accused Bank of America of ""reverse redlining,"" in which credit is often extended on unfair terms in specific geographic areas based on borrowers' race, ethnicity or income. The county said Bank of America made about 95,000 home loans to minority borrowers on less favorable terms than loans to similar white borrowers, and that about 60 percent of the loans in question were or could prove at risk of default.Bank of America in a statement said, ""The factual and legal issues in this case will be very complex,"" adding that its record ""demonstrates a firm commitment and strong record for fair and responsible lending and community revitalization."" The Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank sought to dismiss the case on the grounds that Cook County lacked standing, waited too long to sue, and did not show violations of the federal Fair Housing Act.Bucklo noted that the U.S. Supreme Court is expected to decide by June whether to narrow the scope of discrimination claims made under that law, and that its decision could affect Cook County's case. Cook County's lawsuit is one of many in which municipalities such as Los Angeles, Baltimore, Cleveland and Providence, Rhode Island, have sought to hold mortgage lenders responsible for mounting foreclosures. Cook County last March also brought one such case against HSBC Holdings Plc.The case is County of Cook v.

But both also said they would support Bank of America directors this year after the bank separately adopted a rule change to make it easier for shareholders to nominate directors.""Our principles still state that we think the CEO and chair positions should be held by different people,"" said Aeisha Mastagni, a CalSTRS investment officer.A Bank of America representative declined to comment.  In its proxy statement, the bank wrote its board understands ""the 2009 stockholder support for separating the roles of the chairman and CEO to have been due primarily to dissatisfaction with the then board's governance and oversight, the company's performance and management decisions at that time.""While it recognizes some shareholders still would prefer the roles be separated, Bank of America has since made changes to its governance, the proxy states, including adding eight new directors in the last three years to its 15-member board.

CalSTRS officials and a spokesman for another critic, New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer, said they would continue to press the bank over the combined CEO and chair roles.But both also said they would support Bank of America directors this year after the bank separately adopted a rule change to make it easier for shareholders to nominate directors.

407,"  New York's attorney general has sent letters to 13 national retailers, including Gap Inc, Target Corp and JC Penney Co Inc, about ""on-call shifts"" in which workers are told whether to report to work a day or less before a scheduled shift.Attorney General Eric Schneiderman's letters, sent on Friday, say on-call systems leave ""too little time to make arrangements for family needs, let alone to find an alternative source of income to compensate for the lost pay"" on days the employees are not called in to work.A number of companies with stores in New York are requiring employees to check in by telephone, text message or email before a planned shift to see if their services are needed, Schneiderman wrote in the letters.The system allows retailers to adjust staffing based on store traffic forecasts made by scheduling software. The companies can then reduce over-staffing and under-staffing.His requests come as workers' advocates claim success in efforts to increase pay and benefits at fast food companies and national retailers, including recent raises of minimum wages by McDonald's Corp and Wal Mart Stores Inc.Schneiderman said the ""on-call"" practice might violate the law in New York, where employers are subject to a rule that says employees who report for a scheduled shift on any day have to be paid for at least four hours at the basic minimum hourly wage.Target said workers are informed of their schedules 10 days before the start of a work week and it does not employ ""on-call"" shifts. JC Penney said it has a policy against on-call scheduling. The Gap said it is committed to ""sustainable scheduling practices"" and is conducting research on the matter.Worker advocates say unpredictable scheduling is one of the key challenges facing low-wage workers.  ""One of reasons it is coming to light now is that people are organizing around it,"" said Tsedeye Gebreselassie, senior attorney at the National Employment Law Project.He noted that a 2011 union-backed study of New York retail workers showed a fifth surveyed were required to always or frequently be available for on-call shifts. Bills addressing on-call scheduling are currently being considered in the state legislatures of Massachusetts, Connecticut, Minnesota, Oregon and California, according to the Center for Popular Democracy, a worker advocacy group. The U.S. Labor Department said it is aware of the on-call scheduling concerns and is looking into the matter.""This is an important issue for workers struggling with work-life balance, especially for women,"" spokeswoman Tania Mejia said.Schneiderman asked the retailers to provide details on the processes they follow to schedule on-call shifts, such as whether they use computerized systems and penalize employees who do not follow on-call procedures.He also asked the companies for any analysis they might have conducted on cost savings associated with on-call shifts and the impact on workers' wellbeing. The companies have until May 4 to send in their responses. The Gap said it was engaged in a research project with the UC Hastings College of Worklife Law to examine scheduling and productivity, and expects to receive some data in the fall of 2015.""In the meantime, each of our brands also has been working to evaluate and refine their practices to make improvements,"" a spokeswoman for the retailer said.Letters were also sent to Abercrombie & Fitch Co, J. Crew, L Brands Inc, Burlington Coat Factory, TJX Cos Inc, Urban Outfitters Inc, Crocs Inc, Ann Inc, Sears Holdings Corp and Williams-Sonoma Inc.Sears and Ann Inc both said they do not use on-call scheduling.

408,"   By Olivia Oran and Nadia Damouni | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Several high-ranking bankers have left their jobs at major investment banks in the last 13 months amid a surge in U.S. healthcare deal activity to seek better compensation at boutique investment banks as well as to participate in the growth of the industry at biotech companies themselves. JPMorgan Chase & Co and Bank of America have both lost senior healthcare investment bankers to boutique investment bank Guggenheim Partners, showing that banks face challenges in being able to pay competitive rates. The biggest U.S. banks are under pressure from regulators to preserve more capital, rather than use M&A fees to pay higher bonuses.""The volume of transactions across healthcare is extreme and so the banker merry-go-round begins,"" said Paul Heller, the leader of executive recruiting firm Caldwell Partners' financial services practice. There's been $92.5 billion worth of U.S. healthcare merger activity so far this year, 73 percent more than in the same period last year, driven by 242 deals. Healthcare has been the busiest sector for deals so far this year, fueled by transactions such as Pfizer Inc's (PFE.N) $17 billion offer for Hospira Inc HSP.N and Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Ltd's (VRX.TO) $11 billion acquisition of Salix Pharmaceuticals Ltd.U.S. healthcare investment banking fees, meanwhile, have topped $1.9 billion since January, up more than 37 percent from the same period last year. Average annual pay for a healthcare investment banking managing director – the most typical role for a senior banker -- is roughly $1.5 million to $2 million, according to recruiters and bankers, and hasn’t budged much in recent years despite the rise in M&A activity. Wall Street compensation rose about 4 percent on average last year, according to financial industry recruiting firm Options Group. Some large banks are hoping to stem the flow of banker departures by offering one-year pay guarantees for top performers, according to industry bankers.      Guggenheim Partners said in March that Joseph Kohls, a former Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) global healthcare co-head and Jeffrey Hoffman, JPMorgan Chase & Co's (JPM.N) former West Coast healthcare head, would be joining the firm. Kohls helped advise medical device company Biomet Inc on its $13.4 billion acquisition by Zimmer Holdings Inc ZMH.N last year, and Hoffman led a team that advised AbbVie Inc (ABBV.N) on its $55 billion deal for British pharmaceutical company Shire, which it ended up abandoning.     Bankers can often negotiate a 30 to 50 percent pay raise for their first-year compensation at a new bank if they jump ship, according to recruiters and bankers. Free from many of Wall Street's regulations, a boutique investment bank can also offer bankers hefty commissions on individual deals. Some boutique banks are luring rainmakers with the promise of taking home a large percentage of the fees they generate, bankers and recruiters said, a practice rarely seen at the bigger banks. Boutiques can also offer their bankers compensation in cash, while a large portion of pay at larger banks remains tied up in stock.  Neither Kohls nor Hoffman responded to requests for comment. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) banker Lorence Kim left in March 2014 to take a job with life science company Moderna, while his Goldman colleague David Woodhouse joined NGM Biopharmaceuticals in March of this year. Morgan Stanley's (MS.N) Steve Harr took an executive position at Juno Therapeutics in March 2014. Former Credit Suisse investment banker Mark Page joined biotech Macrocure Ltd (MCUR.O) in February as chief financial officer.""My whole banking career was to help set me up for an opportunity like this,"" Page said.Kim, Woodhouse and Harr all declined to respond to requests for comment.These bankers may benefit by taking executive roles at biotech companies and receiving stock as part of their compensation, in a bet that the share price will go up. The Nasdaq Biotechnology index has risen 66 percent in the last 12 months.""The potential equity upside on the corporate side is as attractive today than it ever has been compared to Wall Street compensation,"" said Burke St. John, vice chairman and head of the global financial services practice at executive search firm CTPartners. ""It might take you two or three times as long on a more traditional Wall Street career path to earn what you could make working for the right client.""

Some large banks are hoping to stem the flow of banker departures by offering one-year pay guarantees for top performers, according to industry bankers.Guggenheim Partners said in March that Joseph Kohls, a former Bank of America Corp global healthcare co-head and Jeffrey Hoffman, JPMorgan Chase & Co's former West Coast healthcare head, would be joining the firm.Kohls helped advise medical device company Biomet Inc on its $13.4 billion acquisition by Zimmer Holdings Inc last year, and Hoffman led a team that advised AbbVie Inc on its $55 billion deal for British pharmaceutical company Shire, which it ended up abandoning.Bankers can often negotiate a 30 to 50 percent pay raise for their first-year compensation at a new bank if they jump ship, according to recruiters and bankers. Free from many of Wall Street's regulations, a boutique investment bank can also offer bankers hefty commissions on individual deals. Some boutique banks are luring rainmakers with the promise of taking home a large percentage of the fees they generate, bankers and recruiters said, a practice rarely seen at the bigger banks.Boutiques can also offer their bankers compensation in cash, while a large portion of pay at larger banks remains tied up in stock.Neither Kohls nor Hoffman responded to requests for comment. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs Group Inc banker Lorence Kim left in March 2014 to take a job with life science company Moderna, while his Goldman colleague David Woodhouse joined NGM Biopharmaceuticals in March of this year. Morgan Stanley's  Steve Harr took an executive position at Juno Therapeutics in March 2014.Former Credit Suisse investment banker Mark Page joined biotech Macrocure Ltd in February as chief financial officer.""My whole banking career was to help set me up for an opportunity like this,"" Page said.Kim, Woodhouse and Harr all declined to respond to requests for comment.These bankers may benefit by taking executive roles at biotech companies and receiving stock as part of their compensation, in a bet that the share price will go up. The Nasdaq Biotechnology index has risen 66 percent in the last 12 months.""The potential equity upside on the corporate side is as attractive today than it ever has been compared to Wall Street compensation,"" said Burke St. John, vice chairman and head of the global financial services practice at executive search firm CTPartners. ""It might take you two or three times as long on a more traditional Wall Street career path to earn what you could make working for the right client.""

410,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, April 15 (Fitch) Bank of America Corporation's (BAC) reported first  quarter 2015 (1Q'15) earnings of $3.36 billion were improved, according to Fitch  Ratings. The company's earnings improved relative to both the sequential  quarter, which is typically seasonally slower, and the prior year quarter, which  was marred by significant litigation charges.   Fitch calculated pre-tax profits, which excluded DVA/FVA adjustments and various  other gains/losses, amounted to a fully taxable equivalent amount of $4.8  billion, or a 0.89% adjusted pre-tax return on ending assets.  Fitch views this  result favorably, and notes that it is some evidence of the strength of BAC's  suite of franchises as well as management's efforts to reduce costs and  streamline BAC's operations.  Fitch would expect further earnings improvements  over time, and notes that this may lead to some upward momentum in BAC's ratings  over time. BAC's total revenue of $21.2 billion was up relative to the sequential quarter,  but down relative to the year-ago quarter.  Revenue per business line was  generally stable to modestly down.  However, there was a strong improvement in  BAC's mortgage banking income in the Consumer Banking segment. BAC's Global Banking business net income was down sequentially but up relative  to the year-ago quarter.  Lower net interest income (NII) in this segment as  well as lower investment banking fees were offset by lower provision expense and  lower non-interest expenses both compared to the year-ago quarter.  Loan growth  in this segment improved modestly, with average loans up slightly versus the  year-ago quarter.  Fitch would expect additional loan growth to help drive  results in this segment over time. BAC's Global Markets business net income was seasonally up relative to the  sequential quarter which was also marred by charges, but was down relative to  the year-ago quarter.  The year-over-year decline was due to lower revenue from  Fixed Income Currency & Commodities (FICC) as well as lower revenue from credit  and mortgage products, which was partially offset by higher foreign exchange  (FX) and rates trading revenue due to higher market volatility.  However, since  BAC's macro (FX and rates) platform is not as large as other market  participants, it could not fully offset the decline in FICC.  BAC's equities  revenue was relatively stable. Expense reductions remain a high priority for BAC.  Relative to the year-ago  quarter, BAC's expenses were down even excluding the large litigation charge  recorded in 1Q'14.  This was due in part to continued headcount optimization in  the core businesses as well as the Legacy Asset Servicing (LAS) segment as well  as continued branch network rationalization.  Fitch expects management to  continue to pull these levers, among others, to streamline the company's  operations, and notes this to be a key factor in helping to improve BAC's  earnings power. Asset quality metrics for BAC, as well as the rest of the industry, continue to  improve and Fitch believes them to be at or near a cyclical trough.  Fitch would  expect some reversion in asset quality metrics over a medium-term time horizon. In addition, BAC's capital and liquidity metrics both improved during the  quarter, which Fitch views positively from a credit perspective.   The company's fully phased-in Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio under  the standardized approach increased due 10.3% in 1Q'15 up from 10% in 4Q'14 due  to improved earnings, a lower deferred tax asset deduction, and a benefit from  accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) amid the rally in rates during the  quarter. BAC's fully phased-in Basel III CET1 ratio under the advanced approaches was  10.1% in 1Q'15, though BAC has indicated that it may have to modify some of its  credit models in order to gain approval to exit parallel run from regulators,  which it estimates could reduce this ratio by approximately 100 basis points. In addition, BAC is in compliance with the Enhanced Supplementary Leverage Ratio  (SLR), which was 6.3% at the holding company and 7.1% at the primary bank  subsidiary as of 1Q'15.

419,"  (Adds quotes, comments, background)By Karen Freifeld and Suzanne BarlynApril 21 New York's banking regulator will not settle with Barclays Plc over foreign exchange trading in coming weeks unless the deal excludes a probe of the possible rigging of rates through computer programs, the agency's superintendent said on Tuesday.""There are two options: You can do a settlement in May with a carveout, or you can do a settlement later without a carveout,"" Benjamin Lawsky, superintendent of New York's Department of Financial Services, said after a Dow Jones event in midtown Manhattan.Barclays is among a handful of banks expected to come to terms in the coming weeks with the U.S. Department of Justice and other authorities over manipulation of foreign exchange rates.Barclays is the only bank in the group that is licensed and regulated by New York state. The other banks likely to settle are JPMorgan Chase & Co, Citigroup Inc, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc and UBS Group AG. Lawsky said on Tuesday it would probably take several months for the agency to complete its probe of whether Barclays  has used computerized programs to manipulate foreign exchange rates.Investigators have been trying to determine whether such programs allow banks to take advantage of clients when pricing currency transactions.In November, regulators fined HSBC Holdings Plc, JPMorgan, Citigroup, RBS, UBS and Bank of America Corp  a combined $4.3 billion for failing to stop traders from trying to rig the foreign exchange market. Barclays did not join that settlement because of issues with the New York regulator, people familiar with the matter told Reuters at the time.It is unclear how Lawsky's decision will affect any upcoming deals involving Barclays. ""That's going to be up to Barclays and up to the other regulators,"" Lawsky said.Barclays spokeswoman Kerrie Cohen declined to comment, as did Justice Department spokesman Peter Carr.Authorities probing the foreign exchange market have generally focused on suspected collusion between certain employees over the rates, as shown in transcripts of traders in online chat rooms that led to the November settlements.New York installed monitors at Barclays and Deutsche Bank  to assist with probes of foreign exchange algorithms.Other banks under scrutiny by the state over their forex systems include Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Credit Suisse Group AG, BNP Paribas SA and Societe Generale, sources have told Reuters.

424,"   By Lawrence Hurley | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON On March 6, the day of the U.S. Supreme Court's deadline for legal briefs backing same-sex marriage, gay rights activists quietly celebrated a victory on Wall Street.Twenty-eight of the country's biggest financial firms had made an unprecedented show of unity in support of gay marriage by urging the court to strike down state laws banning same-sex unions.That was double the number that signed on to a similar effort in 2013, signaling how the traditionally conservative financial industry has come to publicly embrace gay rights. Then, the Supreme Court struck down a federal law that denied benefits to same-sex couples.""Together, we pushed Wall Street to a place our industry has never gone before,"" Daniel Maury, a managing director at UBS Group AG, wrote in a celebratory email to his fellow members of Open Finance, a group of gay and lesbian Wall Street employees that lobbied hard for banks' signatures.The 28 included major U.S. investment and retail banks, the ""big four"" accounting firms and financial information firms Thomson Reuters Corp, which owns Reuters, and Bloomberg LLP.Wall Street's evolution on gay rights mirrors a broader shift on the issue in corporate America and society. But in some ways it has been a more difficult transition for a financial industry known for a macho culture famously portrayed in the 1987 movie ""Wall Street"" and where homophobic sentiment has in the past been widespread.Peter Staley, who worked at J.P. Morgan in the 1980s before becoming a high-profile HIV/AIDS activist, recalled constant homophobic comments when he was a bond trader.""For a closeted gay man, it was probably the worst environment I could have chosen,"" he said. ""It was very infuriating and humiliating for someone who had a dark secret like I had.""Wall Street has become a far less hostile environment for gay and lesbian employees, most workers say.In the brief, banks and other companies said they face additional costs and administrative headaches due to the patchwork of state marriage laws that help determine how benefits are administered and taxes calculated.Wall Street also has particular cause to embrace gay rights as part of its sharp competition for top young talent with more openly liberal Silicon Valley firms, several banking sources said. Support from high-profile bankers, such as Goldman Sachs Group Inc CEO Lloyd Blankfein, has helped accelerate the change in attitudes.""It's fair to say it's kind of a night and day difference"" when compared with tales of the trading floor from decades past, said Mark Lane, director of media relations at Barclays Plc in New York and head of a gay and lesbian employee group.James Gorman, CEO of Morgan Stanley, said the problem had not entirely gone away, particularly in the traditionally boisterous atmosphere of trading floors.""It is there in subtle ways and probably in unsubtle ways, for example, on trading floors I'm sure,"" Gorman said at a summit this week organized by Out on the Street, a gay and lesbian networking group that focuses on senior executives.Morgan Stanley, Barclays and Goldman Sachs all signed the brief.A number of banks, including Barclays, have rolled out so-called ""straight ally"" programs over the past five years in which employees act as supporters of gay and lesbian colleagues. Participants generally post a sign on their desks identifying them as allies so gay and lesbian workers can easily spot them. NOT ALL BANKS SIGNED In a ruling due by the end of June, the Supreme Court will decide whether states can ever restrict marriage to heterosexual couples.

Maury and others involved in the campaign said the main obstacle to winning the banks' support was bureaucratic rather than any opposition to gay marriage.The effort in 2013 to sign Wall Street firms up to that year's brief was an ad hoc move led by Maury. This time there were weekly meetings and a spreadsheet that showed the status of each firm.Their challenge was to get approval from different departments, including legal and public affairs, before chief executives made the final decision by the March 6 deadline.Gay marriage opponents, who lack any support from the business community in briefs filed at the Supreme Court, say well-funded activists have intimidated companies into supporting their cause.Nine Wall Street companies that are members of Open Finance did not sign the brief.

443,"  (Updates to add US dollar conversions in the headline and first paragraph)By Greg Roumeliotis and Mike StoneMay 5 Mexican conglomerate Alfa Sab de CV  and Harbour Energy Ltd have agreed to acquire Canadian oil and gas company Pacific Rubiales Energy Corp  for C$6 billion ($4.97 billion), including debt, a person familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.Pacific Rubiales is the largest independent oil and gas producer in Latin America. Its shares have plummeted more than 80 percent since oil prices began to slide last summer.Alfa, which already owns a 20 percent stake in the company, decided now was the time to act, and on vastly improved terms than when it paid C$21 per share last August in a C$189.4 million transaction to raise its stake in the company to 17 percent. Toronto-listed Pacific Rubiales, whose shares also trade in Colombia, suspended trade in its Bogota shares on Tuesday afternoon after the deal was made public.Alfa and Harbour have agreed to pay around C$6 ($5) per share for Pacific Rubiales and will each own half of the company, that source said, asking not to be identified because the deal is not yet public. Pacific Rubiales ended trading on Tuesday at C$4.83.Harbour Energy is a joint venture between Asian commodity trader Noble Group Ltd and U.S. private-equity firm EIG Global Energy Partners. Alfa believes the investment, by boosting its oil and gas footprint, will position it to participate more strongly in Mexico's energy liberalization, the person added.Representatives for the companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Toronto-Based Pacific Rubiales produces natural gas and crude oil at 90 exploration and production blocks in seven countries; Colombia, Peru, Guatemala, Brazil, Guyana, Papua New Guinea and Belize.The company is the second-biggest oil producer in Colombia with output of about 145,000 barrels per day. However, it is set to lose about 65,000 barrels per day of that in mid-2016 when its contract to operate state-run Ecopetrol's Rubiales field expires.Alfa, headquartered near Monterrey, Mexico, has businesses in oil and gas, branded foods, aluminum auto components,  petrochemicals, information technology and telecommunications services. It has a market capitalization of 164.7 billion Mexican pesos ($10.6 billion).Bank of America Corp advised Pacific Rubiales on the deal.

444,"   By David Henry and Ross Kerber | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Four Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) directors on the board's governance committee received unusually small majorities of votes for re-election at this week's annual meeting, according to tallies the company released on Thursday.None received more than 71.9 percent of the votes cast, compared with each last year receiving at least 98 percent.Shareholder advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services had recommended voting against the four directors after their committee advised the board in October to unilaterally change company bylaws to allow Chief Executive Brian Moynihan to also be named chairman.The relatively low votes for the four directors contrasted with strong shows of support for other directors and for the board's positions on other issues at the meeting. Moynihan was re-elected with 93.9 percent and 95.9 percent of voters sided with the board in opposing a call for a study of breaking up the bank, the second biggest U.S.-based lender.

On Monday the company promised to hold another shareholder vote on the issue no later than next year's meeting.The board's action in October was seen by insiders then as evidence that Moynihan had won more influence with directors.Thomas May, the head of the governance committee, received 66.7 percent of votes cast. Advisory firm Glass Lewis & Co had recommended that May alone not be re-elected to the board because of bylaw change. The three other committee members, Sharon Allen, Frank Bramble and Lionel Nowell received, respectively, 71.9, 71.7 and 71.8 percent of votes. Similar shareholder dissatisfaction has led to changes on boards of other banks.

446,"   By Liana B. Baker  May 11 Barclays Plc has hired Mark Garcia, a semiconductor specialist from Bank of America, in a move to help build out its team in one of the most active sectors of technology banking.Garcia, a managing director, starts Monday in Barclays' Menlo Park, California office. He was at Bank of America for nine years.The source did not want to speak on the record because the matter is not public yet. A Barclays spokesman declined to comment. Most recently, Garcia helped advise a group of Chinese investors  who took OmniVision Technologies Inc, a maker of chips for smartphone and tablet cameras, private for about $1.9 billion in cash.He also advised German chipmaker Infineon Technologies  which agreed to buy California-based International Rectifier last August for about $3 billion in cash. Earlier in his career, he worked on the sale of GlobalFoundries to Mubadala Group. Barclays already has a strong practice in semiconductors, which is one of the busiest areas in technology dealmaking lately. It represented Silicon Image earlier this year on its sale to Lattice Semiconductor Corp.It also has a track record working with Avago Technologies Limited, representing the company on its acquisition of Emulex Corp this year and larger deals such as Avago's $6.6 billion acquisition of LSI in 2014.The tech, media and telecom group at Barclays has been undergoing changes in recent months. In March it said it had brought on former Blackstone Group LP advisory banker Peter Cohen as its global head of media banking. It also lost a senior software banker, George Patterson, in April.

450,"   By Nate Raymond  A former Bank of America Corp executive was sentenced to 2 years and two months in prison on Monday after pleading guilty to participating in a scheme to defraud cities and towns by rigging bids to invest municipal bond proceeds.Phillip Murphy, 57, the former managing director of Bank of America's municipal derivatives products desk, was the last of 17 convicted defendants to be sentenced in a case spilling out of a broad bid-rigging investigation involving the $3.7 trillion municipal bond market.The investigation resulted in five banks agreeing to pay $743 million to settle with federal and state authorities, including Bank of America, which reached a $137.3 million deal in 2010. The U.S. Justice Department said Murphy conspired with brokerage CDR Financial Products and others to increase the quantity and profitability of investment and other municipal finance contacts awarded to Bank of America.Prosecutors said Murphy won investment contracts thanks to the Beverly Hills, California-based CDR's manipulation of the bidding process to obtain losing bids from other banks.

452,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) LONDON, May 19 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has upgraded Bank of America's (BAC)  Viability Rating (VR) to 'a' from 'a-'. At the same time, the agency has  affirmed BAC's Long-Term and Short-Term Issuer-Default Ratings (IDRs) at 'A' and  'F1', respectively. The Rating Outlooks for the Long-Term IDRs are Stable. BAC's's Long-Term IDR is now driven by its VR, which has been upgraded to 'a'  from 'a-'. The upgrade of BAC's's material legal operating subsidiaries' IDRs to  one notch above their VRs reflects the expected implementation of total loss  absorbing capital (TLAC) requirements for U.S. Global Systemically Important  Banks (G-SIBs) and the presence of a substantial debt buffer in the holding  company. A full list of rating actions follows at the end of this rating action  commentary. The rating actions are in conjunction with Fitch's review of sovereign support  for banks globally, which the agency announced in March 2014. In line with its  expectations announced in March last year and communicated regularly since then,  Fitch believes legislative, regulatory and policy initiatives have substantially  reduced the likelihood of sovereign support for U.S., Swiss and European Union  commercial banks. At the same time, Fitch has taken into account progress with  the U.S. single point of entry (SPE) resolution regime and TLAC implementation  for U.S. G-SIBs. Fitch believes that, in line with our Support Rating (SR) definition of '5',  extraordinary external support while possible can no longer be relied upon for  BAC or its subsidiaries. We have, therefore, downgraded their Support Ratings  (SR) to '5' from '1' and revised their Support Rating Floors (SRF) to 'No Floor'  from 'A'. The upgrade of BAC's VR is driven by the maintenance of good capital and  liquidity levels, materially lower looming litigation costs than at any point  over the last few years, as well as the company's slowly improving earnings  profile. The ratings actions are also part of a periodic portfolio review of the Global  Trading and Universal Banks (GTUBs), which comprise 12 large and globally active  banking groups. A strong rebound in earnings from securities businesses in 1Q15  is a reminder of the upside potential banks with leading market shares can  enjoy. However, regulatory headwinds remain strong, with ever higher capital  requirements, costs of continuous infrastructure upgrades and a focus on conduct  risks.  As capital and leverage requirements evolve, GTUBs are reviewing the balance of  their securities operations with other businesses and adapting their business  models to provide the most capital platforms for the future. We expect the  GTUBs' other core businesses, including retail and corporate banking, wealth and  asset management, to perform well as economic growth, which we expect to be  strongest in the U.S. and UK, will underpin revenue. However, pressure on  revenue generation in a low-interest environment is likely to persist,  particularly in Europe, but low loan impairment charges in domestic markets  should help operating profitability. KEY RATING DRIVERS - IDRs, VR AND SENIOR DEBT The upgrade of BAC's VR is driven by the maintenance of good capital and  liquidity levels, materially lower looming litigation costs than at any point  over the last few years, as well as the company's slowly improving earnings  profile. It is this latter point, which Fitch believes has the most weight in warranting  the upgrade of the VR. Fitch believes that now that the bulk of BAC's large  legal settlements are behind it, the strength of BAC's suite of core franchises  will slowly become more evident. Fitch believes that BAC's management has done a good job resolving the company's  large litigation exposures as well as beginning to streamline the company's  operations, which at first was through the company's 'New BAC' initiatives and  more recently through its ongoing 'Simplify and Improve' program. Fitch thinks there is still ample room for BAC to improve its sustainable  earnings power through cost reductions and other efficiency initiatives.  Chief among these opportunities is continuing to reduce costs from the company's  Legacy Assets & Servicing (LAS) segment as more and more of BAC's problem assets  are resolved or sold. The main cost reduction benefit here will be through  reduced headcount in the LAS segment. In its core on-going operations, Fitch would expect BAC to continue to optimize  overall branch network through branch closures, the rolling out of reformatted  branches, as well as headcount reductions across its branch banking platform. Fitch would also expect BAC to continue to rationalize its overall staffing  levels by utilizing technology more efficiently, reducing redundant operations,  and simplifying its business processes. To the extent that management is successful in this effort -- which Fitch has  already observed some positive results -- the company's efficiency ratio  (non-interest expenses divided by total revenues), and Fitch believes it could  drop from the low 70 percentage range to the high 60 percentage range over a  longer-term time horizon.  Furthermore to the extent that this potential efficiency ratio improvement is  sustainable it could push BAC's Fitch calculated adjusted pre-tax ROA  consistently above 1.00% (it was 0.89% in 1Q15), and therefore much closer to  peer averages. When Fitch also considers that now that management is more focused on driving  the business than dealing with legacy issues, BAC's revenue growth should also  improve, which could also help boost the company's returns over a medium term  time horizon. Finally, to the extent that Short-Term interest rates eventually rise BAC may  get a stronger earnings benefit than peers given its proportionately larger  retail deposit base than peers.  Fitch would expect retail checking and savings deposits -- the bulk of BAC's  funding profile -- to re-price more slowly than other forms of funding in a  rising Short-Term interest rate scenario. This should provide a stronger boost  to the net interest margin of firms like BAC, with proportionately larger  amounts of retail deposits, than other peer institutions.  To the extent that BAC is able to generate incremental revenue through either of  the avenues described above, Fitch believes it's likely to further improve the  efficiency ratio (revenue is the denominator in the efficiency ratio), and  therefore BAC's overall earnings profile. The VRs remain equalized between BAC and its material operating subsidiaries.  The common VR of BAC and its operating companies reflects the correlated  performance, or failure rate between the BAC and these subsidiaries. Fitch takes  a group view on the credit profile from a failure perspective, while the IDR  reflects each entity's non-performance (default) risk on senior debt. Fitch  believes that the likelihood of failure is roughly equivalent, while the default  risk given at the operating company would be lower given TLAC. All U.S. bank  subsidiaries carry a common VR, regardless of size, as U.S. banks are  cross-guaranteed under the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and  Enforcement Act (FIRREA).  The Long-Term IDRs for the material U.S. operating entities are one notch above  BAC's to reflect Fitch's belief that the U.S. single point of entry (SPE)  resolution regime, the likely implementation of total loss absorbing capital  (TLAC) requirements for U.S. G-SIBs, and the presence of substantial holding  company debt reduces the default risk of domestic operating subsidiaries' senior  liabilities relative to holding company senior debt. In our view these buffers  would provide substantial protection to senior unsecured obligations in the  domestic operating entities in the event of group resolution, as they could be  used to absorb losses and recapitalize operating companies. Therefore,  substantial holding company debt reduces the likelihood of default on operating  company senior obligations. As at end-2014, BAC had hybrid and senior debt as a  percent of risk-weighted assets (RWA) of greater than 20%, more than its Pillar  1 capital requirement. The 'F1+' Short-Term IDRs of BAC's's bank subsidiaries is at the higher of two  potential Short-Term IDRs mapping to an 'A+' Long-Term IDR on Fitch's rating  scale to reflect substantial liquidity at the banks and typically higher core  deposit funding, further liquidity resources at BAC that could be extended to  the bank and access to further contingent liquidity sources such as Federal Home  Loan Bank advances. BAC and its non-bank operating companies Short-Term IDRs at  'F1' reflect Fitch's view that there is less surplus liquidity at these entities  than at the bank, particularly given their greater reliance on the holding  company for liquidity.  RATING SENSITIVITIES - IDRs, VR AND SENIOR DEBT With today's upgrade of BAC's VR Fitch sees limited downside to BAC's ratings  and notes that the company's ratings are likely near the lower-end of their  potential range. Further upside to BAC's VR would likely be predicated on continuing to improve  the company's earnings performance such that BAC's returns consistently exceed  those of peers as well as the company's cost of equity, which Fitch estimates to  be approximately 12%, over an extended period. Fitch notes that this would likely require BAC to sustainably improve its  efficiency ratio to the mid-to-high 50's through some of both the cost reduction  initiatives and revenue growth opportunities described above. Should management be unable to achieve these targets over a longer-term time  horizon, it is likely that ratings would remain at current levels. Downside risks to ratings, while not expected, include any remaining litigation  exposures or other unforeseen charges that result in a significant net earnings  loss, or if the company's regulatory or tangible capital ratios begin to  meaningfully decline. Additionally, should BAC's overall credit quality materially deteriorate over  the near term, or the company experience a severe and unexpected risk management  failure this could also negatively impact the VR. KEY RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES - SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR  The SR and SRF reflect Fitch's view that senior creditors can no longer rely on  receiving full extraordinary support from the sovereign in the event that BAC  becomes non-viable. In Fitch's view, implementation of the Dodd Frank Orderly  Liquidation Authority legislation is now sufficiently progressed to provide a  framework for resolving banks that is likely to require holding company senior  creditors participating in losses, if necessary, instead of or ahead of the  company receiving sovereign support. Any upward revision to the SR and SRF would be contingent on a positive change  in the U.S.'s propensity to support its banks. While not impossible, this is  highly unlikely in Fitch's view.  KEY RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES - SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID  SECURITIES Subordinated debt and other hybrid capital issued by BAC are all notched down  from the common VR in accordance with Fitch's assessment of each instrument's  respective non-performance and relative loss severity risk profiles, which vary  considerably. Subordinated debt issued by the operating companies is rated at  the same level as subordinated debt issued by BAC reflecting the potential for  subordinated creditors in the operating companies to be exposed to loss ahead of  senior creditors in BAC. This is also supported by the FSB's proposal to have  internal TLAC rank senior to regulatory capital at the operating company. Their  ratings are primarily sensitive to any change in the common VR. They have,  therefore, been upgraded due to the upgrade of the common VR. KEY RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES - DEPOSIT RATINGS The upgrade of Bank of America N.A's deposit ratings is based on the upgrade of  its IDR. Deposit ratings are one notch higher than senior debt reflecting the  deposits' superior recovery prospects in case of default given depositor  preference in the U.S. BAC's international subsidiaries' deposit ratings are at  the same level as their senior debt ratings because their preferential status is  less clear and disclosure concerning dually payable deposits makes it difficult  to determine if they are eligible for U.S. depositor preference. MATERIAL INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES KEY RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES Merrill Lynch International (MLI) and Merrill Lynch International Bank Ltd  (MLIB) wholly owned subsidiaries of BAC whose IDRs and debt ratings are aligned  with BAC's because of their core strategic role in and integration into the BAC  group. Fitch has revised the Rating Outlook for BAC's material international  operating companies' IDRs to Positive. The revision is in light of the internal  pre-positioning required under the Financial Stability Board's (FSB) TLAC  proposal. The Positive Outlook reflects the agency's belief that the internal  TLAC of material international operating companies will likely be large enough  to meet Pillar 1 capital requirements and will then be sufficient to  recapitalize them. A one notch upgrade is likely once Fitch has sufficient  clarity on additional disclosure on the pre-positioning of internal TLAC and its  sufficiency in size to cover a default of senior operating company liabilities.  Sufficient clarity may, however, take longer to come through than the typical  Outlook horizon of one to two years  MLI and MLIB's ratings are sensitive to the same factors that might drive a  change in BAC's IDRs. OTHER SUBSIDIARY KEY RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES Non-material legal entities IDRs and debt ratings are aligned with the ratings  of BAC.  Those domestic subsidiaries and international subsidiaries that have not been  upgraded or placed on Rating Outlook Positive are in Fitch's opinion not  sufficiently material to benefit from domestic support from BAC or are  international subsidiaries that would not benefit from internal TLAC.

453,"  NEW YORK May 19 Bank of America's  Merrill Lynch said Tuesday it hired an elite team of three brokers away from rival brokerage Morgan Stanley, where they had produced nearly $4 million in fees and revenues last year.The group, which is led by John Mirsepahi and includes Matthew Cali and Matthew Zamora, joined Merrill Lynch's office in Rockefeller Center in New York on May 14.A 20-year-industry veteran, Mirsepahi started at Paine Webber, a firm that was later bought by UBS AG. He later worked at Merrill Lynch from 1999 to 2005, leaving to join CitiGroup's brokerage unit and later Morgan Stanley, according to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority's (FINRA) BrokerCheck website. In 2014, Mirsepahi was named a top U.S. advisor by Barron's. Mirsepahi's group, referred to as The J.M. Group, advises ultra high net worth and family office clients on fixed income investments, liability management and alternative investments. In a statement released by Bank of America, Mirsepahi said the group was attracted to Merrill Lynch because of the firm's access to Bank of America's banking and lending products.A Morgan Stanley spokeswoman confirmed the three left the firm, but declined to comment further.

454,"   By Jonathan Stempel | NEW YORK  NEW YORK U.S. Bancorp and Bank of America Corp won a dismissal of claims in lawsuits accusing them of breaching their duties as trustees for residential mortgage-backed securities that suffered losses tied to the global financial crisis.The dismissals came in three decisions late Monday by U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest in Manhattan.In the first, Forrest rejected an attempt by funds from BlackRock Inc, Allianz SE's Pacific Investment Management Co and TIAA-CREF to hold US Bancorp liable for alleged defects in 843 RMBS trusts collateralized by $778.6 billion of loans, causing tens of billions of dollars of losses.The judge said the funds pleaded their claims incorrectly as to 33 trusts, and said she lacked jurisdiction over the other 810 trusts in light of a December ruling by the federal appeals court in Manhattan concerning Bank of New York Mellon Corp . Separately, Forrest said the National Credit Union Administration lacked standing to sue US Bancorp and Bank of America over 74 RMBS trusts from which five corporate credit unions that later failed had bought certificates, because the certificates had been re-securitized.In the third case, Forrest dismissed claims by several Ireland- and Cayman Islands-based entities against US Bancorp and Bank of America, also saying the plaintiffs lacked standing. The judge gave all plaintiffs a chance to amend their complaints.Blair Nicholas, a lawyer for the BlackRock, Pimco and TIAA-CREF plaintiffs, declined to comment. A lawyer for the NCUA and foreign plaintiffs did not immediately respond to requests for comment. US Bancorp spokesman Dana Ripley and Bank of America spokesman Lawrence Grayson declined to comment. Bond issuers appoint trustees to ensure that payments are funneled to investors, as well as to handle much of the back-office work after securities are sold.Trustees have in recent years become a growing target for investors seeking to recoup losses on shoddy mortgages. They accuse the trustees of breaching their duties by failing to force lenders and bond issuers to buy back troubled loans.Investors have had mixed success suing trustees. Bank of America and US Bancorp last November agreed to pay $69 million to settle a lawsuit over their role as trustees for RMBS backed by loans from the failed Washington Mutual Inc.The cases in the U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, are BlackRock Allocation Target Shares: Series S Portfolio et al v.

461,"   By Lawrence Hurley | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday handed a win to Bank of America Corp by ruling that a second mortgage on an ""underwater"" home - one with a mortgage balance exceeding its current value - cannot by voided during bankruptcy.On a unanimous vote, the court ruled against two homeowners, David Caulkett and Edelmiro Toledo-Cardona, in Florida, where many homeowners have struggled to pay their mortgages following the recent housing crisis. Caulkett and Toledo-Cardona had both won before the regional appeals court that oversees Florida. The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals had ruled that homeowners in Chapter 7 bankruptcy can void - or in bankruptcy terms ""strip off"" - a second mortgage when the debt owed to the holder of the first mortgage is more than the property's current value.That means the lender loses its ability to foreclose on the property even if its value increases. But Bank of America, which is the second mortgage holder in both cases, argued in court papers that the approach taken by the 11th Circuit was different than other appeals courts around the country. The cases are Bank of America v. Caulkett and Bank of America v. Toledo-Cardona, U.S. Supreme Court, Nos. 13-1421 and 14-163.",2015-06-01,BAC,"Mon Jun 1, 2015 | 10:34am EDT",U.S. top court says 2nd mortgages on 'underwater' homes cannot be voided in bankruptcy,http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-court-bankruptcy-idUSL1N0YN12C20150601?type=companyNews

466,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, June 11 (Fitch) This announcement amends a previous release regarding  Bank of America Corporation and subsidiaries published on May 19, 2015. The  correction includes revising the Rating Outlook for the company's Bank of  America Merrill Lynch International subsidiary to Positive from Stable.  Fitch Ratings has upgraded Bank of America's (BAC) Viability Rating (VR) to 'a'  from 'a-'. At the same time, the agency has affirmed BAC's Long-Term and  Short-Term Issuer-Default Ratings (IDRs) at 'A' and 'F1', respectively. The  Rating Outlooks for the Long-Term IDRs are Stable. BAC's Long-Term IDR is now driven by its VR, which has been upgraded to 'a' from  'a-'. The upgrade of BAC's material legal operating subsidiaries' IDRs to one  notch above their VRs reflects the expected implementation of total loss  absorbing capital (TLAC) requirements for U.S. Global Systemically Important  Banks (G-SIBs) and the presence of a substantial debt buffer in the holding  company. A full list of rating actions follows at the end of this rating action  commentary. The rating actions are in conjunction with Fitch's review of sovereign support  for banks globally, which the agency announced in March 2014. In line with its  expectations announced in March last year and communicated regularly since then,  Fitch believes legislative, regulatory and policy initiatives have substantially  reduced the likelihood of sovereign support for U.S., Swiss and European Union  commercial banks. At the same time, Fitch has taken into account progress with  the U.S. single point of entry (SPE) resolution regime and TLAC implementation  for U.S. G-SIBs. Fitch believes that, in line with our Support Rating (SR) definition of '5',  extraordinary external support while possible can no longer be relied upon for  BAC or its subsidiaries. Fitch has, therefore, downgraded their Support Ratings  (SR) to '5' from '1' and revised their Support Rating Floors (SRF) to 'No Floor'  from 'A'. The upgrade of BAC's VR is driven by the maintenance of good capital and  liquidity levels, materially lower looming litigation costs than at any point  over the last few years, as well as the company's slowly improving earnings  profile. The ratings actions are also part of a periodic portfolio review of the Global  Trading and Universal Banks (GTUBs), which comprise 12 large and globally active  banking groups. A strong rebound in earnings from securities businesses in 1Q15  is a reminder of the upside potential banks with leading market shares can  enjoy. However, regulatory headwinds remain strong, with ever higher capital  requirements, costs of continuous infrastructure upgrades and a focus on conduct  risks.  As capital and leverage requirements evolve, GTUBs are reviewing the balance of  their securities operations with other businesses and adapting their business  models to provide the most capital platforms for the future. Fitch expects the  GTUBs' other core businesses, including retail and corporate banking, wealth and  asset management, to perform well as economic growth, which the agency expects  to be strongest in the U.S. and UK, will underpin revenue. However, pressure on  revenue generation in a low-interest environment is likely to persist,  particularly in Europe, but low loan impairment charges in domestic markets  should help operating profitability. KEY RATING DRIVERS - IDRs, VR AND SENIOR DEBT The upgrade of BAC's VR is driven by the maintenance of good capital and  liquidity levels, materially lower looming litigation costs than at any point  over the last few years, as well as the company's slowly improving earnings  profile. It is this latter point, which Fitch believes has the most weight in warranting  the upgrade of the VR. Fitch believes that now that the bulk of BAC's large  legal settlements are behind it, the strength of BAC's suite of core franchises  will slowly become more evident. Fitch believes that BAC's management has done a good job resolving the company's  large litigation exposures as well as beginning to streamline the company's  operations, which at first was through the company's 'New BAC' initiatives and  more recently through its ongoing 'Simplify and Improve' program. Fitch thinks there is still ample room for BAC to improve its sustainable  earnings power through cost reductions and other efficiency initiatives.  Chief among these opportunities is continuing to reduce costs from the company's  Legacy Assets & Servicing (LAS) segment as more and more of BAC's problem assets  are resolved or sold. The main cost reduction benefit here will be through  reduced headcount in the LAS segment. In its core on-going operations, Fitch would expect BAC to continue to optimize  overall branch network through branch closures, the rolling out of reformatted  branches, as well as headcount reductions across its branch banking platform. Fitch would also expect BAC to continue to rationalize its overall staffing  levels by utilizing technology more efficiently, reducing redundant operations,  and simplifying its business processes. To the extent that management is successful in this effort -- which Fitch has  already observed some positive results -- the company's efficiency ratio  (non-interest expenses divided by total revenues), and Fitch believes it could  drop from the low 70 percentage range to the high 60 percentage range over a  longer-term time horizon.  Furthermore, to the extent that this potential efficiency ratio improvement is  sustainable it could push BAC's Fitch calculated adjusted pre-tax ROA  consistently above 1.00% (it was 0.89% in 1Q15), and therefore much closer to  peer averages. When Fitch also considers that now that management is more focused on driving  the business than dealing with legacy issues, BAC's revenue growth should also  improve, which could also help boost the company's returns over a medium term  time horizon. Finally, to the extent that short-term interest rates eventually rise BAC may  get a stronger earnings benefit than peers given its proportionately larger  retail deposit base than peers.  Fitch would expect retail checking and savings deposits -- the bulk of BAC's  funding profile -- to re-price more slowly than other forms of funding in a  rising Short-Term interest rate scenario. This should provide a stronger boost  to the net interest margin of firms like BAC, with proportionately larger  amounts of retail deposits, than other peer institutions.  To the extent that BAC is able to generate incremental revenue through either of  the avenues described above, Fitch believes it's likely to further improve the  efficiency ratio (revenue is the denominator in the efficiency ratio), and  therefore BAC's overall earnings profile. The VRs remain equalized between BAC and its material operating subsidiaries.  The common VR of BAC and its operating companies reflects the correlated  performance, or failure rate between the BAC and these subsidiaries. Fitch takes  a group view on the credit profile from a failure perspective, while the IDR  reflects each entity's non-performance (default) risk on senior debt. Fitch  believes that the likelihood of failure is roughly equivalent, while the default  risk given at the operating company would be lower given TLAC. All U.S. bank  subsidiaries carry a common VR, regardless of size, as U.S. banks are  cross-guaranteed under the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and  Enforcement Act (FIRREA).  The Long-Term IDRs for the material U.S. operating entities are one notch above  BAC's to reflect Fitch's belief that the U.S. single point of entry (SPE)  resolution regime, the likely implementation of total loss absorbing capital  (TLAC) requirements for U.S. G-SIBs, and the presence of substantial holding  company debt reduces the default risk of domestic operating subsidiaries' senior  liabilities relative to holding company senior debt. In Fitch's views these  buffers would provide substantial protection to senior unsecured obligations in  the domestic operating entities in the event of group resolution, as they could  be used to absorb losses and recapitalize operating companies. Therefore,  substantial holding company debt reduces the likelihood of default on operating  company senior obligations. As at end-2014, BAC had hybrid and senior debt as a  percent of risk-weighted assets (RWA) of greater than 20%, more than its Pillar  1 capital requirement. The 'F1+' Short-Term IDRs of BAC's bank subsidiaries is at the higher of two  potential Short-Term IDRs mapping to an 'A+' Long-Term IDR on Fitch's rating  scale to reflect substantial liquidity at the banks and typically higher core  deposit funding, further liquidity resources at BAC that could be extended to  the bank and access to further contingent liquidity sources such as Federal Home  Loan Bank advances. BAC and its non-bank operating companies Short-Term IDRs at  'F1' reflect Fitch's view that there is less surplus liquidity at these entities  than at the bank, particularly given their greater reliance on the holding  company for liquidity.  KEY RATING SENSITIVITIES - IDRs, VR AND SENIOR DEBT With the upgrade of BAC's VR, Fitch sees limited downside to BAC's ratings and  notes that the company's ratings are likely near the lower-end of their  potential range. Further upside to BAC's VR would likely be predicated on continuing to improve  the company's earnings performance such that BAC's returns consistently exceed  those of peers as well as the company's cost of equity, which Fitch estimates to  be approximately 12%, over an extended period. Fitch notes that this would likely require BAC to sustainably improve its  efficiency ratio to the mid-to-high 50's through some of both the cost reduction  initiatives and revenue growth opportunities described above. Should management be unable to achieve these targets over a longer-term time  horizon, it is likely that ratings would remain at current levels. Downside risks to ratings, while not expected, include any remaining litigation  exposures or other unforeseen charges that result in a significant net earnings  loss, or if the company's regulatory or tangible capital ratios begin to  meaningfully decline. Additionally, should BAC's overall credit quality materially deteriorate over  the near term, or the company experience a severe and unexpected risk management  failure this could also negatively impact the VR. KEY RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES - SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR  The SR and SRF reflect Fitch's view that senior creditors can no longer rely on  receiving full extraordinary support from the sovereign in the event that BAC  becomes non-viable. In Fitch's view, implementation of the Dodd Frank Orderly  Liquidation Authority legislation is now sufficiently progressed to provide a  framework for resolving banks that is likely to require holding company senior  creditors participating in losses, if necessary, instead of or ahead of the  company receiving sovereign support. Any upward revision to the SR and SRF would be contingent on a positive change  in the U.S.'s propensity to support its banks. While not impossible, this is  highly unlikely in Fitch's view.  KEY RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES - SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID  SECURITIES Subordinated debt and other hybrid capital issued by BAC are all notched down  from the common VR in accordance with Fitch's assessment of each instrument's  respective non-performance and relative loss severity risk profiles, which vary  considerably. Subordinated debt issued by the operating companies is rated at  the same level as subordinated debt issued by BAC reflecting the potential for  subordinated creditors in the operating companies to be exposed to loss ahead of  senior creditors in BAC. This is also supported by the FSB's proposal to have  internal TLAC rank senior to regulatory capital at the operating company. Their  ratings are primarily sensitive to any change in the common VR. They have,  therefore, been upgraded due to the upgrade of the common VR. KEY RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES - DEPOSIT RATINGS The upgrade of Bank of America N.A's deposit ratings is based on the upgrade of  its IDR. Deposit ratings are one notch higher than senior debt reflecting the  deposits' superior recovery prospects in case of default given depositor  preference in the U.S. BAC's international subsidiaries' deposit ratings are at  the same level as their senior debt ratings because their preferential status is  less clear and disclosure concerning dually payable deposits makes it difficult  to determine if they are eligible for U.S. depositor preference. MATERIAL INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES KEY RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES Merrill Lynch International (MLI), Merrill Lynch International Bank Ltd (MLIB),  and Bank of America Merrill Lynch International Limited are wholly owned  subsidiaries of BAC whose IDRs and debt ratings are aligned with BAC's because  of their core strategic role in and integration into the BAC group. Fitch has  revised the Rating Outlook for BAC's material international operating companies'  IDRs to Positive. The revision is in light of the internal pre-positioning  required under the Financial Stability Board's (FSB) TLAC proposal. The Positive  Outlook reflects the agency's belief that the internal TLAC of material  international operating companies will likely be large enough to meet Pillar 1  capital requirements and will then be sufficient to recapitalize them. A one  notch upgrade is likely once Fitch has sufficient clarity on additional  disclosure on the pre-positioning of internal TLAC and its sufficiency in size  to cover a default of senior operating company liabilities. Sufficient clarity  may, however, take longer to come through than the typical Outlook horizon of  one to two years  MLI and MLIB's ratings are sensitive to the same factors that might drive a  change in BAC's IDRs. OTHER SUBSIDIARY KEY RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES Non-material legal entities IDRs and debt ratings are aligned with the ratings  of BAC.  Those domestic subsidiaries and international subsidiaries that have not been  upgraded or placed on Rating Outlook Positive are in Fitch's opinion not  sufficiently material to benefit from domestic support from BAC or are  international subsidiaries that would not benefit from internal TLAC.

473,"   By Lauren Hirsch and Olivia Oran | July 8  July 8 ConAgra Foods Inc has hired Centerview Partners to explore a sale of its private label unit Ralcorp, just two years after it acquired the troubled business with advice from the same investment bank, people familiar with the matter said.The maker of Chef Boyardee and Slim Jim snacks, which last month announced it would exit its private label food business, also has hired Goldman Sachs Group Inc to provide additional advice on the sale, the people said this week.Representatives for ConAgra, Centerview and Goldman declined to comment. ConAgra relied on Centerview and Bank of America Corp  for advice when it acquired Ralcorp in January 2013 for $5.1 billion. Goldman advised Ralcorp alongside Barclays Plc .At the time, the deal was viewed as a personal success for then-ConAgra CEO Gary Rodkin, who had pursued Ralcorp for more than a year and a half. But Ralcorp, which makes private label cereal, pasta, crackers, jams and jellies, syrups and frozen waffles, has been plagued with problems ranging from customer service issues to pricing concessions. Sales have fallen nearly 6 percent in the past two years. Activist fund Jana Partners announced a 7.2 percent stake in ConAgra last month and said it would push to nominate directors to the company's board that supported its desire to exit the private label business.ConAgra Chief Executive Sean Connolly, who joined the company in April, has said the effort to fix Ralcorp was draining resources.""We know that the inconsistency of our past performance is totally unacceptable,"" Connolly said in an earnings call last month.

474,"   By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed | NEW YORK, July 10  NEW YORK, July 10 With a slew of big banks reporting results next week, the key financial exchange traded fund has been drawing strong inflows, and trading in its options appears bullish.The Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund, which tracks the S&P 500 financials sector, is up 1 percent this year and touched a seven-year high of $25.31, on June 18. The shares have fallen as much as 5 percent since then.Investors, however, have been pouring money into the fund, and for the seven days ending July 8, the ETF had its biggest weekly inflow since 2008, according to Lipper data.While flows, which tend to strengthen when a security's price is already rising, can gyrate for different reasons, it is likely that the inflows stem from investors looking for a rebound, said Jason Goepfert, founder of Sundial Capital Research.Seven of the fund's top ten holdings, including Bank of America Corp, JPMorgan Chase & Co Inc, and Goldman Sachs Group Inc, are expected to report results next week. ""Investors are expecting some better earnings out of the banks next week, compared to the broad S&P,"" said Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors in New York.Second quarter earnings for the financials sector are estimated to grow 14.9 percent, the best among the ten S&P sectors, according to Thomson Reuters data.Traders in the options market also appear to be getting more optimistic. Since June, the ETF's call options, usually used to place bullish bets, have drawn increased activity. For each put, there are 1.2 calls open, roughly the highest such ratio since April 2012, according to Trade Alert data.""Most people are bullish on financials,"" said Peter Cecchini, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald. ""The sentiment starts positively with the fact that U.S. bank balance sheets look pretty darned good right now,"" he said.The top three blocks of open interest in the financial ETF, are in calls and account for a fifth of all open contracts. September calls at the $26 strike price are the biggest block with about 363,000 contracts open. The ETF's shares were up 1 percent at $24.60 on Friday.A possible Federal Reserve interest rate hike later this year might also be on the minds of some investors, strategists said.""If you are a believer that the Fed is going to start to normalize policy, financials are a category that should work,"" Orlando said.

475,"   By Dan Freed | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) Chief Executive Brian Moynihan has been hiring more sales staff in areas ranging from commercial lending to wealth management, in his latest effort to boost revenue that has barely budged for years.The hires are part of Moynihan's efforts to push the bank to sell more products to more customers. That strategy, known as ""cross-selling,"" can be lucrative if done properly, and is part of the defense the bank gives to investors who question whether the second-biggest U.S. bank should be smaller. The potential to cross-sell drove Bank of America to buy many companies, including Merrill Lynch and mortgage lender Countrywide Financial, before and during the financial crisis.But cross-selling is hard, and Moynihan has struggled to execute the strategy as successfully as Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), a bank that consistently generates more quarterly profit than Bank of America with fewer assets. Increasing revenue is the next great challenge for Moynihan, who has spent much of the last several years fixing the bank's legal problems. Bank of America said on Wednesday that its legal costs dropped for a second straight quarter, and analysts are increasingly confident that huge, multi-billion dollar settlements are largely in its past. Moynihan recently has been focusing on hiring additional specialized sales people who can refer customers to other specialists as necessary, a shift from his prior strategy of training each employee that deals with customers to sell more products. So instead of a bank teller trying to sell a branch customer a credit card and a mortgage, the teller might refer the client to a home loan specialist.Before he can take a view on whether Bank of America’s strategy makes sense, CLSA analyst Mike Mayo said he wants the bank to be clearer about how it will lead to increased sales.   ""Clearly they want more feet on the floor talking to clients. The question is how much will it cost, will it gain traction and which metrics are they trying to achieve?"" Mayo said.Bank of America is one of several major U.S. banks struggling with weak revenue as low interest rates cut into lending income.LIMITED IMPACT SO FAR The bank's new hires have so far had a limited impact. Bank of America on Wednesday posted a tepid 1.7 percent increase in second-quarter revenue from the same period a year ago. Quarterly revenue at Bank of America has hovered around $22 billion since 2011.  The bank has added some 1,000 financial advisers since the second quarter of 2014, and increased the number of sales specialists for products like mortgages by 3.5 percent to 6,963. On a call with analysts, Moynihan said that increasing the number of specialized sales staffers is important.""It is really just having more of them,"" he said.Chief Financial Officer Bruce Thompson told reporters on a conference call, ""Ultimately revenues are driven by the number of client-facing personnel that you have and how well they do relative to their peers.""Despite the focus on hiring sales specialists, the bank is laying off staff overall as it seeks to offset the weak revenue growth by cutting costs. The ranks of full-time employees in its consumer banking business dwindled nearly 10 percent from the year-ago quarter to fewer than 66,000. Bank of America has a regular cost-cutting program in place it calls ""Simplify and Improve."" Spokesman Jerry Dubrowski said Bank of America has been steadily increasing its sales force for some time.But that expansion has been uneven, with growth in the ranks of sales specialists for small business loans and other products but fluctuations in the number of financial advisers. Bank of America does not disclose the size of its sales force for loans to larger businesses.Boosting sales is a challenge for Bank of America partly because it already does business with one out of every two American households.Still, hopes that units like Merrill Lynch can bring in clients who will buy products from other parts of the bank has long underpinned the bank's strategy. ""We will now be able to more effectively serve the retail clients throughout their life cycle from college and home loans to...investments for college through retirement,"" then chief executive Ken Lewis said just after the Merrill takeover deal was struck at the height of the 2008 financial crisis.Some investors have questioned whether that strategy makes sense. At Bank of America's annual meeting this year, investors voted on a proposal that called for the company to consider spinning off its investment banking business. The ballot measure failed.

476,"   By Richa Naidu and Anil D'Silva  Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), the No. 2 U.S. bank by assets, reported its biggest quarterly profit in nearly four years as expenses fell to their lowest since the financial crisis.BofA, which has paid at least $70 billion in legal expenses since 2008, said its legal costs fell for the second straight quarter, suggesting the bank was finally putting to rest its problems stemming from the crisis.Litigation expenses fell to $175 million from $4 billion a year earlier, allowing the bank to reap the benefits of the cost cuts introduced by Chief Executive Brian Moynihan after he assumed the top job at the bank in 2010. BofA's non-interest expenses fell by a quarter to $13.82 billion in the three months to June 30.At the same time, net interest income rose 4.7 percent to $10.49 billion - the first rise in five quarters.""We also benefited from the improvement in the U.S. economy, where we are particularly well positioned,"" Moynihan said.BofA's core net interest income is expected to rise over the rest of 2015 even without interest rate hikes, Chief Financial Officer Bruce Thompson said on a conference call.The bank's legacy assets and servicing unit, which houses many of the bad loans BofA inherited with its purchase of Countrywide Financial, also posted a small profit compared with a loss of $2.7 billion in the year-earlier quarter.The gain was driven by a recent court ruling that said New York's six-year statute of limitations on lawsuits related to mortgage-backed securities should start when investors initially buy mortgage-backed securities, not when issuers refuse to buy back or replace them. Net income attributable to shareholders more than doubled to $4.99 billion, or 45 cents per share, in the quarter from $2.04 billion, or 19 cents per share, a year earlier.The results were helped by a one-time accounting adjustment on mortgage bonds linked to rising interest rates.On an adjusted basis, BofA earned 37 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, beating the average analyst estimate of 36 cents.BofA's shares were up 4 percent at $17.83 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday. MORTGAGE REVENUE JUMPS The fourth-biggest U.S. mortgage lender said its mortgage banking revenue almost doubled to $1 billion.More than half of the quarter's new mortgage loans were for home purchases, rather than the refinancings that previously drove revenue in the business.Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), the biggest issuer of mortgages in the United States, reported a drop of 1 percent in revenue from its home-lending business on Tuesday.BofA said its income from investment and brokerage services rose 3 percent to $3.39 billion, while revenue from the bank's Merrill Lynch Global Wealth Management business was little changed at $3.79 billion. Moynihan, on a conference call with analysts, said Merrill Lynch still had more work to do on expense management.Revenue from bond trading fell 9.3 percent to $2.15 billion.JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), the biggest U.S. bank, said on Tuesday its revenue from fixed-income trading fell 21 percent.Banks were expected to report muted results from bond trading as the Greek debt crisis and uncertainty about the timing of a U.S. rate hike unsettled investors.However, BofA is less exposed to interest rate-sensitive government securities than some of its competitors, focusing more on trading credit instruments such as corporate bonds.Thompson said BofA's headcount was 7 percent lower in the second quarter compared with the same period last year and that he expected a further decline. BofA had 220,000 full-time employees as of March 31.Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and Citigroup Inc (C.N) will report results on Thursday and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) on Monday.

That strategy, known as ""cross-selling,"" can be lucrative if done properly, and is part of the defense the bank gives to investors who question whether the second-biggest U.S. bank should be smaller.The potential to cross-sell drove Bank of America to buy many companies, including Merrill Lynch and mortgage lender Countrywide Financial, before and during the financial crisis.But cross-selling is hard, and Moynihan has struggled to execute the strategy as successfully as Wells Fargo & Co , a bank that consistently generates more quarterly profit than Bank of America with fewer assets.Increasing revenue is the next great challenge for Moynihan, who has spent much of the last several years fixing the bank's legal problems. Bank of America said on Wednesday that its legal costs dropped for a second straight quarter, and analysts are increasingly confident that huge, multi-billion dollar settlements are largely in its past.Moynihan recently has been focusing on hiring additional specialized sales people who can refer customers to other specialists as necessary, a shift from his prior strategy of training each employee that deals with customers to sell more products.So instead of a bank teller trying to sell a branch customer a credit card and a mortgage, the teller might refer the client to a home loan specialist. Before he can take a view on whether Bank of America's strategy makes sense, CLSA analyst Mike Mayo said he wants the bank to be clearer about how it will lead to increased sales.""Clearly they want more feet on the floor talking to clients. The question is how much will it cost, will it gain traction and which metrics are they trying to achieve?"" Mayo said.Bank of America is one of several major U.S. banks struggling with weak revenue as low interest rates cut into lending income. LIMITED IMPACT SO FAR The bank's new hires have so far had a limited impact. Bank of America on Wednesday posted a tepid 1.7 percent increase in second-quarter revenue from the same period a year ago. Quarterly revenue at Bank of America has hovered around $22 billion since 2011.The bank has added some 1,000 financial advisers since the second quarter of 2014, and increased the number of sales specialists for products like mortgages by 3.5 percent to 6,963. On a call with analysts, Moynihan said that increasing the number of specialized sales staffers is important.""It is really just having more of them,"" he said. Chief Financial Officer Bruce Thompson told reporters on a conference call, ""Ultimately revenues are driven by the number of client-facing personnel that you have and how well they do relative to their peers.""Despite the focus on hiring sales specialists, the bank is laying off staff overall as it seeks to offset the weak revenue growth by cutting costs. The ranks of full-time employees in its consumer banking business dwindled nearly 10 percent from the year-ago quarter to fewer than 66,000. Bank of America has a regular cost-cutting program in place it calls ""Simplify and Improve.""Spokesman Jerry Dubrowski said Bank of America has been steadily increasing its sales force for some time.But that expansion has been uneven, with growth in the ranks of sales specialists for small business loans and other products but fluctuations in the number of financial advisers. Bank of America does not disclose the size of its sales force for loans to larger businesses.Boosting sales is a challenge for Bank of America partly because it already does business with one out of every two American households.Still, hopes that units like Merrill Lynch can bring in clients who will buy products from other parts of the bank has long underpinned the bank's strategy.""We will now be able to more effectively serve the retail clients throughout their life cycle from college and home loans to...investments for college through retirement,"" then chief executive Ken Lewis said just after the Merrill takeover deal was struck at the height of the 2008 financial crisis.Some investors have questioned whether that strategy makes sense. At Bank of America's annual meeting this year, investors voted on a proposal that called for the company to consider spinning off its investment banking business. The ballot measure failed.

489,"   By Suzanne Barlyn | NEW YORK  NEW YORK The Iran nuclear pact could eventually help thousands of Iranian-Americans who have struggled with red tape, shuttered accounts, and even criminal prosecution to conduct bank transactions, although relief seems unlikely anytime soon.As Washington tightened sanctions on nearly all trade with Iran in recent years, international banking transfers that most Americans take for granted have become increasingly fraught for the roughly 500,000 U.S.-based Iranian-Americans. Iranian-Americans and their families seeking to send and receive remittances have been hard hit, from students at U.S. universities in need of tuition money from home to Iranian-Americans trying to settle estates of deceased parents in Iran.""My money is there, but I cannot use it here,” said Reza Hedayati, a New York radiologist who has not seen a cent of the proceeds from the recent sale of a family home back in Iran. Hedayati, 70, who moved to the United States in 1973, has yet to figure out how to get the money out of Iran.The historic deal signed last week by Iran and six major powers offers a glimmer of hope for people like Hedayati.It will eventually lift some restrictions on dealing with several major Iranian banks. The U.S. trade ban still makes direct transfers between U.S. and Iranian banks impossible, but the change could open ways for European or Gulf banks to act as intermediaries for money transfers between family members in the United States and Iran.A carve-out to the U.S. trade ban with Iran allows for family remittances, but those funds have to be routed through third-country financial entities that deal with Iran.With a range of non-nuclear U.S. sanctions on Iran staying in place, major banks remain highly wary of dealing with Iranian institutions. The U.S. Treasury Department is not expected to relax its designation of the entire Iranian financial sector as a ""primary money laundering concern.”About a dozen mostly European banks, including HSBC Holdings Plc and BNP Paribas, have paid nearly $14 billion in U.S. penalties for sanctions-busting since 2009.  Nonetheless, some foreign financial institutions will eventually want to test the waters, said Eytan J. Fisch, former assistant policy director for the U.S. Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), which oversees the sanctions.  ""It will be kind of a slow building process but I do think it will happen,"" said Fisch, now a lawyer for Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP in Washington who advises financial institutions.ENSNARED Some transactions, such as selling property in Iran, require a permit from OFAC which also typically authorizes the seller to transfer the proceeds. Lawyers say that the process to get the sale permit can take six months or longer and legal fees can run from $2,000 to $12,000.“A lot of these transactions which are legally possible are logistically challenging,” said Farhad Alavi, a lawyer in Washington who helps Iranian-Americans facilitate remittances to and from Iran.OFAC issues licenses ""on a case-by-case basis consistent with foreign policy and national security,"" the Treasury Department said.

He will be replaced Terry Laughlin, currently president of strategic initiatives.

""Good news is that he will be there until the end of the year to train his successor.""Along with Chief Executive Brian Moynihan, Thompson was considered a face of the company by the investing community. Analysts said they want the new CFO to be visible early on.Moynihan tapped Thompson for the CFO position shortly after he took over the top job in 2010. Thompson, 51, played a big role in steering the bank during its most crucial years following the 2008 financial crisis, when it faced billions of dollars in litigation costs and shrinking profits in a tougher regulatory environment.The management shakeup comes a week after BofA reported its biggest quarterly profit in nearly four years as expenses fell to their lowest since the crisis. Citigroup analyst Keith Horowitz said the news was ""clearly an incremental negative.""""Since (Thompson) was also very effective in delivering the message, he will be missed as investors have had less contact with the rest of the BAC management team,"" Horowitz said in a note.Both Morgan Stanley and Citigroup have given top ratings to the stock, which was down 1.7 percent at $18.13 on the New York Stock Exchange.

500,"  NEW YORK, July 31 Bank of America is likely to hold a shareholder vote this year to determine whether Chief Executive Brian Moynihan should be allowed to retain his title of chairman of the bank's board, a person familiar with the matter said on Friday.In October, Moynihan was named chairman in addition to CEO, a move that angered some investors. Many corporate governance advocates argue that CEOs should not head their boards, to ensure that directors offer sufficiently independent oversight.Bank of America announced just before its annual meeting in May that it would allow shareholders to hold a vote on whether Moynihan should retain the chairmanship. The bank at the time said the vote would take place no later than its 2016 annual meeting. In a proxy filing on Friday, Bank of America disclosed that shareholders of record on Aug. 10 would be able to vote on the matter in a special meeting, but did not give a specific date. The bank did not give a specific date because the Securities and Exchange Commission must first review the proxy, the person familiar with the matter said.

515,"   By Dan Freed  Former Wells Fargo chairman and chief executive Richard Kovacevich said that Bank of America shareholders are wrong to try to strip Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan of his chairman title.Bank of America's shareholders vote next week on whether CEO Moynihan should remain the bank's chairman. But investors often do not know what is best for a company, because they have worse information than managers, Kovacevich told Reuters in a phone interview.""I've probably done more things against the wishes of stockholders than anyone in the history of banking. Ask anyone who’s ever held our stock who was right,"" he said. Kovacevich is no stranger to this issue. He was chairman and chief executive of Wells Fargo from April 2001 through June 2007, and faced ballot measures at the bank's annual meeting that sought to strip him of his chairman title from 2005 through 2007. Kovacevich said he typically won somewhere around 70 percent of the votes when ballot measures sought to remove his chairman title. He held chairman and CEO spots separately during his time at the bank as well.      Bank of America aroused the ire of some investors last year when it named Chief Executive Brian Moynihan as its chairman, undoing a 2009 investor vote to separate the jobs. The vote next week came in response to shareholder complaints. To Kovacevich, the 2009 shareholder vote at Bank of America to separate the chairman and CEO spots is not important anymore. ""What somebody thought then is totally irrelevant,"" he said. Bank of America declined comment.The Bank of America vote is expected to be close. Large investors including pension funds in California and New York City have said they will vote to separate the two roles.Kovacevich said that the 30 percent of votes that he did not win were typically from shareholders that took their cues from proxy advisory firms, including Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis. Among those votes were exchange-traded funds and other passive investors that essentially outsource decision making on these matters to proxy advisors.""ETFs don't want to spend the money,"" Kovacevich said. ""But saving money shouldn't dictate how people vote. It's undemocratic.""J.P. Morgan CEO and Chairman Jamie Dimon in May made similar comments, calling investors who vote based on ISS or Glass Lewis ""irresponsible"" and ""lazy.""

Bank of America's third-quarter trading revenue may fall between 5 percent and 6 percent due to weakness in its fixed income business, Chief Executive Brian Moynihan said at a conference less than two weeks ago. Moynihan, known within the bank as a problem-fixer and a cost-cutter, had previously said the trading business would need to trim expenses if results did not improve.Bond trading has been under pressure since the financial crisis as new rules discourage banks from trading off their own balance sheet and regulators demand that banks boost capital. Recent concerns over the slowing Chinese economy and the Greek debt crisis are expected to further cut into banks' trading volumes.During the second quarter, bond trading revenue at every major bank, with the exception of Morgan Stanley, declined from a year earlier.

523,"   By Jed Horowitz | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Bank of America Corp said its wealth management business' income plunged 19 percent in the third quarter, underscoring how stock market selloffs can torpedo even an area that banks see as relatively safe and stable.          The bank said that with the U.S. stock market falling during the quarter, many clients shrank from trading, cutting the brokerage unit's commission revenue. There were also fewer initial public offerings and sales of new mutual funds to help generate commission income. The value of client accounts also fell, which reduced its revenue from clients that pay a percentage of their brokerage assets as a fee. ""When market activity is lower, we tend to see less activity in the transactional side of that business,"" said Chief Financial Officer Paul Donofrio, speaking on a conference call with analysts. The lower revenue helped cut net income in the bank's wealth and investment management unit, which includes its Merrill Lynch brokerage business, to $656 million in the most recent quarter from $812 million in the year-ago quarter.  Banks across Wall Street, including Morgan Stanley, which reports its results on Monday, have been investing in their wealth management businesses, which can provide more stable revenue than their trading arms. The Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 7 percent during the third quarter, including an 11 percent drop during one week in August. When revenue declines at brokerage businesses, profit can fall much more because wealth management has high fixed costs. Bank of America's wealth management revenue fell 4.2 percent, which triggered the 19 percent profit drop. At least some of those fixed costs come from recruiting experienced new brokers, who can increase the bank's future revenue by bringing clients with them. Experienced brokers usually demand guaranteed bonuses to switch firms. BofA Chief Executive Brian Moynihan said he is not interested in slowing down on recruitment to cut costs for now.""We still believe the right trade is to continue to invest in growth,"" Moynihan said on the conference call. Merrill Lynch had 14,563 advisors at the end of the quarter, up 193 from the second quarter.""At the end of the day, if they're adding to that business they are going to have some profit hits during problematic markets,"" said George Pearkes, an analyst at Bespoke Investment Group, an asset management firm in Harrison, New York.

524,"   By Sweta Singh  Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) reported a profit for the third quarter, compared with a year-earlier loss, as Chief Executive Brian Moynihan's cost-cutting efforts helped the bank mitigate the impact of weak revenue in three of its four main businesses.BofA has been slashing billions of dollars in costs in its commercial lending, investment banking and wealth management businesses as overnight fund rates remain near zero and worries about China's economy and uncertainty over the timing of a U.S. rate hike prevent traders from making big bets.Shares of the No.2 U.S. bank by assets rose as much as 2.6 percent in morning trading on Wednesday. The bank's non-interest expenses fell by a third to $13.81 billion, mainly due to an 83 percent drop in costs in its legacy assets and servicing unit, which houses many of the bad loans inherited from Countrywide Financial.Consumer banking was BofA's only business to report a rise in revenue as the lender restructured its branch network, grew active accounts and issued more credit cards.""We continue to make good progress in a tough revenue environment due to low interest rates and a sluggish economic recovery,"" Moynihan, who won the backing of shareholders last month to remain chairman, said on a conference call.""The late summer's volatility, especially in the fixed income trading markets, (remains) challenging,"" Moynihan said.BofA is seen as the most sensitive to interest rate changes among the big U.S. banks. Deutsche Bank analyst Matt O'Connor wrote in a note this month that BofA's 2016 earnings would be 7.1 percent lower than his current estimates if interest rates don't rise. In contrast, Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) earnings would be 3.6 percent below his current estimates.  Wells Fargo, the biggest U.S. residential mortgage lender, reported a rise in profit for the first time in three quarters on Wednesday, helped by its purchase of commercial loans from General Electric Co.REVENUE DROPS BofA's total revenue fell 2.4 percent to $20.91 billion on a fully taxable equivalent basis in the quarter ended Sept. 30, but beat the average analyst estimate of $20.77 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.""Although revenues declined modestly in a tough operating environment, BofA made another solid step forward in maintaining the stability and predictability of its earnings by holding costs flat, improving credit, and further strengthening its capital position,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Joe Morford said in a note. Net interest income declined 6.7 percent to $9.74 billion on a fully taxable equivalent basis, while bond trading revenue fell 10.9 percent to $2 billion.JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) also reported a fall in quarterly bond trading revenue on Tuesday and warned that market expectations for the current quarter appeared to be too high in light of slow market trading.Excluding litigation costs, expenses fell 4 percent as the bank cut jobs and restructured.BofA said its headcount fell 6 percent from a year earlier.  Moynihan, who took the top job in 2010, shook up the bank's management in July, replacing Chief Financial Officer Bruce Thompson with longtime executive Paul Donofrio.BofA, which has paid more than $70 billion in legal expenses since 2008, said its legal costs fell for the third straight quarter, dropping to $231 million from $6 billion a year earlier.BofA's non-interest income, which includes mortgage banking, rose 1.6 percent to $11.17 billion.Provision for credit losses increased 26.7 percent to $806 million.BofA reported net income of $4.07 billion, or 37 cents per share, attributable to shareholders. Analysts on average had expected earnings of 33 cents per share.

526,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, October 14 (Fitch) While Bank of America Corporation's (BAC) reported  third quarter 2015 (3Q15) returns are below Fitch Ratings' estimate of the  long-term cost of equity assumption for the company, they represent a good base  from which BAC can continue to work to improve.  The reported net income of $4.51 billion was down from $5.32 billion in the  sequential quarter, but up from a loss in the year ago quarter which was marred  by settlement charges with the Department of Justice (DOJ). These results  equated to a 0.84% return on ending assets (ROA) and a 7.05% return on ending  total equity (ROE) in 3Q15.  Fitch calculated pre-tax profits, which exclude DVA/CVA adjustments and various  other gains/losses, amounted to $5.3 billion or a 0.98% adjusted pre-tax return  on ending assets. While this result is below the linked quarter's Fitch  calculated ROA of 1.35%, it is better than the results posted in the first  quarter of 2015 (0.88% ROA) and the fourth quarter of 2014 (0.91% ROA). As  noted, the prior year's quarter included a loss due to a significant settlement. Given a somewhat challenging revenue environment, BAC's earnings performance  benefited from management's continued efforts to trim down expenses in both core  and legacy operations. BAC's total revenue was down 6.49% from the linked quarter, and 2.48% from the  year-ago quarter. It is noteworthy that the revenue decline was cushioned by  approximately $400 million of gains on consumer real estate sold as well as $385  million of gains on debt securities sold partially offset by a charge of $305  million related to PPI claims in the United Kingdom. Reported net interest income was down from the linked quarter and essentially  flat from the year-ago quarter, as the reported net interest yield remained low  amid the challenging interest rate environment. Non-interest income was more mixed, but down from the linked quarter and up  modestly from the year-ago quarter. In particular revenue in the Global Wealth &  Investment Management segment was down as was revenue in the Global Markets  segment for both periods. However, despite the challenging revenue environment BAC continued to streamline  its operations with good expense management. Expenses slightly declined relative  to the linked quarter and substantially from the year-ago quarter which included  significant litigation and settlement costs. Much of this good expense management was a result of continued expense reduction  in the Legacy Assets and Services segment as well as continued efforts to  optimize the cost structure in the company's core businesses. BAC's asset quality metrics continue to be good. Provision expense ticked up due  to some loan growth in the Global Banking Segment as well as some credit  migration in certain Oil & Gas related loans. However, in Fitch's opinion, net  charge offs (NCOs) remain low and near a cyclical low. As such, provision was  less than NCO's by $126 million, which also helped to support the company's  earnings. In Fitch's view, BAC's liquidity position remains sound with total deposits of  $1.2 trillion and a Time to Required Funding of 42 months, up from 40 months in  the linked quarter and 38 months in the year-ago quarter. BAC's Basel III fully phased-in Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio improved under  both the standardized and advanced approaches. Under the standardized approach  BAC's fully phased-in CET1 ratio was 10.8% and under the pro forma advanced  approach was 9.7%. Given that this pro forma advanced approach ratio is the  lower of the two, it will beBAC's binding constraint. While Fitch notes that this CET1 ratio is below the average of some peer  institutions, the denominator of the ratio does include a sizeable component of  operational risk weighted assets (RWA). Additionally, BAC is in compliance with the Enhanced Supplementary Leverage  Ratio (SLR) at both the bank and parent company.

531,"   By Sujata Rao | LONDON  LONDON Oct 16 Investors betting on a delay to U.S. policy tightening put new money into emerging equity and bonds funds for the first time in at least three months, while global stocks saw the first inflow in four weeks, Bank of America/Merrill Lynch said on Friday.Data from BAML, which also includes figures from Boston-based fund tracker EPFR Global, showed equities and bonds had both received inflows in the week to Oct 14. While demand grew for riskier junk-rated and emerging debt, government and Treasury bond funds saw small outflows, the first in 15 weeks.""EM is back...The collapse in Fed hike expectations gave oversold junk a bid,"" BAML said, noting this was the first sign of rotation to ""weak dollar"" plays such as commodities, emerging markets, and industrial stocks.Weak U.S. jobs data increased chances that the U.S. Federal Reserve would not raise rates in December and minutes of its last meeting reinforced this, sparking a rally in emerging assets and stocks and driving a dollar index to six-week lows. BAML said global equity funds had received $2.6 billion, the first inflow in four weeks while bond inflows of $3.8 billion were the largest in 12 weeks.Emerging equity funds which have shed around $60 billion year-to-date, enjoyed their first inflows in 14 weeks, albeit just $700 million, while emerging debt received $400 million, the first inflow in 12 weeks, the report said.Chinese equity fund inflows hit a 14-week high, according to EPFR. ""Although the recent run of outflows from EM equity funds has arguably pushed into excess territory, and is hence sending a contrarian 'buy' signal, it is the more benign interpretation of China's growth trajectory that is having the biggest impact on flows,"" EPFR Global said in a separate note.U.S. equities, another category that has suffered this year from Fed hike expectations, took in $700 million, though this was down to exchange traded funds (ETFs) with mutual funds continuing to see losses. European stocks continued their run of gains, with $3.1 billion in inflows, but Japanese equity funds lost another $1.6 billion, adding to the previous week's $2 billion outflow.Investors also returned in force to lower-grade debt, which BAML termed ""junk-on"". Dedicated high-yield, or junk, bond funds absorbed $2.6 billion, the largest in eight months, it said.Money market funds, a proxy for cash, took in $5 billion, a fraction of the $53 billion received during the previous week .(Reporting by Sujata Rao; Editing by Keith Weir)",2015-10-16,BAC,"Fri Oct 16, 2015 | 6:28am EDT",Cash flows to emerging market funds for first time in 3 mths-BAML,http://www.reuters.com//article/investment-flow-baml-idUSL8N12G1PY20151016?type=companyNews

533,"   By Trevor Hunnicutt | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Bank of America Corp, the No. 2 U.S. bank, has agreed to sell its $87 billion money-market fund business to BlackRock Inc in one of the cash-management industry's largest deals ever.The transaction comes as big banks have faced pressure to simplify their businesses since the global financial crisis and marks the largest in a series of deals reshuffling the cash-management industry before costly regulatory reforms take effect in 2016.Terms of the transaction were not disclosed. The agreement is expected to lift BlackRock's global cash-management business to $372 billion from about $285 billion, according to the New York-based company.BlackRock, a manager of mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, private equity pools and other investment products, is already the world's largest money manager with $4.5 trillion in assets.""Combining our business together with the Bank of America assets and distribution puts us in a unique competitive position,"" said Tom Callahan, co-head of global cash management at BlackRock, in an interview.""It's a challenge managing cash in a low interest-rate environment, so we have to be highly efficient.""BlackRock's heft is partly the result of similar acquisitions, including Merrill Lynch's investment management business in 2006. Merrill was later acquired by Bank of America and remains a major distributor of BlackRock products to individual investors and institutions. ""This transaction is consistent with Bank of America’s ongoing efforts to simplify its business, in this instance, by outsourcing certain product manufacturing functions to an industry leader,"" said Bank of America spokeswoman Susan McCabe. She added that the bank will focus on distributing money market funds from BlackRock and other third-party providers.The profitability of money-market funds, which invest in relatively low-risk corporate and government debt that can be paid back within days or weeks, has been hemmed in by U.S. interest rates hovering near zero.Mergers and acquisitions trimmed the money funds industry from 75 providers in the United States last summer to just 67 this year, according to Crane Data, an industry research service. Once the deal closes next year, BlackRock will leapfrog JPMorgan Chase & Co to become the second largest money fund family, behind Fidelity Investments, according to Peter Crane of the research service.The $2.7 trillion industry has lost some $30 billion in revenue since 2009, according to trade group Investment Company Institute, after slashing fees to prevent investors from losing money in an era of rock-bottom interest rates.

534,"  (Adds background, quotes from analyst and BlackRock)By Trevor HunnicuttNEW YORK Nov 3 Bank of America Corp, the No. 2 U.S. bank, has agreed to sell its $87 billion money-market fund business to BlackRock Inc in one of the cash-management industry's largest deals ever.The transaction comes as big banks have faced pressure to simplify their businesses since the global financial crisis and marks the largest in a series of deals reshuffling the cash-management industry before costly regulatory reforms take effect in 2016.Terms of the transaction were not disclosed. The agreement is expected to lift BlackRock's global cash-management business to $372 billion from about $285 billion, according to the New York-based company.BlackRock, a manager of mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, private equity pools and other investment products, is already the world's largest money manager with $4.5 trillion in assets.""Combining our business together with the Bank of America assets and distribution puts us in a unique competitive position,"" said Tom Callahan, co-head of global cash management at BlackRock, in an interview. ""It's a challenge managing cash in a low interest-rate environment, so we have to be highly efficient.""BlackRock's heft is partly the result of similar acquisitions, including Merrill Lynch's investment management business in 2006. Merrill was later acquired by Bank of America and remains a major distributor of BlackRock products to individual investors and institutions.""This transaction is consistent with Bank of America's ongoing efforts to simplify its business, in this instance, by outsourcing certain product manufacturing functions to an industry leader,"" said Bank of America spokeswoman Susan McCabe. She added that the bank will focus on distributing money market funds from BlackRock and other third-party providers.The profitability of money-market funds, which invest in relatively low-risk corporate and government debt that can be paid back within days or weeks, has been hemmed in by U.S. interest rates hovering near zero. Mergers and acquisitions trimmed the money funds industry from 75 providers in the United States last summer to just 67 this year, according to Crane Data, an industry research service.Once the deal closes next year, BlackRock will leapfrog JPMorgan Chase & Co to become the second largest money fund family, behind Fidelity Investments, according to Peter Crane of the research service.The $2.7 trillion industry has lost some $30 billion in revenue since 2009, according to trade group Investment Company Institute, after slashing fees to prevent investors from losing money in an era of rock-bottom interest rates.

540,"  (Updates throughout)LUANDA Nov 26 Bank of America will stop supplying U.S. dollars to Angola at the end of this month, two foreign exchange sources said on Thursday, a move that could pile pressure on the oil exporter's ailing kwanza  currency.South Africa's Rand Merchant Bank (RMB) said on Thursday that a U.S. bank had decided to discontinue providing it with dollars for onward supply to Angola which meant it would stop selling Angolan banks the greenback from Nov. 30. RMB, a division of FirstRand Bank Ltd, did not name the U.S. bank or say why it no longer wished to trade dollars with Angola. Bank of America, the biggest supplier of dollars to Angola, declined to comment.Angola's kwanza has weakened around 30 percent officially this year and far more on the parallel market as subdued oil prices hit Africa's second largest crude exporter. Angola's central bank said on Nov. 5 that it would reduce the delivery of banknotes in foreign currency to travellers as well as limit withdrawals from foreign currency accounts as it sought to stem the kwanza's slide. In September, Angola's central bank devalued the kwanza by about 4 percent and tightened dollar liquidity after a devaluation of 6 percent in June. But the currency has continued to weaken and analysts are expecting a further devaluation soon.Former Portuguese colony Angola is an increasingly important market for global powers. The southern African country is a key oil supplier to China and sold its first Eurobond this month, raising $1.5 billion via a 10-year issue.

541,"  Dec 3 Standard & Poor's cut its nonoperating holding company (NOHC) ratings on eight U.S. ""global systemically important banks"" by one notch, citing uncertainty about the U.S. government's willingness to provide support to the banking system if it came under stress.The ratings apply to the holding companies of Bank of America Corp, Citigroup Inc, Morgan Stanley , Wells Fargo & Co, Bank of New York Mellon Corp , State Street Corp, JPMorgan Chase & Co  and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.The credit ratings on the banks' operating units are not affected by the downgrade. The Federal Reserve said last week that big U.S. banks would have an extra year to calculate a capital requirement known as the supplementary leverage ratio for stress tests. The supplementary leverage ratio creates hard limits on how much debt banks can borrow relative to their assets, without giving them credit for having relatively low-risk assets. In October, the Fed also proposed a rule that would require six of the eight banks to raise an additional $120 billion to comply with a regulatory requirement.The requirements are aimed at ensuring that the banks are able to recapitalize without disrupting markets or requiring a government bailout.

548,"  LONDON Royal Bank of Scotland could reach a settlement within weeks on claims it misled investors in selling U.S. mortgage-backed securities, passing another milestone in its recovery from the financial crisis, analysts said on Friday.U.S. authorities struck a $5.1 billion settlement with Goldman Sachs on Thursday, leaving British taxpayer-backed RBS as the only other major case involving mis-sold U.S. mortgage-backed bonds still to be resolved.Court documents filed in the United States in June suggested RBS could have to pay as much as $13 billion to settle the mortgage-backed securities claims, although some analysts' estimates are much lower.

Although costly, investors and analysts say a settlement would be a major step in RBS's recovery from financial crisis in 2007-2009, when it was rescued with a 46 billion pound ($65.75 billion) government bailout.

550,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, January 19 (Fitch) According to Fitch Ratings, the key to improved  earnings for Bank of America Corporation (BAC) over the near-term is a continued  focus on expense management. Overall expenses for BAC were down relative to the  year-ago quarter, and essentially flat from the sequential quarter.  However, Fitch expects BAC to continue to reduce expenses in its Legacy Assets &  Servicing segment, continue to optimize multiple delivery channels, as well as  continue to be judicious about its staffing levels, all of which it continued to  execute on during 2015.  Bank of America Corporation (BAC) reported fourth quarter 2015 (4Q15) net income  of $3.3 billion down from $4.3 billion in the sequential quarter but up from  $3.1 billion in the year-ago quarter. On a full-year basis, BAC reported net  income of $15.9 billion, up from $4.8 billion in the prior year, which was  significantly impacted by litigation charges related to legacy matters. BAC's 4Q15 results equated to a 0.61% annualized return on average assets (ROAA)  down from 0.79% in the sequential quarter but up slightly from 0.57% in the year  ago quarter. The company's 4Q15 annualized return on average equity (ROAE) was  5.08%, down from 6.65% in the sequential quarter, but up from 4.84% in the  year-ago quarter.  While these results are starting to stabilize in the absence of large litigation  charges, they still remain below the results of peers and Fitch Rating's  long-term cost of equity assumption for BAC and others of approximately 10%. Full-year returns were better with the company's 2015 ROAA coming in at 0.74% up  from 0.23% in the prior year, and its 2015 ROAE coming in at 6.26%, up from  1.70% in the prior year, which was marred by significant litigation charges.  Fitch calculated pre-tax profits, which exclude DVA adjustments and various  other gains/losses amounted to $4.9 billion, or a 0.92% adjusted pre-tax return  on ending assets. This result is down slightly from the sequential quarter, and  essentially unchanged from the year-ago quarter. BAC's total net revenue of $19.5bn was down slightly from the sequential  quarter, but up slightly from the year-ago quarter. Total net revenue in BAC's consumer banking segment was down $40 million from  the sequential quarter on higher net interest income (NII), but up $33 million  from the year ago quarter on lower non-interest income primarily within mortgage  banking. In BAC's Global Wealth & Investment Management segment, total revenue was down  from the  year-ago quarters in part due to lower transactional activity and  lower market valuations. Total net revenue in Global Banking was up relative to the sequential and  year-ago quarters primarily from higher NII due to increased deposit and loan  balances over the year. Additionally, investment banking fees were down due to  lower underwriting revenues, particularly within leveraged finance, partially  offset by higher advisory fees. Within Global Banking, BAC took some higher provisioning for loan losses due to  some incremental loan growth as well as the company's energy exposures. As of  4Q15 BAC's utilized energy exposure amounted to $21.3 billion, which  approximates 2% of the company's total loans and leases.  BAC notes that approximately 39% of the energy exposure noted above is  attributable to what it terms higher risk companies in exploration and  production and oil field services industries. Additionally, BAC notes that its  energy reservable criticized exposure increased to $4.7 billion, or 22% of the  energy portfolio, at 4Q15. Given the comparatively smaller size of BAC's energy exposure to the company's  overall balance sheet, Fitch believes this exposure to be manageable at this  juncture, though there may be some higher provisioning for these credits in the  coming quarters. In the Global Markets businesses, BAC's trading net revenue was up relative to  the year-ago quarter on better results in Fixed Income Currency, & Commodities  (FICC), though notably the prior year's quarter was a weak one for BAC. Relative  to the sequential quarter total revenue in Global Markets was down amid  challenging market conditions across the industry. In Fitch's view, BAC's liquidity position remains sound with total deposits of  $1.2 trillion and a Time to Required Funding (debt coverage at parent) of 39  months. BAC's Basel III fully phased-in Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio improved under  the advanced approaches to 9.8%. Given that the advanced approaches ratio is the  lower of the two, it remains BAC's binding constraint. While Fitch would note that this CET1 ratio is below the average of some peer  institutions, the denominator of the ratio does include a sizeable component of  operational risk weighted assets (RWA). Additionally, BAC is in compliance with the Enhanced Supplementary Leverage  Ratio (SLR) at both the bank and parent company.

554,"  LONDON Jan 27 Bonds worth around 25 billion euros are currently at risk of losing their investment grade credit ratings and joining the category known as ""Fallen Angels"", Bank of America/Merrill (BAML) said on Wednesday.But these bonds could prove a source of positive returns for investors, BAML said, noting that downgrades often unleashed buying interest from funds which invest in high-yield debt.BAML said high-grade debt worth 28 billion euros were rated  BBB or BBB-minus and carried either a negative outlook or were on negative watch, meaning they were at risk of junk status.BBB-minus is the lowest rating category above junk while negative outlook indicates the direction a rating may move over a one-to-two-year period. Negative Watches implies a downgrade is likely in the short term. ""The risk of Fallen Angels has yet again risen, both in Europe and in the United States, amid big depreciation of emerging market currencies, oil and commodity weakness, and concerns over global growth,"" BAML told clients.Industrials, followed by retailers and auto names, feature in the list, BAML said. While junk bonds, especially in the United States, are the epicentre of current market anxiety, BAML said the negative impact on Fallen Angels was far less than in previous years as more and more funds have expanded mandates to buy lower-rated debt.So spread-widening tends to happen when a bond is placed on negative watch while a cut to junk often results in a rally, BAML noted. ""On average, it took only 10 days for the rally to begin, post-downgrade, and the tightening tends to continue for another 2-3 months,"" the note said. ""Our work shows that high-yield investors should be quick to buy favoured Fallen Angels upon their downgrade to high-yield indices.""Due to several waves of euro crisis and new-found junk status for emerging issuers Brazil and Russia, Fallen Angels represent about a third of the euro high-yield market, BAML said, though this is down from a 55 percent peak in early-2009.On the flip side, ""Rising Angels"" - credits that look poised to make the transition to investment grade from junk - amount to only 8 billion euros, BAML added.

The 2015 figure includes a $14.5 million stock-based award, compared to $11.5 million for 2014. Consistent with previous years, Moynihan did not receive a cash bonus.

563,"   By Olivia Oran and Anjuli Davies | NEW YORK/LONDON  NEW YORK/LONDON When the U.S. Federal Reserve's newest policymaker Neel Kashkari dropped a bombshell with a call to break up big banks on Tuesday, it was met with a predictably indignant response from their lobbyists. One described his comments as ""blind.""     But while no one in the executive suites of major global banks would want authorities to force them to split up or downsize, many top bankers acknowledge that their institutions might be better off smaller and simpler. They just worry that any major restructuring could go all wrong because of the way post-financial crisis regulations are applied.    In interviews with Reuters, six senior bankers said they are struggling with the costs and restrictions they face as a result of new regulations, as well as a weak global economy and troubled financial markets. The bankers, who are or recently were in positions ranging from business division head to CEO, spoke on the condition of anonymity so they could be candid without upsetting regulators or investors.""Fundamentally, the business has to change,"" said one veteran banker who was on the executive committee of a major European bank until recently. Big banks' shareholder returns have sunk ""too low,"" he said.    These problems are not new, but they have fresh relevance as Deutsche Bank AG (DBKGn.DE) confronts questions about its capital adequacy, Barclays PLC (BARC.L) faces pressure to break up and CEOs of big U.S. banks struggle with a loss of investor confidence in their stocks. (For a graphic of U.S. banks' price-to-book ratios, see  reut.rs/1SG0NDL)Management teams in the U.S. and Europe are now taking a hard look at dramatic business model changes, but none of the options are particularly attractive, the bankers said.    Merging to cut costs and improve margins is out of the question, given the hurdles banks would likely face from regulators who do not want ""too-big-to-fail"" institutions getting any bigger. Splitting apart is complicated by capital requirements that would make standalone trading businesses economically unfeasible — and by the fact that there are few, if any, buyers for the assets banks want least.Some top bankers say they are left with little choice but to muddle through what they fear will be a long, dark period of weak earnings, angry shareholders and gradual shrinkage.The problem has gotten so bad that Deutsche Bank CEO John Cryan recently said on a public conference call that he'd much rather be CEO of a simpler, retail-focused bank like Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), which has only a modest investment banking operation.""Unfortunately,"" he said, ""there are lots of things I wish for that are not going to come true.""RATCHETING UP CAPITAL Kashkari's comments, in his first speech as head of the Minneapolis Fed, were surprising because he is a former Goldman Sachs banker, a Republican, and was a senior Treasury official in President George W. Bush's administration during the financial crisis. They partly echoed the stance of Bernie Sanders, who has also called for big bank breakups and criticized Hillary Clinton, his rival in the struggle to be the Democratic presidential candidate, for being too close to Wall Street. Some of those vying for the Republican nomination have also criticized regulations brought in after the crisis, saying they would repeal the Dodd-Frank reform law.    In an interview with Reuters on Wednesday, Kashkari criticized Dodd-Frank's so-called ""living will"" rule, which requires banks to show how they can be dismantled in an orderly way if they fail, without creating risk to the broader financial system. Kashkari said he believes the rule would not work in a crisis scenario – that banks would simply be bailed out again.""I challenge anybody who thinks, in a stressed time, we would put these banks through resolution,"" he said. ""I really don't think it will happen.""One way to force large financial firms to break up is to ""aggressively ratchet up"" their capital or leverage requirements, Kashkari said. He warned, though, that banks would likely fight hard against any such proposal.Indeed, Tony Fratto, who worked with Kashkari at the Treasury Department and is now a bank lobbyist at Hamilton Place Strategies, said his former colleague's comments were out of touch with reality.""This is something like re-opening the barn door after the horse is in the stable,"" Fratto said. ""Love or hate Dodd-Frank, it's simply blind to say that it hasn't significantly improved safety and soundness."" OUT OF ARROWS     Securities analysts and consultants say that banks are in an unenviable position because moves they might have made in the past to improve profitability have been hindered by regulation. As a result, they have struggled unsuccessfully for years to get their returns on equity above single digits.    ""In some ways, banks have become bad utilities,"" said Fred Cannon, a bank stock analyst with KBW. ""With utilities, you have strict regulation in what you can do and charge, but in the end investors get a reasonable return. With banks, that last piece hasn't happened.""    Bank executives have long argued that weak returns are a ""cyclical"" issue that should go away when markets begin to flourish again. But as the industry approaches the eighth anniversary of the financial crisis's nadir, questions about whether they face a secular rather than a cyclical profit problem have only grown louder. And top bankers are now wondering how they can possibly grow revenue under a sprawling set of global financial regulations that limit what they do, and sometimes conflict with one another. (For a graphic showing bank earnings and share price performance, see tmsnrt.rs/1mZb4h8)    One common example raised is how new capital rules can penalize banks for being big but also discourage them from getting smaller.    For instance, due to their size, the eight largest U.S. banks must collectively hold $200 billion in extra capital, which weighs on shareholder returns. Included in the capital requirement is a fixed amount each bank must hold to represent ""operational risk."" Although the Fed does not explain exactly how it comes up with that figure, it is not just a function of size: Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) must hold 25 percent more operational risk capital than JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), the biggest bank in the country.Bank of America has said it's taken steps to address the Fed's concerns by cutting back on certain revenue-producing activities that created operational risk. Nonetheless, the bank says it has so far been unable to persuade the Fed to reduce that capital requirement. Its shareholder returns suffer as a result, because revenue is dropping faster than capital costs.""Every bank is trying to figure out, with bigger capital requirements and profit pressure, how can they create acceptable returns for their shareholders,"" said John Weisel, an Ernst & Young executive who advises global banks on business strategy.    After years of cost-cutting, he said, CEOs are asking themselves: ""We've used all the arrows in our quiver, so what are we going to do next?""BREAK-UP DEMANDS     European banks are behind their U.S. competitors in addressing a more regulated environment and, in some cases, are flailing around for answers.Last week, Deutsche Bank shares hit an all-time low on worries that it won't be able to buy back some bonds that can convert into equity. Deutsche regained some value after it outlined plans to repurchase $5.38 billion worth of other bonds, but investors' concerns don't seem to have been entirely assuaged.    Meanwhile, Barclays has come under pressure after a Bernstein analyst wrote an open letter on Feb. 5 imploring CEO Jes Staley to break up the bank.    Rob McDonough, who advises financial institutions on risk management at Angel Oak Consulting Group, says megabanks may have little choice but to get significantly smaller.    ""It's too expensive,"" he said, ""for banks to be big.""

573,"  (Repeating story sent earlier to additional subscribers)By Dan FreedMarch 3 Bank of America is making a big push into auto lending just as regulators are sending warning signals, losses from auto loans are rising, and rivals are growing more cautious after years of strong returns.The bank tapped mortgage executives Matt Vernon and John Schleck to lead the auto lending business last May, saying they would be able to sell auto loans alongside other products such as checking accounts and home equity loans.In interviews, the executives and their boss, D. Steve Boland, who oversees a broad swath of consumer lending, said they still see room for growth from borrowers who have good credit. They have hired extensively in recent months, adding dozens of loan officers and salespeople.But some competitors and bank analysts said hiring doesn't make sense at this stage, because auto sales may be close to peaking, and consumer credit is showing signs of weakness.Industry-wide, banks classified $1.1 billion worth of auto loans as uncollectible in the fourth quarter, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. That is up 15 percent from the year-ago period, and up 39 percent since the fourth quarter of 2011. Ultimately, much of that bad debt turns into losses for the banks.For a graphic showing auto loans that are 30-89 days past due and an auto sales projection, see tmsnrt.rs/24xv9vV""I'm not actively hiring or growing our operations across the platform. That's for sure,"" said Andrew Stuart, head of TD Auto Finance, which is slightly smaller than Bank of America's auto business.At a Feb. 10 conference, Capital One Financial Corp  CEO Richard Fairbank said that while auto loans provided ""once in a lifetime type returns"" after the financial crisis, the business has begun to lose strength. In a January interview on CNBC, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon called the market ""stretched.""Portales Partners analyst Charles Peabody said Bank of America is late to the auto loans party. But in its defense, he noted that the bank's Chief Executive Brian Moynihan and his management team were too busy trying to resolve mortgage-related issues when the auto lending business seemed like a smarter bet.""They should have been beefing this thing up two years ago, but two years ago Moynihan was still trying to stabilize the ship,"" Peabody said.SLOWING MOMENTUM  All banks are struggling to boost revenue during a period of stubbornly low interest rates and tough post-crisis regulation, but Bank of America has felt the pain more acutely than most of its peers.The second-largest U.S. bank by assets, Bank of America trades at just 50 percent of book value, compared to 90 percent for JP Morgan Chase & Co and 130 percent for Wells Fargo & Co. Bank of America took bigger losses than those rivals during the crisis, and still lags them by other key metrics, including return on equity and costs in relation to revenue.While Bank of America showed some progress in 2015, it still has to prove it can generate consistent performance under Moynihan, who took the helm in 2010. During his tenure, the bank has paid tens of billions of dollars in fines and settlements related to mortgages that were issued before he became CEO.Bank of America ranks 11th among U.S. auto lenders, with just 1.72 percent of the market in the third quarter of last year, according to the latest available data from Experian Automotive. Ally Financial Inc, the largest U.S. auto lender, accounts for 6 percent, followed by Wells Fargo, which ranked second with 5.57 percent. JPMorgan was fifth with 4.15 percent.Bank of America may rank higher on Thursday, when Experian says it will release fourth-quarter data, because Vernon said much of its growth came at the end of the year.Auto sales remain very robust. Figures carmakers released on Tuesday showed that sales climbed to a 15-year high for the month of February, driven by low gasoline prices, wage growth, and because loans are both available and cheap. But most forecasters expect sales to peak in 2016 and trend down over the next few years.""We remain in the 'plateau' camp,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Joseph Spak wrote on Tuesday, sticking to his flat sales forecast. Stocks have broadly declined in recent months over concerns about the global economy, and some companies that make money selling or financing vehicles have gotten hit even harder. They recovered some of those losses after the latest sales figures.Ford Motor Co and General Motors Co are down roughly 6 and 11 percent, respectively, since the beginning of the year, while publicly-traded auto lenders Santander Consumer  and Ally are down 35.7 percent and 2.8 percent, respectively. The S&P 500 Index has dropped 2.8 percent so far this year.Delinquencies on bonds comprised of subprime auto loans hit their highest level in six years, Fitch Ratings said last week. According to the FDIC, 1.82 percent of all auto loans were 30 to 89 days past due during the fourth quarter - the highest rate on record since the FDIC began keeping track in 2011.As weakness in the auto sector has become evident, regulators have begun to sound alarm bells.In a speech in October, U.S. Comptroller of the Currency Thomas Curry warned of risks from subprime auto loans, as well as loans that mature in six years or more, which tend to be issued to customers who can't afford monthly payments on loans with shorter durations. In November, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York issued a report on auto lending that showed a growing portion of loans being issued to consumers with poor credit. FOCUSED ON PRIME Bank of America says it is focused strictly on prime and ""superprime"" customers. The ""majority by far"" of its auto borrowers have credit scores higher than 700, Vernon said. Borrowers with credit scores above 660 are generally considered to have good credit.Still, a decline in used car values would lower recoveries on loans that go bad, and the longer the life of the loan the greater the exposure to such a risk. Bank of America will lend up to 75 months - slightly longer than the six years Comptroller Curry cited as a concern - though Vernon said the average maturity is far lower.The bank does not release granular data on its auto loan book, so it is hard to know how its borrowers' credit quality has held up over time. In data provided to Reuters, Bank of America said it made $23.7 billion in auto and recreational vehicle loans in 2015, up 41 percent from 2014.Most of that growth came through auto dealers, the area Vernon oversees, and much of it happened in the fourth quarter after he hired seven ""relationship managers"" whose job is to drum up business with dealerships around the country. Vernon is targeting 5-10 percent growth for his operation in 2016.Schleck, who oversees the business that works directly with retail customers, has also been staffing up - nearly doubling the number of loan officers to 110 from 60 since last May. Although Schleck said he is unlikely to continue growing staff at that pace, he may hire more this year if demand warrants. Likewise, if demand cools, Schleck said he is prepared to reduce staff.""I needed to get to a certain level to be able to provide a certain level of service and I needed to get there very quickly-and did,"" he said. ""Prior to May there was probably a lot of lost opportunity, whereas after May, I'm capturing what maybe we could have captured earlier.""Boland, their boss, said it's true that Bank of America was ""in a different place in 2012,"" but disputed the idea that the bank is too late to build up its  auto loans business.""I don't feel like I'm late at all,"" he said. ""There's not a timing issue to it. I'm going to continue to focus on growing across our consumer lending.""As long as the bank is cautious about borrowers and keeps staffing in line with demand, it can grow just by selling to more of its existing customers, Boland added.Patrick Kaser, portfolio manager at Brandywine Asset Management, which owns about 26 million Bank of America shares, said the bank's strategy is sensible even if it comes at a less-than-optimal time. The bank pulled back ""far too much"" from certain businesses after the shock of its mortgage losses and fines, and re-entering the market with a focus on healthy consumers makes sense, he said.""Only time will tell if they're entering at the peak and whether or not they'll be too aggressive,"" said Kaser, ""but the banks have a lot of incentive to show discipline.""(Reporting by Dan Freed; Editing by Lauren Tara LaCapra and Martin Howell)",2016-03-03,BAC,"Thu Mar 3, 2016 | 7:00am EST",RPT-Bank of America revs up auto loans business despite warning signs,http://www.reuters.com//article/bank-of-america-auto-loans-idUSL2N16B03F?type=companyNews

During his tenure, the bank has paid tens of billions of dollars in fines and settlements related to mortgages that were issued before he became CEO.Bank of America ranks 11th among U.S. auto lenders, with just 1.72 percent of the market in the third quarter of last year, according to the latest available data from Experian Automotive. Ally Financial Inc, the largest U.S. auto lender, accounts for 6 percent, followed by Wells Fargo, which ranked second with 5.57 percent. JPMorgan was fifth with 4.15 percent.Bank of America may rank higher on Thursday, when Experian says it will release fourth-quarter data, because Vernon said much of its growth came at the end of the year.Auto sales remain very robust. Figures carmakers released on Tuesday showed that sales climbed to a 15-year high for the month of February, driven by low gasoline prices, wage growth, and because loans are both available and cheap. But most forecasters expect sales to peak in 2016 and trend down over the next few years.""We remain in the 'plateau' camp,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Joseph Spak wrote on Tuesday, sticking to his flat sales forecast. Stocks have broadly declined in recent months over concerns about the global economy, and some companies that make money selling or financing vehicles have gotten hit even harder. They recovered some of those losses after the latest sales figures.Ford Motor Co and General Motors Co are down roughly 6 and 11 percent, respectively, since the beginning of the year, while publicly-traded auto lenders Santander Consumer  and Ally are down 35.7 percent and 2.8 percent, respectively. The S&P 500 Index has dropped 2.8 percent so far this year.Delinquencies on bonds comprised of subprime auto loans hit their highest level in six years, Fitch Ratings said last week. According to the FDIC, 1.82 percent of all auto loans were 30 to 89 days past due during the fourth quarter - the highest rate on record since the FDIC began keeping track in 2011.As weakness in the auto sector has become evident, regulators have begun to sound alarm bells.In a speech in October, U.S. Comptroller of the Currency Thomas Curry warned of risks from subprime auto loans, as well as loans that mature in six years or more, which tend to be issued to customers who can't afford monthly payments on loans with shorter durations. In November, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York issued a report on auto lending that showed a growing portion of loans being issued to consumers with poor credit.FOCUSED ON PRIME  Bank of America says it is focused strictly on prime and ""superprime"" customers. The ""majority by far"" of its auto borrowers have credit scores higher than 700, Vernon said. Borrowers with credit scores above 660 are generally considered to have good credit.Still, a decline in used car values would lower recoveries on loans that go bad, and the longer the life of the loan the greater the exposure to such a risk. Bank of America will lend up to 75 months - slightly longer than the six years Comptroller Curry cited as a concern - though Vernon said the average maturity is far lower.The bank does not release granular data on its auto loan book, so it is hard to know how its borrowers' credit quality has held up over time. In data provided to Reuters, Bank of America said it made $23.7 billion in auto and recreational vehicle loans in 2015, up 41 percent from 2014.Most of that growth came through auto dealers, the area Vernon oversees, and much of it happened in the fourth quarter after he hired seven ""relationship managers"" whose job is to drum up business with dealerships around the country. Vernon is targeting 5-10 percent growth for his operation in 2016.Schleck, who oversees the business that works directly with retail customers, has also been staffing up - nearly doubling the number of loan officers to 110 from 60 since last May. Although Schleck said he is unlikely to continue growing staff at that pace, he may hire more this year if demand warrants. Likewise, if demand cools, Schleck said he is prepared to reduce staff.""I needed to get to a certain level to be able to provide a certain level of service and I needed to get there very quickly-and did,"" he said.

575,"   By Dan Freed   (This version of the March 3 story corrects paragraph 33 to indicate that Patrick Kaser is a portfolio manager at Brandywine Global Investment Management, not Brandywine Asset Management)By Dan FreedBank of America (BAC.N) is making a big push into auto lending just as regulators are sending warning signals, losses from auto loans are rising, and rivals are growing more cautious after years of strong returns.The bank tapped mortgage executives Matt Vernon and John Schleck to lead the auto lending business last May, saying they would be able to sell auto loans alongside other products such as checking accounts and home equity loans.In interviews, the executives and their boss, D. Steve Boland, who oversees a broad swath of consumer lending, said they still see room for growth from borrowers who have good credit. They have hired extensively in recent months, adding dozens of loan officers and salespeople.But some competitors and bank analysts said hiring doesn't make sense at this stage, because auto sales may be close to peaking, and consumer credit is showing signs of weakness.Industry-wide, banks classified $1.1 billion worth of auto loans as uncollectible in the fourth quarter, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. That is up 15 percent from the year-ago period, and up 39 percent since the fourth quarter of 2011. Ultimately, much of that bad debt turns into losses for the banks.For a graphic showing auto loans that are 30-89 days past due and an auto sales projection, see tmsnrt.rs/24xv9vV ""I'm not actively hiring or growing our operations across the platform. That's for sure,"" said Andrew Stuart, head of TD Auto Finance, which is slightly smaller than Bank of America's auto business.At a Feb. 10 conference, Capital One Financial Corp (COF.N) CEO Richard Fairbank said that while auto loans provided ""once in a lifetime type returns"" after the financial crisis, the business has begun to lose strength. In a January interview on CNBC, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon called the market ""stretched.""Portales Partners analyst Charles Peabody said Bank of America is late to the auto loans party. But in its defense, he noted that the bank's Chief Executive Brian Moynihan and his management team were too busy trying to resolve mortgage-related issues when the auto lending business seemed like a smarter bet.""They should have been beefing this thing up two years ago, but two years ago Moynihan was still trying to stabilize the ship,"" Peabody said.SLOWING MOMENTUM  All banks are struggling to boost revenue during a period of stubbornly low interest rates and tough post-crisis regulation, but Bank of America has felt the pain more acutely than most of its peers.The second-largest U.S. bank by assets, Bank of America trades at just 50 percent of book value, compared to 90 percent for JP Morgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) and 130 percent for Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N).

576,"   By Patrick Graham | LONDON  LONDON Symphony, the WhatsApp for the financial world, will significantly increase its user base this year at major institutions including a top asset manager, shareholder Goldman Sachs (GS.N) said on Monday.Google (GOOGL.O) and 18 of the world's biggest banks and fund managers have invested around $170 million in Symphony,  touted as a rival to the Instant Bloomberg messaging system and Thomson Reuters' (TRI.TO) Eikon Messenger, which link traders across the main global financial markets.""On Symphony, we are already deploying it a lot internally, so are other banks,"" Goldman Managing Director Bobby Vedral told an industry meeting in London. ""There is one big asset manager who will soon start to make it compulsory for interacting with them. It will certainly be used in a widespread way within the year."" Asked about Vedral's comments, Symphony declined to name the asset manager involved. ""We are rolling out with a number of clients but we're not ready to give details on user data or numbers at this time,"" a spokesman for the Palo Alto-based company said.Symphony says it has amassed 75,000 users on the platform,  which emerged after a row between some banks and Bloomberg over the use of client information by its journalists. The system allows financial firms, corporate customers and individuals to put all their digital communications - chats, texts, tweets and emails - on one centralized platform, aimed at creating a flexible and secure messaging service.But there are no publicly available details on when its shareholder institutions, who will also form the bulk of its initial paying customer base, will come on line.  Several banking sources told Reuters that internal usage at their institutions was growing. They said the system had successfully overcome internal barriers of regulatory compliance, development and budgets.The acid test, though, will be how far banks and asset managers will be willing to dump existing alternatives and use Symphony to communicate with each other and with clients.A spokesman for Goldman said roughly half of the bank's 38,000-strong workforce was already on the system, but not yet using it to talk to external users. An official from another of the world's top 10 banks by market capitalization, also a Symphony shareholder, said: ""We are probably slightly behind some of the other banks but this month about 150 employees will be starting to use it. Then it will be expanded to include further numbers.""The source added: ""With us it will definitely be thousands by the end of the year. From what I hear, the other banks are in a similar position.""Symphony's original group of investors - 15 banks and asset managers including Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), Citigroup Inc (C.N), JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), Citadel and Blackrock BLK.Q - alone represent a pool of around 1.6 million potential users.UBS Group AG UBSG.VX, French banks Natixis SA (CNAT.PA) and Societe Generale (SOGN.PA) and European venture capital firm Lakestar also signed up in a second round of funding last year.

578,"   By Olivia Oran and Dan Freed  Bank of America Corp is hiring a new team of investment bankers who cater to midsized companies, four years after dismantling a similar business, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters.    The precise number of middle-market bankers it plans to add could not be determined, but one person said it would be fewer than 10.    The hiring comes as Bank of America is reducing staff more broadly, while also trying to grow in areas where it believes it can gain market share.    As the second-biggest U.S. lender with a large commercial banking business, executives believe Bank of America can make inroads in advising midsized companies on mergers and stock and bond offerings, the sources said. Bank of America defines middle-market as companies with $50 million to $2 billion in revenue.The bank also hopes the push will lead to additional business such as managing money for executives at midsized companies.     Sources asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to speak to the media about matters that have not been made public.    Bank of America announced internally last year that Vice Chairman Mark Stephanz would create a group that provides investment banking services to midsized companies. The hiring is part of that effort. His team will work together with counterparts in the commercial bank who provide traditional loans and cash management services, sources said.      The Charlotte, North Carolina-based lender previously launched a middle-market business in 2007, with more than 30 investment bankers who focused on mergers and acquisitions. It abandoned the effort in 2012 to focus on larger clients and bigger deals, sources said.     In 2015, Bank of America ranked fourth in global M&A league tables, according to Thomson Reuters data. It ranked 23rd globally in deals worth $500 million or less.    Bank of America generated around 17 percent of its M&A fees from middle market deals, the lowest percentage of any big Wall Street bank except Goldman Sachs Group Inc.    Last year, M&A hit a record volume of nearly $5 trillion, due to mega deals like Anheuser-Busch Inbev SA's $106 billion acquisition of SABMiller Plc and oil company Royal Dutch Shell Plc's $70 billion purchase of BG Group Plc.    But some Wall Street executives predict blockbuster deals will slow down this year. In January, JPMorgan Chase & Co Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said she expects to see fewer massive mergers and more mid-sized deals.      Bank of America has been hiring salespeople to drum up business, even as it has cut support staff and underperformers as part of a multiyear cost-cutting initiative. Last year alone, it cut more than 10,000 jobs.    The bank laid off a number of investment bankers on Tuesday because of weak markets, one of the sources said.

Holbourn was previously UKFI's head of capital markets.James Leigh-Pemberton, who was executive chairman, has been appointed UKFI chairman.UKFI is charged with balancing the timing of selling off the government holdings in the banks to raise money to help to reduce Britain's budget deficit, while ensuring the best return for taxpayers. The government pumped a combined 66 billion pounds ($94.95 billion) into Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group to keep them afloat during the 2008-2009 financial crisis. ""We have an outstanding team here and I look forward to working with them and our investee companies in my new position to continue to deliver good results for the taxpayer,"" Holbourn said in a statement.The government could lose some 17.5 billion pounds, or a quarter of the money spent rescuing the banks, according to an analysis by the Treasury's independent forecasters this month. The Treasury estimated it might take another five years for the government to sell off its remaining 73 percent stake in Royal Bank of Scotland as the shares are trading at about half  their break-even price.The government is closer to returning Lloyds to the private sector, but had to defer plans to sell its remaining holding of less than 10 percent earlier this year due to financial market turmoil.

603,"   By Dan Freed  Five large U.S. banks cut more than $5 billion from their expenses during the first three months of the year, but it was still not enough to stop the financial bleeding in what was by many measures the worst quarter for Wall Street since the financial crisis.Volatile stock and bond markets, a rout in energy prices and stubbornly low interest rates left big banks' earnings in the dumps. As they reviewed results over the past week, some bank executives said conditions have improved in the early days of the second quarter, but there was little optimism that 2016 will be a year to celebrate.Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Morgan Stanley, whose earnings are more reliant on markets than peers, both saw their profits drop by more than half. Their returns on equity of around 6 percent were well below what investors and analysts say is acceptable.""They're not cutting costs fast enough to keep ahead of revenue declines,"" said Paul Miller, FBR Capital Markets. He cited revenue pressures on businesses including asset management and equity and fixed-income trading, and noted, ""All those things are coming down and the banks' infrastructure is unable to adjust those costs fast enough.""Almost all of the biggest U.S. banks are in the process of executing multibillion-dollar cost-cutting programs that were announced months or years ago, such as Morgan Stanley's Project Streamline or Bank of America Corp's New BAC plan.Others already completed such initiatives and are trying to be more efficient around the edges by restricting unnecessary travel or freezing new hires in certain markets. Yet JPMorgan Chase & Co was the only one that managed to reduce its expenses more than revenue declined versus a year ago. Wells Fargo & Co was the only bank to report higher expenses, but it was also alone in revenue growth, with both rising 4 percent. Wells is the least reliant on Wall Street businesses out of the big six banks.JPMorgan, Bank of America, Citigroup Inc, Goldman and Morgan Stanley reduced costs by $5.3 billion, or by 10 percent compared with the year-ago period. The latter four banks reduced headcount by 7,836 employees during the quarter, while JPMorgan and Wells increased staff levels. Pressure may build on banks to cut staff and costs further if markets do not improve. Analysts peppered management teams with questions about their expense levels on conference calls, and some executives acknowledged further steps may need to be taken.""If indeed the environment continued as is, we would be much more aggressive on the cost front,"" said Morgan Stanley Chief Executive James Gorman.Citigroup's finance chief, John Gerspach, said the bank is actively cutting back staff and assets in areas where management believes business will not return.At Goldman, which slashed compensation per employee by 44 percent, Chief Financial Officer Harvey Schwartz stopped short of promising the bank would embark on any kind of sweeping cost-cutting initiatives, but said it can always ""operate more efficiently."" Goldman cut its overall expenses by 29 percent last quarter compared with the same period a year earlier, but its revenue declined an even sharper 40 percent.Drastic cost cuts at Morgan Stanley and Citigroup Inc also fell short of big revenue declines posted by both companies. However, Citigroup said $491 million in charges it took to reposition its businesses, including severance payments, will help lower costs over the long term.Although the cost cuts mostly fell short, several analysts who spoke to Reuters said they were satisfied with what banks had done, given the extreme circumstances they were dealing with.Jeff Harte, a bank analyst with Sandler O'Neill, said he was encouraged by banks' ability to bring expenses lower. However, ""that's partially a function of not as great a revenue outlook. So it's nice, but then again, it's maybe not so nice.""

606,"  Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) shareholders elected all 13 directors nominated by the bank at its annual meeting on Wednesday, while approving compensation for top executives in a non-binding decision.Shareholders rejected an investor proposal tied to ""clawing back"" executive pay. The proposal would have required Bank of America to hold onto a ""substantial portion"" of executive officers' pay for at least 10 years to help pay for monetary damages incurred by the bank.Bank of America's board had recommended voting against the proposal, as had proxy advisory firms Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass, Lewis & Co.Investors also ratified PricewaterhouseCoopers as Bank of America's independent auditor. Among speakers at the meeting was CLSA bank analyst Mike Mayo, a frequent critic of the bank. Mayo said the bank's independent directors were not holding Chief Executive Brian Moynihan and his management team accountable when it came to setting time-specific financial targets. He also criticized the bank's executive pay proposal, calling it ""extra pay for management"". ""I don't see why the proxy, as overseen by the lead director, would allow management to get off so easily,"" he said.Mayo upgraded Bank of America to ""outperform"" from ""sell"" on Jan. 29, arguing in a report that the bank's low valuation and strong balance sheet make it attractive despite what he called ""poor governance and oversight."" The meeting was less eventful than last year, when shareholders complained loudly after the board unilaterally changed its bylaws to allow Moynihan to hold both the CEO and chairman roles, after investors had voted in 2009 to separate them. Bowing to the pressure, Bank of America held a vote on the issue in September, but shareholders upheld the board's decision.

614,"   By Olivia Oran  UBS Group AG's Americas wealth unit is partnering with online financial advisor SigFig Wealth Management to develop technology and investment tools for the Swiss bank, UBS said on Monday.    UBS said it has also bought an undisclosed stake in SigFig, a so-called robo-adviser which provides investment advice online at a lower cost than traditional brokerages which rely more heavily on human advisers.The firms will form a research lab to collaborate on new wealth management tools as part of the venture, UBS said in a press release.Wall Street banks and investment firms are increasingly building or buying robo-advisers to add business while cutting costs. Morgan Stanley and Bank of America Corp are building their own technologies, while BlackRock acquired FutureAdvisor last August. UBS has shifted its business model in recent years to focus more on wealth management, which is typically more stable than  businesses like trading. The Americas wealth unit, which has around 7,000 financial advisors, had net inflows of $13.6 billion during the first quarter. UBS started exploring ways it could partner with financial technology companies under former UBS Americas Wealth Chief Executive Bob McCann, his successor Tom Naratil said in an interview.     McCann led a delegation including UBS CEO Sergio Ermotti to Silicon Valley last year where the bankers met with a number of robo-adviser companies, including SigFig.      Naratil, who took over McCann's role in January, said UBS ultimately decided against buying a robo-adviser.    ""Our fear was that we would turn a technology firm like SigFig into us,"" he said. ""They're not us ... we want them to continue to be very creative and innovative."" Naratil said UBS would roll out the technology to a small group of investment advisers later this year and complete a full launch in 2017.(This version of the story has been refiled to add missing word ""firm"" in Naratil quote) (Reporting by Olivia Oran in New York; Editing by Richard Chang)",2016-05-16,BAC,"Mon May 16, 2016 | 11:31am EDT",REFILE-UBS Americas wealth unit partners with robo-adviser SigFig,http://www.reuters.com//article/ubs-wealth-idUSL2N18A1ML?type=companyNews

619,"   By Nate Raymond and Jonathan Stempel | NEW YORK  NEW YORK A U.S. appeals court on Monday threw out a jury's finding that Bank of America Corp was liable for mortgage fraud leading up to the 2008 financial crisis, voiding a $1.27 billion penalty and dealing the U.S. Department of Justice a major setback.The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York found insufficient proof under federal fraud statutes to establish Bank of America's liability over a mortgage program called ""Hustle"" run by the former Countrywide Financial Corp.The Justice Department claimed Countrywide, which Bank of America bought in July 2008, defrauded government-sponsored mortgage financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac  by selling them thousands of toxic loans.But in a 3-0 decision, U.S. Circuit Judge Richard Wesley said the evidence at most showed that Countrywide breached contracts to sell investment-quality loans, and that there was no proof it intended any deception.""The trial evidence fails to demonstrate the contemporaneous fraudulent intent necessary to prove a scheme to defraud through contractual promises,"" Wesley wrote.Bank of America said it was pleased with the ruling.

The lawsuit was filed in 2012 following a whistleblower's complaint, and remains one of the biggest government enforcement cases to go to trial in connection with the U.S. housing meltdown and financial crisis.A federal jury had in 2013 found Bank of America and Rebecca Mairone, a former midlevel Countrywide executive, liable for fraudulently selling shoddy loans originated through its ""High Speed Swim Lane"" program, also called HSSL or ""Hustle.""The Justice Department said the program rewarded staff for generating more mortgages and emphasizing speed over quality, and resulted in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac being lied to about the quality of loans they bought. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were seized by the government in September 2008 and remain in conservatorships.Following the verdict, U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in 2014 imposed a $1.27 billion penalty on Bank of America and ordered Mairone to pay $1 million.Bank of America was sued under the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989, a law adopted after the 1980s savings and loan scandal targeting conduct ""affecting"" federally insured financial institutions. The Justice Department has relied on FIRREA for several financial crisis-linked cases in part because it provides 10 years from the time of the alleged fraud to bring cases.Joshua Rosenkranz, a lawyer for Mairone, called the case ""a massive government overreach,"" and said Monday's decision could have ramifications for other mortgage-related enforcement actions against banks.But he said the decision was also narrow because it did not address a closely watched issue over whether the government could sue a bank under FIRREA for conduct ""affecting"" itself.No appeals court has addressed that issue, which has emerged in other cases against banks.The case is U.S. v.

The various actions occurred between 2007 and 2012.   With the Citigroup settlement, the CFTC said it has imposed more than $5 billion in penalties in 17 actions against banks and brokers for manipulating benchmarks for interest rates and foreign exchange.

638,"   By Mike Stone | June 16  June 16 Suncor Energy Inc has launched an auction of its Petro-Canada lubricants division, whose white mineral oils are sprayed on gummy bear candy to make it shiny and prevent sticking, people familiar with the matter said.The sale could fetch around $800 million and help Canada's biggest energy company pay down debt incurred by recent acquisitions, the people said this week.Calgary, Alberta-based Suncor, which merged with Petro-Canada in 2009, is working with Bank of America Corp  on the sale process, said the sources, asking not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Suncor did not respond to a request for comment and a representative for Bank of America declined to comment.Petro-Canada is the world's largest manufacturer of white mineral oil, which is used in health and beauty products, pharmaceuticals, adhesives, plastics and elastomers.

655,"  (Updates to include Bank of America results)By David HenryNEW YORK, July 15 Just as mortgage bankers were preparing for the end of a historic boom driven by low interest rates, borrowers have begun knocking at their doors again.In earnings reports over the past week, JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N, Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N, Bank of America Corp and Citigroup Inc C.N said they originated $115 billion worth of new mortgages during the second quarter in their core mortgage operations, an increase of $27 billion, or 30 percent, over the first quarter.The reason for the sudden burst of business? Mortgage rates have dropped to lows not seen since 2013 after the U.S. Federal Reserve dashed expectations for near-term rate hikes. That has led existing borrowers to try and lock in better rates. New borrowers, meanwhile, have been enticed by low borrowing costs and low down-payment offers.With mortgage rates near historic lows, and volumes still strong in the early days of the third quarter, banks predict the trend will continue, providing a bright spot in a low-rate environment hammering their wider results. JPMorgan has added more than 1,000 employees this year to handle the swell in mortgage business, said Mike Weinbach, its chief executive of mortgage banking. He believes U.S. lenders will make about $1.8 trillion of mortgage loans this year, 40 percent more than he had expected at the start of the year.""We thought the refinance market was going to shrink sharply,"" Weinbach said in an interview. ""We've seen a market that has been much bigger than expected.""All this may be cold comfort to big U.S. lenders that desperately need rates to rise for broader profits to improve. Though low rates bring in new mortgage business and deliver fees from refinancing, banks are hard pressed to generate substantial income when rates fall too low. Adding to the pressure on margins, US banks' cost of funding has also risen. The difference between what banks pay for U.S. dollars and the Federal Reserve's expected policy interest rates on Friday hit its widest since August 2012.At some point, there is little room left between what it costs banks to obtain funds and what they can earn from lending and investing. Rates on short- and long-term debt - known as the yield curve - have come closer together, leaving banks with razor thin margins almost regardless of the type of funding or loans they pursue.""The headwinds from a flatter yield curve and a lower-for-longer rate environment creates challenges for all financial institutions,"" said John Shrewsberry, chief financial officer of Wells Fargo, which is the No. 1 U.S. mortgage lender. Wells, JPMorgan, Citigroup and Bank of America each described low rates as a hurdle to producing better results. Their second-quarter profits fell in a range of 1 to 19 percent from a year earlier.The U.S. Federal Reserve set its interest rate target to nearly zero as the markets and economy were spiraling into crisis in 2008. The Fed kept rates there until December, it raised its target by 0.25 percentage points, causing optimism on Wall Street that rates would continue to rise gradually through 2016.Those hopes have since dimmed. Concerns about market volatility and apparent weakness in the U.S. economy earlier this year, combined with Britain's vote in June to exit the European Union have made it much less likely the Fed will raise rates further in the near-term.""While the rate situation is challenging, there are a few silver linings in the clouds,"" one of them being mortgages, said KBW analyst Fred Cannon.(Reporting by David Henry; Editing by Lauren Tara LaCapra and Andrew Hay)",2016-07-18,BAC,"Mon Jul 18, 2016 | 7:41am EDT",UPDATE 1-Rate-starved U.S. banks happily gobble mortgage business,http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-banks-mortgages-idUSL1N1A408D?type=companyNews

658,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, July 19 (Fitch) Bank of America's (BAC) second quarter 2016 earnings  improved relative to the sequential period due to better market conditions and  continued expense management efforts, according to Fitch Ratings.  BAC's total revenue expanded 4.5% from the sequential quarter but declined 7%  from the year-ago quarter. Overall return on average assets (ROA) was 0.78% in  2Q16, up from 0.50% in the sequential quarter but down from 0.96% in the  year-ago quarter. Similarly the company's return on average common equity (ROE)  was 6.5% in 2Q16, up from 3.8% in the sequential quarter but down from 8.4% in  the year-ago quarter. While Fitch recognizes the favorable sequential improvement in BAC's operating  performance, BAC's results remain below Fitch's estimate of the company's  long-term cost of equity assumption of between 10%-12%. Fitch would view  positively the company's ability to continue to consistently improve earnings to  at least its estimate of BAC's cost of equity all while maintaining good capital  and liquidity positions. Reported net interest income (NII) was up slightly from the sequential quarter,  but down from the year-ago quarter.  The quarter NII included $1bn of negative  market related adjustments. Similarly, overall non-interest income was up 8.1%  from the sequential quarter due primarily to higher trading account profits amid  incrementally better market conditions but down 2.7% from the year ago quarter,  which had stronger investment banking income, mortgage banking income, and  investment and brokerage services revenue. BAC's Global Banking and Global Markets segments were the biggest drivers  sequentially of revenue improvement. Global banking net revenue improved due to  higher leasing and treasury related revenue as well as higher advisory fees.  Fixed Income, Currency, & Commodities (FICC) drove the improvement in Global  Markets due to stronger performance in mortgage, credit, and currencies amid  more favorable trading conditions and higher market volatility. BAC's has continued to push down expenses, which has improved operating  performance. Overall expenses declined 8.9% relative to the sequential quarter,  which included payroll taxes and retirement eligible expenses, and 3.3% relative  to the year-ago quarter.  Efforts to reduce expenses include a continued focus on digitizing the company's  operations as well as continued headcount reductions in back and middle office  functions.  Credit quality for BAC generally remains good. Overall net charge-offs improved  in both the company's consumer and commercial loan portfolios. Additionally,  BAC's criticized energy exposure has begun to stabilize as the company recently  went through its oil price deck redetermination period. Many energy borrowers  have also benefited from higher oil prices. Overall provision expense declined $21mn relative to the sequential quarter due  to improvements in consumer asset quality, partially offset by some reserve  build due to loan growth, as well as holding the energy reserves unchanged at  $1.0bn. In Fitch's view, BAC's liquidity position remains sound with total deposits of  $1.2 trillion and a Time to Required Funding (debt coverage at parent) of 35  months. BAC's Basel III fully phased-in Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio improved under  the advanced approaches to 10.5%. Given that the advanced approaches ratio is  lower than standardized, it remains BAC's binding constraint. While this CET1 ratio is below the average of some peer institutions, the  denominator of the ratio does include a sizeable component of operational risk  weighted assets (RWA). BAC performed relatively well under the Comprehensive  Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) stress test and did not receive an objection  to its capital plan.  Additionally, BAC is in compliance with the Enhanced Supplementary Leverage  Ratio (SLR) at both the bank and parent company. The bank level SLR is at 7.4%,  well above the 6% minimum, and 6.9% at the parent company, well above the 5%  requirement.

Letters of credit are one of the most widely used ways to reduce risk between importers and exporters, helping guarantee more than $2 trillion worth of transactions, but the process creates a large paper trail and is time consuming. By putting the transaction on a distributed ledger, the importer and its bank, together with the exporter and its own bank, can see the data in real time. Financial services companies around the world have been focusing on developing blockchain technology, with advocates saying it has the potential to save billions of dollars in costs and speed up transaction times. The technology, which underpins the digital currency bitcoin, creates a shared database in which participants can trace every transaction. Discussions are underway with other banks, corporate clients and shipping companies to further develop the technology, which is in its early stages, said Vivek Ramachandran, global head of product for HSBC's trade finance business.

669,"  SAO PAULO Carlyle Group LP and Brazilian investor Guilherme Paulus raised a combined 1.230 billion reais ($394 million) from the partial sale of their stakes in Brazilian travel agency CVC Brasil Operadora SA (CVCB3.SA) , a sign investors are slowly returning to Latin America's largest equity market.CVC Brasil said on Thursday that the so-called restricted efforts offer was priced at 20.50 reais, representing a 3.8 percent discount to the stock's closing price of 21.30 reais on Wednesday. Carlyle and Paulus had put a combined 60 million shares up for sale, accounting for a 44.7 percent stake.In a statement, São Paulo-based CVC Brasil said that information on new shareholders and their respective stakes will  be available only on Aug. 16, when the transaction is expected to be settled. Before the offering, Carlyle and Paulus had about 69 percent of Brazil's biggest travel agency.Shares in the company had shed 18 percent of their value since July 20, when speculation of the combined stake sale began to mount.The successful conclusion of the transaction underscores the extent to which Brazil's image has improved in recent weeks among investors. Expectations that President Dilma Rousseff will be impeached this month are fanning optimism that what critics say are years of interventionist policies and budget profligacy in Latin America's largest economy are a thing of the past.Proceeds from the deal will go directly to Carlyle and Paulus, because the transaction was a secondary offering. Both shareholders hired the investment-banking units of Bank of America Corp, Itaú Unibanco Holding SA and Morgan Stanley & Co to manage the transaction. Public offerings with restricted efforts differ from standard equity offerings in that a company does not have to request registration of the plan with securities industry watchdog CVM, only qualified investors can participate, and the deals cannot be marketed through road shows or the media.  Prior to the CVC Brasil deal, Brazilian companies and their shareholders had raised 3.416 billion reais through restricted-efforts offerings in four transactions.

670,"  HONG KONG The British banker accused of murdering of two women, one found in a suitcase on the balcony of his luxury Hong Kong apartment and the other inside with neck and buttock wounds, attended a pre-trial hearing on Thursday ahead of his October trial.Rurik Jutting, 31, who has yet to enter a formal plea over the murders of two Indonesian women in 2014, looked dramatically different to earlier court appearances, mainly due to substantial weight loss and being clean shaven.Dressed in a button down shirt and black trousers and accompanied by four police officers, the former Bank of America Corp employee's court appearance was his first public appearance since last October after he was charged.No details from the hearing can be reported until a verdict has been reached. Jutting's trial is expected to start in late October. The grisly murders shocked the financial city of Hong Kong, a city with a low homicide rate. Local media have described the two victims as prostitutes from Indonesia.Bank of America has previously said Jutting was an employee but it has not said why he left or given any timeframe. A Linkedin account under Jutting's name said he had worked in structured equity finance and trading at Bank of America in Hong Kong since July 2013. Before that, he had worked in the same department but in London.The profile also said Jutting had worked in structured capital markets at Barclays between June 2008 and July 2010 and had studied at Cambridge University. According to people who were at Cambridge at the same time, Jutting attended Peterhouse, the oldest college, and was president of the Cambridge University History society. He was also a cross-country runner and a rower. Prior to Cambridge he went to Winchester College, one of Britain's oldest private schools.

680,"   By Carl O'Donnell and Greg Roumeliotis  PharMerica Corp (PMC.N), a U.S. pharmacy manager for long-term care facilities, is exploring strategic alternatives including a potential sale, according to people familiar with the matter.The move comes five years after PharMerica received an unsolicited bid from rival Omnicare Inc, which subsequently backed off from a hostile takeover after the U.S. Federal Trade Commission challenged the move on antitrust grounds.PharMerica is working with Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) and UBS Group AG (UBSG.S) on a sale process that has attracted interest from private equity firms, the people said. It is not certain that the company will decide to sell itself, the people cautioned.The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is not public. PharMerica, UBS and Bank of America declined to comment. PharMerica shares jumped as much as 19 percent on the news and were up 13 percent at $25.55 in late morning on the New York Stock Exchange, boosting the company's market capitalization to $800 million.PharMerica was created in 2007 by a merger of businesses spun off from AmerisourceBergen Corp (ABC.N) and Kindred Healthcare Inc (KND.N). It provides pharmacy services, ranging from dispensing prescriptions to trying to control drug costs, to about 15 percent of U.S. nursing homes. The company's sales have been under pressure as government payers such as Medicare reduce payments for some types of care. Earlier this month, its chief financial officer, David Froesel, announced plans to retire. The company is searching for a replacement. In recent years, pharmaceutical benefits managers, such as CVS Health Corporation (CVS.N) and Express Scripts Holding Co (ESRX.O), have been buying up specialty pharmacies as part of an effort to bolster their bargaining positions with drugmakers and hold down drug costs. In 2015, CVS Health acquired Omnicare for nearly $13 billion, including debt. The same year, Rite Aid Corp (RAD.N) acquired Envision Pharmaceutical Services from buyout firm TPG Capital LP for around $2 billion. Earlier this week, Reuters reported that a Canadian long-term care-oriented specialty pharmacy, Medical Pharmacies Group, is also exploring a sale.

697,"   By Patrick Rucker and Dan Freed | WASHINGTON/NEW YORK  WASHINGTON/NEW YORK U.S. lawmakers called on Thursday for Wells Fargo & Co chief John Stumpf to resign and a top House Democrat demanded the bank be broken up because it is too big to manage.Stumpf's second trip to Capitol Hill on Thursday went no better than his first as lawmakers from both parties rebuked his handling of sales abuses and said the bank had damaged customer trust as well as the broader banking system.Wells Fargo staff opened checking, savings and credit card accounts without customer say-so for years to satisfy managers' demand for new business, according to a $190 million settlement with regulators reached early this month.U.S. Representative Maxine Waters, the committee's senior Democrat, faulted the bank for identity theft in the fraud and called for Wells Fargo to be dismantled because it was too big to manage. She called the sales abuses ""some of the most egregious fraud we have seen since the foreclosure crisis."" After the hearing, the California lawmaker told reporters she would introduce legislation to break up Wells Fargo.The bank has said as many as 2 million accounts may have been wrongly opened and Stumpf promised to undo any harm to customers.The chief executive said, however, that Wells Fargo did not expect to see disgruntled bank customers in court.Wells Fargo is offering arbitration for its unhappy clients, Stumpf said. Pushed about whether he would waive that mandatory arbitration rule and allow customers to sue, Stumpf said: ""No."" Members of the House Financial Services Committee blasted Stumpf over the bank's culture, his compensation and whether the right people were being punished for opening fee-generating, phantom accounts.The episode has been a stunning reversal for Stumpf, long regarded as a safe pair of hands in the industry for navigating Wells Fargo successfully through the financial crisis. Stumpf again heard lawmakers calling for him to step aside. Jeb Hensarling, the Republican chairman of the committee, said in his opening statement he had lost faith in Wells Fargo, which does some of his banking.  ""Mr. Stumpf, I have a mortgage with your bank,"" Hensarling said. ""I wish I didn’t. I wish I was in the position to pay it off because you have broken my trust as you have broken the trust of millions.""Wells Fargo shares fell 2.07 percent to $44.37. Since Sept. 7, the last trading day before the scandal broke, its stock has lost 11 percent, or about $27 billion in market value, based on Reuters data. The stock is trading at its lowest since early 2014.BROKEN TRUST  Republicans on the committee have often advocated easing Wall Street regulations, but they were among Stumpf's strongest critics at Thursday's hearing.Asked by Representative Sean Duffy, a Republican from Wisconsin, about whether Wells Fargo employees 'stole,' Stumpf said: ""In some cases, they did.""""I am deeply sorry that we didn't do the right thing,"" Stumpf said in response to a lawmaker who said the scandal had eroded the bank's market value.Representative Steve Pearce, a Republican from New Mexico, faulted Stumpf for saying the company's board could eventually be relied on to sanction the executives responsible.""I, sir, think you ought to submit a resignation and your board cannot hold off action on that,"" he said.  Representative Brad Sherman, a Democrat from California, asked the committee to summon other Wall Street chiefs, including from Citigroup Inc and Bank of America Corp, to determine if they had imposed sales demands and quotas on their employees.""I don't think, Mr. Stumpf, that you should be alone in this joyous experience,"" Sherman said.Stumpf said the bank was strengthening oversight of sales tactics, changing procedures for issuing credit cards and had paid back past and current customers for any fees incurrent on the ghost accounts.Earlier this week, the bank took back $41 million in stock awarded to Stumpf, an unprecedented rebuke to a major U.S. bank chief executive officer.Democratic Representative Carolyn Maloney of New York raised questions about $13 million in stock sales by the CEO in 2013 after he learned about the abuses. Stumpf said he sold stock with proper approvals and added the sales were made ""with no view about what was going on."" The affair has triggered lawsuits, more investigations and wiped more than $20 billion from the bank's market value.While Wells Fargo may be shielded from some customer actions, the bank may just be starting to face heightened regulatory scrutiny.On Thursday, the bank agreed to pay the Justice Department $4.1 million to resolve allegations it illegally repossessed cars owned by U.S. service members. In a separate settlement of similar allegations, the bank will pay a $20 million settlement with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.

701,"  Johnson dominates rain-delayed Bank of America 500CONCORD, N.C. -- Jimmie Johnson claimed his third win of the 2016 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series season, but his first since winning at Auto Club Speedway in Fontana, Calif., in March, with his victory in the Bank of America 500 at Charlotte Motor Speedway on Sunday.""I didn't wonder (when the next win would come),"" Johnson said. ""I just knew it was taking way too long. When you drive for Rick Hendrick and have all the great people at Hendrick Motorsports working for you, the great support from Lowe's and everyone in their stores and Chevrolet, there are just so many great people behind us and that support us to make this happen. We knew we would get back. Yes, it was slower than we wanted it to be, but to be here today and have this victory is great. Thank you to Sprint, to the fans, to Gatorade, and to Valvoline. This is something very special to our team.""The race was scheduled for Saturday night but was postponed to Sunday because of rain from Hurricane Matthew.The win was Johnson's eighth-career victory at Charlotte and guarantees his advancement to the third round of the Chase for the Sprint Cup.Matt Kenseth finished second after starting the race in the back for an unapproved pre-race change to his car. He also served a pit-road penalty during the first caution of the race on lap 26.""It was a great-second,"" Kenseth said. ""I think this is one of the toughtest tracks there is on the circuit to pass at. It was better during the day than it is at night, and that's a good thing because we had to go to the back twice, so we were able to make up some ground and finish okay.""Three non-Chase competitors rounded out the top-five, with Kasey Kahne, Ryan Newman and Kyle Larson finishing third through fifth, respectively. Larson made the 2016 Chase but was eliminated last weekend at Dover (Del.) International Speedway. After restarting in the lead following a lap 117 caution, Johnson dominated throughout the remainder of the 334-lap race. Denny Hamlin did get by him on the restart and led 52 laps, but Johnson got back by to take command on lap 176 led most of the remaining laps.Kenseth got off pit road ahead of Johnson during the eighth and final caution of the race that came out for Hamlin's blown engine with 26 laps remaining, but Johnson retook the lead after trailing for a lap and drove on to the win.Hamlin was one of several Chase for the Sprint Cup competitors to have problems at Charlotte. After losing the lead to Johnson, he remained in the top-five and was running second to Johnson when his engine blew.Other Chasers with problems included Kevin Harvick and Joey Logano. Harvick fell off the pace and wound up going to the garage for a mechanical issue just before a caution on lap 156.""It just suddenly shut off and the things that it points to are no oil pressure,"" Harvick said. ""It's definitely not a power issue with the battery or anything like that. They are trying to diagnose it. I hate it for everybody on our Busch team; they made some great adjustments today and got our car back where we needed to be to run up front and everything was going fine. Lots of things can go wrong, and today, they did.""The lap 156 yellow flag came as a result of Logano making hard contact with the wall. It was the second-consecutive caution for a Logano wreck into the wall, with the first coming on lap 117. ""Tires are popping,"" Logano said. ""We're not the only car that had the issue, but we're the ones that hit the wall when it happened, so that's not the best place to have them go down. We had a fast car. Our car was capable of winning the race. We drove up from 10th and were up to third and running down the leaders, so I felt good about what we had. I don't know. Things happen. It's part of racing, I guess.""Two more Chasers, Chase Elliott and Austin Dillon, suffered substantial damage to their cars in a multi-car wreck on a lap 259 restart. The wreck looked to initially be a result of contact between Martin Truex Jr. and Dillon. Dillon was up front after taking only two tires, while everyone else took four on the previous pit stops.""I think the No. 3, they stayed out on tires and tried to get some track psoition,"" Elliott said. ""The No. 78 (Truex) ended up getting him out of shape and then after that, I tried to check up. I don't think the No. 18 (Kyle Busch) saw it, got into us and got us turned the wrong way. It happens; we just got to go and try to have more runs like that next week.""A couple of other cars in the Chase, those of Joe Gibbs Racing teammates Kyle Busch and Carl Edwards, also sustained damage.The red flag was displayed for 10 minutes and 48 seconds for track clean-up.Like Hamlin, both Harvick and Elliott led laps before their struggles. Harvick started on the pole and led the first 12 laps before giving way to Elliott on lap 13. Elliott dominated the first third of the race. He led 102 laps before giving up the top spot to pit during a green-flag cycle of stops on lap 114.NOTES: The Bank of America is the first race of the three-race second round of the 10-race Chase for the Sprint Cup. Logano won last year's Bank of America 500 en route to sweeping all three races of the round. ... Harvick's pole of Sunday's race was his first pole of 2016 and the first of his career at Charlotte Motor Speedway. ... Truex Jr. dominated the last time the Sprint Cup Series visited Charlotte Motor Speedway, leading all but eight laps -- 12 miles -- of the 400-lap Coca-Cola 600 in May. In that race, he claimed his first of four wins this season. ... Truex won two of the three races that made up the first round. Harvick won the other. ... Hurricane Matthew forced the cancellation of all on-track activity at CMS on Friday and Saturday, including Friday's Sprint Cup practice. The series did get in a practice session before qualifying on Thursday, though.",2016-10-09,BAC,"Sun Oct 9, 2016 | 5:17pm EDT",Johnson dominates rain-delayed Bank of America 500,http://www.reuters.com//article/car-nascar-sprint-writethru-idUSMTZECA9SRJ9US?type=companyNews
702,"   By Liana B. Baker and Greg Roumeliotis  Mentor Graphics Corp, a company that makes software for designing semiconductors, is working with Bank of America Corp to explore strategic alternatives, including a potential sale, according to people familiar with the matter.Mentor has been under pressure since activist hedge fund Elliott Management Corp reported an 8.1 percent stake in the company last month and said its shares were deeply undervalued.As part of the sale process, Mentor may reach out to major industrial companies with software operations, such as Siemens AG and Dassault Systemes SA, as well as private equity firms, to gauge potential acquisition interest, one of the people said.There is no certainty that a sale of Mentor will occur, the people cautioned. The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Mentor, Siemens and Dassault did not immediately respond to requests for comment, while Elliott and Bank of America declined to comment. Mentor Graphics, based in Wilsonville, Oregon, and run by Chief Executive Wally Rhines, is no stranger to activist investors or takeover offers. Billionaire activist Carl Icahn won a proxy fight in 2011 that secured him three board seats, although he exited his investment in the company in April after six years.Mentor also fended off a hostile takeover by rival Cadence Design Systems Inc in 2008.  The electronic design automation company, which has a market capitalization of $3 billion, sells software tools to semiconductor firms that use it to design and test their chips before manufacturing them. Its peers include Cadence and Synopsys Inc.Mentor's shares have recovered after a disappointing earnings outlook last November. As of Friday's close, shares were up about 12 percent since Elliott took a stake last month. Elliott said last month there were numerous operational opportunities in Mentor, ""including enhancing operational efficiency and revenue quality, as well as strategic opportunities."" It said it had initiated a dialogue with the company's management and board of directors regarding those opportunities. A sale of Mentor would follow successful activist campaigns by Elliott such as Qlik Technologies, Riverbed, Informatica and Compuware. All these companies were sold to private equity firms after the hedge fund invested. SteetInsider.com reported on Oct. 13, citing a source it did not identify, that Mentor had hired a financial adviser to review strategic alternatives, including a possible sale.

703,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, October 17 (Fitch) Bank of America's (BAC) third quarter 2016 (3Q16)  earnings improved relative to both the sequential and year-ago periods due to  improvements across all of its businesses but particularly in the Global Markets  businesses, according to Fitch Ratings.  BAC's overall return on average assets (ROA) was 0.90%, up 2 basis points (bps)  from the sequential quarter and 6 bps from the year-ago quarter.  The company's  return on average common equity (ROE) in 3Q16 was 7.27%, which is just slightly  lower than the sequential quarter result of 7.40%, but up from the year-ago  quarter's result of 7.16%. Given the large amount of goodwill on BAC's balance  sheet from legacy acquisitions, on a tangible basis BAC's ROE in 3Q16 was  10.28%. The major driver of BAC's better operating performance was improved results in  the company's Global Markets segment.  Sales and Trading (ex. DVA) revenue in  the company's Fixed Income Currency and Commodities (FICC) businesses increased  5.81% relative to the sequential quarter and 38.91% relative to the year ago.   This significant improvement was due to good performance in mortgages, rates,  and client financings.   Performance in the Equities business was more challenging with revenue down  11.60% from the sequential quarter and 16.81% from the year-ago quarter due to  low levels of client activity in both cash equities and derivatives. This is  consistent with equities performance seen at other large banks.  Given the FICC's proportionately larger revenue contribution, it more than  offset the challenges in the Equities business this quarter.  While Fitch views  this improvement favorably, it also notes that FICC has been one of the more  variable business segments for BAC as well as others in the industry over the  last year, given its earnings volatility.   BAC's Global Banking businesses also enjoyed improved results this quarter due  largely to improved debt and equity issuance fees.  While issuance levels were  relatively subdued in the first part of 2016, they increased during this  quarter, particularly in investment grade debt issuance. BAC's largest business segment measured by both revenue and net income remains  its scalable consumer business.  While revenue in this segment was only up 2.22%  from the sequential quarter and essentially flat from the year-ago quarter, net  income was up 8.11% from the sequential quarter and 3.19% from the year ago  quarter.  This was driven by BAC's continued efforts to drive down costs and  improve efficiencies. BAC continues to drive efficiencies across all of its businesses, and in the  consumer segment this includes continuing to rationalize its branch footprint.   In 3Q16, BAC lowered its branch count by 112 branches to 4,629.  Fitch expects  continued branch rationalization and optimization to persist in concert with the  company's emphasis on digital servicing and distribution channels. BAC's net interest yield was 2.23% in 3Q16, flat relative to the sequential  quarter and up 4 bps from the year-ago quarter.  It is also noteworthy that BAC  switched to the contractual methoed for accounting for premium amortization  under from FAS 91 this quarter.  This changed the way premium amortization on  its bond portfolio was calculated from one based on estimated principal  prepayments assumptions to one based on a constant effective yield adjusted for  actual prepayment experience. Overall credit performance for BAC continues to remain good.  Overall net charge  offs (NCOs) were 0.40% in 3Q16, down from 0.44% in the sequential quarter and  0.43% in the year-ago quarter.  This sequential decline was due to lower losses  in BAC's residential real estate portfolio and consumer credit card portfolio as  well as lower energy related losses.   Given the lower loss levels, BAC's overall provision expense was $850 million  during the quarter, reflecting a $38 million reserve release.  The overall  allowance now stands at $11.7 billion, or 1.3% of total loans. There was a $300 million increase in non-performing loans in BAC's commercial  lending due to a borrower in the metals and mining group as well as a borrower  in the energy lending business.  Nevertheless overall non-performing loan levels  remain modest within the context of BAC's overall loan portfolio. Fitch continues to believe that overall credit performance for BAC as well as  the rest of the industry remains near cyclical lows, and that there is likely to  be some reversion in credit costs over the next couple of years. In Fitch's view, BAC's liquidity position remains sound with total deposits of  $1.23 trillion and a Time to Required Funding (debt coverage at parent) of 38  months. BAC's Basel III fully phased-in Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio improved under  the advanced approaches to 10.9%. Given that the advanced approaches ratio is  lower than standardized, it remains BAC's binding constraint. While this CET1 ratio is below the average of some peer institutions, the  denominator of the ratio does include a sizeable component of operational risk  weighted assets (RWA).   Additionally, BAC is in compliance with the Enhanced Supplementary Leverage  Ratio (SLR) at both the bank and parent company. The bank level SLR is at 7.5%,  well above the 6% minimum, and 7.1% at the parent company, well above the 5%  requirement.

704,"   By Richa Naidu and Dan Freed  Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), the second-largest U.S. bank by assets, reported its first profit increase in three quarters on Monday, foiling expectations for another drop, as bond trading surged and expenses fell.Like rivals JPMorgan (JPM.N) and Citigroup (C.N), Bank of America enjoyed a boost from a resurgence in trading. That came as clients scrambled to reposition after Britain's surprise June vote to leave the European Union, and changing expectations for monetary policy in the United States, Europe and Japan.Chief Executive Brian Moynihan's cost-cutting campaign also paid off as expenses fell in each of its four major business segments.On a pretax basis, quarterly profit was at its highest in a decade. Net income attributable to shareholders rose 6.6 percent to $4.45 billion in the third quarter ended Sept. 30 from a year ago. Earnings per share rose to 41 cents, from 38 cents in the same period of 2015. Analysts, on average, had estimated a decline to 34 cents a share.Revenue grew 3 percent to $21.64 billion, beating the $20.97 billion expected by analysts.Net profit in Bank of America's trading-focused Global Markets arm jumped 34 percent from a year earlier as revenue from dealing fixed-income securities, currencies and commodities surged 39 percent. Equity trading revenue fell 17 percent.  Last week, JPMorgan reported a 48 percent increase in bond trading and Citi posted a 35 percent gain. Trading in stocks rose 1 percent and fell 34 percent respectively at JPMorgan and Citi.Like Bank of America, JMorgan, Citigroup and Wells Fargo beat third-quarter profit and revenue forecasts but their net earnings declined; JPMorgan Chase & Co's (JPM.N) by 7.6 percent, Citigroup Inc's (C.N) by 10.5 percent and Wells Fargo & Co's (WFC.N) by 3.7 percent.Shares of Bank of America were little changed, up 0.15 percent in afternoon trading. Ahead of Monday, the stock had shed 4.9 percent since the start of the year, compared to a 2.5 percent decline in the KBW banking index .BKX. DUAL ROLES After scandal-ridden Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) separated its chief executive and chairman roles last week with the retirement of John Stumpf, Moynihan was asked during a conference call on Monday whether he expected renewed pressure to give up his dual role from regulators or shareholders.""Our lead independent director duty is as strong as anybody's in the industry,"" said Moynihan, who had faced down a shareholder vote last year over whether to split the roles. He added that he felt ""comfortable"" with the bank's current governance.  Bank of America's large stock of deposits and rate-sensitive mortgage securities make it particularly dependent on a rise in interest rates to boost profits.To compensate for stubbornly low interest rates, Moynihan made trimming costs a top priority, saying in July he would cut annual expenses by another $5 billion by 2018, which would take the total to about $53 billion from about $58 billion in 2015.In the third quarter, non-interest expenses fell 3.3 percent to $13.48 billion as headcount fell by 3 percent.Like rivals, Bank of America got a boost from a rise in the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, a benchmark for more than $300 trillion worth of financial products worldwide.Libor moved to a seven-year high during the third quarter as U.S. money market funds scaled back holdings in short-term bank debt in advance of new regulations.   Bank of America's net interest income rose 3 percent to $10.20 billion, the first increase in three quarters.Like JPMorgan and Wells Fargo, BofA set aside more money to cover potential bad loans. The bank's provisions rose 5.5 percent to $850 million in the quarter.Income from investment banking rose 13.3 percent to $1.46 billion, driven by higher debt and equity issuance activity. Revenue for advising on deals tumbled 19 percent as companies held off making acquisitions amid political uncertainty in the United States and Brexit-related volatility in Britain.Adjusted revenue from Bank of America's wealth and investment management unit, which includes Merrill Lynch, fell 1.7 percent to $4.38 billion, but a 6 percent drop in non-interest expenses helped to boost net income by 10 percent.The wealth business, which has been a stable source of revenue growth when trading and investment banking revenues have fluctuated, is undergoing its own changes, with a new boss, longtime executive Andy Sieg, expected to take over in 2017 and amid a regulatory overhaul of financial advice in the United States.

706,"  Oct 17 Bank of America Corp, the second-largest U.S. bank by assets, reported its first rise in profit in three quarters on Monday, boosted by strong results from bond trading.Net income attributable to shareholders rose 6.6 percent to $4.45 billion in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, from $4.18 billion a year earlier.Earnings per share rose to 41 cents from 38 cents in the same period of 2015. Analysts on average had expected earnings of 34 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. It was not immediately clear if the figures were comparable.Revenue from fixed-income trading jumped 32 percent, boosted by Brexit-inspired volatility and changing expectations for monetary policy in the United States, Europe and Japan. Non-interest expenses fell 3.3 percent to $13.48 billion. BofA, like its peers, has been slashing costs to help make up for weak income from lending after years of low interest rates. Chief Executive Brian Moynihan said in July the bank would cut annual costs by another $5 billion by 2018, which would take the total to about $53 billion from about $58 billion in 2015.The three other big U.S. banks that have reported third-quarter results all beat profit and revenue forecasts. However, their earnings also declined - JPMorgan Chase & Co's  by 7.6 percent, Citigroup Inc's by 10.5 percent and Wells Fargo & Co's by 3.7 percent.

709,"   By Olivia Oran and Sweta Singh  Morgan Stanley reported a better-than-expected profit on Wednesday, boosted by a surge in bond trading that helped all Wall Street banks last quarter.Morgan Stanley's gains were especially notable. Its adjusted bond-trading revenue more than doubled, hitting Chief Executive James Gorman's revenue target for that business for the second quarter in a row.The bank had struggled for years to improve in bond trading, which has volatile revenue and tough capital requirements to meet. Earlier this year, Morgan Stanley restructured the unit, cutting 25 percent of staff and appointing new leadership.In an interview, Chief Financial Officer Jonathan Pruzan said the bank was on the right track, though it might be too soon to claim victory.""The success we've had in the last quarter or two has boosted morale and confidence of the team,"" he said. ""But these things take time and until we can do it for years as opposed to quarters, we're not going to declare success.""Though it is still early in the fourth quarter, Pruzan said the trading environment has so far been similar to the end of September.Overall, Morgan Stanley's earnings applicable to common shareholders rose 62 percent to $1.5 billion, from $939 million in the same quarter a year earlier. Earnings per share rose to 81 cents from 48 cents, helped by stock buybacks.Analysts had estimated earnings of 63 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Revenue rose 15 percent to $8.9 billion. Analysts had expected revenue of $8.2 billion. Non-interest expenses rose just 4 percent, reflecting a cost-cutting program that Morgan Stanley hopes will shave $1 billion from annual expenses by next year. That program, called Project Streamline, is on track despite costs associated with the bank's stress test resubmission as well as Brexit, Pruzan said. Morgan Stanley's shares rose 0.8 percent to $32.57 at midday.STRONG QUARTER    Morgan Stanley wrapped up a surprisingly strong quarter for big U.S. banks. Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Morgan Stanley's closest rival, reported a better-than-expected 58 percent rise in third-quarter profit on Tuesday.Bond trading was strong across Wall Street, driven by Britain's surprise vote to leave the European Union and bouts of anxiety about monetary policy around the world. Morgan Stanley's bond-trading revenue rose to $1.5 billion in the third quarter from $583 million in the year-ago period, when stripping out accounting gains and losses related to the value of its own bonds. ""We obviously did much better than probably anybody felt this quarter ...,"" Gorman said during a call with analysts. ""... But we did not and are not going to run any victory lap around fixed income.""Despite that rebound, Morgan Stanley posted an 8.7 percent return on equity, which is less than Gorman's stated target of 9 percent to 11 percent by the end of 2017.Pruzan said he continued to believe that the bank's target ROE was achievable.  Equities sales and trading revenue, a traditional bright spot for the bank, edged up just 1 percent to $1.9 billion.Revenue from investment banking fell about 7 percent to $1.23 billion, due to weaker M&A fees and capital markets activity. Morgan Stanley ranked third to Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase & Co in M&A fees collected during the quarter and fourth behind JPMorgan, Bank of America Corp and Goldman in fees from investment banking, which includes equity and debt underwriting, according to Thomson Reuters data.Revenue from wealth management, which Morgan Stanley has been building for several years, rose 7 percent to $3.9 billion.

717,"   By Dena Aubin | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Bank of America Corp has been hit with a proposed class action accusing it of charging exorbitant fees to thousands of former Arizona prison inmates who were issued debit cards when they were released.Filed on Thursday in federal court in Phoenix, the lawsuit accused the bank of exploiting ""one of the most vulnerable groups imaginable"" - individuals coming out of prison without a job or sometimes even a place to go.The prepaid cards are issued to prisoners to return money confiscated when they were arrested or that they earned through work programs.Prisoners are given no choice other than the fee-laden cards to obtain their own money from inmate accounts, the complaint said. Charges include some that ordinary consumers would not have to pay, such as $15 to withdraw money at a bank teller window, the complaint said. ""They get charged a fee just to walk up to a teller to find out how much money they have in their accounts,"" said Richard Golomb, lead counsel for the ex-prisoners. The fees are based on a debit card contract ""that they never agreed to and never signed,"" he said. Representatives of Bank of America and the Arizona Department of Corrections could not immediately be reached for comment.More than 19,000 inmates are released each year by the Arizona Department of Corrections, the lawsuit said. Bank of America can impose whatever terms it wants because it has an exclusive right to provide the debit cards to Arizona inmates, the lawsuit said. Bank of America is the latest bank to face a lawsuit over prepaid cards issued to prisoners. JPMorgan Chase & Co in August agreed to pay $446,822 to settle a similar action stemming from its contract with the U.S. Bureau of Prisons to issue debit cards to ex-inmates nationwide.According to the complaint against Bank of America, the debit cards exploit a loophole in federal regulations that protect the rights of other consumers. Under the U.S. Electronic Funds Transfer Act and related regulations, companies cannot force individuals to receive wages on prepaid debit cards, but that rule applies to ""recurring"" payments, not one-time payments to former inmates, the lawsuit said.

718,"   By Lawrence Hurley | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday indicated it could allow Miami to pursue lawsuits accusing major banks of predatory mortgage lending to black and Hispanic home buyers resulting in loan defaults that drove down city tax revenues and property values.The eight justices heard arguments in appeals filed by Bank of America Corp and Wells Fargo & Co challenging a lower court's decision to permit the lawsuits by the Florida city against the banks. The cases were filed under the Fair Housing Act, a federal law outlawing discrimination in housing. In September 2015, the Atlanta-based 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned a lower court's decision to dismiss such lawsuits by the city against Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Citigroup Inc. Citigroup decided not to appeal to the Supreme Court. If the court splits 4-4, the 11th Circuit ruling would stand and Miami would prevail, but no national precedent would be set.Based on the questions asked by the justices, it appeared unlikely the banks would gain the five votes needed to win the case outright. But it was possible that a ruling for Miami could allow the lawsuits to move forward while narrowing the scope of the cases and potentially lowering the amount of damages the city could win.Chief Justice John Roberts seemed most skeptical of the city's lawsuit, at one point questioning whether a loss of property taxes could count as a direct injury that could give rise to a lawsuit. Roberts said the city's alleged injuries are ""derivative of the injury to the homeowners who had the subprime mortgages and who suffered the foreclosure and so on."" Fellow conservative Justice Anthony Kennedy, who could cast the key vote to avoid a 4-4 split, seemed somewhat sympathetic to the banks, particularly over the amount of damages they could face. Liberal Justice Elena Kagan was among those who seemed open to the case moving forward, saying the Fair Housing Act was designed to address harms to communities, not just individuals. ""Who better than the city to recognize that interest and assert it?"" Kagan said. The banks have said a ruling favoring Miami would lead to a surge of similar suits.The court is due to rule by the end of June. Miami accused Wells Fargo, Bank of America and Citigroup of steering non-white borrowers into higher-cost loans they often could not afford, even if they had good credit.The city said the banks' conduct caused Miami to lose property tax revenues, drove down property values and required the city to pay the costs of repairing and maintaining properties that went into foreclosure due to discriminatory lending.Several U.S. cities, including Los Angeles and Oakland, have launched similar lawsuits.

721,"   By Dan Freed | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Nov 15 Bank of America Corp is on track to report better fourth-quarter trading revenue because of higher volumes around the U.S. presidential election, Chief Operating Officer Tom Montag said on Tuesday.""Quarter-to-date has continued to be pretty good relative to last year,"" Montag said at an industry conference in New York. ""Not as robust as the third quarter was but still double-digit improvement ... year-over-year."" Bank of America's client trading volumes on both the New York Stock Exchange and in Japan were higher than ever due to the election, he added. Montag also said he hopes the election of Donald Trump will allow the bank to save money complying with post-crisis regulations such as the Volcker Rule, which is intended to prevent banks from making big directional bets on the market. Trump and certain influential members of Congress have indicated they will dismantle or change Dodd-Frank, the sweeping reform law passed in 2010. Montag is being ""a little more cautious"" about spending money on regulatory compliance until there is clarity on what will be done, he said.""There is a chance they change something in Volcker, maybe they change it appreciably,"" Montag said.

722,"   By Olivia Oran  Wells Fargo & Co is set to announce a partnership with SigFig for clients to use the robo-adviser's technology and wealth management investment tools.    The announcement is expected on Tuesday, the bank said, with Wells likely to roll out a pilot version of the service during the first half of 2017. ""As we continue to invest in technology that serves the evolving needs of our clients and our advisors, this offering will mark an important step forward in delivering financial advice to the next generation of investors, while building a long-term pipeline for our full-service business,"" said David Carroll, head of wealth and investment management at Wells Fargo.     Wall Street banks and investment firms are increasingly building or buying robo-advisers to provide automated investment advice through web-based platforms at a lower cost than traditional financial advisers.  Unlike Betterment and Wealthfront which have focused on catering directly to young, tech-savvy millennials, SigFig has been forging relationships with banks. UBS Group AG said in May it had bought an undisclosed stake in SigFig. The two companies also said they would form a research lab to collaborate on new wealth technology. Wells' strategy of putting SigFig in the hands of its investing customers is different than that of UBS, which is rolling out the service for its financial advisers to help construct investment portfolios and other activities that can be automated.     Morgan Stanley and Bank of America Corp are building their own technologies, while BlackRock Inc acquired FutureAdvisor last August. The digital wealth management market could top $20 trillion in assets by 2020, according to consulting firm A.T. Kearney.

724,"   By Dan Freed | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Nov 29 It may be more than a decade before banks see substantial benefits from investments they are now making in new payments technologies, Bank of America Corp  Chief Executive Brian Moynihan said on Tuesday.The industry has been investing heavily in digital methods of exchanging money, including a U.S. payments network called Zelle. But the cost of processing paper checks and carting around dollars and cents still weighs heavily on big banks, and it may take 10 to 15 years before that problem goes away, Moynihan said at a conference organized by The Clearinghouse, a trade group focused on payments. ""Even though mobile wallets, credit cards and debit cards all grow, you still have a lot of cash and a lot of other things, so it will take time for customers to change,"" he said in an interview with Reuters following a panel discussion.Roughly 10 percent of Bank of America's costs come from moving coins, currency and checks throughout the banking system, Moynihan said during the panel discussion. The Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank reported $32.9 billion in operating costs for the first nine months of this year. Credit cards worked as a profitable payment system for the banking industry for a long time. However, a 2010 financial reform law placed limits on fees banks can charge to process transactions, making the business less lucrative.""We had this great system called Visa and Mastercard, which we built for years,"" said Moynihan, ""but it gets attacked on expense.""
