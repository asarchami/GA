0,"  * Shares rise as much as 6.4 percent* Jackson warns of high inventories* Analyst says slow January sales will pressure auto dealer groupsBy Bernie WoodallJan 30 AutoNation Inc, the largest U.S. automobile dealer group, sped by Wall Street's quarterly earnings expectations on robust sales of luxury cars like Mercedes-Benz and BMW, and its shares rose as high as 6.4 percent.AutoNation said on Thursday that its fourth-quarter income from what it calls new premium-luxury vehicles increased 28 percent to $102.7 million. The segment accounted for 46 percent of total new-vehicle income.""The shining star really's got to be Mercedes-Benz for introducing two new products simultaneously at different ends of the spectrum with the CLA and the S-Class,"" AutoNation Chief Operating Officer Mike Maroone said in a telephone interview. ""Demand for those products was extraordinary.""The CLA is an entry-level vehicle costing about $30,000, and the S-Class sedan is the flagship of Daimler AG's  Mercedes-Benz brand. The average purchase price for an S-Class sedan is $94,000, according to TrueCar.com.Mercedes-Benz vehicles accounted for 10 percent of AutoNation's new-vehicle sales in the quarter, and BMW  accounted for 5.6 percent. They were followed by Toyota Motor Corp's namesake brand at 18.6 percent; Ford Motor Co , 16.5 percent; Honda Motor Co's namesake brand, 11 percent; and Nissan Motor Co's namesake brand, 10 percent. AutoNation's net income rose to $109.4 million, or 89 cents per share, in the quarter from $83.2 million, or 67 cents per share, a year earlier.Excluding a tax benefit and gains from changes in owning property, earnings of 83 cents per share beat analysts' expectations of 76 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Revenue rose 8 percent to $4.52 billion, but missed analysts' expectations of $4.59 billion.Shares of Fort Lauderdale, Florida-based AutoNation were up 5 percent at $49.38 on Thursday morning after rising as high as $50.02. Morgan Stanley analyst Ravi Shanker said a higher-than-expected margin of 4.5 percent was a key reason that the stock rose.WARNING AUTOMAKERS AGAIN AutoNation Chief Executive Officer Mike Jackson, who used to run the Mercedes-Benz brand for Daimler in the United States, has been warning for several months that high inventories could bite into profits for automakers and dealer groups. He did so again in a telephone interview on Thursday. ""I'm overall very optimistic, very positive,"" said Jackson. ""I'm just observing that taking inventories to these levels is an inefficiency that we should really focus on this year and bring it back in line.""Some vehicle dealers and auto company executives as well as most industry analysts are worried that inventories will rise beyond demand this year. That is because auto plants have returned to full production and have been churning out cars and trucks at a greater clip than just after the 2008-2010 downturn in U.S. sales.Jackson said he feared that automakers, particularly those targeting the mass market, would produce too many vehicles, which could cause them to offer heavy consumer incentives to move product on dealer lots.Jeff Schuster, senior vice president of forecasting at LMC Automotive, said that while there should be concern, he was confident that automakers will be disciplined on incentives, which they generally have been since the 2008-2010 downturn in the U.S. new-vehicle business.""Even if we have a weather-induced slowdown from January, which I think we will have, I don't think over-inventory is going to plague the auto industry this year,"" Schuster said.But Buckingham Research analyst Joseph Amaturo said slow January sales would put pressure on corporate auto dealer groups, of which AutoNation is the largest by a wide margin.Automakers will report their U.S. sales for January on Monday.",2014-01-30,AN,"Thu Jan 30, 2014 | 11:26am EST",UPDATE 2-AutoNation profit rises as Mercedes sales jump,http://www.reuters.com//article/autonation-results-idUSL2N0L41AO20140130?type=companyNews

Last year, the industry sold 15.6 million new cars and light trucks.""It was one of the most unusual quarters I've ever seen where the first 10 weeks of the year we're struggling with this epic winter and the consumer went into hibernation, and you wondered when and if they would ever come out,"" he said in a telephone interview.""Then at the end of March, they emerged in a phenomenal pace and business just boomed the last two weeks in March and we've seen that same level of intensity continuing into the beginning of the spring market with April,"" he added.

Income increased in the company's domestic and premium luxury segments in the quarter by 9 percent and 21 percent, respectively, and fell 8 percent for imports.Sales in the quarter rose 7 percent from last year to $4.36 billion, slightly above the $4.32 billion analysts had expected. retail new-vehicle sales rose 4 percent on a same-store basis and 6 percent overall. AutoNation has seen ""little impact"" on sales from the fallout surrounding General Motors Co's (GM.N) defective ignition switches linked to at least 13 deaths and the recall of 2.6 million vehicles, Chief Operating Officer Mike Maroone said. AutoNation has begun to receive ""a pretty good cadence"" of the replacement parts to repair the cars, he added.Jackson also said AutoNation also will move away from paying third-party lead providers such as Cars.com and TrueCar.com as the company looks to build its own digital business one year into rebranding all its stores under the AutoNation name.The company's web sites are generating more than the business from the third-party providers combined, and AutoNation will invest $100 million over the next several years to boost its digital offerings further, he said.

Indeed, this factor could be a negative for other U.S. auto dealer groups that are due to report earnings later in the month.Mike Jackson, the company's chief executive, told Reuters that Wall Street analysts had underestimated the pace at which AutoNation would spend $100 million to upgrade its online presence over the next few years.Jackson, who had announced the digital investment in April, declined Thursday to say how much of that amount was spent on its online operations in the second quarter.In an interview with Reuters, Jackson said that the massive recall of General Motors vehicles will be ""a wash"" for AutoNation and unlikely to impact its earnings.

In the quarter, the proportion of revenue linked to used vehicle sales fell to 22.6 percent from 23.9 percent a year earlier.  Indeed, dealers such as AutoNation may face further expenses linked to recalls. While automakers such as GM pay dealers for recall expenses, Maroone told Reuters the company needed to hire more technicians to handle the recalls. Maroone said that while AutoNation had already planned to hire 400 additional auto technicians for their 273 franchises in 15 U.S. states, the GM recall necessitated the hiring of ""hundreds"" more than that this year.Jackson said AutoNation and its dealers ""have a long way to go"" in fixing all of the GM cars recalled.

""The results at Lithia clearly point to a change in the used vehicle pricing market that may add some incremental pressure to the used vehicle gross profit performance across the auto sector,"" RBC Capital Markets analysts wrote in a note.Retail sales of used vehicles made up about a quarter of Lithia's gross profit in 2013. Used vehicle sales accounted for about 12 percent of AutoNation's 2013 gross profit and for about 14.2 percent of Penske's automotive retail gross profit.A recovering U.S. auto sales market has led to a rise in the supply of used cars, leading to a drop in prices, with the National Automobile Dealers Association forecasting a nearly 7 percent drop in average prices this year. Wholesale used vehicle prices fell 0.3 percent in September, their fifth consecutive monthly decline, according to automobile auction company Manheim Inc.Lithia said used car retail same-store sales increased 13 percent in the third quarter, better than the 11 percent rise in new vehicle same-store sales.But margins in the used vehicles business were about 130 basis points lower than Lithia's expectations, mainly due to the fall in prices of used vehicles, it said.Lithia estimated an adjusted profit of $1.30 to $1.32 per share for the third quarter, below its forecast of $1.36 to $1.38.Lithia also cut its fourth-quarter earnings forecast to $1.17 to $1.19 per share from $1.23 to $1.26.Lithia's shares were down 18 percent at $66.40 on Monday afternoon. AutoNation was down 5.5 percent at $48.51, Penske was off 7 percent at $38.24, CarMax was lower 1 percent at $45.06 and Sonic was also down 7 percent at $22.45.

Shares of the largest U.S. auto dealer group were up 5.4 percent at $54.81.Jackson said the favorable credit environment is “very good, very rational, very sustainable. I do not view approaching 17 million as the beginning of the end (of the recovery).

In 2009, U.S. auto sales hit 10.4 million vehicles, the lowest level since World War Two, when adjusted for population growth.One result of the downturn is the current record-high age of vehicles on U.S. roads, 11.4 years, according to Polk-IHS Automotive data.

He said his projected 2015 figure of 17.1 million is not wild-eyed optimism, when one considers that reaching that level would represent a growth rate of 3.6 percent.  ""We aren’t quite as optimistic,"" said Jeff Schuster, lead forecaster for industry consultants LMC Automotive, which expects 16.8 million in U.S. auto sales next year, up around 2 percent.""LMC thinks there is some upside to that but that depends on the overall economy and timing of the rise in interest rates,"" Schuster said.

39,"   By Jim Forsyth | SAN ANTONIO  SAN ANTONIO A Texas plumber whose company pickup truck with logo and name clearly visible appeared in a photograph of a militant wielding an anti-aircraft weapon in Syria has sued the dealer he sold it to, saying the harassment it generated has damaged his business.Mark Oberholtzer, the owner of Mark-1 Plumbing of Texas City, said he sold the pickup in October 2013 and was shocked to see the photo on social media.Mark Oberholtzer said in a lawsuit seeking $1 million damages that he has been forced to carry a gun for protection and was grilled by investigators from the Department of Homeland security and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.The photo was tweeted in December 2014 by a group called the Ansar al-Deen front and describes the truck as being used against the Syrian government in Aleppo, the lawsuit said. The precise affiliation of the participants at the time of the photo was unclear. ""By the end of the day, Mark-1's office, Mark-1's business phone, and Mark's personal cell had received over 1,000 phone calls from around the nation,"" said the lawsuit, filed on Wednesday in Harris County State District Court in Houston.The lawsuit said the largely harassing calls contained threats of violence, property damage, injury and even death. Some callers sang in Arabic and others yelled obscenities at whoever answered the telephone, it said.The lawsuit said the plumbing company had sold up to 10 pickup trucks to different dealers in Texas with the common practice of removing decals or decorative stickers before their sale. Oberholtzer's lawsuit said he sold the pickup to Charlie Thomas Ford, which does business as AutoNation Ford Gulf Freeway in Houston. Dealer representatives told him they would take the stickers off because they had a better system for removing them without damaging the paint, it said.Instead, the pickup was sold with decals and all and shipped to Turkey where it was obtained by militants, the lawsuit said. A representative from the dealership did not immediately respond to inquiries about the suit on Monday. A spokesman for the parent company AutoNation  responded on Monday.""We feel it is very unfortunate that the customer is going through this,"" the AutoNation spokesman said. ""This vehicle came to us, and was sent to the auction and the markings should have come off at the auction. That did not happen. We feel this is unfortunate.""

40,"   By Joseph White | LAS VEGAS  LAS VEGAS The head of the largest U.S. auto dealer group warned on Wednesday that automakers and dealers must avoid the problems in the years immediately following 2000, when lofty incentives kept sales volume high but cut profits. AutoNation Inc Chief Executive Officer Mike Jackson said in an interview that the industry was ""entering a new chapter"" where underlying demand for new vehicles, particularly cars, is weakening.Jackson expressed concern that high incentives could cut into automakers' and dealers' profits.""We really have to watch the quality of volume,"" he said. ""We have to find the right balance between price and volume."" Jackson said the industry was not about to collapse after a record 2015, when about 17.4 million vehicles were sold. He said 2016 sales would top 17 million but did not give a specific projection. Some industry analysts have put the figure at 18 million. U.S. sales for December rose 9 percent, but Jackson said that was a quirk of the calendar. Excluding the additional weekend for 2015, last month's sales were essentially flat with a year earlier. AutoNation shares fell as much as 14.5 percent on Wednesday morning after the company said it expected to report $250 to $300 less gross profit per vehicle for the fourth quarter.At midday, AutoNation shares were down 11.6 percent at $50.12 after hitting $48.50, their lowest since October 2014. “The fourth-quarter industry sales environment was more push versus pull,"" Jackson said in a statement early on Wednesday.In recent years, the U.S. auto market has shifted away from traditional cars, which include sedans and hatchbacks, and toward SUVs, crossover vehicles and trucks.""Cars are the problem,"" Jackson said, while ""trucks are beautiful"" when it comes to recent sales performance.

41,"  (Adds more CEO comment, background, share price fall)By Joseph WhiteLAS VEGAS Jan 6 The head of the largest U.S. auto dealer group warned on Wednesday that automakers and dealers must avoid the problems in the years immediately following 2000, when lofty incentives kept sales volume high but cut profits.AutoNation Inc Chief Executive Officer Mike Jackson said in an interview that the industry was ""entering a new chapter"" where underlying demand for new vehicles, particularly cars, is weakening.Jackson expressed concern that high incentives could cut into automakers' and dealers' profits.""We really have to watch the quality of volume,"" he said. ""We have to find the right balance between price and volume."" Jackson said the industry was not about to collapse after a record 2015, when about 17.4 million vehicles were sold. He said 2016 sales would top 17 million but did not give a specific projection. Some industry analysts have put the figure at 18 million.U.S. sales for December rose 9 percent, but Jackson said that was a quirk of the calendar. Excluding the additional weekend for 2015, last month's sales were essentially flat with a year earlier.AutoNation shares fell as much as 14.5 percent on Wednesday morning after the company said it expected to report $250 to $300 less gross profit per vehicle for the fourth quarter. At midday, AutoNation shares were down 11.6 percent at $50.12 after hitting $48.50, their lowest since October 2014.""The fourth-quarter industry sales environment was more push versus pull,"" Jackson said in a statement early on Wednesday. In recent years, the U.S. auto market has shifted away from traditional cars, which include sedans and hatchbacks, and toward SUVs, crossover vehicles and trucks.""Cars are the problem,"" Jackson said, while ""trucks are beautiful"" when it comes to recent sales performance.He said he was not pointing to any automaker when it comes to layering on incentives to push sales.But he warned that the whole industry must avoid raising incentives to artificially inflate sales, as it did in the early years of this century.The 17.4 million in U.S. auto sales for 2015 eclipsed the former record of 17.35 million vehicles set in 2000.

43,"   By Joseph White  AutoNation Inc (AN.N) Chief Executive Mike Jackson told Reuters on Thursday the U.S. auto retailer will cut new vehicle orders as part of a push to reduce its stocks of unsold vehicles by 10 to 15 percent this year.Jackson said AutoNation's inventories of unsold vehicles are 13 percent higher than a year ago, and contributed to the No. 1 U.S. auto retailer's weaker-than-expected fourth-quarter results.""In a growing market you can be aggressive,"" Jackson said in an interview. ""Once you hit a plateau you have to bring those inventories into line.

Revenues rose nearly 6 percent in the quarter to $5.34 billion, but steeper price cuts, particularly for luxury models and smaller cars, hurt profits, the company said.  Jackson has pressured automakers to hold vehicle production and inventories in check before, using his platform as head of the largest U.S. auto dealership chain with 342 new vehicle franchises. With gasoline prices low, truck and sport utility vehicle sales remain strong, Jackson said. But demand for smaller, Asian brand cars is weak. Luxury vehicle demand was also weaker than AutoNation expected in the fourth quarter, Jackson said. Profits from the chain's luxury brand stores fell by 10 percent from a year earlier, he said. Falling sales in Texas, where low oil prices have hurt the state's petroleum industry, also dragged on AutoNation's performance, the company said. AutoNation shares tumbled 7.1 percent to $40.93 in morning trading on the results, which fell short of analysts' expectations. Jackson said the company will move to cut marketing and staffing costs in addition to cutting vehicle orders and managing down inventory.U.S. car and light truck sales should stay at relatively strong levels in excess of 17 million vehicles for 2016, Jackson said. However, he said the second half of this year could be more difficult than the first half. AutoNation will push to reduce inventories during the first half of the year, he said.
