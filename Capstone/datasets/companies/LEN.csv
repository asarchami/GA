The comments ended a two-day advance on Wall Street that had taken the S&P 500 near record levels.* Geopolitical concerns also continued to weigh on sentiment as Russian troops seized two Ukrainian naval bases, including a headquarters in the Crimean port of Sevastopol. The United States warned Russia that it was on a ""dark path"" to isolation in the biggest crisis between the two countries since the Cold War.* While few U.S. companies have outsized exposure to the region, investors are concerned about the fallout to any escalation in tension. * Lennar Corp rose 2 percent in premarket trading after the homebuilder reported a sharp jump in its first-quarter profit, helped by higher prices. The results come a day after KB Home posted similarly strong results in a bullish read on the housing market. The iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF  edged 0.5 percent higher premarket.* In a statement released on Wednesday, the U.S. central bank made clear that it would rely on a wide range of measures in deciding when to raise interest rates, dropping the unemployment rate as its definitive metric. Subsequently, Yellen said the ""considerable period"" between the end of the Fed's bond-buying stimulus program and the first rate increase from the central bank could be six months, raising questions about the timing of a rate hike.* S&P 500 futures fell 4.7 points and were below fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures fell 39 points and Nasdaq 100 futures fell 10.25 points. * The S&P 500 is within 1 percent of its record closing high, but volume has been anemic on positive market days, suggesting limited conviction behind the move.* Volume is expected to surge on Friday as options expiration takes place alongside multiple index rebalances. Credit Suisse estimates $14 billion in gross trading will stem from the S&P 500 index rebalance, with another $6 billion coming from rebalancing in other indexes.* In the latest economic data, jobless claims rose by 5,000 in the latest week, less than expected. At 10 a.m. (1400 GMT), February existing home sales and the March business activity index from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve will be released, with both seen rebounding from weakness in the previous month.* Jabil Circuit Inc forecast 2015 core earnings above Wall Street estimates as the struggling contract electronics maker expects to recover from the loss of its business with BlackBerry Ltd . Shares rose 2.2 percent to $18.66 before the bell.* U.S. shares of GlaxoSmithKline  fell 1.8 percent to $53.71 in premarket trading after an experimental cancer vaccine failed in a second test, but the British pharmaceutical company said it still hoped to identify a sub-group of patients in which it would work.

4,"   By Beth Pinsker | NEW YORK, April 30  NEW YORK, April 30 When it came time for Tom Moser and his wife to consider having his 83-year-old father move in with them, a house with a special multigenerational floor plan solved their problems - and may have saved his dad's life.For the same $335,000 he might have paid for a traditional home in the Tucson suburbs, Moser, 61, was able to pick a ""Next Gen"" model from Lennar Corp, one of the biggest U.S. homebuilders. It had an 800-square-foot house-within-a-house for his dad that had a separate entrance and its own patio, plus a bedroom, sitting area, and bathroom.One morning, Moser noticed his dad didn't look right, and at the emergency room they caught a heart problem early enough to save him. ""If he had been in his own home, he would have sat in the chair with his clicker, and I would have found him days later,"" Moser says.More than 50 million Americans already live in multigenerational situations, according to Pew Research, and the number is expected to grow as baby boomers age. For an increasing number of families, clearing out an extra room for Grandma (or for ""boomerang"" kids and grandchildren) isn't good enough. Homebuilders are responding with new models that have separate wings, attached apartments, dual master suites or finished basements.""The great thing is that it is independent living,"" says Jeff Roos, who originated the Next Gen design for Lennar as Western regional president, and has overseen sales of 1,700 multigenerational units in the last two years. Mega-builder Toll Brothers Inc has similar models in 20 states, which account for about 2 percent of sales. Prices range from $250,000 and up depending on the area and features, says Tim Gehman, director of design for Toll Architecture.There are also a myriad of small builders in the game that homebuyers can find through real estate agents or local searches. Gertz Fine Homes, which builds between 12-30 houses a year near Portland, Oregon, says about 30 percent of sales are now multigenerational models, which can cost around $600,000. DEFINE WHAT YOU NEED Privacy seems to be the prime concern of most people about to enter multigenerational living situations - otherwise any four- or five-bedroom house might do.""They key is to balance proximity with privacy,"" says John Graham, co-author of ""All in the Family: A Practical Guide to Successful Multigenerational Living."" He says the most important features people look for are: private entrance, separate kitchenette (often without a full stove because of zoning laws) and no stairs.One layout that works for many people is called a ""dual master"" - where at least two bedrooms have their own private bathrooms; sometimes one is on the ground floor. This is the type of house that Susan Couveau, 61, is looking for near Portland, Oregon from Gertz to accommodate her 38-year-old disabled son and her 78-year old mother, who now has an upstairs spare room but may not be able to do stairs much longer.ULTIMATE PRIVACY The gold standard has become an internal apartment - what might also be called a mother-in-law apartment, maids' quarters or casita - that is usually on the ground floor. Moser saw this layout in a house he visited and the next day did an internet search for ""multigenerational housing."" He found a Lennar development in his area, and within days put down a deposit on a Next Gen home.The plan was so appealing that Moser's sister bought the plot next door and built a Next Gen home so her 90-year-old in-laws could move in. For a few months, a grown daughter and her children also lived there - four generations under one roof.Moser's 83-year-old mother-in-law didn't want to be left out, so she bought the plot on the other side and built a traditional home for herself.Communities filled with multigenerational clusters like this are springing up all over, says Keller Williams real estate agent Kevin Kieffer, based in Danville, California. The sales now account for 5 to 10 percent of his business, boosted by international clients moving from Asia and India. His last multigen sale was a 4,200 square foot home for $1.2 million.In areas where there is not a lot of new construction, the search can be harder, says Brandon McNamee, a Coldwell Banker real estate agent in the St. Louis, Missouri area. He had a family of seven people, ranging from age 3 to 81, ask him to find them a house where they could all live together. ""It took us months,"" McNamee says.McNamee found them a 3,500-square-foot ranch for $520,000 with a master suite on each side of the house and a finished basement with two bedrooms, full bath and a wet bar.""A lot of families might say, that's too close together, I couldn't handle it. But it worked for us,"" says Moser. ""I think more and more communities will have these choices. Multigen will be the norm.""   (Follow us @ReutersMoney or here.

8,"  Troy Matteson briefly eyed a 59 as he snapped a season-long slump to match his lowest ever score on the PGA Tour with a 61 for fourth place after the second round of the Greenbrier Classic on Friday.American Matteson enjoyed a magnificent day on the greens, using his putter just 19 times as he racked up nine birdies to trail leader Billy Hurley III by two strokes on Greenbrier's Old White course in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia .""This was unlike any day I've had this year but I've always been a streaky putter. When I get hot, it usually falls in from just about anywhere,"" Matteson told PGATour.com after posting a seven-under 133 total.Hurley shot a blemish-free 63 to finish on nine-under, a shot better than Kevin Chappell (65) and Chris Stroud (66) on an all-American leaderboard on the country's Independence Day.Eight-time major champion Tom Watson, 64, came within four strokes of matching his age and made the cut, eight strokes behind.Matteson had missed the cut in his previous four starts but after a birdie at his penultimate hole stood on the final tee with thoughts of matching the 59 fired by Australian Stuart Appleby, who shot the rare number at the same venue four years ago to win the title.Needing a hole-in-one at the par-three 18th to become only the seventh player on tour to break 60, Matteson took dead aim with a pitching wedge from 163 yards but could only find a bunker.""I was like, I've just got to take a shot at it,"" the 34-year-old said.  ""How many shots are you going to get? I just pushed it, just very slightly.""Matteson is enduring a dismal season - ranking 162nd on the PGA Tour money list and 565th in the world - and has not recorded a top-40 finish since November. STREAKY PLAYER He has always been a player to ride a hot streak, though, as he demonstrated when he carded successive rounds of 61 en route to his second PGA Tour victory at the 2009 Frys.com Open.""You're going to have some rough spots in your career at some point,"" he said. ""I've been working on some new swing stuff.""I was a little worried this morning. You're never quite sure when it's only been a day or two, obviously today I hit it much better."" Matteson's 61 was the joint second lowest score on the 2013-14 PGA Tour. American J.J. Henry fired an 11-under 60 in the first round of the Shriners Hospitals for Children Open in Las Vegas, while Argentina's Andres Romero shot 61 on the same day.Hurley, a former U.S. Navy officer, felt that accurate driving had been the key to his score.""I drove it really well today, hit a lot of fairways, and when you get the ball in the fairway around here, you get a lot of mid, short-irons and you can attack some flags,"" he said.

The shift bodes well for D.R. Horton Inc, the largest U.S. homebuilder, and rivals Lennar Corp and PulteGroup Inc, each of which gets a large part of its revenue from these states.RBC analyst Robert Wetenhall expects orders at the three homebuilders to rise about 16 percent on average next year.

This growth, along with low interest rates and proposed rules to let Americans buy homes with down payments as low as 3 percent, augments the forecast for a more stable housing recovery next year.A widespread land shortage forced PulteGroup and D.R. Horton to slow the rate at which they built homes. The duo have been buying land this year, but their holdings are still less than Lennar's, especially in the west. Lennar, which builds about 40 percent of its homes in the West Coast, southeast Florida and Houston, has best weathered the slowdown in the housing market, thanks to its substantial land assets.At 13.5 percent, the company is expected to post the highest return on equity in 2015 compared with its main rivals, according to Wetenhall.The forecast for KB Home is the lowest at 5.3 percent. Although the company builds almost a third of its homes in California, inconsistent execution has held back its share price, Wetenhall said.The median price targets on the stocks of D.R. Horton, Lennar and PulteGroup have increased in the past month, while KB Home's target was unchanged, according to Thomson Reuters data.

36,"   By Ankit Ajmera and Michael Flaherty  PulteGroup Inc (PHM.N) said on Thursday it has appointed three new directors to its board as part of a settlement deal with Elliott Management Corp, the hedge fund founded by billionaire Paul Singer.Shares of the No. 3 U.S. homebuilder rose as much as 5.3 percent to close at $21.51.The appointment comes as the company searches for a new chief executive after Chairman and CEO Richard Dugas announced his resignation, effective May 2017, bowing to a demand from founder and largest shareholder Bill Pulte.Elliott Management, the activist hedge fund founded by billionaire Paul Singer, took a 4.7 percent stake in PulteGroup in June.""The final candidate selection (for board's independent directors) was the result of a fruitful collaboration and discussion with Elliott,"" Dugas said.PulteGroup appointed John Peshkin, Scott Powers and Joshua Gotbaum as independent directors, expanding the board's size to 13. Peshkin is a managing partner at private real estate investment group Vanguard Land LLC, while Scott Powers most recently was the executive vice-president of State Street Corp (STT.N). Joshua Gotbaum is a guest scholar at the Brookings Institution.Peshkin and Gotbaum will also join PulteGroup's previously established CEO search committee.Dugas said he hoped that the CEO search committee would be able to ""wrap up their work"" over the next couple of months.PulteGroup said the homebuilder and affiliates of Elliott have agreed that Elliott will support PulteGroup's slate of director nominees at its 2017 shareholder meeting. PulteGroup's home sales have underperformed those of D.R. Horton Inc (DHI.N) and Lennar Corp (LEN.N) in 2015, dropping 0.4 percent to 17,127 homes.D.R. Horton's home sales rose 28 percent last year, and Lennar's increased 16 percent.PulteGroup also said it plans to slow land acquisition, and use cash flows from operations to help fund repurchase of $1.5 billion of shares over the next six quarters. Bill Pulte said in a letter addressed to shareholders that he was satisfied with the initial progress made at PulteGroup toward addressing a prolonged underperformance of its shares. He, however, added that the company still had a lot of ground to cover, especially on cost controls and boosting volumes.PulteGroup's share price has risen about 19 percent since April 4, when Pulte expressed his ""extreme disappointment"" in the leadership of Dugas and asked the board to speed up the succession plan.Elliott believes the buyback, board augmentation and PulteGroup's current land and community investments can almost double the stock to $35-40 per share, said a person familiar with the hedge fund's thinking.
