1,"   By Noel Randewich | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Investors looking for stability and dividends have been pouring money into consumer staples stocks of late, ignoring warnings from Wall Street's analysts about pricey valuations for companies like Clorox (CLX.N) and Campbell Soup (CPB.N).Widely viewed as relatively safe bets in a world of macroeconomic worries, shares of companies selling everyday consumer products like processed food and cleaning supplies have outperformed most other sectors in the past year, and fund flow data suggests investors expect more of the same.The number of new institutional owners, like hedge funds, pension funds and mutual funds, of Campbell Soup in the last quarter has jumped 92 percent, according to research firm Morningstar. New institutional owners of Coca Cola Co rose 81 percent.In the past two weeks, the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPRD ETF (XLP) attracted $333 million in net flows while just $105 million went into the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR fund (XLY), according to ETF.com.With relatively high dividend yields, including a 4 percent annual payout to shareholders from Philip Morris International (PM.N), consumer staples companies remain a key holding for investors worried about a shaky global economy, even as the United States shows signs of slow improvement.  Consumer staples companies in the S&P 500 are expected on average to post 3.7 percent higher earnings in 2016, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. That is better than an expected 0.8-percent increase across the S&P 500 but not as good as the 12.4-percent earnings jump predicted for the consumer discretionary sector. ""We still want a fair amount of exposure to staples,"" said Thomas Martin, a portfolio manager at GLOBALT Investments, which owns shares in Campbell, Kraft Heinz Co (KHC.O), Estee Lauder Companies Inc (EL.N), Wal-Mart Stores (WMT.N) and tobacco companies. ""The economy is still bumping along on a slow-growth trajectory,"" he said. The S&P consumer staples index .SPLRCS now trades at about 20 times expected earnings, compared with 17 for the consumer discretionary index .SPLRCD, according to Thomson Reuters data. Following the consumer staples index's 12 percent rise in the past year, some analysts warn of high valuations, with General Mills (GIS.N), Procter & Gamble (PG.N) and most other companies in the sector trading above 20 times expected earnings, compared with an average of 17 across the S&P 500. ""On the consumer defensive side, we view in general the industry as a bit inflated,"" said Morningstar analyst Erin Lash. A year ago, Campbell Soup, Kellogg (K.N), McCormick & Company (MKC.N) and Clorox were among the 10 S&P 500 stocks with the worst average recommendations by sell-side analysts. Many of them warned about a strong dollar's impact on demand overseas and stagnant sales as consumer tastes shifted toward fresher foods.But since then, those stocks have each gained between 21 percent and 31 percent, lifted by cost-cutting initiatives that have improved margins and progress updating their product lineups to appeal to new consumer tastes for ""natural"" and organic food. The S&P 500 is up 1 percent from a year ago.

4,"   By Jonathan Stempel  A federal judge in Chicago on Monday refused to dismiss a lawsuit in which wheat futures and options traders accused Kraft Heinz Co and Mondelez International Inc of illegally manipulating the grain's price at their expense.U.S. District Judge Edmond Chang said traders may pursue claims that a large and, in their view, unnecessary late 2011 purchase by Kraft Foods Inc of wheat futures contracts violated the Sherman antitrust law and the Commodity Exchange Act.In a 66-page decision, Chang also dismissed claims that the defendants conducted offsetting ""wash trades"" over roughly a decade to create an illusion of greater market activity. He said the traders can try to bring those claims again.Kraft and Mondelez were named as defendants because most of the alleged suspicious activity occurred before Kraft Foods Inc split in two in 2012. Mondelez brands now include snack foods such as Oreos, Ritz crackers and Wheat Thins.Many of the allegations were similar to those raised by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission in an April 2015 lawsuit against Kraft and Mondelez. A Kraft Heinz spokesman and a Mondelez spokeswoman declined to comment on the decision.Vincent Briganti, a lawyer for the traders, said he was pleased the court found ""multiple viable claims.""The CFTC said Kraft Foods bought $90 million of December 2011 wheat futures, giving it a dominant position in that market, despite never intending to take possession of the grain. It said Kraft Foods did so to depress prices in the cash wheat market, because sellers might believe the company needed less wheat, and inflate futures prices. It said the strategy led to more than $5.4 million of illegal profit.Last December, another judge rejected a defense motion to  dismiss the CFTC lawsuit.Both companies have said Mondelez expects to bear most costs from that case. Mondelez believes any court-ordered fine or settlement would not be material to investors, the company spokeswoman said.Kraft merged last year with H.J. Heinz Co to create Kraft Heinz, whose products include Kraft cheese, Heinz ketchup, Oscar Mayer deli meats and Maxwell House coffee.Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc owns a roughly 26.8 percent stake in Kraft Heinz.    The case is Ploss v. Kraft Foods Group Inc et al, U.S. District Court, Northern District of Illinois, No. 15-02937.

11,"   By Jonathan Stempel  Berkshire Hathaway Inc on Friday said its second-quarter profit rose 25 percent, helped by improvement in insurance underwriting, investment gains and the purchase of Precision Castparts Corp, Warren Buffett's largest acquisition.But operating results fell short of analyst forecasts, as depressed oil prices and coal demand weighed on volume at the conglomerate's BNSF railroad unit, while units serving the oil, gas and heavy equipment industries struggled. Other businesses, including the Geico auto insurer, fared better.Net income for Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire rose to $5 billion, or $3,042 per Class A share, from $4.01 billion, or $2,442, a year earlier.Operating profit rose 18 percent to $4.61 billion, or $2,803 per Class A share, from $3.89 billion, or $2,367. Analysts on average expected operating profit of about $2,911 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Revenue rose 6 percent to $54.46 billion. Book value per share, Buffett's preferred measure of growth, rose 1.7 percent from the end of March to $160,009.Buffett has over the years diversified Berkshire far beyond its insurance roots, including through the $32.1 billion January purchase of Precision Castparts, which makes aircraft parts, and February acquisition of Duracell, which makes batteries.But many operations remain anchored in the United States, and several struggled with the same pressures stemming from low commodities and materials prices and demand.""Some of the 'old economy' businesses lagged, hurt by the weaker energy sector, but the insurance businesses turned around, especially Geico,"" S&P Global analyst Cathy Seifert said in an interview. ""This is a conglomerate, and you have to take the good with the bad.""GEICO, KRAFT HEINZ  Insurance underwriting swung to a $337 million profit from a year-earlier loss of $38 million.That helped boost overall insurance profit, including investment income, 40 percent to $1.32 billion.The improvement included a near tripling of pre-tax underwriting gain at Geico, which added customers and boosted premiums while its rate of loss claims fell.Meanwhile, currency fluctuations helped Berkshire's namesake reinsurance business swing to a $184 million pre-tax gain from a year-earlier $411 million loss.Float, or the amount of insurance premiums collected before claims are paid and which help fund Berkshire's growth, grew to $90 billion from $89 billion at the end of March. Investments and derivatives overall generated $394 million of profit, compared with $123 million a year earlier.Most resulted from Kraft Heinz Co's redemption of $8.32 billion of preferred stock that Berkshire held.Berkshire still owns a 26.8 percent stake in the food company, which is run day-to-day by Brazilian private equity firm 3G Capital.The redemption also left Berkshire with more cash, $72.68 billion, than it had before it acquired Precision.""Investors should expect more acquisitions,"" Seifert said. She has a ""hold"" rating on Berkshire, which does not pay a dividend and has outgained the Standard & Poor's 500 this year. PRECISION The April-to-June period was Precision's first full quarter as a Berkshire unit, and helped boost pre-tax profit in Berkshire's industrial products sector by 34 percent.Excluding Precision and Duracell, however, profit in that sector fell, hurt by what Berkshire called ""soft market conditions"" and competitive pressures that drove prices lower.BNSF saw profit fall 20 percent to $772 million and revenue drop 15 percent to $4.59 billion, though speed and on-time performance improved following costly capital upgrades in 2015.Among other businesses, Berkshire Hathaway Energy, a utility unit mostly owned by Berkshire, saw profit fall 4 percent to $482 million, hurt by lower revenue from renewable energy and changes in the value of interest-rate swaps.Berkshire has roughly 90 operating businesses, including smaller units that sell such things as candy, ice cream, insulation, jewelry, kitchenware, running shoes and underwear.As of June 30 it also owned about $133 billion of stocks including Kraft Heinz, Wells Fargo & Co, Coca-Cola Co and IBM Corp. Berkshire maintained it has no plan to sell IBM, despite sitting on a $1.5 billion loss.In Friday trading, Berkshire's Class A shares rose $3,180 to $218,010, and its Class B shares rose $2.53 to $145.65. The shares are 5 percent below their December 2014 record highs.

22,"   By Guillermo Parra-Bernal and Bruno Federowski | SAO PAULO  SAO PAULO 3G Capital Inc, the buyout firm controlled by Brazilian billionaire financier Jorge Paulo Lemann, is raising between $8 billion and $10 billion to finance an acquisition of a global consumer goods firm, a Brazil-based blog said on Tuesday.According to the Brazil Journal blog, which cited people close to 3G, at least 10 wealthy Brazilian investors had already committed a minimum $100 million each to the new fund. Alexandre Behring, the 3G partner who is in charge of the firm's day-to-day operations, has remained closely involved in the fundraising effort, the blog said.Calls to 3G's office in Rio de Janeiro went unanswered.Investors have long speculated what the next target for Lemann, who is worth $28 billion according to Forbes Magazine, and 3G could be Oreo cookies maker Mondelez International Inc (MDLZ.O) or General Mills Inc (GIS.N), which owns Pillsbury and Betty Crocker.  The blog said an acquisition would be done through Kraft Heinz Co (KHC.O), in which 3G has a 24 percent stake.Shares in Mondelez gained 3.7 percent to $45.87, while General Mills added 2.4 percent to $63.32 in mid-afternoon trading on Tuesday. According to the blog, Lemann's camp has declined politely checks between $20 million and $50 million for the new fund, on the grounds that larger money commitments could optimize any fundraising efforts. Tennis player Roger Federer and supermodel Gisele Bündchen are among investors in the new vehicle, Brazil Journal said.Lemann, a globe-trotting financier with Swiss roots, rose to prominence over the past decade following a series of mega deals that drew praise and funding from U.S. billionaire Warren Buffett. Both tycoons have teamed up several times in the past, the most recent being a joint effort to buy ketchup maker H.J. Heinz Co for $23.2 billion three years ago. Harvard University-educated Lemann and longtime partners Carlos Alberto Sicupira and Marcel Telles are 3G Capital's main partners. They are one of the largest investors in Anheuser Busch InBev SA (ABI.BR), the world's largest beer maker.Buffett also helped finance the 3G-engineered merger of Burger King Corp with Canadian donut chain Tim Hortons, creating Restaurant Brands International Inc (QSR.TO).
