We are focused on improving performance of all of our businesses"", Ghasemi said on a conference call on Wednesday. The CEO's messages were ""well-received by investors who were looking for changes in the company and ways to improve margins,"" SunTrust Robinson analyst James Sheehan said.Air Products reported a 9 percent rise in third-quarter profit to $314 million, or $1.46 per share. The company, however, tightened its continuing operations profit forecast range for 2014. Air Products expects profit of $5.72 to $5.77 per share, compared with $5.70 to $5.85 it forecast earlier.Lower industrial activity in Latin America and moderating growth in emerging markets is expected to weigh on the company's profit this year, Sheehan said.Bigger rival Praxair Inc, also cut the upper end of its full-year profit forecast. The company's second-quarter growth was hurt by weak sales volume in South America, mainly due to negative industrial production in Brazil. Industrial output in Brazil, once one of the most dynamic of emerging economies, has slumped over the last three months and is on track to shrink more than 1 percent this year.Praxair earned 16 percent of its total quarterly revenue from Latin American countries.Air Products, which has a relatively lower exposure to the region, is depending on improvement of economic activity in the United States.Air Products shares were trading up 3 percent at $134.56 on Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange, while that of Praxair were down less than a percent.

6,"   By Nita Bhalla  BHOPAL, India (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Hundreds of protesters gathered on Wednesday outside the abandoned factory which caused the world's deadliest industrial disaster in the Indian city of Bhopal, burning effigies and demanding justice for survivors suffering 30 years later.Elderly women and men, some of whom were injured by the toxic cyanide gas leak, together with activists, supporters and children - some born with physical and mental disabilities - held up banners and chanted ""We want justice!""In the early hours of Dec. 3, 1984, around 40 tons of methyl isocyanate gas accidentally leaked from a pesticide factory owned by U.S. multinational Union Carbide Corp. and was carried by the wind into the surrounding slums.The government recorded 5,295 deaths. Activists estimate 25,000 deaths from illnesses since the leak. Many people still suffer from cancer, blindness, respiratory problems and immune and neurological disorders, with little support, they say.""I was pregnant and living ... near the factory on that night. We woke up with our eyes burning and could hear people outside screaming,"" said Rambhai Kailash, 50, whose daughter was born with muscular dystrophy and whose husband died from cancer five years after the disaster. ""The compensation I received at the time was so little that it was immediately used up on medical treatment for my husband and daughter,"" she said as protesters lit a massive diamond-shaped effigy with a skull and ""Dow Chemical"" painted on it. Activists accuse the Indian and U.S. governments and the Dow Chemical Company, which now owns Union Carbide, of not doing enough to support victims of the disaster. They want more financial compensation for the victims and the removal of thousands of tons of toxic waste around the plant, which has seeped into the ground with activists saying this is poisoning the water of 50,000 people.     CALLS FOR FURTHER ACTION Dow Chemical has denied liability, saying it bought Union Carbide a decade after the firm settled its liabilities to the Indian government in 1989 by paying $470 million.But activists said that was a paltry sum based on the extent of human suffering and various petitions to hold Dow to account and insist on increased compensation and cleaning up the waste are being pressed in Indian and U.S. courts.""The time has come to bring Dow and Carbide to justice. No more hiding behind share ownership and legal loopholes,"" said Salil Shetty, Secretary-General of Amnesty International. A spokeswoman for Dow declined to comment, referring calls to the company's subsidiary Union Carbide Corp. An email from Tomm Sprick of the Union Carbide Information Centre said the company was not doing any interviews and referred to information on its website which features many facts ""which have been forgotten or overlooked in the past 30 years.""In an email last week, Sprick said UCC had the ""utmost respect and sympathy for the victims"" but many of the issues ""have already been resolved and responsibilities assigned.""The government of central Madhya Pradesh state, where Bhopal is located, held a prayer meeting on Wednesday to mark the 30th anniversary of the leak and the Indian parliament in New Delhi observed a two-minute silence for the victims of the disaster.  Government officials deny neglecting victims and failing to help many survivors. They say the Supreme Court decides who is eligible for compensation and free healthcare after receiving a list of the affected people.""This has been put before the Supreme Court and the court has decided, after extensive examination of their cases, what is to be paid and to whom,"" Pravir Krishn, the state's principal secretary at the department in charge of rehabilitation for Bhopal's victims, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.Krishn said some families seeking compensation or medical help were not from contaminated locations, suggesting they falsely claimed to be victims of the tragedy.He said the state had provided 40 billion rupees ($650 million) to 575,000 people identified by the Supreme Court as being affected by the disaster, built state-of-the art hospitals and provided houses for many survivors.While many events surrounding the disaster's anniversary have focused on issues such as the lack of healthcare, compensation and job opportunities for survivors and their families, some have asked whether another Bhopal could happen.The Delhi-based think-tank Centre for Science and Environment released a book on Monday that said that while India has laws covering hazardous waste management and industrial disasters, there is no compliance.""While we have thankfully not witnessed another major Bhopal-type disaster in the last 30 years, we have a number of mini Bhopals - small types of gas leaks from industry - all over the country,"" said Sunita Narain, CSE's director.(This story was refiled to add dropped words in paragraph 19)",2014-12-03,PX,"Wed Dec 3, 2014 | 1:01pm EST",Victims call for justice 30 years after Bhopal disaster,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-india-bhopal-anniversary-idUSKCN0JH1RN20141203?type=companyNews

16,"   By Mike Stone and Jens Hack | NEW YORK/MUNICH  NEW YORK/MUNICH U.S. industrial gas supplier Praxair Inc (PX.N) and German peer Linde AG (LING.DE) are in early-stage talks about a merger to create a market leader with a value of more than $60 billion, Linde said on Tuesday, sending shares in both companies higher.An agreement would accelerate consolidation sweeping the industrial gas sector where slower economic growth has weakened demand in the manufacturing, metals and energy sectors and put pressure on smaller players to compete.A combination of Praxair and Linde, which supply gases such as nitrogen, argon and carbon dioxide, would face scrutiny from  regulators after other major deals, such as U.S. oilfield services provider Halliburton Co's (HAL.N) $34.6 billion acquisition of Baker Hughes Inc (BHI.N), were shot down due to antitrust concerns.Linde has a strong position in healthcare in North America, where it supplies gases to hospitals and patients with respiratory disorders.Praxair is more focused on industrial on-site production, which means a market share of close to 50 percent resulting from a merger should not spark opposition from U.S. anti-trust regulators, analysts said.Linde said talks were ongoing and had not yet yielded any concrete results or agreements.""Accordingly it is currently not foreseeable whether there will be any kind of transaction,"" it said in a statement. VARIETY OF OPTIONS Several people familiar with the matter had earlier told Reuters the two companies had held talks. One person had said Praxair was considering a takeover of Linde, while two other sources said Linde wanted a merger of equals.One of the sources said a share swap was one possible structure of a deal but that talks were still very preliminary.""A merger would be good for both companies, and for the sector as a whole,"" said Christopher Schaefer, a fund manager at Union Investment, a top-20 shareholder of Linde.

18,"   By Mike Stone and Jens Hack | NEW YORK/MUNICH  NEW YORK/MUNICH U.S. industrial gas supplier Praxair Inc (PX.N) and German peer Linde AG (LING.DE) are in early-stage talks about a merger to create a market leader with a value of more than $60 billion, Linde said on Tuesday, sending shares in both companies higher.An agreement would accelerate consolidation sweeping the industrial gas sector where slower economic growth has weakened demand in the manufacturing, metals and energy sectors and put pressure on smaller players to compete.A combination of Praxair and Linde, which supply gases such as nitrogen, argon and carbon dioxide, would face scrutiny from  regulators after other major deals, such as U.S. oilfield services provider Halliburton Co's (HAL.N) $34.6 billion acquisition of Baker Hughes Inc (BHI.N), were shot down due to antitrust concerns.Linde has a strong position in healthcare in North America, where it supplies gases to hospitals and patients with respiratory disorders.Praxair is more focused on industrial on-site production, which means a market share of close to 50 percent resulting from a merger should not spark opposition from U.S. anti-trust regulators, analysts said.Linde said talks were ongoing and had not yet yielded any concrete results or agreements.""Accordingly it is currently not foreseeable whether there will be any kind of transaction,"" it said in a statement. VARIETY OF OPTIONS Several people familiar with the matter had earlier told Reuters the two companies had held talks. One person had said Praxair was considering a takeover of Linde, while two other sources said Linde wanted a merger of equals.One of the sources said a share swap was one possible structure of a deal but that talks were still very preliminary.""A merger would be good for both companies, and for the sector as a whole,"" said Christopher Schaefer, a fund manager at Union Investment, a top-20 shareholder of Linde. Shares in Linde were up 9.2 percent at 152.15 euros, an eight-month high, by 1346 GMT, making them the top gainer on Germany's blue-chip index .GDAXI, which was down 0.7 percent.

The STOXX Europe 600 fell 0.8 percent. While it closed flat on Monday, it had touched its highest level since Britain voted in June to leave the European Union.Schindler Holding AG fell 4.3 percent, the biggest faller on the index after it cut the top end of its revenue growth outlook for the year as increasing uncertainty in the Chinese construction market and the recession in Brazil continues to hurt the Swiss elevator manufacturer.Industrial firm Rotork fell 2.1 percent, the top STOXX 600 faller, after HSBC cut the valve-control systems maker to ""reduce"" from ""hold"".K&S fell to a three year low, with the potash firm down 12 percent since results were announced last week. It dropped after UBS cut its target price on the stock and reiterated its ""sell"" rating, saying that potash prices were likely to stay under pressure.""We continue to see an oversupplied potash market... Closures are happening but the demand side of the equation does not look too favourable,"" analysts said in a note.At the other end of the STOXX 600, Switzerland's Geberit  rose 4.6 percent to a record high after it beat expectations with its second quarter results and struck a confident tone for its outlook. Linde was the top STOXX 600 riser, up 5.9 percent, after a source said U.S. industrial gas supplier Praxair Inc  is in early-stage talks to acquire its German peer and create a market leader with a value of more than $60 billion.The rise in Linde helped the STOXX 600 Chemicals index  into positive territory.The only other sector in positive territory was the Basic Resources sector, as results boosted miners.BHP Billiton turned higher and traded up 1.2 percent after early weakness. Despite posting a record loss, underlying profit beat expectations and the miner said it saw good growth in 2017.London-listed Chilean miner Antofagasta also rose after reporting a rise in first half profit.""Continued ramp-up of the Antucoya project which came on-line last quarter is helping along with a prudent attitude to capital management in light of the new commodity environment and still uncertain economic outlook,"" Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, said.""Management's view of an end to market oversupply by 2018 is also the right kind of sound to be making in order to entice bulls into a recovery story.""

38,"  MUNICH, Germany Oct 28 Germany's Linde , the world's biggest maker of industrial gases by sales, said on Friday it had launched a new efficiency programme following the collapse last month of its merger talks with U.S. rival Praxair.The programme, which Linde announced alongside forecast-beating third-quarter results, is designed to save an extra 370 million euros ($403 million) a year from 2019, on top of its existing scheme to save 180 million euros a year. Linde's third-quarter adjusted operating profit rose 3 percent to 1.01 billion euros, slightly above the average forecast of 992 million euros in a Reuters poll, while sales were flat at 4.41 billion euros, beating the poll average of 4.28 billion.

39,"   By Arno Schuetze | FRANKFURT  FRANKFURT Germany's Linde (LING.DE) is in talks with China's acquisitive transportation and leisure giant HNA Group over its temperature-controlled logistics unit Gist, two people close to the matter said.Linde said last month that it considered Gist a non-core asset and would sell it if anyone offered a good price for it.HNA's logistics arm includes a cold chain system logistics unit, which it could beef up with Gist, the people said, adding that no deal is certain yet and that one other Asian group remains interested in Gist. Gist delivers cooled food and beverages mainly in the United Kingdom and counts British retailer Marks and Spencer (MKS.L) as a key customer. It may reap a price of about 400 million pounds ($495 million), one of the sources said.Linde declined to comment while HNA was not immediately available for comment. HNA has snapped up several assets over the last couple of months including Swiss airline catering firm Gategroup as well as a stake in hotel group Hilton. Linde's planned divestment is unrelated to its failed plan to merge with peer Praxair, which was scrapped last month over issues such as headquarters and key personnel, the people said.

42,"   By Arno Schuetze and Jens Hack | FRANKFURT/MUNICH  FRANKFURT/MUNICH U.S. industrial gases group Praxair (PX.N) has revived efforts to combine with German rival Linde (LING.DE), seeking to overcome differences over key personnel and location of headquarters that scuppered previous talks in September.A person close to Munich-based Linde, which also operates medical gas and engineering businesses, told Reuters that Praxair had tried to address the main stumbling blocks to talks on creating a $60 billion-plus market leader.Linde's supervisory board is expected to discuss the fresh approach at its next regular meeting on Dec. 7, another person familiar with the matter told Reuters on Wednesday.Linde shares jumped 6.6 percent to 160 euros, a one-year high, outperforming a broadly unchanged DAX .GDAXI index of German blue-chip stocks.The failed merger talks led to changes at the top at Linde, with finance chief Georg Denoke leaving immediately and Chief Executive Wolfgang Buechele staying on only until April.That leaves Chairman Wolfgang Reitzle, Buechele predecessor as CEO, as the most powerful figure at Linde. Reitzle was seen as a driving force behind the initial merger talks but now faces the challenges of having to rebuild the group's leadership, cut costs and deal with the U.S. suitor.  Buechele said in October that a revival of merger talks was not on the cards and put the emphasis on a further restructuring to respond to low growth.TOUGH TIMES Linde, Praxair and peers Air Liquide (AIRP.PA) and Air Products (APD.N) are struggling with slower economic growth that has weakened demand in the manufacturing, metals and energy sectors, putting pressure on smaller players and leading to consolidation in the sector. Air Liquide bought Airgas Inc, the leader in U.S. packaged gases, in a $13.4 billion transaction finalised in May.Linde said late on Tuesday it was looking into a revised proposal it had received from Praxair about a merger of equals. Praxair later confirmed it approached Linde about resuming discussions about a potential merger.""We believe a merger could offer at least 13 percent upside to our standalone value for Linde,"" said UBS analyst Geoff Haire. The cutbacks Linde is pursuing on its own ""may not be enough to offset the impact of the low growth environment for gases coupled with continued pressure on healthcare pricing in the U.S. and limited growth for Engineering,"" Haire added.Praxair CEO Steve Angel said last month that his team had not had the chance to fully assess the future role of Linde's headquarters within a combined entity when talks ended and that he was open to resuming discussions.But negotiations are likely to be tough.""We expect Linde to try to command very favorable merger terms (share exchange ratio, Munich location, etc.) which Praxair, who is known for its bidding discipline, will struggle to accept,"" Bernstein analyst Jeremy Redenius said in a note on Wednesday.Praxair generates lower core earnings but with a higher margin over sales than its German peer. Both groups carry a broadly similar value on the stock market, Linde having a market capitalization of around 28 billion euros ($29.82 billion), compared with a figure of $35 billion for Praxair.

The two parties abandoned talks in September to create a $60 billion-plus market leader after failing to agree on where important functions would be located and who would occupy key positions. A brief statement from Linde on Tuesday did not specify whether new terms had been offered, while Praxair confirmed it approached Linde about resuming potential merger discussions.Earlier, Dow Jones and Reuters had cited sources as saying Praxair had made fresh overtures to Linde.

Praxair's shares closed up 2.9 percent at $122.18 in New York.Linde's chief executive told Reuters last month that reviving merger talks was not on the cards and announced a further restructuring programme instead.

45,"  FRANKFURT Linde (LING.DE) supervisory board Chairman Wolfgang Reitzle is still in favor of a tie-up between the German industrial gases maker and U.S. rival Praxair (PX.N), which has made a renewed merger proposal, German newspaper Handelsblatt reported.The business daily cited sources close to the supervisory board as saying that Reitzle preferred a tie-up over going it alone and was also concerned that Praxair might turn hostile.Praxair's recent concessions to Linde include giving the German group's Munich headquarters a bigger role than initially planned and as well as providing some job guarantees, Handelsblatt and daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung said in separate reports, without specifying their sources.    Praxair has revived efforts to combine with Linde, with sources telling Reuters on Wednesday it has tried to address the main stumbling blocks to merger talks. The collapse of initial negotiations in September led to the departure of finance chief Georg Denoke and Chief Executive Wolfgang Buechele staying on only until April, leaving Chairman Reitzle as the most powerful figure at Linde.

46,"   By Ludwig Burger, Greg Roumeliotis and Arno Schuetze | FRANKFURT  FRANKFURT Germany's Linde agreed to revive talks with U.S. rival Praxair  to create a $65 billion industrial gases giant which will have its main operations run from Connecticut, two sources familiar with the deal said on Wednesday.The deal is being pursued as a ""merger of equals"" thanks to a 50:50 valuation split, these people said.But a combined company will have its operating base in Danbury, Connecticut, where Praxair is headquartered and Praxair's Chief Executive Steve Angel will head the merged company, these sources said on Wednesday, after Linde confirmed it would resume talks.In a largely symbolic gesture, Linde will be the name of the combined company, and Wolfgang Reitzle, Linde's chairman would also be chairman of the combined firm, the sources said.   A ""meaningful"" representation would be retained in Germany, these people said, adding that the primary listing would be in New York and the secondary listing in Frankfurt.Talks broke down in September amid disagreements over where the combined firm would have its headquarters and research and development, as well as over who would occupy the main management roles, sources told Reuters at the time.On Wednesday Linde's chief executive Wolfgang Buechele paved the way to a revived deal by stepping down with immediate effect. ""With the resumption of the talks, a successful merger is now drawing near,"" Buechele said in a statement.Buechele will be replaced by Aldo Ernesto Belloni, a 66-year-old former executive board member who retired two years ago. ""With a succession plan in place, the necessary continuity is assured without interruption for the demanding tasks of the coming months,"" Buechele added, without elaborating on why he was leaving some four months earlier than planned.The companies now aim to have drawn up an outline agreement before the Christmas holidays, sources close to the matter said.Belloni, who retired at the end of 2014 after 14 years on Linde's management board, is a close ally of non-executive Chairman Wolfgang Reitzle, who needed to steady the ship after an exodus of key people in the wake of the collapse of initial merger talks with Praxair in September.Finance Chief Georg Denoke left immediately after the talks failed in September while Buechele said he would stay on only until April 2017, leaving Reitzle, Buechele's predecessor as CEO, to plot the company's future course.Linde and Praxair, alongside rivals Air Liquide and Air Products, are struggling with slower economic growth that has weakened demand from the manufacturing, metals and energy industries and put pressure on smaller players,  leading to further consolidation in the sector. Air Liquide bought Airgas Inc, the leader in U.S. packaged gases, in a $13.4 billion deal finalised in May.Praxair generates lower core earnings but with a higher sales margin than its German peer. Shares in Linde were up 2.4 percent at 160 euros on Wednesday, valuing the company at around 29.8 billion euros ($32 billion). Shares in Praxair were up 1.7 percent at $121,   giving it a market value of around $34.6 billion.Linde decided to resume negotiations after Praxair offered  to locate some central functions of the combined group in Germany, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Wednesday. Under the proposed new terms, one of the combined entity's executive board members would be based in Munich, where Linde is headquartered, and the main German sites would be preserved, the sources said.Linde said the supervisory board vote to resume talks was unanimous, meaning the board's labor representatives must have been won over.Sources close to the matter have said that opposition from the workers' representatives due to concerns for German jobs was a factor in the failure of talks in September.Still, the success of a deal hinges on a clear chain of command. On an earnings conference call on October 27, Praxair's Angel said a deal could yield significant synergies ""by ensuring upfront that leadership is unambiguous, and the company is operated in a clear and consistent way."" Angel said Praxair's “operational excellence"", could complement Linde's “technology in engineering.”Linde had already said last week it was considering a revised proposal it had received from Praxair about a potential merger of equals, which was confirmed by Praxair.
